Rating based on one play.
We had a lot of fun with this. Quite fiddly for a simple game, which makes learning it for the first game quite lengthy. We just about made it through to the voting stage on the last hour, which was pretty exciting and then lost on the final vote.

We bought the Polish version of this game about a year before this English version was released. I must admit I was disappointed by the components and the rule changes to what we were used to. It's basically the same game, but we'll stick with our old copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Having good art doesn't make a game automatically similar to Dixit. They're not. They play Completely differently. 

Dixit offers rich creative freedom, Mysterium doesn't at all. Mysterium is like the voting part of Dixit without the storyteling. And that's okay. But here the similarity ends. 

Mysterium offers a strong cooperative feel, somehow perfectly mixed with the sense of individuality. 
"Yes, we all just won, but... did we? The three of Us voted correctly in the end, not you two! And from us, these two had the highest score on the track so they are the ultimate winners!"
Obviously, all that really matters is that we all won, but the possibility of a victory within victory enriches the game and was implemented so seamlessly.

RATING: 9
This combines many things I like about Dixit in a very different setting. Having only played as a medium, I do wonder whether the enjoyment depends upon the skill/interest of the person playing the ghost. But we had a lot of fun and I'm definitely considering adding this to my collection.

This was discribed as Dixit meets Cluedeo to me and I bought it straight away.
Me and my wife found Dixit fun but without much replayablitiy (especially within the same group)
This game has been played twice with the same group and once with my parents and grandma.

It is simple and easy to pick up, has a sound track (which we added a app store soundboard for the ghost to control) to help create atmospher.  If you have a group that will really get into the theme then great but if not it is still a great shout.
really social game as it's co-op and lots of discusion takes place but under timer conditions so it really does only take about 40mins.

If you didn't like Dixit then you still might like this, Dixit felt unfinished, like half a game.

11/10/2017 - Raising rating because after a year of replays, the aforementioned time lag problem has become less and less of an issue. When I'm the ghost, I no longer have a problem even with the maximum player count. The trick is realizing that there won't be a perfect clue and settling for something that's good enough. I also have gotten quite good at saying, 'no good clue for this person, let's do the other people first' so as to not freeze up. I've noticed that other experienced ghosts play similarly. Also, I've added a little bit of extra spice to the second half of the game by asking people to describe the murder. Overall, this has improved the game a great deal, and has allowed it to stay. Plus, few games are so fantastic for Halloween.

07/25/2016 - Great game with 2-4 players, but when I played with 7, the 'time lag' of the ghost's decision-making becomes considerable and the game moves too slowly. May still work in a large group of friends, but for a typical game night group of people, plays better with less people.

RATING: 6
An overglorified dixit with same flavour and feel, but with a longer setup and waiting times and worse replayablity.

Though I understand why people like it more than dixit (as it is coop instead of comp and most relaxed playgroups don't prefer competitive games)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dixit left me cold, but this game is great. One player (the ghost) tries to refer pictures of persons, places and items with other, more abstract pictures (dreams). Other players, the investigaters try to find out the connections. Engaging, beautiful, original, cooperative and rather fast, at least with 4 players. I read, that it is suggested that with 6-7 players, the group should split into 2 groups which seems to be a reasonable idea. The game components make it possible (unintetionally).

RATING: 7.55
A very unique game, albeit one that potentially suffers from meta-game analysis a little too much.   

The gist of the game is that the "ghost" provides hints to a player about a person/place/object related to a murder through the use of dream cards that, smartly, have the potential to refer to lots of different persons/places/objects.  Over repeated plays, I could see it becoming problematic that a player might know that a particular ghost player always uses color schemes as the defining characteristic of his or her hints, etc.  That said, the limited hand of cards that the ghost player has to work with will at times mitigate even this potential problem.  

With a group of relatively non-serious gamers, I found the regular difficulty level of this game about right.  On all three games, the final round was reached, but not always with the psychics making the correct final guess.

its a fun party game but i feel the long term replay is very limited. After 1-2 plays the players learn strategies to help narrow or rule out certain possibilities. A few more plays and players learn strategies that tend to work better and thus repeated and makes the game play even more repetitive.  The ending only becomes questionable since there is no table discussion at the final round making it more of a shot in the dark.

Dixit with a story! This is great and co op to boot. Loved my first time as a ghost when one player complained I was doing a terrible job. She took the ghost role next and was EVEN WORSE!

[GAMEID=39856] with a purpose.  Thrives and suffers for the same reasons but more so.

Thrives:  Makes you think & draw connections.  Must be flexible and creative.  Not a serious game - play it for fun, for the experience.

Suffers:  Clue cards can be rough at times.  Definitely not for everyone.  Can be frustrating.

I like this one a lot.  It's a great later-in-the-night, non-serious game.  More experiential than anything, but the game elements are tight enough to establish purpose and benchmarks.  Difficulty is scalable (which is AWESOME).  Decent-to-good replay value.  Overall, absolutely perfect for what it's supposed to be.

I strongly suggest you try it and see if it's for you.

RATING: 8
Mysterium is really great and for someone like me, who studies translation and communication, it's also a fascinating experience. You have the information and you're trying to transmit it to the other players without talking... just using pictures. It's very interesting! Mysterium does also everything right to be a good cooperative game: it's tense, it's difficult and it has a very nice theme, but it also doesn't suffer of the aplha-gamer problem, because nobody can be 100% sure about the meaning of the dream cards. 

I also think that Mysterium is one of the best gateway games out there... way better than something like Ticket to Ride or other "classics" for a lot of reasons. It has simple rules and beautiful components like other games, but it also goes up to 7 players, it has the visual impact of Dixit and the basic concept of Clue, that a lot of people already know, and it's cooperative, which allows for a friendlier game-play and it's something completely new for those who only played Monopoly and Risk. I really can't think of any other game that would be better as a gateway experience!

Now the entire game was made even better with the new edition! The new components and arts are wonderful, but I'm particularly happy for the screen, which is what the game needed to flow more smoothly. I also like the changes to the rules, which is something I didn't expect going into the game. I wasn't sure about the hourglass, because I liked to have the possibility of a longer discussion, but it actually brought some tension, which I really enjoyed, and kept the game running at the right speed. Even less sure I felt about the clairvoyance tokens, but I was pleasantly surprised by them. I like how this addition brings new decisions to be made and gives you a sort of consolation prize, when you get your clue wrong but you can go up on the track, because you were right about something else. 

Overall an excellent and beautiful light cooperative game, that can be played with everybody and rarely fails to entertain.

1st plays: The kids absolutely loved this one.  I played some spooky haunted house music, lowered the lights and had them close their eyes while I handed out their "visions" to them.  They got into the theme and insisted we play a 2nd game right away.  My daughter insisted on being the ghost, and I think she did better than me.  The theme of this game really comes through, and the art is great.  An improvement on Dixit in every way.

2nd plays: Worked equally well a second time.  It is by no means a heavy game but it accomplishes what it sets out to do.  The theme is very rich and the excellent production completes the package.  The artwork in the game is well done and fits with the roles and locations.  The weapon cards are bit harder to tie together, as the weapon cards don't have much on them to connect with dream cards.  It seems like an intentional design choice and it forces you to try to solve the weapons in a different way than the other cards.

The game is drop dead gorgeous.  For a game where the mechanics are based on the visuals, this is super important.  The game is really fun as both the ghost and the investigators.

If the ghost is not having fun, I am pretty sure the game would not work at all. This has not happened in any of our plays though.  I would never assign a ghost regularly and make sure it is the role the player wants to play.

Juego cooperativo muy bien presentado y con una ambientación fantástica. Consiste en adivinar el personaje, lugar y el arma con el que se ha cometido un asesinato, deduciendo las pistas de cartas con dibujos abstractos que un juegador conocido como el espíritu nos va entregando.
Jugamos cuatro partidas seguidas en una tarde, y resultó un éxito. 
Puede resultar complicado de lograr el éxito, pero es parte del encanto del juego.
No es caro para la calidad de los componentes y lo que da de sí el juego.

Hits the table often in my group because of sheer simplicity, ease of house-ruling, and nice presentation. I've played a handful of times and the crowd consensus usually means it comes out, but with groups of 2-5 people I prefer other games at this point just for the variety, so score has dropped to a 7. If people play this enough with each other, they will come to associate certain cards well enough that they will be correct much more often.
It may be one of few games that have run its course with me by being played *too much*.

RATING: 5.5
I'm a bit conflicted on this one. I like the idea of using Dixit mechanisms to create a deduction-style game. But it ends up playing out more like a race game, and your ability to move forward really revolves around what cards the ghost was able to pull and how well they are able to indicate what they want you to pick, which would be good, if it was spread over a longer game, so that things can even out. But it's a surprisingly short game and it's probably about half as long as it would need to be to start evening things out.

I think that with a worse production, so that it looked and felt like a small game, this wouldn't bother me. But when you open the box and set everything up, it looks like you're about to start playing Dead of Winter or something. And then it ends up feeling more like you've played a half-round of Codenames. If the table presence felt like Codenames, that might not bother me. But with the overwrought production, it feels like it's all facade and very little game. If I was the one to buy the game, I'd feel a bit cheated. Even as a player, I still felt that way a little bit.

Most importantly, I just don't feel like the game had to be as short as it was. The developers could easily have added more options to search among, or more stages to go through. Or if they wanted it to be a small, tight game to go through a few half-dozen times in a row, they could have pared down the production, streamlined the rules a little bit, so that it was quicker to set up and tear through the game a few times. It's effectively Codenames. It should be as straightforward as Codenames.

Beyond that, there's the element of betting on who is right and who is wrong. This felt awkward. The game feels like it should be a cooperative title, but instead we have to wait until someone has bet to tell them that we think they are wrong. And if they are wrong, and wrong often, then we will have to wait for them to catch up, so that we can finish the game. If they don't then we will all lose to the clock.

I suppose that's one way that a semi-cooperative game works, but it doesn't feel natural, like being a hoarder in Dead of Winter or a traitor in Shadows Over Camelot. It prevents anyone from alpha gaming the other players, I suppose. But, like I said, it didn't feel natural.

The game doesn't suck. But it definitely feels like this isn't the game that it should be.

ETA: It sounds like the original rules for the game did not have the elements that I didn't like. You might try looking them up and giving them a try!

I've played a ton of the original (Ukrainian version) and am happy with the American version as well.  I'll play it pretty much whenever, and it's a damned solid co-op with an interesting twist - though it's a lot harder on the ghost than it is on the players.

Got this as A Christmas present and played a  ton with my parents and sister. While we have defninitely seen all of the dream cards by now and are starting to get some biases, still an excellent game as each ghost player brings a new way of looking at things.

after a few months of cooling, the dream cards are familiar, but the biases are receeding, expansions obviously help too.

I remember hearing about Dixit and liking the concept, however Dixit is obviously better with more players an I usually have only 2 or 3 players these days so it doesn't work.

Πανέμορφο συνεργατικό party game όπου ένας παίκτης αναλαμβάνει τον ρόλο ενός φαντάσματος που προσπαθεί να δώσει στους ντετεκτιβ να καταλάβουν ποιός είναι ο δολοφόνος. Και επειδή σαν φάντασμα δεν μπορεί να μιλήσει, προσπαθεί να επικοινωνήσει μαζί τους μέσω ονείρων. :p

Το φάντασμα λοιπόν μοιράζει κρυφά για κάθε παίκτη ένα δολοφόνο μια τοποθεσία και ένα όπλο. Όλες αυτές τις πληροφορίες τις κρατάει κρυφές πίσω από μια οθόνη. Κάθε γύρα δίνει σε κάθε παίκτη μια ή και παραπάνω κάρτες-ονειρα (σκεφτείτε ζωγραφιές στυλ dixit) και ο κάθε παίκτης προσπαθεί να βρει τον δολοφόνο που ανατέθηκε σε αυτόν ανάμεσα σε όλους τους υποπτους στο τραπέζι. Αν το βρει μετά προχωρά στη στην τοποθεσία και μετά στο όπλο. Μέσα σε 7 γύρους το πολύ πρέπει όλοι να τα βρούν όλα αλλιώς χάνουν. 

Υπάρχει και η τελική φάση όπου το φάντασμα διαλέγει κρυφά ποιανού παίκτη ο δολοφόνος είναι τελικά ο σωστός δολοφόνος και προσπαθεί με 3 κάρτες όνειρα να δώσει στους παίκτες να το καταλάβουν. Σε αυτή τη φάση η κάθε μια από τις 3 κάρτες δίνει στοιχείο για το πρόσωπο την τοποθεσία και το όπλο αλλά οι ντετεκτιβ δεν ξέρουν ποια κάρτα δείχνει τι. Οπότε το συζητάν και καταλήγουν όλοι μαζί κάπου και είτε κερδίζουν είτε χάνουν.   
     
Υπάρχουν και advanced κανόνες με τον κάθε παίκτη να μαζεύει VP ποντάροντας αν ο συμπαίκτης του κάνει λάθος ή σωστά αλλά τους βρίσκω πραγματικά ανούσιους και είναι εύκολο να τους κάνεις game. Κάτι σκηνικά του στιλ «παιδιά θα βάλω αυτή την λάθος απάντηση ώστε να ποντάρετε όλοι στο λάθος μου και να πάρετε VP» τα βρίσκω κόντρα στο πνεύμα του παιχνιδιού. :shake:

This game utterly retired Dixit for me. As much as I will always enjoy Dixit as a social activity, this is the same idea in a GAME. My only issue with it is that the dream cards get very familiar very quickly, but fortunately I have hundreds of Dixit cards I can use instead. Even though the theme is a little week, ironically it does come through in trying to figure what the hell another player is trying to tell you via art work.

I played only once, ended up being the ghost to a group in which we didn't know each other. It was pretty exhausting and I must admit hasn't left me with fond memories.

Still, it is an interesting game for a large group and is super easy to introduce people to board games since the players don't need to know much, the ghost will handle it all.

Dixit meets Clue. Played one round in Essen, enjoyed the deduction aspects, graphics and mind games. The final round felt a bit tacked on its suspense forced, but it did not diminish the fun we had with the majority of the game.

Mysterium was a hit around the holidays with the extended family. Good for higher play counts of 5-7 players. It is quite easy to teach the basics of the game and dive into playing. 

For a couple of items holding this back from a higher rating: the rule book seems badly organized (we didn't get all the rules correct in our first couple of plays, mainly due to people wanting the game to keep moving and no one being completely familiar with some of the rule minutiae); and "winning" the game lacks a little pop (similar to Clue, it just ends on the reveal.

Edit, March 2017: Junk Art is the new party game for me, and I prefer other "gateway" weight games over this. 

Edit: May 2017: This is a keeper and will get played at play counts of 5-7. It's a good game. I look forward to seeing if the new expansion fixes my issues with the end game.

Absolutely delightful mashup of Clue and Dixit. I haven't played this with only two, but every other player count has been an amazing time. Every time this hits the table, I want to play it multiple times.

The only potential downside is that it requires a group with some ability to be imaginative, but not necessarily creative (except the Ghost player).

This game relies on free association with randomly dealt cards, making detective work into totally random guesswork. I  don't see what the cards have to do with the murder case. Sure, I can make up a story but how is that ever going to match with what the game leader has in mind? In my case, it never does. The cards are too generic, allowing for way too many interpretations.

My wife likes this game, and I have had plenty of people say they have enjoyed it. The problem I have with it is that the hint cards are just so busy. The artwork is great, but it is difficult to come up with useful hints. Being the ghost is stressful instead of fun. I don't like this game. Also, the final stage and the rest of the game feel very disconnected to me. In the end, if the ghost doesn't have any cards that help create meaningful hints, all the work of getting there feels completely worthless.

Really fun deduction co-op game that uses incredible artwork (a la Dixit) on its cards to solve a mystery. I was the ghost in our game and had so much fun. It is incredibly difficult to get people to understand what you're going for when you give out the cards, but that's what makes the game so fun. Next game, I want to be a normal player and see how that side works.

RATING: 9
Amazingly fun game that combines Clue and Dixit, to be brief. Players must each find a combination of elements for a potential murder- weapon, location, person. The twist is the players are mediums communing with a ghost- a role taken on by a player who must remain silent. There only tool are cards depicting dreamy images. A unique, interestingly challenging co-op with fantastic art and a well implemented them. Checks MANY boxes.

Una mezcla de clue y dixit. De hecho se pueden usar las cartas de Dixit en este juego y viceversa. Los componentes son de alta calidad y algunas de las cartas tienen un arte tan llamativo que me dan ganas de tener un cuadro con esa imagen en mi casa. Se podría decir que el jugador que hace de fantasma juega un juego aparte y esto puede gustar o desagradar. En lo particular me gusta tanto ser fantasma como ser investigador.

I remember playing the first Polish iteration of this game a few years ago at the Dice Tower Con and leaving with a feeling of "meh" after my play. Maybe it was the poor rules explanation leaving my co-players and I bewildered or the tiredness of a late night of a con, but having played the new version, Mysterium, the game went up a few notches in the totem pole. 

Don't get me wrong, these social experiment games are not really in my wheelhouse, but playing with the right group and understanding the rules fully made a big difference in my opinion of the game. 

Each player is trying to decipher a who, where and with what murder in order to get to the final whodunit. All of the players must find their objectives because, if not, everyone loses. The way the clues are given is via cards with different pictures, abstractions and paintings. They are given by a Ghost via his dreams who is trying to find who murdered him. Sometimes, the clues given do not make sense since the Ghost is limited to seven cards per clue and has to make the best choice among them. This makes for hilarious and fun times as well as interesting deduction moments. Because of certain rules in the game, the cooperation element is not really hindered by an alpha player like some other co-ops.

The production values are very good and the art on the cards is top notch. I wish the insert would fit sleeved cards... I'm glad to have this title in my repertoire since it scratches an itch not provided by the multitude of heavier Euro games in my collection.

A unique concept. The ghost plays cards that the players need to interpret in order to figure out the culprit, place, and weapon. It has the idea of Clue but takes it in a completely different direction! Mysterium is cooperative but the ghost can only use the concept cards to communicate while the psychics have to play the good ol' guessing game with each others help. Find the Mysterium soundtrack on Youtube to give it some extra flavor!

This is a fairly fun game that is quite unique. I didn't find it amazingly exciting and I don't think I would want to own a copy, but I could see this being a lot of fun as a casual game with friends and family. My wife enjoyed the visual aspect more than Codenames, and I think I would agree.

Fun game, but potentially limited replay-ability. Has suggested modes to play: Easy, medium, and hard. With people I play with a lot, we fly through medium difficulty, as we are used to each other and the clues we give. Fun game, though, and will always be one on the shelf ready to go.

More fun than dixit and clue. Good for a lightly thematic small party game that have a little more strategy than most common party games. American version hasn't quite lived up to the hype in my opinion, but I'm still glad I was able to get a hold of it.

I love pretty much everything about this game. I love the idea behind it, the theme that's all over it, the mechanism of trying to obtain answers through interrogating obscure and often tangential imagery... it's a blast. It's also really, really difficult to play as the ghost, as the chances of getting cards that work for you seem to be pretty remote. I still love it to bits though.

Very successful with the kids, even Jessica (7). I don't bother with the newer voting rules and "intuition tokens". We just do the reconstruction of events and them attempt to identify the final culprit. Sorting the cards is a bit of a pain. Being the ghost can be quite pressured but we hand to play five times in a row so everyone could take a turn as ghost. Definitely a top family game.

*Disclaimer: The listed rating/10 is heavily weighted towards my enjoyment of the game and the experience that it provides. Each pro and con are factored individually towards a cumulative score, but do not have fixed increments in which they can detract or increase a rating.

Pros:

Mysterium needs the right context and relies a little too much on the vibe and the bling factor of the components. There is a small game and fun game here, but just playing the game mechanically is lacklustre. The player playing as the ghost has a much better time with this game in my experience, and sometimes playing as a psychic can feel like you are passive and/or watching someone else play an engaging complex game.

Dixit and Clue's illegitimate child. This one was a blast to play. The art is beautiful and the gameplay is quick and intuitive.

Surprisingly, this game lived up to the hype! I had been looking forward to it for over a year and it did not disappoint.

The US version is fantastic. I was worried that it would be changed too much and while I would have liked the original person/place/item artwork better, the ghost screen and crystal balls make the US version the one I'm glad I own.

Mysterium does not kill Dixit for me however. I think they are both great games and will happily keep both (and maybe even use cards as cross-expansions in the future).

While I have never played with the Clairvoyance track/end game, everyone I have played with has agreed that it seems like it would be a terrible addition to a fantastic cooperative game.

I much prefered Dixit. The components in this game give the impression of an objective goal, but really it is a very loose party game. Playing as the ghost was ridiculously frustrating. While I would play again, only as a psychic and I would much rather play Dixit or Letters from Whitechapel for that deductive itch.

Always a huge favorite.  I bought the expansion and then for more cards for the ghost to hand out I printed out a bunch of abstract artwork and chopped them down into card size.  We were running into the problem where we played it often enough that people had more or less labeled some of the recurring artwork cards as "this always means this..." and it was making it a bit stale as well as people would not look at other options it could be used for.

Whilst many people praise the game for being Dixit "with a point", I personally find this actually makes Mysterium slightly too easy and significantly reduces its replayability. Whilst Dixit offers players the opportunity to find new and creative ways to play the same cards repeatedly, in Mysterium (after only five plays) playing the clue cards had already become entirely scripted within our group - i.e. specific cards had already come to represent specific people, rooms or weapons, meaning there was little choice for all the player. Very much enjoyed playing my first couple of games of this one, but it certainly wasn't the Dixit killer I expected. Rating reduced from 7.5 due to its limited replayability.

I liked the idea of Dixit where you try to match rather "abstract" pictures to whatever you are trying to say. But doing this only to get points and to be the one with the most? Meh... isn't there something the same but different? Something with a twist?

Then somewhere somewhen Tajemnicze Domostwo showed up and sounded awesome. Although it was just in Polish I thought about getting it until I heard that it will be reprinted as Mysterium.

It is exactly what I expected and even more. This game is so much fun for either side. Trying to match the suspects to the dream-cards or the other way round while the psycists are guessing everything wrong. Even loosing is fun since you get to see the different aspects everybody was looking at.

I love it. A super cool party game.

Spoooky ghosts, or at least someone gets to play one in Mysterium. I've had this game sitting unplayed on a shelf for a long time and I'm not really sure why. Great components, good artwork and relatively light and fun game play. This game checks off pretty much everything I'm looking for in a game. I'm really looking forward to trying this one again. On a side not a friend of mine taught this game to me as they play it often in another group. Apparently they never really read the entire rulebook and were missing part of the game...

This is a solid game and a big hit over the holidays.  I played with my family and they loved this game.  Yes, it is Dixit meets Clue.  The production of the components is top notch.  They have card board clock to track roads.....very evocative and immersive.  The psychic figures are crystal balls which are awesome. There is a lot of attention to detail here.  I like the cartoony art personally.  It does not take away from the immersion for me that someone is a disembodied ghost and others are trying to catch a murderer.  I highly recommend this game if you liked Dixit.  This is not a Dixit killer.  It is a different game than Dixit.  My only complaint is that there are not a lot of murder weapon cards and I think after several plays the game will need an expansion. There are a lot of vision cards but again after repeated plays you will need an expansion.  Plenty of game in the box but if you play it a lot you will enjoy an expansion. Wait...one more complaint, there is one component (a extremely small token) to determine how "clairvoyant" a player is.  These tokens are entirely waaaaay too small and can be lost very easy.

I cannot say enough good things about this game so I'll just hit a few points.  One, if you like "Clue" (or think you do) throw it away and buy this.  If you like Dixit (or want to) but think it's missing something, like a point, go buy this.  It is difficult to explain how fun this game is, it really needs to be played/experienced.  I while it plays best with 5 I would argue the more the merrier.  This got played three times (1 win) the first night it hit the table (well past bedtime on a school night, bad daddy!) everyone wanted a turn as the ghost and at the end even the toddlers were in on it.  This is a game everyone wants to play, is there higher praise?

RATING: 8
Really fun mix of Dixit and Clue. Players have to determine the murderer, location, and weapon based on abstract "vision" cards given by one player. Obviously the art is the shining star here as everything in the game looks fantastic. The game is definitely best with a higher player count (5-7 would be ideal) as everybody can interact and discuss the meaning of each vision. Playing as the ghost is also quite interesting but can be difficult since you're not allowed to talk. Very easy game to learn and a lot of fun with a sizeable group of people.

I don't know how I feel about this game. It's definitely the feeling of Dixit mixed with Cleudo, but it still feels like less then Cleudo, and certainly less than Dixit. There's a great game in there somewhere but it has so many limitations about what to discuss and when to discuss and jenky rules about putting down tokens and how to vote that I was bored.... and by the end of the game we had zero discussion that explained what the ghost was thinking therefore had no idea why our trial and error had hit or missed. With Dixit you know every turn what the story was alluding to at least...

I'll play this game but am dumbfounded by the absolute love that is banded about four this game. 

I am still not feeling this game. It doesn't feel like a cooperative game, it doesn't feel like it's just an "experience" game, it doesn't feel like the fun I have with Dixit. It doesn't even feel like a game. It fails on so many levels.

Más que nada soy fanático de los juegos de estrategia pero este me parece un muy buen juego familiar. Es como una versión un poco más compleja de Dixit en el que hay que relacionar unas cartas con las que nos da el jugador que es el fantasma. Lo mejor es que es un juego cooperativo así que al final ganan o pierden todos juntos, aunque hay una pequeña recompensa a los que les va mejor en el transcurso de la partida.

I can't remember the last time I was so hyped for a game. I'm so happy this didn't disappoint! Basically what I'll say is that if you read the description and the game sounds fun to you, you're probably going to love it. It's just so clever and beautiful, I'm impressed on nearly every level.

It's funny that it ended up coming out so soon after Codenames in the U.S. - as a result every group I introduce this to immediately latches onto the "visual Codenames" description.

It's not a perfect game - it's true that the endgame can feel somewhat disconnected from the early game, but it's so much fun I'm really not bothered. Plus, if you're clever the early game really can make the difference as you build up a visual language for your clues.

So I accidentally played with the Ukranian rules first - as the 2 and 3p games are essentially those, and then when we first had a fourth person join at the end of a long night, we just stuck to those.

Finally got to try with the English rules though and I do like them, even if it feels a bit unnecessary. I kind of wish they were presented as the 'advanced rules' or something, just because I can definitely foresee myself playing by the Ukranian rules in certain situations still. But I think we will default to the English rules. The clairvoyance track rewards you for doing well in the early game, which makes the end game feel a bit more connected.

And even though it definitely feels arbitrary, doing the silent vote at the end is exciting. Getting to talk it all out with your friends as per the Ukranian rules is obviously enjoyable too, though.

The only true downside here is that it's a very content-driven game, so it doesn't take long to start seeing all the same stuff. Not the end of the world, but expansions will help give us the long tail here.

Generates a lot of fun discussion between the players, in a way that Dixit never really accomplished when I played. There are a lot of fun misunderstandings from the ghost to the players. 

It is a little bit rules-heavy and fiddly for casual players, which limits this for me, but there are a couple of situations where it works. 

There are only 18 cards of each type. That is SEVERELY limiting. The dream cards - you could use Dixit cards to add to those. But the actual person/location/weapon cards are the issue. Played twice and already saw many duplicates, which allows visual cues and language to persist over games - for this game that is a huge downside, and is actually enough to turn this from an instant purchase to a no for me.

Also: don't pick a ghost who can't stop themselves giving non-verbal clues such as sighs, eye rolling, head-banging and other gestures.

User dbradhud makes being the ghost look easy.  I'm usually pretty good at clue-giving, but I found out that it is NOT easy.  It took four turns to get any of my family members past the suspect stage.  Ouch.

On the other hand, when I was the ghost with other people, I had no trouble getting them pointed in the right direction (not that it was easy, per se).  So I guess that just means I can't communicate with my family.

Oh, loads of fun here! Very similar to Dixit in the way of forcing meaning from artwork. Challenging to find symbolism in the cards and hope the player recipients can see the same symbology rather than focusing on something else. I'm certain these kinks grow out (and possibly grow tiresome) as the players memorize the card images. Also challenging to teach the game to new players while also playing the ghost at the same time.. this game definitely benefits from having at least two experienced players, one to be ghost and another to explain and maintain the board bits. In the end, absolutely worth it.

Start by ignoring the stupid semi-coop betting rules. Play the game as a pure co-op the way it was designed. The group interactions that this game inspires are amazing. Couple that with THE BEST artwork of any game currently in print. This game is spectacular. With a good ghost it's a "10".

RATING: 7.5
Great game that suffers from minor faults, in my mind. Very easy to learn, incredible art, and fun theme. I think several of the cardboard components are unnecessary and could be left out or simplified; they only serve to make setup slower or, in the case of the tiny clairvoyance track markers, become lost... Overall, the greatest flaw of this game is the pacing, which scales to the number of players. Each turn, the ghost works through their vision cards for each player, during which time everyone else just sits around waiting. By contrast, the other players end up having a much faster, simultaneous turn. With 7 people playing, this game ends up being really boring for some people who need to stay engaged. At 4 people, the game proceeds relatively quickly. I think that there should be a way to force the ghost to pick cards faster, say 30 secs or 1 minute per player to dish out all vision cards.

This game is both very hard and very easy.  It is great just for the table discussion it brings.  I think you need to modify the ending phase a bit, I've heard every translation changes it up a bit and I want to find one that makes a bit more sense.  Still it is quite fun and extremely accessible.

Although I really like the theme and thought interesting gameplay at first glance, I was really disappointed after the first few games. Either you can get or deal an obvious vision-card and the spiritist has no challenge at all, or the game turns into a pure guessing contest in which you can pinpoint down the solution after a few rounds while the other player have to wait and the chance to solve the murder is getting worse. Kind of I spy with my little eye version with beautiful cards. Either way, it makes almost no fun at all.  This game doesn't work for me.

You can still have a vote, just make it so those who vote right, win; the others lose; and if the majority vote correctly the ghost also wins.

I am not a fan of party games or deduction games, so "Mysterium" would seem to be D.O.A. for me. However, this is one of the better party deduction games I've played. What I like about it is how the investigators are encouraged to help one another, sharing ideas and nudging their compatriots toward the correct answers. That's great for someone like me who ALWAYS gets the deduction wrong. I would never choose to play "Mysterium" on my own, but I at least wouldn't object to playing it at all.

A really really interesting mechanic, and a LOT of fun.  Setup seems a bit... overdone.  They went all in on tokens and many of them seem superfluous, but once up and running this is a totally unique game where the same image never means the same thing twice.  The conclusion when it comes to finding out the murderer of the final three feels a bit awkward at times where all of the wonderful deduction you've done thus far still leads to a difficult challenge, but getting there is always a lot of fun and anytime I've introduced this game to new players - they adore it.

Asymetric game where one player is a Ghost trying to get everyone else to figure out which of the suspects on cards killed him--he does this by giving out "dream" cards with cool weird art, and the players have to interpret the "dreams" for the images and how they tie to the suspect the ghost is trying to make them guess.

The artwork is very pretty and I love the idea of the game. However, it seems like it is mostly random guessing. Humans are good at finding patterns where there are none, so I expect that a good number of people will claim that they knew what clue the ghost was giving them. But, I haven't seen any ghost or investigator consistently perform above average across games. It makes a nice party game though, and creates an enjoyable atmosphere.

I got to play this for the first time tonight and I really enjoyed it. I only was able to play with one other person but it was still a great experience. Sometimes the coop games don't work well with two people when they're geared for more but this one does very well. I loved the difficulty of trying to convey what I was seeing on the cards as a ghost to the psychic and hearing how they were viewing the cards in front of them. All around this is a great game. I would suggest it to groups that know each other well so they knew what to pick up on with the different cards.

Probably not fair of me to rate this, as clearly I am not the target audience, but I played it, so I'm rating it. It looks nice, but (a) it's a co-op, and (b) it's glorified Dixit.

Mysterium aka "Dixit - The Game" adds meaning and agency to the "ambigous pretty cards" mechanic popularized by Dixit. The theme lends itself well to light roll-playing (I'd advice some spooky moaning and floating around the table as the ghost) and atmosphere and the cooperative deduction approach of mysterium works just as well as Dixit's match-the-clue mechanic. The ability/need to guide players to certain cards over multiple rounds keeps everyone engaged and enables some light deduction. Pace is highly dependend on the ghost, who's task is decidedly more sophisticated  than those of the other players. As with all "restricted communication" games, groups need to figure out what flies with them and what doesn't, adding another layer of possible difficulty adjustment.

This game seems to pull from several other games out there - a solid dose of Dixit, a bit of Codenames, and a bit of Clue. It's wrapped up in a very shiny package with beautiful components.

While I don't think it's an amazing game, it's pretty fast to play and if you don't take it too seriously, it can  be a fun time. While I'm going to always reach for Codenames when I want a clue-giving game, this will be nice to play once in awhile.

Components: Gorgeous artwork, especialy on the character and location cards, and the ghost screen. The ghost cards are very Dixit-like; so much so that I think the Dixit cards could be used to expand this game.

Experience: As a ghost, very interesting. The cards are very limited, and send really ambiguous messages, so it's fun to try to play these wisely, and then see how they are interpreted.

Seems like it would be really tough to get high on the clairvoyance track. In our first game, noone made it past the first section, and so everyone had to guess the identity based on a singled revealed card.

The ghost is at a bit of a disadvantage if only looking at the cards behind the screen, as the clues might be better matches for the dummy suspect/location/weapon cards out on the table.

Another tough one to rate. Has similar issues as Codenames: (1) playing as the ghost is an order-of-magnitude more enjoyable than as a guesser (way more so than in Codenames - and the game is too long to switch up the clue-giver role in B2B games), and (2) gameplay can be spoiled with tells (although this is nowhere near as bad as in Codenames. 

I was tempted to round this up to a Thumbs Up as, even though I find the game lame, it brings the group together thru exchange of ideas, cheers, and groans.  But I'm going with the Thumbs Down as I think replayability within the same group will be a huge problem; I generally don't let replayability affect my rating, but it's just enough to knock me on the dark side of the fence.

Vous aimez DIXIT ? Vous aimez les enquêtes style CLUEDO ? Vous allez adorer Mysterium ! Vous êtes de vrais médiums. Et vous devez retrouver les éléments d'un meurtre. Est-ce le colonel Moutarde qui a commis le meurtre dans le petit salon avec un chandelier ? Hummmm ... Pour cela, le fantôme va vous aider : "Toc toc, Fantôme, es-tu là ?" Mais comme il ne peut pas parler (c'est un fantôme), il va vous envoyer des visions sous forme d'images : "Je vois...je vois .... un bateau dans une baignoire ...". Est-ce que cela veut dire que le meurtre a eu lieu dans une fontaine ? ou dans un endroit clos ? Mystèèèèrreeeee !  Mysterium est un jeu coopératif ! Tous ensemble pour comprendre les visions du fantôme. Il faudra bien ça ! Une ambiance de jeu sombre (mais pas oppressante), un jeu très bien illustré, saurez-vous lire à travers les images ? (Dans la boîte, il ne manque que la cape pour celui qui joue le fantôme... dommage :) )

A friend once described it to me as "spooky Dixit", which I found pretty apt. 

When I first played Mysterium, I did not enjoy it much, finding it sort of frustrating. This, fortunately, turned out to be because I was playing it with the wrong crowd. When I played again with players who were keenly invested in who the murderer could be and understood that you're supposed to be working as a team, Mysterium leaped up the ranks for me.

I have only managed to win Mysterium once - it is a tough game even when everyone is working together, Nonetheless, I have enjoyed it almost every time I have played. There's a lot of fun in trying to puzzle out the images provided by the ghost (OR, as the ghost, desperately trying to get people back on track as they stubbornly cling to the one aspect of the picture you didn't consider). The time limit can be stressful, but in a way that encourages cooperation. Overall, it's a fun, unique little game that I don't think everyone will like, but those who do like it will love it.

RATING: 6.7
One player takes on the role of a ghost of someone who has been killed, and tries to give clues to the other players in order for them to figure out who, where and with what object he was killed. In stage 1 all players have to find their own suspect, place and object. If all have succeeded in doing so after 7 rounds max, then stage 2 can start. All players can then vote for one of the suspects, after they have received some extra clues (at least if they were able to earn these extra clues during stage 1 by voting on the correct nature of the other players' choices as they were trying to figure out who, where and by which means their suspect alledgedly did it).

Have played once, and enjoyed it, but there was far too much downtime since we weren't allowed to look at clues until all had been given out. I'm pretty sure that's wrong, and that we should see clues immediately, starting the timer only when the last clue is given out.

Second play was as the ghost. It's *really* hard !

Migbt be better with an agreement not to give clue cards based on similar colors. As it is you don't know if you're looking for sophisticated, clever connections or 'it's mostly green'.

No one seemed particularly satisfied, but everyone wanted to play again. If the game does develop a sense of agency, if it really is possible to communicate through the cards, it could be pretty great. But there was little sign of that tonight.

Another of the new crop of fresh, innovative games. Players have a limited number of guesses at clue-like murder (culprit, weapon, & location). 

But the clue-giver can use only a deck of cards with dream-like images to give the clues to the psychic investigators.

The challenge is in trying to read into the images for the intention of the clue-giver. What pictures on this card associate with the suspects and locations?

Probably my favorite game for non-board gamers. A game of deduction (and funky deduction at that), you have one player as the ghost giving very abstract clues to the other players to determine who killed them, where, and with what. The more "clairvoyant" you are at picking up on the ghost's clues, the better at the end. However the game is mostly cooperative.

It's a game that doesn't require much board game strategy to know how to play, what's most important is knowing what kind of person the ghost is, and how they think (though often they get screwed over with bad cards to give out). It does take a little while to setup, but of all the people I've played with, ~15 now, only one person has it really backfired on since they just didn't care.

Pitched as a cooperative version of Dixit, it honestly only feels like a game for the one person playing the ghost and the rest of us are just “audience members” reacting to clues. Its an enjoyable experience. I’ve never played ‘the ghost’ and honestly, after looking at all the preparation and rules consultation they do, don’t really have any desire to; it seems like a lot of effort for such little return. I still prefer Dixit a lot more to this game because in Dixit you are an acting participant (each and every person), yet here (unless you are the ‘ghost’) we are just re-acting to what is presented to us. Still its and enjoyable experience; its like watching someone put on a magic show they prepared for you. It’s entertaining.

Played 3 player, so I haven't tried the clairvoyance tokens yet. It's fun to choose cards creatively as the ghost, and fun to discuss and choose as a psychic. It's entertaining and helpful as the ghost to listen to the psychics work out the clues. The last phase of the game successfully maintains suspense until the final moment. Minuses include fiddliness, downtime alternating between ghost and psychics, and lack of social interaction for the ghost.

In concept: 
Dixit + Cluedo

In result: 
- Co-op game with one player playing alone and not speaking with group.
- No real deduction and too few dixit-like cards (all used in first game, some more than once).
- Above that 90% of the game seems to be just preparation (and easy one) for last guess which has no real clues, but is easy to trick.

Very cool game! Interesting dynamic in that the ghost is giving the mediums vision cards that match how the murder was committed. Comparing this to Dixit, it’s actually better because it removes the randomness aspect of who knows what pop culture or literary reference. In Mysterium, the mediums have to consider the relationship between the vision card and the suspect cards, thus how the ghost operates is confined to the cards.  Excellent game!

A very unique game about using visual clues to identify with a ghost's direction to the cause of their death. Players work together to interpret clue cards (similar to Dixit) and work out the intended message. There's a final round where all players interpret one final string of clue cards to win the game. It's all one player versus the rest, so it might hinge on the ghost player.

2016-02-06 : A game where the design intention clearly was to take a witty, quick-playing great game like Dixit and turn it into something less good. For starters : in Dixit you both are the clue giver and taker at various parts of the game, and that's fun. Clearly too much fun, so cut-out half of that experience. In Dixit there's very little downtime, and when there is some, you use it to come up with clever clues. Here the game is nothing but downtime waiting for the one GM to come-up with clues for everyone. In Dixit the most clever player wins. Can't have that, let's make it so that no matter how well you played this game, if in the end somebody else doesn't pick up on a clue, you lose. And in a 7-player game that's almost inevitable. This is simply a very badly designed totally over-hyped boring game

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Please note: despite there being English rules included with this edition of the game my comments are based on  the (I think) Ukrainian rules where the end game is trying to determine a person, place, and thing with exactly 3 clues. I do not play with this edition's bidding on people's guesses, the timer, and non-cooperative end game.

Lots of people have said this is co-op Clue meets Dixit. I would completely agree with this. Each round the ghost player silently gives Dixit-esque cards  to the other players. The players try to figure out which is their person/place/thing based on the strange card they've been given. Once they've figured out one of these, you move onto the next category. If all players get all of their people/places/things within a specified number of turns, there will be a final collective guess for which set among all of the players sets is actual circumstance of the ghosts murder based on exactly three dream cards the ghost provides as clues. This is extremely fun and is a great rules-light game that can be used as a gateway game. 

Gamers seem to like it a bit more than Dixit. I think many consider this to be a Dixit killer. I don't really agree, since they are pretty different (one is co-op and the other is competitive). I also think it's worthwhile to own both. I say this because the dream cards are so much like Dixit cards, I've used them in a game of Dixit and it worked well. I'm not sure if you could used Dixit cards as dream cards for Mysterium, but it might work. For me, the main reason one doesn't replace the other is that I like Dixit with 6+ players. With Mysterium, I'd rather play this with 3 - 5 players maximum. Why? The more players you play with, the more people/places/things are on display, making it harder to win. In addition, and probably more importantly, the more people you include, the longer it will take for the Ghost player to distribute dream cards and the more likely you are of going through the deck of dream cards (or seeing them more often making the game less replayable).

Regardless of what edition's rules you use, if someone is stuck on a person/place/thing, it can become apparent by round 6, that there is no chance of being able to do the Oneiromancy round. I think this takes away from the narrative arc of the game and is a bit anticlimactic.

The game probably gets kudos for being the first in some genre, but at the point I finally had a chance to play the game there was nothing here I haven't experienced in other "guessing" party games. The artwork is top notch, the ghost screen is a very functional touch, and the sceance theme is a great fit. I do think the game tries to add too many fiddly rules which can complicate the game for some audiences, and in truth I believe takes away from the core fun inside (matching your Dixit art cards to the guesswork of the ghost player).

Two small design quibbles: why the decision to use a numbering system at the end of the game to reference the players, it would of made far more sense to simply use the player's color on the back of the voting tokens, and why were the weapon cards a different size?

A Dixit killing machine. This takes one of my family's favorite party games (the aforementioned Dixit) and transforms it into an actual game. With essentially two games in one box (Ghost & Psychic) that feel surprisingly different, and varying difficulties, this is a great addition to any collection. Watching the psychics completely misconstrue your message is delightfully frustrating, and adapting to their train of thought is challenging and satisfying. The opposites are true when playing as a psychic. Its got more game than Dixit, and is more ambiguous than Codenames, making it a must own for the friendly cooperative gamer.

In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologist, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary séance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.

Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.

In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.

Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.

After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.

If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.

Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards — one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon — then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.

If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully. If not, well, perhaps you can try again...

This is like a cooperative game of Cluedo with Dixit-style cards being used as the clues. The rule book could have been simplified. Scales to 7 players and so far my kids have really enjoyed this one even though we don't often successfully identified the culprit.

RATING: 7
I'm surprised at how much I enjoy this one but I've been charmed by it so far. We play where the psychic is not allowed to show his/her card to the other players but rather must interpret it verbally to them. If they fail the first guess, then they may reveal their card for more help; works really well.

I like the bidding mechanism only because it gives the psychic players something else to do on their turn and keeps them even more engaged with other players' guesses.

After some rough first games, we've been winning lately so I wonder if it's getting too easy for us and we need to go from medium to hard mode. I'm also feeling like I'm ready for more dream cards. 

Dixit feels like more of a game and this is more of a group activity, but I still enjoy it. Only time will tell if the charm still holds up or if there isn't enough game to hold my interest.

RATING: 8.75
I love, love, love:
- the artwork
- the cooperative nature of interpreting each others' wild and vivid dreams
- the eruption of discussion that happens at the end of every game
- the agony of trying to understand a very confused ghost
- the agony of being the very confused ghost

I dislike:
- the timer, so we don't play with it
- that the game's finale seems sorta lacking in impact

Final verdict: It's Clue but prettier and funner! The only big drawback is that the finale is not as gripping as the rest of the game. With our usual two-psychic game on Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty, you're often using one dream card to decide between 4-6 possibilities each (suspects, locations, and items); at the end of the game, though, you're using 1-3 cards to decide between just two options, and this is true regardless of the number of players--that the finale gives you much better chances at guessing correctly.

BUY MYSTERIUM.

Played Mysterium 12+ times.

My favorite big group game.

Why?
1. Everyone is on a team and gets to help each other out.
2. Non-board gamers love it. You don't have to be strategic to do well. You don't have to be smart. You don't have to be a quick thinker. It's perfect for everyone.
3. Since it's entirely co-op there is no fighting. (Which happens in the regular Dixit game, sadly)
4. Beautiful artwork that everyone gets to study and ponder.

After my first game night with it, I went to my game store and bought Dixit cards to match with it. Not all Dixit will work well with the game. I looked at all of them and bought Dixit: Memories and Dixit: Quest. This added 168 new "vision" cards and were only $20 each. This was a better solution for me than getting the actual expansion, Hidden Signs, which only comes with 42 vision cards. HOWEVER, I WILL be buying the expansion as well because I want the 12 new character, location, and object cards. I hear it makes the game harder (which is what I want). I love having a difficult time knowing who you are... "Am I the cop, the hunter, or the war general!!!? I don't know. They all have guns and I got a sheep holding a gun!" That's the best.

If you're hyper competitive, an alpha gamer, and a huge Euro game fan, this one is not for you. People still make silly deductions. People can be stubborn, "But Grandpa, you're definitely this location." Grandpa puts his vote on another location. Nope. "Grandpa, look, you see that in the picture? I think that's pointing to this location." Grandpa still puts it on another location. Nope. Then he finally puts it on the one you suggested. Yep. 

But hey, whatcha gonna do? It's his turn. He can lose us the game if he wants to (which he did) BUT guess what, I just made a quick managerial decision and added another 2 turns to the game. They were happy. I was happy. Make the game fun for your friends.

Best way to play the game is with the Ghost not speaking. Knock twice for yes, once for no, or vice versa. 

Set up takes a while, but it can be expedited if you delegate.
- Have one person pick out the # of character cards they want then match those cards with the Ghosts cards (And do this for the locations and weapons)
- You set up the other contents while they get the cards.

I cut out some cardboard pieces and added some buttons, expanding the game to be played by 11 people total (including ghost). 

Another huge thing that I do differently than the rules suggest, is that I give ONLY 1 card to each player each round. My understanding from the rule book is that you can give as many cards as you want to a person in a single round. This would be far too easy. But hey, if the game is too hard, make the necessary changes for you to enjoy it.

Buy this game. Then buy Dixit: Memories and Dixit: Quest. Then buy Mysterium: Hidden Signs.

RATING: 5
Elkerülhetetlen a Dixittel való összehasonlítás; míg a Dixitben szabadon szárnyalhat a fantázia, itt 7 kézben tartott kártya keretei közé van szorítva. Eddigi tapasztalat, hogy mindenki szellem szeretne lenni. Én nem. Túlságosan nehéz kiválasztani a kiosztandó kártyákat, esetemben AP veszélyes a dolog. És nagyon véletlenszerű, semmint végig gondolt tudatos döntés.
A játék mindenesetre szemet gyönyörködtető! Kapunk „anyagot” a pénzünkért. Jelölők, kártyák, kellékek, tokenek mind-mind az élvezeti faktort hivatottak növelni, sikerrel. Az elődjéhez képesti újítások ötletesek, mint pl a homokóra, ami hasznos a játékidő kordában tartásában. De a legérdekesebb újítás a látnoki képességsáv- és jelölők, amivel megtippelhetjük, hogy a többi médium helyesen szavazott-e a saját kártyájára, és ennek függvényében szavazunk majd a legvégén a végső közös látomásban. Tehát mindenképpen szebb és jobb, mint a Tajemnicze Domostwo, de…
De mégsem élvezetes annyira, amennyire lehetne! Ez egy partijáték, de túl időigényes az előkészület. A játékszabály részletes, talán túlságosan is szájbarágós.
igazán akartam szeretni ezt a játékot, de csak feltételesen sikerült. Érzem az igyekezetet a készítők részéről, hogy próbálták hangulatilag maximalizálni, de kissé erőltetettnek érzem az eredményt. Túl sok negatív dolog jött ki belőlem, pedig annyira azért nem rossz játék, csak nálam valahogy a negatív oldala domborodott ki a hangulata helyett, sajnos. Biztosan elő fog még kerülni, de félő nem olyan gyakran, mint kellene.

RATING: 8.65
Fantastic cooperative deduction game. The expansion for this was greatly needed and appreciated. Mysterium is such a great game, but we found it did not take long for everyone to know what the clues and hints all were. More cards made this almost impossible, and a good game became a great game. My only complaint is that some of the rules are really badly written. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rating based on one play. I was rather disappointed. It takes a really long time for the ghost to find a decent match, so the downtime is too high. Also, the pictures are so "far out" that it is more or less based on pure guessing/luck. The game has a little too much material/too complex set up for what it is. I will try it one more time. Hopefully I will get a better experience next time, because this is a really great idea.

Dixit with psychics. Love the fact that it is Co-op. A perennial favorite near Halloween. 

Collection Notes: we also own the Hidden Signs and Secrets & Lies expansions. 

That latter expansion solves my one complaint about the original: it replaces the borderline silly murder weapon cards with more evocative scenarios related to the murder.

BEAUTIFUL GAME, high quality cards, and striking art. This game can be either hilarious, or suspensful depending on the group (and beverages consumed) One player is a ghost and tries to convey the killer,location, and weapon to the other players, who are psychics. This is done by the ghost giving cards with striking art to each psychic, Each card has many things going on in foreground and background. The ghost tries to send a clue through this card, which represents an abstract dream/vision the psychic recieved. Each player has to guess a specific SET of the three. At the end, only one interpretation is correct, and all  players must vote. A lot of fun, deep thinking without complxity.

The only disappointing part is getting to the second phase (the straw poll) and losing - aside from that a very fun asymmetric game.

Sort of reverse Dixit, which is what makes it so brilliant (the discussion happens before the reveal, at least between the mediums). In my family I'm responsible for keeping the game on track, which would be nice to go without, but I won't complain – otherwise it's a lovely time we can all have together as a family. Even my younger child has made some interesting observations about things on the cards. So fun theme, great production, it's super.

If you like Dixit, chances are you will like this game with its large stack of mysterious, beautifully detailed cards which offer clues to solving mysteries. Very much the party, co-op game.  If you don't enjoy loose associations, perhaps this game isn't for you.
     This game takes a long time for setup by the Ghost who runs the game.  It's best if the game can be set up ahead of time.

Mysterium is a great-looking game, all the way from the box to each of the components. The full-frame large-format character and location cards are pretty much unparalleled, greatly contributing to the mysterious-yet-approachable feel of the game. However, in my experience, the gameplay itself fails to consistently deliver an enjoyable experience for different types of players: interpreting the twisted visions in the cards can range from delightful, to just meh, or all the way to boring or frustrating. So as much as the atmosphere can be captivating, the enjoyment provided by the core mechanic falls quite short, at least for me, in comparison to the great fun you could have with other party/family guessing games like Codenames.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Ok, first up, right-brain, arbitrary party style games aren't really my thing, but I have to admit they do have their place in any balanced games collection.  
It's actually quite fun to play a game occasionally that isn't analytical, especially one so well produced as this one, which alone constitutes 10/10.

My wife was really taken with this one; hardly surprising since she loves Dixit.  

If I was scoring this purely on the BGG scale and my desire to play in preference to my preferred Euros, I would probably score it a 6.   However, as a party style game I would give it a 8 to 9.  My rating is a reflection of all of these elements.

If there is one element in the game that fails slightly then it's the end game.  After all the rounds guessing suspects, the final "whodunit" comes down to 1 guess where the majority wins or loses.  I'm not sure how this could have been done better but it was slightly anti-climatic.

While it can come across as a mildly pointless exercise as there is hardly much "game" to look at here, the process of working out how your mediums or ghost as appropriate interpret the clues is quite fun and even remains so for multiple plays. The game does however certainly benefit greatly from fresh blood as a natural conversation meta-game develops around familiar players which is entertainingly confounding to newbies and keeps veterans vigilant.

This is a strange one.  Played he game and really enjoyed it, yet know I will never buy it. This game is a strang mixture of Dixit and Cluedo with some taking a role like a dungeon master.  At the simplest level, I finds games are either talking / laughing types or deep thinking everyone quiet types.  Mysterium is different as the DM role is in a world of his own, trying to work things out, etc. while the rest of the crowd chat amongst themselves and do an occasional move.  I like this aspect of the game, but you really need a good DM, as I would rather be one of the talkers!  So, will never buy this game, but happy to play at anytime, so a rating 7.617 (Dec 2015).

Oh. And the ghost can't talk.

Fun game. First playthrough takes a bit of time since there's a lot of parts. But my group liked it and will definitely be bringing it back to the table. 

A little more abstract than what you get with "Deception" but somewhat similar mechanics.

The art on the cards is gorgeous and half the fun was interpreting what the ghost was trying to tell us.

At first, I was turned off by this game, based on some early comparisons with Dixit (which I am not particularly fond of). However, the more I learned about Mysterium, I realized this was a game I must own!

Comparing Mysterium with its foreign-language counterpart Tajemnicze Domostwo, Mysterium is the one for me.

Purchased this based on the hype and it has mostly lived up to that. I really like it personally, but I could see it falling flat with some groups or getting old after awhile. My family is split on this - we have people who love it and people who have a hard time with the abstract thinking.  I think we may be house-ruling this one - for example, we may not use the timer, or may apply it also to the ghost, or we may not use the "vote" tokens, or if we do, we may not use the individual standings to view the final clues, and we definitely do voting on the final test in a different way, by identifying which clue alligns with which category. There's a lot of business going on that seems to get in the way of just having a fun romp with this game.  Like set-up and clean up are putzy, and there's a lot of down time as the ghost is thinking. Also, we pretty much let the ghost talk as long as s/he refrains from commenting on the game.

Some people say Mysterium should replace Dixit, but I don't see it this way. They share one game mechanism (guessing someone's "meaning" in an obscure picture) and beyond that the objectives are pretty different.

Interesting mix of Dixit with Cluedo...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cluedo meets Dixit - Mr Green in the Parlour with the Rope but this time you must deduce the murderer by discerning the truth from the often very vague and tenuous clues given in the form of a very beautiful but not necessarily very relevant picture on a Dixit card which represents the ghost of the victim trying to get in touch with you in your dreams to reveal the culprit.The ghost player has the most involvement in the game while the players playing the psychics mostly just tag along for the ride. This needs a bit of theatrical involvement by the players and some role play adds to the experience. If you like Dixit it adds a nice twist to the mechanic. Limited replay ability as the characters will quickly become stereotyped and your group will form accepted  interpretations.  

Great bits and components and typically good Dixit art throughout.

Our gaming group loves this game! Easy to teach, fun to play, and beautiful to look. I am always down to play this game! Which brings us to the caveot which i think was fixed in an expansion or can be fixed with dixit cards. 

When we first bought this game, we played 3 straight times in a row, which lead to our first and only problem: there needs to be more cards! We felt it was to easy to remember how the cards were used previously, so we had to limit ourselves to only once everytime it was pulled out.

Ok so this was on my hype list for awhile. But after playing it...idk. Really pretty, good game, had a good time playing, but I think there are other games that have the same pay out (guessing cool stuff on abstract clues) without as much overhead. Deception Murder in HK and Dixit come to mind. However, this is probably my favorite theme of those.

Highly enjoyable party game, it works really well with 5 to 7 players (in fact, I don't like playing Mysterium with less than 5 people). The role of the ghost is crucial, s/he needs to be familiar with the game and be able to play fast (if this is not the case, then turns take too long).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My initial impression is 7. 1st stage of game is identifying a person, a place, and a thing for no other reason then saying this may be the way the ghost player had been murdered. Once you have the list of possible scenarios of murder you start stage two which is vote on the most likely scenario after seeing 1,2 or 3 clues depending on your performance earlier in the game. Once each player has secretly voted without discussion the majority vote is the teams choice of solution and if it matches the ghost players scenario then everyone wins. If not, everyone loses. It's OK. It isn't amazing either. Fun activity which seemed to lack direction. 

Sums up as a bunch of psychics work to make sense of their own dream and shares the dream with the group. Group makes a choice of who's dream is correct with some clues from a ghost. Yay?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a fun social game, with evocative artwork and a nice -albeit macabre- theme! It works pretty well with non-gamers. When I first read about it I was thrilled! Dixit with a purpose they called it and they were right! But I must admit it sounds better in theory. That's not to say it's a bad game. It just leaves a little to be desired.

I played the ghost and it was REALLY hard for me. I realized that I don't think my brain works well in this abstract sort of artsy way. I think I will enjoy this game a lot more as a Psychic instead of the ghost. We didn't get to the last phase of the game because of finishing round 7 without everybody learning their info. The game is so unique though and I'm looking forward to playing again.

A good cross of dixit, mastermind, clue, and charades.

The ghost uses dixit picture cards to get the others to guess which of a set of cards he's got for them.

Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.

RATING: 6
The designer obviously played "Dixit" and thought it would be cool to combine it with "Clue" and make it cooperative. An important change from "Dixit", though, is that the "active player" never changes. One player is the ghost and must help the other players solve various murders by giving them cards with visual clues for location, weapon and perpetrator of each crime.

The problem is that, when all players solve their assigned crimes, they must find out which of those is the murder of the ghost character. According to how successful their previous guesses were, each player sees one to three cards and must secretly choose which crime refers to the ghost. Victory or defeat is determined by this single voting, and the rest of the game just serves to set how many cards each player can see. It still is an interesting and enjoyable game, but losing because a majority of players made a wrong guess at this crucial moment can be very frustrating.

Mysterium is a great party game with the right ghost and mood of the group. It's a lot of fun if it all clicks, but it's also very sensitive to that - if the setting isn't just right, it may not engage the group enough.

I actually think all the changes that were made from the 1st Edition are great. From the components to the introduction of those betting chips (if your colleagues are right or wrong) to the artwork.
The scaleble difficulty levels also seem balanced to keep it interesting.

There's chrome leaking out of this over produced box, but that's how i like it. :)

Oh and the dixitish gameplay is of course very engaging across all sorts & ages of players.

Co-op game with an extra twist. That's probably the best thing about the game. It's basically a game of mystery in which you have to solve all sorts of puzzles in order to get through the game. Basically a party game because this game is not for those who want a serious competitive experience. With children this could be really fun, also with the people who are not as accustomed to board-gaming as you might be. It's just hard to see that this game has any serious longevity. There's a fair chance of growing bored of it sooner than expected.

Mysterium is a game that delivers bags of ambiance when played under the right conditions; in our session, we had the lights down low, the Mysterium soundtrack playing, and a strict 'the ghost makes no sound' (aside from knocks for yes/no) policy, which added a chilling role play dimension to the proceedings.

For me, the standout aspect of Mysterium is the artwork. It's both gorgeous and bizarre, which furthers the dark atmosphere, and truly makes the game come alive (...excuse the pun). The mechanics - 'Dixit meets Cluedo' - are solid, but it is the marriage with the theme that elevates the experience.

Playing as a psychic had practically no learning curve. Simply discuss hypothesis with fellow psychics - and then make a simple choice. I felt valuable and involved from the very first play-through with other experienced players, with my interpretations of certain cards adding an additional consideration.

Playing as the ghost requires a little more understanding, and a few things to keep track of, but nothing too taxing. 

The potential flaw with Mysterium, is after a few play throughs, players may know to correspond certain dream cards with specific people, places and locations. This is a double-edged sword however. In a recent game, the ghost provided a dream card that the psychics automatically assumed meant the policeman - due to it being used as such on previous play-throughs - only for it to actually have represented someone else.

Overall, this is a very good game, elevated to a great game if you are willing to invest in the theme and get lost in the ambiance.

Good game, just pleeeeease, I don`t want to do the setup again. It`s so boring and long to setup everything (usually the ghost has to do almost everything, in order to keep the secret and don`t spoil it in the first minute). In my opinion it`s better than Dixit, since the theme is really good, but that setup time is horrible. This is a party game, but I can`t just pull out and play, since the setup time is so long that instead we can play a round using another party game. That`s why Mysterium currently just sitting on the shelf and waiting for someone to setup a game, because I just don`t want to.

It`s an 8 game, if someone else is doing the setup :D

I didn't like it the first time I played but it has grown on me more and more. I think it's a very good game especially with a larger group or newer gamers. The only pain is that it takes a bit to setup. Apart from that it's fun as an inspector and very challenging but different fun as the ghost.

I was worried that this game would require the perfect lighting or setting, or  mood to full enjoy this game, such as it's only good on Halloween, or I need to set up a seance to make Mysterium great. I was glad that I was wrong...and boy how glad I was. The guys at Dicetower, whom I pretty much see to eye-to-eye on their opinions, were completely wrong on this one. After 5 plays I can whole-heartedly say Mysterium is just a great game in any situation.

It plays fairly quick, has great components, easy to teach and, to me, is a great gateway and is up there with some of the other great gateway games like Ticket to Ride, Shadows Over Camelot,7 Wonders etc. 

My two small quibbles is that having a ghost player that is having some difficulty with being able to think outside the box or help with giving out clues can become kind of detrimental. And the new rules I honestly don't care too much for. I feel it can break the spirit(no pun intended) of the game by adding unnecessary "competitive" aspects. It's a full co-op game. I use the original, Tajemnicze Domostwo's polish rules, and the game is still awesome. I may try the new rules one day, but not in a rush to do so.
One of my favorites of 2015.

The game has fallen a bit for me, people have to really be in the mood to play it. If you look at it, it's not technically a game but more a social interaction amongst players. If you have one person that's just lame and doesn't want to play, the game will fall apart fast, hence why I am very careful in who I pick to play this game with now

This game is not deduction, it is a LENGTHY CO-OP DIXIT. Which isn't bad at all! If that is what you your expectations are. I would play this again. I just think it's very strange that I've heard it described as deduction when that isn't what this is at all.

Definitely more fun with people you know.
Some "ghosts" like to clue things off color while others would never do that (like me).
During the first portion of the game, if a player received a LOT of cards for their clue (5-7), it was assumed that the ghost was not giving a real clue but cleaning out their hand. ... which in itself did provide some information ("hmm this card would have been perfect for this card, but it was thrown into the garbage dump..."). That way the discard tokens could be saved for the very final round.

Dixit meets Clue(do) and not as good as either. It can be VERY difficult for the 'ghost' player to find suitable clues in the available cards, and this governs how successful the players collectively are. I do wish designers would stop combining two games to make a third, it never works.

March '17 update: this has been steadily climbing the ranks to end up as a top ten game for me. It just lands so beautifully with so many different kinds of players and groups. Modern masterpiece. Instant classic. 

What can I say about [b]Mysterium[/b] that hasn't already been said? It takes something like [b]Dixit[/b] and runs with it to make it amazing. And until you've been the ghost, you don't get to say a word about the decisions the ghost makes. The hardest part of this game isn't winning, it's keeping a straight face as the ghost while your players are talking themselves out of EXACTLY what you were trying to get them to guess.

This is an amazing game.  It was our fourth game of the day, we didn't start playing it until about 23:00 and we ended up playing it four times in succession, the only game of the day to get a reply.  Part of that, of course, is because it's relatively short; it takes about 42 minutes to play...it's brilliant though, very different from our usual kind of game.  Think cluedo, but (initially) you're all trying to put together a different combination of murderer/location/weapon, and you're doing it based on 'visions' given to you by a silent ghost; these 'visions' are pictures that the ghost has to try to relate to the murderer/location/weapon (and you have to guess what the link is).  Loads of fun!

3p, 4p, 5p, 6p or 7p? A social deduction game. Similar to Dixit and Deception. Dixit cards can be used as vision cards, but Dixit cards have fewer details, so linking Dixit cards with psychic cards could be difficult. Most session videos show 4 psychics, and 4 seems like a realistic maximum. How could 5+ psychics get a good look at the psychic cards without having to stand up or sit on each other's laps?

It looked like it would give us an "upscale Clue" feeling, with a bit of Dixit mixed in. Turns out to be quite fiddly, and not very good at two. If you frequently get parties of heavy boardgamers going, give it a shot, but I can't honestly recommend otherwise.

Bought this one a while back and finally got it out to play.  It's quickly become a favorite for most of those we game with and an excellent intro game for our friends who view most board games as "odd".  I've found I don't like to play it too often with the same people however, especially not with the same person as the ghost, as the particular ghost's pattern becomes known rather than deduced.  I'm actually considering picking up Dixit just to use the cards in it as a variation for the vision decks and provide a bit more replayability since I mostly game with family.

I played the PC version. I never understood the concept, I don't understand what connection exists between the clues and the suspects. Everything is too vague for me. It is a Dixit-like game, that adds some story in the game. Heavily luck-based game, as the cards coming up do not always match to the case.
Perhaps my opinion will change if I play the board version of the game.
For now I think that I dodged a bullet as another user said.

A fair and honest challenge that is surprisingly engaging, and exciting to watch unfold from either side of the screen. Invokes storytelling and insanity. A match made in Tiger Heaven.

(Edit: Revised down sharply. Want this out of my top 10. I still really like it...but my group likes it *too much*. It lacks staying power as a co-op once you make connections that "X always means Y when you are given this vision." Also, when you are playing with a ghost that does not understand and refuses to try to understand how you think? Ugh.)

I really wanted to like this more than I do. I love Dixit and the conceit for how this game uses similar ideas to solve a mystery is compelling. In actual play, after three sessions with two groups, the fun just wasn't clicking for anyone. The biggest potential issue is that for the entire hour of play one person is giving out all of the clues. There is definitely an art to reading the group in games like Codenames, Dixit, Apples to Apples, etc. In those games, the judge role turns over fast enough that everyone gets a shot and oddball tastes are a spice, not the main course. In Mysterium, there was palpable frustration for both players and ghost as failures to communicate compound over rounds with a fail state. It's too long from when the ghost starts clue-giving to when they can talk out their logic and commiserate with the others. I very much admire Mysterium, especially the art, but I can't imagine playing it again over Codenames or another party game with shorter cycles.

A gorgeously produced game is a fun cooperative murder mystery. However, strategy gamers beware, this can be a very frustrating game because it relies universally on abstract and subject perceptions. Its fun, there's a wonderful mechanic for time constraints and it really nails its thematic elements. But if you desire strategy and logic, look elsewhere. It loses a few points because of this and also because it gets monotonous after a few plays. If you want to keep it fresh, expansion cards are a must.

This game was a nice surprise to me. The argument of the game is that you are in a haunted mansion where the ghost is a former employee that was killed 30 years ago. On Halloween, a number of psychics go to the house and try to connect with the ghost, which is played by one player, the issue is that it happens some time ago and the memory of the ghost is fragile and he doesn't really remember and, instead of providing clear information, it communicates with the players through abstract images that relate, someway somehow, to the killer, the room and the weapon that killed him. Basically all the players have to work together in order to succeed, the ghost is on the same side, but he or she is not allow to talk throughout the game. The game should take less than an hour, so it is not a huge problem to be quiet for that time, it allows to create some nice atmosphere.
This game, to me, is closely related to Dixit: the ghost tries to tell a story through weird pictures that have to be understood by the players, and they, after, have to decide what the heck is the ghost trying to say. It takes that original mechanic of Dixit and it goes one step further. Highly recomendable for groups of different types of players.
Positive:
1. The theme is very well integrated with the mechanics
2. It is very easy to explain and to play
3. It is a different type of cooperative game as one player cannot speak or communicate
4. The cards are very beautiful and creative
5. I have not tried, but I thing that the cards of Dixit can be used as vision cards
Negative:
1. You have to be very careful about not telling, after the game, what were you trying to indicate with this or that card, because the game may lose the replayability (does that word exist? do you understand what I want to say?)

Bij Pascal, 29/12/2015. Iemand speelt de verteller (achter scherm); de rest speelt samen en moet (een beetje zoals bij Cluedo) achtereenvolgens een moordenaar, moordplaats en -wapen vinden. De verteller krijgt 7 Dixit-achtige kaarten en gebruikt die om een of meerdere spelers een tip te geven. Raden kost een uur tijd; wie juist heeft geraden, mag naar het volgende stadium (vb. de moordplaats) om dat te raden. Als alle spelers alles hebben geraden, volgt een eindronde om te beslissen welke oplossing nu de juiste is (opnieuw aan de hand van tips en overleg). Heel mooi artwork. Luchtig spel; leuk voor af en toe.

It's Dixit but with a game attached. Definitely a party game, and for that it's near perfect.

Having now played both sides they're both a ton of fun and work really well. I think being a psychic is a bit more relaxing, and being the ghost gives just enough stress that you want in a co-op. Though that feeling might have also come from me being ghost the first time we jumped up a difficulty level. We have never lost though, so if you want a brutally hard co-op, this probably isn't it.

This is an interesting game which crosses over to party game.    It's a co-op in which each player is an investigator trying to solve a murder or the ghost trying to give them clues.  The ghost gets a hand of cards with weird surrealistic scenes, representing dreams and visions the ghost can send.  Each investigator gets a suspect, location, and murder weapon card.  The ghost then hints to the investigators which of them has the appropriate suspect, location, or weapon card by playing image cards that relate to the investigator (rather than directly to the murder card).  Each investigator has a colorful persona (e.g., artist) that provides a basis to relate to the cards.  It's a bit of an odd mechanic but provides a greater range of associations.  The players then try to figure out the clues.  While it is co-op, players can definitely compete to be the MVP by making the best guesses.  There is enough thinking that it works as a strategy game while it is light enough to also work as a party game.  It's not a first choice for me but I wouldn't turn down a game if my friends wanted to play,
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mysterium is an interesting game and puts a unique spin on the "interpreting art" concept popularized in Dixit, but I find that its structure as a co-op game lessens the experience. It doesn't feel like the game warrants a table full of people discussing and interpreting clues. This becomes apparent at the game's end when everyone has to solve a puzzle independently and come to a consensus without discussion. That was easily the most enjoyable portion of the game and one I could see sustaining a longer experience.

While being the ghost is the most rewarding (and challenging) part of the game, it is a bit disappointing that only one person at the table gets to tackle this position while everyone else plays a much lesser role.

The game has great art and some good ideas, but I wish the game imposed a bit more structure on how players communicate - I believe that would be a much more interesting challenge.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (November 2015)

I love Mysterium. I have the previous edition (Tajemnicze Domostwo) and I also own the new Asmodee edition. I still haven’t read the rules so I don’t know if there is reason to keep both games in my game collection. I wanted to see what are the rules´ differences but when we played Mysterium we were only 3 players so the gameplay was exactly as before (or so the game explainer told me). I plan to play it again soon to see for myself. I know that players now have some tokens but I don’t know how to use them.

On the other hand I really appreciate the change components wise. In particular I really like that the ghost now has a screen that helps him to keep his cards organized. Also I noted that the dream cards remain the same but the suspect, place and object cards feature new art. I liked it but I also liked the old art. I’m undecided which one is the best one.

Mysterium takes Dixit´s core mechanism and turns it into a great cooperative game with simple rules. The art is GREAT. Love the theme. I think it is best as a 4 player game, with more the game begins to drag with lots of downtime. I feel the ghost player has the most fun, but the game is very fun overall. 

So far I don’t have any complaint about the game, It is hard to beat but I like that. Perhaps the game comes with very few cards (has a low replay value), so if you play often some patterns will emerge (same clues for same suspect/place/object) but that can be easily solved using Dixit cards.

Bottom line, I’m rating Mysterium the same I rated Tajemnicze Domostwo as the gameplay remains the same (for 3 players at least). So far I have only seen improvement in the components´ department but I’m very keen in playing the game again soon. I will read the rules to see what changed between editions and when I do I will come back to comment again.

At last I played Mysterium with enough players to feel the difference. After all players have correctly guessed their suspects, places and objects, now each player has to guess one more and if the majority of players guessed right, all players win. I really like it! I feel it is a minor improvement over the previous version of the game. I particularly like that each player gets to see 1,2 or 3 cards depending upon their performance in the previous phases.

All things considered, I think the Asmodee edition is better than the others, but I’m still unsure if I will keep both them or not. Perhaps the expansion can help me decide, or perhaps I will keep both editions.

Clue meets Dixit. Intriguing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As a fan of Dixit, I love playing this game. Its cooperative mechanism is more interesting than other games I've played, because it only involves players' choices. There is a lot of conversation around the table, and playing the ghost is really fun. Although it has been compared to Cluedo (you have to find the assassin, the place and the weapon of the crime), only the theme is shared with it: the mechanisms are far from being random and there are no dice-rolls involved! A great game for imaginative people, who like to play with their friends and family. Better with more than 4 players.

RATING: 6
Interesting co-op game that mixes clue-giving and pattern matching. Almost a weird offspring of Codenames, Cluedo and Dixit.

Chris made the point that the first 95% of the game (while fun) is essentially just a long-winded set up for the last 5 minutes of play when the group tries to deduce which set of cards the ghost player has selected. All the preamble does is determine how many of the three cards in the set each player can look at. And he's right.

I played the Polish version and loved it. The English version is just as good and can be played the same way. I like the additions they have included in the new release, though I typically exclude them when I first teach this game.

The game is amazing, hands down. If Dixit and Clue had a mute baby, they would produce this game. It is a close second to the Resistance as a party game, only because it takes longer to play.

This game is clue meets dixit. Just played this game with my wife, her mother and my four year old daughter. What an amazing family game!!! 
After going through the rules we played the game with minimal reference to the rule book (mostly set up) and on the second play we didn't reference it at all. 
Lots of replayability and simple to adjust the games difficulty level. The components are top notch and the art is amazing. Can't wait to pick the expantion that's coming out soon.

2015-10-16 - First impression: Take Dixit and make it a cooperative whodunit. It's amazing. I really enjoyed my play of this and hope to get a copy as soon as it's released here. I don't know if it will suffer from the need for expansions the way Dixit does. It might, but only more plays will tell.

2016-07-19 - I have played this many times now, and I love it. It's not going to be for everyone. If you don't at least like the idea behind Dixit or Codenames: Pictures, it probably won't be for you.

The description that this is a cross between Dixit and Clue is dead-on accurate. That is exactly what this is and the effect is to make a game that is WAY better than Clue and about on par with Dixit, using the abstract cards to deduce a suspect, a location, and a weapon.

The one knock I would give this game is that playing the Clue Master is a lot more work than playing the other roles and it is fairly stressful. There is a huge imbalance there that makes this a bit of an odd one - especially given its cooperative nature.

I wonder, though, how often I would choose to play this over simply playing Dixit...

RATING: 7
Super fun game, very creative. But in dire need of expansions because the dream cards are limited, and we keep seeing them over and over again on repeated plays. Meta-information builds up such that we know exactly what is associated with what dream card and makes the game really easy. Also the game is way over-produced compared to the original.

RATING: 6.5
A very good party deduction game. One person is a ghost and may give the mediums cards which are clues to the murder.  The ghost must select from seven cards in their hand which cards to give to whom.  The mediums can consult together as to the meaning of the clues.  The only thing that holds me back from rating this more highly is that this game is very ghost dependent.  A ghost with AP will slow things down and if your ghost can't get on the wave length of the other players, it can be frustrating to be a medium. With the right ghost, great game; wrong ghost and its painful.

詭祕莊園 是個合作遊戲，遊戲中考驗玩家間彼此的默契及心靈相通的程度，新版配件增加了鬼魂檔板，讓扮演鬼魂的玩家可以更專注於挑選卡片以及尋找相似的提示元素，而在後期揭露元兇有著更挑戰性的任務，每個靈媒玩家除了找出自己的線索之外，還需要協助並參與其他靈媒的判斷，以提升"靈視等級"，增加後續追查真兇的正確率，所以玩家間是無法 silence disengagement (自掃門前雪)，這樣的機制讓遊戲性大為提升，也讓玩家彼此的連結趨於相近，我覺得是這款遊戲相當成功的地方。
一個好的合作遊戲不外乎讓所有玩家共同獲得遊戲樂趣，玩家與玩家的互動熱絡，遊戲情境到位，以及具有挑戰性，我想 詭祕莊園 做到了這幾點，有興趣的朋友，不妨來試試。

Really a good co-op which relies on communication, not possible to play on your own such as many others. Clear semilarities with Dixit but much more fun to play.

Great game that falls somewhere in the realm of Clue-meets-Dixit. Fantastic. Has never fallen flat for me. Down-time can be a little high with a slow ghost but we haven't played with the "full" rules yet (we're basically playing with the original Polish Rules with the added tension of the timer) so that might help...but the divided-information and extra complexity just doesn't interest me.

All I knew before playing Mysterium is the Clue heritage of it combined with Dixit cards. What sounded intriguing, turned out to be a group-dependent communication exercise that failed to grab me notwithstanding that the majority of the group knew the game before and enjoys it enough to repeatedly play it.

The main offender for me is the scoring system which is essential for seeing more clues at game end to find the final solution. To score points, players have to gauge the correctness of other players guesses on their character, location and murder weapon. Mostly, it's about knowing what the game master aims at with his hints. Once this recognition process has fallen into known conventions, the decision about the correctness of guesses loses all interest with all players then making the same guesses.

The artwork and theme are enticing, the game fails in the mechanisms.

Full co-op CLUE with abstract art. The art work and theme is great, however the game felt flat to me. The voting mechanic seem unnecessary and function just to add more upkeep and score keeping accounting chore. The physic player really don't have much to do, guess the card they were given and THAT ITs, which ultimately depends on what card the ghost player even have.

Dislike how there is always "The possibility" that the ghost just had bad cards and hand you useless stuff, and you loses/ went on wrong track/ arguing half an hour of nonsense interpretation simply because of it.

Mysterium is a blast. Who wouldn't want to play a psychic attempting to solve the murder of an incorporeal being? It's a wonderfully refreshing twist on the formula of Clue, the classic in which its roots reside. The nonverbal aspect of the ghost is an awesome gameplay mechanic, but it is also what creates the most frustrating part of the game. If you don't know the person who is the ghost, then interpreting the cards they give you as a psychic can be difficult at times. All in all, a wonderful game!

Es buen juego. Es como un dixit para cuando no te apetece estar inventando y diciendo abstracciones y chorradas. Se usan cartas muy similares y se emplea igual la imaginación y pensar qué pueden imaginarse los demás, para que interpreten con las imágenes de las cartas, lo que quieres comunicarles, sin poder hablar con ellos. Se crea una atmósfera muy interesante que es el valor de este juego, porque además del arte espectacular y componentes, usando la banda sonora, todo funciona muy bien.
Sin embargo, una vez probado, le falla que el despliegue sea tan laborioso para ser un juego bastante simple. Da mucha pereza sacarlo a mesa: cuando quieres algo más avanzado, no lo sacas porque no es mucha cosa, y cuando quieres algo rápido, no lo sacas por la preparación.

English Edition Previously owned. I found everyone would want to be the players and no one wanted to be the ghost - leaving it to me to play. After doing that for about 8 times in a row it gets a bit boring. Sure, I could have insisted someone else play the ghost, but I think the game had earned a retirement with another owner. I would play this again, but I wouldn't purchase it. Beautiful Art for the people. I hope the artist gets plenty of work in the board game world after this. I know if I was looking to make a board game I would be calling that person(s) up and offering them a job.

A modern twist on the game of Clue, this game pulls you in and encompasses your sense of artistic expression and ability to read between the lines!

Can you figure it out in time?

I review this while noting that I haven't actually learned how to play as the ghost (it's a to-do for the future). 

First of all, this game is all about the artwork, and the artwork is effing fantastic, absolutely worth expletives of awe. For this reason, and its passing similarity to Clue, this game has gotten to the table way more often than I expected - it's still a bit specific to people who are predisposed to humor me with "just one game", but it has been quite successful every time we've played. 

The setup is pretty intense, and we haven't played enough to really streamline it. Because there are so many pieces and several different play aspects, new players really chomp at the bit to learn about all the pieces and ideas, even though really, it just needs some patience while the ghost does their thing. In the future, I think we'll try to open this up while also having a short filler game ready for non-ghost players to keep them occupied. (Love Letter is a strong contender here, especially since they are thematically kind of similar enough). 

I would say the one big drawback, and the reason this doesn't hit 9 or 10 on the ratings, is the rulebook, which is really confusing and poorly organized. I'm very glad we learned via family who already knew the game, because I think learning it from scratch would have been pretty difficult and frustrating. It's still kind of annoying to have to go back and answer questions using the rulebook, since it's often not clear where one would go to answer the questions. The game also tries to be coy by naming all the pieces thematic things like "clairvoyancy tokens", but that doesn't end up being helpful since it's not obvious which of the pieces is actually the clairvoyancy token. 

I also worry a little that play value will be decreased slightly over time as players get used to a certain ghost's playstyle and thought process, but at that point, expansions will be considered and new ghosts trained up, because the game itself is really good and I am never unhappy to get a chance with that artwork.

This is an okay co-operative deduction game.  The nature of the pictures used to provide clues are so vague in relation to the clues that much of the deduction is just take-a-stab-in-the-dark guesswork.  However, there have been times where the people I've played this with have made playing it a hoot.  But that's a tribute to the players, not the game.  I'm willing to play if others want to play but likely would never suggest it.

Absolutely love the theme and the artwork. I was considering buying the game for that alone. I love the core aspects of the game - using the cards to help players figure out the nature of the crime. That alone would've been enough for me. But there's a lot of fiddly bits in there like the voting and the end-game guessing if you make it to the last section. Really odd and not intuitive. It turns a cooperative game into a semi-competitive one. Not sure what the point was. Definitely an atmospheric game that can be great with the right group and the right setting.

I wanted to like this game much more than I did.
I like Dixit and was looking forward to seeing its evolution.
I like the direction this attempts, but it did not turn out to be fun for me.
It is also more abstract than I thought, I don't see how the 1st round relates to the 2nd.

Definitely dependent upon having a good player playing the ghost.  Easy to confuse a couple rules as well.  It can really be difficult to find a good card for a clue as the ghost.  It seems like more of a game than Dixit as your ultimately working to find your person, place, and thing.  It's also neat that each player has their own combination to find and then at the end having to choose the real culprit from among all of them.  The art is beautiful, of course, and overall nicer than Dixit (I believe though perhaps purposefully more detailed).  The screen works better than any game I've ever seen (And I've seen a lot!) with how you put things into the pockets and such.  After a few games even our 8 year old son was able to play the ghost reasonably well.  We most often play with 3 and its great with that number.  2 player wasn't bad by any stretch either.  We've not played with enough players yet to use the other tokens that make the game competitive, but enjoy playing it purely cooperatively instead.  We've gone ahead and picked up the expansion which adds loads more of each type of card.  Wonderful physical components and card quality as well all around.

8 Somehow overstayed its welcome. 

I simply can not find much negative about this game. Usually I am not into CoOp but this is plain fun. Nobody in my gaming round disliked it so far. Overall positive gaming experience. You can buy this game blind and enjoy it.

Only downside is a very long setup which is a bit annoying. Also the Endgame is a bit anticlimactic. 

The Art is absolutely stunning and detailed.

So perfect. After maybe 30 games, most of which are played using a big ol' chunk of dixit clue cards, it has remained a crowd favourite. The fiance especially loves to be ghost when she's tired at the end of a night, because "you don't have to socialise or speak to anyone. You can just sit there judging everyone's stupidity or admiring your own genius."

Really enjoy this game. It's definitely a challenge, but doesn't get old after multiple playthroughs (at least it hasn't yet after 10 or so games in the past 6 weeks or so). Also a game that seems as much fun with 4 players as it does with 7. Always a contender to be played at board game night, with a lot of people requesting it. Fun as a ghost or a psychic, with different challenges in each role.  Highly recommend this for people who like co-op problem solving games.

CO-OP DIXIT. One player plays as a ghost, the rest play as psychics trying to figure out who killed the ghost. It's really fun because everyone has to get a prediction and then all collectively pick the correct murderer at the end. Solve the mystery or have the ghost never rest in peace. This game is fun if you have at least 4 players.

RATING: 8
I like it a lot. Both as ghost or as medium.

It's very similar to Dixit in a way.

We played it with Dixit cards and it also worked pretty well.

If it would have more cards included I would maybe give it a 8.5 or 9. But maybe with the upcoming expansion and more cards I will increase the rating.

If you play with 7 people there are not enough cards in the base game included in my opinion. You will play through the whole card pile to give clues as a ghost... and in the grand final round you might have to reuse clue cards that were already used and that can be like cheating, because you as a ghost already know what people think about these cards or where they belong to.... so it makes the game really easy to win. Suggestion: use Dixit cards for 7 players to have more clues :-)

The theme could make a bit more sense and I wish it was a bit more like Clue when it came to the story, but the art is fantastic as are the mechanics! I have no interest in playing Dixit, but this I'd gladly play any time.

Mysterium plays like a murder mystery meets Dixit. The art on this game is beautiful and overall the play experience is enjoyable. This will be a great addition to the Betrayal at House on the Hill & Arkham Horror for Halloween time.

Another solid deduction game and fun co-op. The final selection aspect of the game is what makes it so powerful to me, because you have to use the previous nights' information about how your ghost selects cards to give to the other players to determine how that ghost is leading you in those final three cards. It definitely gives the sense of completeness to the game rather than it just becoming a co-op race to the finish.

One of the best games for non gaming groups. I've yet to find someone who doesn't enjoy this game. It is fun and very interactive. The artwork is beautiful. The rules are a bit fiddly, so we had to alter it a bit, but that doesn't bother me.

This is like a worse version of Dixit: less game, less decision AND co-operative. Sure I can play it again if there isn't anything better availabe. But Dixit makes things much better and is faster to play so I don't see any reason to play Mysterium.

RATING: N/A
Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.

In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.

It's much better than Dixit because you don't need to be THAT creative. You could say Mysterium is a lot more "boardgame-y" than Dixit. But in the end it's always the same with interpretation games like that. It depends heavily on the people playing it. You need to play it with really good friends to make it work and to have fun. I love playing the ghost but if you're sitting at the table with people who don't get how you're thinking it falls rather flat and feels random.

Dixit meets Clue. One player is a traumatized spirit. The other players are mediums trying to interprete the spirit's dreamlike visions. The objective of the game is for all mediums to guess who killed the spirit, where he was killed and with what object.

This game is somewhat overproduced and has a lot of components. Don't get me wrong, the game looks fantastic. But setting up the game can be quite a lengthy process, especially considering what the game boils down to.

I like the game slightly more than Dixit, but Dixit plays faster and all players are doing the same. Getting to play the spirit can be a lot of fun, but it can also be frustrating ordeal. I do like that it can play up to 7 players. A game I will play when I'm in the mood for it.

E' della risma dei party game alla Dixit.

Despite the gorgeous artwork and the cool premise I don't really understand the huge hype for this game. It's basically charades with pictures after all, and while charades isn't a bad game and there's a little bit of hand management in this game I don't think it should be highly lauded. Also, 42ish minutes is a long time to only achieve getting 4 correct guesses. In addition, I dislike how the only collaboration is discussion, as any "aid" you could give to others could actually make them choose the wrong card.

Compared to Dixit the combination of no word clues and also that it's a co-op helps prevents giving super specific clues that only one person can get, so guess per guess I think it's better implemented with only a slight I missing of the aspect of Dixit of wanting to be netiher too obscure or obvious. However, as previously stated in Mysterium you simply don't get to have as many guesses per game.

EDIT: The tokens you can use to endorse or refute another person's choice adds a little bit of interaction, but still not enough in my opinion.

Before making this list, I expected Mysterium to be a lot higher. But for some reason, other games just kept beating it out on the list. I'm not sure if it's because Mysterium has lost some of its sparkle for me or that other things are just more enjoyable, but Mysterium was barely edged out of my Top 50. I think it's partially because a stubborn investigator can definitely break a game but never getting things right just like a complete mind meldy player can break it by getting everything right and there being no real tension. The tension of being able to solve the murder is really what makes this game so amazing.

My favorite role is hands down the Ghost. I love adapting to how other players are interpreting the clues I send them and trying to fit my clues to the way that they think.

First play fell a little flat. Too abstract for my friends; they didn't feel much tension or get into it, but the overall experience was still positive. Some good moments were had when murder weapon clues were misinterpreted (by far the most difficult stage), but plenty of others felt like the players were pretending to care to keep the game moving (or maybe I was pretending to enjoy being the ghost, because I rarely had any trouble giving clues).

I think limiting the number of dreams to one per player is an extremely important house rule. It gives each dream more weight, eliminates the possibility of the ghost doing a hand dump, and makes it easier to play cooperatively as there are fewer clues for everyone to look at.

Clairvoyance tokens are difficult to explain and feel contrived. Actually my issue is the whole game feels kind of contrived, in the sense that it puts too much window dressing and "stuff" on a simple concept, trying to force the fun.

Phenomenal game, with a couple of conditions: the ghost should at least be a bit experienced with dixit cards, in order to give clues at a decent speed, and the players should enjoy some imaginative thinking. 
If you meet these small requirements, the game is fabulous.

A cross between Dixit and Clue.  I played the American version.  I must admit, I did not think I would like the game but grudgingly had to admit it was fun.  I can see where repeated plays might cause this to require expansions to make it more repayable.  Eventually, I can see certain cards being used to match certain persons, locations and weapons.  

Overall though it was a fun game and better than Dixit.

Fun game of looking at hidden meanings in bizarre and beautiful 'vision' cards. Can be frustrating for the ghost player when the players see something unintended in the card, or if the ghost players draws a hand of bad cards. Long set up time, too. Other than that, it's a great co-op game with a really unique mechanic.

Libellud took a long time to update Mysterium and bring it to market and did so with mixed results. The cover box is outstanging, the ghost game screen is a nice addition, the new art on back of dream cars is great as well, and the clock and crow markers are nice too. On the other hand, the new art for the psychic cards is quite different, more comic book-ish and in a sense less detailed. The worst part of this version is the clairvoyance track and markers. I'm not sure why this was added to the game, maybe to ensure that all players paid attention to everyone's dream cards which in a cooperative game shouldn't a problem in the first place, but it adds fiddlyness to the game which makes it less elegant than the original. The silent shared vision is also less interesting for a cooperative game. The best version of the rules remains the initial version.

(review after only two play as "ghost")
Great presentation; the components, art, and "fluff" is all top notch.  Easy to get in character as the ghost.  Game is harder than it seems at first, which is a good thing.  I look forward to playing it again, although my group responded to the first play of the game with some mixed feelings; some were eager to play it again right away while others were somewhat frustrated by the difficulty and what they perceived as opacity.  

Playing it again I noticed that it was much smoother, and everyone in the group enjoyed it, players of different ages, experience, and style.  It is definitely a crowd pleaser and unique among games (especially if someone has never played Dixit).  I have some concerns with replayability, but definitely a solid addition to any collection.

Interesting game which is like a super frustrating but more unique take on Clue. The ghost player really needs to be on their game with the visions they give the psychics, otherwise everyone is in for a rough time. Of course, there's only so much you can do as the ghost, which is where the frustration comes in. I think a lot of ghost players will probably err on the side of "lots of clues" - a double-edged sword which I'm not sure is always the best choice unless the recurring theme in the chosen set of clues is incredibly obvious.

Not sure if I like the "killer is chosen at the very end" mechanic. Thematically it doesn't make any sense, since if the ghost knows whodunnit, why would they bother giving all but one of the psychics incorrect visions? Of course, if that were the case then it could only really work as a 2-player game so whatever. It's still fun.

Clue (without the annoying infinite spaces between rooms and, therefore, plays) meets Dixit! This game is deeply gorgeous in design and layout. Like Dixit, you can spend time just looking at the board, the cards, everything. This game is a fun play, but as we usually only have two players in our group, one of the main flaws in play is that the ghost has a bit more fun than the other player -- the ghost spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to provide accurate clues while the other player just waits for that to happen. But I could see at, with a few more people, the dynamics would change.

This is like Dixit, but cooperative and much better. If you're not sure what Dixit is, it's like Balderdash with art instead of words, and much better.

In Mysterium, one player plays as a ghost who has enlisted a team of psyhics (all the other players), in hopes that they will help him solve his murder and get closure. The ghost communicates to all the other players solely by sending them visions (i.e. cards with very obscure art), and the players use this to determine possible suspects, murder locations, and weapons in order to solve the case.

This is a fantastic game, that is made all the much better in this edition. We used to have the Portal games Polish edition but swopped it for this. This is much better and if you are thinking of swopping the two I would recommend to do it. 

As well as loving the artwork, and bits that come in this edition, the screen is just brilliant and makes the game so much easier and flowing. We also really enjoy the new clairvoyance track and how this interacts with the teams guessing mechanics for the final round. This edition, for us, is a winner all around.

If Mysterium were a song, for me, it would be "Frontier Psychiatrist" by The Avalanches. Have a look It's either the best video you've never seen or one of the best you have!

RATING: 8.5
Mysterium almost lives up to its hype and it definitely is a great game.
The game has a few minor problems with rules which allow exploitation but most of them can be easily house ruled out. The disputed clairvoyance mechanic does have its role in the game and I (and our gaming group) didn't have problems with it.
I feel the box has a bit too many bits and pieces which half of them are unnecessary (and are either there to fill the punchboards or increase the price).

RATING: 8
+ Hidden Signs expansion (includes promo cards P1-3)
+ Secrets & Lies expansion (includes promo card P5)

Rating based on 2, 3, 6 and 7 players.

A cross between Dixit and Codenames, but I prefer picture clues over words and the longer narrative over having lots of multiple rounds, and the co-operative gameplay makes the game lively with plenty of tabletalk. I have played both with and without the clairvoyancy track, but for my own tastes I think it improves the game by creating a bit more group suspense, and would help alleviate potential alpha gamer problems (don't agree with someone? Just put your token down and leave it at that). Playing without it is still fine though, and is probably the way to go if playing with non-gamers. 

There's a fair amount of setup time needed, and since the ghost isn't supposed to talk to the other players it's definitely not at its best with 2.

Very temporary rating: only played once so far, so could easily change +/- 2. Need to play more times to try as ghost, see replayability, etc.

Much tougher than I thought it would be: 7 rounds, need to be wrong 5 times to fail so should be fine... yet 2 of the 5 psychics didn't make it (both were close though). We would have also collapsed on the final stage, since no one made it to 2 cards (I was closest at 6 points).

I was first psychic to make it (did it in only 4 rounds), but afterwards ghost mentioned how easy my cards were, but that for others seemed impossible. Could definitely see this feeling like too much randomness for ghost, but at least for psychic was pretty fun.

Doesn't pass muster as a co-operative game. There's no actual co-operation. Theme seems interesting but is thinly pasted and adds little to the game. Mechanically it's just a co-op version of Dixit with little innovation on display. The art is good and well designed for play, though.

Mysterium is a murder mystery game with a creative twist.  It's a co-operative game in which one player takes on the role of a ghost, and the other players are psychics trying to help the ghost solve his murder of about 100 years before.

This is done through the distribution of Dixit-like cards by the ghost player to the psychic players.  The cards represent "visions" that the psychics have.  They then interpret these visions, and use the clues within them to narrow down suspects, locations, and weapons a la Clue.

This is the only means of communication the ghost has with the psychics.  The psychics, on the other hand, can speak with each other to give each other aid.  They'll need it too, because there's only 7 turns for the proper suspects, locations, and weapons to get picked.  From them the actual murderer must be discovered.  If this doesn't happen the group loses and the ghost continues to be tied to this plane of reality.

Mysterium is a fantastic game!  The artwork is top notch, the theme is intriguing, and the gameplay is really fun.  I had high hopes for this one, and it met them all.  Couldn't recommend this more highly.

Best way to describe it would be Dixit with a little more game in it.

One player plays a ghost and gives clues to each player separately by using Dixit-like cards.

The clues match to a murderer, place where the murder happened and the murder weapon.

Pretty easy to explain and getting into. 
Really fun and intense, i enjoy this one a lot.

Added bonus for mixing this game with Dixit cards works like a charm!

The mixture of Dixit and Clue are great, this game has almost always been a hit with whoever I play with, and what makes it great is that playing with any new groups of people is always a different experience because of how varied the player interpretation of the cards are. I don't think I like the end game mechanic of determining the correct dream in the US release over the original.

[b]2016-04-30 6.0[/b] Impression after 1x 3p:
The type of deduction or clue giving is very similar to Dixit. However would much prefer to play Codenames that allows clue giver to come up with clues, rather than rely on randomness of card draw that also shows randomly composed, though beautifully drawn, art.

RATING: 8
As most have noted, its a mash-up of Dixit and Clue. More of a shared activity than a game, but wonderful interactions; almost requires more than 2 or 3 to meet its full potential. The journey of interpreting the dreams is the fun, the ending seems flat whether they succeed or fail. But the discussions and guessing are very entertaining and worthwhile.

I bought this game because I am always looking for meatier games for my social/drunk friends that aren't interested in games that require long term strategy or no interruptions. This looked about right, but I figured I would hate it since I dislike Dixit. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the dream cards are completely random and having different dreams for different investigators seems ridiculous. But trying to deduce what each player focuses on and listening to the players is actually pretty fun. If you like social deduction games, like Resistance, you may like it (even though this is nothing like Resistance).

I love the idea of this game, it is brilliant. At the first day we played it 6 times with family. However, if you have the same group, some cards create direct association for specific cards. For example, it is hard for us to associate one pink card with something else than kids room.

If you want to improve replayability, my advice would be to use Dix It cards for this game. You should do it at least time to time.

Great reworking of this game. The agree/disagree tokens actually make the game more enjoyable in my opinion without slowing it down. It gives some structure to the conversation about what the dreams mean that involves all players with all other players' turns. This game is just plain awesome!

I really thought I wouldn't like this game because Clue was always my favorite game growing up (the movie too), so I thought it was going to be lame in comparison in my mind. I am so glad I played anyway... It's an AMAZING game. I love the play-ability of this game. The game is always really different depending on who the ghost is. It really is a great game that I think doesn't get enough attention.

Mysterium is an excellent game that never fails to delight the players I introduce to it. No matter whether I'm playing the ghost or a clairvoyant I enjoy trying to solve the puzzle.

I like this system a lot but have found my enjoyment of this game slowly diminishing.  My first few plays were amazing and caused me to eagerly pre-order the US asmodee version.  My plays with various groups have been good, but maybe I'm just over the initial discovery of this cool system.  I also don't like the end game rules for the US version (I prefer to leave out the clairvoyance tokens completely) and don't feel that an acceptable official alternative is offered, even though several others have said the same.  Still, it's a neat system and a fun group game, but likely best during the first few plays.

I love the agony of being the ghost, and enjoy the comradery of trying to interpret the ghost's terrible clues.  It's a nice, easy to understand game that works well with game groups of different sizes and different experience levels.  After 6 games though I'm starting to feel like we need to add in an expansion just to have some different dream cards.  Still, overall a great game!

I'm not sure how often I would want to play, but after my first couple of games I am still in love.

It's refreshing to have a co-operative game that works very differently to any I have played before.

I've played with and without the clairvoyancy markers and I'm unsure which is more enjoyable. The short answer may be with more casual players, without, and more serious gamers, with.

Excellent deduction game, like Dixit and Clue(do) had a baby. Voting rules can get overly complicated, and not all mechanisms make sense within the theme. Really fun to deduce your case answers, though, and production/art values are phenomenal.

Category: Light Strategy - excellent theme and mechanics, makes a visual deduction game very interesting.  However, there could be a lot of down time when Ghost is giving out Vision cards, especially with a large group.  Also, the Clairvoyance tokens make the game more complicated than it needs to be, prefer to play without it.

Is this actually a game? I mean, I know the answer to the question and am just being a smartass, but seriously. What's the point? Game or not, I would not play it again, unless Candice Patton was the ghost and could only communicate by touching me.

I have had worse one-hour (ish) periods of my life. I've been to the dentist, and I sat through My Own Private Idaho. But I don't want to do any of those things again, and I will cut you if you try to make me rewatch MOPI.

There's not much to this, and there's certainly not much in the way of informed decision making as a psychic or as the ghost. "This is round, and, ooh, this is round, the ghost wants me to look for something round! Or maybe something red. Or maybe I'll just guess."

Needs more dinosaurs. Or a dinosaur.

A really cool co-operative deduction game in the veins of Dixit.

RATING: 4
This sounds like a great game on paper, with the same Social, Story-Telling and Guessing mechanics as Dixit, along a nod to the clue-gathering mystery solving mechanics of Clue Do.  

In practice, the game is great for the Investigator players, but is a little burdensome for the Ghost. I feel it's a little overrated because it fails to really fix the roles so the ghost can enjoy the game instead of just stressing out keeping the structure of the game all while trying to provide the correct clues. 

If you have one player in your group who loves being the Ghost, though, then this game would be a near perfect score. Otherwise, I find that it puts too much burden on the Ghost role to recommend. 

Worse, if you have Deception, well all I can say is Deception/CS Files is just better than this game in every way while scratching mostly the same itch. 

I don't get why this game is so popular but I feel that gamers should give this a pass in favor of better games like Dixit or Deception.

Social deduction game where players act as Psychics attempting to interpret vision cards (Dixit style artwork) in order to guess the details of a ghost's untimely demise.  
The ghost player must maintain a poker face, but luckily they have a large screen to hide their face behind if needed to avoid giving away any clues.  Components and rules are surprisingly fiddly for such a relatively simple game.

A very pleasant surprise. It’s practically a cooperative asymmetrical Dixit, which is a great thing! Gameplay makes sense, tension is just right, the experience is completely different if you’re playing the ghost or a psychic. Unfortunately it tends to get a bit slow. Highly recommended for Dixit crowds.

An excellent easy to teach, high player count, and beautiful game. The concept of this game is fun and easy and it even involves reading people. I love playing this with close friends and learning their way of thinking. I love playing this game with new friends and getting to know them through this process. The game is very hard though. Sometimes you can mathematically lose the game and just pack up early. That is a bummer. The cards for the game are beautiful and high quality and thick. this is a great hybrid between party games, coop, and strategy and I always enjoy pulling this out for the lighter gaming night.

Played 2p with the wife on easy and it wasn't SPECTACULAR

Played 5p and it fell flat once again

We were told it was like Dixit, which it is, but I think when you play with just two and you REALLY know the other person, it is pretty simple to beat

With 5, on medium, it was a struggle but that wasn't why it wasn't fun.  I think it just wasn't the type of game we were expecting, and in the end there are better coop games out there

This game just boils down to 'Cluedo', but with pictures, and isn't really engaging

That being said I have two suggestions:  

1)set this up away from the other players.  There is enough going on that its just easier to explain the game once it's set up.

2)Make sure that the board you're using is the correct one for the number of players you've got.  It's pretty easy to not notice that there is a difference in the amount of pips until after the fact.

Very much enjoy the game, and it's been a hit with the family. In essence, you build a system of shared communication through pictures. Dixit comes close, but Mysterium is more collaborative, and thus feels more like language creation. My only niggle is set up time. Organising everything can be a bit of a chore, and ideally requires muggins (me) to get everything in place and clear up. In short, a genuinely unique experience.

I love this game. I love the first edition - "Tajemnicze Domostwo" and I love this one as well. However, in my humble opinion the Asmodee's first English version is far better than the first one (Polish in my case). The graphics are a matter of taste, but I like them more. To me they are more... poetic. More mysterious and darker too. And the components of the game are fabulous. I just love the Intuition Tokens and that broken clock... Props to the designers of the box for a great inside. Everything in its place.

First played this at a local gaming group, and my wife and I loved it. Purchased it as soon as we could afterwards. Our daughter is similarly enamoured with it and thankfully never wants to play Cluedo (aka Clue) again. The gaming group's ghost player was incredible - we've never had such success as mediums without her - so make sure your group has a good ghost player to maximize the enjoyment of this game. I suspect it will fall flat in a group with a bad ghost player.

This would be much higher if it wasn't for the endgame. I feel that the Polish rule set for the endgame is the best, the English version is just convoluted and stupid...entirely unnecessary.

Overview:
Mysterium is a cooperative game where the players work together to solve a murder mystery and set free the ghost of the murder victim within 7 rounds. It involves unspoken player interaction, and can be surprisingly deep while still appealing to families with gamers of all ages.

Summary:
A beautifully designed interactive playing experience with tight gameplay mechanics that is fun for the whole family! I bring it to all of my friends board game nights, and even to family events, and everyone loves playing it.

Art?
Great! From abstract art, to depicting potential murderers, and overall atmosphere, the art is high quality, fits the game, and enhances the experience. 

Quality?
The cards and other materials are all of high quality. Cards get touched and passed around a lot and hold up well.

Theme?
The theme is not particularly profound, but is fun. You can play a whole game without thinking about the thematic goal, but the art helps to bring it to your mind occasionally, and a heavy theme was honestly just not needed. 

One almost weakness (more like a missed opportunity maybe?) is that the game developed out story for each "psychic", and you choose color corresponding to one psychic when you begin the game, but the psychic you pick does not really matter. Personally, I would love to see an expansion where the psychics are given minor unique gameplay abilities, but it would likely be tough to fit into the already tight gameplay. Just a way I think the theme could influence the gameplay more.

Gameplay?
The gameplay of this game is simple, yet fantastic. One player plays the ghost - the murder victim. They pass cards of very abstract art to the other players - who play psychics. The ghost tries to use those cards to indicate to the players who the murderer, murder location, and murder weapon might be. Players playing psychics work together to interpret the card art because the ghost cannot speak. Its an interactive experience that can incorporate shy players and outgoing players. 

Playing the ghost vs psyshcics is a very different experience, which adds a lot of variety to the gameplay. The ghost is a stressful experience - in a good way - because you only get 7 cards to choose from. You do not always have the "perfect" abstract art card, so you sometimes have to use multiple cards over multiple rounds and hope the players pick up on patterns. As they say, "its all up to interpretation" and that makes the game a lot of fun.

One weakness is that the success of a good chunk game lies in the ghost's hands. If you have someone who "overthinks" or tries to be too literal, the psychics will likely have a very tough time guessing the right cards, and that can be frustrating. I had that happen one time. It's a rare occurrence though I think. 

Other issues are a lot of potential down time, depending on how long the ghost takes to issue cards. This if often due to a strange timing mechanic meant to pressure psychics into interpreting clues quickly, but that has no actually stress since the ghost can take as long as they like giving out clues before the timer starts. We just stopped using the timer to be honest.

Replayability?
A lot! Switching between roles adds a lot of diversity, and the combination of cards in the ghosts hand can change up how any single murder, location, or weapon needs to be communicated. I have played it many times, and my family of "traditional gamers" (i.e. "the farther we will go is Catan") is very willing to play this game when I suggest it - and they even bring it up on their own sometimes! *cue the angel choir*

One replay issue is that once a card pops up in several games, you begin to have an "insider" understanding of what clues the card is good for, so adding new players to the game - especially as the ghost - is likely essential for long-term replayability.

We played this in a games cafe and struggled with setup as the game was not put away as well as it might have been. Not he games fault but it did take a while which was a bit annoying.

The game itself was pretty straightforward and ended up being really easy to the point that there was no real challenge. Both investigators found their person, weapon and place pretty easily and we guessed the correct identity at the end with no real problem at all.

Note that we played on 'easy' level which seemed a fair enough place to start as it was the first game for two of us while the ghost was already a one game veteran. That said, I don't think that playing at a harder level would really have enhanced the experience.

So anyway, we played the game out and that was that. Wouldn't really want to play again and definitely wouldn't purchase. Not my thing at all.

Cooperative Dixit. Feels a bit too luck dependent. And there's a lot of downtime while the ghost decides what cards to give out. Ultimately something of a disappointment.

A lavish production of a pretty good game; this a box of beautiful and evocative components. The game itself is a  co-operative, visual, clue-giving & guessing game in the same class as Codenames & Concept. Like those games, it plays quickly and is fun for about 20 minutes (or 2 plays). On the downside, it takes as long to set-up as it does to play. Nevertheless, it is a great clue-guessing game and it gives players a rich thematic experience.

In Mysterium arbeiten die Spieler zusammen, um einen geheimnisvollen Mord aufzuklären. Ein Spieler nimmt dabei die Rolle des Geists ein, während jeder andere Spieler ein Medium ist, der durch die Visionen des Geistes, den Mord rekonstruieren soll. Diesgeschieht durch sehr einfallsreiche und phantasievolle Karten, die der Geist den einzelnen Media zuordnet. Dabei darf der Geist natürlich nicht sprechen und somit auch keine Hinweise geben. Die Motive der Karten sind wirklich faszinierend, da sie so viel Interpratationsspielraum haben, da die Gedanken des Geistes nicht so leicht nachvollziehbar sind.Mysterium ist ein schönes Spiel mit tollem Spielmaterial und um Längen besser, als z.B. Dixit.

A bit more lavish than the original version, with some added mechanics, which make it a bit more game-like. You can take those out if you want, but I think they are a good add-on and improve the game. I also like the overall visual style better in this one. 

Mysterium replaces Dixit for me, at least for the time being. The ghost is more fun to play than the detectives, but it's nice to fluctuate between them. After 10+ plays the base game is starting to lose its legs, so I'd probably need the expansion to milk it some more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The concept is cool. The artwork is cool. The game flows super smoothly. Everybody usually has a blast, including the ghost, and they want to play it over and over again. 

That has not been beneficial for me, as I now tend to see all the little negative sides of this game, and I don't have as much fun playing it. 

Aside from the tedious (albeit cool) set-up, if you play this game with the same people you will eventually get the same combinations of clues/ cards, thus making the game feel repetitive. Also, you really have to play with the right people, or the game might be over in 20 minutes due to lack of discussion.

To me this is an excellent and well-executed concept, and it often bring people together providing a fun time, but I might have gotten tired of it already. I will probably be happy to play it again with expansions though.

-Funny
-Theme, that's also similar to the well known game Clue

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Long set-up
-The amount of components might scare new gamers away
-The need to explain rules while you're the ghost makes the game lose it's immersion

I want to play this a little more (and with more people), but it was pretty funny so far. Set-up takes a while though, which I did not expect when buying this game.

This is kinda a problem for what's supposed to be a gateway game. "Hey guys, wanna play a game? Don't worry it's really easy..." *proceeds to grab dozens of components and shuffle multiple decks*. This is also why it's been so hard to get to the table.

Also, you aren't supposed to speak as the ghost, which is kinda hard when you also need to explain the rules. And letting someone else be the ghost is not really gateway level easy anymore.

However, it is the only cooperative board game I know of that's easy to teach and not prone to quarterbacking (unlike Pandemic, so I have heard).

To me this game is fun jaunt into a world with a mystery, who killed our ghost? The artwork is gorgeous and fits right into the atmosphere the game wants to create. It may not be the game for everyone, as sometimes the dream cards can be a bit too confusing. But for me, it hits all the notes I love.

New game to my collection, maybe played a handful of times. Takes a second to remember how to set up, and I can see the game starting to be spoiled after enough play throughs with the same group of people (people start seeing how you think)... BUT, for now, its one of the most thematic and engrossing games I have and we enjoy every play through. Art is awesome.

RATING: 6
Based on my plays of the app. The game is fine. I found it fun for the first couple of plays. There are good and bad things about being the investigators or the ghosts, but ultimately it suffers from what I like to call the Pictionary Effect. Basically, if you do a bad job at giving or deciphering clues, the other person will blame you for it. A lot of times the ghost just doesn't have any good cards to play though, which helps to facilitate this negative reaction. I will say that I enjoyed this more than Deception: Murder in Hong Kong, though it has far less replay value in comparison. Deception has tons and tons of different cards, whereas in Mysterium you'll see most of what it offers by the 3rd or 4th game. The difference, however, is that I like having to make connections between the clues and the guilty cards in this game a lot more since they usually have little to nothing in common with each other. This is something I believe is done better here than in games like Dixit. I think the game is alright for what it is, but it isn't something I'd want to play all that often.

It's a good mystery game and the mechanics are fun, the game art is beautiful, some of it's cards would make amazing paintings to hang on the wall, but after a few games some cards get nicknamed and are easily associated with the it's objective, this can however be solved with a few interesting twists on the rules.

Is this a game or not? Very inventive idea where a game master (ghost) use dreamlike clues to tell the players about a murder. May be too much guesswork and risk of downtime if many players but OK if in the right mood.

RATING: 7
What makes this game is the art. It's pretty straightforward: there are only so many dead people, rooms, and weapons, so if you don't solve each clue in order right away, process of elimination works. The art tho. Every card is complex, often with stories tucked away in juxtapositions you don't even notice until the second or third play. To unlock the joy of this game, you really need a good ghost: If the person playing ghost can make the best use of limited, very dream-weird and beautiful cards (think Dixit) given the skills and tendencies of the other players, it's going to be fascinating. What limits this game is that you can't really get into your 'part' (unless you really dig race caricature). It would be so much more fun to argue over why your clue matches your answer if you could pretend, guilt-free, to have a divination method (clairvoyance, crystals, cards, whatever) you can describe mysteriously to other players. Discussing whether the ghost meant you to notice matching hues on your clue card and in the card one of the people/places/weapons from which you're supposed to choose, or whether the mist-shrouded orchard on your clue card means hedge clippers were the murder weapon or that the weapon was made of wood, is fun - but it would be more fun if the player piece you'd been assigned wasn't a magic-jewel-ring-wearing Arab or an I-Ching reading Chinese woman or one of the other equally squicky options. Meh. Make up different characteristics and backstories, put a heavily top-shaded bright lamp on the table (and give the ghost an LED reading light) and turn off all the other lights, cue up some storm sounds or unsettling music (try Charles Ives!), and let the art bemuse and absorb you while the ghost struggles (with a fairly small hand) to send the clearest dream-imagery to help you find your solution. Definitely better among imaginative types and with at least 3 players.

The game is beautiful and I really want to like it more... but after a few plays with both 2 and 4 players, I still can’t get myself to like it.  There’s something lacking and the end game is too random.  Also the limitation with the cards - once a card’s been used with the same group it will become repetitive with subsequent game plays.

This is a wonderful family game, great for children, and with a little role-play can really come to life. The rules could be more clearly expressed, but a couple of playthroughs are enough to get things understood. With a playtime of 30-40 minutes including set-up if it's done efficiently, this is a good after-dinner game to share with loved ones, and  rewards frequent play.

I read this has more replay than Dixit but still limited replay without expansions (and the box likely cant fit expansion materials based on what Ive seen). So probably avoid getting this. Also, it may have less dream/artwork cards than the European edition (Tajemnicze Domostwo)

Decent assymmetric coop with fairly reasonable theme. The downtime is a bit too high as the ghost decides though, and I do wonder if replay will be limited by the cards. (I.e. you start getting repeat patterns of cards pointing to other cards). The setup also took a fair by of time.

Part of me kinda wants to get this to round out my collection. Its one of the few types of party games I dont have, it has a murder mystery and decent ambiance, and it scales to 7 decently. But the flaw above are too great, especially the replayability fears and high downtime.

Das Spielprinzip ist hervorragend und in der richtigen Runde eine Spaßgranate. Lediglich die unpraktischen Punkte- und Weißsagungsmarker gehen irgendwann auf die Nerven, außerdem lernt die Spielgruppe Tipps irgendwann auswendig, worunter der Langzeitspielspaß leiden könnte. Für mich ist Mysterium das bessere Dixit. Thematisch ist es besser aufgemacht, die Karten interessanter und das kooperative Spielsystem spaßiger.

The basic mechanism is great. You have to have quite a fertile imagination for this game to work, though. It's very nice to see people having all kinds of theories about the ghost's messages and it makes the game fun. People with very little imagination should stay away from it: not only the game doesn't work for them, but they tend to ruin the mood of the game.

My problem: the final guessing mechanism feels very awkward. It does encourage the mediums to guess better, but it is quite frustrating and not very rewarding, especially for the hard-working ghost.

A very interesting party-style game. Our group seems to like it pretty well. I am not sure how many plays the base game alone will have. Once you "learn" the cards and can affix certain descriptors to them, it seems like it will get easier and easier. More plays are needed to test this theory.

I had a lot of fun playing this game, but compared to other strategic or theme-based rp-games, this game has pretty simple, but easy to learn mechanics. Which makes it perfect to play with unexperienced boardplayers or the family. In this comparision-group, the game is just fantastic. You can also play an easy round to end the gameboard evening with your experienced friends. I can highly recommend this game in terms of price for what you get, beginnerbased gameplay and fun overall, but when i can, i would ever prefer a very good strategic game like scythe, blood rage or theme-based like eldritch horror, mansions,of madness or zombicide.

Mysterium is what you get when you mash together Clue and Dixit, tying the games together with a theme of a ghost trying to identify it's murderer to the members of a séance. It sounds like an interesting concept, but the execution is terrible!

First of all, why is everyone trying to identify different people, places, and weapons? How many times was this ghost murdered? Oh, only the final clues indicate the killer? Then what was the point of identifying a bunch of not-murderers?

Secondly, using dreamy Dixit imagery is a nonsensical way to indicate the facts of the murder. Clue cards should be more grounded in reality. It would be easy to make hodgepodge images without resorting to outright fantasy and would be better thematically.

Thirdly, why does the game have to be played in stages; People, then Places, and finally Things? Why can't guesses be made out of order and clues given to players be persistent, instead of getting wiped after each correct guess?

Were all these issues addressed, the result would be a 2-player game, which would likely lower the developer's profit margin, but it would improve gameplay greatly. Mysterium's asymmetrical design with the current player count makes for long delays waiting for cards to be chosen for everyone, which puts a frustrating amount of pressure on the Ghost player.

Apparently the Clairvoyance tokens were an addition to the English release of Mysterium. Why? Was it necessary for someone to be crowned King of the Cooperators? Wasn't winning the game enough?

Oh, and the components suck, especially the Clairvoyance scoring tokens. I've never seen a smaller chunk of cardboard intended for gameplay. The dividers for the table are pointless. If it is that important that cards be placed in specific areas, yet you're not willing to provide a board, then include a roll-up mat of felt or neoprene. Finally, the box insert is an impediment. The owner of the game I played had to resort to lifting the insert out to store components underneath to get the box lid to fit.

Thankfully I didn't manage to trade for this piece of garbage in the last math trade. Bullet dodged!

Mysterium serait pourrait-on dire la version évoluée du célèbre jeu "Dixit". L'ambiance est primordiale pour savourer au maximum cette perle :-). Les règles sont simples et les parties ne ressemblent pas vraiment. On peut passer d'une partie où on va en baver autant côté fantôme avec le tirage des visions que côté médium pour comprendre le fantôme à une partie où tout roule à merveille de tout côté :-). Il est vraiment agréable de voir comment chacun à sa perception des choses. Les illustrations de toute beauté y sont pour beaucoup. C'est un jeu riche que je recommande vivement, même aux amateurs de jeux de société de manière générale. Même s'il est possible de jouer à 2 ou 3, cela reste quand même beaucoup plus fun (notamment au niveau des règles) à partir de 4 joueurs.

Very interesting game. I have never played Dixit, the group was composed of non players, average players and heavy players; and it was not a problem, we all enjoyed a lot the game.
To play as a Medium is more fun, but to play as a Ghost is more challenging, so both experiences are very different. I liked more to be the ghost.
I also think that needs desperately an expansion with more cards

Fundamental flaw of this compared to Dixit, is it is somewhat limiting to creativity. It almost like Funemployed versus CAH. In Funemployed you impart your own creativity to the cards when telling your story, in CAH you let the cards do all the talking. Mysterium has this problem too, because the ghost can't talk it must rely totally on the ability of a random hand of cards to impart meeting. While this is a neat concept in theory, in practice it makes for a less thinky experience than Dixit.  Still that might be the mood you are in, and its certainly an awesome thematic game with great components and creepy art. But it seems to have a little less soul, or legs than Dixit.

A beautiful game that captures the mood and is just right for Halloween.
The game comes with a link to the website that allows you to play background music.
In this game, players are trying to solve a very old murder.
A mystery so old, that players must receive clues from a ghost who can only be reached on Halloween night.
The ghost and players are working to cooperatively solve the murder before 7 hours are up.

The ghost player will be giving clues to the other psychic players in the form of Dixit style cards.
The psychic players will be looking at basic cards showing who could have done it, what location and what weapon was used.
As the psychics receive clue cards from the ghost, they can narrow down their choices.
The complexity in this game comes in the fact that the ghost can only send clues in the form of vague images and only with the cards he currently has available to give as clues.

I think this is a very clever game.  We continue to play with a fast and loose rule set depending on who we play with -- and our rules tend more toward the original rules than the English reprint.  We've found that large groups aren't as much fun to play with and prefer to keep it too fewer people.

RATING: 6
Very well produced game, beautiful artwork and components but unspectacular gameplay.  Being the ghost is very demanding and overstayed it's welcome.  Found myself wanting to pass the job of clue giver to another player, like in Dixit.  Unlike the verbal clues in Dixit, the ghost is giving clues based on a 7 card hand of picture cards.  Sometimes (and seemed like too many times) I was forced just to give a lousy  clue.   there were good times during play and fun to see investigators get excited when they guess successfully.  set up seemed more difficult than it should be.

Same comment as the original really (follows below). I like the addition of the bets on who's right and wrong, leading to a variation of the end game which is fine (but not altogether enough to warrant an upgrade from the original), but a lot of the English version is otherwise Clancy of the Overchrome with no substantial gaming (or art) difference from the original version.
Original comment: Interesting but without being fun per se, being a constant analysis of how the spirit player might be trying to link two pictures together; and when you can see multiple possible links, taking a punt at which is the most likely. After a few games you get to see the same cards again, and remembered analyses of previous cards come into play creating a meta game of link patterns. Which can only be advantageous to the players, but it seems like a creation of "cheats" which circumvents the point of play, so I'm not sure how much replay the game's going to have within a same group of players. At the least it creates a nice social experience of shared discussion and contemplation which gives it a different feel from other games in my collection so it'll probably find a permanent spot.

A good party game that usually goes over well. I have had it bomb a few times when the group just didn't get into it but I blame that on the new mechanics in the Asmodee version, which I no longer use. It is best when everyone is helping out each other to figure out the clues.

Clue, but good!  A really strong co-op where you're striving to solve a murder using only pictures for clues.  One player takes the role of the ghost (who was murdered) that's handing out pictures to the other players, who are psychics.  This creates a Clue-like combination of person, location, and item that the ghost then uses to try leading people to the right combination to solve the murder.  Fast (once you've learned it), engaging, occasionally frustrating (this picture relates to that how?), but thoroughly fun.

I loved Mysterium when the game began. I was so excited. The concept of the game is so cool. By the time I had gotten my 5th card from the ghost that was the color blue and the card I was supposed to pick was the color blue, I was checked out. Some people might say that this was the fault of the ghost. I don't think it is. Our ghost was a good, smart player. We have played many games with him. He was just not getting good cards that conveyed our cards, because the game randomly selects everything for you. Then the worst frustration was helping pick a card for someone else based on symbolism and she was sure it was another card due to the color. Well it turned out she was right, the color was right on the money. If you would like a game where all you do is match colors on cards, this is the game for you. If not, just play Deception: Murder in Hong Kong instead.

This game combines the nice art cards of Dixit with a deduction style game, giving it more meaning and more body than Dixit. That's a big plus for me, since I think Dixit is quite boring. The game plays well, is very engaging. There is some downtime when the ghost selects the different clues though. Putting down the true/false markers and the score track feel a bit superfluous to me, because it's a co-op game, but that's just a minor note. And finally, it's a great production; not just the beautiful art on the cards, but also the ghost screen, the turn-clock, the player orbs, etc.

I love co-ops and mysteries, so this was a perfect blend of the two.  I didn't care for Dixit, yet found this game to be very interesting and straightforward with the clues.

The end game was a little off, coming to a silent poll of which set people thought was correct.  One may want to use the Polish rules instead at this phase.

This is a good and mellow game.  Make sure you have a good ghost as that can make or break the game.  Great artwork.  Can be tense sometimes too. Great game. 
Fun tip:  knocking to dnote correctness of guesses is very atmospheric.  I provide an eerie white mask for the ghost to minimize facial expressions and to add to ambience,

I played Mysterium some times before I started logging plays here.

Mysterium is a really interesting gateway game, it is Clue + Dixit and a bit of the occult. The cards are beautiful like in Dixit, but with a bit of darkness, like if Tim Burton in the 90's designed Dixit.

It is engaging, although the las tbit is kind of clunky, and anticlimatic, but without it it would just be even more.

There's a bit of a difficult thing, teach the Ghost, is kind of a double feature of teaching, you have to teach the mediums while teaching the ghost, it is best that the ghost has played before as a medium.

Really funny. The given backstory makes no sense - you are all trying to guess the murderer of the ghost, but the ghost actually gives you a number separate stories first, then gives you clues out of those? I actually ended up making my own backstory there, But the art and the cooperative gameplay are amazing, if your group has lateral thinkers (that aren't too lateral...)

Never thought that I would like a game were a Dixit-element is involved :-) But then again I like deduction games. 

After reading the rules I thought the role of the ghost would be the best for me, but after 1 play I'm not so convinced of that :s

only played 4 player as the ghost (and host).  

Harder on my second run as one player was leading and not matching to my views... lucky draw made the game easier so by elimination it still worked.

All enjoyed it, although i didn't really see excitement on the player's side, so I guess they'd probably rate it a bit lower.

Looked lovely and I enjoyed this. Ruined for me on my first playthrough (as ghost) by drunken player who announced it 'boring' and 'dont get it'.

Didnt think I'd get to play it with this or my other group again so sold it.

Update: Covalence may be a better option

From what I've seen and heard, my desire to buy this beautiful looking and inviting narrative is nearly being laid to rest. There are nails in its coffin: the impression it is initially guesswork rather than deduction; downtime (he, he) while waiting for clues if the clairvoyants aren't talkative; and the arrival of Deception in Hong Kong (which is shorter but best with 6-7, whereas Mysterium is best with 4-5). Besides Codenames in co-op mode is a similar and far less restrictive communication. Yet Mysterium may be more inclusive for younger families and where vocabulary isn't a strong point.

Still, I wouldn't turn down an opportunity to try it out, to see if my hunch is dead on....

Outstanding game-easy to learn and play.One minor knock against it, and i is minor, is that with multiple play-throughs, tendencies become apparent and some people, especially couples, can speed through the game with little problem. For example, it quickly became apparent that I was drawn to colors on the cards rather than content.

My husband was the one who really wanted this game, I thought it only sounded "meh." Turns out, I was completely wrong and it's a goddamn blast to play. We usually play 3-4 games in a night, so lots of people get a turn to be the ghost. Great for kids and adults. Ding: setup is fiddly for being such a simple game, be sure to rope in everyone to make it go faster.

Basically Dixit meets Clue.

Very cool game, but the final round mechanic leaves so much up to chance that I have to dock it significantly. The more players you have, the more likely your team will lose in the final round.

If the end of the game had some tweaks, this could be addressed. For example, instead of "you only get one try," let the players go until the clock runs out of time, like the first phase.

Mysterium combines elements of Dixit and Clue into a cooperative whodunit that takes less than an hour (with proper focus). The artwork ranges from awe-inducing cuteness to some extreme trippiness. One player fills the role of the ghost of a person who was murdered, while all other players (up to 6) are psychics trying to communicate with the dead to solve the crime.
The ghost silently gives clues, in the form of cards with artwork on them to help the players identify who killed him, where it happened, and what the weapon was. The psychics must go in order of who, where, and finally what. Each of them has individual cards that they are trying to identify. In each category there are a number of cards to select from, the number of cards changes based on difficulty and number of players. Psychics get 7 rounds to determine their who, what, and where. If any psychic fails, the game is lost.
After the players have each identified the who, what, and where assigned to them, you enter the final round. Everyone’s set of cards creates the final line-up. The ghost now needs to choose three clues from her hand hand to get all of the psychics to solve the crime by having them all select the correct answer.
The game has a concept of clairvoyance. At the end of the game, clairvoyance indicates the number of cards a psychic gets to see before making a guess. There are two ways to gain clairvoyance. First, you get tokens to bet on whether you think the other psychics have made right or wrong guesses. If you’re correct you move up one on the clairvoyance track. The second way is to have extra rounds left after solving your individual who, where and what. You get one point of clairvoyance per remaining round. The amount of clairvoyance needed two or three cards changes depending on the number of players in the game.
Tips for playing:
Psychics need to voice their interpretations out loud and work together while the Ghost should be keeping track of what players latch on to from the visions. In the final round these will be key for picking cards to nudge players in the right direction.
Don’t forget that the Ghost is a player when considering how many cards should be displayed per section. Forgetting that leads to using too few cards (and too few clairvoyancy tokens) for the difficulty you’re trying for.
Also don’t forget that the Ghost can give one or more cards to each psychic. We overlooked that detail in the rules.
The ghost gets to choose which group of cards to nudge the players towards in the final round. For added difficulty, choose which group you need to nudge them towards at random!
If someone starts making fun of someone’s interpretation, or of them getting a guess wrong, shut that down right away. The fun depends on people being able to make open guesses.

In order to familiarize ourselves with the rules, we first played with two players. In two player mode, the psychic player ends up playing two psychics. Although we both had fun, Mysterium is definitely not at its strongest as a two player game.. Multiplayer mode allows you to collaborate with the rest of the psychics, in two player mode you only get to talk with yourself. You also don’t use clairvoyance in two player mode.
This is a great game for children, we played with three adults and four children aged 5 through 11. The recommended age for players is 10+ but the kids liked working together. Our youngest player got help from the older kids but still contributed meaningfully on his own. With a young group, it’s useful to play on easy mode so that process of elimination provides some additional help. We also didn’t use clairvoyance when playing with the kids to simplify the rules and we allowed them to discuss the options in the final round.
We played several times with clairvoyance. Mysterium is a lot of fun as a large group game. Psychics remain in engaged in the game because of the cooperative nature. Even if one person doesn’t need to be actively guessing, they will be interested in helping the rest of the group make their guesses.
One gotcha that we encountered: We played six games before realizing that the ghost can give one or more clue cards to each player per round. We accidentally played on extremely hard mode for many of our games. We recommend giving at most three cards to a single person to keep the raven mechanic meaningful.
After five games, we found that we wanted more variety in the cards we had to choose from. Fortunately the hidden signs expansion provided exactly that variety. Mysterium is a great group game with high replay value. It has become a go-to party game for us.

I enjoy this a whole lot, but, having played it about a half-dozen times, I have had to adjust a few things. Critically, if you have a full house of players, then, being the Spirit/Ghost can take WAY too long as you try to figure out the right vision to pass on. This can leave the players really bored. So, I have introduced a rule to use the sand-timer with the game as a time limit on how long the Spirit/Ghost can take to put the visions together for the players. One other thing: I have never played with the +/- betting system for visions (which would influence how many clues the players can see at the end of the game). Even not using those, the players have never -- in 6 games -- been able to figure out the correct murderer/location/item.

I've only played a couple games so far, and I think I still need to understand the rules a little better. It is playable with 2 or 3 people, but it seems it would be much more challenging and fun when you get more people into the game.

Dixit with a theme...I love it.

The mechanisms work well to involve everyone in a truly cooperative system.  Bad communication between a ghost and player is penalized, good communication rewarded...yet those having problems can still progress thanks to help of their teammates and clairvoyAnce tokens.

It would be nice if setup was a little more streamlined...it's the one hurdle for getting different players to play the ghost.

Spectacular game.  I enjoy the art style a bit more in the original version, hence the 0.1 difference.  If you've heard anything about this game, I'm sure it's been, "It's like Clue meets Dixit!"  If you haven't, then, it's like Clue meets Dixit!

I'm not a huge fan of the theme of this game, but after playing Deception Murder in Hong Kong, I really have no desire to ever play this game again. If I am at a group, and they say, "Do ya'll want to play Mysterium?" and everyone agrees I'm sure I will enjoy playing it. But I don't really have any desire to find a game of it being played.

Play as the ghost or a number of psychics. Be prepared to send out or decipher cryptic messages in the form of beautiful artwork as you collectively attempt to figure out the Ghost's murderer. This for me, is Dixit with an actual goal. The cards are beautiful and are open to interpretation; that it makes for great conversation around the gaming table. Great components, and game-play.

This is a great game with beautiful artwork.  I personally have always enjoyed playing it when I've been able to get it to the table.  The biggest drawback I've found is getting people that are willing to play.  I know my wife and friends that I normally game with have all given it a try and have been reluctant to jump back in.  For them, the abstract nature of the clues and trying to piece it together didn't do much for them.  If you've got willing people, I would definitely give this a try.

One side note, when I have played we didn't use the clairvoyance track and played it purely co-op similar to the original game.  It just worked better this way with my group and keeping them playing, so I can't comment on how well that addition works with the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Deduction game with a very strong theme. Simply dimming the lights adds a lot to the dark, ominous atmosphere. Fully cooperative but the ghost player is not allowed to speak or give non-verbal gestures. Plays up to seven and I do not think playing with the max number would hurt the pacing too much. Would take longer but probably wouldn't feel too long. A fairly deep game that isn't heavy with mechanics but still can be largely dependent on your group. Art is great and the shield for the ghost is well crafted. Can take awhile to set up but the experience is worth it.

I was extremely frustrated by this game. 99% of the time, we were talking bullshit. We were making weak assumptions about what the ghost meant, which sometimes turned out to be false EVEN WHEN WE CHOSE CORRECTLY. The game simply doesn't give the ghost a good enough system through which to relay information, and thus it devolves to guesswork and unrelated rants and ramblings. It bored me more than Dixit, which says a lot.

Very surprised by this. After initial hype settled I became very skeptical with this. Especially after hearing some not so great reviews and friends talking about it as a meh experience.

BUT, I really like this game! I like pretty much everything about the game. Sure, there's a lot of downtime with a slow ghost, but usually we'll just chat in between rounds.
One minor gripe - more with the players than the actual game - I hate small comments on the card we're dealt from the ghost like "Try not to put too much into this" or "These are bad cards". Whatever happened to a SILENT ghost?

I played the Polish edition of Mysterium a lot before this one was released. I did not think it could be topped, but some small tweaks have made this one my favorite. I really like the new vote tokens and the eay they shape the final guessing round. Definitely added boost of tension in a game that normally just sizzles out without much challenge.

Either way, Mysterium is a unique abstract party game that will always find room in my collection.

I love how this game plays on the inclination to see patterns and symbols in ostensibly unrelated things. When the players understand what the ghost is trying to communicate, it really feels like a psychic connection.

Turn the lights down low, put a creepy soundtrack on, and this one is great fun.

Dixit meets Clue. One players been murdered and is trying there damnedest to communicate with the other players to wrangle up enough evidence to put that nefarious hoodlum behind bars. Using abstract visual cards they give vague clues in the hopes that you can make connections with the person place and instrument of murder.

The clue-giving/guessing part of the game is fun. The rest of it not so much, at least for our family. It feels like a lot of extra mechanics are tacked on to turn it into a "real" game but we enjoy just trying to get everyone to guess all their items. This turns it into Codenames: Dixit edition but that's apparently what we were looking for.

Por um lado, é melhor que o Dixit, pois dá alternativas melhores à falta de cartas que representem a ideia que deve ser passada. Por outro, me pareceu complicado demais para o que é. A partida que joguei foi muito boa, mas suspeito que nem todas seriam assim.

I just don't get how this game has become so popular.

A ghost tries to use Dixit cards to tell a bunch of seers about a murder case. Oh it's so creative! Not really. All the ghost can do is pick the least crappy card, and all the seers can do is hope to make the right guess. Not much creativity there.

I'm a much bigger fan of the way the cards are used in Dixit, where you actually get to be creative, making up crazy clues, that can guide the other players on to your twisted train of thought. That part is missing in Mysterium and it just makes it really dull experience.

Fun cooperative deduction game. However, playing the ghost can get very stressful, especially if luck isn't in your favor.  Generally, games are more disconnected than in other board games since there is a lot of waiting time: many players are often checking their phones while waiting for the ghost to give visions. Still a pretty fun game, nonetheless. 

Can be played in the right circumstances. Will probably be played more if setup is easier.

Excelent game. Nice to be the phantom, nice to be a player. Not too much difficult on the easy setting and the art is gorgeous. Let's see how much replayability this game offers in the long run.
Update: Removed half a point, an AP phantom can bog down the game SO MUCH.
Up2: Another half point. The cards seems to repeat a lot, so it can start to be used in some metagame fashion. The expansion seems to help, but it's so expensive for a bunch of cards. Start a dixit collection to play it does not seem like a good solution...

It´s a very special game, something like a mixture of "Dixit" and "Cluedo", but better than both.
IMHO, also the game is in the group of games like "Érase una vez" ("Once upon a time") and so, because it´s kind of a "party game" where imagination and creativity is one of the most important thing. It works well with 2 players and with 4 players, although the play experience is quite different (better with 4). Its artwork and graphics design are just beautiful!

Mysterium is a really unique and fun game in which players are playing psychics that have been called to a haunted mansion where a ghost has been haunting the estate ever since his/her murder. The players are there to decipher the dreams that the ghost gives them throughout the night, in order to find the killer, the murder weapon and the location of the murder so the ghost can finally rest in peace.


Pros: entertaining cooperative game,  strong and fun theming, Gorgeous artwork and component quality,Quick gameplay.  High amounts of player interaction, accomadates large player counts.

Cons: Best with larger player counts,  can be difficult to win.no real strategy game play,

This is a great, fun game, but the only reason it's not as highly ranked as Dixit, is the fact that there are two separate experiences in this game. Being the ghost is fun and interesting, but ultimately, it's not the same not being able to be a part of the group. I'm only one play in, but the game isn't quite as good Dixit. It's still a LOT of fun, just not in the same realm of Dixit. Ultimately, we'd just rather play Dixit.

Prefer Dixit. Ghost player gets screwed if the cards aren't useful for giving clues with. I think Dixit does a better job, since the clue-giving doesn't have to be done by one player all the time, and you don't have a situation where you have clue cards that don't fit the cards you want to tell players are the right cards to select. Maybe the game would work better with clue cards that fit better with the other cards.

This game is fun and different, with very attractive components and art that is tasteful and very functional for the game.  I think anybody who is interested in the concept should definitely try to play it.  One small thing that irked me is that the theme actually doesn't really make sense, something that is only evident when you become familiar with the rules.  Why does the ghost send an incorrect vision to most of the mediums, only guiding one of them towards the truth?  Worse, how can it be that the ghost decides which of these series of visions is correct, and does this only at the final round?!

The endgame is a bit rulesy and anti-climactic, but the main mechanism is a lot of fun both as ghost and guesser. Having a bad hand of dream cards as the ghost really forces you to get creative, only to often watch the investigators completely misinterpret your clues. A great look at how we interpret art and intent.
I think that I really hate the endgame, though. I can't decide.

Wow, this game takes Dixit and makes a real game out of it. A asymmetric co-op with one as a clue giver and the others trying to figure out the clues as a group. Only one person does not like it who comes to my game nights. Very attractive and engaging game!

Based on 1 play only.  I never got a chance to play Dixit, but that didn't bother me since it was more of a party game format.  This takes that and adds of bit of flare. 

The game plays quickly and I definitely felt ready for another go right afterwards.  I can't imagine it would be great after a few dozen games, but it is something I'd suggest to others looking for a different co-op experience.

I felt like I was missing something the whole time. I'm not sure why this is so well rated. Everything was so random and felt meaningless. Everything was wild guesses and the mechanics at the end of the game made no sense.

Apart from the thematic disconnect between the Scottish setting and the Parisian dreams, I found this to be a significant improvement on the original, largely down to the end-game, which is better structured.

Playing it at all frequently with the same group, I think you would be likely to build quick shorthands for many of the cards (eg the mouse and cheese means the chef), though that's not necessarily a flaw. Adding in Dixit cards would probably help with this.

1 part Clue, 1 part Dixit. This game will take the right group of players to enjoy - Not great for a raucous party, both in theme and in play style, but really has some cool design.

The only problem I see is that the numbered cards should use different cardbacks for persons, places, and things, which would make setup much easier. Also, the manual shows the psychic's location cards as square, while in reality they are the same standard shape as everything else.

RATING: 7
The ghostly mood this game can create is terrific as it emulates a seance with one player as the ghost giving the other players 'visions' to help solve a murder.  It seems to get better with higher player counts, as a 3 player game was definitely more interesting than just Jenn and I, and I can see it only getting better from there.  Now, the artwork in this game is truly amazing, compared heavily to Dixit.  Would love to try this in higher player count games though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The Dixit-related stuff is my favorite part about Mysterium. The art is really interesting, and it's fun to try and determine why you were given a certain clue by the ghost; was it because of the color, or an object, or a general theme of the picture?

Or maybe the ghost just didn't have very many choices, which is perhaps a drawback of the game, but I would need to play more to know for sure. It's also a somewhat quiet game, it seems, since apparently the ghost isn't supposed to provide feedback or have any discussions. Thematically, perhaps there could have been some sort of communication method back and forth, like the ghost bumping a wall or moving an object or something. I don't know.

It was fine, and I would play it again, since it can be fun in various groups. But I am not currently interested in buying it.

I tend to not like co-op games (maybe a bit of an understatement), but I greatly enjoy this game. This lacks a lot of the things I dislike about co-op games. I love the exercise of trying to see things the way that someone else sees them. I find it fascinating to try and interpret how someone else interprets a picture. I think this game is significantly easier with two players, but I was also surprised how well it worked. Also, play with the original Polish rules.  They are better.

RATING: 8.5
I'm not a huge fan of clue and while I really liked Dixit I found it very hard to believe that a game that basically combines the two would work, let alone be enjoyable. I'm glad to say that I couldn't have been more wrong.

I've played this game with gamers of all different levels of experience and it never fails to captivate all those who play. By the end of everyone's first game they all want to try to be the ghost no matter how difficult you say it can be. I laugh every time cause literally everyone who has played the ghost will say at least once, if not several times, how hard it truly is.

Love this game and will play anytime.

Fun party game. Wonderful artwork and production. Absolutely love the creative and interpretive game play. We never play with the clairvoyance tokens (the semi-cooperative element). Still on the fence about whether I like this better than the simplicity offered by dixit.

Really interesting game with a cool premise and mechanics. 

Pros: relatively easy to learn and explain, really engaging art, sturdy pieces, the way you work as a team is fun and listening to how a team interprets the images is entertaining. the game has an awesome theme and overall excellent play experience.

Cons: set up takes forever. FOREVER. so many cards and pieces needed to set up. getting the card's pair is absolutely tedious and keeping piles of cards everywhere is just a mess. i have no idea why weapon cards are so tiny... they either need to make each category a different size or all the cards the same size. the betting mechanic feels... "unnatural" in the sense that everyone has to be reminded each time to place their votes. there's significant amounts of downtime. especially with an overly thoughtful ghost. finally, winning at the end doesn't feel like much of an accomplishment. i guess winning isn't the same if no one loses.

The cards are beautiful, and this game is fine to play with kids and friends who aren't total board game geeks, but I myself don't enjoy it that much. Also: playing the ghost is really frustrating because it's very hard to find vision-cards that fit the right suspect/place/murder weapon. 

To me the storytelling of this game is lacking some logic - why would the ghost give out "visions" that point in the wrong direction?

The theme is sort of there, but never really made any sense to me. Why is the ghost giving different clues to different people when she want them to find the murderer? The voting mechanism was also out of place. But I do enjoy this over Dixit due to the theme.

It's very challenging, as it's hard to really be able to connect the pictures and the visions together, which makes it frustrating.

Still, the mechanic is novel and interesting, and I think it's been cleaned up in this edition.

Feels like a cooperative riff on Dixit.  In fact, you could use the cards from Dixit to expand Mysterium.  It reminds me of Codenames as well.  The trouble is, I like both of those games more.  Cooperative games just don't do much for me.  This one is no different.  It's well conceived, beautifully produced, and a game I wouldn't mind playing every once in a while, but significant downtime, limited depth, and the lack of a real winner ensure that I won't request it.

It turns out that I was right: this is NOT my kind of game. At all. I do not speak [i]dream[/i]! Most of the people I played with knew each other so I took their advice early on in trying to interpret the dreams I was being sent. Sadly, in the case of my dreams, they were always wrong. I was the last person to make it to the top -- and even then, it's possible we played an extra round just to get me there. 

So what do I hate about it?
- it's a co-op
- you spend a lot of time sitting around waiting to be given a card
- the cards are very vague ... the whole thing feels very random

The game was vaguely interesting in a ludologic sense -- how they used Dixit tools to craft a game -- but this game is NOT FOR ME.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I bought this based on the glowingly positive Shut Up & Sit Down review and the fact that they keep bring it up every now & then and continue to tout how fun it is. 

For me it's...mediocre. If you want a super-light [b]activity[/b] to do & don't care all that much about strategizing or competitiveness, this could be for you. If you're familiar with Dixit you pretty much know what to expect.

Ultimately, this wasn't for me. I pulled it out once for my regular gaming crew & doubt it would have ever seen the light of day again. I could have kept it until my kids grew old enough to play, but by then something better & more fun will likely exist.

For a game of this length & weight, I'd prefer to play Timeline Challenge. You can play Timeline in teams and everyone is doing the exact same thing. In Mysterium, the ghost [b]cannot[/b] talk to any other players until the game ends. Meh.

RATING: 8
As far as my opinion on the game, see my comments on the Polish version.  These comments are specifically relevant to the content of the American release where it differs from the Polish version.

First of all, hopefully you have played the Polish edition or know someone who has.  If not, download the English rules for that edition and ignore this rulebook entirely.  If I didn't already know how to play the game I would have a really hard time understanding how to play from this rulebook.  It's almost like they expect people to already know how to play because huge chunks of the rules are either omitted or summarized unclearly.  There were a couple times where I went back to the rulebook for a clarification on a small rule to find it nowhere in the rulebook.

On top of that, the rulebook is worth ignoring because the changes between the Polish and the American version are all poor in my opinion.  The major one, which has been addressed by others at length, is the dumb intuition mechanic.  This new mechanic has you voting on whether other players guesses are correct throughout the game and the amount you get right dictates how many of the final 3 cards you actually get to see at the end of the game.  It slows down the game, adds nothing to it, and is counter to a fully cooperative game.  But there are other, smaller, things too that I think are negative changes.  For example, when drawing a new hand in the Polish edition you needed to discard your entire hand.  In the American version you can discard and keep any number of cards.  This takes away from the game, making it a bit too easy, especially if you use this on the final clue set where you have to provide 3 clues from one hand.  Part of the fun and challenge is giving 3 good clues from such limited options and trying to interpret what you're given from those options.  Another is that in the American version the rules tell the ghost to pick the final culprit, that just seems like a silly change.  Picking randomly is much better because it prevents any sort of bias the ghost may have when picking (which if the psychics know the player playing the ghost, might be able to use to influence their decision for better or worse).

So that's a lot of negative stuff but I would still recommend this version over the Polish version every time.  Because the rules are easy to ignore when you can easily obtain the Polish ones but the components in this version are far and away better than the Polish version.  The ghost board especially provides a way to hold, organize, and easily and quickly view all the information.  The player pieces are these attractive plastic crystal balls instead of boring wooden pawns.  The cards are numbered for easy searching and organizing.  The clock that marks the hour (number of turns left) is also an attractive and thematic way to keep track of turns.  The art for all the cards appears to be the same from the Polish version.  If anything, they provide too many nice components as many of them go unused most games and just add to the amount of stuff on the table.  The player envelopes for example, or the crows to keep track of redraws.

So if you like or are interested in this game then this is the version for you.  I would not even venture a look in the rulebook though, just download the English rules for the Polish edition of this game.

An updated version of Clue. One player (the ghost), tries to give hints about the murder by giving the other players cards (similar to Dixit cards) as hints. Great family game.

When I played for the first time, ghost's will wasn't transmitted, and therefore a ghost was agonizing himself.
I played the role of a ghost at the 2nd time. My will was transmitted to my daughter immediately and wasn't transmitted to my wife.
The game which can play happily by everyone.

Outstanding mix of Dixit and Cluedo. The game is stunning from a visual standpoint, an example of how to produce (and not overproduce) a game to create a perfect atmosphere. A game that everyone will like. If I had a single quibble, it would be that the game is rather easy and making it harder is a bit fiddly, but it works.

RATING: 7.5
I didn't think I would enjoy this one, but it has a spooky atmosphere and the dream cards are the cause of so much creative debate.  The deduction here comes from guessing the ghost's clues for who murdered him/her.  No literal minded people need apply for this game because the abstract Dixit-like dream cards need to be heavily interpreted.  Recommended to play with a silent ghost who communicates correct/incorrect card guesses through knocks.  It's alot more atmospheric. . .

I looked forward to this one for SOOO long: the Dixit-y art work, the fun components, the cooperation, the entire premise, but our first and so far only play was flat and a little frustrating. I suspect (and strongly hope) that my rating on this one will change, although I think it's going to take a game with more than two players to make that happen, and I'm usually one to defend two-player variants. Controling two psychics just felt weird, and some of the mechanics didn't seem to make the best of an excellent theme. Perhaps it was just an off night...

Our family really likes this CLUE meets DIXIT murder solving game.  Nice use of imagination and "mind reading" to determine the murderer, location, and weapon.  Interesting gameplay in that the ghost is confused, so needs to have all players first match up suspects, location and weapon before then having all of them determine which of the groups is the right one.  Surprised that this plays as well with my 8 year old as with adults.

Mysterium takes forever to set-up and put away, but I still like to play. The ghost gives clues to each player about a possible suspect, location, and weapon. My group is terrible at this game.

Received via trade from Boardgameco on BGG.  Still NIS as described.  July 2017

Played with 4 players (1 Ghost, 3 psychics) on Easy Mode and the game was sort of lackluster for us.  We won via me selecting the correct options at the end and having the most clairvoyance points, but it was meh at best.  Am hoping to try it again with more people as psychics and/or up the difficulty level to see if I think the game improves.

Glad I got to play this before dropping any cash on it! Takes the neat and original concept of Dixit, slaps a flawed theme (that doesn't really fit properly!) and with it a load of extra rules and fiddliness and stretches it out into a co-op game that left me feeling 'meh'. In short..... I'd rather play Dixit

Beautiful game with a very creative deduction element. The suspense each time you make a guess based on your clues and the moment where it all clicks are really rewarding.

Yep, that's what it is. It's up to you to decide if you like that. I like Dixit a lot, but it kind of depends on the players. But I don't like co-op that much. It works nice, but I felt kind of lost. Maybe the fact that I was falling asleep during both the explanation and the game itself had something to do with that, so I'll play this again if I can.

This is a perfect 10 candidate, but I want to play it a bit more before I give it a 10.  This is an amazing and better version of Dixit with an interesting theme and more interesting mechanics.

I raised this to a 10 a while back, I recently played it again and I think that might be too high for the game, still an amazing game, but replay-ability starts to drop a bit, admittedly this can be improved with expansions.  I am leaving as a 10 for now but this is likely to drop back to 9.

Further update: I am dropping this back to a 9 it is still a great game but replayability is lacking if you play with the same people.  I feel like once you have played 3-4 times you no longer find being the ghost fun and it is only fun to continue playing as a guesser with a completely new player on the ghost role.

I own [thing=113997][/thing], so I was curious to see what they did with the English version.  The components are generally better, although the art on half of the cards is different, and I think I like the original art better.  I do like the voting mechanism in the new version.  Also, the end game is clearly improved with the new version.  I was looking to trade/sell my copy of [thing=113997][/thing] already, and now having played Mysterium I am definitely ready to move my copy.

It can be a little fiddly for what is essentially a partyish game, and the voting system is a bit meh and could be done away with, but the core mechanic combined with the detailed cards make for a different and intriguing game. The theme really works with the experience of the game, and almost feels like a newer, better Cluedo. Very thought provoking, but the co-op nature while fun, can also lead to some nasty arguments!

Mysterium definitely does a nice job streamlining and tweaking the rules of its predecessor, the Polish game Tajemnicze Domostwo. I'm not sure if I like all the changes in the art between the two editions, though. I like Mysterium a lot. The only downside is that the ghost really needs to be a decisive and experienced player or there can be far too much downtime.

The Asmodee edition of Mysterium adds structure and shiny bits to the original, but they add up to little more.  This is not a game that improves with more formality.  The airiness of the original is gone, and the new cards seem to be lifted directly from Dixit.  Some may prefer this artwork, but neither version will delight.

RATING: 9
This one is Dixit killer for me. Well not exactly killer - Dixit is a fun party game but it lacks a more meaningful gameplay for gamers. Mysterium on the other hand delivers and is really good in that. The setting is great, components are superb and we really enjoyed all games we played. IF you like deduction and co-operative games you should definitely try Mysterium.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So, they built a deduction game around the Dixit artwork which works reasonably well, but the game has its quirks. The final round is a bit of an anticlimax. In the pre-rounds, it seems a bit strange that you are kind of punished for rushing too fast to the solution (you have less time to score points which give you more hints in the final round).

We may lack the necessary fantasy, most hints we used were actually color hints (the ghost gave us an image with a lot of red to draw our attention to a card with red background etc.) Problem was that two players were colorblind so they could not read these hints. We still beat the game easily.

Like a combination of Codenames and Dixit.  

I much prefer Codenames, though, because there's less "this one, I guess..." to it.  Sometimes in Mysterium, the ghost needs to pass along dreams that essentially mean nothing, which takes away from the fun.

Very cool haunted house theme, though.

I didn't buy the game in Essen 2015, because I was not sure about it. Not in the sense of doubting the quality and innovation of Mysterium! I was wondering, if I could find enough interested friends.
Three weeks later I bought it and I was overwhelmed by the acceptance, joy and fun a lot of my friends had. We had to play three games in a row with nine people (two "tag teams"). Most of them are no geeks, some playing occasionally. I guess this is the main target group of the game. Surely friends of Dixit and families will enjoy it too - not sure about kids, because of the murder theme and atmosphere. "Vielspieler" had fun with it too, but more like a filler game.

The game difficulty can vary a lot depending on the cards the ghost draws! There are some nice variations of playing the game here on BGG.

Oh what a game. What a bad, bad game.

You get cards that may or may not have anything to do with the thing you're trying to figure out. If the ghost player has good cards, you can get good cards. In most cases, though, the cards are too abstract to allow for many clever connections and it all just seems random.

The game feels underdeveloped in a couple of areas. One is the voting. Players have vote tokens which they can use to vote on whether or not the other players are right or wrong about their guesses. When you get one correct, you move up on a score track. The score track, in turn, will let you see more secret cards at the end of the game if you're higher on the track. However, you only have to get to about level 7 on the score track to see all of the cards but the track goes all the way to 13. There seems to be some sort of disconnect there as there's no reason keep advanving on the track. There's also a big problem when you get to the final round. At that point the ghost gives three final clue cards which are meant to point to the crime. Again, if the ghost has just one good card then this part is easy. Otherwise, it will be as random as the rest of the game.

This game is even worse than Dixit. At least in Dixit the player gets to choose the clue so there is a chance that somebody will get it. This game removes that one strategic element and makes it come down to random luck of the cards.

As if the game isn't bad enough, then Deception: Murder in Hong Kong came out around the same time. Deception is great and uses a similar system, so there's really no reason to play Mysterium.

(Oct 2015) I quite like it, but it might end up being a "sometimes game" that I need to be in the mood for. Still, it supports up to seven, and that's rare in itself. I think it's probably best with 4-5 though.

I am generally not a fan of co-operative game. But this one does a great job of removing the problems I usually have with them. For one, it's light and is intended as a party game primarily. So there's less at stake in the beginning. Secondly, it removes the alpha problem, because everyone's opinion matters since everything is so subjective. It's fun, but like nearly all party games, I tire of it quickly.

Really like this game.  Wanted to love it and was sure I would, but the "final guess" mechanic is a little wonky and counterintuitive.  There needs to be some specific way the ghost chooses the final person/place/thing.  Instead it just seems to be whichever pile the ghost could most effectively suggest with her drawn cards.  Just a little strange end to an otherwise incredibly fun game.

RATING: 6
I really wanted to like this game, since I asked it as a Christmas gift and it looked awesome, but the hype and excitement lowered a lot after a few plays. 

Its first problem is the randomness; the murderer is just a random pick at the end between three suspects, so it is not known from the beginning, which messes with the possible "story" about the ghost who wants to tell you who murdered him or her. The combinations of weapon/place/person are also random, which I understand (it is like Cluedo) but they don't offer anything for the story either.

The second problem I found was that it felt to me like a limited Dixit, because the vision/dream cards are just like Dixit ones, but in Dixit there are countless possibilities to interpret them whereas in Mysterium you have to link them to some detail in the suspect cards... and yes there are many, but at the end, for example, if you want to point towards the cook, you will use food elements (if you don't have you will have to be a little more creative, but this is situational), etc.

I still give it a 6 because it is very pretty, I like the Dixit mechanic of making guesses based on artistic cards, and because after some time of not playing it I found some enjoyement on playing it again as a light and fast game... especially as the ghost ! I like to hear other people making guesses about what I picked.

I had been looking forward to playing this game for a while, and it's honestly one of my favorites right now. It's a gorgeous game with a theme I adore to no end. Ghosts are great, and the nebulous nature of the ghost in this one really shines through. I would like more card packs to be released over time, for sure.

RATING: 7.5
Neat idea and it really is carried off well in this. I highly recommend if you often play in larger family (you know, Ranging from 8-90 years old) settings.

After the game we always have a great time discussing the circumstances surrounding the unfortunate circumstances.

It does not replace Dixit or any other family games because the setup and rules are far and away the most complex of any other family game I play. It is nice that the game can be tweaked to change difficulty.

I love when a publisher really does their best to make the game presentation as fabulous as is reasonable. It only helps in getting a game to the table.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

This is a wonderful game. Bought it after reading multiple reviews and becoming intrigued when reading the backside of the box. One player plays a ghost and gives dreams to the other players who have guess what the ghost is trying to tell them. It's a cooperative game and interaction is high. Game mechanics are better when playing with 4 players. The box is very nice and sturdy and everything is well placed. The art is very beautiful. It's a keeper and stole our harts. Oh, my daughter is 10yrs old and didn't have any problems learning the game. Having a child amongst the players will be an advantage because they look at the dreams differently and will certainly be very helpful in making the right choices.

Better than I anticipated it being.  I picked it up for my wife, who I knew would love the game, but I can't say I was confident.

But it has been a refreshing game to throw in on occasion even with a more "hard-core" group of gamers.

Not to mention even my mother-in-law thoroughly enjoyed this one.

Play with the timer!!!!!!!  The one thing that can really ruin the experience is letting the game drag on.

Mysterium was a very fun deduction game to play. However, it isn't a game without some flaws. The end of the game is just weird as you get certain amount of information. So we didn't play with that and the game was better. We played also on a combo of hard and medium (or easy), so there were three ravens, but with five players, we had 9 total rooms, people, and items. But it's a very fun game and I really like the way that it played without the goofy voting system.

First Impression:
A very unique highly thematic friendly cooperative game.

I really played this with the wrong group, as the owner was more interested in making points about how easily you can game this or that version of the rules instead of actually playing. Simply put, if you don't like cooperative games you won't like this either, as it's not thematic in the sense of an adventure game (aka descent f.e.), instead it's a very simple game about communicating through images.

I need to try this more, it seems to have potential.

This is the English version of the game. Previously I had played the Polish version which is very very similar. Most of the changes in the game are aesthetic. While all the clue cards are the same. The weapon cards, location cards, people cards, and all the card backs are completely redone. With the possible exception of the people cards, all the art seems much better to me.

There's also a lot more stuff with the game. A nifty screen with pouches for the ghost to put cards in... the front of which is absolutely gorgeous. A clock standee thing that counts down the rounds. Ravens that perch on the screen. Cardboard markers that designate the different areas to place the cards. Colored player placards that you give to the ghost, so he can assign cards to players more easily. Crystal ball player pieces. From an artistic/production quality standpoint, this is definitely the version of the game to get.

There are also some rule changes that alter the game slightly. The order in which you solve the crimes is changed, which is a slight difference. There's also a voting mechanic where you can put checks or crosses on other player's guesses to indicate whether you agree or disagree with their choices, although you have a limited supply of those tokens.

If you're right, then you'll get to see more cards at the end of the game when the final murder dream clues are sent. In the final part of the game, one of the sets of people/place/weapon are going to be chosen by the ghost as the actual murder and players will see up to three cards (depending on how well they've judged their partner's guesses) and then vote for which one is right. The combination that gets the most votes is who the team selects. This is the biggest different between the versions. Guessing whether other people are right or not is fun, but I'm not sure I love how it impacts the final part of the game. But there's nothing stopping you from playing the Polish rules.

About [thing=181304][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=181304][/thing] is [thing=1294][/thing] meets [thing=39856][/thing]. Players are mediums that receive dreams from a Ghost (the clue giver), in order to solve a murder in the house in which it occured. The dreams are cards - in [thing=39856][/thing] style (ie: weird and beautiful, with lots of possible interpretations) - that the Ghost send to them. Every player has a set previously made of Suspect/Place/Weapon, that they must discover in the time given. If everyone manages to discover their set, a final round will happen, in which the Mediums will have to uncover which set is the true one.

This is basically it. [thing=181304][/thing] has simple rules and is very easy to learn. Playing time do fits around the purposed 42 minutes, even when having a full table (7 players), but it gets shorter with less, as even with some of the game being simultaneous, when the Ghost give clues, the less she has to give, faster it is.

The game allows for cooperation, as players can help others in trying to "crack the code" of the messages and understand the meaning of them.

Overall, [thing=181304][/thing] provides a fun enviroment (with room for light banter - "what do you mean with this??"), with some tension (not much, but there is a timer, which always put pressure in decisions) and team work, all in a gorgeous package, with a short playing time.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
After the set up, the Ghost player make random sets, among the cards used, and pair them with each player - this is the first goal of the Mediums players, but they don't have this information, of course.

All the medium players have Right/Wrong tokens, which they can use in the guesses of other players, accordingly to what they think - when they are correct, they advance on the track.

Players receive clue cards in order to guess first the Suspect, then the Place and finally the Weapon. If the player can't guess right on the first chance, they keep the card or cards received, and will receive more in the next round.

After every player received their clues, the time to guess starts. Players must use their Right/Wrong tokens also inside this time. Once the time runs out, the Ghost player announces who was right and who was wrong. The ones that got it right, advance to uncover the next piece of of information - the Place. The ones that didn't, stay to find the Suspect. 

The clock advances 1 hour and a new round begins. Now the Ghost will give clues accordingly to the spot players are (so, she will give clues regarding Suspect for those still to find theirs, and Places, for those already there). This will continue until one or more players discover the three things they needed. These players will advance on the track 7 minus the Current Hour in spaces (so, the sooner, the better). After this, these players will still be able to help the others behind to uncover their sets, but will no longer receive clues themselves.

Finally, if everyone uncover all the needed informations, the final round will begin. The Ghost will select three cards, one to represent the Murderer, one for the Place and one for the Weapon - all of these three things will belong to just one of the sets the players uncovered. However, not everyone might be able to look at all the three selected cards before taking a guess about which is the correct set - this is decided by the place on the track the player is. The further, the best - that is why reaching the end soon and/or using well the Right/Wrong tokens count. Once everyone has chosen their guess about the correct set, the guesses are revealed and the set with the most votes will be the one selected. If the set is indeed the proper one, players win! If not, they lose.

Players also lose if the time runs out (7 rounds) and there are still someone who haven't discovered all the needed informations.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
For the Ghost there are more decisions: which card or cards to send to each person. This is indeed the hardest part of the game. Not truly "hard", but sure can be tough.

For the Mediums, it is just a matter to see the clues and take informed guesses - both to find their own things, and also to use their Right/Wrong tokens. While understanding the clues can be a tough nut to crack, the decisions on themselves are rather easy and can even be left for chance.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Beautiful production - both for the components and the art;
- Easy to play;
- Quick playing time;
- While others can help you with the clues, the decision is personal, so there is little room for alpha players;
- Language independant.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Not everyone will want to play in the Ghost espectral shoes, so the position can be left several times with the same person, which can be a bummer;
- Due to the open nature of the clues and guesses, the game can frustrate players that like more control and objectivity;
- The added pressure of the hourglass doesn't fit well with everyone;
- There can be some downtime while waiting for the Ghost to give out clues.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like playing Wraith: the Oblivion, without all the drama and with added colors. When playing Wraith we, sometimes, had to pass information to persons alive. Maybe an Espectre threatened them, or someone was robbing them, or even something as simply as reminding your wife to read a bed time story to your kid. The work of a bounded wraith is hard, though, so we had to use the little we had with a lot of cost in pathos. And almost all the time it went wrong.

Normal people simply aren't ready to deal with messages from beyond the shroud. But there are the Mediums - like Oda Mae Brown, from Ghost. They not only could hear better, they also, usually, don't freak out completely when a wraith spoke or wrote to them. Still, that doesn't mean they would understand our meaning - just that most wouldn't faint, die or eat pills to end the whispers. Again, the job of a vengeful ghost is hard. It seemed so simple to us!

Well, [thing=181304][/thing] makes the job of the Ghost a constant roller coaster of emotions, usually going from elation, of having a clue hit home, to utter frustration, of many losing their mark, even when they are as clear as possible, because one picture of a jungle full of dangers has a tiny image of a boat, so of course you meant the Sailor and not the Explorer. It makes sense! Now imagine that you, as a Ghost, truly wanted to do precisely this, because that was the only freaking card with a ship or even a sea on it!

Therefore, the guessing work for the Mediums isn't truly a piece of cake all the time. Sometimes you are 100% sure of something, only to discover that, well, 100% sure is one of the most assured ways to be wrong. This happens because the Ghost [i]must[/i] send clues, even when she doesn't want to, because no card has a good connection to what she wants you to see, and, worst, they can send you off the track. It is usual that Mediums who made one of two wrong guesses to have conflicting clues in front of them, which can be exasperating. And in this is the fun of the game - otherwise it would be too easy and direct to be worth the trouble.

In the end, [thing=181304][/thing] fulfilled what I expected of it: a quick and fun game, with little to worry about and with some banter and laughs spread across the play. I recommend it.

I have rated the original a 7 but the new versions is far less fun than it. It does have a wonderful screen for the ghost but that is the only better thing. The added game clutters the game and makes it fiddly. It's not fun that you are playing a coop where silent hidden majority in the last round determines whether you have won. Why add a betting mechanism to it? It's unthematic and completely unnecessary. And it shades the fun thing in the game: deciphering the dream cards.

A mysterious mix of Dixit (from the same publisher) and Cluedo. It's even possible to mix up your dixit cards with the vision cards of this game to add even more variance.
The fact that the ghost player can not talk for the entire game (he or she may only point and knock on the table), adds to the athmosphere, but might be challenging to some of the players ;-)
Includes a link to download a 1-hour soundtrack to make it an even more creepy mysterious experience.
Despite the fact that a ghost is involved, I think it's still perfectly playable by the younger players without scaring the hell of them. Just leave the soundscape asside in that case, and they will soon drown in the game without caring too much to get nightmares.

This game is a lot of fun with a talkative group.  The timer adds a lot of pressure and tension early on but usually doesn't even get close to running out later in the game.  Being the Ghost is tough and rewarding. Definitely more fun with 4+ players, but is fine with less.

A cool spin on Dixit, giving it some more layers. Instead of creating clues out of thin air for the cards in the ghost's hand, the clue is a predefined picture card and you have to figure out what could be a good match. (Opposite from the psychics' perspective.) Different audiences for the two games. I'm guessing over time, Mysterium will feel more natural than it did after the first play.

I don't like cooperative games but this one is different, it plays a lot faster than they usually do.
For every player, there is a crime “scenario“ fixed and you try to find out your murderer, scene and weapon, each time with the help of the ghost player (which knows everything). This is a very fun and unique aspect of the game.
It has some parallels to Deception but is way better because you really get close to being sure whether you're right or wrong (not the case in Deception).
The big pity is that you only win together which is just boring.
But all in all a good game, recommend it.

Having never played Dixit, all friends who have say this is what Dixit should've been.

The beautiful cards and components really deliver the spooky seance theme, which I absolutely adore.  I don't really see myself saying no to playing the game in the near or distant future. It's fairly quick, and I usually find the time for a couple games before everything is packed away again.

It’s fun.  Easy to learn, quick to play, and beautiful artwork on quality satin cards. 
Only played with 4 and would recommend for at least 3, but likely just as good all the way to 7.  Also cool to play on the iPad App in Story Mode - gets more into the theme.

The production, theme and artwork are all stellar in this game.  I think it's a really unique experience that is really enthralling to non-gamers.  As a gamer, it's pretty fun, but leaves me wanting more.  There's a lot of idle time waiting for clues, a lot of luck of the draw, and seems like every time I play you can run through all of the rounds no problem but then it comes tot he final round and you just don't see what the ghost is intending and all fail regardless.

It's a fine game, I'm happy to play it if someone else wants to, but it doesn't do a whole lot for  me.

One player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. The ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, with each medium needing to deduce which suspect, location, or weapon corresponds to the vision cards received.

A bit luke-warm on this. Really liked the concept, and hoped it would allow us to play Dixit with only two players. Instead I feel it mostly works with a large set of players, and in this case I find it quite stressful to be the ghost. Also, the game has so many fiddly bits to provide a bit of theme, which, while nice - ultimately makes me prefer the simplicity of Dixit.

RATING: 7
All that potential for mass market... And either rules or mechanics convoluted so badly even our gaming group had problems understanding how to play. I have understood that the original version is faer more streamlined than this reproduced version. Maybe using old rules might make the game work.
Beautiful art, better than Dixit but that would be the main reason for me to buy, use the dream cards to play Dixit.

A light little frolic of using oblique cards to communicate with other players.  It's nice to see somebody using the style of card art that is present in [gameid=39856] and doing something new with it.  The actual game of communication is a bit too slow for my taste.  The atmospherics from the art and the pieces are great, and with gamers who are inclined to roleplay a bit, the immersion can be even better.  The theme doesn't make much sense at all, despite the atmosphere, but it's pretty enough that most players won't care.

Love this game. Like its predecessor, Dixit, I get to see how my friends brains work and I fricking love that aspect of these games. We all tried the role of the dearly departed and everyone was surprised to see how hard it was to convey the right information using specific cards.

After playing a three player game I want to see how much more involved a 7 player round would be. More options to go wrong or misconstrue seems like it would be more fun. Also looking forward to the possibilities of expansions!

My observation that I don't really enjoy Dixit/AtA/CAH style games remains true. I generally enjoy trying to interpret what other other people are thinking but I seem to always either overthink or underthink it. 

The game around Mysterium is interesting, but it was VERY confusing for me to decipher my goals every time. Was I guessing the murderer? Am I guessing the victim? Murder weapon? Why does everyone have their own guess that's different? I think that, theme-wise, this confused me and made the game harder than it needed to be. 

I'd play again, and I might like being the ghost even more than a player, but it's certainly not a game I'd request.

I hear a lot that this game is basically the offspring of Clue and Dixit. Dixit hasn't yet appealed to me enough to try so I was quite surprised when I came across this game just how much it peaked my interest. In fact I really enjoy playing this game that it is one of my favorites. Even better, it is only about 45 minutes to play which makes it great for when you want to play something not too long. The only downside to this game is that you need to play with a fun group otherwise this really entertaining game just turns into an enjoyable one. Which honestly is a pretty good downside to have if any.

Excellent re-playability because the cards change everytime. The artwork is gorgeous - reminds me a lot of Dixit. It's less frustrating than Dixit because you have more cards to handle and you're thinking of making connections, not signifiers. 
We didn't use a timer but I think that would have added an element of pressure that would've kept me more engaged. We talked it out a lot and played it very co-operatively which was cool. I like co-operative games like Pandemic so this was right up my alley.
I could see that the amount of fun you have probably depends on the players. I really enjoyed it - it's a good mental challenge, requiring a lot of analysis and thought and creativity but without strategy. A+.

A good deduction game where one player has to hand hints to the other players in the form of cards with abstract paintings on them.

Mysterium borrows the central mechanic of Dixit: Communicating via surrealist art cards.  However, it gives it a narrative structure that makes the game much more compelling: You're a ghost sending visions about your murder to mediums, who have to work together to work out the details of your death.  Highly thematic, highly atmospheric, and a lot of fun.

Mysterium is such a neat abstract game to play. First time I saw it being played I was immediately drawn in by the gameplay and the theme of it.

You have your group playing a ghost who hands out picture cards as clues for the ghost detectives guess which card is associated with the dream card they received to advance through 3 stages/levels to find out who the killer is.

It's so much fun, playing as the ghost it's so much fun trying to figure out which dream to give to the right player, and hearing what their thought process is in deciding what message you're trying to convey to hint them to a card.
As a ghost detective it feels so satisfying when you figure what the ghost is trying to tell you and also hilarious facepalm when your intuition is wrong.

I do recommend at least checking out the game.

If there's any negatives is I would say replayability is not as replayable as I might have thought it'd be with the number of cards(But I might just need to play on the more difficult settings to see a difference), but there are expansions that give more cards to use so that might help.

Nice game that does really well within my gaming group. Really easy to teach to people who are already familiar to Dixit, yet easy enough to teach to anyone. I like both being the Ghost and the investigator.

I don't really like the ending part of the game, where the Ghost decides upon a murder that all investigators have to guess based on a number of cards they are allowed to see. I do like the voting part the comes to the table, so I can see some value. I just don't like the finale to be honest... Is the most boring part for me as investigator (it's okey as Ghost)

The art in this game is absolutely incredible.  The vision cards really are a thing of beauty.  Unfortunately, they're so abstract that it's really difficult to make any sort of connection between the vision cards and the people/location/item cards.

An amazing experience. Although the long replay-ability might wain over time as people become accustomed to the cards (my only complaint). This looks gorgeous on the table, oozes cooperative play, is stuffed with gobs of theme and is still fairly simple to play. I love being the Ghost more than the psychic detectives, but I'll do either side. Perfect gateway game, this is what Clue wishes it could be. Basically its a cooperative twist on one versus many. Its One who is "dead" which means I have all the answers and must give you abstract art cards as clues versus the rest of my team who must figure out said clues and deduce who killed me, with what, and where. Everyone should own this game.

Mysterium is constantly teetering on the edge for me on whether I like it or not. The Clue x Dixit love child idea is a clever one, although in practice has a couple of flaws. 

First is the downtime. One player has to study an array of cards and can take his sweet time, and this gets worse with more players. If you're not the ghost, you're just waiting most of the time. 

Secondly, you have to see the cards well. You have to study all of them meticulously, and with bad lighting or with 6 others crammed around a table, this can be quite a challenge.

The description of Cluedo plus Dixit is really true, but the gameplay is much better as in Cluedo. All the players are trying to figure out their mystery at the same time and can even help each other, the vision-track and the reveal at the end add a nice bit of competition and the player screen makes playing as the ghost feel really cool.
I would definitely recommend this over Cluedo if you are looking for a murder-mystery game.

Mildly intriguing and thematic gameplay and coupled with good artwork and substantial player interaction. However, it may not be suitable with a group of strangers, and is more suited for friends, as clues will need some familiarity with the player taking on the ghost role. Indeed, the enjoyment of the game is heavily dependent on the ghost role, e.g. how good the clues are and amount of downtime.

The game has nice artwork and good quality components. However, some of it seems over-produced, e.g. the crow markers and very tall game screen.

A present from my BGG Secret Santa 2016.

We had a lot of fun playing this. I took it with me to a camp and it was a real hit with most of my friends.

Fantastic mix between Clue and Dixit. It has a good replayability. It`s more like a partygame.

We greatly enjoy this game. It's Dixit meets Clue.

Dixit with a purpose is an overused but accurate description of this game.  I like studying the neat artwork looking for links between images and found the group deduction to be quite enjoyable.  I was less keen on the scoring system, but it seemed to work okay.  We also played with the easiest setup so perhaps I'd like it even more with more restrictions in play.  Not something I need to add to my collection... but if I wanted a new deduction game this would probably be it.

Set this game up for two players, and discovered that this wouldn't be any fun with just two players. Would need at least a group of four to make this game interesting.
Not one to add to our collection someday.

Probably over hyped, but the art is beautiful and the game was fun. Good for a large player count. The voting stuff is kinda "meh." EDIT: I've come around on the voting, doesn't change my ranking.

I am not convinced with the game yet, I played as the ghost but it was really difficult to do sounded choices. It seemed too random and people at the end was doing random choices. There was a lot of table talking and jokes, what I loved. It seems to depend pretty much on the people, for example, one girl was guessing every clue, was amazing, she was really a psychist!, others couldn't associate anything.

Works great with 7 players. Never won but we came close once!

Plays best with 5 or 6. We tried 7-player mode twice last night and couldn't get all the psychics to guess their set of suspects. 

With 5 or 6, it's a great co-op and an excellent gateway game.

Dixit meets Clue.  The game is great to play unless the ghost/game master is too cerebral or over thinks things.  Otherwise it's great

A nice game, people who're into the 'Dixit' genre will have a great time playing this game as it extends it on various levels of gameplay.

As the owner of this game (another one from our wedding registry!), it's fallen upon me to play as the ghost in every game except one.

I'm not great at Dixit, and so here, I'm not sure how well I do at guiding the mystics with these surreal visions. The mystics always seem to have a good time, so there's that, at least!

Takes the madness that is dixit and builds a fantastic cooperative game on top.  Can occasionally be very stressful and the points for voting system is sometimes a little counter-intuitive (at certain player counts, everyone guessing correctly all the time is actually bad for the final round).
Even so, I've never had a game of this which the players didn't enjoy.

Érdekes és nagyon hangulatos volt. Megfelelő társasággal van benne erő, de otthonra nem kéne, két fővel nekem ez esélytelen. Egy beszélgetős-borozgatós-félhomályos házibulin azért szívesen játszanám többször.

Nagyon jó partijáték, ha rendszeresen össze tudtuk ülni minimum 3-an, akkor kötelező vétel, nagyon megéri az árát!

Csak sikerült rábeszélni magam. Baráti és családi összejövetelek egész ősszel-télen (szülinapok, karácsony, szilveszter), megéri még ezen ritka alkalmakra is az árát.

Lecseréltem a pimpelt változatra. A paraván miatt kap még fél pontot, sokkal szebb így az élet.

The main problem with this game is that the "ghost" (the player who gives others the clews) usualy spends about 10 minutes to decide which hints to give to other players ... in the mean time all other players just sit there waiting... chatting and basicly not playing the game. When they finaly get the clew.. they chose their pick in like 1 min and then they wait for another 10 minues of pure boredom... That makes this game super boring for everyone except for the ghost that is in action all the time, cause he is rushing to give clues.

Amazing game with simple yet very involving game play. 
The first game left me wanting for more. 

Lovered rating after playing as one of the guessing characters. Lot less fun than being a ghost. Still a solid game.

Eine Mischung aus Dixit und Cluedo, die mir besser gefällt als Dixit und Cluedo. Ein Spieler gibt als Geist Hinweise in Form abstrakter Bildkarten, anhand derer die restlichen Mitspieler Täter, Tatort und Mordwaffe erraten müssen. Sehr schön gestaltetes Spielmaterial. Ideal zu viert, geht aber auch mit mehr oder weniger Personen.

1st play: Enjoyed my play of this, not a top ten game as newer stuff has come out. The player elimination is what holds the game back, as getting eliminated early makes you a watcher, and needing a moderator means every round someone has to run the game. Might be fun on a camping trip or something. 

Good for it's time, but too difficult to get to the table and includes player elimination. No go for a large party game.

We had a blast playing this game.
I can see how this game could be terrible, but the group we played with were comfortable goofing around with each other that the stories were fun, and the excuses were great as we tried to find the sneaky wolfs.
We played three times after the first because it was so much fun.

Pros
- Plays up to an insane number of people
- Sense of being scared once you've survived for so long 
- So many different roles and ways to mix and match them. Easy to customize
- With a good moderator, a good tale can be weaved 
- Best when played at 9-19 players. If you want to play more, get more roles that have a lot of killing and less roles that protect people
- If playing with mostly new people, always balance towards the Villagers and work down from there

Cons
- Player elimination. It's not so bad as long as you keep the numbers down 
- A moderator is needed. He/She needs to be good and aware of the roles and keep the game on track. It can be fun, but someone has to be the moderator.

Went over to my friend's place and finally got to table [thing=152242][/thing]. This was the first game I Kickstarted! The art work is just so much more appealing to me compared to [thing=25821][/thing].

We played started with the Tanner, and the Werewolf. Then over the course of the games, I added the Bodyguard, the Hunter and the Mayor. Everyone had so much fun that we ended up playing this for 9 times. Looking forward to playing this more often. Going to start on the other Werewolf series too!

I realized I fulfilled the daily challenge too, to play an unplayed game from my collection. In fact, this is what I am trying to do. Get more plays and also play all the unplayed games in my collection. Great challenge.

This game is hilarious and thrilling with the right group of people. Ideally, you want a group of like 14-16 people. Big enough that there's variety, but small enough that you can still pay attention to most of them. It's still fun with more or less people, but with more it can be a little overwhelming at times.

RATING: N/A
A game I really wanted to play and try out with people but we never had a good amount of people to play; let alone enough time that would accommodate a 10+ player count.  My wife and game group love "One Night Werewolf" and all the other renditions out there so having "Ultimate Werewolf" made sense.  Unfortunately, we just couldn't bring it out to play so to clear up some room on the shelf, I traded this away.

RATING: 7
Es un juego de engaño muy divertido y lo mejor de todo es que pueden jugar muchas personas juntas, lo que lo hace excelente para reuniones familiares. Es sencillo de jugar porque no es tan difícil engañar a los otros jugadores siendo uno del equipo de los malos. Lo único malo que tiene es que es de eliminación, así que tiende ser muy aburrido para los primeros que mueren en la partida.

I learned about Werewolf probably in 2013 watching the Dice Tower videos. Around Christmas 2014, I ordered a fan made version of Werewolf off Artscow not realizing I can get a HQ version for the same price, but it sat unplayed for awhile. No one in my circle had ever played it. Then in Feb 2015, I went to a convention and signed up to play One Night Werewolf in the morning and regular Ultimate at night and loved it. I then went home unsure how well my game group would like it. I shared my artscow deck and it was a huge hit! I then introduced it to my extended family at our monthly get togethers and again a huge hit. Werewolf has caught on like wild fire in my circle. 2 friends have bought copies, Its crazy. It is my 10th favorite game. So I went and ordered this version.

I'm glad I played this because so many other social deduction games are based on it. My first game suffered at the beginning when most of us were new and nobody felt like they had information to act on, so everyone was just sitting around silently. But it picked up and got more dramatic near the end when we accused the the final werewolves and they couldn't lie their way out of it!

8-75 players, one of the oldest and best party games ever devised.

The problem is that this game contains player elimination, so in larger games some people will be knocked out in the first 5 minutes and then be forced to sit and watch for the next hour.

Strongly recommended, but only where other entertainment is available!

Finally got to play this late at night at the Congress of Gamers and had a great time. Next year I'm definitely sticking around for this and/or [thing=134352][/thing]. The player elimination really is a bummer, though, but at least the game is fun to watch, so you have that to take comfort in. Still, the prospect is being eliminated from the very start, without really participating, is kinda depressing.

Positives: Game Narrator creating a funny story & setting (candyland) causing many candy puns.
The image of beating a person down with candy canes.
I liked the deduction for the Village Idiot, Tanner, Pacifist.
Latoya's GAME OVER comment to Emily as Em was trying to kill her but failed.

Negatives: 16 player game was way too slow for me.  
Perhaps 2.5 hour game.  
Lack of information to deduct many meaningful decisions.  
People getting killed early just sit around for 2 hours!
4 wolves vs 12 villagers game, 1 wolf left early, 1 wolf I killed as a Seer, 1 wolf I killed as she just seemed too quiet, but it was still a random guess.
1 wolf killed by Emily, but still seemed like we just got lucky
-I think I had a problem with too many special roles causing the game to go so slowly.  it was 80% narrating, 20% deduction.

? Might be better with less players to go faster, 
? Recommend playing with identities revealed after death. Then the story reveals as it goes, vs. can only be pieced together after the game is complete. 

but I think I would rather player Resistance: Avalon because the logical deduction aspect is stronger, and the Lady of the Lake is interesting, and the Merlin/Assassin gameplay.

only reason to play is for 11 or more players, but then the Player Elimination is a bummer.

* Kickstarted! *

Beautifully rendered version of the Werewolf game that comes with enough range of cards to play between 7 and 30 players. The Kickstarter version also comes with alternate art. However, the base party game is the same as before.

PLUS: artwork, full range of roles, optional art packages, up to 30 players!
MINUS: requires a minimum of 7 players, game becomes boring pretty quickly (a once/twice type of party game with little laughs)

To me, this game is absolute perfection. Games with a horror slant to them are my favorite so from the spooky theme, to the fun of setting a creepy and thematic mood for the group (I can't stress enough how far a few candles and some great mood music go with this one), I love everything about it.

Yes it's a party game, but it's a party game with a hint of tabletop sophistication.  It's getting a bit harder these days to gather together 15-20 people to play, but when we do it's always a treat; everyone has a blast - and it's a great way to not only introduce people to gaming, but introduce people to other people in general.  Some people don't enjoy the idea of being eliminated, but frankly, that's what makes this game so enjoyably stressful. You WANT to stay in, and when you have a group of people who understand that fighting for your place in the village is how you play, watching the remaining players struggle with the swings after you've been eliminated (or as the moderator) is still hugely entertaining.

We've played this for hours on end and never seem to get tired of it.  There's always great discussion afterward (sometimes for days) and it's really fantastic for camaraderie and bringing friends together - even though you're probably trying to kill every single one of them...

Werewolf is a social deduction game that is best played in a larger groups. 20 people is probably a good maximum. In my case it means that game is not played that much, but I do enjoy it when it happens. The game also needs a moderator which means that a good moderator pretty much makes the game. A bad one can ruin in pretty badly.

The games are usually fast enough so I don't care if the moderator messes it up. Then you change the moderator of course!

RATING: 7
How many board games do you own that can play up to 100 folks!? That feature makes it worth $20 alone. Pro tips:

1.) The moderator should NOT be given out randomly and SHOULD be given to your most flamboyant, expressive, and creative player/s. 
2.) Interact with the players. "What's the name of our village, Ben?" "Lydia, what seedy activities do you partake in after dark?" "Hey gang, what pagan god do these cultists worship?"
3.) Mod should walk around during midnight conversation. Prevents players from hearing which way he's looking. 
4.) Recommend playing with 1/3 specials, 1/3 vanilla villagers, and 1/3 werewolfs. Might slightly skew ballance to Wolves victory, but more folks having a special ability (Bodyguard, Cult Leader, Tanner, etc.) means more folks invested in the story. 
5.) Recommend playing with identities revealed after death. Then the story reveals as it goes, vs. can only be pieced together after the game is complete.

RATING: 10
Name of the game is very descriptive. It's the ultimate version of Werewolf, with Deluxe components. Yes, as with Telestrations you can again question if it makes sense to buy something you can make yourself, and again the answer is yes. If you don't own any Werewolf version yet then it's no-brainer. This is the best one on market. If you own one of the cheap ones ('87 or '01 edition for example) then I'd seriously consider upgrading. Not that this one is ridiculously expensive either, it's well worth the money and huge improvement. If you are very big fan then it's even worth upgrading the previous Ultimate Werewolf, as this one has role effects printed on cards. There's tons of cards to run even multiple games at once, awesome moderator guide & scorepad to make moderation easier, lots of rules variants I hadn't seen before and great artwork to enhance the mood, make it more "professional" (not in a boring way). There's also amazing app that's really helpful for moderator, if you happen to own a device to run it. Perfect social game for 11-25. (Less than that and I'd say Resistance is better)

Werewolf is fine, but I hate player elimination and find that when the village wakes up, the game almost always devolves into instant chaos, with very little reasoning behind why someone is voting for someone else.  Besides those issues, I just have so many other games I'd rather play.  With higher player counts, 2 Rooms and a Boom is my favorite.  With lower, One Night Ultimate Werewolf is my favorite.

I'll keep this game in my classroom for if we ever have any extra time, but it doesn't have a space anymore in my main game collection.

Hidden role game similar to Mafia. Accusations and debates galore as the group tries to oust the werewolf (or werewolves). Game can supposedly play up to 75 people, but I would not want more than 12 in a game due to how long it would take and the downtime for those that get eliminated early. The variable player powers for the villagers is a nice touch. The game does require a game moderator, however. A classic party game that can be fun but needs the right group, both in size, as well as composition.

Great game only problem is you need at least 10 people to play it and it be worth it.

Hands down, no question, the BEST version of Werewolf you are going to see for a long time!

I mean, what else is there to say? It's Werewolf, and that's about it. The absurd amount of variety in the box is nice, and it's still a fun experience if you have a big group that can't bear to break up for a couple rounds.  But it's still Werewolf. In that sense it's pointless to review it.

It's Mafia, but with a werewolf theme. Really requires a good moderator to make the game enjoyable.

Kickstarter Edition. Is it possible to improve on what is already the greatest social game around? It seems it is.

This edition has more roles, better card layout and awesome artwork. If you're a Werewolf fan you just have to get this game.

Thanks Corr!

I've been moderating werewolves lately for groups of like 30-40 people.

Great implementation of the classic party game Werewolf.
I prefer One Night Ultimate Werewolf to this and I find Ultimate Werewolf Inquisition even better. However, only this game works with larger groups, and is a blast with the right set of people.

A great hidden identity game, with lots of roles and catering for 70+ players.

It needs a moderator though (I find this fun, but not everyone may)...also, players get eliminated, so there's a lot of people out of the game early.  May not be a problem, as they can just start something else...but they may be a bit miffed at the experience.

The newest version of Werewolf. Not really any different than previous editions, although the artwork might be a little better this time. That's largely a matter of taste, so I don't see a reason to re-invest if you already have some form of Werewolf or Mafia in your collection.

The deduction and lying are very fun, and the amount of non-gamers you can pull into this simple game is a beautiful thing. The base cards start to get boring after awhile, but there are tons of new and interesting roles in this edition. At the same time adding a ton of special roles can really drag the pace of the game down a bit. Also relies on having a quick, and good moderator who doesn't mess up. In the right circumstances it's amazing, but the right circumstances can sometimes be elusive so it doesn't get played as much as it used to and stays at a 7 rather than an 8 or 9.

Werewolf (or Mafia) is the game that really got my big into the hobby and BGG in 2013. It had me searching on BGG for other hidden role games such as The Resistance, Bang! The Dice Game and Coup. Had I not been introduced to Mafia I don't know if I would have half the collection I have today.

RATING: 7
A fun party game, that I can go either way on. Great with a crowd, especially when drinking, because there's one person dictating everything. Not as fun in smaller numbers because one person has to sit out.

I gave a 7, because I only play this game with large groups, and it's always fun with a large group, but getting 10+ people to play a board game isn't the best.

RATING: 5
You pretty much just accuse someone of being the werewolf, and then fight about it.  It's more fun than it sounds.  I've played only with 11 people thus far, and I can't imagine the chaos that would happen with more.  Requires a moderator, which automatically makes One Night Ultimate Werewolf a better option unless you need the massive player count of Ultimate.

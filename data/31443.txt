The ultimate extension of the grand tactical Napoleon's last battles system. Gorgeous to look at, a blast to play. The battles are frightful affairs, bloody and razor-edged for who will win. You can play as pure battles or sort of campaign-battle hybrids, shwoing events leading up to battle.

Looking forward to this one! Purchased Dec 07. NAB series with cards to add spice. A simpler overview of the 1807 Campaign in Poland as compared to 1807: The Eagles turn Eastwards by Zucker.

Has a set of solitaire rules for the series designed by Mark Herman.

The system has slowly gotten more and more encumbered with too much
(IMO) detail. The clean design of Napoleon at Bay was subverted already
in the 80's. This design adds (although apparently NOT a part of the standard
2X rules - thus rewriting much of the core rules into the exclusive booklet) the
concept of administrative action CARDS (instead of the points previously used)
with CDG-like events attached to them; that decision significantly increases the
amount of mental effort to assess the play of each command, without material
benefit. Worse, those cards drive some key elements, such as siege, so if you wish
to go to the standard 2X rules, you end up having to fudge your own rules to handle
these considerations.

The 2X design choice is also not to my liking. I prefer the greater scope of the
larger maps (and smaller units), but I can certainly see the benefits that this
choice would serve for many players.

And...of course, this being a Zucker design, the rules are a mess.
Another clear case of failure to blind test.

Enjoyed this alongside Petre's 'Campaigns in Poland'. Great little system with wonderfully evocative graphics and some neat cardplay. Systems are a little complex but soon bed down. Of course, playing solo without fog-of-war and scouting vedettes means that you only get part of the experience, but a great introduction to the system and great fun to play

Un jeu tout d'abord superbe, surtout si on utilise des supports de pions pour faciliter la lecture des forces en présence. La carte est somptueuse. Le jeu repose principalement sur les trois scénarios de campagne jouables en 5 heures en moyenne. les situations sont variées et tendues et l'apport des cartes simplifie énormément le système le rendant plus attrayant. Seul bémol, les situations sont connues car ce sont les mêmes que pour "The Eagles turn east"...

Didn't even know about OSG before the deal with GMT. I've been looking for a solid Napoleonic system that doesn't skimp on detail and is largely in print (or committed to print). OSG seems to have it in bucket loads: the maps, counters and different systems are first class. I like the look of the operational ones best and I've pre-ordered Highway to the Kremlin as well.

I've read the rules and I can see how this will play; I'm also interested to use the card play.

OSG Kevin Zucker on the battle of Eylau and Friedland.  The operational system is the standard for any Napoleonic treatment.  I don't think of any other system which could surpass this.  Ooopss...OSG is going to be out of business.  This could be another collector item hot for a chase. Got it from the local game store at a hefty price (USD92)for 280 counters and 1 map. Sigh.  Anyway, it is the last game that OSG issued.

The Habit of Victory and the "2X" campaign system upon which it is based is solidly operational rather than tactical Napoleonic warfare.  The best feature of the game is the clever implementation of what amounts to hidden movement, without having to write out moves.  Each force shows up on map as just a flag.  Off map are displays that contain the actual troops.  Attach a "flag" and you might find a small vedette of cavalry (a great concept for obscuring what you're up to!) or the leader of some real force.  The vedettes can also be used to force leaders to flip, so you can at least see who is there and judge what type of force they're apt to be leading.  They could die in the process though, but that's the price of information in the Napoleonic era.  This system would be absolutely fantastic for face-to-face play, giving you a real feel for the Napoleonic operational information vacuum.  Alas, I played this game solo, so all that uncertainty was lost.  Still, played solo The Habit of Victory was at least as good as the somewhat similar Great Campaigns of the American Civil War.  In short, it's a pretty good game even with its best feature disabled by solo play.  My rating would probably be at least a point higher if I'd been able to play someone face-to-face.  The tension would have been incredible as the campaign scenarios would become a real game of cat-and-mouse across Poland and Prussia.

There are cards - representing both logistics and events.  The later make the game somewhat card driven, but not oppressively so.  They did not seem to be an impediment to solo play.

Leaders, they're the heart of the system.  Each leader is rated for initiative, how much of effort it is to get them to listen to their superiors (i.e. are they prima donnas or god listeners) and how many units they can command.  A great leader doesn't take much attention from his commander, but can think on his feet and has a good command span.  A poor leader takes more command attention than it would to just lead his troops directly.  This slickly simple system captures most of the idiocy that was 19th century command and control.  It would be just as appropriate in the American Civil War.

I also appreciated the emphasis on non-combat losses.  This was particularly appropriate for this winter campaign.  From what I've read in the histories, this feature should be included in American Civil War campaign games too.  In Zucker's 2X series games it really pays to sit still if you don't absolutely have to move, particularly in bad weather or with a large force.

Another benefit of the off-map display of troops is that you don't end up with stacks that want to fall over.  Given that the paper map warps badly in humidity and won't lie flat no matter how firmly you tape it down this is an important feature.

The numbering of the rules paragraphs is unusual, but works fine.  Linking the paragraph numbers to the sequence of play was a huge help since the sequence of play is fairly complex.  The rules are generally clear, with information every place you might think to look for it.  A few items though appear in just one spot and with just enough detail that you can figure them out on the 10th reading.

The materials were varied in quality.  Some of the player aid cards were nice cardboard, others frayed along the folds and yet others were poor photocopies on plain paper.  The matte paper map cracked along the fold immediately.  Sigh.  Everything went back together fine with enough tape, but still.  The pieces were nice though and solidly made.

First approach to the game, the cards provide a flow to the system that was very much needed. Will keep playing and exploring this one in the near future, and I sincerely expect to rate it higher.

(Update) We didn't keep playing this one beyond the 1st two games.

I bought this, mint copy, at my club's anual gaming auction. Having read the rules I can understand why it was mint. And next year, there will be another mint copy of this game at my club's anual auction.

The rules are dreadful. The person seling the game was honest and said the rules were a bit of a mess, but I managed to give them a quick skim before buying. It was only when I got home and tried to digest them I realised what a mess they were.

No wonder there are so few comments about this game, very few people have actually managed to play it

After one half play of battle scenario 1:

Learning the game was an incredibly frustrating experience. The rulebook and charts would lead you to believe that this is a very complicated game, but it really isn't; it's actually relatively straightforward. What is really needed to bring this fact to the fore is a new, combined rulebook, properly laid out and formatted.

However, beyond the problems with the rulebook, Habit of Victory seems to be a very intriguing and compelling game with some very clever mechanics. I particularly like the option to fight pursuit battles rather than pitched battles, the fog of war element, and the attrition rules.

Now we've figured out most of the rules, I think we'll have a go at the campaign game.

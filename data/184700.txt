RATING: N/A
In a world of Euros with tacked-on themes, this game stands apart.  It's all about the fame and raids, really giving you a feeling that you're in a race with other players.  I found there were lots of opportunities for Viking jokes or even Iron Island jokes.   There are some minor downsides:  the huge advantage in going first (which can be fixed by letting everyone else have one more (non-raid) turn until you return to the starting player); need for a player aid (that can be downloaded here) to avoid calculation mistakes;  direct player interaction (which is common among Euros)  -- but all those are easily gotten around or just part of the game.   Overall, this is a fast-paced Euro card game.

Ok game but nothing overwhelming. VERY let down by quality, or lack thereof, of the mini's (soft plastic, weapons bent, vikings all look drunk as almost none are standing straight). Art is VERY good IMHO. But ultimately, with Champions of Midgard in existence, little reason to play this one.

I won this in a giveaway from NSKN Games. It has a similar theme and feeling to Champions of Midgard, but with more of a Euro feel and less randomness. The art is beautiful. The miniatures are okay, but really aren't required. Colored, wooden cubes would have actually been preferred. The game plays pretty fast and the choices are very streamlined. Really needs some player aids. A lot of re-playability due to so many unique cards and you won't use them all in any game. Though I am glad there is not any randomness for raid via dice rolling like in Champions, there needs to be some additional "unknown" or chance of failure to me. Not sure what. I just know the raids are missing something. The part where your opponents plays cards to add to the raid requirements just isn't cutting it.

Demo'd Essen 2016 (by the designer): Generally a very nicely produced game (shame the plastic minis are too big for the grid, are pretty ugly and have a grey faction to support black actions ?!!). Aside from that this is a well structured and balanced game about Viking raiders. Apparently inspired by Fire & Axe but with no dice.

RATING: 9
Kickstarted - glad I did (it's always a risk buying 'blind').

Quick euro that I like (and I don't like many euros). Turns are usually short and you can plan a bit while waiting which helps.

Only niggles I have are perceived player order advantage (going 4th or 5th in a 5 player seems harsh, you're likely to get 1 turn less than everyone else), end game trigger seems a bit wonky - as the last few raids are likely to grant few VP and you have to turn in vikings (worth vp) to take it, why do it? We've seen a couple of games where no one wanted to raid which just felt wrong ... (now fixed, see update :)

Production wise, great art, but again a couple of niggles:

1. minis - weapons very flimsy so I have warriors with bent hammers and swords, even after the hot/cold water trick. Also they don't really fit on the board space - meeples probably would have been a better choice.

2. player boards - not colour coded, so people have to remember which colour everyone is, not such a problem with a regular group where people tend to be a particular colour, more an issue in the club setting.

*** Update, definitely one my wife and daughter like so it's a keeper for now :) Our fix for the turn order is to play until 2 raids remain, at that point the game end is triggered and the round will play out and one further one - and the raids are refilled to 5 (from those removed from the game). People seem happy with this solution.

I was surprised by how simple the game play here is. Cards and card play are simple, clear and intuitive (except for maybe the acquiring of a construction token which seemed to trip ppl up a bit) Its very quick and easy to pick up and play well. 

The race to complete the raids is a tad weird and players don't really develop their village (well we didn't in our 1 play so far) so I felt the theme wasn't the greatest connection to the gameplay, however from a pure hand management perspective I did thoroughly enjoy this one.

The rules for the heroes are a tad ambigious and a clarification would be nice ......do you have to spend (discard after use) the hero when you raid? if they have a raid action do you have to take it?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Firstly lets get the negatives out of the way:

You can end up in a bizzare position where the game enters some form of purgatory, where no one wants to take the last raid as it would actually loose them victory points; this will almost certainly be the case if a 3 VP raid ends up on the final sea space.

There are also a few issues with how useful some of the other aspects are, such as buildings not being considered after the first few turns due to a cost that increases exponentially.  Furthermore no one ever seems to buy anything but a 2 cost hero as chances are you just want to have one so that you can raid.  Really I would have thought that they should start at a cost of 3, like all of the other resources.

The race nature of the game, trying to grab as many raids as quickly as possible, leads to raiding for VPs being the dominant strtegy as they are finite and offer the best reward for the resources required.  This seems to be at the detriment of other strategies and also reduces the game to a mad scramble which is at odds to he euro inspired mechanics on offer.

So is the ending a bit wonky, does the first player have an unfair advantage and is the game a bit to reliant on raids for victory points at the detriment of everything else?  Probably, but then it plays in less than an hour, looks amazing and some simple houserules can mitigate some of the balance issues I have with the game.

**The house rules that I tend to use are as follows:**

During setup, take all of the 5, 6, and 7 VP quests and randomly shuffle them, dealing one facedown onto the raid space.  Shuffle the rest of the cards back in to the deck and deal out the remainded as appropriate for the player count.  This stops the last quest from getting stuck if it is a 3 VP one in the 3 distance space.

Building discounts cannot be used during raids.  This makes more thematical sense (did you take your Inn on the boat with you? ) and make the raids a bit harder.

The game does not end when the last raid is taken, instead it triggers the end game and the round is finshed thereby ensuring that everyone gets the same number of turns.

Overall I like this game a lot, and I love just looking at the board, pouring over my options and wishing it had had just a bit more playtesting and time in development.

There are some cool things to this game. I liked the duel purpose cards. The quality and artwork were great. The gameplay was simple to learn and understand. However, at the end of the day...things felt a little scripted. The excursions felt a little tacked on, having to match other players symbols. I would put this as the same weight as basic ticket to ride. Which, isnt always a bad thing. But you have to know this is a very light game coming into it. We liked that it was short 30-45 minutes. At that length, its easy to hit the table. I dunno...It just feels lacking to me. Not horrible, but not great. Id maybe pick this up on a trade or on sale.

Nice game of hand management. You use card symbols either to buy stuff or to get vikings in three different colors, which you send on raids (i.e. spend) to gain victory points. Nothing really stands out, but the simple mechanics work. The theme is very superficial, even for a Euro. Scores tend to be very close, and it seems to be one of those games that any average player can win. But my main complaint is that it ends abruptly when the last raid card is taken, with an unmitigated turn-order advantage. There is some good artwork, but the board layout, with a lot of wasted space, could have been better.

Part of the kickstarter for this game, and it's a really smooth game. Basically your cards have icons and you use those colored icons in groups to buy buildings, viking ships and vikings of different colors to complete quests (think lords of waterdeep). Fun game. The only thing I would suggest, leave the vikings in the bag. The game suggests putting the plastic models on the table and it's just to much clutter. Played it 2 player and while it wasn't world changing it was fun enough to bring the table again.

RATING: 5.5
A perfectly cromulent hand management card game.  It is *just* a card game, with a board giving you places for the various decks.  The Kickstarter version was overproduced with miniatures that get in the way compared to cubes which were clearly the original intention.

In the end, the game is forgettable.  I sold it after 2 plays.  It would make a decent gateway game, and it might get bonus points if you love the theme.  However, it's fairly abstract and is mostly tactical rather than strategic.  Despite one mechanic where you can play cards to affect other people's raids, the game is verging on multiplayer solitaire and is a race game for raids, which leads to a feeling that the other parts of the game should have more impact, specifically building your village.

In truth, I think the game lacked play-testing and the rush for raids puts the other elements of the game out of balance.  Yes, there are issues, but they aren't devastating.

If you're playing this, you might look for variants, specifically in regards to the end-game.  I felt like this needed the most attention, and I'm not usually a house-rule kind of gamer.

A light and fun hand management game. Fun and interesting powers in the buildings you build, but the fact that they only come in some variety didn't feel nice and the pace at which you get them is a bit off.

More unique powers and a bit more variety would benefit the game. I would pick up an expansion and keep playing if it can provide that.

Wikinger waren im Jahr 2016/2017 ja das Thema f√ºr Brettspiele. Im gro√üen Fokus stand nat√ºrlich das Strategieschwergewicht Ein Fest f√ºr Odin von Uwe Rosenberg. Auf der Messe Essen 2016 fiel mein Blick schon auf das Spiel In the Name of Odin von NSKN Games. Die deutsche Version landete dann sofort in meiner Spielesammlung und wurde ausf√ºhrlich auf Herz und Nieren getestet. Das Ergebnis ist ein kleines bisschen Ern√ºchterung. Die Spieler wollen mit ihren Wikindern auf Feldz√ºge gehen. Daf√ºr ben√∂tigt man ein Schiff, einen Helden (Anr√ºhrer) und gen√ºgend gewaltbereite Wikinger. Das Spiel wird gesteuert √ºber Karten, mit unterschiedlichen Symbolen. Je mehr gleiche Symbole man auf der Hand hat und abwirft, desto st√§rker ist die gew√§hlte Aktion. Man bekommt bessere Helden, bessere Schiffe, mehr Wikinger usw. Au√üerdem kann man in seinem kleinen Dorf noch ein paar Geb√§ude bauen, die das Pl√ºndern und Brandschatzen erleichtert. Hat man alle Voraussetzungen erf√ºllt, geht es auf den Raubzug. Ruhm, Ehre und vor allem Siegpunkte wollen schlie√ülich gefunden werden. Hier versuchen die Gegenspieler den eigenen Raubzug zu erschweren. Doof nur, dass sie daf√ºr ebenfalls die sehr wertvollen Handkarten abwerfen m√ºssen (macht dann fast Niemand!). Auch doof: Nach einem Raubzug sind Held und Wikinger quasi weg....√ºber Bord gefallen, totgesoffen oder am Zielort verblieben. Aus der Sicht der Mechanik macht es Sinn, aber logisch ist dies nicht. Das Bauen von Geb√§uden ist ein spa√üiger Aspekt des Spiels, wird aber nach jedem Geb√§ude immer teurer und schwieriger zu erreichen. Nicht falsch verstehen: Im Namen Odins ist ein wirklich sch√∂ne Spiel, mit einigen guten Mechaniken, einfachem Einstieg und angenehmer Spieldauer. Aber es ist kein Vielspieler Spiel, denn daf√ºr gibt es dann doch zu wenig Abwechslung. Zum Schluss noch ein Wort zum Spielmaterial. Die Illustrationen sind fantastisch, das Spielbrett riesig (fast schon zu gro√ü) und es gibt kleine Miniaturen-Wikinger....und genau die sind das Problem. Die Figuren sind teilweise so verbogen, dass sie nicht gerade auf ihren F√º√üen stehen k√∂nnen. Entweder sind sie so weit nach vorn gebeugt, als w√ºrden sie gerade den letzten Rausch bek√§mpfen, oder sie fallen einfach um. So etwas ist echt √§rgerlich!

In the Name of Odin is a pretty basic resource gathering, contract fulfillment game. You collect Viking figures of different colors, ship with some extra symbols to count as more Vikings, and a hero with special text to lead the expedition, and then choose a raid with Viking requirements to fulfill. Opponents also play cards to increase the requirements (and add a random factor), but these extra requirements can be met with cards from hand, and if they're not met, you still complete the raid with a minor penalty. There are also special-power buildings that can be built to help you. On the whole, this game felt very vanilla--there are lots of other games that do this sort of thing better.

Pretty much a basic resource gathering game.  Use sets of cards to collect three different types of warriors, hero to give a special ability, boat, and buildings that give a special ability as well. All of which help you go on a raid - think contract. your opponents can add cards to make it a bit more expensive and you can counter from your hand.
Not bad but not very exiting either.

A Euro game, with each player having a hand of cards that can be used for multiple purposes.  To be honest, the viking miniatures didn't add anything to the gameplay, and would have been better served either as hard plastic tokens, or cubes, given that the molded plastic figures are frail. The game felt like a race to complete raids, as that was the principal way to obtain glory, and working on building one's village was secondary and had less glory awarded.  Nevertheless, it seems that the small amount of glory from having a few buildings can make the difference in end game scoring, and adds some variety to gameplay.  It did feel like the limited number of raids available in a two-player game put pressure on to complete as many as fast as possible, so perhaps even having two or three more raids available would relieve that pressure and allow for more building.

tl;dr: good, but nothing new

The theme of this game has something to do with vikings. And there's a board with a map. And there are plastic figures. But this certainly is not a dudes on a map game. It's not even a fighting game. No, the plastic figures could just as well have been wooden meeples (I would have preferred that actually) and the board is just a place to hold cards and has lots of dead space.
So this game is overproduced, but it is just a resource gathering game with a building element. The main source of points is doing raids. Raids is paying resources for points. You can be more efficient by having the right boat, buildings and or leader. So managing all that is what the game is all about.
There's nothing new here. It works fine, but it doesn't stand out for me. None of the elements is done better than any other generic resource euro.
So it's worth playing, but you don't HAVE to play this.

Card driven Viking game. Some familiar mechanics with some fresh twists. Players draw cards and replenish hands from a shared deck. Each round, play sets of cards from your hand that allow you to recruit a hero with special abilities Concordia style, prepare and build structures and boats, and collect colored Vikings to of course raid random village cards by matching the color combinations a la LoWD. I like the swap action from a shared pool of action cards to mitigate a bad draw.

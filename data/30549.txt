Is great when you beat it for the first time in the highest difficulty, everybody stand up, cheers and hugs, somebody may drop a small tear. But when you do it for the 3rd, 4th, 5th time..... it isn't that fun any more. Is great to introduce new players though.

Rating after watching 1 game and playing 2.
Fantastic!  Easy to learn, compelling, fun, co-operative without 1 player dominating, great balance, excellent ability to make the game more difficult, edge of the seat tension, "we'd have won if only.....", quick to play, "lets play again"-ness, cheap, cheering on the viruses!  What more could you want in a boardgame?

I'm not a big fan of co-operative games. This is one of the best (and has a very clever card recycling mechanism which keeps the pressure on the players) but it's still a co-operative game

I really dig into the theme, but the QB issue has finally sucked some of my enjoyment out of the game. The second problem I have with it is that the setup and mechanics of the game, while complimenting the theme, ultimately are more tedious to the game than what I'd prefer. That said, I'll totally play this over Forbidden Desert (again, technically sound, but less interesting) or Forbidden Island. Like many coops, the problem space is limited once a solution is found. Pandemic sort of, but not entirely, avoids this with the multitude of variants at your disposal in the expansions (and I think both On The Brink and, less so, In The Lab are sort of required for that reason). Oddly enough, the Legacy game does avoid this as the basic premise changes in subtle ways so you don't see the entire problem space each game.

Really great game. I've already convinced my Mum to pick up a copy and take it back to NZ.

It's been really tough for us on 3p with 1 win to 8 losses. We now realized we were playing the rule incorrectly for treating cured diseases.

Will always play if given a chance.

I need to play this more to properly evaluate it, but so far it looks like the best co-op game ever made, and second place isn't even close.  Great theme, good components, tough game system, smooth gameplay, and looks like some interesting expansions in the pipeline.  I should add that I'm not really into co-op games, so maybe giving it only a 7.5 doesn't do it justice.

Own the [boardgame=40849]On the Brink[/boardgame], [boardgame=137136]In the Lab[/boardgame], and [boardgame=168703]State of Emergency[/boardgame] expansions.

RATING: 8
Pros:
Unique and interesting theme. The tension cranks up as the game goes on. Streamlined rules and smooth game mechanics. New gamer/family friendly. Games are always close. If you find it too easy you can crank up the difficulty level. Good component quality (I like the transparent plastic cubes). 

Cons:
Might get repetitive. Alpha gamer issue (not a problem for me as I'm the Alpha gamer!).

N.B.
Mum always saves Sydney, Australia even if it only has one cube on it. Not sure the game needs expansions as it plays fine on its own.

Bought it on a whim and have really enjoyed it.  A quick, fun coop game that is challenging and has a great theme. 

Downgraded after 5 or 6 plays.  It really loses its luster--it is way too obvious what each role is supposed to do, and I have had no desire to play this one since.

151119 Late in 2014 we started playing it again and what an excellent game.  We also dug up the bioterrorist variant and its quite fun, even 2P.

130929 Some how the fear of an alpha player has gotten me scared to pull out this game.  But its still a great design. But I rate games by desire to replay and Pandemic just hasn't been getting the itch for me to play.

100212 A little Easy in 2player, but wow...a lot harder and a lot more fun with 4.  Played it with 5 and it was damn near impossible (finally won with only 3 epidemics...and even so with 3 cards left the deck).

[i]tl;dr - It's Pandemic. I have problems with the alpha-player tendency (which the game does nothing to curb) and the repetitiveness, but it's a favorite co-op for a reason.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Alisha loves this one, so I finally caved and bought it. What do you want me to say about it, it's Pandemic? I won't play 2-player with her, though. 

I am finding Pandemic Legacy to be a whole lot more interesting, because your decisions carry over from game to game, and it communicates the tension of the theme more effectively. Base Pandemic is just absolutely boring. I think that the base game needs a random deck of 'objective' cards (similar to how you face different objectives in Pandemic Legacy) to spruce it up and keep it fresh. 

Beyond that, something that I dislike in all of Matt Leacock's games is the alpha player tendency. I know I can be this kind of player myself, and I hate that the game doesn't do anything to smack me down and keep the collaboration even among players. While it is intensely satisfying to dream up a last-ditch effort to save the world and win the game, it's frustrating that the game doesn't force you to come up with that plan together.

A co-op game that is fun and relatively easy to learn and plays in a short amount of time. Each game tends to be very different and they are usually tense to the end. It's fun to give each disease a name and then watch it spread or try to cure it. The city spots are way too small for all the stuff that can go on them, though; a single pawn is larger than a city space!

Always different, Pandemic provides a challenging experience every time. It works with any number of players (one to four, albeit with a different feel with each option), and it is a decent solitaire option.

The "On The Brink" expansion adds a fifth player and several new roles and game play options. Still a fantastic hit!

RATING: 6
Lots of theme here, love it. The game is overall enjoyable, the epidemic cards really added a lot of tension to the game. However, once it was done I couldn't help but feel unsatisfied... "that's it?". It is difficult however when teaching new people to not basically play the game for them (do this, do that). It seems as long as one person has a strong understanding of the game they can simply instruct the other players and come out winning, which doesn't say much for the "cooperative" aspect of the game... I would play it again, but I traded it away as it didn't see much play from my shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Played twice. So far I don't quite see why some of my friends hold this game in such high regard. But since it is a friendly and relaxing coop experience I'm glad I have it in my collection. Rules are easy to teach. What worries me so far is the apparent lack of depth. I didn't get a sense of having interesting choices when playing. What to do and when seemed rather obvious. But that might very well change after some more plays.

Edit: Some more plays has confirmed my earlier worries. Both my wife and I consider the game rather pointless. There is little strategy, and thus victory or failure is mostly a matter of luck, not tactics or skill.

Pandemic is perhaps one of the best cooperative games. Perhaps it is like a great solitaire game where one must respond to a card-deck-generated set of circumstances - in this case - globally-networked viruses. Special abilities and base-to-base travel make the struggle great. I still must die several deaths trying superginormouslylegendary level.

SOLD! Definitely a clever concept (which intensifies over time much like a virus outbreak would) though it turned out less fun than I had anticipated. It kind of felt like an exercise in logistics - I have also briefly played with the expansion which does add some more flavour though overall the game is  light fun. The cubes should have been given hideous disease names such as Ebola, Avian Bird Flu, accelerated H.I.V. and Bubonic Encephalitis (is that real?).

I am not a big fan of co-ops, but this is a relatively good game. Most of the time, you can feel the tension and the feeling of helplessness, which is a thematic plus.

Revising rating to 10, because it's a rare game that's amazingly fun regardless of whether it's the first board game you've ever played or the 101st. The only requirement is that you play with people who can communicate. It is also possibly the most deep & interesting game of its length.

The rules state that you loose a game when one of the four diseases spreads to the point you cannot add more cubes of the particular disease to the board. During a play we nicknamed one of them 'dickhead syndrome'. And yes, we lost the game to this disease because we couldn't stop it. How ironic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Core Game Rating 6/10: An aethetically well presented game highly suited to solitaire play owing to a small board size and the absence of hidden moves. Designed for cooperative play, it is easy for a player to "cooperate" solo whilst playing a number of roles.

The core game however, is overly dependant on luck, to the point that the number of starting colors (diseases) on the board, the draw frequency of epidemics and the draw of 4-5 color disease card suits will determine victory more than any player strategy.

The game offers multiple ways to lose with only one way to win. The degree to which gamer's agree put up with this form of negative reinforcement will determine their overall attitude to the title.

DYO Game Rating 8/10: That said, given the ability to design one's own scenarios, the rating for this game rises substantially. Having designed the scenario "A Swine of a Flu" simulating the 2009 spread of the H1N1 "Swine Flu" virus, I found a game I now liked in offering multiple ways to win.

“Clear!” (Bu-Bump!) That’s the sound of Pandemic paddles bringing the stale, crusty heart of board gaming apathy back to life. If you, like many people, are under the impression that board games can be categorized into Monopoly, Scrabble and Clue… than let me suggest a double dose of Pandemic. It has a board, cards and pawns, but it plays nothing like its predecessors. This is a game about saving humanity from the ever growing threat of infection and life threatening outbreaks. The mechanics provide a constant drip of impending doom as players race cooperatively around the world to save humanity from extinction. This is a great game for couples and for introducing people to the hobby. The cooperative play is a unique element to new gamers, and the theme of saving the planet from disease is something most people can get behind.  A player’s turn will see them traveling to all parts of the world, beating back outbreaks and establishing research stations to cure diseases before they reach a Pandemic state. In addition, your team will activate crucial events like air lifts, government grants and sanitation that add an often needed shot of moral as you battle outbreaks in the most remote parts of the world. Like many other games, prescribing individualized roles for each player is what truly what gives this game a heart.

Exceedingly well designed and presented game. Perfect components, wonderfully simple in mechanics. Love the way the game unfolds as you play - and quite different each time too given the variety of start configurations. Fast, friendly with a well integrated theme - just a great game! Not sure on endurance over many plays, but so far, it's holding up well.

The only strike against it is the very real temptation (and even request!) for one person to control all the moves. This is especially noticeable during first plays for some while another is highly experienced.

It's alright and I think it doesn't disappoint. I like to play it with my flatmates because we don't have the leader problem that so many times appears with cooperative games.

That's why I think it's a good option for families and parents who want to introduce their children to the gaming world. You can work out the puzzle on your own, but if you really want to play with people it's easy to ask for ideas and try to develop a strategy together.

Further degradation of the rating due to fact that this game heavily suffers from the typical co-op syndrome. This is the one dominating player bossing round in the table telling people what they MUST do on their turn.

One of the best coop games around.  It is somewhat luck based, but rewards good play.  If you don't make good decisions, you will be punished with a quick loss.  On occasion the game will throw you an unwinnable scenario, but these are rare.  It has great strategic depth and requires excellent cooperation between players.  It can, however, be susceptible to a bossy player taking over, but this can be mitigated by playing with hands hidden from the other players.

(+) Theme and mechanics fit really well together, unique player abilities, variable difficulty, promotes teamwork, fun and realistic theme

(-) Some roles seem quite weaker than others, alpha players can control the game (needs the right group), can feel same-y after a while, Pandemic: On the Brink is a better version of this

Reminds me of 12 Monkeys, great movie.  However this game has the feeling of 'meh, I could play that, but I'd rather play something else'  It is more of a puzzle solver, this game SHOULD be tense.

The gold standard of coop games pandemic is as close to a flagship game as comes to mind for zman. It has spawned a gazillion expansions and new games under its brand. Ultimately, this is a great game about a team of specialists trying to stop a series of diseases from wiping out humanity. They usually lose. I recommend this game for people that prefer collaborative problem solving over competitive play. Avoid playing with alpha gamers who need to micromanage/quarter back unless you are a bottom sort of fellow.

Original 1st or 2nd edition cover (with masked / gowned doc).  Wife likes this more than some other co-op games and it plays fairly fast, so it hits the table pretty regularly.  Card draw mechanism (from top and bottom) is a great way to introduce new map areas without randomizing things too much--very cool.

RATING: 6.5
Great introductory game.  Perfect for non-gamers and wonderful co-op.  Criticisms?  The base set is too easy after a while and the expansions are definitely needed.  Also, for gamers, there are better co-ops out there (e.g. Defenders of the Realm) and in my experience it just doesn't hit the table much with players who have bigger game collections.  There's also the usual problem of having one dictater who knows the game really well, or playing with people who just can't communicate and do a co-op.  General criticisms though that shouldn't detract from one of the best co-op games out there.

If I were a virus, I would make sure to show basically no symptoms in the first weeks. This way, nobody would notice  I'm even there, and all your logistics experts would sleep happily in their beds and dream of their ugly girlfriends, not giving a damn about planning new CDC research centers. 

If I were a virus, I would show an evolutionary preference for certain climatic conditions (officially, I don't even qualify as life form, so don't you dare call me a racist). This way, your quarantine specialist wouldn't even know where to start when I suddenly pop up at all the end-of-the-world-places that take him so much time to travel to. 

If I were a virus, I would mutate a lot. This way, your scientist lady at the WHO would need so many more samples of me before having the slightest clue how I even look like. 

If I were I virus, I'd get you all.

Pandemic teaches as lot about viruses. How lucky I am not a virus.

This game is well-rounded in terms of difficulty. You will lose as often as you win. If you play on harder difficulties, you will lose often. Be warned, though, your group must work well together and you should wait to play until all previous grudges dissipate! If you don't work together every second of this game, the fragile thread that is holding victory together will break in an instant!

I ADORE this game. To me, this game is the king of anxiety-inducing, tense, edge-of-your-seat experiences. The co-op nature truly builds comraderie, and each person feels useful and helpful in averting Armageddon.

The art is excellent, and the bits are all well-constructed and designed. The pace of the game is amazingly fine-tuned, and you'll always feel one step away from defeat. This is a GOOD thing, as the game is intended to simulate a world-ending outbreak of diseases. If you didn't feel constantly under pressure, the theme wouldn't shine.

I highly recommend getting the On The Brink expansion. The vanilla game is awesome, but once you add in the fifth disease, new event/epidemic cards, and the option to have a player be a Bio-Terrorist and play AGAINST the rest of the group, Pandemic really takes off.

This game is a go-to game for my family, and I think anyone who is intrigued by the premise will love it.

Disclaimer: I played Forbidden Island prior to playing Pandemic.

Didn't like the new edition artwork. The board seemed too dark and it was hard to see at the glance what was going on. This game has more chrome compared to the Forbidden Island, but the additions don't make it a better game. Too long for what it is. I guess I will stick with its simpler version and sinking islands.

An excellent coop game to bring out with "non-gamers" and seasoned gamers alike.  The only downside I really have is the relative anticlimactic feel of curing a disease, but this problem is solved (somewhat) with the In the Lab expansion.  Always willing to bring out with the regular game night crowd or for just a two player game with the wife.

Had played this once years ago at my cousin's house, but recently acquired a copy, so we played a 3 player game yesterday. We did well, and thought we would win, but ran out of cards to draw with the winning move only 1 turn away! A big bummer, but then we realized that we hadn't played the medic's ability correctly after we found cures, so we still chalked it up as a win. Was fun, and a nice break from the common mess with each other games that we usually play. And I definitely want to try out On the Brink soon, looks like it adds a whole new level.

This is a fun game because of the co-op angle and you never get so good that you can automatically win (unlike a video game).  I also like that it is an exceptional solitaire game.  However, the level of fun does decrease with time.  With the first few plays, the game seems to be a solid 10, but with time, they settle into the 6-7 range, but I think that is typical with most Euros.

+ Unique theme sets it apart; Adjustable difficulty levels based on your group's ability level.
- It is usually fairly obvious what your best move is; The "boss" of the group tends to dominate and take over.


Why it's previously-owned:
This game got me into "real" board games.  We just simply played it until it got too mathy or too obvious what the best move in a given case would be. 
I traded this away for The Downfall of Pompeii.

It's a pretty sick game.
Also a lot of fun, even when you get destroyed in the second round.  Not a game to take super serious, as the luck-based nature of card draws has a bigger influence on the game than actual strategy most of the time.

I'm not that interested in playing it much anymore, since I like other games, but it is still a good gateway game towards prioritization and risk evaluation, and will probably always stay in my collection.

Simple co-op game, the variety in gameplay comes in the roles the group draws but since every turn is a co-operative discussion, that variety doesn't really get a chance to shine..

Pandemic is a co-op game that is not that hard to teach to non-gamers. This is the kind of game you want to play again and again until you beat it together. If you finally do that it feels really rewarding. But it is not an easy game. There are different levels of the game, but even the easy mode is hard enough the first couple of games.  

The game is both thematic and engaging. Every one of your actions can be crucial for the entire group. So you have to be careful and think through what to do. I've heard some complaints that this makes the game suffer from the alphaplayer problem, which is that one experienced or leader-oriented player are making all the decisions. I have not found this to be much of a problem in my different gaming groups I've played it with though.

This is a wonderfully designed game that I almost always enjoy playing. The mechanics are so connected and the game is well balanced. If I would have to pick one co-op game to keep in my collection, this would be the one.

Impressive game, sort of Arkham Horror lite. There are some unfortunate issues with the game -- the pawns are too big for the board AND the board itself is sort of smallish compared to games like TTR. Also, while the short playing time can be seen as a good thing, it is also sort of anti-climatic, especially considering the amount of planning that goes into playing the game itself. Basically I think Arkham Horror is too much and this is maybe too little.

EDIT -- After a few more plays, I am addicted to this game and really appreciate how well it is designed.

A fun cooperative game.  Rating may improve with more plays.

Further comments (6/30/09):  None of my gaming groups really got into this one.  Yes, it's fun, but it plays out in a similar manner each game and the biggest differentiation is in which role you have this time.  In addition, there's a distinct potential for a leader or dominant force to arise and take control (though this can occur with almost any coop).  Still, it's a fantastic coop and a great game (which is why it rates so highly for me).

Definitely worth checking out.  I'm glad I own a copy, even though I don't play it very often.

RATING: 7
The game is pretty good and I enjoy trying to save the world (and being defeated quite often).
However, and although it seemed like a positive aspect, the fact that it's a cooperative game can lead to a very uncomfortable experience. I've played it less than 10 times and that's been enough to see how some players can feel like they are not playing at all. I mean, when it's their turn, they usually do what someone else tells them to do, either because it's their first time playing or because there is an alpha gamer.

RATING: 6.5
I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Pandemic is a fine game. It's clearly very well designed and it's simple enough to be a gateway/family game... but I wasn't particularly impressed by it, maybe also due to the hype that surrounds this title. Concerning the production, while both components and artwork are very high quality, I don't particularly like the overall look of the game on the table. It's not bad of course, but it doesn't really meet my taste... especially for the strong blue on the board, that after a while almost hurts my eyes. 

Gameplay-wise instead the action points system is simple and quick enough. I like it, but on the other hand I don't find it particularly interesting or exciting. My biggest problem with the game is instead the strong luck factor. This might still be a wrong perception, given my limited amount of plays, but I feel like winning or losing depended too much on the card draws. I'm not saying of course that the players play no role in the result of the game, but if the cards come out in the wrong order, it doesn't seem that there's much to do about it. I really don't like that.

I think that Pandemic really deserves credit for innovating and bringing life to the cooperative genre, when it came out. It's a nice game with a cool theme and simple mechanisms, that make it perfect for families... but it's not the amazing game I was expecting. I like it enough that I wouldn't mind to play it again every now and then, but that's about it.

:thumbsup: The different roles are unique enough to keep each one interesting with various synergistic strategies to pursue.
:thumbsup: The rules and mechanics are very easy to learn and understand, keeping every play flowing smoothly.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]There is no set path to victory and the game is quite a challenge, even at the lowest difficulty setting.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The theme is a bit depressing, yet it feels somewhat disconnected from the mechanics.

:thumbsdown: The size of the pawns is a little too large for the game board, which makes locating specific cities difficult at times.
:thumbsdown: Luck is the true driver behind each play, and outcomes can only be influenced or improved in rare instances.

Um dos mais famosos jogos cooperativos já feitos. Interessante, porém ele é daqueles com receita de bolo: você aprende uma estratégia básica que geralmente funciona com certos personagens e consegue vencer o jogo. As expansões acrescentam muito ao jogo que acaba se tornando um bom jogo de fato.

Upate: com a recém lançada expansão No Limite (On the Brink) o jogo realmente brilha. Dá a opção do quinto jogador (como player ou bio terrorista), mais uma doença e um upgrade visual bem legal ao jogo.

Co-op king, undisputed. We've played it enough now to have 'figured it out' thus removing the challenge. Thankfully the first two expansions increase the difficulty just enough to keep it fresh.

On saying that, the newer expansions and spin-offs leave a bit to be desired. I feel Pandemic has run its course now and it might be time to hang up the crown.

I thought this was a keeper the first few times, because it seemed to be the ideal gateway game for my family. I now think co-op games are better played among more hardened gamers, both because it's too easy for one person to boss everyone around in a gamer+non-gamers situation, and because non-gamers can find the savage punishment 'we're all going to die' nature of a co-op a real downer.

Among gamers, this is way better.  My most enjoyable games of Pandemic have come when all players are autonomous planners, card information is not completely shared, and a kind of brains trust emerges.  But having said that, I am a little concerned that in a game where player interests are perfectly aligned, it seems irrational not to be just laying our cards down to show each other right away...

I quite like this game, but am not always in the mood for it. Games have the tendency to go the same way if you always play with the same group of people (that's a beauty of legacy - changes with every game!), and sometimes when luck is against you it's impossible. All in all, a game I enjoy, but not a game I always feel like playing.

The shuffling mechanic which causes certain cities to reinfect repeatedly (and gives you information about where the diseases will be coming from) is brilliant.I like the short length, which is much better for a cooperative game.  I also like how this game is not about just learning the strategy of what you need to do (how you need to spend your resources), and then having the person who knows the correct strategy dictate to the others what to do.  Rather, its actually a complicated tactical puzzle, one that actually benefits from having more than one brain thinking about it, and discussing it.  This game made me realize that cooperative games need to be promarily tactical, not strategic in nature, and need to be tactically difficult enough that anyone is going to need help from their partners in figuring it out, thus leading to true cooperation, not just the experienced player dictating moves to the rest (like in Shadows and in LotR).

One of the best introductions into contemporary boardgames. The consensual and simple theme can be understood and embraced by everybody : let's save the world from diseases!

The cooperative nature allows one to help players with the rules during play, and creates a lively discussion around the table about strategies.

The game has a spatial element which reminds of risk, each player has a role ensuring that s/he will play an unique and important role during play. The game has great pacing, with escalating stakes, and plays in under one hour. The game mechanics are simple and can be played by kids, who are really grabbed by the theme.

As a co-op game, I actually felt it was cumbersome. The logic of disease spread is similar to games like zombie state and the like. The player powers are nothing new. The game is a form of ticket to ride cum cube placement and removal (Pick up and deliver feeling??).

Having said that, the game systems have been proven to work and now is used in this thematic situation to its best.

Overall, a very enjoyable game with the right group and light enough to be enjoyed by all ages.

Classic co-op game nice theme and great infection mechanic.

Various levels of difficulty with the hardest one being next to impossible.

Playable solo although not recommended, a group of friends can readily enjoy it.

Since its not too deep there is no reason to alpha other players and can be played if the group wants a coop game but with quick rules explanation and short gameplay.

Can be played even 3 times in a row if the previous tries result in a quick outbreak game over.

RATING: 7.4
Pandemic is about players combined their efforts to save the world from 4 diseases.  Players can be one of the 5 characters which has their own individual abilites.  Players may draw epidemic cards which will hasten the spread of the diseases.

It is a race against time to save the world.  Players have to find the cure of 4 diseases before 8 outbreaks of diseases, depletion of city cards or one of the disease cubes has been depleted.  

Good points:  It is a easy game and players can learn the game easily.  Players can increase the difficulty of the game by adding more epidemic cards among the city cards.  The game can be exciting when players draw epidemic cards and hasten the spread of the diseases while players frantically tries to treat the diseases.

Bad points: The game can be exciting, but it can also be boring.  The excitment of the game really depends on the time, the epidemic cards appear and the appearance of which infection cards that affects the cities.  Sometimes, from the start of the game, players are able to determine the outcome of the game.  Only at times, the game is an even match and entertaining to the players.

2010(?) Hexer Von Salem does the same job ten times better.

Pandemic is a perfectly likable and easy to learn cooperative game, but the maths just isn't hidden well enough and as a result the theme just doesn't shine like that later rival.

Given the choice between the two I would never choose Pandemic

UPDATE 2013: I have changed my mind - certainly with the expansion(s) Pandemic is much better than I remember. There's also no substitute for a game simple enough to teach in this short time 5>7

ANOTHER UPDATE 2014: I have never been so wrong! 7>8.5

YET ANOTHER UPDATE 2017: As I sail past 50 plays, plus 18 plays of the first season of legacy, this game represents probably the most inaccurate first impression I have ever had. Defines the genre, for me.

Very well done co-operative game - very enjoyable. Recommend easy mode for new players. The strongest role is Dispatcher, the most important role is the Medic, the Scientist is the least needed role, and the Operations Expert and Researcher are medium important. Normal mode with four players is quite challenging - lost 2 of 2, with the second loss by 1 player turn only. Finally won 1 game in normal mode with 3 players, the Medic, Scientist, Researcher, and lucky disease setup with most diseases in blue and yellow regions. Easy mode with 5-players challenging for newcomers - next time, pick roles since new player had dispatcher and found it complicated. 2015 UPDATE: Still a great puzzle game with a good enough theme. A classic!

Alright for a night when we don't feel like competing. This is our only co-op game in the collection, and will likely stay that way for quite some time.

We have a success rate of 50% right now. The draw of characters seems to be a big reason for our success/failure. Maybe we just need to develop stronger strategies for the character combinations.

As said before, co-ops aren't really my cup of tea, as successes feel anti-climactic and losses feel like a waste of time. No joy regardless which defeats my interest in board games.

This is a game I might use for non-gamers to get them into the hobby.

Routinely play this with family, and we're not a board-gaming family. The cooperative nature, fun puzzling aspect of coordinating each other's moves, easy to like theme with broad appeal (not too nerdy, but not boring), and ease of learning contribute to it being a big hit. We never play just one game. Even without expansions, it hasn't started feeling repetitive. I've managed to get people who don't care much for board games interested in playing this one.

Months on: I love ramping up the difficulty in this game.  It is regularly brought to holiday gatherings and replays are often requested. I still do not have the expansion, and it's still my favorite.

почитал правила. выглядит любопытно (и я бы сказал, что "Большой пожар" больше похож на "Запретный остров", чем "Пандемия"), но мне показалось, что игра больше рассчитана на 4 игрока. всё, что меняется при игре на двоих - каждый получает в стартовую руку четыре карты, а не две. 

дополнение "На грани" вводит ряд новых механизмов, основной из которых (судя по объёму текста в правилах) - "Биотеррорист", предатель среди игроков (все знают, кто он за столом, но на поле он скрывается), для него рекомендуется 3-4 игрока.

после первой партии убедились, что это апгрейженый "Запретный остров". неплохая игра, но то ли было слишком просто, то ли мы уже привыкли к милому оформлению острова, в общем не могу сказать, что были в восторге.

I like it and everything, but this is the opposite of a gateway game for me.  I love teaching games, but I do not like playing this one with people who are new to it.  I either have to watch as the game kicks their butts, or I have to basically play solo (telling others what to do), which is no fun for anyone.  So, for me, I only like playing this with those who at least have an idea of how the roles work together.

Our very first proper board game and what a game at that. We bought it as a couple and at first were a little overwhelmed by all the rules but we preserved and were certainly rewarded with a marvellous game. The co-operative nature of the game was intriguing as a new comer. It allowed us to navigate the rules together and develop strategy. The game allows for a lot of excitement as it is often quite tense and a wrong decision can lead to the end of the word! Would highly recommend as an introduction to the world of gaming but you will keeping coming back to it forever because it is such fun.

I had played Pandemic a total of two times in 2009 before picking it up at a post-holiday sale in the mall for $18. The two games I had did not really give me a fair representation of the game. The first game was a learning game in which all the players involved were new to the game and struggling the rules. The second play was months after the first and I had to re-learn the rules again, so it was more like a first play. Both times I played I saw some potential in the game; I loved the Epidemic mechanic, and the fact that players had to interact and plan together in order to be successful, but I didn't like it enough to buy it.

I bought the game because I love playing games with my family and this seemed like a nice fit for us. It seemed light enough for my parents to handle, hard enough to keep us coming back, and the fact that it was co-op meant that I could play with my family with out stressing them out with my "play to win" attitude.

After a few plays of this game, I can say that I am sorry I didn't pick up this game earlier. This has taken a seat along side Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, and Settlers of Catan as one of my family's favorite games to play. The variability in difficulty is great, because I can set it to easy for my family and harder for when my girlfriend and I play this two player. I can see this game getting a lot of play in 2010. It deserves it. For a game that can be knocked out in 45 minutes it accomplishes a lot.

A really great co-op game. Works well no matter how many you have, (though only goes up to four). Easy to pick up and interesting dynamics. Played quite a few times now and it's still excellent, and each game is different enough so you don't feel like you're doing it all over again.

RATING: 6
Decent puzzle/co-op with a fairly unique (although incredibly abstracted!) theme. Accessible to almost anyone. But I always stress that each player's turn is *their turn*. Advice must be solicited and all information about their hand must be volunteered. 

This makes the game much more interesting, I think. Cuts down on one player quarterbacking everyone's moves. But it's still just a decent co-op. Nothing about it is particularly exciting.

RATING: 6
I understand why this game is a strong gateway game, but I've noticed that both Zee Garcia and Rahdo have this as their favorite game, despite the thousands of games that they have played, and that rather mystifies me.

The general complaint with many games is that they are insufficiently play tested and unbalanced by certain cards/dice rolls/etc. Pandemic, I would argue, is a game that suffers by being too well play tested. It feels, as you play it, like everything was carefully measured out so that the game play would happen exactly like this every time you play it:

1. The players act freely, doing the obvious thing, without really needing to put much effort into coordination or thinking.
2. Until the very last round, when *gasp* we can't win!
3. And then everyone puts their heads together, and *gasp* exactly 50% of the time, there is a special card or special power which allows them to solve the problem. And they win if there is, and lose if there isn't.

I enjoy stage 3, and would play a game that is stage 3 throughout the whole game. But 95% of the game is stage 1. The whole game ends up being an elaborate randomizer to determine the state of the game on the last round, and it has been so finely tuned to be this way that I don't feel like there will ever be a game which doesn't play out exactly as said. You could set your clock to the thing.

From a mechanical, perfectly crafted "thrill the non-gamers with a well-themed coop" sense, it's a great game. It knows what it needs to do to appeal to the average person and will do it every single time. But I'm not part of that audience. If I'm playing a co-op, I want to have to coordinate with my team and come up with solutions through the whole thing, not just once.

Good, light co-op that is easy to learn and not particularly hard.  Has a fair amount of randomness, though gaming that randomness is an important part of the system.  Suffers from quarterbacking, though.  I'll play it, have gotten many good plays out of it, but will pick Ghost Stories over it if I have 4 (Pandemic is better than GS with 2/3 though).

Pandemic is a winner for me because of the co-operative nature of the game and the theme. It's definitely more of an adults game.

The only drawbacks I have with the game are that I wish you could play with 5 players easier (there are 5 roles in the box but the game is said to be designed for only 4) but if you adhere to the rule on running out of cards acting as a game-ender it's not really possible to play with a fifth player.

All in all a great game though!

In my groups opinion, we find the game kinda unbalanced. Some games we find crushingly hard and almost impossible, and then the nest time we play we almost sequence break the game and feel it's too easy. That being said, I personally love the game. The multiple characters, variable power, the accessible theme and game play, and the co-operation makes this one a high one on my list.

Easy to learn and to play. It feels more fun than LOTR collaborative.

Well balanced at the standard level with 4 players, with most games being just won or just lost on the final turn (before the deck runs out).

With 2 players it seemed a bit too easy (counter-intuitively) and my father-in-law and I were able to win on the Advanced level. Whereas with 4 players we have never come close to winning on advanced.

It's a great implementation. The theme, components, and design are all very slick (I don't consider it to be "dry"). There can be a significant "leader bosses everybody around" component, but if you're cognizant of this you can avoid that. Scales well (harder with more players!) and, though it feels like a puzzle, retains its fun and challenge.

The pacing is really slick also, with the game starting out almost too slowly, but once an epidemic comes out it generally cascades into chaos such that endgames are legitimately tense. A great design.

A fairly quick cooperative game, and probably a good one to get non-gamers into the hobby.  The mechanics are simple, but the game can still be challenging.  I'm not sure if this is because a certain number of games are unwinnable due to sheer dumb luck, or if this is because to frequently win you have to be somewhere on the learning curve that I haven't reached.

Either way, it's still enjoyable, and seems to work well for a variety of people, so I'd assume it will work for most groups.  

There is some imbalance between the characters, which is unfortunate, but in a cooperative game it's less of a big deal.  There is also the issue of do-what-the-strongest-player-says, but it seems like this is almost a universal feature of cooperative games, and Pandemic isn't necessarily worse than the others.

Fun game as a whole.  Promotes a good challenge for the team.  My version includes the quarantine specialist and the contingency planner.  For some reason, though, I feel like they are not always as strong as some other characters.  The success of the game can seem to rely on the combination of team you are dealt.  

Good game to return to from time to time because of its cooperative strategy element.

Terra has a similar theme plus a tension between acting in your own interests or playing cooperatively, Shadows Over Camelot has the traitor.  Both would have been much less fun as purely cooperative games.  Pandemic is a purely cooperative game.  

Pandemic models the spread of disease quite well and generates some tension through the infection and epidemic cards.  It is about making use of the various character specialisms as efficiently as possible.  Increasing the number of epidemic cards in the deck allows less room for sub-optimal play.  All perfectly competent, but I don't find this puzzle very interesting and there's nothing else going on.

I really like this game. I wish my group liked it more. I plan on giving Legacy a try, eventually. Since I've become the one person that ever wants to play the game in my group I've been reduced to mostly just playing the app on my iPad. The app does not have the bioterrorist mechanics though, so the game with the OTB expansion offers a differing experience.

It takes a very clever design to make a coop game work without a traitor/defector mechanic, and Pandemic delivers.

Plus, the theme is great.

- A simple and yet entertaining game system. 
- The games are exciting and fast-paced. The game length is moving at around 25-45 minutes. 
- Very cleverly elaborated topic. 
- Variable difficulty. 
- It is necessary to cooperate. 
- Fun and playable in even 2 or more players. Solo play is also possible (the player will play several characters).  
- Entertaining even after many games. 
- It can take a rare players as well as experienced players. Quickly explaination of rules. 
- Some game material is somewhat minimalist (wooden cubes and classic wooden figures), but for this game it fits.
- Sympathetic size of box and the board (game does not need much space). 
- The influence of chance is adequate for gameplay, fun and thrill of the game. 
- Set up of the game is quite fast. 

CONS:
- Dominant players can theoretically take the reins of the game (but it never happened in our case). 
- Some cities on the map are shown somewhat confusingly (mainly in Asia), so sometimes the site is looking a while. 
- Some of characters are more powerful than the others.

CONCLUSION:
Best cooperative boardgame I've ever played. A brisk, exciting (sometimes it's really adrenalin), fun... and yet rules can be explained in a few minutes. Pandemic clearly belongs to our most popular games. And I highly recommend the expansion.

If you like coöp games, this is a must have. You can choose how difficult you want to make it by changing the number of virus cards, so you can start the game at an entry level. Different characters demand you to play the game differently, so high replay ability.

At first I enjoyed this game, but after around 10 plays I have gotten concerned that: 
1) The game is too easy to win (even on heroic setting). 
2) A dominating player can overrule the decisions of other participants, because the game is more a puzzle with one solution than a true coop exerience.

As a puzzle for 10-12 year old kids I rate it a 10, but as a coop game for grown-ups I can only rate it a 6.

I consider this game as a standard for all cooperative games. It's a brain burning game that is driven by some randomness, but nothing you really can't take into account. It's a hard game to win with many difficulty levels. 

It doesn't scale perfectly, as it becomes more hard with more players. Totally soloable game, even in multiplayer solitaire, and really enjoyable.

I like the new disign, and the components are of incredibly good quality. It's a pleasure to adds those translucent cubes, even if they mean you will lose soon.

Can be very difficult on 4 player without the 'Researcher' role that allows the free giving of cards for curing diseases, to the point it feels unachievable.

Enjoyable co-operative game, which never has a guaranteed win.

Pandemic is an excellent game, and particularly great for introducing player to co-op board games.
Personally, I find the base game lacks a degree of variety.  I liked it from day one, but almost never wanted to play it because you knew what to expect every game.  In my opinion the expansion "On the Brink" is almost a requirement.  It honestly fixes every issue I had with the game, plus adds better, more manageable components.  With OtB, Pandemic is an easy 9 for me.

I'm really not that big a fan of cooperative board games (I'd rather play cooperatively in a video game), but Pandemic can provide some amusement from time to time.  If anything, the mechanics are solid, the components amazing, and the tension... absent.  What can I say?  If I'm playing a board game I want to beat my fellow gamers or at least have the theme and gameplay be a bit more interesting than "give all of your blues to the scientist" and other similar gobbledygook.

This is the game that started it for us. Well, in reality, it was the first episode of TableTop we ever watched. We started watching TableTop when a link to it showed up after a webisode of Felicia Day's FLOG. And we've been board gamers ever since.  WHEAAAAAAATOOOOOOON! (Any Big Bang Theory fans out there?)
Anyway ... this has to be one of our top 5 games. A thinky adventuresome puzzle that has you sweating from start to finish. You never know what will happen next. Never assume you've won until that last disease is cured! Just when you least expect it Pandemic can leave you a quivering bloody mess (figuratively speaking) on the lab floor. Wash your hands and expect the unexpected.

Es un juego genial para pasar una tarde divertida incluso con gente que no está acostumbrada a los juegos de mesa.

This is a more advanced and decision driven version of Forbidden Island/Forbidden Desert style game. For those who enjoy cooperative games I think this is one of the "must haves" due to it's length (20-30min) depth (mild but decisions are important/key), and unique medical theme.
 
This game also has plenty of expansions and intricacies to keep it entertaining for the long run. At this point there are at least 3 expansions adding additional diseases, player competition, and disease mutations.

I love this co-op game. I play mostly with my husband. We're not good enough for this game to be boring yet. Games are of appropriate length, and we cheer when we think we're winning, and curse right when the tides turn against us. 

The "intensify" cards are pure genius, and feels thematically perfect as a mechanic. The only downside is that each game does feel very "same-y" so it's hard to play this multiple times in a row.

First play was a bit disappointing, I think some rules were played wrong and there was a bit of "directing" going on instead of co-operating. Would like to play again.

Bought my own copy and have had a few games and now that I understand a bit more it is enjoyable. Good fun but sooooo hard even on easy. Looking forward to the first win

Way Hey! We've had some wins, and have now moved to the normal difficulty. Even harder but still do-able with a bit of luck and timing. Heroic: one game so far and we were trounced. But we WILL get there!

We have got there! 2 player game win on Heroic, and there was much rejoycing.

We can now usually win on Heroic barring a really bad card draw. Can't wait for the expansion

Amazingly clever cooperative game that brings tension and challenging decisions on every turn. Tough decisions include treating disease to avoid outbreaks, trading and saving up sets of cards to find cures, and building research stations to set up easy movement for future turns.

Great thematic design with the outbreaks and epidemics. The Intensify stage during Epidemics in which the discard pile gets shuffled and placed back on top of the draw pile is genius.

Great game.  I love the cooperative nature, and how you can work together to solve the puzzle.  The roles, while not balanced, still have their part to play.  There's a high level of tension, and I must say that I'm glad not to really be having to cure all those diseases.  I look forward to playing it in the more advanced levels - we have to beat the easy mode first.

Yes, as everyone will surely tell you, Pandemic is a great game.

A globe-trotting cooperative game about wiping out four emergent superbugs. Almost disastrously difficult, but it just makes you want to try again! UPDATE: having won vs. 6 cards three times now, I'm getting a little smug about the game. Still fun though! UPDATE: Pandemic is still fun, but the rating has settled into a natural-feeling 7.

I finally got to play this game with the right group of people. I'd say the right group of people are willing to communicate, but not push each other around. Even more important is the desire to solve problems dynamically.  The first time I played was with people were not interested in suspense and simple thought the game brutalized them.  The game is all meat and no fat. No convoluted rules can be found.

Simply great: it's quick (max. one hour), challenging (if chosen, the difficulty level can be easily adjusted), and games are usually very different from each other due to the random drawing mechanism and the large number of available roles (see expansions).

Traded.

One of the few games my wife asked for the second round right after the first. I'm slightly less interested for some reason, at least for now. This was the one of the first games that caught my eye when I entered this hobby, so I've been longing to get my copy for a while. When I finally did, I've played variety of other games and amazed by them and lost interest on this somewhat simplistic game. Also thought that I'd enjoy this solo but it didn't really clicked in solo as much in multi player. I believe the conversation is a big part of the game than its mechanics, at least more so that I initially thought. After all I enjoy playing, in fact we've never even won a game yet. Wife's ranking is like 9.

[co-op, 2-4p]

==2018/01/01==
Pandemic is probably the perfect co-op.  The genre is what I dislike, not the game's craftsmanship.  I'd rather buy expansions to this game than buy other co-ops.

It's just solving a puzzle with other people.  Which is fun!  But it's not a play/counter-play game like most of my other games.

I love this game.  

Yes, it's a co-op.  Yes, it's subject to "Alpha gamer" syndrome.  Yes, it's puzzle-like.  Yes, there is some luck involved.

But by evaluating the probabilities and managing both your resources and your characters' special powers, making decisions and pressing your luck have never been so fraught with tension and dread.

This is mostly a tactical style game where you control pawns to do certain things to benefit your team (and cure diseases). I like the harder levels. The biggest problem is that you can have one player dominate what happens, and other players don't think or do things for themselves.

As a collection of game mechanics, this is one smart design.  Its tight, clean, and challenging.  The various characters are interesting enough to give each a bit of variety.  They could use more.  The short coming in this otherwise very good game has to do with people.  The game can easily be dominated by one person's leadership direction.  When this happens, the other players are going through the motions of moving the pawns in someone else's game.  The rules don't have teeth to prevent this from happening.  That said, I'm not sure what the solution to the problem is.  It's not likely the fault of the game.

A classic that I will include on my list of gateway games. This is one of those games that you can talk most newcomers into playing by asking them, "Do you want to save the world?" Pandemic is a co-op where all players work together towards a common goal - save the world from rampant diseases. Everyone picks a character card with a unique ability, and the four viruses are set up to begin infecting the human race at an incredible rate. Your job is to stop the epidemics and save humanity. It's pretty cool. No one has to feel the pressure to compete, but as with most co-ops, winning the game is not so easy. With this game, you get simple rules, quick playthroughs, and lots of player interaction. 7/10

RATING: 8
 This one looks interesting. First impressions are that I'm disappointed that the cards seem very inexpensive, and since you keep the epidemic cards out while shuffling the whole deck, it is easy to tell which cards are epidemics, because they are crisp and unused.  I guess that this is once game where the cards might need to be sleeved.

Looks very hard to win.  It will be interesting to see the strategies unfold.  Medic seems an especially important role.

In a good group, this is a fantastic co-op strategy game.

RATING: 8
Once we sorted out all the mistakes we were making with the rules, it became much more challenging.  The randomness of the draw bears heavy making some games significantly easier than others.  We play with random roles assigned and have found more fun in figuring out the best strategy to play with different role combinations.  This is keeping the replay-ability going after dozens, if not exceeding 100, plays.

[ESP] Sin duda uno de los mejores cooperativos. Posibilidad de ajustar la dificultad; existe el riesgo de que alguien lleve siempre la voz cantante y predomine sobre el resto.

I tend to either love or easily tire of co-op games.  Pandemic joins Knizia's LoTR as my favorite true co-op.  It edges LoTR out merely in time to set-up and play.  LoTR can be an undertaking to explain enough details so that players enjoy their first time through the game, while Pandemic is fast enough that even if the players don't quite get everything that is going on, they can try again immediately.

The game varies quite a lot because of the roles you get and where in the world viruses spread.

Co-op games are a strange beast: Usually one person knows how to play the game.  Either that person dominates the play for everyone, or the person knowingly accepts poor strategies from the others.

I liked this but didn't "love" it.  The gameplay seemed very mechanical.  I also didn't like that (unlike, say, in Arkham Horror) it seemed like you weren't really playing your own role.  Each move was a group collective decision and usually there was one move agreed upon as being "best" in any given situation.  There was never a time for independant thought or action.  I realize it's a "group cooperative" game, so part of it is working together, but this was more than just working together.  It was like a group puzzle solving party.

Played this with my dad, completed the introductory level no problems asked. My dad is not used to this type of game, but thankfully there weren't many rules to keep track of. A good introductory game, will have to try it with 4 players... However the introduction-level is very easy (well if you've ever played Ghost stories most any co-op game is easy) so I'd almost suggest people playing their first game at one of the higher levels (unless they play with players who might be turned of a game on losing on the first try).

A moderately fun cooperative game.  After a couple of plays, I think that this game's replay value might be a little lacking.  I'll have to play it more to see, but it seems like Pandemic's simplicity might get stale after a while.  It is nice to have a co-op game besides Arkham, especially one that plays in 45 minutes.

I have to tank the rating a bit, because we've never won even after about 8 plays, although it has been close a few times.

Edit: We win all the time, now.  It's good - not great.

RATING: 6
Pandemic is simply upstaged by Mage Knight and Space Alert at their player counts - but at three players, Pandemic is probably the best choice for cooperative gaming. It's also just super-elegant and is the perfect example of what I call "stochastic event timing" in the form of the Epidemic cards. I still don't own this one, and I think I wouldn't play it enough to justify the purchase. It also seems like recent games like Flash Point: Fire Rescue and Atlantis Rising might end up being more interesting to me.

The cooperative play is great angle.  To even win on normal is quite a challenge.  The luck aspect is pretty high, but now I pretty much expect to lose, ending the game with a post-mortem phase of reflecting on what we could have done differently.

The replay value has been very high so far.

I'm not sure what running out of cards means in real world terms.  Even if the cures are just about finished, I suppose the research funding is pulled and all of humanity dies.

Buen juego colaborativo de atajar la expansión de epidemias por el mundo. Muy sencillo de reglas, fácil de explicar y corto de duración... Tiene dos problemas: uno que al final y como en casi todos los colaborativos (a excepcion el Arkham Horror) acaba mandando uno y siguiendo el resto. El otro problema que tuvo fue el Hype que lo acompañó... yo me lo compré por lo muchísimo que se habló de él. No me arrepiento, pero no es para tanto. La siguiente y última compra de hype fue el Dominion... pá qué hablaros...

A wonderful puzzle. Because of the card order and multiple difficulty levels, the game can have a lot of replay. However, unlucky card order can beat even the best strategy.

RATING: 7.5
First of all, a million thanks to wifwendell for this wonderful gift! It's the first board game I ever receive as a gift, and what a wonderful game it is!

Now, for the game itself. Having played only a couple times with my wife by now, I can agree on all it's hype. It's a great game, full of very interesting decisions. The fact that there are those random card draws make the game play every time completely different, and the roles really add up to the experience. I'm looking forward to play it with more people, but for now, it's a solid 9.

UPDATE: I still like it a lot, but no longer want to play it all the time. Down to an 8.

One of my favorite Co-op game so far.  It's got an engaging theme that appeals to a broad group of people.  It plays fast and furious with little downtime (most games will play to completion in an hour).  

It's also a pretty finely tuned game.  The difference between winning and losing seems to always come down to one single turn.

recommended.

RATING: 8
This is more a solo game than a cooperative one because each player has a hand of cards but unless you show your cards to others there's not much cooperation at all, so you have all the information laid open on the table.
You can play solo and use 2 to 4 roles. The 2013 game version has 7 roles (the original game had 5).
You move on the board trying to cure the 4 diseases while at the same time not letting these expand too much.
Maybe the roles are not completely balanced, the medic seems the strongest role. Other roles seem weaker, for example the dispacher in a 2 player game. The contingency planner (1 of the new roles) can reuse an event card, if the event cards come later in the game, this role is almost useless half of the game, whereas the medic or the scientist (cures with 4 cards instead of 5) are always helpful throughout the game.

Received this game in Dec 2015.  I hadn't played board games in a long time and this one introduced me to the new board game world that is out there and now here I am on BBG.  My 13 y/o son and I love playing this game.  Yes, this is clearly a gateway game.  

Looking forward to playing the expansion packs.

Great game. Very popular with both gamers and non-gamers. Nothing here to dislike, plays well, scales well and game length is just about right. Theme proving very popular with both gamers and non-gamers. Simple to teach this has elevated the co-op genre of gaming to a new and higher level and will taking some matching in the future. An exceptional game on many levels.

FLW "as long as this isn't _______ we'll be fine". so many tense moments that make the group invested and leads to many simultaneous heartbreaks and cheers depending on the cards that are drawn. of the number of times we've beat the game (far less than the times we've lost) it always felt like we earned it.

Get ready for the next big gateway game. Pandemic has the same approachability as Ticket to Ride but has the potential to be an even bigger hit because of: a) the more thematic, cooperative and immersive experience; b) quick pace (~30min); c) 3 levels of difficulty; d) tons of replayability with both the combination of role cards as well as seed conditions; e) potential for expansion maps and roles. This is the 1st cooperative game I've played where dialogue and clear communication among all players was key to solving the game. Matt Leacock's latest published design is an elegant, streamlined and well-crafted masterpiece.

RATING: 7
Great game to introduce someone to co-operative play. The theme interacts with the mechanics excellently - the way epidemics and outbreaks occur feels like a disease spreading which not only keeps players engaged but also makes it easier to understand and react to. 

If I had never played the expansion, I may have rated this game higher. The lack of game modes and relative lack of role cards really hurts it by comparison, however; I find that after playing the base game a few times in a row everything starts to feel "same-y" for lack of a better word. Every one reaches the same conclusions about strategy because there are only a few differences each time; it's only possible to gain and lose one role, and there are no challenges.

One of those coop games you don't really know if you'll win till the very last moment. If you want a game to keep you on your toes from boot to finish, this is it. The variable difficulty mechanism is a clever way to regulate tension and max playtime is capped since once the card pile is exhausted, the game ends, something I found very convenient and suiting.

Not sure if I really really love this game yet.
It's growing on me and I think I'll love it when we all get our heads around balancing.

I do look forward to the expansion changes and making it harder than the base 4 epidemic cards.

update:
yep very cool. It's surprising how much harder it is with 5 epidemics. I really can't see how it's possible to win with 7 epidemics (legendary mode).

One of the best co-op games.  Offers a great challenge and an exciting theme.  Games are very tense and can change on a dime.  I dislike the way the infection deck is shuffled.  You see too many of the same cards which I suppose is the point.  It also just allows an alpha gamer to take control where the other players are just pawns for him/her.  It also can be a bit tricky to teach.  I would recommend Forbidden Island, made by the same creator, over Pandemic.

The problem with this game is that one player can get himself into a role of leader who's telling others what should they do as their best move, therefore ruining others'  enjoyment. To prevent this we played with a homerule that cards in hand are open but communication between players is forbiddden. With this rule the leader problem was solved but the game still wasn't very exciting.

RATING: 7
Co-op game that has a great theme and great replay-ability, but is a touch on the dry side.  Newer printings appear to have spiced things up visually, but at the end of the day you are just trying to pull cubes off the board.  Great for an intro to co-op gaming that has more depth and theme than forbidden island.

Maybe the expansions are better and I'm sure Legacy is the jam but pandemic is just a game of probability, nothing more.  It's okay I guess.

Great cooperative game, with lots of tension, and very scalable (though I must mention that number of players influences the difficulty, with 2p being the easiest). It's funny for both casual and experienced players.

The deck reseeding mechanic triggered by epidemic cards, causing cities to be infected again and again, is one of the most brilliant mechanics in the whole boardgame world.

One of the most intriguing aspects of Pandemic is the pace of the game: the tension grows with the increasing number of outbreaks, while players race to find the cures, and the finale is often very climatic (even when losing)!

Pandemic is hands down the best cooperative game around (said by a guy that's not in love with coops), with the possible exception of Space Alert (that is on a league of its own, being an ingenious out of the norm design, and that's definitely more a gamers' game...)!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Each time I play this game, I like it more and more.  There are certainly combinations of roles that make the game easier, but even with a 'best case' scenario in terms of roles, things can blow up very fast if you have an outbreak chain reaction.

Simple and fun.

RATING: 6
Pandemic's popularity cannot be denied; and it's a solid medium-weight game. It's heralded as a great gateway game, though I find it better suited for casual board game aficionados curious about venturing deeper into the hobby, rather than enticing new people. The rules and numerous action choices aren't as easy to grasp for non-gamers as many other choices, though cooperative games are always appealing for those who are uneasy about competition. Personally, I find the theme to be a hindrance as well; it evokes the fear of disease epidemics so prevalent in the media, which can be off-putting for some, and for this reason I rarely pull it off the shelf. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played through and thought it was okay.  Wasn't blown away or anything.  Will probably need to play more before, I can give it a more accurate score.  Having played through it, didn't really give me a sense that I wanted to play again.  Maybe I need to get an expansion or two to enjoy it more.  Need to do a bit more research into this.

I like this game a lot and it has so much tension.  A lot has been said about this by others.  It really is very good, and so often the game comes down to only one turn.  The randomization of it means I have had a couple games where we simply had amazing draws, cured a disease in two turns, and there just wasn't the tension that I love from the game.  I know the randomness of the game is what keeps it replayable, but those chances to just win keep the game a bit lower for me.  Oddly enough, I enjoy the times where we get randomly killed by the game... I suppose because I like the very strong us vs. the game feel Pandemic engenders.

This game is hard! The main drawback to this game is that if you have a strong willed person, it'll end up being a 4-player game with 1 person making all of the decisions and the other 3 just waiting to see what happens. 
I enjoyed the coop game and the strategy involved, but have yet to beat the game. Very well game design and I hope to beat it soon!
Update: Beat it! Played with a neighbor, me being the scientist and him the medic. It was played with 4 epidemic cards (all of which he drew) and reached 5 or 6 outbreaks. If we had different classes I think it would have been difficult to beat the game as easily as it felt. Here's to another!

Really hate the kind of quarterbacking this game promotes. Also hate that you can do "optimal" moves and still lose, or play terribly and still win just because you get lucky card draws. An exercise in frustration that, if every condition is perfect, can be at best an OK game.

This game is great. I've it's cooperative game play is revolutionary, and it amazes me every time I play. This is the game that made me love boardgames as much as I do. It's rules are simple and straightforward, but still requires a great deal of strategy.

RATING: 6
When this was first released I wasn't a big fan.  I played several games that were either terrible losses or easy wins.  Now that I own Pandemic Legacy I went back and played several more of this base game in preparation and had a different experience.  It's still possible to get those swingy games, but player actions have more of an impact than they seem at first.

I think there are some tricky considerations.  1) Some characters play better as teams, e.g., Dispatcher and Medic vs Generalist and anyone.  2) For all players to have fun, they all need to be approximately the same experience level and be about the same amount engaged (which means they all need to be able to contribute equally to this sort of logic puzzle). Otherwise, one player is probably going to dominate everyone's actions in the interest of efficiency/victory.  3) The game's apparent randomness decreases significantly once everyone understands how the infection deck works and specifically how that interacts with epidemics.  4) The game will always be random...if you get two epidemic cards back-to-back, or if every epidemic city outbreaks immediately.

So this is in no way my favorite cooperative game...that might be Lord of the Rings, even though it's so much longer.  There's also Forbidden Island/Desert, which have re-used these mechanics in a much more entertaining fashion.  And if you like the traitor mechanic then those games (e.g., Battlestar Galactica) neatly solve the problem of one player controlling all the characters.  With all that said, I am having a blast with Pandemic Legacy.

RATING: 10
My all-time favorite co-op game; Pandemic has it all.  Fast play, deep strategy, unpredictability, and the heart-pounding excitement and stress of so many ways to lose keep me coming back over and over again.  Although harder than Forbidden Island, its rules can be picked up without too much trouble, especially since you can help each other out.

7/25/08 - I've now played this several times and I really enjoy it.  The game is fast, intense, easy to learn and highly addictive.   Each time I've taken it out to teach someone the game they've wanted to play it again immediately after we're done...  then they want to play it again and again and again - you get the picture.  I've only played a few cooperative games but this one is awesome.  The theme matches the mechanics perfectly and during each of the games I have played I have felt great hope, excitement, despair and loss.   It's awesome!   Depending on how the next month goes, I may raise this to a 10.

This game will always hold a dear spot in my heart b/c it was one of the first Euro-types we owned and learned to play well.  The two of us played it constantly for six months before our game collection expanded and we found other folks to play with (after moving to a city that has a big board game scene).  Now, with so many other titles to learn, I haven't ever really suggested playing it.  But it's really an excellent excellent game.

A super fun cooperative game that is easy and fast to set up.
AND it's a super gateway game to hook people to board games because of the following reasons:
 - It's a cooperative game. Newbies don't have to fear about their inexperience.
 - Non-nerdy theme. Everyone can think about being a doctor and cure the world.
 - Easy rules but nonetheless a hard game that can kick your butt.

But after we bought [thing=121921]Robinson Crusoe[/thing] it just didn't got on table anymore, and thus we traded it away.

RATING: 6.8
I find the game pretty irritating and way too unforgiving. Too much randomness can mean an unbeatable game during some games, the running out of player cards rule = end just seems stupid. For instance playing on the easiest difficulty, we lost because we had 1 card on the card pick up phase meaning we lose if we had the extra epidemic card in at least it would have been a turn extra making it easier then the apparent easiest mode?

I would have to say that this game was one of my favorite Christmas gifts this year.  It's always fun to try to save the world, as well as to teach new players.  They usually start out pretty skeptical, but by the time the game is over they're hooked and usually say, "That didn't take too long.  Let's go again."  Can't say that I blame them.  It's an enjoyable gaming ride.  The high ranking is quite understandable. [Gift]

[i]Posted: 4/6/10, Rated: 9[/i]
{2P: 9, 3P: 10, 4: 8}

[i]Pandemic[/i] is one of those games that gets a tremendous amount of "buzz" here on the Geek.  It is a cooperative title, which means players are working together to beat the game instead of each other.  In this case, it means they are trying to find cures to four globally-threatening diseases.  The subject matter of global epidemics isn't sexy in the slightest, but it very quickly grows on you all the same.

The amazing feature of [i]Pandemic[/i] is how refined it is.  It embodies Albert Einstein's quote, "Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler."  Each player gets four action points per turn, and can choose from a list of basic and advanced actions.  Reference cards are provided, which is always a nice touch.  She can also use her role's special power; there are five roles provided in the game.  You would think that this recipe is bland enough for the game to feel "solved," but that's not the case.  After having played over 50 games online and in person, I am still surprised by the creativity of some players.

The method of spreading disease has been perfectly implemented.  Reshuffling the discard pile onto the top of the Infection Deck after an epidemic does a wonderful job of making sick places...sicker.  You dread the "Draw 2 Player Cards" phase of your turn as you feel an epidemic lurking around the corner.  There is a sense of urgency to do as much as you can to knock down the "hot spots" before the next one strikes.  Two epidemics in rapid succession can be fatal.

The difficulty of the game can easily scale by adjusting the number of "Epidemic" cards in the Infection Deck.  Player-wise, the game doesn't scale as well: the 2 player game is almost too easy (even at "Hard" difficulty), the 3 player game is perfection, and the 4 player game is very difficult.  Hand management is the differentiator: in a 2p game, it is easier for one player to find a "cure" by collecting five cards of the same color, only four cards if you have the "Researcher" role.  In a 4p game the cards are spread out, and players have to use turns trying to pass cards between each other instead of treating infected cities.  Minus one point for this lack of scalability.  Interestingly, [thing=40849]the expansion's[/thing] introduction of a "Legendary" difficulty provides a solution.

Cooperative games resonate with me, because they offer me a chance to teach a game, and also try to win at the same time.  [i]Pandemic[/i] has a theme which allows for a streamlined rule set which also provides a compelling challenge.  You can even [url=http://www.brettspielwelt.de/Spiele/Pandemie/]play it online for free[/url].  Don't be inoculated by all of the hype: [i]Pandemic[/i] really is a game you should try.

We're not really fans of co-op games.  I only really enjoy them if there's a forcing function that makes it materially different than a single player game (ex: traitor in BSG, hidden info in Hanabi, time constraints in Space Alert).  It seems good for what it is, just not our cup of tea.

I traded a good sized lot of MTG cards to my LFGS for this back in 2013.

First few games were two player with my wife. Neither of us got too excited for it. I was into other games with my active game group when I got it so it never reached the table there before we split up.

Jump a few years - We broke it out at a friends house and played through 3-4 games that night. The following months my wife and I started increasing the difficulty and determined we really enjoyed the game and needed expansions.

Hear good things about this game from the D6G podcast guys.
Update:  Just got the game.  Gorgeous production, sturdy box, simple to follow rules.  All components there unlike my last Z-Man game.  Can't wait for someone to come around to play.
Good family game.  Can't wait to play with 3-5

Tension ratchets up with three players.  Loads of fun and actually plays faster.

Yikes!  Four player is a bear.  Play with only three epidemic cards to survive past the second round.

My first foray into cooperative game and it is a very well done game indeed. I still think the outbreak mechanic is one the neatest mechanic I've encounter in board games. However, there's a high tendency to get burn-out with the game since you will definitely play it multiple times when you initially own the game just to defeat it. Once you defeat it, the game kind of lose its initial magic but still fun nonetheless. I'll only play it now with 3-4 players to pose a more difficult challenge instead of with 2 players.

Since I play mostly with my wife and two daughters, a cooperative game is ideal. To this day, we have yet to "master it" and we probably only win about 50% of the time. The expansion, On the Brink, only increases the replayability and variety. I haven't purchased any other expansions yet. The game design is truly a marvel at how well the AI works. I really enjoy the variety of roles available. Also, the different scenario challenges keeps this game from getting old. Not crazy about the time it takes to set everything up and prepare the decks. Also, it seems like some random setups are just not winnable. Finally, the ending can be anticlimatic as you can see that you're about to win or lose a turn or two prior.

More frustrating experience than fun. Love the interaction and the team effort, but can't escape the been-there-done-that atmosphere each time we play it. There's nothing you can do to turn the tide in your favor. You simply have to hope you can keep ahead of the cards and ride your team strategy to victory. Don't take my word for it, however. Have yet to beat this damn game. More telling is that it is difficult to convince people to play it again. Bummer. Had high hopes for this one.

Update: Finally beat this sucker! Okay, on intro level. Still, this game has grown on me, and will continue to play as much as my group allows.

A very nice looking game. A fun game to play with the family. It really does feel like a multi-person puzzle, as others have said, so you have to be ok with that. It plays quickly which is nice. One of the reasons we don't play Shadows Over Camelot as much as we'd like is because of the game length. Pandemic is easy to explain too, which is nice. I think this is a great game.

Excellent game.  I got Forbidden Dessert first and was unsure that I would like Co-Ops.  I was converted with that game and I like this just as much if not better.  I think that there is more of a challenge here and certainly more variability with expansions.

First two games, the "starter" and a regular with the wife only, we were in a little bit of trouble at various points in them both, but the outcome was not seriously in peril. I like the game the second play was to get more taste of the first, we've both read the rules and it was fairly quick and painless, looking forward to more players on this one.

It was a win for the wife at her first TN game days this year, and I think she wisely went with the crowds cheering, to bring home this game. looking forward to it and am glad to have it in the collection.

This is an incredibly overhyped game. You are researchers at the CDC trying to rid the world of 4 deadly diseases. I have the 2nd edition, which has great components and art, but I feel this game has to be played at the right time with the right people, or else it becomes not fun and everyone follows the leader as they play the game solo.

I feel the hype of this game doesn't live up to the actual feeling when you play.

Nice concept, great components, yet the players impact the experience more than they should.

One play, with four.  Dunno, the mechanics are interesting and the game was not-unfun, but it is really multiplayer solitaire in the truest sense of the word - everyone working to beat the game before it beats you.  Meh.  We won, but there was no overwhelming feeling of accomplishment, no "ooh, remember when" or "I was planning *this*, but... " moments.  It passed the time in an unboring way, but really not much more than that.

Rating after 6 2-player plays. Nice quick co-operative game, short enough for you to want to give it "one more try". Well designed, with good graphics. Keen to try it with 3 or 4 players to see if it becomes more or less difficult to win; you certainly can't waste a single move in the 6-Epidemic game.

Update Jan 2013: 12 plays and I'm done with this; it doesn't have the staying power of the Lord of the Rings co-op. Traded away.

One of my all-time favorite games. Excellent theme and wonderful mechanics (adding the previously infected cities to the top of the infection draw pile is genius) make for a good time.

My rating on this may go down to 6 once (if) I win it.  I've played four times so far, and we've lost each time (all normal difficulty).  I'm not sure if the replayability will last after I've won a game.  Update:  Have now won several times, but I still think this game deserves a 7 rating.  The card draw mechanic is truly novel, and does a good job at adding some strategy to a purly co-op game (which are, in my experience, largely influenced by luck).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The first time I played this game I thought is was the best co-op game ever. Now that I've played it half a dozen times with different groups of people, I realize that the game is really meant to be played solitaire. If you've got a group of mixed experience the vets will end up "advising" the newbies on the optimal move. The result is the newbies might as well not be playing at all. There has to be better rules on interplayer communication than exist to make this game work multiplayer.
And who wants to play alone anyway.

Ainoa yhteistyöpeli omassa listassa. Periaatteessa ihan jees, mutta onko sittenkään. Haastetta tuntuu olevan ainakin toistaiseksi, koska ei läpi ole mennyt. Silti, mitä sitte vaikka meniski läpi? Pidetäänkö bileet? En tiä, kyllä pelissä pitää olla vähä narskauttelua, juonittelua, feivoreita, stäbiä, jopa backstäbbiä, tai jotain kilpailua edes. Ei se muuten kauaa jaksa sytyttää. (17.3.2009)

This game is brutal. I'm not sure if we were horrendously unlucky, but we went 0 from 6 during our first Pandemic sessions, and that was on easy mode!!!!!

It's a great game of teamwork and should be a must have for any person who enjoys co-op games. The game is fast playing and gets very tense very quickly. As many people have pointed out, Pandemic suffers from the curse of the co-op: Where one player (generally the most experienced) takes control of the group and reduces the other players to spectators.

RATING: 8
Co-operative game where you and the other players try to save the world from four diseases ravaging it.  For bonus fun, name the diseases!  Scramble to find cures for Bronchial Marmosets, Bloatyhead, Splatterlung, or Zombieism!

When playing co-op, you sometimes wind up with a player the owner of my favorite games shop refers to as "The Colonel."  The Colonel knows the game better than anybody else (or at least thinks he does [and yeah, it's usually a "he"]) and does his level best to turn the game into a solitaire exercise where you're just along for the ride and there to bask in his glory.

Some co-op games have mechanisms that thwart The Colonel.  Pandemic, unfortunately, is very nearly The Colonel's ideal environment.

If you can avoid having that ass at your table -- and avoid the temptation to BE that ass -- this game will easily rate a 9 or 10.  Despite very simple mechanics, it's tense as hell.  Every decision means something, and the next card drawn could be victory or disaster.  It manages to be challenging without feeling unfair, and can make for a great experience.

But if you've got The Colonel at your table ... seriously.  Give him one warning that he needs to stop ramming unsolicited advice down everybody else's throats.  Then when he gets pissy with you for not doing exactly what he told you to do, get up and go play something else, and make a mental note to never play a co-op with this jagoff again.  (And fer Chrissake, don't actually BE that guy.)  Because, seriously.  Fuck The Colonel, man.  Fuck 'im.

Great co-operative game but really, really depends on your group as to what sort of experience you get. It leans heavily towards group decision making (overriding the individual) which means that less experienced/confident players can feel left out. In my opinion, just as fun with 2 as with more, as the game feels more collaborative with fewer players.

RATING: 7
[i]The[/i] gateway co-op, and a compelling puzzle of a game, tricky at normal difficulty and extremely tough at "heroic" level. Its mechanics are beautifully simple but quite thematic, and there's a certain morbid joy to be had in watching outbreaks cascade across the continents. However, it can be a bit dry, and without players of roughly equal ability and experience it can suffer from "quarterbacking" syndrome, where one person dictates everyone's moves for them.

Great game! The wife and I will take this out about once a week and play a few games. With two player, depending on your role card combo,this game can be very challenging (even perhaps impossible). I think we are still green at this game, and devising a flexible strategy that will work against a 5 epidemic card deck has been impossible but fun.

One of our favorite co-ops. It can be extremely difficult if you get some bad card draws but figuring out how to beat this game is just pure joy. My wife and I hammer the hell out of this one.

RATING: 8.3
Great theme for a coop game and particularly well integrated into the game. Tough decisions to be made throughout the game. Nice buildup to a climax as the game always seems to be close. There are no shortcuts or easy ways to win this one unless you get very lucky. Very easy to adapt for solo play and the short playing time is a bonus also. 

After a few more plays it seems that the challenges presented aren't the same for different player numbers. The difficulty remains the same but when playing with a lower number of players the problem is managing the outbreaks where with more players the problems seems to be to discover the cures. Interesting design!

The one thing I didn't like was that you don't have an option to do your own thing. This is a very tense co-op game, but you must make decisions by consensus to win. In other co-op games, like Shadows over Camelot, you can sometimes "go rogue" and do something that you want to do that the whole team doesn't think is a good idea and you can still win, but generally, in Pandemic, you all agree on a course of action and then have to follow suit. Still fun, I just didn't like that dynamic.

I will readily admit that I am very partial to cooperative games.  I love the idea of working together as a team to defeat the game.  And this is the most streamlined cooperative game I have ever seen.  Many groups will argue that it is not enjoyable because one person can control the game and tell others what to do.  While this is possible, our group just doesn't work that way.

For me it's almost like a brainstorming session.  People look at their cards and they throw out ideas for what they could do.  The key to the game is allowing all the players to contribute and make their own final decisions.  I love the ebb-and-flow of the diseases in this game.  The way that the disease can be under control and then one epidemic later things are a nightmare again.  We have a fairly good success rate with 5 epidemics, but we usually win with only 1 turn left in the game.

Pandemic is an ok/ good game but more you play it and more demanding you are as a gamer, the sooner you see the game's problems.

One of them being replayability and repetitevness. Yes cards get reshuffled, yes diseases come out elesewhere but it becomes repeating the same process over and over again, not to mention the problem of an alpha gamer or gamers who will in the end possibly be controlling all players to do what they say. To me that is not exactly spectacular. 

Yes it is a solid game, yes objectively speaking maybe even a good game, but I also think objectively speaking it ends there... it is not more than that.

This is best played with people you know. It can turn very quickly into a non-cooperative game with some people. I played with a group of mostly strangers and all other players were demanding that each player do exactly as they say. It was horrible. Many different opinions all shouted at once. Part of why I do not like co-op games. Now, a group I know and enjoy gaming with, this could be ok. Not that I found the whole concept and play all that exciting.

The downfall of this cooperative game is that it has strong potential to end up in "quarterbacking" where one player relays orders to the other players in order to achieve the objective. It doesn't feel cooperative at all whenever any player is more experienced than the others. If you need a cooperative game in your collection, look elsewhere.

I really, really like this game, especially with the OTB expansion.  That's a bit funny to me, because Mike P hates this game and we're both scientists.  I can see us playing this as a family as the kids get a little bit older (this is way over the head of my youngest).  Sadly, my gaming group (that I rarely make it to these days) has all but played this one out, so my only option is to play with family.

Excellent for newcomers and gaming veterans alike. I've been working to control my personal quarterbacking issues, so that's helped. It's also reduced at a player count of 2, since it's more one-on-one conversation about what's best than outright directing a group.

I love the tension, and how generally I end up one turn away from utter defeat (or more often from victory...) Fantastic balance for something that has strong randomness.

A wonderful cooperative game that scales really well from 2 to 4 players... though the game does change depending on the number of players (it is a bit more dynamic and challenging with 3 or 4 players).  Those I've introduced to this game like it.  It's easy to pick up and play quickly and it's cooperative.

After 30 plays, I'm finding that we usually win now with 2 or 3 players against the normal game and wins against the heroic game are pretty common with 2 players.  We have definitely improved!  And, I lose at least half the time with 4 players against the normal game.

With more than 50 plays, I still really enjoy this game! I'm now over 100 plays.

This is a good co-op, definitely blew me away when I first discovered it. But every game feels the same, and it has been replaced by Dead Men Tell No Tales for me.

Pandemic is a solid cooperative game in which players attempt to save the world by discovering cures for each for four diseases.  Each player plays a unique character with a few special abilities.  Disease cubes are added by a card draw based mechanic.  The theme works well with non-gamer types although the fun of the game depends on how well the group cooperates to beat the game.

Possibly my favourite game in my collection. I just love this game from start to finish. The simple game mechanics are easy to follow which makes this a good family game and being a co-op game it really is a game to bring people together. The game has enough strategy to make things interesting without bogging it down and becoming too complex.

RATING: 7
Nice design of the board and mechanics. Creates a feeling of urgency and you always have to make tough choices as you cannot cure everyone. Smart way to change difficulty by putting more outbreak cards in the deck. 
The bad thing is that there is no mechanism in the game to prevent one player becoming to dominant and making all the decisions, making the game boring for the less involved players.

A very good and simple co-op game. More accessible and less fiddly then Lord of the Rings. Everyone has different powers and each must be used well and in conjunction with the other players. Very elegant rule set. Z-man has really put together a cool co-op experience and it can be played in 45 minutes.It can definitely suffer from the one-person-runs-the-game problem. I suggest playing with closed hands (resist showing your cards to each other).

The basic story for the game is that you are scientists working for the CDC trying to cure four deadly diseases sweeping across the world. Failure results in global eradication of human population... so try not to fail.

At it's base it's a cooperative strategy game which plays out more as group puzzle solving. If you don't play well with others then you are going to want to keep moving. 

In Pandemic each player takes their own turn, what they do is ultimately their decision, but the nice part is that anyone can talk about what actions should be taken during each turn. It makes every turn a group discussion which adds a little length to the game but makes it a team effort. If you have a team working well you can knock out a game in about 45 minutes, but on the flip side it can take a full hour and a half if things aren't going smoothly within the group.

This game is difficult, no sugar coating, but it just makes the actual victories that much sweeter. The game does scale to player skill level so less experienced players can play an intro game and people well versed can play at settings that give the same feeling as the waiting room at your proctologist.

A downsides to the game is that it can lead to someone taking over as table captain. Occasionally someone will feel, for one reason or another, that they are the smartest and therefore their suggestions should be exactly what the entire group should do. My response to this is that the meek should speak up! Just about every school I've been to the teacher always said "There is no such thing as a stupid question" and in Pandemic that is absolutely applicable. Your idea might not be the greatest for the situation, but part of your idea might be useful. I've had many games where I thought A+B=C, then someone suggests A+D=F, to which we then come up with D+B=W... W for winning! Bottom line is you should voice your opinions. If you are a quiet talker then use your legs to kick people until you are heard out. 

Personally I love co-op games. I really enjoy seeing how other people are working on the same puzzle as opposed to how I am working it out. Pandemic scratches that itch to the point my leg involuntarily shakes.

If you're reading this, you've likely played pandemic already. My opinion is similar to how i now feel about settlers; it's decent at most everything, and while I prefer to have expansions or better yet, the dice based alternative, it's still a good game that sees plenty of new material to this day, especially with pandemic legacy. 

Vanilla pandemic deserves its due but i'll never be asking to play it.

Good - sometimes hard to beat, simply based on where the epidemic cards wound up in the deck. We had one game totally under control and then lost it at the end with absolutely no chance of recovery because of the way the epidemic cards were close together. That feeling of helplessness causes me to deduct a few points. It is fully cooperative, though, which makes it the right game for a certain type of crowd.

The classic modern cooperative game. There is a bit too much of unpredictable chance involved. I don't like how often one player becomes the "coordinator" and everyone else just follows his "orders" like with most cooperative games. It gets more about the communication than the actual game.

As it often happens with cooperative games, when playing Pandemic those who know how the game works aim to tell those who don’t what they have to do, thus reducing the latters’ playing to just a handful of soulless and unsatisfying turns whose only end is to maximize their moves: this way though the newcomers feel useless all the time, do almost nothing and understand even less, thus failing to enjoy the game.
As far as cooperatives go, there are many better games than Pandemic, whose theme though is undoubtedly its weakest point as well.

 The more I thought about it, the less I liked this game.  It's a co-op game, but I don't like as much as I like LotR.  I think it has to do with the theme.  It's not nearly as engaging as LotR so it seemed more abstract and I didn't get the feeling of eradicating disease.  I felt it was more to solve the puzzle, there is no story.  Traded this game off while I still could.

Frantic and engaging coop with simple and elegant rules. Win or lose hinges somewhat on luck of the draw re when epidemics occur: a very early one can cripple you, as can two in quick succession.

Home run.  This game is fabulously fun even if our group has played it to death.  A fast moving game that nails all the 3 important attributes of a good coop game: increasing tension, encouraging cooperation and variability.

The method of accruing disease blocks is inspired, ramping up the urgency as the game continues on while having a great mix of randomness and hysteresis.  The nature of curing diseases and the player powers forces player to work together.  Variability is handled well with the randomness of the disease outbreaks.  While much of a game is block triage, this doesn't actually get old, mostly because Pandemic is quite short.  It's amazing how many sins are avoided by merely making sure a game ends in a timely manner.

If we want a meaty coop game we go for LotR, otherwise it's Pandemic all the way.

This is a fun exciting coop game which can be learned in 15 minutes but take 100's of games to master.  The multiple levels of play (4,5,6,7 Epidemic cards) which are added to the deck allow for a wide range of skill sets to play.

Enjoying this so far. Held off because I don't like medical stuff, and it seemed that the theme might be a bit boring. It's similar to Forbidden Island (no idea which came first) but with a lot more going on. At first, it seems like it's pretty easy to keep all the diseases under control, but if you start to get outbreaks, watch out! 

One thing about this game: I am almost rooting to lose, or at least have it be a nail-biter. Winning is cool, but it's better if you win right before you are about to die.

Fun cooperative game of eradicating diseases from the Earth before time runs out. The system is heavily (but not unfairly) weighted against the players. Experienced players will need to plan their moves carefully to mitigate misfortune from Epidemic outbreaks. I think this a good game to show new players what sort of games boardgame hobbyists enjoy.

I have a gripe with Pandemic, which I think can be said about other co-ops as well (not that I've played that many):

When you keep your hand of cards secret, it feels like such a redundant thing to do, because everyone is working together towards the same goal.. why keep the fact that you have any given card in your hand a secret if someone else needs it, or needs you to use it? 

That said, play with everyone showing their hands and it can feel like all but one player are redundant, as the game can be (and often is) played solo.

Give me a co-op with a traitor or secret objective - then there's a reason to hide your cards and it doesn't feel so labored.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy playing Pandemic and I understand that further expansions introduce some of the above mentioned twists, but for me the base game is just not a heavy hitter.

It was fun at first, but I grew bored of it. A pretty core design that could've been refined into a great game. As it is, it's too light, and ends up making it too easy for one player to boss everybody. Some decks are impossible to beat, while some are too easy. Meh.

I really like this game so far.  The concept behind it gives a good background for the game and the mechanics are pretty elegant.  I am finding it a challenge to win.  I think I have the game down for 2 players but am finding it very tough with 4 players.  I love the luck factor as it give a high replayability factor which I like in games and it is a game after all.  I really don't like games that once you have the system down you can't lose.  I am looking forward to buying the expansion some time in the near future.  I would recommend a buy on this one or at least a play first.  You probably won't be disappointed.

I absolutely love the cooperative aspect of this game with lots of talking with friends over what to do next. Every game is completely different and the game is always right down to the wire. My wife finds this just OK but she historically doesn't care for cooperative games. Everyone else has fallen in love with it immediately.

We now play this game with 3 or more people and my wife agrees that it's much, MUCH better than with just 2 people. We've now played 8 or 9 games in the last two weeks and finally have our first win with that group. We now always look forward to future plays.

Hmmm... I don't see the pull of this game.  The unusual card mechanic is nice, but the whole game feels like a stripped down co-operative game without much pop.  I prefer to play FFG's Arkham Horror where you have some character development and more decisions.  In Pandemic, the theme feels pasted-on, and the gameplay feels forced (i.e. having to go to the city named on the card in order to pass it to another player).

RATING: 8.2
Best with 4, but almost as playable with 2 or solo , this co-op game took BGG by storm and rightly so. The mechanics behind the game increase tension as time goes on. There's a card limit - if they run out, you lose. There's an infection cube limit - if you can't place a cube when required, you lose. There's an outbreak limit - too many outbreaks and you lose. There are also epidemic cards which not only cause an instant batch of cubes to hit the board in a new city, but also force all the places already infected to get put back on top of the infection pile, so they'll all be coming at you again from then on. These mechanisms link and compound each other too. The option to vary the difficulty by amending the number of epidemic cards in the deck is clever also. 

My first solo game (with 4 epidemic cards - the easiest setting) saw my 2 players win by curing the 4th disease with 1 black cube left unplayed, 1 outbreak remaining until I lost and only 3 cards left in the draw pile. Pretty close on all counts and quite dramatic at the end!

There was a buzz about this game everywhere and even the people who usually announce "I never play co-op, I'm too competitive" wanted a go at this one.

I've found this to be an immensely enjoyable game, there's plenty of theme here, it just drags you in.

This is an excellent cooperative game.  The different types of cards (roles, events, player deck, infection deck) provide a lot of randomization.  It is something different every time I play it.

RATING: 8
There are some very clever mechanics here which inspire panic and dread as well as any you'll find. There is a real sense of accomplishment when you can solve the puzzle - which had no guarantee of a solution at any time. The theme makes perfect sense with the mechanics though it can make for a bit of a "downer" when another loss occurs. I'm probably in the minority, but however silly it is, it's just more fun to conceive of diabolical, Lovecraftian doom than real doom being visited upon the world population. This is a classic game for a reason and it deserves to be tried by everyone, but I might find myself playing the considerably lighter Forbidden Island when I want to play with the same mechanics.

Update: I've raised this to a 7 after getting some experience with the iPad app. It really is very clean and sometimes I want that. I still feel it's probably best as a solo game because the alpha gamer factor is very high here (a factor addressed well in more recent co-op games)...maybe expansions will mitigate that somewhat in this title; I will have to see.

Update: Yep - an 8 now. A modern classic. Playing Pandemic Legacy (a stone cold 10) helped me see more theme in the original game in addition to its cleanness and elegance. The alpha-gaming issue is still there, but that issue isn't enough to have it less than an 8.

Nicely designed co-op game that can provide some tense moments and agonizing decisions. Gets a lot of "one player tells all the other ones" comments, but I don't mind because ragging on the one guy who was so sure where to tell everyone to go and then loses is fun. The infection/epidemic/reshuffling mechanic is brilliant. One of a handful of games I've played that when we lose, someone says, "We're playing again, we almost had it the last time!" Played solo, two, three and four players, played great every time.

RATING: 6
Do not expect a cake walk with this one. With only one victory in 3 plays (and that was with the "Easy" setting of only 4 epidemics), this game challenges you and up to 3 friends to save the world from an assortment of nasty viruses.

Communication and teamwork are the most important things to use (that and the medic role) if you want to get anywhere near taking care of the virus outbreaks around the world.

Excellent value in cooperative gaming.

My wife likes the sound of a cooperative game based around diseases.  "It sounds interesting" translates to a game I want to play with her, and something I want!

We picked this up and have run through it together.  So far, so good, looks like a game we'll enjoy playing together!

This is a very light game, but it can be difficult to win at first.  Took us five games to win, though the fourth game was very close.  It's a good game, but it doesn't scratch my gaming itch quite enough to make it a main event game.  Good filler and something fun to play with my wife when we don't have a lot of time.

The lack of theme with this game bothers us.  I find we end up playing Stone Age or Carcassonne over this title, and I can foresee playing a few other games before this hits the table.

Played some solo games of this, and it was more engaging than I'd thought before.  I don't know that I'll play it all the time or over certain other games, but it made for a quite enjoyable solo experience.  Increasing my score.

Traded away for a gift certificate.  It was not going to get more play, so I might as well turn it into something I enjoy.

3 plays:

Having played similar co-op games (Forbidden Island and Desert also by Matt Leacock, Flash Point Fire Rescue) that race against time and cascading crisis, I both appreciate how well Pandemic sets up crisis, and I miss the rich detail and character of the other games.

Pandemic just feels very dry. The turns sort of blend together. It's good, but even though Forbidden Island is much simpler, at my house we pull it off the shelf much more often.

This is such a great game.  I think it is great for all ages at is touches on learning locations of major cities around the world and doesn't have the cut throat feel of non coop games.  This is one that is constantly requested on my board game nights.

Normally I'm not crazy about co-op games, but this game is great. It's easy to understand but challenging to play, well-crafted (lots of "ooooh" moments as you realize how well it's structured), tense and pretty exciting.  Thanks Coco for the gift!

Gets a bit more stale with each subsequent play.  Needs On the Brink to keep it interesting.  Although it is a cooperative game, I hate when someone suggests a move for someone else and basically ends up taking over for a weaker player...but if you don't suggest moves it feels less and less cooperative.  The game can also be entirely random at times when the worst possible cities come up and a game ends before the team even has a chance.  We have had the game end on a first round before.

RATING: 7
Quite possibly my favorite of the "group puzzle solving" genre.  The Outbreak mechanic is one of the most elegant design solutions I've seen in quite some time, and creates a very interesting dynamic.  It manages to create just the right level of panic and challenge.

As always, the wrong group can ruin this one, though.  As long as everyone has good contributions to the table, it's an amazing game, but it could easily degrade into "one smart guy and his puppets."  So long as you can avoid that pitfall, it excels.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game is a beautifully designed, inexpensive, cooperative game; perhaps still the best in its genre. Below is my argument for this NOT being a gateway game.  

1. The Alpha Player Dominance Conundrum. As an alpha player, there is a lot of flak for trying to control the game. However, new players are so overwhelmed that they end up asking for help anyway. So who's really at fault? 

2. Choice vs Randomness. While this game provides a sufficient amount of actions, there isn't really any room for choice given the level of randomness. You're never going to avoid an outbreak, only to leave and watch an outbreak happen at the city that you just left. Oh wait, yeah you will. 

3. The Percentage of Losing. After 45 minutes and losing, I can't get people excited about this game again. (Usually, "What would we have done differently?" See #2)

4. The Underwhelming Abstract Experience of Winning. Whether you win or lose, the board will still be covered with cubes. Compare it to Forbidden Island in which you escape via helicopter; in Pandemic, you just sort of walk away.

Took me four times to finally beat the game on the easiest level.  After that I have beat it almost every time on easy.  MUCH better with 4 or 5 people than with 2 (where one player takes control to easily).  I can't wait to try normal difficulty.  Our friends LOVE this game.

From the first play realised how good a game this is, I had never played a co-op before and was not sure how our play group would get on with this.

The play is engaging, it really draws everyone in and both shared victory and defeat are enjoyed 'we were sooo close!'

The difficulty is tunable and tight and the re-playability high, I have never had our group say no to a game of Pandemic.

Great for playing with the kids. It's a true co-op, with the strengths and weaknesses this type of game brings. If you have one dominant player then they might as well be playing solo and everyone else just watches while they make all the decisions.

I`m not the greatest Co-op Fan. But this one is really good. 
The tension / time pressure is high. So everybody must try to optimize his Experts abilites for the Rescue-Team. In this game it is tough (but not impossible) to win. It depends for sure on your team game play, but also from the card draw and Roles (Characters) involved. So the replayabilty is given here. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is indeed a very enjoyable co-op game.  Not to mention it is very solid as a solitaire game.  It is, as advertised on BGG, very difficult to win.  However, it can be done so it doesn't get to the point where it's frustrating.  I have only played a small hand full of times so far, so my current rating may fluctuate some after a few more plays.

I do need to mention the components.  Either the board is too small, or the pieces are too big..maybe a little of both.  Either way, the board can get awfully cluttered when an area gets busy.  Often times you will not even be able to see the names of the cities underneath all the cubes, pawns, and research stations.  This forces you to move things around on the board and it is very easy to get cubes of the same color pushed around, thus making it easy to possibly end up with a cube on a city it shouldn't be on.  I suppose after many plays you will memorize the city locations, but at least initially it is quite annoying.

First impression after a few games: I like it. It´s simple, fast and interresting.
Be warned: This game is really cooperative and there is no hidden information, so one player can dominate the game by telling everybody what to do. If can avoid that this seems to be a very fine game.
Edit:More games played (>10) and still impressed. Only drawback I see up to now: The game get´s a lot easier with two players thn with 4. Some balancing for player number in the expansion would be great.

What I can say about it: it is hard to understand, takes a long time and makes you think twice until making a move. So, let me explain a little more about this game. Usually, if you want to play pandemic for the first time, play with 4 epidemics and if possible, with a person that already played the game at least once. To be sure that you have a chance for the first time, you can take also your characters because in 2, it's even harder, not necessary in 4. Don't forget about the 7 cards in the hand, it's very important. Look at the game and search for cities that have already 3 cubes on them, you don't want explosions or other infections. Look at the infection deck, remember what cities were infected earlier, what have 2-3 cubes on the table, etc. Read the small rule card that every player has in case you forgot something (usually for transport). It usually takes more then 1h - in case is you play for the first time. Try to find cures, don't eradicate them if you don't have time or cards. I think it's the best game that i have played ever on this idea of cooperative playing. For sure i will take an expansion on it :).

A simple yet fun co-op game.  Players each have various roles that gives them various powers to fight outbreak and spreading contagion spreading around the world.  

This game is fun, but for me lacks some of the grittiness I would like to have in the games I play.  In the same sense I see how it can bridge a gap into cooperative games for newer gamers or younger gamers.

RATING: 6
This is an odd game where no matter how many people are playing, there really only feels like there is 1 player. Everyone is on the same team and trying to achieve the same goal. If you have a gamer who like to hold everyones hand all the time, it might come across as boring and it could feel like your watching them play the game by themselves. 

I only play this game because its a great party game and other people love it. It's another one of those games for people who are unsure about board games but know they don't want to play monopoly for the 1 millionth time.

I turned sour on this game quickly.  At first, it was interesting.  Then after a few more plays, I realized it's not so much a game as it is a puzzle being solved by a group.  Like a group crossword puzzle, with everyone else coming up with answers before you.

Elegant game with a cool theme that fits.  But even with a group it felt like I was always playing this solitaire.  One brain seems like it has to take over and coordinate all the players actions for you to have a chance at success.  Too puzzle-y, which is a problem I have with a lot of co-ops.  And while the theme is cool at first, and it does feel like you're fighting a virus, somehow after a few plays the theme disappears and just becomes an abstract puzzle.  With all that said, I would like to try this with the expansions and maybe different groups of people.

A great game. The mechanics are very well-designed. There is just something beautiful about watching the way the viruses spread throughout the world when there is an outbreak.

Pandemic was my first co-op game experience, and it is still one of my favorite all-time games. While it's notoriously difficult to win (I've only won about 1/3 of the games I've played), it's not impossible. Although it's a lot of fun, though, Pandemic is not without its flaws. The two big caveats I would give it are:

- Winning is actually not that much fun. The times I've had the most fun with Pandemic are when my group loses and we instantly want to play another round. This never happens when we win.
- If you're playing with people who are *too* focused on winning and not as focused on letting people make difficult decisions, it can turn into a situation where one player is just telling everyone else what to do, which can be pretty annoying.

Regardless, Pandemic is one of those games I'm ALWAYS down to play, which is saying something. It's easy to teach to new people, but the randomness of events makes it incredibly replayable.

Excellent cooperative game, which I would consider an 'Essential' for any gaming enthusiast. Pandemic presents an interesting puzzle to be solved every game. Replayability is decent...we have logged 25 plays, and difficulty is easily adjusted. Luck can be a big factor...one game ended (in a loss) after the second player's first turn. We laughed and reset. We still pull this out on occasion.

Nice enough full cooperative game: reasonably easy to explain, good cooperative theme, pretty to look at, quick. I think cooperative games without traitors or high randomness (Red November) just don't appeal to me as much.

Pandemic is an excellent game that is worthy of shelf space for several reasons:
1) It's very different from the usual Euro.  Co-op play is such a different dynamic.  It is not one that I want all the time, but it offers a nice change of pace, and is also highly suitable for gaming with "non-gamers".
2) The theme is really, really well done.  And it's not set in Renaissance Europe.  Again, a nice change of pace.
3) Plays well with 2, and is, again, a great change from games in which you or your spouse have been a little bit dominant in recent times, leading to a blacklisting of said game.  Hypothetically speaking.
4) The game mechanics that you are playing against offer scaleable difficulty, and give a real challenge.  I think it's probably very difficult to design a game which will give a satisfying challenge to players of all skill levels, but Pandemic accomplishes this admirably.

Bottom line: It's Co-op.  This is good, and bad, but mainly, it's very different.  Pandemic is a really, really well done Co-op game.  If you never want to play cooperatively, this is not for you.  But, for most of us, Pandemic is a great option in many situations, and provides a welcome change of pace.

Expect games to go 30-45 minutes, with time decreasing with experience (and also when you get a brutal draw, and lose in the first three turns).  Replayability is very good.  Suitability for 2 players is high. 

Update: after 10 plays, I've upgraded my rating from 8 to 9: Always want to play.  This comes with something of an asterisk - I think there are many games I would pick over this, if it was just up to me, because I like competition more than co-op, and I prefer deeper games.  But, there are many situations where Pandemic is just the best game for the situation, because of the other players.  And, so far, this one has not worn out it's welcome.  So it's fair to say that, in those situations that call for a gateway game, or a co-op game, or a lighter game, I will always want to play Pandemic.

Great production value. Awesome mechanics and game balance. A lot of difficult decisions and strategizing. 

My one big complaint with this game is that it generally comes down to an "Alpha Player" playing the game and making all of the decisions. There is not a lot of cooperation here. It is essentially a solo game designed for 1 player and 3 observers. This one caveat makes it a bore.

It's a solo game. The puzzle's not nearly involved enough to require other people to solve it. Which lends to quarterbacking. Much prefer modern designs like Gloomhaven, which apart from being more involved, also give players agency to make their own decisions.

[b]Co-op on a map:[/b] This was the first modern boardgame I bought. Discovering co-op play was pretty rad, and for a while CD and I would always play at least two games in a row. This was also the first game we played with "action points," and I like the mini-puzzle that each turn becomes while you try to optimize your moves. The shuffling and replacement of the discard pile to intensify the infections is brilliant.

RATING: 6
A moderately fun co-op. Since I just adore cooperative games in general, I have to give thanks to Pandemic for doing so much to popularize the genre.

I personally don't find the medical theme super interesting, but it does come across pretty well. I really like the world map, which looks great and gives the game a surprisingly epic feel. Another nice thing is that the game is pretty short--four people can easily get it done in under an hour. Setup is a little awkward with the need to seed the Epidemic cards into the draw deck, but still pretty fast.

On the minus side, I don't find the actual gameplay to be super interesting. There is some strategy but the luck of the draw unquestionably predominates. And really, I just don't find the game's mechanic for finding cures (collect a bunch of cards of the same color, then discard them at a research station) all that compelling.

However, Pandemic's simplicity, brevity, and strong theme may make it a good choice for introducing people to the world of co-op gaming (particularly someone interested in medicine or public health). I myself would rather just play Eldritch Horror (a game that obviously owes much to Pandemic, but is much more interesting).

I should note that Pandemic Legacy, by all accounts, fixes my complaints about Pandemic's uninspired gameplay. I hope to try it someday.

My second favorite co-op game.  This game is great for non-gamers.  It makes them feel like they are doing a lot in the game.  If you have a group of equally experienced players, then this game is fantastic.  If there is one experienced player, make sure he doesn't act as the leader of the group.

Fun, fun game. Strategy is required, but definitely accessible to non-gamers. Have played it 2 player with my 5 1/2 year old son (using 4 roles and open hands), and he thinks it is his favorite game now. Played it 3 player with my son and my 8 year old daughter, and it was great too. Also very much enjoyed a solitaire game playing 3 roles. This will definitely be one of the most played games for the next few months. I originally rated this a 9.5, but I can't figure out why I took off half a point.

First Edition: One of my favorite Euros.... The elegance of the mechanics is impressive. However, this game achieves what not too many Euros do: it gives you more than a great mechanic, but also a strong connection to the theme. You really feel the preassure and the intensity with each card. On the Brink is a fantastic expansion.

My wife and I have only played this game about half a dozen times, but we find it very enjoyable so far. Still having quite a hard time winning, but still a great game. 

I will update this further when I have a chance to play with others and get more plays under my belt.

Edit: turned out I was playing with the incorrect rules. I can not say enough good things about this game. After playing countless games pandemic is quickly moving to the top of my favorites. I love the coop nature of the game and the theme. My next purchase will be the on the brink expansion for sure.

RATING: 5.5
I had to think long about why this game never took off for me. It's one of friend's favourite games, yet I've never had the impulse to learn the rules (as easy as they are) and I can't enjoy it. This game gave me incentive to learn about why I like certain games, and why I just can't be interested in others. The game is not bad by any means, but it tends to turn my brain off when it gets to the table.

All of the following reasons could be lacking in any game I enjoy, but Pandemic hits a critical mass:

The world and atmosphere: Jerry Seinfeld once said about sitcoms, that people will enjoy watching a show if they want to be there. When I see the Pandemic map and I think about flying to Atlanta or Ho Chi Minh City, I lose interest. 
The decision-making then becomes mechanical, superficial, and homogenized. This may be biased, because I may overlook this in a game that has a theme I enjoy. And I can see how others find the depth and simplicity in a card driven game. 

Rules are streamlined and the game flows well with good tension.

The team doesn't seem to ever feel in control as diseases are constantly spreading across the globe, but this helps to maintain the excitement level in this nice coop game. Has a simple game system with a fun theme to make this a hit with most any type of gamer. The pressure is on for the players as outbreaks escalate the need to find cures quickly before the world is overwhelmed with disease. UPDATE: After 30 plays, reinstating the 8 rating for the excitement factor, even at the Normal Level of game play.

Easy to feel the tension in 30min!

An Easy game, but really hard to master!
That is what we called, Awesome!

Oh, How can I miss the elegant Board design, with all card piles on the board,including the draw pile and the discard pile! Not like the other game, the cards in Pandemic won't be mess everywhere! Very brilliant design! You can play it on a bed!

I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I personally think this is a great solo game to play on heroic playing with 4 roles. Very difficult to win. Which makes you want to play it again and again, if you strive for victory.

Pandemic easily ranks as one of the top theme games on the market.  It's mechanics allow for 3 levels of difficulty, that challenge novice & veteran players alike.

The flow of the game is highly structured; however, it's not very difficult to pick up on, if you happen to play your first few games with a veteran player (or else like me, it'll probably take you 2-3 games before you get into the flow enough to avoid mistakes).

The grand-daddy of the cooperative games.  This game is perfectly balanced between the game and players (especially at 4 players).  Most plays (and they have been numerous) come down to the wire.  Win or lose; the tension is always there.  It makes you feel like each decision you make matters.  Definitely susceptible to alpha gamers, like many other coops, so choose your play group wisely, and enjoy the team-building that working through the tough decisions brings.

A wonderful game. (I prefer Forbidden Island for the tension) though. It can end with no real fanfare. This new edition has cheaper components, which is a real shame.

RATING: 8
A great co-op. It's easy to be too confident when everything seems under control and then be caught by surprise when the deck runs out. It usually takes a few rounds with the same group until we're able to win, which is about the right difficulty, especially for casual gamers who often find harder co-ops frustrating. There are also rules to adjust the difficulty, which should be a great way to keep the game interesting for repeated plays.

An excellent cooperative strategy game. Has enough randomness to feel fresh each time yet I've only once felt I've lost because of RNG. Design is tight and does a lot with a little. On top of that it takes 45-60 minutes.
My only problem is that, since everyone's trying to do the same thing, it's very easy for the most experienced player to dominate the game.

*All Plays Recorded*

I've only played it twice and I see potential in it. Unfortunately I can also see the potential for the game to be controlled by the most dominant personality in this so-called cooperative game. If played with people who genuinely hear each other out and strategize together it could be great fun. I also had the impression, however, that I would not find the game as fun after 10 plays. As I play this game more it will definately move either up or down.

I'm a little surprised at how popular this one is.  Like small world, I just don't get it.

It seems to fall pretty flat to me.  The problem is there is little tension in the game and all of the other players really aren't necessary.  You could just as easily play this game solo with all of the pieces yourself, since there is little independent action-taking.

Like most co-ops this suffers from "bossiest player just orders everyone else around" syndrome.

No desire to play this often, but it's fine to bring out now and then.

I'm enjoying the game thus far (and, I must admit, it is one of my most-played games of the year), but I'm afraid it could become somewhat "samey" with additional plays.Still, a fun, thematic, and fast-paced co-op title.

Edit: I've now traded it away and haven't really missed it. It was fun but I burned out on it pretty quickly. That being said, I wouldn't run screaming if someone suggested it (and I'd far rather play Pandemic than Settlers), but it wouldn't be on any kind of short list.

because you mostly know where the diseases will spread, or will not, it becomes too easy to solve for me, and losing is never because I could've made a different move or done better but rather just inevitable due to the stack of the deck... having the different combinations of characters though does give it some interesting elements to me for solving the puzzle in different ways, still it's definitely more of a puzzle and less of a game for me and it can be a challenge when playing with others and the best move is obvious but they can't seem to figure that out, I prefer Castle Panic for this reason since you never know what monsters will be drawn next it can radically change the board so that what seemed like the obvious best choice turned out to be a big mistake making it easier not to try to argue over another player's move.

Un juego cooperativo muy interesante, a priori un juego solo con cubitos de plástico y un montón de cartas podría parecer que tiene la temática algo pegada pero en cuanto empiezas a jugar sientes como las epidemias se extienden en cuanto te descuidas un poco. Es el primer juego cooperativo al que he jugado y estoy encantado (además lo he jugado bastantes veces en modo solitario).

Es sencillo de explicar pero tienes que llevar muy bien la estrategia cuando juegas en MODO HEROICO (6 epidemias) y aún así es posible que el mundo muera a pesar de todo. Como pega, creo que algunos personajes son muy potentes (sobretodo el GENETISTA)

I just picked this up today(2/22) from my FLGS and I'm glad I ventured out to get it!  Initial rating based on solitaire play.  This game is very cool and very tense.  For me, tension is one of those high qualities in a game and this one works well, even if you're all alone! :)  I'm curious to see how it will play with others but, unlike other card games, this one does seem to work well solitaire.  My game ended with the red cubes exhausted and all I needed was one turn to get the scientist to Tokyo, do the cure with his four cards and boom, there was still a chance!  But alas, it was not meant to be! :cry:  Somehow, I think I'll be playing this one quite a bit over the weekend!Update:  I finally won! :D  However, it was on the intro. setting and I had only three cards left in the deck, the next one being the fourth epidemic! :gulp: :what:  After 14 plays, I am a dismal 3-11, :shake:  but that is part of the appeal of this game: the challenge of beating the system!

After many plays, though, I'm not so down on it.  The abstract nature of the theme lets the game play in just the right amount of time - longer would be too long.  It also is a good gateway, and we've had friends enjoy it even when it kicks our asses (the cooperative aspect helps its gateway nature).  My sole complaint these days is how damn tough it is - I like a challenge, but this is right up there with Arkham Horror!  We rarely won, and somehow losing in Pandemic is more depressing than losing to the Old Ones.

Pandemic is a tense, heady cooperative game, but also light in its presentation: You do four things, draw cards then infect the world. The game is aesthetically well presented and plays smoothly. It's a great cooperative game, and even pretty good solo. Shoutout to F2Z for the iOS implementation, which also is very high quality.

A nearly perfect game. Beautiful board and components, cleverly designed card play, and not easy to master (but not too hard either).

I love how the epidemic cards are evenly spaced throughout the deck (giving you a way to predict them roughly) and think the reshuffling and reincorporation of the already-infected cities is a brilliant touch. Plus, the cooperative element means that no one gets resentful toward the other players. Haven't worked up to six epidemics yet, but look forward to it.

The medic is a little too strong, IMHO, but otherwise a wonderful game. 

UPDATE: "On the Brink" makes it even better (and significantly harder!).

I bought this due to the amount of hype.  I found it to be way too easy to win.  There is not much depth and the strategy required is pretty obvious each turn. There is something missing with this game that I cant put my finger on.  Maybe its the lack of chrome, I don't know. Regardless, this title is too shallow for my taste.

===========
Good co-op game that doesn't break any new ground other than it plays to completion in 45 minutes, which is quite nice...and the epidemic triggering the recycle of all the previous infection spots is sweet too.  I don't think I've seen anything like that before. The different player powers help to foster an environment where each player is able to make some decisions on their own rather than one player dominating the team and telling everyone what to do (like often happens in the co-op Lord of the Rings).  I like it, but after about 10 plays I'm ready to trade it.

I never thought that I would enjoy a pure co-op game. But Pandemic pulled me in. As long as you let everyone play their game, this is fun. I have realized that winning is quite random, but the feel of control is good enough to make it enjoyable. Easy to teach.

Update: I only play this solo now.

Maybe I don't like coop games. Pandemic feels pretty dry to me, like a group of players trying to fit together a jigsaw puzzle. I keep trying to figure out why it's so beloved here, and failing. UPDATE: 6 -> 7. This game is pretty fun solo on BSW. I haven't won yet playing the right rules (6 losses!). It's still a dry, puzzle-like game, but at least now I do feel some tension figuring it out and hoping I draw the right cards.I

Very good.  The mechanisms work in an interesting way to present you with a real challenge - so much so that in our first game we were badly beaten.  But the game was still so appealing that we all wanted to play again immediately and this time we won - though not without teetering on the edge of disaster before doing so - which made victory all the sweeter.  Having the medic in play the second time seemed to make things easier, though we also worked together better. Looking forward to another go but finding it hard to envisage how you can win on anything other than the easy setting!  Further play makes the medic look essential and even easy look hard.  We seem a long way from heroic!  Further plays help, as experience helps you better exploit the benefits of co-operation - still not easy though.  

On the Brink is a nice addition - see comments there.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great co-op gateway game that is usually really tense until the end.
++ The use of the infection deck that reuse the cities' cards in which infection has already occured to propagate diseases in a thematically and mechanicaly sound manner that still include a bit of randomness (by shuffling the discard pile and putting it back on top of the deck).
++ The game user-chosen variable difficulty depending on the number of "Epidemic" cards uses (and can range from easy to nearly impossible).
++ Good replayability because of the randomness of the setup (both for the disease cubes placement but also the "Special cards" used for the game and the varibale players' roles.
++ Variable players' power (role) assigned randomly at each game.
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (base game and expansion, and you can use the OtB expansion insert to store everything in just one box).
++ The "On the Brink" expansion adds a lot of replayability and also challenge as the game difficulty can be enhanced greatly with more "Epidemic" cards, the "Virulent Strain" and the new Purple Virus.
++ There are expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- A bit long to set up at the beginning of the game.
-- Being a co-op game, it is prone to the Alpha Player Syndrome (where an experienced player can dictate other players everything to do to ensure a win).

Played this 5 times now, and whilst it is a good fun co-op we nailed the 'heroic game' at the first attempt, so I am a little concerned about replayability - UPDATE: okay we've lost the next two attempts so I'm somewhat happier. However it perhaps still lacks the apprehension of pvp games or semi co-ops like BSG. Anyway I've upped my score.

Hey! I can finally rate this game I've been playtesting on and off for a couple years. I really like Pandemic, it's the best cooperative game I've played since Lord of the Rings. The key is in the pacing; the game successfully ratchets up the tension as infections spread and outbreaks pop up all over the place, and the players fight a race against time to conquer the various diseases. The game is just a perfect length, about 45 minutes, and the endgame tension is just right - the game doesn't end before it's over. The different roles give the players significantly different prisms through which to look at the game, which is helpful in cleanly driving table-talk and discussion without phony artificial restrictions like Shadows over Camelot had. All in all, this is finally another good cooperative game that gamers can enjoy. It's not as deep as Lord of the Rings, but it's also simpler and shorter and should be accessible to a wide variety of players.

Gamers should probably bypass the "easy" game and go straight to the standard game.

If you'd like to tweak the difficulty a little bit without going straight to Heroic level (which can be pretty tough) try starting the infection rate marker on the second or third space.

I normally enjoy coop games well enough, but this one is really good stuff!  Lots of fun figuring out how each player's special actions can interact most efficiently, and a lot of good tension as the players race to control the spreading diseases.  There's tension galore, and the different combinations of special abilities that can be dealt from game to game are fun to figure out how to best utilize.  Theme also adds a lot to the fun, as it actually feels like you're travelling around and fighting the different diseases.  Woohoo!

my final evaluation is based on playing the game without On the Brink Expansion.  I enjoy Pandemic more as a solo game probably more than as a coop game where I feel the weight of other people's influence on my decision making.  Controlling four or 5 roles isn't that difficult and the game becomes a thematic puzzle as you struggle to control epidemics and cure them. Without On the Brink the game is still good, but with the added roles, events, virulent strain, and mutation, everything is intensified and the theme really expands.  And I love that the theme is particularly relevant these days.

A very good multiplayer co-op game probably second to only Betrayal IMO. I haven't played it with a ton of different people but the "one person takes over and tells everyone what to do" doesn't seem to happen very often.  I can see it happening if played with a group of non-gamers cuz they just trust you know best but amoungst gamers it seems to work well. The role cards play a key part in this IMO. It promotes everyone giving their input and asking the group if they agree its in the best interest of the group to do X. The mechanics of the game as well really give you the flavor of epidemic outbreak.  If an outbreak happened in a particular city. Its going to continue again and again. Haven't played it solo as of yet but with the different levels of difficulty.  I could easily see it being very fun.

I've played several times, and while I find the game interesting and enjoyable, I'm not blown away.  It's a game that I'm happy to have on the list for a gaming marathon, but if I've only got time for one game, this is sure to get overlooked.  It's a game I'll never feel bad for not having played in a while (even Rise of Empires tugs at me now and again).  

As far as cooperative play, Space Alert gives me so much more of everything this game promised (a challenging puzzle, a race-against-time, sharing of information but individual responsibilities). 

Not a bad game by any stretch, just not something I feel the need to play regularly.

This game suffers from a common issue that plagues many coop games - its only fun when you are on the edge of loosing. Any moves you propose are discussed/approved by the entire group, which makes all of the moves near perfect, but also make the game very dull. You not really in a control of your own character - the group is in control of all characters at once. After a while it becomes a situation when you can safely go out for a drink/smoke/pizza, and the group will keep managing your character to the best of its ability without any real need for your participation. And yeah you can play this game completely solo.

If you win, less people die. What a cruel and bizarre theme for a "game". That it is one of the most popular titles and available everywhere is a sad testimony to the state of modern society; how will people feel about owning this when the next massively fatal and contagious disease hits?

I have nothing against science or reality based games - for a title which is far less morbid there is Stop the Germs (PNP): https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142902/stop-germs and
Virus! https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180020/virus

There is also Healing Blade:

Pandemic is a perfect example of what unfettered capitalism and mob mentality inflicts on all of us - there are many ways to make a game about the same subject matter (I live not much more than walking distance from the CDC and count many epidemiologists there as close friends) morally and in a way that respects life - in the case of Pandemic, simply changing fatalities to number of infections would be a start. Infectious diseases do not exist outside the context of global politics and society and Pandemic's crass and banal approach to the inequalities of our world is simply repugnant. 

It's also a poor game as pointed out by many other reviewers. Barnes and Noble, how I loathe thee for popularizing such thoughtless "games".

Excellent game following more games and a purchase. I agree with some friends when they say this can turn into a bit of a solo game when playing. Works great and is a cracking challenge every time. Not tried Heroic just yet. 17 Plays.

RATING: 7.2
A great introduction to cooperative games. However, I never feel like I'm saving the world from disease; I feel like I'm solving a logic puzzle. And typically, telling all the other players what they need to do to solve it, too.

I prefer co-ops that delegate player decisions a little better. This one's got a big alpha-gamer issue.

What an excellent game that lives up to the hype and then some. Played twice with 4 players, on easy but still couldn't win.  Need to figure the best way to cure diseases as fast as possible.

Rated a 9, but could trend as low as 7 if I find the winning to be too random.  I want to know that there is more skill to the game than luck.  Until I get disheartened though I will LOVE this game.

Played 2 player with Heather and enjoying this game even more.  She is not as enamored with it, but I want this to be a game we pull out quite often.  9 is still appropriate (9/26/09)

I don't normally care for cooperative games but this one I like.

Shares the top spot with Settlers of Cataan as best family/non-gamer crossover game. Fast to teach, fast to play, good theme, and being cooperative makes it non-threatening. There is plenty of meat here for gamers but I'd probably still choose something else if I'm playing with my regular game group.

RATING: 6
Thus far the best cooperative game, since it entirely avoids the need for rules limiting information exchange between players.

Sure, this turns it into a simpler multiplayer-randomness-puzzle, but thus far I have always been annoyed by players exchanging information in cooperative games by bending the rules rather than being creative.

RATING: 10
Conceptually I love how I'm playing the role of someone trying to save the world from disease. It's massively heroic.

Gameplaywise, I really enjoy how my role alters my perception of what the best course of action is. Somehow the best plans, as far as I can tell, make use of my special abilities. If I'm not the only player at the table who sees things this way, the result is a variety of plans to choose from.

Between that and the players occupying different spaces on the board, the game manages to create a team game composed of individuals, as opposed to a solitaire game played by a group.

Game designwise I love how the Epidemics cause the used cards to go back on top of the pile. It's a simple mechanic that both showcases how epidemics tend to rise and fall in the same places over and over again in the real world, while also giving information to the players so that they can plan ahead.

The art is very realistic (I own the original Z-Man edition, not the recent Filosofia remake with Montréal instead of Toronto). It passes on the feel of the world I live in to me. Women,  men, people of colour, whites, all in the same workplace.

For me, this game is the gold standard. Great game, great theme, great presentation, heck, even the rules are well-written. It is my most played game and if I could I would rate this game an eleven.

Note, the latest version is the same game, but it is a huge step back for playability. The darker busier board with white lettering makes finding cities harder. The plastic cubes are smaller and harder to count on a full board, as well as being cheaply made so stack poorly. 

To top it off, the art is dull and uninspiring and looks more appropriate to fighting future crime than disease.

Chaos management, look-ahead co-op. Pandemic stresses me the hell out, and like many co-op games, it can get bogged-down in bossy-pants, lets-argue-for-fifteen-minutes-about what-is-the-best-plan-of-action-for-Kabul (or whatever) syndrome. Do I game with assholes or am I the asshole? (Note to self: analyze the possibility of my own assholeishness later, and less publicly).

The first co-op I truly, truly loved. The base game is a little easy unless you're playing on Hero (where luck is obviously the determining factor), but goddamn if this isn't a well-designed game.

First off, SAVING THE WORLD FROM DISEASE! is a fun theme that feels appropriately epic and heroic. Watching the board get overrun by disease and losing feels uniquely disappointing (I mean this as a positive).

Pandemic perfects the "randomized puzzle" style of co-ops for me. Sometimes I just want to try and solve a puzzle with my friends. Trying to figure out the best way to optimize your turns as a team is fun. There's heaps of tension, and the way Epidemics (specifically the Intensify step) works is just downright genius - allowing you to see how the game mitigates some luck and makes things even more scary in the process is just fantastic.

Some people hate on co-ops because they play with jerks who like to dictate everyone's turns for them. Pandemic is a game that certainly would allow you to do that, so if you play with jerks stay away. BUT even if you don't play with jerks... it is true that it is very, very difficult for someone new to the game/genre to play with an otherwise super experienced group. Even if your group allows everyone to vocalize their opinions, etc., it's hard for a newbie to contribute anything meaningful in a group of seasoned players and that can ruin the experience for them. For that reason, it's really best played with people of equal skill level.

Update: Upgraded this + OtB both for aesthetic purposes (I think we can all agree these blow the original out of the water under THAT criteria) but mostly to be compatible with In the Lab. Worth it!

Update: Years later, this is still my favorite co-op. Ghost Stories is pretty equally fun to base game Pandemic, but I have to give Pandemic the edge just on the basis of expansions - so far they've managed to release universally excellent expansions that only improve the base game.

So far so good.  The team truely feels like they are out for a common goal.  Game feels organic.  

Edit: As slick as the game design is, it seems like it becomes a game of listen to the biggest A type, or loudest, person in your group.  Probably not as bad as Im making it sound.  It feels more like a puzzle.  In the end, like with most co-op games, Im not sure why it needs more than one player.  For the record, I've never played solo.

Our family enjoyed the cooperative aspect of this game a lot.  We have a couple of very competitive people in the family, and while the tension during this game was present, it wasn't interpersonal in nature.  As others have mentioned here, Pandemic plays more like a group puzzle than a game.

This is a great example of a Euro-style co-operative game and still one of the best in existence, despite a subsequent plethora of lesser imitators (eg. Flash Point: Fire Rescue).  Combining action point allowance, variable player powers, set collection, and hand management with a tight, thematically-cohesive game "AI", Pandemic is nevertheless easy to teach to new gamers, thanks to the streamlined rules presentation in the rulebook.  The eye-catching graphic design and production (by Canadian talent, Josh Cappel) also add tremendously to the enjoyment of the game.  While some have expressed concern that experienced players can easily take over a group and direct the actions of other players, this criticism could apply to any co-operative game; if this occurs, it is an indication of problematic group dynamics rather than a failing of the game itself.  In summary, a highly-recommended game and one of the first that should be taught to any Euro gamer new to co-operative games.

[u]December 09:[/u] My first try with pure cooperative games with Laurène. Our first play was way too simple. Our next one was way more difficult. My last two games were a good challenge. For the moment I must say that my enjoyment is really varied for this game. I like it when there is difficulty but depending on the number of epidemics, it could be a very easy and thus boring game.

[u]March 2010:[/u] So, in a sense, Pandemic was a good buy as it convinced me to try a little more Co-op games. I later bought Ghost Stories and boy is ghost stories a lot funnier and challenging! In fact, I almost can't see myself playing Pandemic again. It feels a lot blander, easier. Yeah luck is more contained and this should be a big advantage in my book, but here, it just makes the game a bit too easy. It is nice to play but it doesn't really challenge us.

It's a nice co-op which does not have as much randomness as it's cousin Defenders of the Realm - and that's a big plus for me. Sure, there is randomness, but you always know if you can remove some cubes or not. I like the built-in timer (the deck running out) which seems to be the way I lose most times compared to outbreaks or no cubes in supply, but the expansion helps with making the game harder and hence I'm more likely to lose in various ways, which is great. The base game alone is good on it's own, but it really shines with the expansion which adds a lot to this fine co-op.

Pandemic is a cooperative board game where players take on the roles of various CDC workers attempting to stop four simultaneous disease oubreaks across the world.  It's a race against time to find cures for all four diseases.

Gameplay is a straight-forward set-collecting game with a few twists.  To find a cure to a disease players must collect (and discard) 5 cards of the same colour as the disease.  Players can trade cards with each other under limited circumstances, and have to abide by a seven-card limit.

Each player's role gives them unique abilities that need to be coordinated to ensure victory.

The base game is pretty good, but it's vastly improved with the On the Brink expansion.

Playing with open hands should really be the way to play, since in "Real Life" (which is the designer's reason for not playing with open hands) everyone has cell phones - especially hi-end scientists trying to eradicate a disease.  Open hand is the way to go.

If you've played and liked Forbidden Island, I recommend this game.  It's got a number of features that are very similar, but it has enough new things that make it more complex and fun without overdoing it.

I enjoyed this game much more than I did Forbidden Island, since more thought was required to be successful at it.  I also found that there was less of a single-person anchor, as it was hard for one person to see every outcome, which kept everyone more involved in the gameplay.

Played it once. 7,5 is a preliminary score. I missed the 'wow' effect in this first game - I expected a 'wow' effect after all the + reviews I read. Yet, a very good co-op game with a great theme. Forbidden Island is still much better!

RATING: 7.5
Neat game that is easy to pick up and teach. Our only gripe is over the restrictions on trading cards (only the card of the city you are both already in), which make the option of trading cards nearly useless. Ultimately it doesn't have a place on our game shelf because, as the wife puts it, this game is too depressing to keep playing. Mind you, I wouldn't turn down a game if suggested.. but I probably wouldn't suggest it and we've decided not to purchase. (Definitely glad we tried before buying.)

Rating based on two initial plays, so I'm sure it's bound to go down from there as I generally don't care for co-op games.  This one feels more fresh because of the role-interactions and the fore-knowledge of where the diseases where strike.  The deck can hose you, but not to the degree that a game like LotRings can because you have ways to contain the badness instead of just seeing what pops out of the bag.

RATING: 1
Played the boardgame once, was told what to do by the game owner. Typical boring alpha player co-op, and very dry, lacking theme, mechanics have no relation to theme or reality. "I'll give you this research data on Lagos but only if we both travel to Lagos first and are there at the same time." What? Is this game set in 1930?

Bought the app to give it a second chance, which allowed me to control four characters and play solitaire, quickly. Became obvious game is random garbage. First game, I lost on the second turn. Second game, I lost on the first turn, before two of my characters even got their first turn. Never seen a design so flawed before. A game where a player can lose before they even get to go?

The kind of game that makes you remember that other people's criteria for a good game can be quite different from your own. 

Would never play the physical game again.

Another great casual co-op game to play with everyone. The addition of On The Brink adds a fun 1 against many aspect, and In The Labs makes the entire discovering a cure concept much more fun. Doesn't hit the table often due to the lack of complexity, but a ton of fun.

I see it on parallel with Flash Point as the best co-op for people who don't play board games.

Awesome game for those who enjoy coop games. The rules are fairly simple, the difficulty is easily scalable, and the components and game board are attractive and elegant. Made much better through expansion. Like other coop games, "quarterbacking" is a key issue that I notice during Pandemic; one more strategic or experienced player directs everyone, and the creativity of all is stifled. I have inadvertently been that person before, and realized how crappy it is for all.

RATING: 7
[b] Logged plays split between base game and On the Brink expansion[/b]

Rated "8" after one solo play. Curious to see how this rating changes when playing with others. I lost first time through... this is harder than I expected! And, I found myself getting a little angry--in a good way. There's a pressure that develops to "beat the clock." As a true collaborative or solo game, it's more about puzzle solving than playing other players, but at the same time it's a pretty darn intriguing puzzle.

I like the challenge. But, if I keep losing and never win, I'll get angry--in a bad way!

Update: Yay! I finally beat it as a solo game. I can safely like this game now. The strategies are becoming more apparent. I'll be curious to see how many plays this game offers before it becomes a bit repetitive. That's certainly not the case yet.

Update after 25 plays: every play has been solo so far, and I still enjoy this. At some point, I might pick up the expansion to breathe more life into this, but this is much more mileage out of the game than I expected. If only every game held up for 25 plays!

Update: My 50th play, and it was the first time playing with other people. That's a bit tricky, as a pure cooperative game is hard to play if there is great disparity in people's familiarity with the game. I still had a good time, but 49 solo plays means that I have to restrain from bossing others around. Still, Pandemic is easily the only game I've enjoyed playing solo, and for that reason alone, I'm happy to own it.

Update: traded it away along with the expansion for Thebes. After 50 plays, I called it quits. This for me was a great solo game, but I never wanted to play it with a group because of the risk of the "bossing others" factor. It's still a solid game, and I certainly don't regret the purchase! If only every gamed yielded 50 quality plays. But now, I think it's time to "pay it forward."

A great co-op game. Plays well with two players and it even more challenging to play with more people. I think it could get repetitive if played to regularly, but it is a nice short game you can pull out and play. The rules are also easy enough to teach it is a nice introductory game for newer players. I think this will compete with Ticket to Ride for space on the table with family and friends.

One of the best loved cooperative games for good reason. It's a little different every time and usually provides a really good balance of challenge that can be increased or decreased a bit as the players choose. You may end up with a bit of a team leader the first play through, but players pick it up quickly and it soon becomes more collaborative.

I love the concept and theme of the game.  I also love how difficult it is and at the same time very simple.  The only thing that keeps me from bringing it out is how it brings out the alpha gamer in me.  It feels like you need to do it to win, and yet I feel so guilty pointing out what others need to do on their turn to them.

A very good game, flawed by the poor component quality indicative of Z-Man's Chinese imports.  Mis-sized cards are hard to shuffle, cubes come in a variety of sizes and shapes and boards warp and buckle.

I could care less about problems with the insert, but if riff shuffling in a card based game is difficult - you notice. I love the gameplay, but hate the components, enough so that I've avoided subsequent Z-Man releases.

It's my most favourite cooperative game. It might be wearing out on me after playing it several times with my friends on the table and online. 

The theme is great. I like saving the world and every character has a special role that could make a difference in the game. The tension and the suspense are what I love about this game. You know you're going to make it and win but your're also chasing after time when cities get infected.

This cooperative games asks to solve the evolving puzzle by managing risk and committing to a long term strategy early. The game is tough, there is nothing easy about it, but with experience you develop the tricks that will give you the edge. Unfortunately there is a lot of luck involved in this one, and if it doesn't go your way then it's all over red rover. The game scales well and can be played solo but can suffer from one overinvolved individual dictating the play. A must for your collection.

Pandemic was my re-introduction into board gaming. I loved the concept of working as a team to save the world from different diseases. I enjoy the co-op play,however the more I played the more difficult it got to play with beginners. An experienced player with beginning players will often end up tell each player what to do. This can take some of the fun out of working as a team to come up with solutions. If you are learning this game with others, it is a great time. If you are looking for a way to reinvigorate the challenge I would recommend picking up one of the many expansions.

Nice Co-op game with a nice, different theme.  The mechanics work very very well and the designers should be proud as they are not basic mechanics and they really put the theme and gameplay evidently.

Unfortunately, the game seems a bit redundant to me and sometimes, the game will simply let you no way to win (as in most coop games).  

Still a good game that serves as a gateway game for many of my non-gamer friends.

:sugar: :) :D :D :D The only co-op or semi-co-op game I've ever really enjoyed, unless you want to torture the definition of semi-co-op almost beyond recognition in order to include Republic of Rome, and quite possibly the greatest gateway game ever invented.  Pandemic is extremely lean in terms of rules and smartly designed to deliver a tough but not unfair challenge, plays quickly, and is almost as much fun as a rehash as it is play experience. More than any other type of game I know (with the possible exception of party games), co-ops require the right crowd to be fun, so one hallmark of a good co-op is that it's highly adaptable. Pandemic has this in spades -- it's easy enough to learn that you can teach it to people who aren't gamers by nature but are people you enjoy spending time with (my wife and parents were enchanted by it when I brought it home last Christmas), and it's hard enough to win that gamers won't scoff at it as child's play. I totally get skepticism as a default approach to co-ops, but this is one that should get a respectful look.

Thought I was really going to like this game. Fell flat and was kind of boring. Thought there would be more tension and more strategy. There is some strategy however one card can just ruin any planning. This might be a plus for some people, for me it felt like the game was playing us instead of the other way around. We were just reacting to the best of our ability and were subject to the fate of the card draws. The fact that it is pretty hard to win also is a deterrent.

I ordered this game based on a non-boardgaming friend who prefers cooperative games like this, versus competitive play.  He has played this game once and enjoyed it quite a bit.  He also has purchased Arkham Horror.  He enjoyed Descent.  I am thinking of picking up Last Night on Earth based on this.  It's always nice to have people interested in playing.

I have played other people's copies of this game and it is a fun cooperative game to play over the course of 1-2 hours.  The theme really does spark the imagination and keep players engaged.

RATING: 7
A co-op game that is easy to learn for non-gamers too, but which can easily be dominated by one player. This also means this game is very suitable for solo play, though.

The starting order of the cards (of both decks, though mainly the Infection deck) can make it impossible to win. With a bit of bad luck, this can even happen with Easy games, several times in a row. There are quite a few instances where there is no way the players could have prevented disaster.

UPDATE March 24th, 2014: score lowered from 7.4 to 7.
This game has definitely lost a lot of appeal to me, because of the afore-mentioned flaw of making it impossible to win. Not even the update solves this.

Although our most recent game was the easiest win ever... only two epidemics out by the time we won.        
Six epidemic cards is brutal.

New to this game (June 2017) and really enjoying myself. Variable player powers, sweet balance of strategy-pursuit with tactical readjustment in general, episodic ebb and flow of crisis-management and determined strategic pursuit all come together to make this a pleasure to play. Having fun with just the base game so taking my time with it. Looking forward to slowly adding expansions as well as getting into Iberia and Legacy.

I like this game but don't love it.  I feel like this game could be played with an alpha gamer controlling the entire game.  I would enjoy it more if there was a mechanism to control the ability to quarterback.  The board art, theme and components are awesome.

:star::star::star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar:; Pandemic is the quintessential cooperative game. Criticisms about "quarterbacking" are more about who you're playing with though than the game itself. If cooperative games were my jam this would be much higher.

Needs to be played with the right group. I realise this is a co-op game but I don't like having my turns mapped out COMPLETELY by other players.

UPDATE: I'm more than willing to play this again after learning to appreciate co-op games a lot more. I think the best way for people to play co-ops for the first time is to forget about winning and just allow new players to perform whatever action(s) they like.

A good cooperative game which is a great way to introduce people to the genre if they have not played it before.

My first co-op game and overall I like it...but it plays more like a riddle/problem solving exercise than a game.  This does not put me off.  But I have to be in the mood to get it to the table.  The concept and the way the virus's spread, etc. is very clever.  Really neat concept and excellently themed game.  It is easy to see why this is popular with gamers/non-gamers.  The game can be very tense and one wrong decision can mean worldwide catastrophe.

This was another game that we played in hospital (so it felt really thematic!) that helped kill a lot of time when we had to wait for doctors etc - the board is quite small so it was workable on the hospital food tables that they give you to eat your food.

This was an introduction to co-op gaming for my boyfriend and I and we love it. We have played this over and over in a single evening. 

This game is perfect for us because we are pretty much even when it comes to strategy etc so neither of us dominates the game. I think it would be much less enjoyable with someone who isn't great with regards to strategy etc but i guess it'd present another challenge!

Previously I rated this game an 8, but I have now given it a higher rating because of how much we like to play it. Many games you have to be in the right mood for, but pandemic fits most situations (if you have the right number of players). Everyone wants to play this when they come over and they talk about what a great game it is, and somehow we're not sick of playing it.

This game is great, though we did find that after a while we rarely lost - until we added the expansion. This is an awesome game.

RATING: 7
While I really enjoy this game and find it quite fun, the game is just too luck dependent for it to be a solid winner.  Two more games tonite (10-MAY-08) drove the point home.  Played three other games with this couple prior so they were familiar with the strategy and rules.  We went with 5 epidemics in each game.  The first game we won in about 5 rounds as the cards just kept coming up in our favor.  The second game we lost in that same amount of time due to too many outbreaks and ill-timed Epidemics.  Both games felt too hollow.  Rating dropping from a 9 to 7.

Pandemic is a fun coop game that suffers from low replayability. The first 3-4 games may be a challenge but once you get the subtilities of the game it can become very easy, even with the maximum amount of epidemics. We even made a tournament in our game store in wich different team competed to see who finishes the game first. However, the light ruleset makes it a very good familily / casual coop game.

To one more thing, the expensions add more level of difficulty to the game and makes it much better... and harder

I rate 6 for the basic game and 7.5 with the expensions.

I played once by myself to get the rules of the game but then went back to the TableTop episode for a second time to catch things I clearly missed.  After a second play-through by myself, I felt confident enough to bring the 10-year-old and 7-year-old to the table.

We played a round that we didn't get to complete before bedtime and they seemed to enjoy it, though it was still a little confusing to them.  Once I told them the designer of the game was the same designer as one of their favorites, Forbidden Island, they started to get the comparisons of the flood cards to the infection rate cards and the treasure cards to the player cards.

Update, after several plays through with my 10-year-old and a similarly aged friend, this one is a winner.  We seldom beat the game but they really enjoy it, as do I.

This may displace Lord of the Rings as the best cooperative game (of course, in my opinion) and I still really like LOTR.

The theme here works extremely well. The rules are tight and not complicated. The graphical representations are very intuitive. I really felt like we were fighting epidemics. Nicely done!

You'd think that being able to tell people pretty much exactly what you have in your hand would distill the game down to a puzzle that any lone person could solve. The danger with a coop game is always that one dominant personality (or person with more experience) is going to start dictating to others what to do...and then, why are the others playing?  I thought that might be an issue here, but it was not. There was enough dynamic stuff going on that each player could contribute to the overall plan.

But what really makes Pandemic shine is the variable player powers. Firstly, you KNOW one of the powers is not going to be in the game. Secondly, there are natural activities each person can do better than the others. Finding a way to work as a team was a very enjoyable challenge. It also gives a sense of ownership to the actions, even if someone else suggested the move...it was ONLY your character who could do it.

Finally, the whole package fits easily under an hour. And its not easy to win. I'd like to add this one to my collection....and I think it will appeal broadly to casual gamers.

A great example of a game that doesn't wear out its welcome. You will win or lose this one in 45 minutes or less, and often want to play again immediately.

Game play-wise, this is clearly one of the best games ever made. I've never played a game that will make you want to stand up and cheer quite the way "Pandemic" will on occasion. Still, I don't quite love it. Maybe it's because it can almost make you want to smash the table sometimes, like when an unlucky starting draw results in your losing via chained outbreaks by turn four. Maybe it's the relentless difficulty or the fact that it's just too pressure-filled to feel like a relaxing good time. And let's not forget "Alpha Gamer Syndrome," where one pushy player can start bossing everyone else about. Still, I love that the game encourages players to talk and strategize. It really is a great game. I just wish I loved it more.

RATING: 7
Pandemic is the newest in the recent fad of cooperative games, and seems to be one of the more promising entries for fans of straight Euro games.

Pandemic presents a deceptively simple concept: the board is seeded with disease cubes, and after each player's turn, more cards are drawn which create or amplify the disease issues. When an area would have more than 3 cubes placed into it, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease to the surrounding areas and generally causing chaos. The game is based on cooperation, and each player has a special ability that can allow them to combat the diseases in a slightly more efficient way: for instance, the medic allows a player to completely clear a city of disease for 1 action rather tha the 1 cube rate of the other characters.

Over the course of the game, players are also collecting city cards in the 4 coloured suits of the game. When someone has 5 of a colour, they can cash them in at a research station to cure the disease, and then it's just a matter of stamping it out on the board. If that is done successfully, then any cards representing that disease are ignored.

The thing that makes this game insidious is the epidemic mechanic. When an epidemic card is drawn from the "good deck" (which each player receives 2 cards out of each round) then all hell breaks loose on the board: a card is drawn from the bottom of the deck, and that place becomes triple diseased, and then the discard deck and that card are reshuffled and placed ON TOP of the negative deck. What this means is that the same cities keep reappearing, and when you combine that with the negative impact of having more than 3 cubes in a given city, the game can get ugly quickly.

So in terms of concept, this is an interesting game, certainly one of the best coops that I've played. The game is essentially one long puzzle game where each player has 4 action points to spend, and in-depth strategy discussions tend to break out as regularly as the diseases. The game is challenging enough to be interesting as well, which is a key for long-term interest.

The downsides, however, primarily do relate to the difficulty of the game. Though difficulty is partially dictated by the number of epidemic cards that are seeded into the positive deck, the game's difficulty also hinges heavily on how the negative deck ends up stacked. If one area's cards are all clustered at the top of the deck, a single early epidemic card can absolutely ream the players before they can even get going. Conversely, a very dispersed card distribution in the negative deck, or a run of the same colour early in the positive deck can make the game fairly relaxed, as a run of the same colour from the positive deck will result in an easy early cure or two, and dispersed diseases, when they occur, rarely will lead to outbreak chains. This isn't to say that the game is easy to win even given these circumstances, because the end can sneak up on you, but the ideal game experience seems to be somewhere in-between, and I'm not sure if there's a way to artificially manufacture that while still keeping the uncertainty that makes this game interesting.

I think my final feelings on this are pretty positive though. It's a short game with some interesting decisions, and some funny moments. If I'm in the mood for a game in this style (hourish co-op), it would probably be my first pick pretty easily but it's not exactly sitting in a crowded niche, and in a longer time frame I would prefer Knizia's LotR or (with 2) Arkham. 

As of 2016 I'd have to say this is great as a couple's co-op title, but that the Legacy version makes it a pale a bit by comparison.

As an aside: nice component quality: big cubes, thick, weighty cards, a sturdy but not overly glossy board. Kudos to Z Man for the job that was done on this one.

I was never a fan of cooperative games until I played Pandemic.  

My girlfriend isn't big on direct conflict, either. Evidently playing at killing each other isn't her idea of a romantic date night. She's works in a medical field, so one weekend, when she invited some co-workers over for dinner, I picked up a copy of Pandemic for us all to play. 

Now, it's our go-to rainy day game.

When you are making a co-op game, you want it to be challenging, thematic, and colorful.  Well, at least this one comes with a wide variety of difficulty settings... it's a shame it is so plain and repetitive.  And while almost all co-ops have the players competing against a randomness generator, here that generator is too dull and predictable and arbitrary to really engage you.  In the end, this game can't really hold up to the storytelling power and intricate game play of something like Arkham Horror or Red November.

Fun co-op game. Hardest thing I had to get over was that it truly doesn't give you a true sense of completion after the endgame which is to find a cure for four diseases. Even when you have found cures for them, there are still disease cubes scattered around the world, but that doesn't matter, because you beat the game once all 4 cures have been found. What? Oh don't worry about New York and the 3 cubes still sitting on it, we have a cure, let's pack up and go home.

On the other hand I would not play this anymore without adding at least one expansion.

I don't know why this one is so popular.  It's another where people can get more controlling and it gets less fun.  As you go the game gets more fun the more trouble you're in but the ending always feels anticlimactic.  It get's more and more out of control and then suddenly, nevermind, you won, game over.

An excellent cooperative game!  You can increase or decrease the difficulty of the game, which is a nice feature.  Also, while the Medic seems to be the most powerful of the roles, each role actually can be critical in winning the game.

One of the most refreshingly different 2+ player games you could ever play with non-BGGs. Where are my empty medicine bottles...thats such a cool idea!
Added tuckboxes.
At the start, 6 'epidemics' are difficult with 2 players, but after many plays it almost becomes easy. Replayability for 2 players is offset by player experience and luck. THe expansion variants correct this by trading luck for the desired effect.
This game is politically correct.

I Have not played the second edition. The standard 'four cures' victory is far too easy in an experienced group and going for total eradication increases the challenge significantly. Some players usually end up feeling left out when others propose alternative moves that the team prefers.

Brilliant game with solid mechanics, difficult but fair.

Everyone I've played with enjoys this game it quite simply works as a board game in all enjoyable aspects.

On the brink, expansion adds some great variations to the base game and is really recommended. The bio-terrorist adds some fun conflict, and the virulent strain cards keep the game fresh.

RATING: 9
Pandemic is every bit as good as I had hoped! I enjoy co-operative games and this one succeeds well. Gameplay is relatively simple and easily summarised on the cards provided. And the mechanics of spreading disease are disturbingly beautiful and ingenious. My only gripe with it is that victory can feel a bit cheap when you get all four cures but the diseases themselves are still rampant. It's a "win" but it just doesn't feel right to me.

It lived up to the hype. I played this at Gamex 2008 in Los Angeles, and it loved it. The growing tension made the game thrilling and the fact that it plays fast is really nice.

Probably still my favorite cooperative game, especially when combined with the "On the Brink" expansion to increase the variety of roles and cards.  Having said that, still not a game that I'd want to play on every gaming session, but good to pull out on a semi-regular basis.  

Like most co-ops, could suffer from a "leader" syndrome where one (experienced) player tries to control the action, so don't let such a person be the killjoy in the group.  ;-)

Summed up entirely by "co-operative gameplay." Avoid the following types of players: the obnoxious know-it-alls, the loud and excitable, the control freaks, the slow thinkers, the recklessly independant, the stubborn 'I know better'-ers. Conversly, Pandemic offers a fantastic experience that uses great mechanics to tell a thematically relevant story. Just depends on who you ask.

The Co-op game that started them all.  All of the roles you can pick are good choices.  Individually the roles are balanced, but some can synergize extremely well together with certain others making their composite even stronger than they were individually.  It can give a very rewarding experience when you win because you're always doing it just as things to be spiraling out of control and everybody gets to do something important and so, will feel important.

One of a couple games that Katie and I have wildly varied opinions on.  This was one of our first cooperative games and I enjoyed it quite a bit at first.  As time has gone on though, I now find it rather dull.  It seems, from the games we have played, that there must be an extensive amount of discussion and debate on who should do what in order to be successful in this game, and that causes the game to drag on much longer than it ought to.  I have found that I would rather rush through this game and lose than draw it out for a long while and win.  I'm also not a big fan of the board and components.  Ironically, I quite enjoyed the variants introduced with Pandemic's expansion pack, but Katie and others have not.  In the end, when it comes to fighting cooperatively against wooden cubes, I much prefer Flash Point over Pandemic.

My favourite gaming moment so far: Hailey asking my mum to learn to play Pandemic closely followed by mum asking dad to play that night. Now both my kids and both my parents love it.

This has become my most played game very quickly. It is excellent with any number of players. Everyone has liked it so far, many love it.

Great game so far. It sucks you in to thinking it will take it easy on you then bam. Epidemics and outbreak chains go out of control. 
I love the balance of this game. Balance of defence (treating victims) and attack (researching cures) is critical.

geberus helped me get this by holding a copy for Kami at Source Comics and Games in Minneapolis when it was off the shelves faster than orders could be made almost. Thanks.

After watching games with Hayden, I decided to teach my 6 and 7 year olds this game. My daughter loves it.


Second copy picked up from Dean for Mitchell

Victories against legendary in all combinations of 2 characters of the original game. Eradication or lucky card draws is almost necessary to make it happen.

I managed to win a game with 6 Epidemics with no outbreaks and all diseases eradicated with my daughter as the Medic and me as the Dispatcher. Awesome win.

BSW makes Pandemic tedious.

What a great game! Looks like it could become a family favorite. This was our first true cooperative game experience. The theme is amazing and plays throughout the game. It is very fun and exciting. Currently playing it a bunch solo (occasionally with a variety of homemade variations). This is a modern classic. Trying to save the world from multiple epidemics is a wonderful night of fun entertainment. Being able to play a game with the family or friends instead of against them makes for an enriching game experience. Will be looking to pick up more cooperative games.

One of my new favorite coop games. It is the spiritual evolution to Shadows Over Camelot. Same basic concept, the players do some good actions (treat some cities), then do a bad one (infect some other cities). I think my favorite part is being able to adjust the difficulty of the game. Shadows has the advantage of having a traitor though, Pandemic is fully co-op.

July 28, 2008 -- I was introduced to this last week, and in one session I played four games of it. I was pleasantly surprised to find the game is fun, requires a fair bit of thought and is not easy for the players to win. Its quick play time makes it a clear winner. I must buy this. 9/10

January 15, 2010 -- After eight plays, I finally experienced a win. It was close. We were down to our last turn of drawing cards into our hands, so the time limit was just about to kill us. It was a three-player game, and we had done quite well keeping outbreaks from happening with any great frequency. We'd just barely pushed the Infection Rate to 4. With the medic, researcher and scientist, we barely beat the clock.

I find Pandemic continues to be tense and interesting. Now that my girlfriend has experienced its fun and is asking to play it, I expect it to hit the table a lot more often.

No change in rating. 9/10

Fantastic game for us with a theme that's right in my sweet spot.  My son doesn't like a lot of conflict at this stage so his first question now whenever I pull out a new game is "Is it cooperative?"  He and I have played this together a few times now (I let him be the medic each time since it makes him feel powerful to be able to wipe out multiple cubes within a city and it keeps him interested in playing) and enjoyed every play.  I also love the fact that it can be played solo since I don't always have readily available playing partners.

Really enjoy this game.  Rules are easy to learn and strategy makes sense.  Game can definitely get out of hand quickly, but it's a fun intensity.  So far I have only beaten the game once and that was on the easiest play setting of only using 4 epidemic cards. Will update is this changes!!

My first co-op game - great player interaction.  The mechanics are super and suit the theme.  It's a great game to learn more about your friends and how they problem solve/interact.  It has good replayability but can stale a little (maybe because ultimately I like to be competitive).

Pandemic was the first co-operative game after the venerable Lord of the Rings by Reiner Knizia, and when I first played there was some unexplicable 'click' between me and the design. It took me a few years and horrendous encounters with other co-ops to realise what the reason for this strange alchemy was: the fact that all actions you do as player [i]succeed[/i], with utmost certainty. The game obviously throws quite a lot of random shit at you... but players are always sure about what they are doing. This has since become an absolute necessity for me to like a co-op, and so Pandemic has stayed with me throughout the years.

That said, it took me a while to learn how to play to win, and when I finally did something of the magic vanished. Making the game harder would be tantamout to 'merely' optimising the various semi-strategical paths built into the combination of various roles. While not easy, it amounts to working out the solution to a puzzle rather than creatively gaming oneself out of a tight spot. For this reason I've decided to lower the rate I've given it all those years ago. Perhaps that with the expansions (especially the Bioterrorist one which endows the spread of diseases with actual intelligence, we hope...) the actual game can be redeemed.

Probably the best non-Arkham cooperative game, but still not great.  Gameplay is a bit rote (where's the nearest spot the dispatcher can teleport us to where we can exchange cards?), and it doesn't have the thickness of theme or drama inherent to skill checks that Arkham does that makes it all worthwhile.

I really like cooperative games because it just plain feels good when everyone wins together. Pandemic has that feeling combined with a save the world (from the cubes) theme, and this makes for an excellent experience for all players. It lacks some depth and replayability, so its not going to get a ton of plays (edit:I guess I was wrong), but pandemic has been a hit so far with everyone who has tried it.

Interesting coop.  Played twice in a row and lost twice in a row.  I don't mind.  I had just played as the traitor in Shadows over Camelot and it was hard to think about sabotaging things.   If one of the diseases isn't turning people into zombies, I am not playing though.

Fills it's niche in my collection perfectly, but the whole experience seems somewhat transparent after a while.

I actually found it a bit frustrating to play with others, after having played it solitaire perhaps a bit too much.  It's hard to know when to stop telling everybody what to do and let them play as they will (lest ye become a tyrant).  If you love somebody, set them free... to cause billions of deaths.

Fun cooperative game with interesting plague mechanic. Pieces are simple (bowling pin pawns and infection cubes), but made out of wood and nicely painted. You can play at several difficulty levels, but any above Introductory are brutally difficult. This becomes frustrating when you hit 2 "Epidemics" in the first two rounds of the game, causing several Outbreaks.

Also be sure to watch out for the Alpha Gamer, who may just tell other players what to do. For this, playing with your hand concealed may be necessary. Most groups can get along well enough so that eveeryone can contribute to the strategy of curing diseases.

Such an excellent game!  I love that it plays so tensely and that you can never seem to get ahead -- just when you think you have things under control, you pull an epidemic and the players are in inconvenient places and you're barely scraping by again.  I think this game is much more fun to play when there is less groupthink and everyone plays independently and just confirms their plans with the group.  This game is a particular treat in that it plays well with just 2 players and plays quickly.  The On The Brink expansion is a must for repeated plays, if only for the additional Role cards.

Puzzly co-op classic with straightforward rules and a nice tension to it. The core game holds up even when compared to the legacy format of the more recent titles, making this preferrable if you don't have a group that's ready or steady enough for the 12+ games Pandemic Legacy takes to complete.

I love this game! We actually play with our hands up on the table and we all work together to defeat the viruses. The key is finding people that are a good match to play coop games with.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  People who argue that the game is boring must be doing something wrong, because to me, it seems full of tenseness and anticipation - will the next draw contain an epidemic - Aaargh! Another outbreak. Every game we play, we either win or lose by just a hair. Extremely nail-biting, definitely contains the bang for the buck.

The theme and gameplay come together well, haven't tried any of the expansions yet. It's fun but my biggest complaint is that the difficulty doesn't scale very well with added players. It seems pretty easy with few players, but gets really difficult with large groups because developing cures is hard before running out of event cards.

Interesting cooperative game.  Fun to play with the expansion.  This is one of my favorite coop games and the players tend to work together quite well in my games played.

The first few plays were amazing, and is what really pushed me into the deep end of this hobby - it broke my "no games over $40" rule, which lasted like a month.

Nowadays, it would take a lot of convincing to get me to play the original Pandemic ever again, now that I've played Pandemic: The Cure and I'm part-way into Pandemic Legacy Season 1.

Pandemic is a great game that continues to hit the table. It is a favorite of my nephews and really encourages team work. I have played Pandemic with non gamer friends with much success. The rules flow well and everything fits the theme quite well. It isn't super heavy but it is a joy to play and interact with fellow players. I was actually shocked at how tense it can get at times. I have had several gamers comment on being nervous and it stressing them out; I say that is awesome since the theme is saving the world from disease. I don't think that should be taken lightly. :)

EDIT: (ADD) I believe ZMAN lists the age as 8+ now instead of 13. I would say that a 8 year old with a good attention span should be very capable of playing Pandemic. My 10 year old nephew loves this game and is quite strategic when playing.

RATING: 5
It’s a good cooperative game. It has some good game play
	• everyone is involved 
	• replayability is good
	• there are many ways to win
	• its challenging
The downside is that it starts slow. Especially if you are having to stop and read the rules over and over. Controlling the diseases at first seems too simple and arbitrary. Some people, like Walker, have lots of good ideas how to attack the disease. If a player isn't getting the hang of it they can feel like they are just being told what to do and may lose interest. 

Just when you decide you don't like the game, there are several outbreaks and suddenly you lose -leaving you with the desire to play again. It turns out that its hard to beat the game even in its easiest configuration. 

I figure that if we play the game routinely enough we'll keep the rules fresh in our minds and will enjoy the game more. 

Oddly, the goal is to avoid outbreaks but the outbreaks add excitement to the game. When I play I secretly hope for outbreaks. 

The overall experience is that I don't actually look forward to playing it but I enjoy it when I do.

Pandemic is one of the greatest designed games I have ever played.  Co ops are hit or miss with me but Matt Leacock really knows how to dial them up.  The so called AI of the game (which is really just drawing form a deck of cards) works SOOOOO brilliant.  It's one of the most fair AI's I've seen in co op gaming.  The epidemics being shuffled evenly into the deck makes the game even more balanced.  You know when your about to draw one because you haven't drawn one in a while or maybe you drawn two in a row and you know you have a break.  The variability which is created from the epidemic deck/roles you play with is amazing.  Every game is different.  There are so many different strategies you can go with.  Do you do rush to find a cure?  Go heavy on building research stations?  Early trading?  I can go on but man is this game amazing.

I cannot play this game well. I don't want to learn how to either. I wouldn't enjoy it even if I could play it well. I don't like the mechanics and the theme doesn't interest me.

I'll be interested to see if Defenders of the Realm will manage to not be sold. I hear it is similar.

Make it too hard and we can just sit around a table knowing how to min/max the game enough to eek out a win every now and then while we talk all of the chance out of a game. Way to ruin everything.

Pandemic is a fine game if you don't try to control everybody's moves and are resigned to the fact that you and your team will most likely fail.  It's still fun even if you lose because it was probably stressful and exciting all the way through.  The game can be tense and exciting, which are strong attributes of any game.  Pandemic is a keeper and is one that can be used to easily gateway non-gamers into the hobby.

Cooperativo sobresaliente. Pero el efecto líder es poderoso, hay que ir con cuidado. Un jugador experimentado puede llevar de la mano a los demás. A parte de eso, muy bueno. Diferentes niveles de dificultad, para los que ya piensan que lo han dominado. La dificultad máxima es brutalmente despiadada, un verdadero rompecabezas sobre como optimizar movimientos.

RATING: 7
An extremely clever but curiously soulless cooperative game. The mechanic through which infected cities get recycled back on top of the deck is simple but outstanding; it creates a compelling narrative arc and ratchets up the tension pleasantly in tune with the course of the game. The differing roles help differentiate  options and the constant board changes between turns ensure constant tactical reappraisals and adjustments. And at short and breezy, the length is right too.

On the other hand, mechanically the game is also very much a dry mathematical optimization exercise, with little thematic heft or draw. Nothing within is evocative of any research enterprise, medical field work, or disease epidemic, which robs some appeal from the design. Still, it really is one of the best cooperative games out there, if you play at a reasonable pace and can get past the fact, like all such games, opportunities for true individual decisions are rare.

Awesome cooperative game. The rules are straightforward so it's easy to learn and to explain to new players. But the tension and also the challenge increases as the game progresses which makes it great fun to play.

The role cards have different special abilities which provides more variability and so you need to work together as a team to make the most of everyone's special abilities.  

This game is highly re-playable and allows for you to increase your difficulty by adding additional Epidemic cards (4 - Beginners, 5 - Normal, 6 - Hard).

I love this game, it's sooo addictive and GREAT value for money.

RATING: 4
Components: A disturbing theme, with unsettling art. The cubes are nice, but the board is a bit strange, and the cards are substandard.

Experience: The game's engine is up to the task of keeping players on their toes. It's fun to coordinate our efforts, and decide how to most effectively employ our limited resources. But each game feels very similar, and doesn't tell a story.

I'm not usually a fan of pure Co-Ops, but this one's pretty good. It's harder with 4 or 5 (Expansion allows for 5). It's a quick game and you're likely to play it twice in a row when you get it out.

For all intents and purposes a solo play game as everyone knows what everyone else should do, and is quite willing to suggest it readily to ensure the team 'wins'.  Overall a very dull affair, may be improved with a gunboat approach to table talk?  The other issue is, the game is pretty much decided the second the cards are shuffled.  

Obvious plans, a clear end goal, a little dull.

Cassidy and I played this one tonight. This is a really good game, as you play you can see the "Timer" counting down and the in game AI is really good. You and your friends are playing against the game trying to cure diseases. We lost... This game is destined to become a classic. Very simple rules, easy cooperative play, and multiple skill levels make this game one you will come back to. High quality parts and great graphics make it great addition to the collection. Dislikes, the player tokens are HUGE! Not a real problem but they look a bit bigger than everything else on the board.

My favorite co-op game ever, and unlikely to budge from that spot.  Endless replayability, easily scalable difficulty, and (to paraphrase Wil Wheaton) the most fun you can have *losing* a board game.  The fantastic modular expansions are no slouch, either, but vanilla Pandemic is easily my #1 "desert island" board game pick.

RATING: 9
This co-op game can punish you.  Mercilessly.  We've never played on the hardest setting, and have squeaked by with victories on multiple occasions on the last turn before impending defeat.  Lots of tension as you beat back the breakouts.  The only drawback is if one player starts trying to call all the shots.  As long as everyone is engaged and feels empowered to make their own decisions to best help the team, this is a HUGE winner (even in defeat).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm not a huge fan of Pandemic. It's difficult to beat the game if there isn't a "captain" leading everyone's moves. If there is a captain then they are the only one playing the game, everyone else just follows. I haven't tried the expansions to see if this is solved. But not a huge fan right now.

A great gateway game.  One of the best games I have for the mechanics matching the theme; I really get the feeling of viruses spreading around the globe and trying to fight them off in time to save the planet.  Is a cooperative game which is nice but can be subject to Alpha player syndrome where one player tells everybody what to do.  This is a very, very well done game and I would rate this higher but I find I don't always suggest it, probably as I generally prefer a little player conflict in my games...

RATING: 7
First time playing the co-op mechanic.  I found this game's theme to be compelling although the game overall did not blow me away.  The common complaint about the "Dominating Leader" is very appropriate, I feel, as I was just learning the rules for the first time, yet had an experienced player on my team.  Of course, the experienced player eventually took over, telling the other two newbies (including myself) where to go, etc. This robbed me of a very important aspect of a game - the learning process.  Ideally, games should have enough depth that the ideal strategies are not immediately apparent - they should be discovered only after many, many plays.  This gives the player "Eureka!" moments that are extremely satisfying and build a love for that particular game.  Unfortunately, what I'd heard from veteran players is that the ideal strategy to the game is not too hard to figure out, so replayability is limited for me if I ever play with experienced players.  However, I do respect the game because the premise of co-op has layed the groundwork for future game designs, and it has a very original theme in and of itself.

[b]I own the following expansion(s) for the game:[/b]

Pandemic: On the Brink

One of the rare cases, in my experience, in which buying an expansion actually makes the base game even better. 

I generally don't like expansions, but ... This expansion is my favourite game expansion ever and is almost a must to really really enjoy this game. Bought only three days after I bought Pandemic. Highly recommended expansion and the only one I insist buyers who I'm recommending Pandemic to *must* buy.

Really good game. Excellent mechanics and theme, challenging, and a lot of replayability. Only down side is it can seem to be a bit random, and my group tends to win or lose because of the luck of the draw, not the quality of our decisions. We always play on the hardest difficulty now and win about a quarter of the time. When we do, it rarely feels like we played better, but were simply more fortunate. Not a downside for everyone, but for me I would have liked the decisions to count for more than they do.

Slightly anticlimactic feel when you win: "Oh, right. We won. That's nice."  Some fiddly feeling rules about who can give whom cards and where.  Still hard to resist the challenge of saving the world.  We're doing OK so far but only on the 'easy' setting.  On The Brink expansion is a good buy.

Really liked it. Managed to win once on easy, and once on normal. We played with open cards, which I understand is incorrect. I can see that the open cards make it easier...but only if you and your team don't want to talk. I would think talking about your hands rather than seeing them would simply make the game take longer.

On first match I see more options and interesting development than in Forbbiden Island. Good game, very tense.

Classic cooperative fun, but I think I prefer other co-ops such as Defenders of the Realm, Ghost Stories, Yggdrasil, and Shadows Over Camelot. I think of this game as filler but the game always ends up being longer and much more challenging than I expect.

RATING: 8
An excellent cooperative game that requires a lot of cooperation (as opposed to cooperation being only occasionally helpful).  The theme is new and different, and very engaging.  When I introduced the game, we played once, and then returned to it twice more that same day.   To me, that speaks volumes.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good co-op game, though I get the feeling after a dozen or so games there may not be a lot of incentive to continue bringing this one out. The game mechanics are easy to learn and it does a good job of building tension but suffers from a general lack of variety that would compel repeated playthroughs. There are also times where luck of the draw can seriously put you behind the 8-ball before you can gain much of a foothold, making the game an exercise in near-futility. Regardless, Pandemic largely succeeds in offering a satisfying and challenging co-op experience that is accessible to just about everyone.

A fun cooperative that's more intuitive than Space Alert.  We allow ourselves to pick our roles at the beginning of the game, however, instead of leaving it to chance.

The hardcore euro-crowd will hate the randomness, but they forget that without gateway games like this, there would be no new converts to the boardgaming hobby. That doesn't mean you have to like it, but you have to compare it to similar co-op titles and not to, say, Princes of Florence.

Great game with a relatively low barrier to entry. I bring this one to my table pretty often. Easy to teach and a great cooperative experience even for non-gamers. There's a lot of randomness involved which, paired with players being dealt bad roles, can quickly become overwhelming, but still lends itself well to the theme. 

The component quality is great, I love the translucent cubes and the simple, thematic graphic design. I'm definitely interested in picking up some expansions!

I'd call Pandemic the cooperative game that all other cooperative games should be compared to. It has an excellent game mechanic that works well with any number of players. It has a good theme and it gets every player involved. But somehow I just can't shake the feeling that it could be even better and more engaging. Pandemic is a great game that could be a bit more immersive to really get me going. I recommend this game to everybody who likes cooperative games.

This is your standard card game that suffers from the typical card game issue:  card counting

You really have to know what has come up and what to expect in order to play this game right.  Failure to memorize will wipe you out.  In other games (Magic the Gathering) at least you can make your own deck and push %'s.  In this game its pretty much the same thing everytime.

In addition, just like solitaire, you can potentially have a 0% chance to win from the start because fo the shuffle, regardless of your own skill. That kind of sucks IMO.

So with all of that said, this is a game best suited for the 10-16 year olds.  Beyond that the futility of effort probably will annoy you, and the only viable strategy(memorization) will probably bore you.  The younger kids won't realize either of these aspects and probably have fun with it.

RATING: 5.5
Being able to use drawn cards to either enable passing of other cards or cleanup (by travelling) or directly for finding a cure makes for an interesting tension and decisions.

The various abilities give each player a specialised role and working out how best to exploit everybody's skills is the main issue. This keeps the game exciting - I felt everybody was involved even outside their turn, since so much co-operation was truly needed.

Lost 2x. 2nd time may have been a win if we'd realised players could use action points to GET cards.

Losing by so little (and feeling that we had made genuine mistakes earlier on) meant everyone was ready to play it again soon. 

I can imagine the game losing a lot of its charm when it's been 'solved' and failure rests more upon luck than any mistakes. Until then, though, it's a 9.1. I'm curious to see how easily the other role-combinations will be solved after one has been.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
My favourite co-operative game bar none. Everything about this production seems very polished. 

The game mechanic that constantly recycles already infected cities is genius and really piles on the pressure, making victories feel all the more sweet. I also own Forbidden Island, and while it's a good game, Pandemic successfully improves on everything in that game that I wasn't too keen on. 

Play time is not too long either, although I can see it would need the right team of people to stop one person making all the calls.

RATING: 5
Good, challenging game. I enjoy how the game's difficulty can be tailored to the players' desires.  It makes you feel like you've achieved something when you do manage to save the world from infectious disease.

It is a giant puzzle that the group strives to solve.  Sure, one individual could potentially "run" the group, but that won't happen as long as each person is willing to participate in the discussion and planning that takes place.

Thing is, this game is really simple. But when a really simple game manages to be completely different every time you play it, and when you can get your entire table sweating bullets just hoping not to draw an epidemic card this turn OH GOD SHE DREW AN EPIDEMIC CARD...

Must have. Really is.

My favorite game ever at the time of commenting. This game is challenging and forces you to have fun making a strategy and working together with the other players. The theme may be replaceable, but it works quite well. This was the first cooperative board game I ever played. When I played this game for the first time, I had to play again immediately. Win or lose, when I play Pandemic, I want to play again either to beat the diseases that defeated us or to change the set-up and difficulty for a new challenge. This game also has worked perfectly for letting me play with friends who are overly competitive and hostile in competitive games.

I like the idea of Pandemic more than the game. It's a neat theme, saving the world from a global plague. I also like the system, which is very clever--especially how it spreads the diseases and creates hot spots on the map. It just doesn't pull me in, though...also, Its the poster boy for the idea that cooperative games tend to be played by one person who tells everyone else what to do. 

All that being said, boy Pandemic Legacy was a blast!

This is a great game to play with your family, particularly if you have some that are competition-averse. Games can be played in about an hour.

You will get many good plays out of it before it starts to get too easy, and then you can pick up the expansion.

Great co-op game of trying to cure four diseases before they take over the world.  Players each play a role of a team and travel around the world performing various actions, all while the diseases are breaking out somewhere on the other side of the world!  Fun game with lots of tension once the outbreaks stat occuring.  Opening the box, however, smells like I opened a paint can.
I like the randomness of the epidemics and infections in this game; it prevents it from becoming too scripted.
I don't think I'll every suggest this game for my own sake, since it's not meaty enough for me.

Edit: Traded away.  While it's a good game, it's not something I'll ever suggest unless I'm trying to convert non-gamers to boardgaming.  In that case, this game shines.

I love Pandemic. I know Co-ops are not for everyone but my wife and I have wrung immense joy out of this game. Few games create tension like Pandemic does.

I can't say I'm a huge fan of co-ops but I love the design of Pandemic. The way the viruses spread is satisfying and also terrifying at the same time. I can understand why this game gets so much love. Thematically, it's pretty interesting. I feel like it can often turn into a solitaire game in many situations because it's basically everyone looking at the smartest player asking what they think they should do. With the right group though this game can be very enjoyable.

Solid coop game with a nice theme. The game sadly suffers a lot from the fact (at least with everybody I played with) that a more experienced (even one game vs zero) player either has to keep silent or tell everyone else what to do - this is my major gripe with this game. Because most of the time there is a clear "best" turn for whatever strategy you are following, and at the end of the day it feels like one or two people play a game and the others are just there to execute orders, since all information is open.

I do not get the feeling that there are real options as 90% of time there is a clear 'best course of action'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

it would've been good if it weren't for the stupid mechanic of reshuffling the cards and putting them back on top of the deck everytime an epidemic card is drawn. defenders of the realm is 100% better of a game, screw pandemic.

A fun Co-op that, despite the deterministic nature of the game, continues to entertain. It isn't the mechanics of the game that are impressive but the overall experience it creates. Trying to save humanity with your friends is fun; figuring out the optimal strategy and running all the calculations on this game will probably reveal it to be fairly uninteresting.

Still, this game is hard to beat for bringing people further into gaming. It introduces a bit more complexity than games like Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne, so it's a nice stepping stone when you're ready to move past those gateway games and start working towards getting people into heavier games.

RATING: 7
Not bad for a co-op game. Certainly takes plenty of skill and teamwork, and has some innovative and interesting mechanics and rules. Ultimately, I'm afraid that once a handful of priciples are found, the game will turn into a nearly 100% luck-fest. It is all about priorities; chain-infections need to be stopped at all costs, next is making sure that all of a given kind of disease cube isn't exhausted. Once that is under control, focusing on curing the diseases (the only real way to win) is top priority. The only real question then, becomes if your cure deck will run out before you can cure the 4 diseases... that, in turn, largely depends on luck (although low skill will certainly kill you, as long as you keep your priorities straight, luck will dominiate the outcome).

If not for it being a rare co-op game, I'd rate it a 6.

As with any co-op game though, the experienced player will often boss everyone around by telling them the clear choice on what to do with their turn.

First play rating: Clever co-op game, racing around to fight diseases, stop outbreaks, etc.  Played on easy level with three.  Seemed like, after I got a feel for what was going on in the game, the decision pendulum swung between obvious and irrelevant, but had a few mid-arc.  Game mechanisms are sound and I can see it getting really nasty as the difficulty level increases.

Probably the most played game that I currently own. My wife and I often attempt to save the world during dinner. The multiple roles keeps the game relatively fresh.

RATING: 7
Pandemic is an innovative, cooperative game about the spread of disease across our planet. Each player is given a character with a different set of abilities. Cards are flipped and disease bits, of four different types, are placed on corresponding cities on the world map. When a city reaches critical mass, there will be an outbreak that spreads to all of its neighboring cities, potentially triggering a chain of outbreaks. Players win the game by curing each of the disease types and ridding the world of disease entirely. It's a pretty interesting and exciting game, the first few times, working with your team to figure out the best order of operations as plague is breaking out everywhere. I've played a few games, and my only concerns so far are that the space that seperates "We're doing great!" from..."Holy sh*t, my eyes are bleeding and the world will implode in a mass of ebola monkies!" seems far too narrow on the gauge of effectiveness. Replay value may also become limited, when playing with the same group. For a four player game, I wish there would have been like 8 different random character roles, so the game would be different every time. With that said, it plays very quickly (particularly if you get your arse handed to you), it's innovative, and it's a fun cooperative experience. The production is great too. I will recommend it to all my friends, particularly those that like co-op games, and for me, it is a must-buy.

Maybe it's the people we play with, but my wife and I are not big fans of this game.  It seems like every game just devolves into everyone figuring out what everyone else should do.

[March 2015 - 6.6]
My wife and I recently played Pandemic again (after awhile of not playing it) and it left me thinking I was a bit harsh with my initial review. It was a fun game, fairly quick, challenging and exciting. Then, we played it again with some friends soon after ... and my misgivings about this game began to return. That day, we played it twice in a row, and it brought me back to my initial thoughts. People take control, those with the best roles do most of the actions and the rest of the players are left pushing pieces across the board on command. At least the games are fairly fast. I think playing this game two-player every once in a while will keep my interest in it. 

[August 2014 - 6.5]
I'm surprised that Pandemic was No.1 on the Dice Tower's 2014 People's Choice. I'm wondering how many times the voters played the game. From my perspective, the game is pretty good the first few times you play it, but then it begins to lose its luster, especially if you have someone who wants to control the game. That could be said about many co-ops, but I think Pandemic is one or two mechanics away from being a more interesting game. And it would seem that there's an onslaught of new games (eg. Dead of Winter) attempting to take co-ops to the next level. It's good that this one is spreading to the general market though -- I've seen it even in Target.

Although this is pretty grim subject matter, it's still  a crackerjack co-op game that really demands teamwork.  Because of it's challenging nature, veteran players are often tempted to dictate moves to novices and this tends to diminish the experience a bit.

I originally rated this as a 9 and had to raise it to a 10.  The game is so amazing.  It's really simple to learn (the rules are short and simple) and really easy to teach.  I have not had one game where someone said "hey, this is a grey rules area...." because it is all so simple and clear.  But the game is anything but easy.  Some games, we get blasted in 15 minutes while others go right down to the wire and we win or lose by a thread.  Tense, fun and highly addictive.  Since it plays in 45 mins (max), people always want to keep playing until they win.  And everyone who plays with me seems to run out and buy it.  This is one of the best games I have ever played and I have played quite a lot.  Give it a shot if you have not already done so.

[2009-11-25 Rating: n.a. -> 7.5]

Overview:
--------------
Pandemic is a cooperative game where 2 to 4 players try to save the world by curing four deadly diseases. The map of Pandemic depicts the world with various cities. After each players turn, some of these cities are infected by placing cubes in it. If the infection rate of one of the four diseases reaches a cube limit of three in one city and this city gets infected again, an outbreak will occur and the disease will spread.
On their turn, a player can take up to four actions. These actions include:
- Travelling to another city.
- Building a Research Station (these are needed to find the cure for a disease and to travel faster)
- Lowering the infection rate of a city by being in it and removing some of the infection cubes.
- Exchanging city cards with other players.
- Finding a cure by being in a city with a research station and discarding a set number of city cards in the diseases colour.
After their turn, the player draws two new city cards and infects some new cities. After this, the play continues with the next player until one of the game endings conditions is met. These are:
1. Players run out of cubes representing one disease.
2. Players have 8 outbreaks happen.
3. Players run out of cities cards to draw.
4. Players find the cures for all four diseases.
Since Pandemic is a cooperative game, all players win the game when the fourth ending condition is met. If one of the other game ending conditions is met, all players lose and the game wins.

Comments:
---------------
* The card mechanism to infect new cities is really clever and well thought out. Because of its implementation, the same cities get infected again and again. While this puts some pressure on you, this also keeps the game from being too random or too deterministic (and thereby solvable). While you don’t exactly know when an infected city will be infected again, you do know that it will happen for sure. So there is some risk management and push your luck built into the game. I like this.

* The cooperative aspect has it pros and cons. What I like is the fact that I can easily get my non gamer friends to join in for a game of Pandemic. Since all players act together, there is no competition and this is quite appealing to them. The drawback of the missing competition is that some of them are not really involved in the game since they do rely completely on the evaluation of the other participating players. An often heard comment in this regard is: "I like this game because I don’t have to think that much. You can tell me what to do". This kills the fun a little for me.

* After playing my first few games I would have rated this game 9. After more plays with some of my gaming friends my desire to play this game cooled down a little bit. I still enjoy the theme immensely, but with experienced players I discovered the puzzle aspect of the game more and more. Basically the game is won if you manage to optimize your action selection. With experience, it is often times quite easy to see the best play and the discussions about the actions to be taken are replaced by a mutual agreement. I have to see if this issue is addressed in the expansion.

* Great replayability thanks to the different role cards and the great infection mechanism.

* I love the theme and it really helps to get new players to join in for a game of Pandemic.

RATING: 6
A quick and easy game to understand, and a very family-friendly game, that almost anyone in the household can participate in.

The game itself is quite entertaining, as long as you get the right combination of roles. We had a lengthy discussion about whether the roles were imbalanced, which was due to some characters being less useful than others. The doctor is amazing, as well as the scientist guy, whereas the coordinator and the quarantine guy, whom is very specialized. In the end, we reckoned that a way to get around this, if it is an issue, would be to acquire the roles, and then adjust the difficulty. In that way, you make sure that if you get a bad combination or a very good combination, that the game is adjusted for that. 

This is normally only needed if you have a group that is used to playing board games, whereas playing with the family, it might just be hilarious to loose, which is kind of the point of this game I guess.

I've lost this so many times, but I keep coming back for more because it's fun and I want to win and can see we were a turn away from winning. That knife-edge quality is what makes the game great along with the variable player powers. The main issue is the problem with all cooperative games: that a player or players can sometimes dominate the group's decision making. But if everyone participates equally, it's a truly brilliant, thematic design.

Well, when I first played this game, I thought "Wow! This is a must own game."  But now, as time has gone by, and I've had a chance to play other co-op games such as Red November, I find that I just do not care that much for co-op games.  I'm not really sure why, they just don't "grab" me, and they seem to lack the ever-elusive "fun factor" that I'm looking for.  The only exception being Arkham Horror, and that only because of the way the theme is so outstandingly integrated throughout the whole game.  Yeah, I'll play this if someone offers, but it's not one that will end up in my game closet.

My first cooperative board game, and this is a challenging game with an interesting automated intelligence built into it as far as how the virus proliferates and spreads. This game is light enough to make it accessible, but it can be too light for me sometimes. I do enjoy it, and it is fun to get other people into the game that don't like confrontation between players, and yet it isn't always enough to scratch my strategic itch. A solid game, though, and worth the money if you need a good gateway co-op.

No doubt about it - this is a very good game.  But it is a coop game and thus essentially a solo experience, since any multiplayer cooperation game is a pointless gaming exercise.  Thus, a comparatively low rating for a well made game that I have no desire to play.

RATING: 8.5
This is my favorite cooperative game so far.  It is fairly simple for how rich the theme is.  

It is still a bit too complicated to be one of my wife's favorites, but she would gladly play a game of this weight every once in a while.  Right now, her "heavy" game is Dominion, so I have not tried to introduce her to Pandemic yet.  She only has 1 slot for games of this level of complication (and it's filled for now).

--EDIT--
I have now played with the wife and she seems to enjoy it a little, which means it will hit the table some.  But even if I don't play this with my wife, I'll probably break it out on occasion if others, so I raised my rating from 7 to a 7.5.

The best cooperative game ever :-) Period. A simple but very clever "opponent". Thanks to the role cards, Pandemic is a game with a great replay. A classic aside Acquire or Ticket to Ride.

Very nice cooperative mechanic with a realistic sense of thrill and suspense.

Plays well (and fast) with any number of players.

Can also be played in Solo as master operator and open ends.

Great to be able to set difficulty level a little bit like a video game.

Replay factor is quite high here because of cooperation and game duration.

RATING: 7
Fairly light but clever coop game. I suspect repeated frequent plays may make it feel a bit samey and lacking a variety of strategies - the different roles (with at least one missing per game) may help in this regard.

Unique and challenging cooperative game. I really like the teamwork element - if you don’t work well with your fellow players then you will lose! Beating it for the first time was oh so satisfying. Good amount of strategy but not so much as to put off the more casual gamer. Board and components look good too.

Lots of variety especially when you add the expansion (and even there all I have used is the additional role cards and occasionally event cards; I have not used the purple virus or the bioterrorist variant). Pandemic has been a hit with every group I've played it with. Simple mechanics, but it fits the theme very well. I was worried at times it would get too simple and maybe I just am lousy at the game but it still provides a good challenge.

RATING: 2
If you love playing scratch'n'win tickets this game is very similar, except there's no chance of winning any cash. It's kinda like playing multiplayer solitaire: once the decks are shuffled, it's bascially predetermined whether or not your win or lose.  Just go through the motions of playing it out.

I will never play this again unless they come out with a Bio-Terriorism expansion introducing a "traitor"-type player to the game.

Great game of cooperation that actually works. Every game is tense and your always on the brink of disaster. It's clearly winnable but you won't win every time.

This is a cracking game which has gone down well in all circles including hardcore gamers to nongamers it is a great gateway game despite being cooperative I've found that rather the experienced players telling the new people what to do that the new players quickly pick up the rules and start making their own decisions. I've even tried bringing it into work under the guise of a team building exercise, the week after that I brought in Dominion for more team building and that just decended into a new board games club quicker than I could say "Oh, fancy a new hobby?".

It's a pretty good cooperative game.  But that said, it is a "cooperative" game.  Everyone gets together and tries to figure out the best mathematical chance of beating the system.  You can play it in 20 minutes (and probably lose) or spend over an hour trying to debate and optimize every possible move.  Not really my favorite genre.  I like that they tried to tie it to a cool theme.  But really, there's barely enough meat on it to keep it from falling into the "abstract" category.

I bought Pandemic because it was difficult to find, and because my girlfriend had already started to show an interest in cooperative games like Arkham Horror. Unfortunately, soon after this I decided to buy Arkham Horror itself and we have not played Pandemic since then. Despite Pandemic's short playing time, it didn't seem to be quite as fun for as Arkham Horror, and thus rarely got play.

Fast, cooperative game where four anonymous diseases (Red Dandruff, Blue Pox, Galloping Mumps and Coeliac Disease in our house) are spreading across the globe.  Players are members of a response team to contain and cure the horrible beasties.  Fairly standard cooperative game (i.e. Lord of the Rings) stuff - first do a little bit of good in the fight (move, research, treat, etc), then advance the bad side of things, possibly triggering consequences.  Tightly designed, attractively packaged (despite the enormous pieces, small board and the fact the game truly reeks of some chemical .... paint?).  Three differently levels of difficulty.  Five games in and we're pretty much done - fast, tight, but very vanilla for a cooperative game.

Unfortunately played to death in my group. That's a good thing, though, cus for a while we couldn't get enough of it. Co-op game play, impending doom, playing the odds strategy.

Damn is this game good!  I'm blessed with a group of gamers who are willing to collaborate and let each other make their own decisions.  With the right group, this game cuts the perfect balance of tension, randomness and tactical strategy.  At this point we have all of the expansions minus the one just released.  We are working our way through each one now and we are looking forward to getting a big enough group to try out the eco- terrorist module.  This one is a keeper.

This game is really well designed, has a large, gorgeous board, and very nice components.  It plays really smoothly and really provides a lot of tension as you struggle to keep the viruses under control.  Unfortunately I am not a big fan of co-op games, I find once you play them a couple of times, additional plays feel repetitive.  I'll hang on to this game since I think it is so well designed, and it will serve as the co-op game I will rely on if I find myself needing or wanting to play one.

Update: I never feel like playing co-ops so I sold this to a friend.

This game is as much about the people you play with as the game itself.  My cousins hated this game because it was too tense, but that's one of the reasons I love it; there's always a sense of impending doom.

Cool theme, great mechanics.

Pandemic is quick to play and easy to teach to others. My wife loves to play which is a big plus. Some roles, while important are not that engaging (Medic). I was playing the game too much on the introductory level as I kept playing with new players; on normal its much more challenging. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
+ It’s a great gateway game that brings people together and everyone I introduced it to enjoys it greatly. After setting the game up, the game plays smoothly without fiddling with tons of components. Also, it is casual enough where I can walk away; change my daughter’s diaper and come back still knowing the situation of the game.
- As with many cooperative games, this game can suffer from the Alpha Gamers taking over and you end up watching him move cubes around. Other than that, this game can be light on strategy and can suffer from bad shuffles that lead to easy wins. Certain roles can deem very powerful, such as the Quarantine Specialist or the Medic, and can help an easy win become a steamrolled victory.

A blast with my family. 4 games and 2 wins in simplest mode. If we have gathered together in this squad more often than once per month, it would have had a lot more plays.
I already bought On the brink expansion and I'm waiting for perfect moment to include it. I'm especially intrigued by the eko-terrorist mode.
For solo mode I'd prefer Cthulhu version, as I love such grim and evil atmosphere, but I know that it wouldn't hit the table at all with family, and buying both version is a bit too much for my wallet.

This is one of my favorite cooperative games. You are tasked with trying to find the cure for 4 different types of viruses/diseases, and you have to work with other players to stop them from spreading and find cures. Each player is given a role card, each role had a different advantage to help the team. Throughout the game you have to work as a team, otherwise you can lose control pretty quick. There are 4 ways to lose the game, and only one way to win. Communication, teamwork, and using ones role advantages strategically are the key to this game.

*My group likes to add to the fun by coming up with names for each virus. For example, black = zombies, red = bird flu, yellow = smallpox, blue = common cold.*

*For an added challenge, if we have a good group and the right roles, we try to eradicate each virus to beat the game. (this is very hard)*

I really want to play the legacy version of the game, as well as all the other versions.

Cons: Players who are not into it and don't communicate or work together. Sometimes we have players who thing this is a competition and go off on their own, which never wins a game.

Four deadly diseases have broken out across the globe, and the players must frantically go from city to city treating the diseases and looking for cures.  Pandemic was one of the original co-ops, and the inspiration for Defenders of the Realm and Forbidden Island among others.

The mechanics are interesting and the theme is strong. However the fun factor can be greatly reduced if played by the wrong crowd, which happened to me during my first two games.

This games overall theme is great. I like that its a cooperative game where the sole enemy is disease. It is a nice change of pace from my normal game night. The play time is also short, so that is always a bonus if you want to play another game on the same night. The game takes about ten minutes to learn and even then you might be doing some things wrong. It takes about five to six plays to really get a handle on what to do. I rank the game lower than I would normally just based on the difficulty of the game. Out of fourteen plays we have only won twice, and both times were a two man game. Now this might be because my group isn't using the right strategy. It is fun and I don't mind playing it here and there, but it is quickly falling out of favor in our group.

After 6 plays, we finally managed to beat the game on regular difficulty.  Up to that point we lost every way possible and eventually decided that to boost moral we'd all sponsor a different disease and if that disease was the one that killed us then that player "won".  Very satisfying cooperative game without too many complicated rules.  Very elegant and fun.

Got a little boring after 40 plays or so, but a good one for quite a while.

One of the more famous "serious" board games, it's a race to save the world from a pandemic! Similar to Forbidden Island (and I think might even be easier) the theme is a bit more fun, and with clever abilities and different roles you'll always be reaching for it. It does have the issue that one or two players may dominate the game and just be telling everyone what to do. And to be fair, one of my games I was distracted by the cat I had at the time and was fine with it.

Great co-operative game.  The first real co-operative game I had played.

This has become one of my favorites.  A game I can introduce to non-gamers, a game to play with the family, and a game I can play with gamers.  

Even after many plays, I am still intrigued by this game and want to play more...not less.

RATING: 5
It's good that the difficulty is selectable in this game.  They seemed to have done a good job balancing it.   The tension is excellent, but I think the game will get repetitive quickly.   It also suffers from that fact that it is more of a multiplayer puzzle than a game.  Everybody agrees what should be done, and there is very little opportunity for style or choice.  It's kind of like getting your friends together to change the head gasket on your car.  There's some similarity to Shadows Over Camelot if you look under the hood - move around and collect sets of cards.   That's it.  The movement is a little more important here than Shadows. Still, it's nice to have a fresh co-op style game, but I don't think this game will have any staying power after you have a few wins under your belt.  I suppose expansions will address that needed variability.   Co-ops aren't my cup of tea, so my rating here is on the low side.

As a group game I'm not that much of a fan. Usually the process is people flop their hands down and then work as a group and out of that "group" someone takes over as the main coordinator and most people follow their lead not speaking up too often and then the game ends. The leader did a good job or not. As a solitaire game I think it is pretty fun. Action Points I think is something that seems to be less and less in favor sadly because it is such an intuitive mechanic. And as a solitaire game it turns out to be a nice quick moving puzzle.

I've had to write this a couple times now, but it's important to understand my view on pure co-operative games: I can't find a way to approach them functionally, as I have trouble with the line between involved player and Alpha gamer. I resolve to simply focus on my own play, leaving me quite disengaged for everyone's rounds.

Pandemic does nothing to alleviate this for me - it's essentially a puzzle that the four of you are attempting to solve. The mechanics are sound, and the board looks nice and all that jazz. 

Biggest problem of all: Pandemic Legacy. Now that I've played Season 1, and am partway through Season 2, I don't think I'll ever be able to play a standard game of Pandemic again.

Fun cooperative game but I don't typically want to play with more than 2 players because unless you are playing optimally as a team the game will usually beat you. I dont like to offer up suggestions for what another player should do because it can be hard to do so without sounding like your not really giving the person their own choices. The game encourages you to interact and plan together though, which is why i prefer to play with just 2, or even on my own! Just my personal awkward hang-ups i guess. I always want people to make their own decisions in games and not just follow instructions. Still a great game even if it is very much luck-dependent on harder difficulties. A good gateway game.

I don't get to play cooperative games much so this game would be a fun game occasionally for a change, but it just isn't that fun. I do like how it's not a big commitment and easy to learn, but I miss the added dimension of the traitor found in Shadows over Camelot or the criminal in Scotland Yard.

RATING: 6
Generally, I’m not a fan of cooperative games.  They strike me as less of a game and more of just an ‘activity’ to engage in with friends/co-players.  Its a case of, ‘let’s all get together to play a game of solitaire’ and Pandemic is no different.  I guess what makes Pandemic better than most cooperatives is that: it is, what it is, in its purist form with rules and mechanics that are fast, clean, straight-forward, intuitive and very streamlined.  
With an average game length of about one hour, I feel that’s about the right amount of time for a this game (as long as it doesn’t go over 60 minutes).  The game is essentially a puzzle, but even to the most experienced player, whether you win or lose is randomly pre-determined based on how the cards are, literally, stacked-against-you or for-you before the game begins.  
There are several options every round, but really there is always ONE option that is undeniably best and inevitably it’s the most experienced player that sees it (I’m sure even if he actively choose to hold back, it would be frustrating from his perspective and truthfully not really beneficial to winning the game in the end).  And thus, like most cooperative games, I don’t really feel I have any personal vested interest in the game and just want to sit back and let the alpha-player do his magic.  Thus the nature of cooperatives makes us ask, ‘do we fundamentally play games to win, or is it the game-play that is solely fun.’  If we play to win, then let the alpha-player take the lead.  If we play to enjoy the brain-burning aspect of figuring out a puzzle to best of our abilities, then best to play as a solitaire game (I’m sure it would be a frustrating time for the alpha-player to sit back and let players engage in less-efficient options).  
Perhaps this game really works best as a solitaire game (a field that I have zero interest in).  
Among cooperative games, I currently like 2010’s “Forbidden Island” best.  That game’s 30 minutes game time hits a perfect sweet-spot for these types of games/activities and the theme there is a bit more flavourful and imaginative to hold one’s attention.

Pandemic was one of the earlier members of the co-op trend, and by now has become a little stale.  There's not much I find wrong with it, but it's almost as much puzzle as game.  That leads to people feeling like it can be solved, which leads to playing the turns collectively and analysis paralysis.  I'm at least as much guilty of this as anyone else, but that's how I usually want to play it.  The main thing keeping it back is how much it's been played up to now.
My sole serious dislike is the scaling. With 3, it's harder to cover the globe and more difficult to exchange cards if everyone's widely separated.  But that's preferable to 5, where your coverage really isn't any better, since it takes longer to get back to anyone's turn.  It doesn't do much good to have the medic over in Asia where the black cubes are piling up if 2 more people have to go before him and the cities will outbreak before then.  Worse, the deck is diluted and it's less likely people are going to get sets, so you have to burn more time trading.  The number of turns each player gets is less, since the deck is a timer.  Most of the games I've lost with 5 have been on time, so I feel like it's just a little unbalanced there.

First coop game.  Wanted to love it, but ended up strongly disliking in the 5 different groups I played it in.  Good mechanics, good production, but the style of the game is not for me or the others I've played with. ZZZZzzzz.  Alpha dog or smarter player in the room plays the game while others watch.  Avg solo experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A well-designed game with tension at every level: Can we avoid outbreaks this turn? How much risk should we assume before the next epidemic card surprises us? Can we cure all the diseases before the endgame? Being able to customize the level of difficulty allows you keep the outcome close to 50%. As with any fully cooperative game, it's possible for an alpha player to diminish the experience for others.

I compare all other cooperative games to this one. It's my favorite in the genre.

My first expeience with a co-op game apart from Lord of the Rings, and I really enjoyed it. Rating is based on a single play and first impression. The game utilizes some very innovative mechanics, not the least of which is when the diseases "intensify" by reshuffling the discard deck and placing them back on top of the draw pile. This is an excellent and clever mechanic that had us scratching our heads at first, until the lightbulb of understanding shone upon us...

UPDATE: I've now played this lots of times, and my rating stands.  It is tense and enjoyable, even if fairly random. The intial placement of 3-cube diseases relative to the players' starting position in Atlanta can have a huge impact, as can the randomly selected player roles, when the first Epedemic card turns up, and when the special cards turn up (if they are near the bottom of the deck, they're not going to be of much help). Despite the random aspects, I still really enjoy it. I think it's one of the most innovative games in years.

A must play for people wanting the next step past gateway games (Catan, Munchkin, etc.). It's a challenging co-op game that forces players to combine their unique player ability with smart action-selection to overcome the (sometimes) overwhelming odds. In our first 3 plays, my roommate and I were crushed. We got close, but couldn't quite keep the diseases under control. Then on the 4th try we easily crushed the game. The Epidemic cards were well-spaced in the deck. We got lucky.

A great cooperative game, all the players gonna be talking and making a strategy to save the world, is hard to take a roll alone. 

Is a game that has a stressful goal, where if players make perfect in moves, then they can still lose the game. The rules are simple, the enjoyment and thinking is to the top all the time. Is a better game if you play music according to the game situation (just look for one on Spotify).

In the game, every player controls a character that is a specialist and has a unique ability. Your goal is to create a cure for 4 diseases, that are spreading in the whole world. Every turn the disease's growth, and can make a lot of disasters. Your team has to make quick decisions to don't let the diseases go out of control (outbreak), growth more than can be cured or be late. All of those 3 points are the way your team can lose.

Pandemic is a perfect cooperative puzzle game with a catchy theme. Players are health agents fighting to contain epidemics of deadly diseases around the world. The game is brutal and offers very little chance to win or survive and tolerates no mistakes.
Only drawback is that it can usually happen that one player who is louder and more experienced takes command and dictates what others should do. Also base game offers not that amazing replay value, but either way game is a blast.

[b]Update:[/b] Ranked dropped to 7.5 from 8.5 due to not so great replay value.

Pandemic is simply the greatest board game ever. There isn't one thing that this game doesn't do perfectly. The only thing I could possibly say that this game does "wrong" is that its coop, so if you actually enjoy screwing your friends over, then this game doesn't really allow you to do that. I like the concept of the game, and I'm a scientist myself, so its good to see a game depart from the fantasy/sci fi genre and excel. I love that there is no "bad guy" in the game. I have play lots of other coop games, but I always end up having to be the GM or DM or BAD GUYS or whatever. In this game each person takes their turn, then takes a turn for the viruses. This actually works out great, and makes the game even harder for more players, which is how a game should be. The game is very customizable, allowing for easy rule changes, and differing levels of difficulty that should give you a very pleasing game experience. Where I don't LIKE losing a game, sometimes its actually nice to know that you can indeed, lose even in a coop setting. Really easy to learn for non-gamers as well. I also bought the expansion, and although I like some of it, the game really didnt NEED an expansion in my opinion. Although, Bioterrorist game is quite interesting.

Was the first coop game I ever played and wasn't too enamored with it.  At first I thought I just didn't like coops but as I played other ones I realized I just didn't like Pandemic :)  I think part of it is that the theme doesn't really excite me and I feel like it often turns into one player giving most of the advice.

This game aggravates social dynamics.  

The person who finds the optimal play first always ends up telling the group what that best play is.  The group then feels obligated to go along with it, and it ends up being one person playing the game and pulling everyone else along.  It doesn't matter if the alpha gamer can be gentle and diplomatic about it, rather than domineering and controlling.  They're still the only one playing the game while the rest of the players are just along for the ride.

The danger of this is that if there are pre-existing social dynamics where one player is more strong-willed and another player is more timid, then the gameplay encourages that to be brought out.  I'm a facilitator of games, and I'm concerned with making people feel included in co-operative decisions.  This game makes it harder.

So...if one player dominating a game experience sounds like a good social dynamic to you, or if your playgroup doesn't have any dominant personalities or quick appraisers, then by all means, pick this up.  I'll pass.

Great Coop game. Does not have a TON of replayabliliy, so after about 20 games, it can become a little stale, but very enjoyable early on and anytime new people are playing.

RATING: 7
Too easy!

2:
Great gateway game to introduce to non boardgamers.  This game instantly draws people in to a positive experience in which all the players either win or lose.  

3:
Definitely not too easy.  The game is kind of swingy though depending on which cards come up when.  Therefore, the games can either be a fluke on the easy or hard side.

Very nice mechanic, nice balance between simplicity and complexity. This is a game I really like to play. However, the whole is kind of abstract and it's difficult to live the game. Moreover, the Alpha player is always there, so the game is often boring for beginners.

Mediocre.  Co-op games need a sense of shared narrative for the group to participate in.  Without it, you're just solving a puzzle -- which is exactly what this feels like.

This is an extremely well balanced game. The luck factor is obvious but doesn't overshadow the gameplay. Might become repetitive once you found the best strategies, but right now I'm a missionary for this game.

This is a hit with my girlfriend because of the cooperative play. We are often playing 2 player games; she can be a sore loser if I beat her badly or frequently. Consequently, she'll only play strategy games with me to keep me happy, but I can tell she would rather not.

This game on the other hand she's happy to play. She doesn't mind losing if we're doing it together. We spent a whole night playing this game with thriller/suspense Quarantine type movies playing in the background. She was suggesting we play another game for once, instead of me. 

Your success/demise is sometimes inevitable based on the card shuffle, but it really is a well balanced game. So while there are a few hopeless situations, most of the time you at least feel like you had a chance -- if only a couple things went your way at the end. 

The different player roles add much needed variety.

RATING: 8
Great game. Even if I don't like cooperative games, this one glued me to itslef :D. I initially thught that it's much more repetative, but randomness in cards makes it much different each time you play. The thing that I didn't like the most is the fact that you can "loose" to the game in 1st turn, without ANY chance. Also, too much randomness in card drawing is the reason why it's 8 and not 9.

Quality of the cards is not really great, because in our first 2 games 2 cards got damaged (yes, we were very careful with the game).

It's not difficult, yet it's not unplayably easy. You don't need any gaming experience to be able to catch this one up, very fast. 

Another great thing is the length - usually ends up in 15-60 minutes. So during the evening you can play several games.

Don't have any expansion currently.

Funciona muy bien a dos al menos la partida introductoria, que era la intención cuando compramos el juego. Se explica rápidamente y el juego es un buen reto para los jugadores.

Lo único que se le puede achacar es que seguramente con más jugadores a parte de más complejo adolecerá de lider que juegue con todos... ya veremos.

Por el momento merece el 8, veremos como aguanta la partida de 4...

Jugado a 4 y nos pegó dos palizas en 20 minutos (jajaj), total pasamos a otra cosa. Por que estaba claro que no íbamos a curar ni un resfriao XD

No es un juego que nos llame mucho a jugarlo. Pero cuando lo hacemos nos mantiene en tensión durante todo el juego. Es el primer y único juego cooperativo de tablero que hemos jugado y vale la pena hacerlo. Creo que está excelentemente pensado.

Edito: La propagación de las enfermedades está perfectamente lograda. Y la tensión va en aumento. Cuando ganamos, siempre es de manera muy ajustada. Quizás lo que menos me gusta es que al principio uno mueve su personaje medio a la deriva (es una sensación mía) hasta que comienza a ponerse fea la cosa.

Now played twice in 4-player easy mode both times without the Researcher. Lost once when we ran out of player cards and won on the last possible turn (again we'd have run out of cards).

I suspect the Scientist is the weak link in the chain in a 4-player game. We found trading cards between players cumbersome and the one card cure advantage meaningless given the luck of the draw.

this is an okay game ... try to stamp out diseases before they over-run the planet, this is strictly a co-operative game, and thereby can be a danger -- the danger is this game plays via committee -- and I hate committees (having had enough of them in real life) ... the strongest tends to take over, and if you are easy-going, you find your moves, are not really 'your moves' .. go here; do this; no, no, WE think you should be over here; -- and so you go for the betterment of the species -- game can be challenging though, as disease spreads faster than the group can stamp it out; so this is good -- but your unique character becomes subsumed to the will of 'the committee' ... and you just knew your own move was the right one after all -- can be fun with the right group, but painful if not the right group -- seeing as co-op games are not my favs -- let me go and make my mistakes (and my total hate of all committees) .. although I would play this if tabled -- tis far from my first choice -- but it is an okay game

This was the first co-op game that I have played.  Picked the game up randomly and played a 2P game with the GF.  We lost miserably the first game but decided to play again immediately.  

The game is a little abstract with the cubes representing diseases (could have used different bacterial strain pieces instead IMHO), but it captures the urgency of racing against time trying to save humanity.  Players must coordinate and balance between containing outbreaks and finding cures for the 4 diseases before time (card deck) runs out.  

Everyone that I have introduced this game to has enjoyed it and usually ask to play it again.  If you like cooperative games, this one is well worth a try.  You can usually find a copy at your local Target.

I've been hearing about this game non-stop since I got interested in board games. I held off a long time because I simply didn't like Forbidden Island and such, so it was never really high on my list. Found the game on sale, bought it and damn... this is a good game. Never seen my group work that well together than when trying to plan out the turns here. Very good game. I can see that there could be some issues with alpha gamers, but we had no such issues. This made me decide to definitely get Pandemic Legacy next.

Okay, I love Coop and I extremely dislike this game.  Yes, I've read the fifty billion geeklists about how awesome this game is, I just can't get into the theme.  There is nothing fun to me about watching the world get infected with viruses.  I've given it a few playthroughs and I feel I've been a good sport about it.  Now it's just understood in my gaming group that you play this one when I'm not at the table.

Save the world, or die trying over and over again. One of the few co-op games I'm a fan of. Excellent strategic fun for two, although with four it can get tough to have everyone making their own decisions, as one under utilized turn will lose the game for everyone. I will continue to play this with two and an occasional four player game, although it would be better with experienced players. Never tried the terrorist variant, although the game is hard enough as it is. Stay away from Legacy, it just doesn't hold up to the original. Iberia seems to hold the feel of the original game with enough changes to make it uniquely interesting.

60-90m, 2-4 players. 25+ plays.

Interesting game, but the theme is a bit blah and abstracted.  It's hard to get excited to play this game, even though I have respect for its design.

Likely to go up.  After one play, we had a lot of fun.  It takes a lot of time to get through the rules the first time.  It is also a little hard to really see the strategy at first.  We just desided to start moving without trying to over-think it.  All things considered, (one of us is only seven), we did fairly well finding three of the four cures.  Everyone wants to play again.  Also, I love the non-glare finish on the board.  Although, as others have noted, the pawns are a little over-sized and/or the cities undersized.  Once you get into the game, it can be hard to locate the city buried under pawns, research centers, and cubes.

One of the first modern board games I played and one of the reasons I started getting into this hobby. As I play more I've come to realize that open information, shared goal co-op games are not my favorite. Playing solo or with one other person can be good, but not as much with 3 or 4 players. It will be rare for me to rate this type of game higher than a 7 unless my preferences or situation changes.

The mother of all coop games? This game just works. Everyone playing feels involved at all times, the mechanics are perfectly tested, the different powers for the characters are a plus, the theme is engaging for almost everyone I know and it is hard to beat, but not so that you never want to play it. With the right combination of characters and the right group, you could beat this game with no problems. So it's just a matter of luck at the beginning and then planning a good strategy. Amazing game.

This has the potential to be my favorite co-op game, a genre that I really enjoy (I have really enjoyed Ghost Stories as well as the classic in the genre, Lord of the Rings). First impressions are highly favorable and I am looking forward to more plays.

This is my revised comments on Pandemic:  The co-op genre has changed quite a bit over the year. If there is one place that I would recommend someone to start, it's here.  Pandemic is probably one of the best games for couples out there being a co-op, as regular life with a significant other can sometimes be confrontational enough as it is without adding 'take that'/competitive games to heat things up.  In addition to that, this game is very easy to learn and not overly long which makes it a perfect gateway game.  Co-ops of the modern day need a way to scale the difficulty levels and Pandemic is one of the best in this regard.  I had initially rated this game a 6 because it lacked the variety to hold my interest and while I still feel this way about the base game, On the Brink has transformed the game to something much more enjoyable and variable.  In addition to that, after having played some other co-ops, I have a much deeper appreciation for the game, even in it's base form. Though, I would never play without the extra roles/events of 'On the Brink.' 

I would rate this higher with the inclusion of at least one expansion. If you're not going to invest in an expansion, you're better off with buying Pandemic Iberia (7 Roles, 15 Events, and included variants).

7 Roles (5 in the old editions)

A great co-op game where you and your friends are trying to eradicate the four main diseases of the world.  While it is a simple premise it is very difficult to win depending on how many epidemic cards you put in your deck.  The spread is semi predictable, but you never know when it will happen and you are always on your toes to see if you will survive until the next round.  Really fun and intense.  This is definitely going to get some plays with small groups.

After all the hype and the fun of the computer game... it just seemed pretty dull as a co-op game? It is fun and I think it would be good as a 1 player game, but then you can use the computer.

RATING: 5.5
Initial rating of 7, but after a dozen or so plays, I've realised this is effectively a solitaire game designed for multiple players and would therefore recommend we all play something else, like perhaps...Pandemic Legacy or Pandemic Iberia.  And for solitaire, this game seems a bit like the VP States of Siege series, but I prefer those with their chrome, history and luck.  So while co-op games are intriguing, selling this version of Pandemic was a decision in which I have zero regret.  Worth a go though if you've never tried it as it's a great theme and I did enjoy several plays of it.

RATING: 5.33
Easy to learn, attractive components, but lacking in interesting strategy decisions.  Luck sometimes overshadows skill - the game should come with a built in system to warn players when no conceivable combination of plays can prevent defeat.  Sometimes you just can't win no matter what you do; other games will be won even with mediocre play; sometimes winning is possible only with good play.  The games of the first kind are frustrating and unsatisfactory because your time is wasted; games of the the second kind are boring because winning is too easy; only games of the third kind provide satisfaction by rewarding skillful play.  In all, I feel my time is better spent playing other games.  Rating based on three plays at the introductory level of difficulty and two plays at normal level of difficulty.  Rating of 5.33 is composite of my rating (4), my wife's rating (6) and my sister's rating (6).

RATING: 6
My first, and for a while my favorite cooperative game. Its incredibly prone to quarterbacking, but generally I've always felt like part of a team.  My biggest grievance is that certain setups can make the game impossible, in a literal way. Its not like that happens often at all (maybe once ever), but the possibility turns me off. Over the years they have added new roles with new mechanisms, but certain roles clearly trump others. Granted, this offers additional challenge on top of game variance, but I rarely view it from that perspective. Also, since the release of the Legacy edition, I will likely never play the base game ever again.

Easily the most popular cooperative game I own. Everyone wants to play it when I show the plastic cubes, and one game is usually enough to prompt an immediate second game after the first loss. Easy to engage all the players - in fact, you simply cannot win if you don't. I can be an alpha gamer at times, but I really enjoy pushing others to take some initiative. Can make a group of nerds sitting around the table into an elite team... at least, it is the best game I own at emulating that feeling.

It's probably better for experienced players to play together or a group to learn together, but when an experienced player tries to teach new players the new players will get very self-conscious about making the "wrong" moves because of the puzzly nature of the game.

Great cooperative game.  There is a real tension to this game and the theme is just a lot of fun.  There is something about seeing a break out of little red cubes spreading throughout the board and the look of desperation on players faces.

Great co-op game.  I really enjoy this game a lot, it is great as a co-op with friends or as a solo game.  Customization in your difficulty levels helps find the challenge that is right for group.  Interesting decisions to make throughout the game, leads to some hot debates about what the right course of action should be.  There is a ton of replay value in the base game, with several expansions available to help keep it fresh over the years.

I had a great time playing this twice. This theme clicks very well with my career path. 

On a cooperative level, this game is the first I've played and I enjoyed it. A light discussion, move your pawn, and draw your cards. The game has good flow, good mechanics, and good art too. In the two games we did get smashed though (5 epidemic cards) so when I do beat this game I will feel that I've accomplished something.

My wife and I started our game collection with Forbidden Island. Forbidden Island plays very similarly to Pandemic (mostly because it's designed by the same person, if I'm not mistaken.)
FI is quick and easy to clean up. The game practically cleans itself up as you play. Pandemic is so similar, that we get the rules mixed up ALL of the time. I appreciate with what Pandemic has done for the gaming community by bringing new blood in, but sometimes I would rather just play FI. Still a cool game, but definitely not a favorite. Might change when playing with a full group. I've only played two player.

Update 2/28/14
Bumped score up to 8. Played the game with my wife and two others last night. LOTS of fun compared to just playing with two. Bought both expansions at a good price (mostly for the petri dishes and the cure vials,) looking forward to finally beat the game! Will continue to update.

Light co-op game that is easy to learn, but has some nice random and unpredictable mechanics that makes it very tense. I especially like the different roles and how they can interact with each other. You really have to talk with your partners to get things going and make  good use of their vital special abilities. Looking forward to play it with more players and more epidemics.

RATING: 6
This game is cleverly designed, plays smoothly, and has been a hit with a number of our friends.  That said, I was a little disappointed with it - it just doesn't have the depth of strategy that I was expecting.  I guess there's only so much challenge you can have without a real human opponent to test your wits against.  By "not enough challenge" I don't mean that we win all the time, but instead that loosing because the wrong cards came up and it became impossible isn't the same sort of enjoyment as loosing because you were outmanuevered by a craftier opponent.  

That said, I do enjoy playing well enough, as long as there are 3 or 4 players and the others are excited about it, so that is what this rating reflects.  2-player I would rather pass on.

The perfect theme for a co-operative, us-versus-the-board game, because there's no need for the rules to simulate an intelligent opponent who responds to what you do. The diseases just do their own thing with a mixture of predictability and randomness, and you have to respond.

Alas, my wife won't play it as she finds the theme too scary.

Probably my favourite of the games I've discovered so far. (I'm new to the hobby.)

Co-op games aren't meant to be beaten every time.

Pandemic's spirit is akin to Tetris, where you don't really expect to finish the game, but rather see how long you can hold out until the world collapses around you. You would need players that apply computational analysis to the characters and patterns of each play session in order to routinely defeat this board. Even then, the challenge differs with each random assortment of characters and disease-ridden cities.

Despite the rarity of completion, this is a title that will manage to entice less orderly-minds to wade into the struggle for a plague-free world again and again.

Co-op games are interesting.  As long as the group doesn't allow one player to dominate all the decision making then it is enjoyable where each player can still have some individuality.  

The fewer the players, the easier the game is.  With 2 players, we have won with all 6 epidemics in the deck.  With 4 players, we have only won with 4 epidemics in the deck.

Edit:  This is a very good game and is such a mixed bag.  Sometimes with two players it is much easier, sometimes much harder.  Depends on the pair of Roles you receive and the initial infection plus Epidemic rate.

Too bad the second run changed the back of the cards and the conversion kit is needed.

[b][thread=469324]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "Pandemic"[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]16[/b] plays) One of the few games I have played that consistently creates an atmosphere of genuine tension. A great cooperative experience with a refreshingly [i]different[/i] and well-implemented theme. A common criticism is that if one person orders everyone else around for the entire game, the overall fun level decreases, but that has not been a problem with any of the groups I have played with. [GAMEID=40849] expansion provides many ways to shake things up if the base game becomes too easy and/or familiar. This will [i]always[/i] have a place in my collection, as I can see myself playing it for many years, with many different types of people.

[b]Why this is in my Top Ten:[/b] While I had been exploring the wider world of board games for a while, Pandemic was the first game to get me really [i]excited[/i] about board gaming. The cooperative aspect was a complete revelation to me, and one of my fondest gaming memories is playing this for the first time with some of my closest friends. We played it five times before we finally beat it... on Easy. It was such a thrill.

[b]4 year verdict:[/b] I haven't played this nearly enough, due in part to my local gaming group not being that interested, but it remains something I would play at any time, especially with the expansion. It is getting major competition from [GAMEID=100901], though, which my semi-gaming relatives have embraced. I would say that Pandemic is the superior [i]game[/i], but Flash Point, with its lighter theme and increased randomness, just might be the superior [i]experience[/i] in a primarily social sitaution.

This game is the sweet spot of difficulty when it comes to cooperative board games. At its highest settings, this game is intensely difficult and nail-bitingly tense. Players absolutely must cooperate or there is no chance of success. And, of course, the expansion freshens it up nicely.

Edit: Having played it now dozens of times, I feel like Pandemic is too easy. A good group should always know what to do, leaving the only determinant whether the epidemic cards screw you over or not. It's still fun, but it lacks challenge.

Pandemic is a co-operative game that reminds you that you can't do everything you want to. Remember that the goal is not to eradicate four diseases but simply to cure them.

Even the 'easy' game provides a moderate challenge. It only makes the eventual victory more satisfying. The game rarely becomes so grueling that you stop having fun.

Elegant rules make for a quickly-taught cooperative game that is always interesting as the players learn how to improve strategies as they identify patterns in the game. Great theme too.

I am interested in experimenting with a few house rules so that whoever has the turn initiates the conversations about what to do, in order to avoid dominant players directing everyone else's moves.

Pandemic seemed to be a breakthrough co-op game that definitely delivered.........the first couple games. After players figure out how to beat the game, the gameplay becomes much more predictable and scripted. You have to accomplish certain things every time and as quickly as possible. Also, this game is one of the most Alpha player games ive ever played and this destroys the experience for new players. There will be one experienced player giving advice because the other players simply have never played and don't know where to start. What ends up happening is one alpha player basically playing for 4 and the other players essentially being more arms to move pieces and that's it. Its actually more fun if no advice is given and if a player makes a bad choice than too bad.

Cooperative game, comparable to Shadows Over Camelot (which is best for 4-7 players), this is good for 1-4 players.  Quick playtime, and also suitable as gateway game.  The interaction between roles is excellent.  The Operations Expert seems to be the weakest.  I like giving the diseases names: black = ebola or black plague; red = small pox or swine flu; blue = anthrax; yellow = typhoid.  May be worth editing the Operations Expert (as revised in expansion card - details [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/453298]here[/url]) to make this role as strong as the others.
NB: First edition owners can trade in their decks for a newer linen finished one, details [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/426134]here[/url].

This game is one of my favorites because of its simplicity but its difficulty. After 20 plays or so you might be able to beat it at hardest difficulty 70% of the time, but with the expansions I have yet to beat it at medium difficulty!

I like this game a good deal and find the stress it brings at times to be really fun. Winning because of good team decisions can feel great. Loosing as a group is a devastating feeling though and I think that aspect makes it stay on my shelf more than it should. Especially because it's often really hard to know where you went wrong in hindsight. Maybe this is just a qualm with full co-op games, but I feel like a good designer could mitigate this somewhat.

RATING: 9
My favorite cooperative game.  This has a great feel in which you really engage with the theme.  Unlike many coop games, you don't feel that you are always one step away from disaster -- although sometimes you are!  You really do have the sense that you are in control and that there is a good chance to win.  The teamwork element in this game is much better than any other coop game I have played.  And the balance... it's perfect.

This is a simple and fun co-op game, but it can easily degenerate into one person telling everyone else what to do if you're not careful. Whether this game is fun or not depends more on who you're playing with than most games.

RATING: 6
A landmark game that kick-started the cooperative game genre. Sure, I know there were some big names out there before this one came along, but this is the one that created a sensation and started a flurry of other designs. I played the game dozens of times (on table & online) and enjoyed it as a group puzzle, but I think other designs have surpassed it. For example, despite coming out several years before Pandemic, Knizia’s LOTR coop game gives players much more interesting decisions with their cards -- and thus a chance for individually creative contributions. 

Flash Point: Fire Rescue, in particular, offers a similar experience but with many maps to choose from and the ability to swap roles during the game. Other cooperative games give players more individual decisions than the group puzzle laid bare on the board here. 

At this point, I can’t say I’ve much interest in revisiting Pandemic but I’m happy to have played it as much as I did. I’d rather play Flash Point or some other type of cooperative game, preferably one that gives players more individual decisions such as LOTR TCG or Gears of War.

And then comes along Pandemic: Legacy and shoots up to #1 on BGG with raves from all my friends who’ve played it. Looks like I need to try that one.

This is another example of keeping a game around to eventually play with the kids.

Pandemic may have been the first hobby game we purchased, but it didn't get too many plays due to a number of well voiced issues.

It's still a good game for the right situation/set of players, which is another reason why it's still around.

New edition of classic co-op
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Credit where credit is due, long after the hype I have finally got around to playing Pandemic and I can objectively say, the hype was real, it is a solid co-op game.

Pandemic is a game that rewards over-analysis and collaborative thinking as you need to get things done, you need to get them done quickly and you need to get them efficiently, because if you allow small problems to snowball the shit coming off the fan hits pretty quickly.  Team-work is a must; find symbiotic relationships between the different roles to play most effectively as even then it won't be an easy, nor guaranteed win.

This is a nice escalation in the difficulty of Matt Leacock's work (Forbidden Island > Forbidden Desert > Pandemic).

The most I can say about Pandemic is that the board and components were made of high quality in the original edition.  The game itself plays like a dentist pulling teeth, only without the Novocain.  The more players added to the game rapidly decreases the ability to win, and the game has a serious 'quarterback' issue.

If you like to order people around to do what you think they should, then you should play this!  I'd always rather play Forbidden Island/Desert instead.

The kids like this one a lot. I am not a big fan of cooperative games and I think there is a tad too much luck involved for my tastes.  Not a bad game, but one I won't generally pick to play and if the kids suggest it, I usually try to steer them to something I find a little more palatable (but being a sucker, I'll play if they bat their baby blues at me).

 I do have some gripes: The wooden components look like they were thrown in because they were cheap, as they are much too big to fit on the board. I don't think that the roles are terribly well balanced, as the Medic seems to be just about essential. 
 That said, for the time it takes to play I don't know of a finer cooperative game.

I wasn't into board games until I picked up a copy of this via the recommendation of a friend. It's more puzzle than game, which makes it unique. The co-operative nature of the game makes it more appealing to those who may not be interested in a standard, confrontational game. Everyone works together to strategize a plan to literally beat the board.Looking forward to purchasing the expansion.

This used to be a 10 until we got good at it. The expansion bumps the score up but the base game is played out now. There's no reason to play without at least the new roles. Pandemic suffers a lot from 'co-op syndrome' where the most experienced players essentially take over.

I have rarely come across a game that I wanted to buy after only one play.  This is the exception to that rule.  Pandemic is that rare game where the players play as a team against the actual game.  It is also that rare game that is fun to play with 2, 3 or 4 players - and can be equally challenging, frustrating, fun, and devilishly clever all at the same time.

RATING: 4
Very overrated game. Glorified solitaire except with your buddies. The expansions do improve the game a little. In co-op games like Arkham Horror, you at least have a character card with adjustable stats and there are enough things going on in the game that having additional players makes sense. With Pandemic, you just have some blah ability that you will probably spam for most of the game. There is no character development, story or boss to fight, just some diseases that don't seem to go away until the very end if you're lucky. I can see how it would be fun to explore different role combinations, but if I'm going to to that, I'd rather do it in a game that isn't reduced to a bunch of cube pushing.

I love the coop approach, which it makes it great to play with my 9 year old. By the second play through he was making real strategic contributions. The time we won the game on the last possible turn was one of the most thrilling gaming moments I can remember. It does a good job of ratcheting up the suspense, quickly moving from leisurely to frantic with a couple of turns of the cards.

The board game snob in me doesn't want to like Pandemic because regular stores are starting to sell it. LOL! But Pandemic is so well-known for a reason--it is intense fun for the whole family.

I'm rating it with it because that is how we always play it.

Played once so far with my wife and son.  We managed to pull off a win -- sort of.  I think we miscounted outbreaks and should have lost.  Also, I forgot that you can only cure a disease when you're at a research center, which probably would have cost us a few more turns if we'd played it correctly.  In spite of that, it was still pretty close -- black, red, and blue all had outbreaks and rampant infestation everywhere, black in particular.  Researcher was really useful, Operations less so, and I never even used my Dispatcher role.

At first I was attracted to the game because of its theme but after a couple of plays I found the theme thin in the extreme. It ends up being a mere number crunching exercise. If you have a great team you'll win, if you don't you'll lose. When any one player is not fully engaged and coming up with any great moves you can actually hear the sound of the grim reaper slowly sharpening his sickle. It's a fun gateway game for new players but agony for those who have ridden the train too many times before.

Guilty as charged - another co-op game that I am fond of.

Great components with a vibrant board along with great looking cards.  I enjoy the co-op aspect where you can play with yourself, another person, or a small group.  You can even play along with younger ones and teach them the game rather than a head to head type game.  The variable difficulty allows you to really challenge yourself if that is what you want to do.

In my experience, I view this as the most difficult co-op game out there where you should not be ashamed of getting beat because it really can be difficult.  While I consider it the most difficult, I also consider it the most well designed co-op out there.

A more challenging version of Forbidden Island.

Pandemic is an outstanding puzzle co-op, with a ton of variety added with the excellent expansions.  It's a classic game, on a lot of peoples' top ten lists for a reason.  Easy enough to explain to new gamers, but engaging enough to keep me coming back to it over and over again.  I've logged many more plays of the base game in the app, and always find it a great time.  Nothing beats the physical components though - the sense of desperation when you get a chain outbreak and have to place those little cubes out on the board is just great.

I love cooperative games, and this is one of the best. I find it very hard, as do many others, but rewarding when you get it right. Unfortunately due to the difficulty, usually one person ends up being the leader and helps figure out what everyone else should do, which takes away from the fun a bit. YMMV with that issue depending on the group you have. Good intro game for newbies.

I used to love this game a lot more before I started playing it too much to show several groups of friends how board game can be fun!

They loved it... then wanted to play again, and again and again. People in general don't like to play new game and prefer to stick to things they know already, which is probably why people still love monopoly. Beware of when they know this game! 

Positive :
  -Clean mechanics and rules
  -Very simple to teach
  -Relatively quick
  -Cooperation game
  -Difficulty lvl is adjustable
  -You can add themes and giggles by choosing what the diseases are. 
Negative :
  -Can be too simple
  -Gets old fast if you play too much (The game gets better when you add more expansion though.)
  -Frustrating to play with 'alpha players'
  -Frustrating to play with 'bad players'
also very boring to play alone compare to other coop games.

Nice little co-operative game where your each have a special ability, some are better than others but you can usually win this if you can work together.

Has a nice scaling method- add more or less epidemic cards dependant upon how difficult you want the game to be.

Having played the pandemic-survival event at my FLGS I think this is the only way I would want to play pandemic going forward. Its a FANTASTIC experience.

I find this game different every time based on the deck and when things come up.  I love the tension in the game and how I really feel the world is depending on me.  I think this game is harder to teach to non-games/new gamers than Flashpoint because in Pandemic the theme and actions you take (use cards to fly) is less intuitive and more abstract.  I find the roles do not specialize your characters much and on most turns your role does not dictate/suggest what your actions should be.  I find this can sometimes lead to people telling other what to do because there are a lot of options for new players.

My first game seemed to go very easily, until a forgotten rule was recalled - you can only make the cure in a lab. D'oh! That makes it harder and we didn't have time to start over, so we really want to give this another go. Very interesting game design, proper choices, a hard game system to beat and a genuine feeling of watching the diseases reach dangerous levels before your eyes. I moved this up to Love To Have on my wishlist, a definite buy. *** Played again properly, WE LOST BY ONE CARD! We should have used the 4th player more towards getting the last cure, instead of hovering up. But that may have caused an outbreak.... oh the humanity. *** Played again with new people, won the Intro game easily, played the normal game, lost badly. Oh the disease. Definitely want my own copy now. *** Played again and this time using all the rules correctly. Originally, I put the shuffled discards to the bottom of the deck. This results in cubes spreading everywhere. The real rules are actually correct, a small set of infected cities keeps pushing disease into outbreaks, making it much more realistic. We won too, only just! *** Played again with the proper rules, as a 3player game we lost badly early to massive outbreaks. I'm inclined to not play this as a 3player game, it seemd too hard. But we did waste too much time trying to clear a cured disease. Hmmmm, needs thought.

Great co-op game, with pretty high initial replayability because players will keep losing (even on easy, this is a fairly difficult game - at hard, I've yet to win any), and want to play again until they beat it.

And while it's recommended to hide your hand in an attempt to mimic communication difficulties in the real world, it's hard enough as it is to win already, so playing open hands may be wise until people get a good grasp of the game. A possible problem that arises with the latter is that one or two people ultimately become the tacticians, and end up leading the rest of the party.

I've only ever played the cardboard game once – the first time I ever played the game at all – but I've since played it many, many times on the app.
That first game was quarterbacked pretty hard by another player, which was frustrating but is clearly a risk. When playing a few games of Pandemic Legacy years later with other, equally-proficient players, we enjoyed more consultation and cooperation but even then there was a bit of that going on. It's clearly a great, classic game, but it's notable to me that after playing the app somewhat compulsively for a while, I haven't touched it since.

I've decided I don't like co-op as much as I'd thought. While skill and cooperation can certainly help you do well while playing this game, "breaking the game's code", is much more beneficial. Other people we've introduced the game to enjoyed it, as did my wife. For me, it's a calculation exercise.

Fine component production. Very nicely laid out rules. Solid gameplay. In terms of objective quality, if such a thing actually existed, I'd rate this game a 8. In terms of my desire to play this game again, I'd rate this game a 3 or 4.

RATING: 8.5
My personal favorite co-operative game, Pandemic has you playing the role of one of five distinct international medical specialist, whose job is to work with between one and three other specialists to find the cures for four deadly and infectious diseases before they overrun the planet.  This game has just the right mixture of simplicity, co-operation, variety, and tension that gives it near infinite replayability.  While a pretty simple game to get the hang of, it is still incredibly difficult to win at times, and the mounting tension in some games can be pretty intense, so the game can certainly be intimidating.  That said, this is one game I keep coming back to, and provided you play with people who like to work together with others towards a common good, you will love this game.  The apocalyptic biological plague theme, while not laid thick, works very well with mechanics.  Highly recommended, as is the wonderful expansion.

I take this on holiday. Perfect as a solo game, perfect as a 2 player game. Not sure above that though. I also love the expandability of it, not just with On The Brink, which is equally great, but also with Jack (The Warp) Reda's excellent expansions.

This is the game I wish I had invented!

Have reduced from a 10, only because other games appear more attractive now after so many plays.

Played 20+ times with 1-4 players.
Ratings history: 6|8|8|8|8........|10......

[b]Sharp looking co-op about saving the world from deadly diseases. It presents a challenging, ever-shifting puzzle to the players. I own this and expect to keep the game in my collection.
PROS:[/b]
- easy to learn, tricky to master
- variable, shifting puzzle
- variety of player roles (special abilities)
- well-designed modular expansions are available for purchase
- very attractive graphic design (I even prefer the plastic cubes)
[b]CONS:[/b]
- as much of a puzzle as a game (but I like this)
- could feel samey from play to play for some people (but I enjoy the shifting challenge)
- most gamers will probably need an expansion to keep this fresh (but game + expansion ~=~ $ of good strategy game)
- has "alpha" problem common to co-ops (but I let newbs do their thing)

:star::star::star::star::star: - My rating. 
:star::star::star::star::nostar: - Partner's rating.

1st play: Huh. Well, it is a good piece of design, but I didn't find it that fun. It was just a puzzle with shifting parts. I wasn't at all impressed by it. I prefer Shadows Over Camelot a bit more, and Terra and Lord of the Rings co-op a LOT more.

5 plays in: I like this a lot more than I used to. Really want the expansion.

12 plays in: I bought an expansion and am enjoying this game more than ever before, even without having added the expansion.

15 plays in: Good official solitaire variant.

20 plays in, and I have to say how impressed I am with the skeleton of the game. It is just so clever. The Infecting and Intensifying mechanics are brilliant, the asymmetrical links on the map (Santiago...grrrr). The outbreak mechanics, the decisions to make card passing difficult (and more thematic!). Multi-use cards, a variety of player roles... All of this for an incredibly reasonable price.

Quality game.  Excellent rule book & the rules are uncomplicated and straight forward.  Played the novice game with 4.  We came within a turn of winning, but lost to the board game. Play intriguing and want to play again soon.  The theme of the game is pertinent to the play and mechanics of the game. No score.  You either as a group, win or lose.

10/12/10  Next up was Pandemic. Played with 5 epidemics and got killed. Only 2 cures found. No yellow diseases to start meant the rest were hit HARD.

11/24/10  @mleacock Any word on a 2nd expansion for Pandemic?  Any chance a pharmacist could be included? (I once got an emergency call from the CDC!)

12/8/10  @mischakrilov Pandemic is my most played game the past couple of years. I'm not sure about the extended stats. I've been using friendless'.

The game that ruined all the others.  My wife generally only wants to play this one since we bought it.  I do get a little tired of playing it so exclusively, but it is a great challenge.  I don't like it as a game group game though.  Very addictive on heroic level.  I have the 1st edition, which I think is harder than the newer editions with the extra roles.

This plays great as a solo.  Use the roles well, they will help you.

Works better with fewer players since it is not as long between turns.

Had a chance to play Pandemic Survival at Gaming Hoopla 2017.  Wow, that was a blast.  I want to do that again.  It was so much fun to try and beat other the other teams and then find out we were way behind :)  with 2 teams getting all cures when we only had 2!

Beautiful components and exciting game to play.  I love how the theme shines through.  Can be played solo too.  We were a little confused at first at what a Cure did for the players but by the second game it made more sense.

Combined with it's quick playing times, and often close finishes, this game is often a "repeat play".

In the past, for the few games we won, it always happened very early in the game.  However, we actually had a few games where we won just one turn before it would have been over.

RATING: 9
After almost a dozen plays, we still have yet to beat it on Introductory level. We have, however, won our first game of Pandemic Legacy. We'll see how that changes going forward. The big lesson learned, from Legacy and playing on the iPad, is that outbreaks seem to be our weakness, and controlling them is more key than I thought it was.

Pandemic is probably the most straight-forward and least complicated co-operative game we own (with the obvious exception of Forbidden Island), making it our game of choice when introducing friends to the co-op genre.

We own the first expansion, but we haven't tried any of the variants contained therein, and I doubt we'll be adding any of the other expansions, for a couple of reasons:

1) We own the 1st edition, so we'd have to buy the compatibility packs; and

2) With Pandemic Legacy out now, regular ol' Pandemic may be about to become obsolete, at least in our house. We'll still keep it, though, for newer players and to combine with the Bio-Terrorist challenge in On The Brink.

Still one of the best co-ops I've ever played. I have introduced a couple friends to this and seen them go through the "Pandemic is the best game ever!" phase. Sadly, without the expansions the game can start to feel repetitive after ten or so plays.

RATING: 8.25
This cooperative game is very tense, exciting and fun. There is the issue of one experienced player telling the others what to do, but that I imagine is true of all co-op games. This one nearly always comes down to the wire, and often it's a matter of needing one more turn, or "if the turn order was just a little different." Virtually every game I've played has been a nail biter, and I always have a good time.

Update:  This has been a great 2 player game for me, many, many, plays. It's easy to misplay a rule or two and get an incorrect impression of the game.  Repeated plays have earned this game a 9, and with the extra roles in the expansion I consider it a 10.



Really a great game to introduce friends to boardgaming.  Short and tense!  The theme is great and makes you feel like a character from a Michael Crichton novel trying to save mankind from diseases.  It's a game you can have the folks from up the street try out without having them be an elf or an orc- the scientific theme is refreshing.  I hope the success of this game gets us more short cooperative games.  As a gamer I prefer Lord of the Rings as a cooperative because it feels bigger and has more decisions as well as more options as you play.  Pandemic is so short and lean that how the deck is stacked might determine the game before it starts.  Enjoyable and easy, I need to play more to see if it gets better for me.

Initial rating after 2 plays (8.75). This is a really great game. I love the theme and the gameplay really matches the theme well. It's nice to have a fairly deep cooperative game that plays in 30-45 minutes. It is actually just as fun to lose as it is to win.

UPDATE: After 8 games I'm just about ready to give this a 10 and move it high up on my top 10 list, but I'm going to wait until I play a couple more time. Excellent game. 

UPDATE: OK, after a few more plays I'm giving this a 10 and putting it in my top 10. I expected to like the game because the theme and gameplay sounded interesting, but Pandemic has far exceeded my expectations.

My fiance and I play this together (online for while he is long distance) to work on our cooperation and communication skills, heh. 

Only problem with this game is: you can only play with people as familiar/unfamiliar as the game as you are, otherwise a lot of bossing around happens. Also while there is some general strategy involved, this is more of a logistics planning game. Works great, but not as satisfying to me as an economic game.

Over familiarity has robbed this of some of the strength it once has - my girlfriend enjoys playing it a lot more than I do, and sometimes it feels like decisions can stretch out and the game doesn't have momentum.  I suppose I'm less invested in our success than I once was.  A good design, but I much prefer co-op games where the players have more distinct agency - Eldritch Horror, Defenders of the Realm, Flashpoint - and the 'right' move is less easy to be dictated.

My history with Pandemic is a common one.

This game (along with Settlers of Catan) was the catalyst to me becoming a board game enthusiast. It's a solid, well-constructed co-op and should stand the test of time as a classic.

With that said, the base game is a little lacking in my taste. Now that I own both the expansions and Pandemic Legacy, it's hard to go back to just the regular version. It feels like an amazing foundation with no house built on top of it.

Ultimately, if you like co-operative games, buy Pandemic. Then go and buy the first two expansions. Or just skip the whole lot and buy Pandemic Legacy.

This hasn't produced a boring game yet, though I have only played it a few times.  So far, everyone has liked it.  This is the best co-op I have played (in my limited experience).  I believe it is because no one ever has to "take one for the team".  That has caused tension for us in other co-ops.

I really like the mechanism wherein the infected cities are up for further infections after an epidemic.  This just ups the tension level, which is sustained throughout the game.

I think part of what makes this game work is he wide variation in player powers.  This helps give everyone a stake in what is going on, and a real role to play, since no one else on the team can duplicate the role nearly as effectively.

This was definitely a good purchase.

-------------------------
Update:

I am amazed at how close these games consistently are. Having played this nearly 20 times now, games are nearly always close.  This is just a great game.

I enjoy playing the game, but I find it stressful to either not be able to help other players or if I do help others to not feel like I'm dictating the whole game. Either way I don't like the tension I get from playing, but will usually play it when given the chance.

I really like this game. I've gotten several people to play with no complaints. Unfortunately after playing several times it is much easier to beat and I am not finding enough challenge in it. Even the expansion doesn't seem to make it too difficult. You do lose occasionally if the game play works out to put you in a losing situation. I have played with more players than the game was made for in the base set and it doesn't hurt the games mechanics to put 5 players in a 4 player game here.

I can’t stress this enough, Pandemic is a great game. It works thematically; it’s tense; there is little downtime as it’s cooperative and all players are contributing to a global strategy; it’s quick to play; and the rules iron out after two or three games. Out of the eight games played (in one evening) we’ve lost about half.

It's a challenging co-op. I really like the way epidemic cards work. Adjustable difficulty is always a plus too. However, I don't feel the need to play this too often. I'm sure expansions would help, but due to versions not being compatible, I'll likely never buy them.

Tense, quick, easy to learn.  And my non-gamer wife enjoys it!  What more can you ask for?   Moreover, I find this game vastly superior to the other co-op games like Shadows over Camelot and Lord of the Rings.  Those games are long and tend to get bogged down.  Outstanding game.

An excellent co-op game for just about anyone who likes a co-op. Easy to teach and easy to play.

The way the mechanics of the game, in particular the way cities get re-infected, perfectly match the theme of the game is something that you don't see that often. It is really well done and really quite clever.

Just remember to temper the controlling part of your nature and let new players make decisions for themselves. Enjoy the ride.

RATING: 7
Interesting "automatic game system", the outbreaks are neat and very thematic. Otherwise it's a relatively simple card game with a connection element. This one shares a problem of many coops: the information is (almost entirely) shared and therefore one person always tend to dominate the decision-making process. For some reason, I feel it more acutely here than in LotR. For me, Space Alert feels more novel due to the time pressure and the necessity to delegate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is excellent for playing with people that usually don't play a lot of games. Anyone can get into the theme and easily understand the goal of the game. It plays like a puzzle you have to solve. I often feel that the outcome of the game is decided with how the cards come up even if you can of course effect what will happen with your decisions. 

With On the Brink expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First cooperative game I really loved playing. It really does force players to cooperate and discuss options - when they don't, disaster usually results. Very nice balance of rules to create suspense and challenge throughout the game.

The only big negative to the game is that the initial conditions vary too widely - it is theoretically possible to lose within a few minutes and no chance to stop it. It is also possible to have a setup so easy that the group coasts to victory. For the majority of games that fall closer to the middle of these two extremes, this game is very enjoyable.

I love Pandemic. I love that it's a little puzzle-y; I love that its co-op. working together to beat the board is great. And it's a vicious board.
This is also one my wife will play, meaning it gets brought to the table fairly often, and easily. She also likes the co-op factor. The challenge and struggle in this game is great, and working together to overcome it is fantastic. 
Would be rated higher if Legacy and Iberia didn't exist.

This game is always a fun time.  The "On the Brink" expansion modules and variable difficulty keep the game fresh.  However, if you're not prepared to buy the "On the Brink" expansion immediately, don't pick this up.  The expansion is absolutely necessary in my opinion.

I should mention that I'm still playing with the older version that's not compatible with the newer expansions, so my experience with the game system as a whole is still partial.  That being said, the game is fun enough as is and I don't feel the need to add additional expansions at this time.

Az eddigi legjobb coop, amivel játszottam. Gyors, pörgős, így nem fáj annyira, hogy szinte reménytelenül nehéz.

Az a lényeg, hogy jelenleg van kihívás, és bármikor elő lehet kapni egy gyors partyra, a többi cooppal ellentétben.

Best cooperative game I know of. In fact, it's the only purely cooperative game that I know of. Most of the others are more properly called team games.

Nice coop with the right group. Very dominant players can easily turn it into a solitaire game, though. Unfortunately, winning or losing often depends on the epidemics drawn much more than on the players who can usually just try to micro-optimize their turns. Players have a very limited set of options, too, although some roles are more interesting than others.

Fun coop game, but for me it suffers from being so similar to Forbidden Island. I occasionally want to play Pandemic over Forbidden Island, but most of the time I prefer Forbidden Island because it is more streamlined and so much easier to set up.

Pandemic is tough to introduce to new people as well because the impact of your actions is difficult to gauge early in the game. Late in the game, even new players will recognize how important it is to remove those two cubes, but in the beginning it can feel meaningless.

Pandemic was my first coop-game. It was a pleasant surprise to play with my co-gamers instead of against them.

Pandemic's theme is great, it's fairly easy to explain the game to other players and it's a very addictive game. 

The difference between a win and a loss is very small and after each lost game you'll want to get in the game again and try to beat the system this time.

I'm looking forward to all the expansions (I've purchased the first one recently, just haven't had the chance to try is).

Oui, il y a le problème de celui qui dit toujours quoi faire et que les autres suivent, l'écoutant sans vraiment oser lui dire qu'il rend le jeu ennuyeux pour tout le monde. Bon, dans une équipe, il y a aussi souvent un leader, cela dit, mais souvent, s'il impose son point de vue, ça ne dure pas longtemps. C'est d'autant plus vrai si un des joueurs est vraiment meilleur que les autres. Pour contrer le phénomène, il suffit d'introduire des limites à la discussion, ne pas montrer ses cartes, que chacun bouge son pion au lieu que ce fameux joueur ne soit un "Répartiteur" permanent, et de s'exprimer si l'un des joueurs commence à trop prendre l'ascendant.

Il y a aussi la sensation de subir sans cesse le hasard du tirage de cartes qui détermine la victoire ou la défaite, l'impression de n'être pas loin et que finalement c'est le manque de chance qui a provoqué la défaite et la fin du monde. Et puis ceux qui n'aiment pas les jeux coopératifs et qui préfèrent taper sur d'autres joueurs plus réels.

Ça peut gêner.

Mais pour moi, c'est au contraire tout l'intérêt du jeu qui provoque un sentiment d'urgence, de course contre la montre qui est tout à fait adapté au thème de la contamination planétaire. On a vraiment le sentiment, en jouant, de faire partie de cette équipe qui doit enrayer une menace planétaire, on se sent presque à Hollywood (on commence à Atlanta, quand même). Mais à Hollywood, les américains arrivent toujours à sauver le monde. Dans "Pandémie", pas du tout. En fait, chez nous, on perd beaucoup plus souvent que l'on gagne. Parfois à pas grand chose, parfois à cause d'un mauvais tirage de cartes. A moins que ce soit nous qui ayons fait les mauvais choix, utilisé des cartes spéciales au mauvais moment, etc.

Car un jeu coopératif se doit d'être difficile. Un jeu "classique", lui, dépend des joueurs face à nous. Là, le joueur, c'est le jeu, donc s'il est nul, on gagne à chaque fois et ça n'a à peu près aucun intérêt et l'envie d'y revenir est presque nulle. Là, on a souvent l'impression qu'il manquait peu de choses, sans avoir vraiment l'impression d'avoir fait les mauvais choix et avec l'envie immédiate de prendre sa revanche.

Le plateau, lui, est assez sobre et avec peu de nuances, mais là encore, je trouve que l'esthétique générale ne colle pas mal au thème, on a l'impression d'être dans un QG de crise et de gérer la situation depuis ce bureau.

"Pandémie", malgré quelques défauts inhérents à ce type de jeu, est donc un excellent jeu coopératif avec un thème fort, équilibré malgré le côté aléatoire (mais maîtrisé et prévisible) du tirage des cartes : aux joueurs de réagir face à la situation.

Un succès amplement mérité.

This is fun to play, and doesnt take too much time either so useful as a filler game. Easy to alter the difficulty by adding/removing epidemic cards, and its very easy to learn how to play.

This game has gotten less enjoyable to me as time has gone on.  The difficulty varies wildly based on the shuffling of the cards, and is usually either too easy or nearly impossible.  Very seldom do we have a close call.  

Still good to play with more casual gamers, as the theme is inoffensive and easy to understand.  The cooperative nature of the game also helps out in this regard, but be careful of allowing a new player's moves to be dictated for them.

It's probably as good as a coop game would get.  I think I'm just not a huge fan of the genre.  One thing I think a coop game should have, though, is secret information for each player that cannot be shared with others.  That would force everyone to be an essential part of the game.  This game doesn't have that, but I don't really have any major complaints - it's complicated enough to require player interaction, great theme, great playtime, good bits, good interaction, and a good puzzle.  If I wanted a coop game, I think this is the one I would get.

Usually with co-op games I'm totally fine allowing everyone at the table to do what they think is best, and having the game live or die based on that.

We played a lot of Forbidden Island before trying Pandemic and that made learning Pandemic very easy. That said, we played a 3-player game with someone who had never played Forbidden Island and he caught on to Pandemic right away.

I amuse myself with how finicky my ratings can be based on recent plays. After seeing Mya rate this game a ten (and her only current ten in 1-11), it was on my mind when Willow came over for a game. We mixed in the virulent strain epidemics from 'On the Brink' and lost miserably in two games. I had written this game off as being too controlled by the person who knows what is going on, but when everyone knows the game, it really shines. I enjoyed it immensely, even though we lost miserably. It reminded me just how good this game can be and that, possibly, I had been playing too many teaching games.

This game is a marvel of board game design. Every detail of the gameplay has been well thought out.  The rules are easy to understand. The difficulty can be adapted to your play style. Each player has their own job to do and, because this is a collaborative effort, everyone remains fully engaged even when it is not their turn. 
Buy if you want an engrossing puzzle that you can (sometimes) solve with your friends

So far this is one of the best coop game I have played.

Pros:
- It's fast and easy to learn.
- The strategies are not too complex.
- For once, there is no treator. You all play toward the same goal. (This is great for people who dont like having a bad guy)
- Game play is fairly fast. If you loose one there is always the next one you can learn.
- It's fun.

Cons:
- You can't win them all. There is a fair part of luck in the success of the game. You can only accomplish so much with strategy.(I dont mind it but some people do)

Not without reason that it's a very popular game here on BGG. Play is quite smooth and tense, and teamwork really does pay off. No matter whether you win or lose, the tension alone will keep players alert and very much into the game. Not fun to play with overbearing people, although there are variants to solve that (but also make the game much harder).
Also quite nice as a solitaire game.

RATING: 8
I enjoy this game a bit more every time I play. That means about a dozen times, mostly two-player games and a few four-player ones.

This is a great game for casual players. It is one of the very few games where you don't have to explain the rules in detail and the others can catch up while you're playing. The theme is awesome, the mechanics are simple but fit very well.

The replayability seems to be pretty good so far as well. I was worried that I will lose interest in a few games. But the games and our overall strategies were pretty different so far, depending on our characters, player count and the cube distribution. Sure, there is a lot of randomness, but not so much that you don't have any real control over it. Or if it is actually the case, then the game hides that pretty well. However, I am a bit worried that maybe there are some general patterns I have not discovered yet and things could get really repetitive if I do.

One negative remark: The colors of the 2013 version are really dark for my taste. The cubes are nice, but I would prefer wooden components, sturdier cards and brighter colors.

But either way. This game is tough to win but easy to understand, is super interactive in a friendly way, and has an awesome theme with fitting mechanics. It's an incredible design.

Update: We have gotten really good at the game. So we tried it with the OTB expansion, but it has lost some of its charm even so. But anyway, it took us a far amount of plays to get here.

Brilliant design.

Always close games.

On the Brink doesn't add any new dimension to the gameplay.

Can be a bit bland after a large number of plays - the excitement has disappeared.

Followup comment: the In the Lab expansion changes this slightly - the new elements it brings to standard gameplay shake things up a little and reduce the reliance on having certain types of roles in your team for winning the game.

I appreciate the skill involved in the card counting, and identifying key diseases to put resources into curing versus those one waits to align, but that hardly excuses the game's total inability to deal with the alpha player problem.
Further I find the spread of diseases to be excruciatingly boring as every card flipped adds one cube to one place. It lacks any kind of meaningful texture and results in a game as clinical as its theme.

A clever co-op, puzzle game.  Plays equally well with 1 or 4.  I like the theme and the production is fantastic.  The rule set is easy to remember and the combination of special skills keeps the game fresh.  I still find this game to be difficult and I haven't been able to figure out some optimal strategy like others here have.  Easy to teach and it is great for non-gamers and gamers like.

EDIT:  Obsoleted by the combo of Forbidden Island and Defenders of the Realm.  The longer you play this one, the more it feels like a puzzle.

Following the Geek rating guidelines--which are like, SUPER important--I have to rate this a 2.  Just no reason for me to play this anymore.

--------------------

Cool game.  Played it with 4 epidemics   2 players...way too easy, we beat the game without breaking a sweat.  And yes, we checked each and every rule during our game.  Will play with more players/epidemics to see if that doesn't liven things up a bit.  But with 2, it's easier than 5-player LOTR on 15, and by a long shot.

RATING: 8
Great Co-op game. Easy to learn, quick playing, but is not just light and fluffy.  Has real decisions and can really end quickly and badly for all involved if you don't pay attention to what you are doing. Some people love the puzzle like feel to it. (If I do this, then you can do this, then she should do this). For me, personally, that aspect may keep this from getting an even higher rating from me. But I will still glady play any time and enjoy thoroughly

Played once many years ago, didnt like it.  Watch Table Top video of people enjoying themselves playing it, didnt like it.  There is something about this game that just hits me square in the "don't likes", much like eating calamari.  Rating 4, and don't really expect I will ever play again (Aug 2012). UPDATE: I still dont get the appeal.  Basically, the alpha gamer takes control, and it just seems like a puzzle solver than a game, or a computer game as a board game.  Would rather play the simpler Forbidden Island and let the kids take control (Rating 5.492, Dec 2015).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2-4 players, best with 4

Easy to learn, with a randomness to the gameplay that provides challenge and occasional insurmountable difficulty.  I'd probably place it mid-way between Forbidden Island and Elder Sign in terms of baked-in difficulty, Forbidden Island being a relative breeze and gateway gamer game, and Elder Sign often off-puttingly and punishingly difficult.  Unlike Elder Sign, a game loss is just as easily followed by a win, so it doesn't push players away.  Repeated plays may lead to the atrophy of interest with its relative sameness, but the Legacy series have pretty much killed the original anyway.  Play those instead, stay interested throughout the campaign with the ebbs, flows, and tweaks, as well as all the legacy bells & whistles.

Pandemic is pretty damn amazing.  Apart from the amazing components and immersive theme, there is such a high degree of player interaction in this game.  Because it's co-op, you get into rather deep discussions of strategy.  I'm truly amazed at how perfect the mechanics are, and how engaging this game could be for casual and die-hard game fans.  The average time for play is very suitable as well.  For a game without antagonistic competition, Pandemic is as much a nail-biter as any other well-designed game.

I needed a cooperative game in my collection and I'm glad I got this one. Is is simple, easy to teach, appealing theme and playable by anyone in the family. Fun family game with lots of interaction and nobody gets hurt in the process. You either win as a team or you will all loose. You can actually change the game difficulty by adding Epidemic cards. It gets really nasty and stressing when playing with a higher difficulty and that tells you that you get caught up with the theme.

Quick playing, and tense.  A strong cooperative outing with an interesting theme and quality production values.  The variant player powers offer interesting combinations and interactions.  The built in timer keeps the game at a short playtime, but the end ties in thematically, so never feels gamey.   

UPDATE:  With a couple more plays on heroic difficulty with three players this game shoots up in the rankings surpassing all other co-op games i have played.  Scales very well, and offers a very quick and tense experience.

UPDATE:  Pandemic is my co-op choice when I have less than an hour, but my enjoyment of this game has been surpassed by Defenders of the Realm.  Granted Defenders owes a lot to this marvelous title, but I find the experience for Defenders much more immersive.

I played it once and immediately bought my own copy and have played that more than one hundred times since, and I will still try to start games. The co-operative aspect is great: it has brought in players who are otherwise turned off by the competitiveness of boardgaming. The rules don't take too long to explain to a newcomer. The motif is brilliant for the mechanic, and fun and interesting. The play is interesting and the difficulty level can be adjusted to suit your game. The 5 different roles* make the game more interesting.

It is not without it's faults (although I don't consider any of these faults): particularly that the randomness of the card deck means that sometimes the game is much harder or a bit easier. It seems particularly well-suited to 3 player, although 2 and 4 are both fine (and I play more often in 2 or 4). There's no winner.


*Or 6: it's beneficial and easy to add the Generalist Role from the expansion (it just gives 5 actions per turn).

Pandemic er i mine øjne blandt de bedste samarbejdsspil. Et spil der som oftest er spændende fra start til slut. Går det helt galt, slutter spillet ofte hurtigt. Når man vinder er det selv de sidste ture inden det lykkes altid med en sikker forvisning om, at meget endnu kan nå at gå galt. Mekanisk er spillet meget elegant og som oftest præsenteres man for interessante valg. Skal jeg rette en kritik imod Pandemic vil det være, at det måske er en smule for abstrakt.

Epidemics are a$$holes.

Wasn't grabbed by this at all.  Neither game I played suffered from the "one player takes over" problem, so that was good.  However, I still felt like I was just going through the motions, and those were pretty limited based on my character's ability.

Update:  Considerably better this time, and decent with two players.  The expansion had a lot to do with that.

Great game. Theme and mechanics work wonderfully together. I can't recommend this game enough if you enjoy co-op games. If you don't like co-op you probably wont like it. If you don't work together you WILL NOT WIN. 

My only gripe is that the board/map should have had bigger city spaces to allow for cubes and pawns to be grouped more clearly. It still works but the obsessive/compulsive in me wants each cities "stuff" inside the city...

Excellent game. The one issue is that, as a cooperative game, it's prone to one person playing the leader. But I guess that comes with the territory.

It's beautiful how the disease outbreaks develop in this game. I was absolutely floored the first time I played as I watched the world get overrun (and so damn fast!) by a disease we didn't think was even overly-threatening.

The big problem with this game is that it tends to get played for you - there are obvious "best" moves to take, and since it's such a difficult game and you really do want to win experienced players have an incentive to try to tell you what to do. This kind of leads to one person taking charge and that can be dull for some folks, which is a shame, because experiencing that out of control outbreak is a one-of-a-kind moment.

Enjoyable us vs. system game.  It has too many times where you feel the outcome didn't depend on your skill (impossible to win, or impossible to lose), but the games where it comes down to the wire and clever play won the day makes up for the bad games.  Plays quick enough to make the bad games not really matter.

The game is so easy to teach and play. It is tense and animated. I like the outbreak mechanic. I also like how each combination of characters abilities make the game ever green. You can tweak the difficulty to your liking.
On the downside, (1) sometimes it can feel like cleaning the board of little glass cubes, rather than eradicating diseases. (2) I don't really understand how collecting city cards help you cure a disease, from a thematic stand point. (3) it can get very hard with 4 players, which is a shame, as it is only then that you get the full collaborative experience and synergies between characters. (4) the only mechanic to slow down alpha players is that you are not meant to show your cards, which arguably isn't really enough to stop those players. (5) Luck does play a big role in your success or failure. There is no morale choice to make, all choices are related to risk management.

I neither love nor hate Pandemic, however after several plays I've grown rather bored of it. Have recently played Pandemic: The Cure and while the main gameplay is mostly the same, it played in about a third of the time and didn't overstay its welcome.

CCCXXV :
One of the greatest cooperative games ever invented. With a unique mechanic to simulate the spread of disease all over the world, this game can be exciting, fun, frustrating and yet addictive all at the same time. Also, each player picks a different character with specific abilities at random which makes every game feels and plays differently.

First time I was so engaged in the coop. game. Maybe because of pure and elegant rules? Maybe the theme griped me? I donno'. The game was pure fun.
Need to check it on higher levels of difficulty.

On the other hand I'm worried about it's replayability. I hope there ain't no winning moves.

RATING: 7.9
Tried it twice so far, had a great time.  It is a fast cooperative game which is an A in my book.  Only criticisms so far are that some roles are more active than others, and that 'hive mind' strategies seem to be ideal.

Edit - played it several times recently, each more enjoyable than the last.  Previous criticism still applies, though I have more appreciation for the intensity of the game and the pace.

A very fun and entertaining light game. If you want to game with nongamers or just have a real light experience this would be my recommendation. A great group think game if you can avoid having one person play multiplayer solitaire. Perhaps the best gateway game I've come across. With all that said, it's waaaaaaay too light for me to want to get it to the table much.

The main thing that tarnishes Pandemic in my eyes is that, while I won't say solved, many moves are forced or obvious.  This makes it less a game and more a puzzle.  However, I do enjoy the fact that different role combinations and different number of players play differently.

RATING: 8
It might be a little too much of a co-operative game for my tastes, but I guess it just adds to the all-for-one atmosphere.  I'm starting to think it's impossible to win, but I think a lot of that is the element of luck involved in the drawing of cards.  I tend to like the fact that it's unpredictable, but I think some would dislike that.  Whatever...I'd rather have a game that's too hard than one that's too easy.

I think this game is almost played out for me.  Just won a five-player, six epidemic game fairly handily.  Still fun, but wouldn't be my first choice of a game at this point.

Taught a group of eleven year-olds this game and they absolutely loved it.  They really enjoyed the team aspect of it; they found the experience of working together in a board game very unique and different from what they were had previously experienced.

My intro to coop games. It's a decent enough experience, but... even when we win with one card left to draw, it still doesn't raise my blood pressure the way I'd like a game to do. Still, it's a nice team-building activity with the group.

RATING: 5
Early when I was starting my gaming collection, this seemed like it should be an auto include.  Everyone online loved it and said it was a great way to get people into gaming.

I was a bit disappointed with it.  My wife and I enjoyed it the first few times we played it, but after you know what to do, everything just becomes automatic and either it works out or it doesn't.  Sometimes the order of the cards is just too cruel and you cannot win, but often just doing the obvious things to do gets you there.

Pandemic also suffers from what I generally dislike in cooperative games.  The guy who owns the game and explains it to everyone knows how to win.  So he gets put in the awkward situation of telling everyone how to win or letting them fend for themselves and watch as the game implodes.  Neither option is very fun for me, and no one has ever played Pandemic with me and gone "Wow, that was a lot of fun!  Let's play again!".

My girlfriend and I love playing this together. It's usually pretty intense throughout the game, a lot of interaction with each other, very satisfying to win, but still fun if you lose. The game can change in the draw of a card. There have been times when we were in the best possible shape we could be in, and a single card lost us the game. So there is a luck factor, but if you've got solid tactics you'll be able to win often.




EDIT 5/22/12
After playing this a couple dozen times, it has been knocked back to an 8. It's still a great game, but the setting up is so cumbersome. And there's no quick way to do it. This coupled with a luck factor that can kill you off in the first few turns has eaten away at the fun factor of it all. The more we play it the more it starts to feel like a chore, the replay ability only reaches so far.

LUCKILY there is an expansion, so we've got it on our radar, hoping it will breathe some freshness into this once great game


EDIT 6/28/12
We got the 'On the Brink' expansion and love it. Adds lots of variety to the game. Plenty of new roles, new special event cards, even new game modes. We've been back to playing it semi-regularly, the expansion is pretty pricey but adds more fun if you're a fan.

Pandemic is such an enjoyable team patience, and it is so practical to play, that it continues to be first choice to fill an hour every so often. We find we manage to "save the world" with a good frequency for satisfaction - and it often is decided with the last few cards.

considered one of the best coop games out there, pandemic offers the kind of thing we mostly fear, the pandemy, maybe even worse when this pandemy is caused by 4 unknow pathogens who spreads very quckly through the world and for wich no cure has been yet discovered. players try to avoid the apocalypse(lot's of immagination is left there for the players immagining what kind of apocalypse could happen)using specialized people( like military medics or scientist and reserchers) trying to look for a cure while treating at the best of their skills and possibilities the sick people they will encounter in their trips. a game really enjoyable with all the numbers of players allowed, best with all 4

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game. I've only played it once and I would say you surely need to play with the right people. I can't stand co-op games where one person sits there and tells everyone else what they should do. I feel they could just go home and play the game by themselves. The game seems like a lot of fun and has a lot of potential, but really needs a certain crowd to be played with imo.

I would like to try this again to get a better feel of the game. It may take a few plays to get the hang of what is going on and how to go about certain situations that arize during gameplay.

Overall, it was fun and intrigued me enough to try it again. My rating may go up once I get this played a few more times.

After repeated plays, I'm not entirely sure how to feel about this game.
It's a lot of fun when we bring it out, and non-gamers can get into it. And I prefer the slightly deeper strategy of this game to the simpler Forbidden Island.
But I'm not really excited when we play it. It's missing the tension of Battlestar Galactica, or the great theme and hilarity of Space Alert. So I'm not sure how much longer this will be in my "great co-op" collection of games.

I LOVE this game, but now enjoy it most solo. First broke it out with an out of town friend visiting for the weekend, and we lost 12 games in a row, but loved every one. Then we realized we were not following one of the rules correctly, making a difficult game completely impossible. Following the rules means I can now win perhaps 60% of the time.

Rating based on 2-player only. The first few plays, we were overwhelmed with grueling decisions, working desperately just to tread water. Lost three games in a row.

A fun cooperative game that evokes its theme very well. I have played this with three different sets of players and every time the group wanted to play it again immediately. It has an uncanny knack of allowing you to get really close to winning...and then defeating you. In my first 6 games we won once on the easiest setup. In time it may become a bit repetitive, but by then I will have had my money's worth. Good value and recommended.

For a game I've played a billion times, I am pretty meh about it.  It's a fine diversion, and other gamers (and non-gamers) seem to LOVE the game.  But for me, it's just something I do and remain fairly unengaged with.  And it's another alpha dog, put out the fire, co-op.  I have trouble with these, as unless I keep very strict control of myself *I* can start to act like the alpha dog.

At this point I'll be honest, this is a great game I am utterly tired of which is why it is rated as low as it is.

RATING: 7.5
A very solid cooperative game. I like playing with two, more than that and it becomes a bit cluttered. With more than two you also run the risk of having too many ideas... Unfortunately the game seems like more of a puzzle than a game, so I have to be in the right mood for it. Definitely a game that can be played solo, although there are other things I'd rather do at that point.

RATING: 8
So much buzz over this game right now.  Surely this has been hyped up to such an extreme that people are destined to be disappointed.  Cooperative games are few and far between, let alone good ones.  Pandemic streamlines the genre to such an extent that it really feels unique.  Lord of the Rings is a great cooperative game, but it seems convoluted in comparison.  This is a game that really fights the players every step of the way, and you really feel the encroaching doom as diseases continue to spread across the globe.  The buzz is justified.

As for the components though, the production is just okay.  It looks just fine, but I wish a little more effort was spent some better components.  The game deserves it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great co-op game, with decent replay value. Once you've played it a lot it can get a bit easy, and some combinations of roles are quite a bit better than others. This is the game most likely to succumb to Follow-the-leader syndrome though so enjoyment will depend a lot on who you play with, and you have to be very careful introducing new players so that you don't just tell them what to do.

I find the game dull and lacking in engagement. Once you are playing the game well your decision-making ability is locked into just responding to the board condition with no reward for creative or innovative play. There is no risk/reward in the game that is of any consequence. Once you play the game well you are essentially watching things unfold to see if you win. Losing is often out of your control and, with experienced players, has nothing to do with the players, just luck.

Very good co-op game. It's a classic for a reason, it's has solid mechanisms and is quite challenging. The expansions add a lot of interesting elements as well. I think I slightly prefer Defenders of the Realm, which gives me more of a thematic-story feel, but really it copies so much from Pandemic that I have to give it the respect it deserves. If you're just getting in to co-ops, you'll find a LOT of other games in the genre have "borrowed" elements of this game. It's almost like "tower defense", but at just the right level.

First play for all 4 players.  We had to restart after two turns due to a major rules infraction. One of the very few cooperative games that I have enjoyed.  The group prevailed with one turn left before the blue card deck ran out.  The group looses the game if a player reaches for a blue card and the deck has expired, if the "diseases" have had an outbreak 8 times. And there is a third way for the game to beat the group but it escapes me now.

This is the game that turned my interest in boardgaming into an obsession. I didn't know games like this existed. It opened up so many doors and categories in my mind. And it's just a lot of fun. Every. Single. Time. I heard someone say it's more fun to lose in Pandemic than win in a lot of other games. I'd have to agree. One of my all-time favorites.

Also own On the Brink and In the Lab expansions.

This is my favorite co-op.  It's a great game to teach people who don't have much gaming experience.  Most people I've taugh it to enjoy it so much they immediately want to play again to try and beat the game.  

I like that it can be played different levels of difficulty.

Difficult game, but fun nonetheless especially for competitive people looking for a break from cut-throat gameplay (like myself), as long as there are no 'dictator' types should play very well, scales extremely well, varying difficulty levels are welcomed and its implementation is genious.

Own the base game and obviously think highly of it. A great concept and challenge and a ton of fun.

Will probably get the 2nd edition board at some point down the line just to have it in my collection, but it's not something I'm going to get right away.

RATING: 7
The genious of this cooperative game is that you have to keep your hand hidden.  This way, even the more timid players at the table, still get to talk.  "Well, do you have many cards of the same color?" "How many red cards do you have?" "Who has the most yellow cards?"  Placing the cards open ruins this, and you'll have one player dictating the show.

Oh, Pandemic. There are two phases of my life: pre and post-Pandemic. This was the game that started it all for us. My wife and I had been playing Monopoly and Yahtzee and one day in Target, I saw this (the original printing) on a shelf and wanted to give it a shot. We bought it and stayed up until 3am that night playing over and over until we beat it for the first time and oh how rewarding was the first sweet victory. While there are other games that are more fun or inventive, this game will always hold a special place in my heart as the one that opened my eyes to what games have become.

One of the best introductions to modern board gaming available. My roommates who don't game much love this, which I can't say for many other titles. The modern theme and co-op gameplay are totally on point. It gets worse the more you play it for sure, but as a starter game it can't be beat.

2-4 player co-op gateway game.  For Dad?
April 2008, ConVic 7 - first play. (actually played it 4 times.  Thrice 4-player, once 2-player.)  Giving it a 6 out of 10 as it is basically just a puzzler (especially in 2-player).  Enjoyable and somewhat tense, I see it becoming stale quite quickly as there is not a lot of variety (which a puzzler requires).  Biggest threat and way to 'solve' is usually fairly obvious. Whether one succeeds or not is likely to be decided by cards when enough experience is had.  Doesn't tell a story like Arkham Horror so, despite the theme, becomes a bit dry.  Casual gamers will likely get a lot more plays out of it. (removed from Wishlist)

Bought from Barnardo's charity shop in Brixton for £3.99, in November 2012. (Although we'd played my brother-in-law's copy plenty of times before that.)

One of my wife's favourite games, which helps me love it even more. This and [thing=98778][/thing] fill the co-op niche in my collection and I don't feel any desire to get more.

Pandemic creates tension like nothing else I've played. It plays fast, escalates fast, and if you start getting good at it you can always make it harder...

And you know what? As much as I love abstract games, theme [i]matters[/i]. Saving the world from a series of horrific disease outbreaks? Yes! Makes heroes of all of us!

This is a really good coop game that, along with the expansion, has provided many a fun game night. I'm beginning to wonder if the lustre will dull after repeated plays with the same game groups.

Terrific game!  There are a couple of things I'm not the fondest of, but the strategy is top notch, and it's great for casual gamers.  I'm somewhere in between Casual and Hardcore in that I've been getting more and more into "hardcore" boardgames; but everyone has a good time when I pull out Pandemic.  One of the best $25 purchases I've ever made!

RATING: 5
One of the better co-op games out there. Despite the board feeling like it was too small the first couple of plays, I feel it's the perfect size for it's function.
My board has warped a bit, but that's always a problem here simply because of the super-dry climate. Other than that, the components are top-notch, and the box is a nice compact, and portable size.

An excellent game for couples since there's no conflict, and it's one of those games that plays wonderfully with just two.

My biggest gripe with this game is the un-inspired artwork. It needs a fix, badly, as the look of the box turns most people off from it right away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Might almost be more fun as a true solitaire game. The only real downside of this exciting and well-balanced co-op game is that it tends to devolve into one or two players simply planning everything out and telling the others what to do.

I prefer co-op games that have traitor mechanics, to avoid the solitaire-by-committee phenomenon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
So... The game develops according to just your decisions, and yet it may be impossible to solve, no matter what decisions you take, just because of the way the cards are stacked? So, if I was trying to win, I was just wasting my time? Plus bland, unimmersive theme? Pass. 
I'd rather let the world die to colorful viruses in form of cubes.

Cooperative gameplay at its best. Adapts well to groups of different sizes. The mechanics are smart, direct, and malleable to different strategies. Relatively simple to teach to newcomers, and the difficulty can be increased or decreased to accommodate player experience levels. Games tend to play out organically, making no two games too much alike. Quality components.

Nearly a perfect game that is very challenging, but rewarding. Simple enough to teach to new players. Tons of replay value.

This is one of the best cooperative games I've played. It rewards good strategy and teamwork on the part of the players. We fell a hair short of winning the introductory game. In hindsight we identified an error in our approach, but the luck of the draw had something to do with it as well. The only thing I can complain about is that it only supports four players.

Just got this, played through a 2p game tonight to familiarize myself with the rules.  Wow!  The sheer amount of replayability and variety and choice in game setup is incredible.  I bought it with On the Brink for this very reason and I'm blown away at the quality and design of this game.  I can't wait to dig in.

UPDATE: played it 10 times now with 2p and 4p.  Great game.  Lots of variety between each game due to the randomized board layout, shuffle of the deck, etc.  Crumby roles combined with a crumby shuffle tend to result in a loss, but I'm willing to chalk that up to inexperience utilizing all of the roles effectively. Very happy with this purchase.

UPDATE: Haven't really added much from On the Brink.  Just roles and events.  And only attempted In the Lab once, but found it too much and decided there's still plenty of fun to be had in the base game for now, so we shelved that expansion and have been plugging away at more or less base Pandemic.  It's a great game and we'll be playing it for years and years.  There's no rush.  And it's nice to know that there's plenty of room to grow as we get used to the game.

UPDATE: We've added Virulent Strain Epidemics and it's adding some nice flavor to the game.  We win consistently with 5 epidemics but can't seem to win with 6 very often.  

The game is still fantastic and the perfect sweet spot for weight / duration on the nights when we want to play something but we don't have the energy left to do a multi-hour brain burner.  This is concentrated middle-weight thought in a 45 minute package.  Awesome in that regard. I upped it in points to reflect just how much we've been playing it lately.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
As a cooperative game with perfect information of other players' status and semi-predictable random events, it really encourages strong personalities to dominate the game, making the other players merely their agents. The game balance requires carefully coordinated planning - encouraging analytical or experienced players to make that problem worse with detailed "advice" for less experienced players. I'm pretty bad about that myself.

Most of the loss conditions don't really feel like "failures" within the theme of the game, which some people find annoying; others continually feel they were "so close" and keep trying. (Though often those games only feel "close" because of the theme, not in terms of game mechanics.)

There is a *LOT* of randomness in the initial shuffle, though by 1/4 of the way into the game half of the randomness gets pretty predictable. I'd estimate only ~10% of the shuffles are impossible to win, but many more might only be /likely/ to be won by someone with knowledge of the draw decks (in particular which cards will be unplayable since they are near the bottom of the player draw pile).

Pandemic was introduced to me by a friend and the cooperative nature really appealed to me. I almost instantly went out and purchased a copy. It plays excellently with two players but is also great with three or four. It can also be fun to play solo - I regularly play the iPhone/iPad app (generally with two characters) and love the challenge of saving the world on my own!

Our love of Pandemic also led to our purchase of Pandemic: Legacy which was some of the best fun we've ever had gaming.

I love Pandemic! The first game I bought when I started to seriously get into board games at the age of 40! It basically opened the door to a whole new world which I didn't know existed!

Marked down because (as everyone recognises) it can suffer from strong characters telling people how to play their turn!

Excellent cooperative game with realistic theme, low random chance and challenging game play.

Pros:
+ Theme is realistic and motivating to play (everyone wants to fight diseases),
+ Components are in good quality and they look good (I liked them),
+ Game is strategic, random chance is very low as I saw it,
+ The balance of mechanics in this game is outstanding - everything seems to be balanced,
+ The easiest level is challenging enough not to win game at the first play,
+ The game is really cooperative - cannot imagine how to win it without using qualities of co-operative play,
+ The playing time is very good (about an hour),
+ While playing there is no downtime at all - all players are involved in strategy to win this game,
+ I could not found any cons in this game itself.

I won only the third match from begining (at easiest level).

My husband loves this game, because its cooperative nature means i don't end up throwing pieces at him! I have also introduced this to many of my friends (some of whom are newbies to strategy games) and after a turn or two everyone really gets into it and we always have to play at least another game!

This is an exceptionally well crafted game. Just sitting back and watching the game system work is part of the joy of playing. The masterstroke is the way the discard pile gets shuffled and stacked on top of the deck at somewhat unpredictable intervals. That simple rule generates an amazing amount of paranoia.

With experienced players, I recommend playing with 5 epidemic cards and the infection rate boosted to start on the second space. Other ideas for increasing difficulty include (1) removing some cubes from one or two diseases, (2) requiring the eradication of one of the diseases (either a specific one or a freely-chosen one), or (3) adding the 6th epidemic card. Smaller player counts tend to make for easier games, so it's nice to have an arsenal of tweaks that can be added or subtracted.

If you want to play solo, you can of course simulate any number of players, but you can also try playing with just one character (preferably the Scientist or the Medic).

Pandemic is an excellent co-op game and is perfectly balanced. It is very challenging, but definitely winnable. It strikes an ideal balance between luck and predictability, and its mechanics work very well.

I've played it countless times but still enjoy it just as much as I did the first time I played it.

The On the Brink expansion also helps you diversify the gameplay a bit, and keeps it fresh.

I love the theme. I really feels like a race against time to eradicate nasty, flesh-eating, puking death before it consumes the world around you.
However- this game is a puzzle, and you have to play it cooperatively. That means it has two big strikes against it: 
1. Dominating players will end up telling you what to do.

2. They are frequently right.

There is usually "one best option" to take, and if you don't do it, or maybe you didn't see it at first, the game is OVER. 
It's just OVER, and it's suddenly your fault that Aunt Minnie in Chicago died on the toilet along with half the population of North America.

Similar to Castle Panic, Forbidden Desert, Defenders of the Realm, and other cooperative games -if you don't do the "next right thing," you're toast. Or in this case, a quivering, feces soiled, vomit-covered invalid who just lost the game for everyone because you wanted to take that flight to Buenos Aries to cure the black plague. Who knew the red Captain Tripps virus was about to break out in Moscow?
We knew, you moron. 
And you didn't listen to us.

Get out.

Okay, maybe we were harsh with you, but this game does create a real sense of tension, and when outbreaks occur you almost can hear the screaming humanity.
It's difficult to win, but early on, you will win a few times - mostly because you were playing it wrong.
That happens a lot. 
There are so many house rules for Pandemic, I'm sure Z-Man games is trying to come up with a vaccine for them. It can get a little "fiddly" especially if you forget your characters power, or don't follow the outbreak rules just right. Since it is very hard to win, I think that's where all the house rules pop up. This is often the first co-op game many new players experience, and the concept of losing as a team with the game lurching to sudden halt realy surprises them. Look at everyone's reaction on Will Wheaton's table top when they loose Pandemic. Look at Morgan Webb.  
Yes, let's do that for a while.
Mmmmm. Morgan Webb.

I'd like to buy the On the Brink expansion, but I just don't get to play this game enough to justify the expense. If this is the first game you use to expose your friends to co-operatives, then explain to them about the fun of playing without actually winning. 
It may go down as less of a bitter pill when they loose.

Rating after 3 plays-- great fun. Have to try not to be over-dominant in dicussions cause that makes it less fun for others. It feels quite exciting. I do think it's got a limited shelf life, though, so I expect the rating to go down after a few more plays.

10 plays in; game is still fresh and fun. Rating same.

Half the games have been 2 player; it's a bit harder (less special powers). This is a brilliant couples game; challenging, fun, and cooperative. My partner is addicted, and so far, there's no cure!

25+ plays, still enjoy it. Like it best with 2.

First impressions: The game is okay, it is hard to beat at the highest difficulty. I would not play just to have fun myself but to get people to try board games that differ from the basics... monopoly or catan.

Ten Plays: I respect this game more because it is one of the best games to introduce people to the idea that board games are FUN! Have used this wilh sister in law, sister, my girlfriends 12 year old brother (training him to be a serious opponent one day :)) The game is actually a lot of fun and I enjoy facilitating it to new people and seeing peoples thought processes - a great people watcher game! Even have the expansion as a potential buy!

Mechanically a solid game but suffers from the most basic fault of a typical co-op game - the best player making the optimal plan and everyone else just playing according to it. The players have to be of a very similar skill level to play and enjoy this - inexperienced players are reduced to spectators.

With a solid group it is quite fast and enjoyable co-op.

My wife is not into board games, but I convinced her to watch Whil Wheaton's Tabletop edition of Pandemic and she was immediately intrigued. Now, the two of us team up and cure the world from diseases at least once or twice a week. It's easy to play and understand, and you can win as easily as you can lose. We are definitely going to pick up the expansion to help add a little more chaos into the tactics we are already mastering. I definitely recommend this game for any kind of player, especially if you want a peaceful evening thanks to the cooperative-only mechanics; no competitive hostility necessary!

RATING: 8.5
I can understand the comments about the way on player can tak control and tell others what to do. This is a problem common to most co-op games I think. Fortunately, in my gaming group, this is not an issue.

This is one of the few games (apart from the smalle card games) that get multiple plays by the same people on the same gaming night.

I play it with the expansion to keep things more interesting. Without the expansion I would rate it a 7.5
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Honestly, the best co-op I have found.

This comes from three things:

First, it easy to explain how the game works so even new players can make good decisions and not just get bossed around.

Second, it plays out fairly quickly, unlike, say BSG.

Third, the 'robot' of the infection deck keeps pounding on the same places, meaning that there is real tension in the game.

I can't stop thinking about this game lately, it is so much fun!  At the time I bought this for a friend, it was only $22, but it is selling out everywhere (steadily raising the price) with good reason!

EDIT:  Prev. Owned so I can get the new edition.  Plenty of people I know own this anyways, so it isn't a top priority for my collection.  Nonetheless, I like having a good amount of coop games so I can play solo.  However, I like Flash Point for solo play a little better because the set up is a little less fiddly.

RATING: 9
A modern classic!  Pandemic is not as complex as the heavier games I like, but it really plays well.  Each of the characters has their own useful contribution.  There isn't one character that overpowers the rest.  There sure are a lot of ways to lose this game!  (And only one way to win)   It can be very difficult to win.  It takes luck to get a win, and any mistakes are severely punished by the game's mechanics.  It is still a fun game for beginners and families.  This one gets hauled out at Church functions, famiiy gatherings, game nights, A.A. meetings (!!!)  and almost any other setting you can think of.  Our band''s drummer took the board, peeled the top layer off and mounted it on one of those magnetic signs that you stick on the side of a car.  We played it on a bus while riding to shows, using magnets mounted into the pawns and painted magnets instead of the cubes.  It was a lot of fun!

I love the length of this game and the co-op play.  All around a fun one to break out.  The only part I find unsatisfying is the abrupt finish when you win.  Once you get the fourth cure I hate seeing all those viruses scattered about.  That's just me though....

Just always feel like there isn't much hope for saving the world. Co-op games have not done it for me. When I win I feel like it was simply a manageable distribution of city and epidemic cards. I find competing with another human opponent much more compelling.

RATING: 7
I’ve always thought that cooperative games were kind of dull, but this is a really fun one. This is an efficiency game, where you try to do as much in as little time as possible. You have to deal with immediate threats, but you also have a long term goal. The players form a team in contrary to Lord of the rings and Shadows over Camelot which feels more solitaire and try to cure the diseases. I have played several games where there has been tension to the end. It plays in a quite short amount of time, which is good. After a few plays moves become predictable and you need the expansion to stir things up.

I have played it with two, three and four (and with the expansion five) players. With two players I think it were a little easier than three, but that might depend on the pair of roles I got, but it worked otherwise equally good.

Pandemic belongs on every true gamer's shelf. But when I look at my collection and see it sitting there, I rarely want to pull it down. I just have gotten tired over the years of the Pandemic formula of shuffling the drawn cards back into the top of the deck. I know it creates tension, but it feels gimmicky to me and when I win (or lose), it feels mostly luck driven rather than skill. I can see this one actually falling below 7 over time for me.

RATING: 9
Very interesting cooperative game that uses some elegant design elements to keep the tension high without resort to something like the Traitor in "Shadows Over Camelot."  There are multiple ways for the system to win, so there's an almost constant feeling of tension after the first couple of turns.  I'm not certain the players can win without the Medic and the Scientist in play, but more experience may tell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ten plays. A tricky game to rate, because I think it's a good design, but one that just doesn't appeal to me. 

I like the fact that there isn't one puzzle to solve, but rather a broad situation which can be approached in different ways. I also think the mechanism for the spreading of disease is pretty ingenious, and it creates a good amount of tension; everyone holds their breath when the infection cards are turned over. 

Overall the whole package is very well done; the problem is that I just prefer games with competition. On top of that I just feel a bit bored with the whole thing nowadays. So: 5. Fans of co-op games take that with a grain of salt.

Addendum: my enjoyment of the game is heavily influenced by whether or not one player is bossing everyone else around.

Pretty good co-op game that is holding my attention through several plays. Collation errors are irksome but not crippling.

My first cooperative game in my collection. Great game. I think part of what makes this game work so well are the player roles, each role has a different special ability.

The one that started it all... again. Pandemic was our first modern board game and sparked the long lost love of tabletop gaming. Brilliant mechanics, cooperative play, challenging but beatable, intense but fun. We must have played this 2 or 3 times a night in the first few weeks.

Every time we choose to play now I think it's going to feel old because we've played it so much. But as soon as we're juggling treating diseases vs finding cures with our unique combination of roles (we blind pick), and under the constant threat of outbreaks, it just sucks us right back in!

And for every cruel moment there's usually a "phew, we got lucky", plus the option to dictate the difficulty makes this an absolute winner.

I believe there isn't a lot of decision making here to argue with. Interaction is reduced by people who will tell you what to do and a lot by your role. This is a simple family game with some added challenge if you add epidemic cards. 

I've seen the expansion and the bio-terrorist greatly enhances my liking of the game, but - as it would seem natural - it looses its "family" game tag. :)

So this is a "6" for now, till I make up my mind properly.

A lot of people consider this the quintessential co-op game. I disagree, there is a heavy amount of luck and having a certain set of roles almost guarantees victory on some of the easier difficulties.

Just received this July 1 2009, another co-operative game, just like Shadows over Camelot, and it really reflects what is happening the H5N1 flu pandemic in real world right now

Played it 3 times, lost 1st time because of "technical" problem (we didn't know that we can discover a cure in ANY research station) and lost 2nd time BIG TIME (pandemic!).  Won beautifully with 3 diseases eradicated and the last one cured (with just 1 city infected) the 3rd time :)

IMHO this is one of those co-op games where one overbearing person simply plays by themselves by forcing everyone else to do what they want.  I love co-op games when done right (like Robinson Crusoe), but Pandemic has become tiresome to me because it seems like someone always plays the game by themselves.

This game builds with so much suspense that it makes immediate replay, in spite of repeated losses, fun. The action-point, variable player power, and card shuffling randomness mechanic make this game what it is. It's excellent and should stand the test of time or spawn newer revisions of its mechanics in differently-themed games, or both.

RATING: 7
Feels the smoothest of the coop games I've played, but I'm in a bit of strange position where I played Legacy first and this seems a bit too simple-ish. This game just seems more manageable than the other co-ops but at the same time so brutal with how epidemics work. Might have to try an expansion to bump the complexity up.

I think this gets some edge over other co-ops for some slight smoothness improvement and a theme I like quite a bit. But so far we're quite clearly not very good at the game.

Note: This comment is for the Pandemic base game & all of the exps.

I found am Android app that was this game online before I knew about Pandemic and I feel in love of it. It really wasn't until I watched Zee Garcia's reviews and comments on the Dice Tower that made me interested in it. Since this, it has become a stable in my collection and gaming group.

Rating = 10 due to it being a solid game, replayable, the exp. keeps the different in an ever-changing state, and easy to teach people. Will always play this game.

I have only one game under my belt, so take all this for what it's worth.

I've played all the major co-op games on the market (Lord of the Rings, Shadows over Camelot, Battlestar Galactica, and now Pandemic). Of those games, Pandemic is probably the simplest design and the easiest to understand. This is a good thing. My friend (who brought the game) plays regularly with his children, which is a Good Thing.

At the same time, I think I prefer the linearity of Lord of the Rings over Pandemic. I think this is because I prefer the sense of handling this particular obstacle (a given board in LotR) then the firefighting of Pandemic.

I also didn't find Pandemic to be nearly as gut-wrenching as other co-ops. I don't know why. Maybe world-threatening diseases don't trip my trigger as much as destroying The One Ring or shepherding the human race to Kobol.

A really interesting and very different feeling co-op game. I love how the difficulty just keeps ramping up throughout the game and the agonizing decisions about which cards to keep (especially since the cards can be used in several different ways). The effects of an epidemic card and the individualized player powers from the role cards make the game feel really thematic - honestly much more than I expected. I do feel like some of the role cards are clearly better than others, but they're all useful. The production quality is really fantastic, as well. I love the dark color scheme on the map and the transparent plastic disease cubes. The outbreak/infection markers are some of the nicest plastic tokens I've ever seen in a game.

The components are quite good, the gameplay is excellent, but overall I haven't played it enough to rate it, and will not.  The biggest phobia I have is of diseases that I can't see, and any reminders of it typically send me on a handwashing spree for a LOOONG time.  So any desire to play this game is NIL, hence since there really isn't a way for me to rate it otherwise, rating it by how much desire I have to play it according to the BGG suggestions of ratings for once.  Just a game that plays to my phobias, if it were rethemed probably be right up my alley though.

RATING: 7
the first and likely the last co-op game I'll buy.  This isn't because I don't like the game, in fact, I enjoy playing it a lot, I just can't imagine myself wanting to have an option for another co-op game in my collection.  perhaps, had Defenders of the Realm come out sooner, I would have bought that game instead if only because I prefer the fantasy theme, but at this point i'm glad I didn't because I also only need so many fantasy themed games too.  Great game.  Get the expansion.

They say it's a cooperative game... I say it's a solitary one. I don't see how you can play this game with someone else. I've tried it and still don't see how.

Unlike other cooperative games like Arkham Horror where you can do what you want without necessarily losing the game, Pandemic makes you go and do things. You have no freedom... well, if you do what you want, you will lose.

I also don't see what's the big fuss about this game. It's shallow and has little replayability. It's always the same thing over and over again. :/
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Just finished my second play of this game, and unfortunately, I think of this game in relation to Eldritch Horror (which I love). How does it stack up? Both games build tension marvelously. However, where eldritch revolves on dice rolls, Pandemic's gameplay is elegant and streamlined. This makes the game somewhat more methodical, and less of a romp, but still feels thematic as the game is simply very well designed. It is also 1/4 to 1/5 the length of Eldritch horror, and so even though the potential for memorable narratives in this game is far lower, and it manages to generate at most frustration as opposed to dread, I have to give this game the better score. This is also a difficult game. I have played Edlritch Horror 11 times and have triumphed over the warped machinations of the old gods 7 times. Of my two plays of this game I have twice been thwarted by the the lowest and most primordial of earthly life forms. Those looking for a challenge will not be disappointed. The one theme breaking element I encountered in this somewhat abstracted game, is at the end of my most recent play (2 player) all diseases were cured, 2 were eradicated, and there was one disease cube of both of the other colors left and we lost because we ran out of cards to draw. I say, give us more character cards to draw (with more interesting resources and events) even if it means also adding more epidemic cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An utterly gripping struggle for the fate of the human race! Players struggle to optimize their reactions to new cases of infection and outbreaks. Whenever the game proceeds without any horrid events for a while, a mixture of hope and impeding doom slowly builds up, only to give way to utter desperation the moment that yet another outbreak occurs. 

Even though both the theme and the mechanisms are somewhat abstract, they work perfectly with one another. Certainly the best abstract co-operative game! (Forbidden island by the same author employs almost all of the mechanisms of this game, and it does not come across nearly as intense as this game.)

I'm a big fan of co-operative games, and this game really ticks that box for me... probably the best of the pure co-op games in my opinion, especially considering the short duration and the intensity (when the board is loaded with disease cubes and you're 1 step away from disaster).

The card mechanisms are really interesting too.. such as the epidemic cards which come out of the players draw deck, and particularly the "intensification" of the infections, by placing the discarded cards on top of the deck after each epidemic... I love to pause at this point in the game explanation, while the realisation of this settles in.. the Ooohs and Aahhhs at this point are delightful.

I love puzzles, and Pandemic is a puzzle. Comparing Pandemic to Flash Point, as my friends do, is like comparing chess to checkers. Checkers is less elegant, clumsier, but arguably more "fun" to play. Chess is the better game, deeper and more clever and complex. Same here-- Pandemic is a cooperative puzzle game, Flash Point is basically a dungeon delve. Pandemic has a clever mechanism for seeding obstacles via the infector deck-- Flash Point is lazy and uses dice to do that. Pandemic is Braid, Flash Point is Limbo. One is a majestic marriage of clever mechanics and interesting gameplay, the other is just puzzle-by-numbers with better art and theme. If you like Munchkin instead of Agricola, then yes, Flash Point is the coop game for you. 

And as for the "quarterbacking" problem, my solution is just learn to work in groups. It's not hard.

A fun co-operative board game that gets everyone involved and working as a group. Nice to mix in with highly competitive games. The mechanics work well and usually very close to winning when you lose so it always feels nail biting.

The only quibbles I have with the game is its slightly fiddly stacking all the disease cubes when you have a cluster of disease, research stations and pawn pieces. Also the colour of the researcher and medic a little to similar.

Another complaint I have had players say is it can feel a little anti-climactic not having to remove all the disease cubes.

Amazing game. My wife and I have played this game many times and keep coming back to play it. We typically go through cycles of playing a game once or twice a week for about a month then will cycle through to another game. We keep coming back to this game and highly recommend it! The cooperative play / planning aspect is refreshing when compared to other strategy / economic / resource management games because typically you're working for yourself and are against the other player(s) to a certain extent, where as Pandemic you're on the same team.

So far my favorite co-op game.  Tough choices and a lot of tension when drawing cities, especially after an epidemic card has come out.  For the first few games we played that any 4th cube added to a city would trigger an outbreak and believe me, this made the game much harder.

The best gateway game I know.  The cooperative mechanic is new to non-gamers, and can really get them excited about the possibilities of designer board games.

Works great as a non-gateway, regular gamer's game too, albeit a fairly light one.

It's just very well done.  You'll get an occasional game that's a total blowout one way or the other, but usually it's tight and tense right up to the end.

Ok, so I was excited about this.  But, after one play, we all felt it was way to easy.  We did play introductory, but still it seems very easy.  I'm also not sure there is enough going on to have a lot of replay.

Pandemic has done something great in the boardgame world. The cooperative style of play is fantastic. The game mechanic is very simple and can be easily taught. The masterful design of this game lies in its ability to play simpley yet create a strong amount of gaming tension. This game is absolutely incredible!

Egyszerűen nem tudom megunni a világ megmentését.
Remek kooperatív játék állítható nehézséggel (legendás szinten még sohasem nyertem). Nagyon jó az alapszituáció, elfoghat az „ez a valóságban is megtörténhet” érzés. Folyamatos pengeélen táncolás, reszkető kézzel húzott fertőzéskártyák.

Pandemic is a harsh but fair mistress.  This is a game that you are likely to lose, but even though the odds are stacked against you the game feels fair and balanced.  Every loss usually comes with a "but we were so close" analysis.  It is not the hardest game in the world by any means, but it is challenging enough to keep people's attention and the wins are satisfying when they come.

First game, like the theme a lot. Won with scientist and researcher, a very good combo for beginners.
Several games down the line, and still:
Not getting a 10 because little wooden cubes are boring and the cure stations are just little wooden house shape that haven't been even painted.
The game is relatively cheap (around $30), but still, these days, games should come up with better playing pieces than wooden cubes.
Difficulty not a major issue. Play at easy level with 4 epidemics, slowly increase to 5 and 6.
Otherwise, love all of it.

RATING: 10
Played a half dozen solitaire games and absolutely love it. Every game that I have played with five infection cards has come down to the wire, and I lost my first attempt at six infections with four characters by running out of yellow cubes during a chain reaction outbreak. Waiting to add On the Brink until I get 20 or 30 rounds in. This is a bit too deep for my kids, but great for solitaire and I will play with my wife and gaming group as well. I like this better than Forbidden Island as it has more interesting decisions and deeper strategy, however Forbidden Island is a good primer for this, and I will probably stick with that for play with my kids. The theme in this game is also great. It doesn't feel pasted on at all. 

Update: 20 plays in and this has become my favorite game. I love solving the basic puzzle every time - how to cure the virus with a limited number of actions. It is very basic, but depending on how it sets up and your characters it is always different. 6 epidemic cards has become the norm and I can usually win with 2-4 characters over half of the time. Also, get the On the Brink expansion if you like the base game. It adds some really cool tweaks, and the extra characters are nice.

I really enjoyed the cooperative nature of the game. With a group of people that can get overly competitive when playing each other, it's fun that the game receives other players frustrations. 

Pandemic manages to keep you at least slightly on edge the entire game. By the time you work your way through curing a couple of diseases, the others may be quite out of hand, which ups the excitement and certainly makes you consider how to play the game better the next time. 

The only downside I noticed was that each person has ideas on the best way to win, or even how to make a move during their turn. If there is at least 1 player with strong opinions, you may end up dealing with tension between players. But, that's a great opportunity to work on communication! 

Pandemic skillfully stresses while providing an exciting challenge for you and your friends.

A good coop-game, very interesting and intense.

Problem is, that it´s a solitaire game, at least if you talk to the other players, as the group and not the individual will decide the next step and this kills the game for me, well atleast for the multiplayer part.

If you like coop games, you should give it a try.

This has some things I don't want in games, most of them are typical co-op game problems: 

-Alpha gamer problem.

Great game for a lot of people, but not for me.

I do not understand why people enjoy this game.  It is not fun nor interesting.  Cooperative games either turn into one of two things: 1) the person with the best ideas strategy tells everyone else what to do and its basically like playing alone, or 2) this person just watches people make poor decisions.  Either way it is not fun.

This is one of the few games if you asked me if I wanted to play I would say no.

A really well thought out cooperative game, with plenty of tension. However, there is normally only really one 'right' decision in any situation, making much of the 'group play' element redundant once you know what you're doing. Also, the end game mechanic (you win by finding all 4 cures, not by actually curing the diseases) leaves you a bit cold.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun cooperative game with great mechanics to control the villain element of the game - the diseases.  The variable player powers add a lot to the game and it is genuinely cooperative, you actually work together, as opposed to games where you all work towards the same goal completely seperately. As an occasional play I think it is probably a big winner but isn't something I am going to want to play very often.

I actually think the rating will probably go down as I play it more.  The more proficient you are at maximizing the efficiency of your turn the less interesting the gameplay is going to be and unlike other games where you will butt heads with other proficient players in this one you will just be agreeing with each other on what everyone should do.  After a while the game will almost play itself and your chances of success will depend entirely on the draw of the cards and how many epidemics you are playing with.  

After many plays, it is starting to feel a little autopilot.  Still a good game but not something I want to buy.  It doesn't have a lot of depth but it is a fun game.

The first cooperative game that really turned me on to the genre.  I find the mechanic of how and where diseases break out (shuffling the discards and putting them on the TOP of the draw deck, so that outbreaks tend to happen in the same places over and over) delightfully clever.

Pretty fun as cooperatives go. The first game really felt like we were at the mercy of the cards, but by the second one, I was starting to see the true amount of options we had. It seems very difficult, and I am not completely convinced that clever strategy outweighs the randomness here, but it was fun enough that I want to play again and find out. 
UPDATE: Playing this more pushed my rating up and then back down. I guess I can't complain if I had fun playing it 30+ times before I got bored. But ultimately once you figure out the "right way" to play, you just execute your plan and sometimes get screwed by the cards. The end.

RATING: 8
Played it first with 4 players, and enjoyed it.  It uses various mechanics that are different from other games, which makes it fun to play for a change.  Reshuffling just the discard pile of the infector deck is a nice touch -- you have to watch out for what cities were already infected, because they'll be on the diseases' hit list again soon!  Also, player cards are gone forever once played, so it's not good to discard them due to hand limits.

I've played with 2 players and with 3, and it works quite well in both cases.  2 is probably hardest, because you have the least special abilities, and you can't fan out to cover the board.

I've even played with 5 players, and it can be quite hard.  There's a lot of down-time; you may have just drawn enough cards for a cure, but you have to wait for 5 Infector phases (including your own) before you can even attempt a cure.  A lot can happen in 4 draw phases and 5 Infector phases!  Outbreaks are the thing to worry about here.

I tried playing with the Epidemics just randomly shuffled into the deck instead of roughly equally spaced, and it's too easy -- if the first Epidemic shows up after half the deck is gone, then the re-infection risk for any city (and hence the risk of Outbreaks) isn't as big.

Good fun. Consistently creates tension. Certain combinations of Roles prove more effective (and thus preferable) than others.

Most glaring flaws are 1) often a player's turn becomes "scripted" because the best course of action is obvious (even turns ahead), and 2) the "cooperative" play becomes overbearing with every player's turn becoming a committee-decision.

We don't actually get this to the table a lot, in neither of my two and a half player groups. Either it's not confrontational enough, or it's theme is not fantastic enough. Funny is that my wife doesn't really want to play this one either. I'll have to go and play it with those friends of whom I know that they enjoy it some time.

The mechanics are neat. Particularly fun is how when you shuffle, you keep the cards you drew before on top, so you know that those troublesome herds of disease will pop up again, and soon. This does make gaming the deck a valid strategy as well of course, and maybe hurts thematic immersion a bit, but adds more strategy to the game.

What I also like is the way the difficulty levels make the game suitable for all kinds of groups.

I like coop games, and this one lends itself well to it.  Trying to maximize the entire team's play may be overwhelming for some, who may think the other players are playing for them.  Truth is, players should make recommendations as to what they think the optimal moves are, else this may just has well be a one player game.  With this being said, I liked the game and the folks I played it with, thus I had a good experience and would play it again.

The components are nice, and the epidemic mechanic, where the discard deck is added to the top of the draw deck works great, giving the feel of an epidemic/outbreak.

While initial plays were certainly interesting, I feel as though I have been spoiled by Lord of the Rings in terms of what I *could* expect from a Euro-style cooperative game. I understand that this has been the watermark for cooperative games since, I find that plays become same-y (and I don't mean this in a good way).

Fun game.  The intro game was very easy with no tension.  The normal game with two players felt good we had some lucky draws lots of good even cards and like colours to players already holding them. 3 outbreaks 2 centres and 4 cures.  Things on the board where looking ugly a couple more turns and things would have been very different.

RATING: 7.5
Great cooperative game. It's a pretty easy one to teach new players and it's easy to get everyone involved in the game.
Occassionally there are games that just seem too easy and then there are some that are impossible to win. Really that just depends on how fast the "infection" cards come into play.
Might look at the expansion to see if that levels things out or if it adds some additional options that balance the game play.

This is probably a biased ranking as it was our first foray into modern designer board games, so it has a fair amount of nostalgia. About a year after discovering this game and we still enjoy it.

RATING: 7
After 6 games, I'm wondering if maybe we should bump it from 5 epidemics to 6. We've won half our games pretty easily, with a 4th game being a near-win. In other words, I feel like the game might be too easy at "normal." The shortness, theme and general feel of the game are great though. If having 6 epidemics ups the challenge, I might bump the rating up to an 8.
=============
Update: 14 games in, Pandemic is still a solid co-op game and 6 epidemics is still a good challenge. It stays at 7 though. I suspect I just don't like co-op games enough for one to reach the upper echelon.

This is the poster child game for the alpha gamer. If you like to tell everyone around the table (or be told by someone!) how to move and who to give the cards to, this is the game for you! Won't play this game again, despite all the hype.

If you are looking for similar co-op game, have a look at Defenders of the Realm. The added luck component due to dice to remove minions eliminates the alpha gamer problem: the best laid out plan can be ruined by the roll of a few dice. Also the game is much more thematic, a clear winner! Never looked back since playing Defenders of the Realm.

RATING: 9
Love this game!  Co-operative strategy game in which the players are characters with different abilities, and they have to work together in order to prevent four diseases from doing some significant damage to humanity, and causing a pandemic.

As with many co-operative games, experienced players need to be willing to step back and not take over inexperienced player's characters by only providing options during the player's turn that they would do.  It is not going to interest players if they are basically just going to have to sit back and watch the other players manage their character.  Experienced players need to allow the new players to make mistakes and possibly not end up winning the game.  Also, because there is an app for this game which allows one person to control as many characters as they want to play (up to player max) this is a tendancy that is made worse because in that situation, they really CAN do just that, and those players need to work even harder at stepping back because they often have played MANY times with MANY of the different characters and will be controlling right from the start.

That said, it is a really fun game with the right group of people, and if you have people that are experienced with it and can read others, it is an easy one to get a new player involved in since the group is working co-operatively with no betrayer and can offer up suggestions about what the person can do with their character during their turn and what the impact will be on the other players.

A fun and interesting cooperative game that is at heart a sequential action puzzle. I think it would work best if players minimized table talk, which is actually a fairly major drawback in a cooperative game (which should encourage interaction). It needs to be played on the "harder" settings, as few epidemic cards lead to a game that seems to have no possibility of failure; hence no feeling of accomplishment.

It's a family co-op. I think one of the first true co-ops (?). Beside the fact that i loathe full co-ops, there is a traitor expansion i might try.. but even if that works, the theme dosen't get me. A red cube is never a disease or infected population.. it's a red cube.. and especially for co-ops the theme should get you (flash point or ghost stories does a much better job).
But since it is aimed at families that is probably the maximum theme you can put into a game about disease & the end of humankind.

-----------------------------

I loathe this game.. it's a cooperative abstract, with the aim of cleaning coloured cubes from a grid.

This is the king of the coop games. Very nicely made game, with great theme and cool components. The only downside is that i don't like coops. The alfa player try to solve the whole puzzle alone and this goes on all the time. I'm sorry but i'm baised and i want to make the best choices by myself. I see great replayability because every game is different and i believe this game has a great price / value. After a few more games with the right group i started to fall in love with this game. The rules are quite easy, but to beat the game is hard as hell. It is so intense, but it lets you believe that you always have a slight chance to win after all. It is so elegant and encourages clever play!

Pros / Cons:
-If you like coops, this game might be interesting to you.
-Great replayability.
-Great price / value.
-Elegant gameplay with easy rules but with deep meaningful choices.

-If you don't like coops you will start to hate them.
-The alfa will be playing alone and you will be just moving your piece on the board while at the same time moving some cubes up and down.

Despite having put in a couple dozen solo plays of this game and seeing just about every role combination possible, I've decided to finally raise it to a 10.  It's hard to argue with still having fun with a game after 30+ plays!

I kept it at a 9 for so long because it's a little too light for my normal game group, but anytime I play with my parents, it's a blast.  I prefer Agricola now for solo games, since it's newer to me and has a bit more depth, but this game really deserves a 10.  It's fun every time and especially with the harder difficulties, can get a lot of tension and excitement.

After getting On The Brink, I realize this is definitely one of my favorite games, well worthy of a 10.

Pandemic (along with Dominion and Tales of the Arabian Nights) was my very first boardgame purchase after discovering BGG.

This is one co-op game that works really well, although I could see how more experienceed players could more or less drive the actions of less experienced players to the extent ofnon-participation. As long as people play as a team then this is a definite winner.

The theme fits perfectly, the rules are simple and the mechanic governing the spread of the various diseases is absolutely fantastic.

So far: Won one (two player), lost one (three player).  Currently my co-op game of choice. Willing to trade as it's not so popular with my regular opponents.

Awesome cooperative game, with a high degree of difficulty designed in to keep it that way.

Other BGG users have reported an eventual lessening of interest, because of the similarity of mechanics each game, but other then that I can see few weaknesses to this one.

Excellent game - rating it a starting 7.5 after 5 plays (and only 1 win!)

7/01/10 - Play #29 - I've beeen playing this solo, 4-characters, at heroic level, and finally won a 3rd time at that level. The first 2 times were back-to-back and felt (relatively) easy; then I lost about 6 straight before winning again tonight.

The game has an evil streak, and I moved it up to an 8.

Made by the same guy as Forbidden Island, and it shows. The game is basically a more hardcore version of Forbidden Island, and where Forbidden Island is a bit too light, this is a bit too heavy for the time it takes to play. It's still good, and fun, but it runs a bit long in the teeth for what it is.

Also, if you can find The Incredibles (of Pixar fame) variant give it a shot. It's a lot of fun, but somewhat harder.

Not a big fan of coop games as the ones out there, even currently popular ones are not that good IMO (most get "directed" by some aggressive smarmy chunkwad and are not truly coop). This game is wonderful for coop and demands that you work together. The balance is absolutely wonderful - pretty challenging but not frustrating, and even when you lose you usually feel like you made a good effort or got real close. Too bad on the misprint thing in China, as I ordered this in May and am still waiting for the reprint.

A coop game that has feels a lot more like Minion Hunter than LotR or Shadows Over Camelot. Fortunately, it doesn't have the crazy luck element of Minion, so winning the game is more than a pipe dream.

The five special abilities are interesting and make the characters play very differently from each other. It makes the character differences in Shadows and LotR seem like small aftertoughts. This also makes the game feel even more cooperative, since each character feels necessary.

The way the top and bottom of the infection deck are used leads itself to wonderfully thematic results, while leading to euro-like behavior.

As icing on the cake, the game plays quickly, so it can be played over lunch, and is suitable to end a gaming session.

““Disease is the retribution of outraged nature.” -Hosea Ballou

I found it on the interweb (not verified). I had to look Hosea up but the quote captures the moment.

GAMEPLAY
A co-operative game where the players try to stop the spread of 4 deadly diseases across the globe in the largest cities in the world. On a player’s turn, you may move around the world, halt the spread of a disease or with gathered resources cure a disease. The game works against the players, but each has a special ability to help slow the spread of the disease, move around the board faster, or more quickly find cures. A common issue with co-op games is that they can really be played by a single person. This is a fair comment and I have played it solo several times, its tons of fun. If you are playing in a group make sure that there is not a single player directing everyone, try to allow each player to have space to decide how to play so that everyone stays engaged.
COMPONENTS
The most important game pieces are the infection cubes in four different colors. I was thinking that it would be cool to have microbes of different shapes but the cubes simplicity keeps the board well organized and a quick visual sweep of the board gives a clear understanding of the crisis. The cards and board are of good quality and the art is clear but not remarkable.
THEME
An excellent unique vision for a game. Cinematic gameplay. The first time I played with my brother it felt as though we were flying around the world to hold off the infectious threat. The tension builds throughout the game as outbreaks build. Every time I have played the outcome has been extremely close. This building tension is a credit to the game mechanics and how the theme integrates extremely well with the rules.
WHO IS IT FOR?
Casual, non-competitive play is found here. With the game rushing the players towards the inevitable doom of mankind, its fairly simple gameplay will be entertaining for most. I have played solo and its fun but its designed for 2 to 4 players. Games last about an hour. This game is not heavy and there is a small amount of determinism as the card stack can prevent victory but not too often.

RATING: 7
While I think it's a great game, many in my group don't like the pure co-operative aspect (i.e., no chance for screwage, no saboteur/traitor roles).  They feel there is no satisfaction in winning because you are only defeating the card draw (as opposed to a human opponent).
This may improve with the "On The Brink" expansion.

Only played once, but was only so-so on it. Actually, played a little too quick for me. Also, it feels a bit like other people are playing for you at times. For co-op games, I much prefer Shadows over Camelot because of the traitor.

Liked this more the second time around.

Had this in my collection for a while before I finally broke it out for a solo round. Before long, those solo rounds almost became a nightly activity and before even longer, got it to the family table. 

Wow! This one is about as streamlined as they come. The cooperation, actions, decision-making and options all are creative, simple and extremely engaging. Pandemic is the easiest game I have to set up and take down and can fit on my own computer desk. It is inexpensive (compared to most games) and has a tremendous theme. I'm tired of generic fantasy and dungeon-esque paper mache. I wish more games were this well-rounded and amazing. 

My only quibbles is that this can be tense, sometimes difficult to win and, most unshockingly, be an AG's stomping ground. Active participation and suggestions are key but let players decide for themselves in the end. Jus' sayin.

As Wil Wheaton said at some point " i had more fun losing than game than winning it" (sic). Love the theme, reminds me a little bit of Stephen King's "The Stand" and i would like to play the "On the Brink" expansion at some point. Never won with the six epidemic cards, but almost every time  someone will cry out "let's play again, we will win this time!".

Not bad and I'll always say yes to a game, but won't be my first choice.

Played 2 player first time and after three attempts beat it. Played it a few more times winning some and losing some. Then added the new virulent epidemic cards from On the Brink. We won with 4 and 5 epidemics but could not win with 6. Really fun game and honestly we both worked together evenly--no quarterbacking. We wanted to beat it so badly we just played all day.

RATING: 8
Excellent mechanics (reshuffling the discards in to intensify infections is brilliant) and easily grasped theme. I've never had a problem with people Taking Charge and I like the coop nature. I do have concerns that after a dozen plays or so it'll feel like Every Game Is The Same. But let's be realistic. I almost never play a single game that much. And even if I did that would be (random numbers to illustrate point) 12 play @ 45 minutes a play = 9 hours of fun.

Pandemic is excellent!  It is my first experience of a co-operative board game and I am rather surprised to report that it manages to be "elegant"!  Having seen people chugging through LotR and BSG before left me to wonder whether it would ever be possible to use the words "co-operative" and "elegant" in the same sentence.  It also seems to appeal to people who would not necessarily be excited by any of my other games (presumably because of the theme), which is handy.

Számomra ez a legjobb kooperatív játék. Tudósként küzdeni a vírusok ellen egész jó ötlet. De még könnyű verzióban is nagyon nehéz legyőzni a játékot, nem  hogy nehezebb verzióban. Azt csak nagyon jó kudarctűrő képességekkel megáldottak részére javaslom. 

Játszottam profikkal és ők bebizonyították, ezt a játékot bizony meg lehet nyerni, persze ehhez nagyon tudni kell használni a karakterek speciális képességeit. 

Nagy az újrajátszhatósági faktora, több mint 70-szer játszottam már és még nem untam meg. Jól működik 2-3-4 fővel is.

One of the best co-op games ever. No one will be offended by the theme of trying to save the world by finding a cure so there's no chance of offending anyone by playing this game.

I like the game but my husband doesn't so I don't get to play it much. I have the original one so the newer expansions won't work well (and probably aren't a good idea anyway because of how my main gaming partner, my husband, feels about the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great and tense cooperative game. I love the aspects of the outbreak cards being shuffled back on top of the draw pile. This is a very realistic and quit easy way to build up more tension. Level of difficulty can be adjusted appropriately. Furthermore, each player I introduced to Pandemic really liked it.

RATING: 5
A fun game and people seem to enjoy it, but it doesn't speak to me like I hoped it would. The game, to me, is a combination of setting up a very long term strategy and executing it with occasional breaks to very short term tactical calculations. The randomness from placing the cubes on the map seems to not deliver the true variety of experience that randomness brings to other games (like the available cards in Dominion or the private hands in Agricola).

Very interesting game which always feels like teetering on the edge of disaster.   Theme is very well implemented, and I recommend avoiding playing this game with anyone who will hog the decision-making (i.e. "Ok, this is how you need to play").  When it is truly cooperative, it shines.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A little repetitive after a fair number of plays.  However, definitely one of my favorite games, and certainly a fantastic solo game.  Recommended as a gateway game for non-gamers as well as for established gaming groups.  The game has a means of varying the difficulty, but the difficulty also varies with the number of players and the roles being played.  I would probably rate the game a bit higher if there were a bit better way of controlling the difficulty reliably across number of players and roles.  Solid theming and more tension than almost any game that I've ever played.  Strongly recommended.

Starts out fun the first game. Second game still fun, but more familiar. Third game feels like more of the same.

There are not enough variables to keep this game fresh and interesting. While playing, there is usually only one, or maybe a few "optimum" choices for each player to make. And if you're the Dispatcher...woo-hoo, you get to move another player's pawn for your turn. Big fun there! Not.

Defenders of the Realm does this concept much, much better.

Played this with my Mom, who is in no way a gamer or nerd. She said she had a good time, although looking back I think I made nearly (but not quite) all of the decisions in the game! But we did work together, and I do think she enjoyed spending the time with me. 

As we all know, coop games are GREAT for introducing non-gamers to board games. This game serves that purpose very well. Plus, I randomly have a lot of medical professionals in my life, so the theme is relatable! Overall I am happy with the purchase. I can tell the game can be very challenging, and you do need to strategize. Good compromise between accessibility and replayability.

This game is very engrossing! The game is difficult which just adds to the tension and excitement. That is to say, the game can be VERY difficult on the hardest setting, but since you work as a team the defeat is never taken personally. My friends are often wanting to play this which is a bonus. The only negative is there is a large luck component, but that doesn't bother me too much.

I like that you can scale the difficulty of this game based on the number of epidemic cards, events, and player powers. There can be lots of tension to the game which has led to some awesome moments. 

The structure of the game can cause an 'alpha' player to appear but I find that to be a great challenge of the game. It is a challenge to the other players because they need to find a way to communicate with the alpha player. And it is a challenge for the alpha player to stop playing in that manner, which can be a very valuable experience.

Also, I must recommend the On the Brink expansion for the additional role and event cards.

Pandemic is simply put one of the best gateway co-ops to date. It's easy to teach, as well having a theme everyone can understand. The game always goes over well with pretty much everyone I introduce it too. The base game will give you a decent amount of mileage before needing to worry about expansions, however On The Brink, can be bought with the base and integrated easily, since it mostly adds more roles and ups the player count to 5. 

Speaking of which the expansions  add easy-to-integrate modules that can greatly change up the gameplay for those that want more of a challenge. Great game, one that's becoming a cult classic in modern board gaming.

Best co-op game I've played. The variable player powers make this enjoyable. However, I don't think co-op games are really my thing. I don't really like the solving a puzzle with other people aspect. I have to intentionally not just solve the puzzle myself and tell other people what to do and instead let them make decisions.

RATING: 7.1
One of the first games that come to mind in the co-op genre.

Can suffer from alpha player syndrome, but can still be an interesting puzzle with a risk management element to figure out (ie: should we treat City A or City B this turn to try to prevent an outbreak from happening?).

Definitely not required, but the On The Brink expansion adds a lot of very nice stuff to mix with the base game after you've won some standard-level games to keep things from being predictable.

RATING: 8
For my money this is the best co-operative game to date, although there are too many fiddly rules and oddball mechanisms for this to really be the 'gateway' game that it ought to be given its topical theme. Whether or not you win isn't decided by how well you strategise so much as how favourably the cards come out of the random draw decks and that's set by the initial shuffle. Even as a smoke and mirrors illusion though, this is a worthwhile activity as the game racks up the tension and then teases you by letting you think you lost by a narrow margin. The 45 minute playing time is just right.

Another average co-op fine if you want a lightish co-op, in fact probably much more elegant than many of the others. I can't see wanting to play this much more, I prefer the heavier co-ops if I have to.

RATING: 7
Not the first cooperative game, but the one with which every other one gets compared to. Pandemic truly gives you that epic feel. Starting out at the CDC in Atlanta, you and your team travel the world with the hope of CURING all four disease outbreaks...not stopping, curing. This is a game that definitely ramps up the difficulty. Once you get a feel for how the game works in easy (which can still be tough) the following levels require real...cooperation.
This game can suffer from the 'alpha gamer.' If there is a more dominant person in the room, they usually tell everyone else what to do, rather than work together.

Though the diseases aren't named, you can't help but do so. The black disease is always the Zombie Outbreak in my house.

RATING: 7.5
I love this game! It can get really tense sometimes which makes it so fun! After you've beaten the game a few times it does feel repetitive though. It's the kind of game you want to and look forward to playing again, but with a different group of people. Because once you've beaten the game with those people, you're satisfied and don't feel the need to play it again.

I really love the way the "AI" works with this game.  Great fun, even as a solo game, controlling two or more roles. It feels like a puzzle that can be worked out, but there are always surprises that make it crucial to strategically adapt to the current state of the board.

A co-op centered around the cure and eradication of several diseases that have sprung up around the world. Variable player skills allow for differing strategies, with games becoming increasingly tense as diseases spread and outbreaks occur. Fairly challenging, very enjoyable.

Wow, I can't believe a co-op game without any human adversary is so challenging. I really feel like this is a '5', but despite this fact I'm almost always up for a game -- til we beat the damn thing, at least. Pandemic provides a surprisingly difficult experience without being overly frustrating (unless you draw back-to-back pandemics, then that is frustrating).

The main complaint I have is that sharing information is too clunky -- if you play without open hands, as the game rules insist, you need to ask your teammates what their hands are very frequently. It can be boring if you totally cede control of the plays to the most experienced player, but that might be what it takes to win.

I liked it more at first, and initially rated it an 8.  But over time I found myself shying away from it. Among co-ops, this is nearly the worst for quarterbacking, already a problem with the genre. One or two players (the ones with the most experience and/or pushiness) usually end up deciding the moves for everyone.

The granddaddy co-op that practically spawned THE modern genre, and it still delivers. Incredibly good at ratcheting up the tension, leading to the same hilarious moments with all new players (first few turns: "we got this!" Last few: "OH GOD"). Easy to teach and learn, hard to master. A few roles are duds, but generally they're pretty useful. All in all, a great package.

I hope this rating isn't blasphemous. I likely won't play this game again but I wouldn't say it's "bad", but rather it's not for me. I've yet to play legacy but I find vanilla pandemic to be extremely boring and stale. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of co-op board games (though there are others that I'm more open to) pandemic to me seemed like a game people rave about that plays like it's from early 2000.

For all the hype and praise lavished upon Pandemic, I was underwhelmed once I had the opportunity to play it. Let's get my biggest concern out the way first -- Pandemic has a high luck factor. More so than I expected, at least. Much of the game is quite random and not affected by strategy at all. You can play a perfect game and still lose, all because of something you have absolutely no control over. If I wanted to play a game with this much randomness, I'd have played Yahtzee! What else didn't I like about the game? Well, the outbreak track is ridiculously easy to set off, by no fault or error of your own. What's the point in playing a game where I can just as easily flip a coin to determine if I win or lose? Blah... such a shame, too. I was eager to like Pandemic.

It can be hard and tense and when we win it's a great feeling! And when we lose, we want to play again, so we can win!

First time we played Pandemic, I belileve we played at least 3 games in a roll, just so we could beat it (no, we didn't). 

Oh, yeah. I think pandemic was the third modern board game we (me and fragoso2718) played/bought, just after Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.

First played March 11th, 2008. Taught in ~10min, played in ~45min with 5 payers. Great co-opertive game with good tension. It has great luck/strategy ratio. Player work together to beat the virus'. Each player draws a role: operations expert(build a research station in current city); dispatcher(mover others pawns as your own or to another pawn); scientist(cure a disease with 4 cards instead of 5); medic(remove all cubes in one city for 1AP; administer known cure free) and researcher(may give others a card for 1AP if in same city). There are two decks in the game. 1) Infector city cards and 2) player city, special, and epedemic cards. Each players starts with a certain number of cards. On your turn you have 4APs to: move(adjacent city), flight(to/from city card in hand; discard), move from and to research station, or special actions(build research station(need card for the city you are in; discard), discover cure(discard 5 like color cards @ research station), treat disease(remove 1 cube), share knowlege(take/pass one card matching city both pawns are in). After 4APs, draw two player cards then draw two infector cards(place cubes in those cities). Players win if you treat 4 diseases, lose if you run out of player cards or 8 epedemics. I'd strongly recommend giving this purchase consideration.

-----------------------------

[i]Pandemic[/i] is a co-operative game where the players are researchers from the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, and are attempting to contain the global outbreak of four deadly diseases before the world succumbs to the plague. The game supports 2-4 players, though there is a variant available for a Solitaire game. This game uses networks and a few new ingenious mechanisms to simulate the spread of disease across the globe.

In order to cure the diseases, the players need to collect sets of cards from a deck, and then turn these sets of cards in at research centres around the world. The caveat is that within the deck the players draw cards from, there are special epidemic cards, which intensify the situation on Earth, bringing the players one step closer to their destruction, of which there are three ways that it can happen. These are the players running out of cards to draw from, more than 8 outbreaks occurring, or if there is more disease on the globe than they can cope with, simulated by running out of cubes to put on the board for a specific colour of disease.

[i]Pandemic[/i] is a fun game because of the interaction between the players, and the ideas and discussion that is generated as each person decides what to do on their turn. There have been accusations of [i]Pandemic[/i] being a ‘puzzle’ rather than a game, and I agree, but it is seeing whether you can beat the puzzle with your wits that forms the heart of the game, rather than anything else.  [i]Pandemic[/i] can suffer from one person dominating the game, telling everyone what they should do, and this is a big problem, in fact, one of the main reasons why I do not rate it higher, as it can ruin the discussion that makes this game what it is. It is hard to enjoy yourself when someone, who is usually right, is dictating your every move.

In conclusion, [i]Pandemic[/i] is a game that includes many unique decisions and mechanisms within it, which give it a feel unlike any other game I have played. It is this that keeps me coming back to the game, as well as the immense replayability resulting from the different difficulty settings and variable player amounts. The only problem is the possible domination of the game by a single player, most often occurring with players of varied experience levels.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Variable difficulty levels
- Good interaction and discussion
- Requires good planning and co-ordination

[b]Cons[/b]
- Can be dominated by a single player
- Difficult to play with different expereince levels

Awesome cooperative game.  I enjoyed the bio terrorist expansion, which adds to an already great game, and have started playing pandemic legacy which is AWESOME.   

the base game can have a tendancy for willful/loud players to drive the play of the group, but with subtle (or not so subtle hints) all can have a good time and everyone can make their own decisions.  too many epidemic cards makes this game very hard to win!!

Mar08: The first true coop that intrigued me enough to try.  I have to admit, the game play is just fascinating.  The idea to reshuffle the used infection cards back onto the top of the draw deck is amazing.  It's such an organic means on intensifying the infection.

The rest of the game can suffer a bit from the domineering player "you do this, you do that..." syndrome.  I'm not sure you can really avoid that in a coop.  Which is a lot of the reason I'd avoided them thus far.

Still, I've definitely been thinking about it a lot, which is the sign of a good game I suppose :)

Jun08: Wife has pointed out I'm a little too boisterous to play coop games with.  I try to reign myself in, but then it's just not fun.  In the end, just comes down to not loving coop I think.

Simply put, one of my favorite games of all time. The base mechanics are solid, and open to a broad range of players. With its relative difficulty and theme, it's not usually the first game I go to in breaking in a new gamer, but it's almost always in the first 2 or 3. So long as you can avoid playing with (or being!) a table general and embrace the co-op nature of the game, Pandemic is always a good time.

RATING: 9
What a great Co-op. This is the Co-op of choice. So simple, can be quite intense (one can always ramp up the difficulty or incorporate modules from the excellent expansion). Works really well and quite satisfying whether we win and save the world or we die from some nasty plague.

Pandemic is the first cooperative game I ever played. I always worry a bit with cooperative games because my most common cooperative partner is my wife, and there are many games she finds too tiring or complicated. 

This game is like a big, beautiful puzzle and it wears very well with multiple plays.

I love the variety of roles, the nice cards, the feel of curing a disease with a team, and the way that the game can scale up difficulty to reach simply cruel proportions.

This is a keeper and one of my all-time ten favorite games. Could not recommend more highly. Loses a very small 0.5 because I think it is just a bit too easy, even on the hardest levels.

I'm a sucker for cooperative play and this one delivers. The epidemic mechanic is a lovely bit of theme-driven gameplay, and the large and dramatic scope of the theme help draw you in. The difficulty of the game varies wildly based on the particular conditions, but even after a complete disaster you're usually still willing to give it another go. Primary drawback is setup time.

I always get a little confused when I hear people talk about how impossible this game is while I now routinely win on the hardest difficulty. Indeed a lot of it depends on the roles that you have available, but I suspect people get too caught up in treating the diseases and not enough in curing them. While the game can still occasionally explode out with little I can do about it, I felt the need to pick up an expansion to make it harder and add the option of a bio-terrorist to mix things up.

I also always hear about how these co-op games are a problem when there is an "alpha" who dictates what everyone should do, but I have yet to come across that. Then again, it might just mean I am that person (I am being glib. I don't actually think I am like that).

I found that the game is easy to teach and quite intuitive, also the actions available on your turn are simple but offer a wide range of approaches to solve any given crisis in the game.  I enjoyed discussing tactics and potential moves with other players and it certainly encourages interaction over solitaire play.  The flip-side of this is that I can imagine it's easy for one player to wrestle control of the whole game and tell people what to do if he/she is that kind of player, which would be a shame.

Played with 2 players, this game can be quite easy but it's possible to increase the difficulty in several different ways.  My girlfriend and I love playing this together and I think it's a fun family game (despite the slightly morbid theme).

What a classic, important board game. You can't help but respect what Pandemic represents. And you should. It's a smart, strategic play with beautiful, well-crafted ideas & components behind it. My big issue with Pandemic is how long it takes to play vs. the enjoyment that is derived from it. There's a massive chunk of the boardgaming community that will love this brain-wracking challenge and lengthy, back-and-forth communication that is required from something like Pandemic before making decisions... Problem is, for our group, you spend so much time planning that you end up stalling all of your plays. Often there's also a few power players that direct everyone else's moves and other players start feeling inconsequential. If a few players aren't happy, the whole group's morale takes a knock. Pandemic is great with the right crowd, it's a masterpiece of a game, but it's just too heavy, lengthy and bulky for most new players. This isn't a game you can just whip out and enjoy with anybody.

This a great, challenging co-op game which plays lovely with 2, 3 as well as 4 players. The theme, mechanics and also game play are exciting. After we are finished I always feel like playing another round. Due to the design, game rarely goes over 45 minutes, so it never feels long or boring - you are always on your toes to see whether you manage to win. The only critique is in regards to roles: some of the have obvious advantage, but others are not that easy to leverage by beginners.

RATING: 5
I'm not a big fan of this game. After about 4 or 5 plays, it's incredibly stale. The strategy is the same for every game despite any different roles or card luck, and thus the "alpha gamer"/quarterbacking problem is a BIG problem. There's not really room for any co-op. It's more of a solitaire game masquerading as a cooperative game. I have had fun when stacking the deck to make it practically impossible to win, and increasing the tension and gloom that way. But I feel even if I kept doing that it would get old again fast. Still, it's not too terrible.

EDIT: the Pandemic: In The Lab expansion vastly improves the game experience for me. I would probably rate Pandemic with In The Lab as a 7, maybe even an 8. I would not want to ever play Pandemic without that expansion.

Pandemic - introduces co-op and some really clever mechanics not to mention its fantastic looking! So if you are looking for a game that showcases modern board gaming, this is a very good example. It has a very low entry point as most players don't need to know what they're doing at all. And role cards and random disease locations will create some variety for repeat plays. It's main problem as a gateway game is you need to be extremely deliberate about keeping new players involved in each decision or you risk them becoming passengers and not gaining a sense of achievement or ownership. Another issue is that on the one hand you have a risk of the whole group losing, which may not be very satisfying. And of course you could just set the difficulty really low, but then you might give the feeling of there not being much of a challenge. Will best suit group of similar experience or at least people who are equally confident sharing their opinion.

A great co-op game with a variable difficulty for more experiences players.  A must with all co-op games is to not allow the most experienced player to dictate all players turns.

One of our favorites, it is good at keeping you at the edge of your seat at all times as you try to deal with the constantly spreading diseases while avoiding a loss from one of several possible ways. It plays quick and is very social, you can play it with a lot of different people and it goes quickly and stays fun after multiple plays.

OK, I am not yet sold on the genre, but there is a lot that's good in this game.  The graphics are superb and the game play is engaging enough.  What sets Pandemic apart from the other cooperative games out there is that it is realtively clean and playable quickly.  So, on that basis alone, it probably belongs in my collection.

Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. 

That being said, I could be convinced to play with the bio-terrorist module from the On the Brink Expansion

Good game but a couple of problems with it for me.  First, the roles are not different but equal in my opinion.  Secondly, this game definitely is subject to the alpha gamer.  In my group there are multiple alpha gamers and it can feel like you are running the show are just agreeing to keep the peace.

If you read any of my other comments, you can tell I appreciate a good theme. I haven't really played other co-op games (like Shadows Over Camelot) to compare to, but I really like having at least one co-op game in the collection. I love the interaction of all the mechanics in this game. Highly recommended.

One of the first cooperative mainstream games. One of the better co-ops in a genre that doesn't work that well for me except on the rare occasion. Basically you're trying to beat back piles of cubes that spring up in different map locations, some of your allies will do the same in other locations. Rinse, repeat,... hope for the best. OK. ... My favourite co-ops are those that incorporate a potential betrayer in your midst ... check out Betrayal at House on the Hill for a great co-op. For a good lighter co-op I would highly recommend Game of the Year 2013 Hanabi.

Cooperative game where every player has a unique character with unique capabilities that have to work together (really together, almost no mistake is allowed) in order to defeat the spreading of illness. The game is easy to explain, the idea is very good, I think that the mechanics are may be too general and can be applied to other games (forbidden island for instant, very similar), but the game is fun to play. The biggest issue that I have is that, for me, this game is, in reality, a solitaire game. The complexity is so high that, in the end, one player has to control almost everything in order to succeed.
Positive:
1. High complexity. When you win, there is a real feeling of victory
2. Easy to explain
3. The actions are easy, the difficulty lies in how to combine them
4. Quick to play and quick set up
Negative:
1. More suitable for 1 player
2. The best version, for me, is the digital one (tablet)

Co-op:hand management:crisis management:gateway

Very thematic fast playing co-op game, maybe the quickest playtime (45 min) for a co-op to date which is one of it's biggest strengths. Group think is definitey the game, yes a domineering person can spoil this AND that can be said for any co-op, don't play co-ops with those people!  

Decisions being fairly obvious is maybe the biggest flaw, there might be a few ways to skin the cat but the overall "puzzle" really has no depth to it, there is a little planning but its more of a tactical excerise of staying on top of things and it does that very well. It is going to feel very 'samey' fast but will still be worth pulling out once in awhile, especially with non-gamers. More characters or powers could have really helped with this, maybe even a double-sided map, mini expansion to come I suppose but these should have been included.

Great tension, easy to learn and fun are all more strengths, these really make it an excellent game for gateway to hook non-gamers on games, extra points for this. The difficulty level being scalable was sure an excellent inclusion and another strength.  Of course luck of the draw plays a big factor but we are not playing this for the high strategy element anyway, we are playing for the fun aspect which is definitely here in a short game so complaints about luck aren't as big as the others. Will scale well 2 to 4 so extra points for this. 

I would seem due to the missing roles and decreased mobility less players could be harder but the cards in hand when starting are different so I'm not sure yet and have only played two 4 player games to date. 5 Epidemic cards for 2 players is a good challenge at any rate.

The go to co-op experience. Lots of fun but suffers from the alpha co-op gamer and less experienced players become passengers, or on the flip side the experienced player has to just sit and be quiet to not ruin the fun for others (which is also not fun). I may have over played it over the years...

Bokkensprong 15/11/2013 met Luc, An, dochter en ik. Coöperatief spel waarin je samen medicijnen moet ontwikkelen om uitbrekende virussen over de hele wereld te bestrijden. Elke speler heeft een bepaalde rol met speciale eigenschappen (vb. dokter, operationeel expert,...). Kaarten uit een trekstapel bepalen at random in welke stad er virussen uitbreken, en van welke kleur. Spelers krijgen aan het eind van hun beurt ook nieuwe stadkaarten waarmee ze kunnen reizen of acties "afkopen". Er zitten wel een aantal epidemiekaarten tussen, die voor een escalatie zorgen van virussen in een bepaalde stad en de steden daarrond. Straf spel, spannend ook; aanrader.

I love this game. Definitely top five game and not leaving anytime soon. I love the mechanics of this game. While it doesn't have flashy bits (just standard eurocubes), the way infections, outbreaks, and epidemics work, it feels like you are fighting an actual disease outbreak. You can clean a city but in a few turns, more cubes are will be popping back in there.

I like that you do not have to eradicate a disease, you just have to develop a treatment. I also like that, even if you find a cure for a disease, you can still lose if that disease runs rampant and you run out of cubes.

A lot to like in this box. The On the Brink expansion takes it to another level and I don't see this one getting stale anytime soon with the combinations of starting setup, special even cards, and player roles that are now available.

There is also a decent community around the game producing fan made expansions.

Pandemic is a great game that has a very abusive way of making you enjoy it... the cooperation aspect is a lot of fun actually and flows very well in this game making every "special Event" card feel that more amazing while the "Epidemic" cards make everyone at the table sick... A real challenge to actually defeat where luck plays a factor as much as skill and where you need to really all look together if you want to stand a chance at winning! I highly recommend this game for all!

I actually like this quite a bit as a filler game, as it usually plays quite quickly and generates some challenge.  It's not something I'm probably going to want as a center of a gaming session, but it's one of the best co-op games out there as far as having legs to keep going for a while.

I really like this game, though it does have some problems that keep it from hitting the table too often. We've found that one player (or a few) will usually "take the lead" and start telling everyone else what to do on their turn. Usually by the end of the game, one or more of the players are really just "along for the ride"... I don't mind taking a backseat though, if everyone else is having fun.

Great intro game and one of the better coops. 

Nowadays I prefer coops/solo games where if you play perfectly then your win rate is 85%+, vs pandemic where perfect play will get you a win rate of ~60% at best.

With the expansions this is still fun to play now and again if you can get past (or don't care about) the win rate issue, and just enjoy the theme/gameplay which is excellent.

Cooperative game where diseases are springing up on the board and you have to work together to race across the globe, keeping the outbreaks under control while accumulating the cards you need to cure the diseases.  Each player has a special power, a hand of cards, and a limited number of actions per turn.  A bit like a group puzzling solving session.  Solid and challenging but a bit repetitive.

This is excellent - a lighter team-based game than Arkham Horror, Shadows Over Camelot, etc.  If the most knowledgable player doesn't mind sitting in the background and offering tips only when called on, the easy game is great fun with non-gamers.

But it's also very solo-able - provides a great tactical challenge.

Want to see how this holds up after numerous plays.  For now, it seems like a big winner.

I'll pick it up again one day, maybe it will finally click.

Pandemic isn't a bad game, I just tend to not enjoy the experience it provides. I dislike the process of discussing possible moves and debating which path is best. This is especially true with a group of new players - one must usually either insist on optimal moves, becoming THAT guy, or watching bad decisions doom the team.

With a group of veteran players that play with an open-mind toward finding the best solution, it can be a very enjoyable experience. The problem is that when I have a group of veteran players, I'm likely going to play something else instead.

This is the classic co-op!  If you are looking for a co-op, this is a great place to start.  The theme is incredibly accessible and the play is simple yet, ingenious.  

It is quite difficult for us to beat as a group and success seems to depend on the characters your group chooses.  Some combos seem inevitably doomed.  Nevertheless, we are learning to only concern ourselves with possible outbreaks, and not every cube that pops up on the board.

I really like this game and can't wait until it makes it to the table again.

If you've never played a truly cooperative game before, this is a great place to start, and easy to find too.  (Target, Barnes and Noble)

I can't find anything I don't like about this game. Good pacing and the element of surprise and the unexpected were great."

Each player doesn't play a separate game.  The way to win is for all players to share information and come up with a strategy together.  If people do their own thing, the team will lose.  Thus, the game is subject to the alpha player problem.  This is really a one player game masquerading as a 4 player game.

The game mechanism is very similar to [b][thing=15987]Arkham Horror[/thing][/b] (although the theme is much different), but in Pandemic there is more delegation and less cooperation. Everyone still works together, but it can suffer from a dictator syndrome.

Another game that got a rare 7 rating from me after one play.  Actually, after 3 plays, because we played it three times the first time I played it.  Update: after those first 3 plays, it took over a year to play again.  The 4th game was in May 2009.  Once people started bringing it to CABS (and then CABS got its own copy), it became a dime (10+ plays) in 2009.  Update several years later: I've now played it a lot and I have my own copy.  I still like it a lot, but it does seem to be more susceptible to "one player dominates the game" than other cooperative games.  Especially when you play with open cards, as we do.  But if you have closed hands, players are still allowed to talk about them, so it slows the game way down as people talk about their hands to excess.

Generally I do not like cooperative games, but this one was better than expected. Not only the game mechanics are nice, but the mood is pretty thematic. I would never give a higher number than 7 for these kind of games, so it is on the maximum.

Update: A couple of two-player games later, the game is not quite as compelling as I first thought. Still enjoyable, but I think this might hit the trade pile at some point.

Well thought-out cooperative game. Players travel around the world fighting outbreaks of diseases, all the while hoping to come up with cures.

First impression: Light in terms of rules complexity, but with meaningful decisions in most turns. Player roles are good, with each one adding something important to the game. Nicely thematic game and one which I look forward to playing again.

A great cooperative game about trying to save the world.  And who doesn't love trying to save the world?  Players work together to cure diseases that may eliminate the human race.  They have to treat disease and work together to find cures before they all die and the world is left a barren wasteland for the chimps to take over.

Stop the disease before it takes over the planet. Very simple rules to teach but it can be brutal on new players as they scramble to attempt to cure diseases as they show up while trying to find the cures.

I feel like the In The Lab expansion is almost required for the game as it adds just that much more theme and makes the card collection less of an issue. Plus moving the disease cubes around on the petri dishes is fun and feels a whole lot better than just running around trying to collect cards.

This is the new cooperative equivalent of Catan.  It's a hobby game that has "made it."  It definitely has the potential for one player to dominate the conversation, but as players gain similar amounts of experience, they're all bound to make good decisions anyway.  My girlfriend and I enjoy this one when we're looking for something with more going on than Hanabi.

RATING: 8
Pandemic is a fun co-op game that everyone (at least that I've introduced it to) loves. I definitely enjoyed it a lot the first couple times I played it too.

Thinking about it currently though, I don't really have a desire to play. Maybe I've just been in a weird mood recently, but it has definitely dropped off my radar. The in-game chaos is definitely great, but I think that the progression gets a bit old (at least to me). I really enjoy games that throw me unpredictable twists and, while the placement of the "Outbreak!" cards are somewhat unpredictable, the "Outbreak!" system is really the only bit of randomness you find.

Objectively, I can recognize that I may end up revisiting this game in a year or so, praising it for the exact reason I'm currently knocking it. However, I'm currently looking for a really expansive, complex experience (definitely not the point of Pandemic), and I think it's making me unnecessarily hard on Pandemic since I'm holding it to the standards of this yet undiscovered game.

Sorry for the ramble there though. Pandemic is a great game for just about anyone, I can recognize that for sure. It's also why I rated it an 8 and am sitting here getting frustrated with it. If you don't own it, get it. It's absolutely worth having on hand.

Nice, light co-op game, easy to teach to new people.  A bit too light and easy, though - I've won the majority of the games I've played - the most memorable games are ones when it goes down to the wire.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2011)

I like Cooperative games and the theme of Pandemic is so awesome I had no doubt I would enjoy the game. However that was not the case. I cannot say it is a bad game but I had higher expectations. For me, although the game can be very hard to beat, it still feels like a light game and a long one for what it offers.

Perhaps it is too random for my taste,  I feel no real strategy as you only react and react from the cards themselves. I´m not sure why but I don’t particularly enjoy the game, I feel Pandemic is overrated.

On the good side it is a good family game as the rules are easy to explain and have excellent player aids. 

As many friends like it, I will play again but it is not a game I will actively seek out.

Current Rating: 6.0

After another game, I’m downgrading its rating so it matches the BGG rating system with my feelings for the game. Pandemic is a game that I never want to play, but I can be convinced on occasion, so it is now a 4.5 for me. I feel there is no real strategy and the game has more uncontrollable luck that I’m comfortable with. 

There is one caveat though, I’m interested in trying the Bio Terrorist variant. 

Current Rating: 4.5

VERY boring game, the decisions are obvious 90% of the time, zero strategy. I don’t want to play this ever again so I’m rating it accordingly. Will only play with the Bio Terrorist variant.

Definitely glad I got this one. Almost a whim... walking past a game shop and "oh yeah Pandemic might be out at last (Australia) and I think people on BGG were saying good things about that one."

The variety and tension seem well woven. This is a very engaging cooperative game.

My wife and I have had several two player games of Pandemic now, and have succeeded each time to avert global disaster. (The Operations Specialist has come up for us every time and has been extremely useful.)

We've also had a three player game with my sister's non-gaming feller, and he loved it.

RATING: 7
Tense and quick.  The 45-minute timeframe was previously underserved by cooperative games.  The infection deck reseeding is plain brilliant.

The positives:  different random setups and role selections make each game a new experience.  Difficulty is easily scaled to provide a challenge for experienced and new players alike (though possibly not at the same time).

The negatives:  4-player is much, much tougher than 2-player, which is unfortunate because often the table fills.  Sometimes you get a shuffle that just isn't possible to beat.

In the end I'm sold on Pandemic, at least with 2 or 3 players.

My wife and I really enjoy this game. We have only played 2-player at this stage, and feel quite content with it. Easy is just that, fairly easy. Normal really provides a challenge, I don't think we have ever beat it completely following the rules (our first few attempts we unknowingly neglected some rules) and we have yet to attempt Hard.

I've also played this solitaire, and it still provides a good challenge. Really enjoy the game and the concept. Bought Defenders of the Realm simply because we enjoy the mechanic so much. Rate 8.5 because while I'm almost always willing for a game, I can't say I'm ALWAYS willing. Darn near close though.

This is a game where losing is better than winning. Playing with 6 Epidemics (Hard) nowadays is almost a must. I love it when the odds are against me. The most memorable game had to be one where the Outbreak marker reached 7 in the first 2-3 turns. We lasted until the very end, after discovering 3 cures, only to be defeated by a final outbreak.

What good coop game. Its refined, simple and best of all its the kind of game that gives you the sense of building up stress giving you a great feeling of urgency. You never know if you`ll win or not till the end since alot of things can happen that will turn the game around  in a down hill spiral if you dont stop it fast enough.To get the most out of this beautiful game play with people that will be able to concentrate on the game this is not a game that you can talk the whole time about other stuff. You need to have team work and organization and please if your playing with a bunch of people who are new to the game let them think for them selves and dont take over.

No game makes my stomach hurt more...we usually get down to the last few cards and just barely win.  I love the co-op play and shared victory feel.  A shared defeat is OK too.  That just makes us want to try again.  Great conversations come out of the Pandemic experience.  This is one game I wish had a bigger box! 

Own On the Brink and In the Lab.  My rating for Pandemic includes those expansions (minus the Bio-terrorist because we haven't tried that yet).  We love the added roles and special events.  In the Lab is a nail-biting different kind of puzzle.  Also own the role cards from Geekstore.

Update 9-5-16:  We now own 3 sets of Pandemic and On the Brink so we can have Pandemic parties with multiple tables.  It is hilarious as the tables shout back and forth how well the are (or aren't) doing!

Tense, fun co-operative game. Two plays only, but easily as good as Shadows over Camelot and Lord of the Rings (the two other co-op games in my collection). Less chrome, too.

Players have to work together to win, making the most of the special abilities and the cards held by the group. Play it as a concurrent series of solo games and you'll be toast.

2012-08-06 - Pandemic is a great game that is accessible to kids maybe eight to ten and older.  Almost every game has tension in it as you balance the management of regional outbreaks against compiling the cards for a cure.  The one weakness is that an A-type personality can take over the game and dictate play.

Well we ended up playing this game 9 times in one setting!  There were four of us for the first 4 games or so then we ended up adding a fifth for the remaining games.  None of us had ever played it before.  The game overall is pretty easy to pick up...think I read the manual twice and had about 90% of the game down (looked over some subtle nuances).  Probably took the rest of the group 10-15 minutes to get a good grasp of the rules and I'd say by the end of the second or thrid game anyone at the table could have taught the game with ease.  

In terms of playing we went 0-9.  I think the first three maybe four tries everyone was really into it and having a good time.  After that though I think some of the guys started to get a little pissed off at the fact that they were getting their asses handed to them by the board game and insisted on playing another game to try and save a little pride.  In the end though our efforts were fruitless and the game prevailed everytime.

For me though overall I had a great time playing in all 9 games.  The game played out quick and rules were simple enough and you really believe the first few rounds that everything is good...or that you have a fighting chance.  But I will say things sprial out of control real quick.  

I strongly recommend that people new to the game play out the introductory lvl at least once if not a couple of times before progressing.  Part of our problem was that we progressed to the heroic after the first game and of course the heroic lvl is as advertised...quite diffcult!

On a final note this game probably won't make our weekly gaming rotation mostly due to the fact that it is a co-op game.  It provides a nice change of pace for the group but we tend to be more competative with each other (I guess I mean to say that we get to much satisfaction out of kicking each others' asses).  That said though I'm sure we'll sneak it in a time or two a month!  

**Edit** Played this with the wife and she seemed intrigued with it...got multiple plays in...also the gaming group was interested in playing again...going to bump this up a little to an 8

***Edit***  Has grown a bit stale.  Suffers from a dominant person or two suggesting all the moves.  Haven't played with the expansion yet so would like to try it. Bumped down to a 6 which is probably were it will stay.

There is something about Pandemic that I can't stop recommending about to non-gamers.

Maybe it's because for a hobby game, it is widely available. Or maybe that it has many modern designs. Perhaps that the playing time is low? But I think the main reason is that when I mention that we are all cooperatively working together to fight diseases to find a cure. People get interested. After years of exposure to classic games like monopoly, life and chutes & ladders, people minds are blown to find that they are not competing with each other, but with one another.

This is an essential and a mainstay in my collection.

Not very enjoyable. The biggest problem is lack of individual responsibility. New players feel like middlemen, just moving their pawn as the other players command. If you play with anyone even slightly controlling, or even just quicker to arrive at a conclusion, you might as well not even be at the table. The cooperation part of the game sounds great on paper, but in practice, it's somewhat alienating. One person could play the whole game themselves and it'd work out just fine.

This is a game I wanted to try because of the good press it got here. It was deserving. This game was interesting and easy to understand with tension all the way through. It's the 1st game I've bought in 2 years.
Bought "ON THE BRINK" and incorporated it into this game. All plays will be recorded here.
Update: Bored. Sold the game 6/18/15 for $35 with the expansion.

The first board game I got as an adult. Introduced me into the world of board games and I haven't looked back since! I enjoy the co-operative element because I usually play 2-player games.

RATING: 9
One of my favorites -- this one is easy for non-gamers to pick up, there are lots of cool roles with interesting powers they get to use pretty frequently, and the "real world" setting makes it a teensy more accessible for them, too.  Excellent co-op game to break out for some casual fun if you've invited company over.

There is a good mixture of cooperation, skill, memory and luck in this game. This game is pretty much always a very tight, down to the wire, last turn do or die kind of game. I think it meshes together for a good experience.

RATING: 9
Very nice co-op filler.  The playtime of an hour is GREAT.  The roles, I feel, are balanced and the game is difficult to win (as a co-op should be).  Of course, there is a significant luck factor, but because the entire group is in it, it's ok to lose.  Compared to other meatier (and much longer) co-ops, this one is now my favorite simply because of the non-stop discussion this game demands.

One Year Update:

Played a few games when I first recieved Pandemic. Initail impression was absolute Positive. The game board and pieces are great. The differnt roles are all playable. Easy set up. Play flows smoothly. Plenty of interaction with fellow players. Well suited for solo play also. A big plus for me. Games are all tense and fast paced. Games last as little as 20 minutes up to almost an hour if explaining game to new players, that I seem to do often. Not many of my friends and family have ever played a co op game. 

Once I played Pandemic, I quickly ordered the expansion "On the Brink". More roles and a mutant disease, Yeah!. Also included is different Epidemic cards. Has cute petry dish to keep the different cubes in. The box is now cramp and needs to be larger now.

Said that I would get the three homemade decks from Artscow. On order as I type, one year later.

I did not play too much over the past year with Pandemic, because I was collecting way too many games. Now I have purchased almost all of the games I wanted and starting to replay past games bought. Pandemic being the first.

Still a great game. A perfect 9. 

------------initial reveiw below-------

Lives up to expectations. Incredible play. Will buy the expansion. Will buy from artscow the 3 decks that another BGG user created. Will play at the drop of a hat.

This is a pretty good game, one of the best co-op games I have played being that co-ops really aren't my thing I like this one.  The only problem I see with this game would be the people that you play it with.

**UPDATE**
changed rating from 8 to 7, co-ops just aren't my thing, because I have a problem with the "Hey what do you think I should do?" factor and also someone who thinks they know it all and trys controlling everyones moves.  Allbeit, I have only had this happen once when playing and it was the first time I played which left a bad taste in my mouth for this game.

Would like to include On the Brink expansion in the trade.  First of all, Pandemic is excellent.  Second of all, I want the new expansion.  With the new art changes and re-release, it seems silly for me to buy the new expansion and then purchase the Compatibility Pack.  I'd rather just trade my current copy and then go buy all of the new versions so that everything matches.

In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.

Players:   2, 3, 4

I really enjoyed my fist game (three players).   Although I felt pretty confident throughout, we would have lost on the next turn if we hadn't gotten the last cure.  Next time I'll be more nervous.  It's fun to cooperate and work together sometimes! Second game (two players) was also a blast.

The only co-op I can stomach and even enjoy.  Though the only win we've ever experienced we're pretty confident was because we played the game incorrectly.  Still fun.  Has stood the test of time nicely.

Great cooperative game. Really challenging. Team spirit is essential to beat the diseases. Every game is different but if you find a lack of surprise they're plenty of expansions. I can't play without The Lab anymore. If you're planning to play with unexperienced board game players maybe starting with Forbidden Island will be easier than Pandemic

Thought this was an awesome game at first.  But after a lot of plays initially, my enthusiasm for this game has gone down significantly.  It has become rather stale, and the expansions don't do a thing to help that, in my opinion.  I'd honestly rather play Shadows Over Camelot as a coop. The theme is a lot more fun, whereas Pandemic is just dry.

Great Game... Needs more ability to handle more players :P but overall I love this game... My one issue is that normally 1-2 players naturally are the decision makers and because it's co-op many new players and more passive players struggle to get to take the action they propose. It really is dependent on the party you're playing with.

Pandemic is certainly the quintessential cooperative game, but that just isn't a genre that excites me. Its merits are that it forces you to work together and is extremely challenging. As with all co-ops, the alpha player syndrome is strong, and it loses repeat playability after several rounds. That being said, I keep my copy around for the occasional play.

The best co-op game in our collection, hands down!

Placing the shuffled Infection Discard pile on top of the remaining Infection Draw pile adds quite a bit of angst to this game by giving the appearance of a relentless repeat epidemic in previously infected cities.  I like the option of determining game level during set-up with the player Draw pile too.  At the moment we're having quite a bit of fun with this, both as 2 & 3-player games.

Cooperative play stepped forward with this game, as you and your fellow players race against the deck and geography to prevent the world from being overrun with disease. Normal level is hard, and hard level is insane. It's intense, it's cooperative, it's hard to win... and it gets you to want more.

BIG PLUS: intensity, level of challenge
PLUS: ease of learning the game, geography use
MINUS: can get frustrating over time or you move on to other games

HUGE PLUS: there's an iOS version that equals the challenge

Second edition Pandemic is a big improvement. However, the expansions (especially in the lab) drastically improve this game. Every role card and scenario adds more variation. This really is the co-op among co-ops, and I highly recommend it!

Pandemic is an amazing game which scales excellently and always seems to provide an "edge of your seat" type of experience.  You always seem like you're about to win or about to lose and you're never quite sure which way it's going to go.  Players may concern themselves with alpha gamers or possible broken role combinations but for me, this one is as solid as cooperative experiences get.  Love it.

RATING: 6
A quick co-operative game where the team attempts to cure diseases. The stacked decks allow you to know approximately how many turns you can play before an epidemic which causes a city to have 3 disease cubes placed on it. The discarded infection cards are then shuffled and all put back on top of the infection deck. As a result of this it feels like a race to solve the games puzzle more so than the other co-op games I've played (Lord of the Rings and Shadows Over Camelot).

My first co-op experience, back in 2008 and I think the first game that started the whole craze of publishing co-op games. Still a great game for families and for gamers, as the difficulty can be easily scaled with the pandemic cards. The game always delivers a good tension as plenty of bad stuff happens and players try to think and work together to solve the puzzle of saving the world from a pandemic disaster.

Big thumbs down for Z-man and their [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1041390/lab-component-vs-1st-edition-components]design choice[/url] of leaving first edition owners in the cold with their release of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/137136/pandemic-lab]Pandemic: In the Lab[/url].

RATING: 7.5
Very good co-op game, with the usual strengths and weaknesses but the big advantage that it plays pretty quick.  A very good challenge which rewards further plays - the correct strategies are not obvious and the different combinations of roles really change the game.  Much better when you play with people of roughly the same experience, otherwise the most experienced player will dominate.  It IS good fun!
Update:  more plays now ... Pandemic definitely suffers LESS from the usual co-op problem of one player telling everyone else what to do.  Played a lot of LOTR co-op recently and it suffers much more from this problem, simply because its very important to know what challenges are coming up.  Pandemic is simple and discussions of tactics are pretty inclusive.  Note that it is easy to alter the difficulty level by changing the number of epidemics.
Update again:  you can play this with cards revealed but you are not allowed to talk about tactics unless you are either in the same city OR spend an action (make a phone call).  Works pretty well.

Great cooperative game.  Just as good solo as with multiple players.  The choice of Essen as one of the European countries is a nice nod to boardgamers. ;)
I had to upgrade this to 9 b/c after 7 plays I'm still eager to play it anytime, anywhere... 
Downgraded back to 8, a little burnt out on it but still a great game.
Downgraded down to 7.5.  Neat little game but I've gotten my plays worth out of it and I suddenly realized I wouldn't miss it if it left my collection.  Co-op that suffers a bit from the 'bossy player' syndrome.

Traded for Arimaa.

So far a great game.  Lots of strategy and depth of play.  Don't let the components of wood and big pawns throw you off.  The cards are excellent quality, as is the board.  The pawn and cubes are not noticeable or cared about once the game is started.  You won't care.

I like the game but not the best for our group.  For trade :(.

When this game hits the table it usually gets played at least a couple times in a row, if not more. Wins are usually down to the wire (but this may change as the group becomes more familiar with it). Losses make you want to try it again ... and again. The cooperative mechanic works so well, and the game comes at you from different angles. Tense and fun! One of those games with memorable moments you'll talk about long after.

My favorite Co-op.  Although I did not appreciate "In the Lab", the additional roles were worth the money.  With a few additional characters from any other expansion makes a good game even better.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Rated a 10 with 25+ plays (12/23/08). This is the only co-op game that allows for real teamwork, has almost zero downtime, provides lots of tough choices, and has enough built-in variability to be played again and again. An initial double-header of this is almost mandatory. Pandemic also affords some of the best two-player gaming with experienced players. 

One of the things the rulebook sort of glosses over is that player-number impacts the difficulty nearly as much as epidemic number (with 2-players being easiest). Lately my girlfriend and I have moved onto 2P6E (2-player, 6 Epidemics). We're doing fairly well. I still think my favorite way to play Pandemic is 3P5E. I've tried 3P6E, and even with clear boons of luck from the deck, it usually ends in disaster. It's been 40 or so games since I last tried though. I rarely play with four (I'd much rather play Space Alert if there are four of us), but if I do I usually keep it to 4 epidemics. More often than not, the major threat in 4P4E is running out of time. Because the cards are split four ways, I feel like the luck of the draw (cure sets) has a somewhat higher impact. Every now and then it's fun to play 5P5E (not actually "allowed" in the rules). You need that extra epidemic to make up for the fact that you have every advantage at your disposal.  

Update: An incredible game, but it's so playable and accessible and innovative and fun that it is possible to eventually 'play it out.' I'm still a big fan, but play rarely. I can't imagine downgrading it below a 9, though, having played 150 times. I'm not the one suggesting this anymore, but if an enthusiastic new player wanted me on the team, I'd be there in a heartbeat.

This is a great game for the kids and I. Move around to various cities collecting cubes that represent diseases. Then collect cards that match the disease color to cure the disease. Players take on various roles with special abilities. Even at 7 and 8 they can contribute something to the strategy. My 8 year old always wants to play the medic. This character does seem to shift the game balance slightly  in our favor. We had a streak of several close losses, so I looked up more strategies on BGG. I think the following helped. After an epidemic stack any threes into a pyramid. They are more likely to outbreak sooner than a newly created three. Put research stations near regions that have the most infections. Do not discard more than four cards of a single color. We had our best game ever following these rules.

This was an instant hit.  It's a tense game that can certainly spiral out of your reach and it feels like you're always missing something which makes it a heck of a challenge but a heck of a lot of fun as you try to balance everything.

I was completely unsure of how a cooperative game would go over but I'm a total convert to the Pandemic bandwagon.

We've tried it with extended family to great success!

This is the game that brought me to BGG. Catan was the gateway drug and this game was the first 'real' hardcore game. I love that I don't always win and that it's a challenge every time. I never knew Co-op was a thing before this game. While I still prefer playing against other players, this is a great departure from the normalcy of competition. Highly recommend to people that want to do more than just play Monopoly

This is the ultimate coopertative boardgame!  It's fun having players work as a team--trying to erradicate diseases--looking @ each others' hands, planning the next move in conjuction with other players' future actions.  It's brilliant; it's beautiful in execution--what's not to like?  & on top of that, you can get more than one game in a group session before it's time to turn out the lights & call it a day.  Love this game!

Simple enough to be a gateway with enough strategic decision making to make gamers happy. Wonderful escalation mechanics. Almost always a hit. Great theme. Just getting to the point where I want expansions, but don't want to repurchase base game. May be bumped back by Legacy (Legacy board for expansions?) when I can play that. EDIT: Oh yeah, Legacy is AMAZING. And if you unsticker the board it can absolutely be used for base Pandemic with or without expansions (though you will need to buy or mock up new core Role Cards). I have now traded away my base copy and use the Legacy board for all my Pandemic needs.

After playing some today, one of the guys commented that at the end of a won game, it feels a little anti-climatic.  I can see where he is coming from.  There are no moments that feel exciting.  I never want to say "Man, when you went to Milan and Essen to cure those diseases, that was really cool."

RATING: 7
My wife loves this game and gets a lot of satisfaction in going for complete eradication of all four diseases.  Game length is great.  Cooperative game play is a big plus.  Easy to explain to new players but doesn't seem to lose its appeal over time.  Love the map and the colourful disease cubes.  We like to move the starting research station to our own real life location.  Haven't played any of the expansions as we didn't want to lose the cooperation with a bio terrorist and haven't been convinced we needed an expansion.  Just got Pandemic Legacy for Christmas though!

I've tried this a number of times and I just don't enjoy it.  It's subject to far too much quarterbacking and takes too long for what it is.  This isn't my kind of puzzle... or it is, but I don't want to spend the game choosing between planning out four people's "optimal" moves, or playing sub-optimal choices.  I don't have this problem with Forbidden Island, which is basically the same thing but smaller.

I'm still open / curious about the Legacy edition, though, and have enjoyed my one or two plays of the dice chucking version (Pandemic: The Cure).

This game is as good as the hype. The short duration will lead to "just another game". So far it wasn't a problem that one player dominates the game and I can imagine that in a good game group that problem will not arrive at all.

It's hard for me to review this since I played it after Forbidden Island (I know Pandemic came out years before). I like the game and my mom (a nurse) really got into it. But the core mechanic of collecting sets of cards felt stale. Spending my whole turn moving to trade a card is a letdown. And the event cards weren't very different from Forbidden Island. And the game cost twice as much. But I do like the game. I'm hoping to get On the Brink and maybe that will add a little more depth to push it farther from Forbidden Island.

The only cooperative game I own so far, and I love it. There can be a bit of over-powering depending on who you play with, but I've gotten adept at shutting that down. It's such a well thought-out game and the theme fits the mechanisms perfectly. And it can really be challenging, which is important to me in a cooperative game. When you win, it really feels like an achievement, but when you lose, you really feel like you messed it up, which makes you want to go back for another. Great game.

RATING: 8
Easy to learn co-op game, but a little abstract/dry. My fiancée loves it for the theme, however, so it is frequently her recommendation of what to play. As a two-player game, the difficulty is all over the place depending on what roles you get, leading to some very easy games and some very tough ones. Unfortunately, even with perfect play, some games just cannot be won, which I think is a fault in the design.

Rated as a 6 because 5 just seems a little too harsh for what is a well-designed multiplayer cooperative puzzle that just doesn't do a whole lot for me. I can sometimes have an enjoyable experience around it if it's not overthought or dominated by an alpha player, but I have a hard time escaping the idea that, like Joshua and tic-tac-toe, you could have a computer play this against itself over and over in order to realize that the only winning move is not to bother to play what is largely a mechanistic efficiency exercise.

I have only played this game solo {playing 2 roles at a time} I won on my 4th play. This is an excellent solo game and I'm sure just as good as a multi-player game. It plays very fast which is a big plus for me and does a decent job simulating it's theme. It is luck driven with the cards but you really have to think your moves out so hand management is crucial. Still, a bad mix of player cards and an equally bad mix of infection cards will almost guarantee a loss. The other cool thing is a built in difficulty level so if you find yourself winning to often on easy bump it up a level.

This was the first modern board game I bought, and my wife and I really enjoy it. It doesn't get played that often, but whenever we do play it, I always end up thinking, "This is a really good game." We have also played it with both sets of non-gamer parents and it went over really well. When we set it up for my mother-in-law she said, "I don't think I like this kind of game." However, after we finished (and lost) our first game she said, "OK, I get it now. Let's play again."

Pandemic is great. Fairly easy teach, nearly universal appeal, and good mechanics. Intense moments when you're late in the game and on the cusp of losing.

(In US) A well-balanced cooperative game that is not too stacked against the players, but is not a push-over either. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Number of players: 2-5

Components: (8)
They're simple but work wonderfully. The diseases are represented by wooden cubes. The cards are high quality. All the artwork is simple, but looks nice.
  
Rules: (10)
The rules are well written and easy for everyone to understand. 

Setup: (10)
The set up is easy enough as long as you make sure to shuffle all the cards very well. You'll deal a certain number of cards to each player, then deal out cards to place initial diseases on the board.

Area required to play: (10)
Most everything will fit on the board. You will need a little area to set the diseases that are not yet in play. Every player will hold a hand of cards.
 
Fun: (9)
This is really one of my favorite games. It's the first co-op that I ever played, and I wasn't sure that I would like playing against the game as much as I enjoy playing against other people. I sure did like it, though!

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (8)
This game is about diseases spreading across the globe and the players desperate attempt to cure and eliminate them. I think the theme is wonderful and the mechanics work for the theme. It's mostly skipping around the board to various locations to avoid outbreaks with an emphasis on hand management and set collection. You're not very aware of that when you're playing, though. You're thinking about how to cure those terrible diseases.

Replay Value: (7)
I never tire of this game. If you do (I don't know how) add in On the Brink and play it again!

Storage: (6)
I made tuck-boxes for the cards, which helped. Also, On the Brink adds trays for the diseases while is a plus. Without these things, storage for the game isn't the best. When you buy On the Brink, you'll have two boxes. The components from the expansion will not all fit back in the base box.

Accessibility: (10)
This game is super easy to teach and enough fun to keep everyone engaged.

A great game to play, but I've had more and more problems with it as the game began to feel less of a game and more of a puzzle that was quite solvable with enough thought. This leads to a big, big problem of someone quarterbacking the game.

I'm surprised at how popular this game has been.  I think the theme is somewhat new and enjoyable, but the actual mechanisms themselves seem no different than other cooperative games that exist.  The main benefit this game has is its short play time, which means that I would play this over Shadows over Camelot any day.  But still, playing against the game system just isn't too much fun for me.

RATING: 7
A coop game where players are trying to save the world from 4 deadly viruses. Its a good and surprisingly simple game which almost anyone can pick-up easily. The mechanics are streamlined and the epidemic and outbreak system is well implemented.

Unfortunately the simplicity of the game means that it lacks flavor. There is no distinguishing factor for the diseases. They all act the same way and have no names. And because of that, I don't see this game having much replayability.

In short, a fun family game but one which will probably not really appeal to hardcore gamers.

Easily the most played game in my collection by a large margin, to the point where it's a shame to have this requested.

But I cannot fault its design and the ice breakers this offered me within the various groups I entered.

The only thing holding back Pandemic from higher ratings is it's replayability. It's more-ish but then slightly repetitive in the long term.

One of the cooperative games. There are not much of them. The game catches the players very easily and it feels really awful to loose it. However, it is not that easy to win. The most important thing is to spot through all the epidemics and outbreaks, when the card stack is depleted, because this simply means the end of the game.

I like the idea of a cooperative game, but it seems like coop games are prone to having one guy run the whole thing or that player's "cheat" by communicating too much to win the game.  I don't see that this game solves either problem.  On the other hand, it is fairly short, and it has some interesting elements.

After 15 plays in two days, I upgraded the ratings to an 8.  It is addictive, my wife wants to play over and over again, and it poses some interesting logistical problems.

After 200+ plays.  I upgraded the ratings to a 9.  It is a great solitaire puzzle.  Besides playing over 200 games with my wife, I have probably played more than 200 with the Pandemic iOS app.

This game is hard to win. Which I think is a good thing, and what keeps me coming back. You have to have the right group of people to play it though.

I can see why people like this but it is not for me. The vast majority of games I like have an element of game theory. This is a joint solitaire game of playing against a system. I like talking with others but I would rather do it with something else. I would probably prefer a cooperative game that involved two competing teams. That said, Pandemic is short enough that I'll participate if others really want to play it. I'll never suggest it though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A solid, solid coop, just deep enough to sink our teeth in it, and just simple enough that we can focus on the puzzle, rather than the rules. A challenge, and a cool experience. As Zee Garcia says, the best part of the game is that moment at the end where we all stop, and go "if you do this and this and that and this, and then I do this and go there and cure twice, and then...", and then someone goes "no, if you do that we'll run out of card", and then someone goes "oh, but I have this special card!". It's a great puzzle to solve as a team.

Co-operative games are not my favorite genre but this is my favorite of the group.  It has a completely unique theme and is truly cooperative.  The game difficulty is well designed with the initial level winnable the majority of the time and the most difficult level nearly impossible to win.  This game can suffer from a dominant personality though.  
This game could almost certainly get a 10 rating if my non-gamer wife likes it and as of Aug 2016 she had her first play and enjoyed it.

Hasnt really seen a lot of plays lately.  I havent purchased anymore cooperative games since it seems the group (and I) prefer a little more competitive atmosphere.  I still like this game though, and it requires some thought as you play, which I really appreciate.

Solid cooperative game that feels very challenging.  There are a number of things you need to be doing and it always seems that just as you're close to putting out a fire here, another one flares up over there.

I really like Pandemic as a piece of design and as an experience, though I have to repeat the warning that is standard with the game: Pandemic is supremely enjoyable with an evenly matched set of players, but can be deeply unenjoyable if one player runs the show.

I was that one player in a game with my partner and a few others, and now she strongly dislikes the game because she didn't feel free to act and decide and think for herself—which is completely understandable, and I feel awful for having ruined the game for her.

So, yes—fair warning. Play with people of about your skill level, and if you feel yourself turning into a quarterback, for the love of gaming and keeping people interested, hold yourself back.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Really needs the expansions to reach its full potential, but a very fun game. It does not work as a gateway game for us since, unless playing with people with similar experience, it's too easy to just play for someone else.

The central mechanic of putting back the  cards when the epidemic cards are drawn is clever, and the theme evokes a certain urgency. Still, for a solo/cooperative game I think I'd personally prefer a different theme, e.g. Ghost Stories. Maybe you could re-theme it.

If Forbidden Island opened the door to co-operative gaming for my wife and I, Pandemic pulled us right in and hooked us.  We love this game even in two player, but we'll always bring this with us when visiting family.  

The co-operative nature is excellent and the challenge of balancing the strategy of treating diseases and coming up with the cure is a lot of fun.  We loved it so much that we have added all the expansions so we can pick, choose, and combine what game types we want to play.  We even have the custom box from Broken Token to store it all.  We play this game at least a couple of times a week and looking forward to our next challenge with Pandemic Legacy.

Incredible cooperative game that everyone seems to have enjoyed thus far. The wooden cubes are a wonderfully abstract way of showing viruses. I like this one a lot and will likely play it more solitaire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
The rules are simple, concise and clear, with few if any ambiguities. Game play is fluid, and there is considerable interaction between the players with the right group. There is one way to win and there are 3 ways to lose the game, and each of the 3 seems to occur with roughly equal frequency, which means that players must pay attention to three different countdowns. It's agreeably hard to beat, and the level of difficulty is easily adjusted to the level of experience of the players. 

The mechanics - in particular the mechanism for intensifying threat - are familiar from Forbidden Island, but better implemented with a cascade mechanism that adds a little piquancy to the game.

The game is vulnerable to the alpha gamer, and there are no individual goals that might have mitigated that. In the groups I've played with this has not been an issue, so it may be more theoretical than real. 

While the cards and the jewel-like viruses are excellent, I'm less keen on the bland anonymous pawns, some of whose colours are difficult to distinguish in low light. I've replaced mine with small figurines that make it easier for players to find their avatar easily on the board. 

I would recommend this game without reservation to anyone new to boardgames.

RATING: 5
After a bunch of plays, I have to conclude I don't like Pandemic. It was OK at first when both myself and my partner were getting to know it, but it was all downhill after we both decided we knew best what the next move was. 

I listened to Tom Vasel's podcast extolling this sort of game last year, in which he suggested that players who don't like take orders should just develop a stronger personality, but you can't win this without extensive discussion and strategy sessions. And in those, you're going to take orders a lot of the time, or issue them. You might talk and talk and talk everything out, but that gets boring and eventually someone has to make a call. Simple as that. 

I think I just hate games that have subordinates built into the rules. I don't play games so that I can outsource my already meagre decision-making capacity to others. 

This is ingenious and fun and an innovative, interesting design - but only insofar as everyone agrees, and as soon as that stops happening, prepare to be either bored or angry.

The board is about a 3, though. The cards are substantial, which helps, but the colors of the pieces don't really match those of the roles. Plus, that sunburst graphic, and the silly looking Hairy Virus around the title? If you're going to put out board games, spend more than half an hour learning how to handle photoshop, eh?

But hey, it set me back £24.99. Not bad.

A game that has consistently kicked mine and my groups ass over and over.  Maybe I'm bad at the game, and maybe we're all just collectively idiotic, but I've never won a single game of this game.  However, we all universally agree that the game is fantastic and all it does is harden our resolve to play it again till we do win.  This is a game that is short and light enough to play multiple times a night, and considering how infuriating a loss is, you can be sure that you'll need those extra playthroughs.

Back in 2008 this game was far more innovative and interesting. However, the increase in the number of co-op games released in the last near decade has caused the sheen of Pandemic to fade a bit. If you're going to own a version of Pandemic, pick up Pandemic: Legacy to add some replay-ability to a somewhat bland original game.

Pandemic is a great game. I like playing it with others, especially those who are sporadic gamers. This is one of the games that drew me into the hobby. But as my gaming tastes have evolved, this is not a game that I find myself wanting to play. This is true for most cooperative games. If I rated this objectively it would be an 8 or a 9, but if I rate this to include my own personal interest in playing relative to other games, it is about a 6 and maybe lower.

This is my first board game. I played this at a rpg convention and my eyes opened to the board game scene. It has been 3 years since then and I love playing games more than ever. In this game the tension is growing slowly and then when an epidemic card is drawn it is just a matter of time before outbreaks happen and the game gets out of control. I love the asymmetric tension this mechanic provides. Other than that the hand management aspect is fine but nothing revolutionary. I also like the fact that every character has a fun special ability, when you are the medic you feel good if you clean 3 cubes with an action. Overall, I really like this game and recommend it to people starting their collections and looking for a good filler.

2014-02-13 - Very good game. Looking forward for expansions. It helped me a lot with solo games, which I played when couldn't organise regular meeting for some time.

2014-09-03 - 8 -> 8,5. Definitely the best coop I played so far.

2014-11-01 - 8,5 -> 10. The more I play it the more i like it! Now, with On the Brink, I have more characters and more variants and I can't wait for In the Lab to be released in Poland.

2017-07-31 - 10->8 - Pandemic Legacy has worn out this for me - I didn't play since ending the campaign. Still I consider this to be a very good game.

In theory, I really like this came. Love the coop aspect, enjoy the theme.  But -- and I know this is weird -- the game seriously *stresses me out.* My husband laughs, but I get all nervous and anxious about whether we'll win.  I can't even sit down for the game.  I'd play it more often if it felt just a little calmer.

A cooperative game that most anyone can enjoy.  The theme is very accessible, since not everyone likes fantasy, Cthulhu or space themes.  One of the easiest games to get on the table because intimidated players are comforted with the cooperative gameplay.  Just be sure to smack around any alpha-gamers that try to take over the table and run everyone's turn.  I have the original version, which is mildly annoying, because the latest expansion is incompatible without some sort of upgrade pack you need to buy.  Grrr.

RATING: 6
This game sorta suffers like Castle Panic...  Although harder, it is still a co-op game with a lot of dictation.  It "is" fun, but just not as fun as competitive play.  There are a lot of things I like, but I feel it is mostly in spite of the things I don't.

I've only played this game with the expansion, but since I only use the pawns and new role cards from the expansion, I don't really consider playing the old game with it because nothing has changed.

I LOVE the roles and the powers they provide.  I love the research centers and the teamwork needed to do spread and conquer.  Still, what I don't like is the lack of satisfaction and climax at the end of the game.

When you win, you feel like you should high five everyone around the table, but it really doesn't come up...  I like the game from the components to the theme, but it just misses the flare when you actually get INTO the game...

I personally think this game by itself should be a 7 at least...  Making it a solid game I would play but not suggest.  However, because of this game and the lack of excitement I get out of it, it has put me off from buying Defenders of the Realm because of it...  I've been eyeing that game for a while and am saddened by this experience so much I've decided to hold off on that purchase and its expansion for the time being...

Seeing as how this game is a more advanced co-op game, I was hoping it would push me TOWARDS a purchase of Defenders of the Realm...  However, because it did the exact opposite, I have to score it a point less at 6 because it has pretty much turned me away from the co-op genre at least for now...

Pandemic is essentially a well-themed multiplayer puzzle.  That's not a bad thing, per se - I definitely enjoy it very much.  But it does mean there isn't a lot of individualization or feeling of immersion.  I prefer my co-ops to be epic and involved.

Also, I realize this doesn't actually matter, but why oh why can't the piece colors match the role colors???

The theme and mechanics work extremely well together.

I feel like this jump-started the cooperative genre again. However, it doesn't do a good enough job of overcoming the cooperative problem of "the best strategy is to have a single player call all the shots." It tries to fix this by limiting information transfer (other players shouldn't know what cards you have), but this limiting rule is followed with varying degrees of dismissal, depending on the gaming group.

Played a couple times more and still can't get too excited, it's a good, short, coop game, but suffers from serious solution problems. Group-think can be a bad thing, and this shows it full force. The game is fun, but the path is so deterministic.

I wanted to bump up the rating since the last game we narrowly won was exciting, but I can't help but think that I would want the opposite had we lost.

Player's ability to win isn't determine by how well they play but by the randomness of the card draws. Poor performance can lose the players the game, but winning is pure luck.

This is a great "family" game, in a sense... it's not as light as a party game - there's plenty of strategy.  And the rules aren't as easy to explain as say, Ticket to Ride - but it is a pretty simple game to play.  That is NOT to say it's easy!  It's very hard.  The theme and mechanics work really well together, and it's a lot of fun.  Recommended!

Update:  Many, many plays now.  Kind of flat, and tends to be like a 1 player game that is played by committee.

Update:  After playing many other coops, Pandemic is still the best.

The Good: A really good coop game. Plays just fine solo, as well. Rules are pretty easy to learn, and game plays pretty fast, a little over an hour. All this, and you also learn some geography. Components are very nice. This game is also a big challenge to win. Great tension as you draw cards to see if another outbreak has occurred !

The Bad: My board is warped. It may be that the strategy will wear thin after a few games, but even if this happens, it is so much fun I suspect I would contine playing.

Initial rating based on solitaire play to learn rules.

Purchased as a gateway game primarily to interest my wife (an epidemioligist) in playing something other than Cranium and Scrabble.  There's a very nice balance between mechanics and theme. The game seems to be very finely balanced to provide a good challenge with the increasing rates of infections as epidemics come up and the players' abilities to find cures.  Each turn provides players with many choices, and with the random spread of diseases and special events it looks like each game will play differently.

I don't know how to comment on this game. If I had never played Shadows over Camelot, I would think this is brilliant. It still is, but at the same time it borrows so heavily from SoC that it is hard to consider it all that original. It has some real plusses by comparison -- it is much easier to explain to a new player, and it has essentially the same game experience in a shorter timeframe. On the other hand, it's pretty bland to look at and I never would have tried it if someone else hadn't brought it to game night.

Further plays have actually increased my opinion and enjoyment of the game, even though I think the outcome is primarily decided by the card draws.

After all these years I'm still torn on my opinion of Pandemic.  On one hand I cannot like it that much as I've sought out many a replacement be it Defenders of the Realm or even something like Zombie State.  In the end though I've lost interest in those alternatives while still not disliking Pandemic.  I think perhaps my issue is in not having liked Pandemic quite enough to have explored the expansions to which I hear the On the Brink one can be considered quite essential.  Perhaps it didn't exist back when I played it with others who were far bigger fans (and perhaps we suffered too much from Alpha Gamers bossing us around at the time!).

I do know that the base game by itself I don't really prefer vs. Forbidden Desert which also has similar role cards and cooperative mechanics.  My wife also finds the theme of Pandemic very morbid while our son tolerates it when I explain it differently.  I do prefer certain things about Pandemic in the way outbreaks occur and are managed but, at least in the 3 player game, we've found it hard to eradicate a cured virus altogether such that it almost seems not worth the effort.

Overall I think there is now a permanent place for it in our collection though, along with Pandemic Lite (Forbidden Desert) and a Pandemic Thematic (Currently looking at Defenders of the Last Stand).  So I'm hoping to think more highly of Pandemic once I acquire some expansions and view it as more of an Advanced Game version.

Odd to find a place for 3 different versions of the same game in a collection when none of them are particularly my favorite but I guess over time the pandemic sort of gameplay has become not unlike worker placement or deck building or something like that which is easily something you'd have a few different versions of even if not quite your favorite thing.

I really like the new box cover art for the entire Pandemic series.  Nice job there.  The current editions bits looks really great as well and the card quality is perfect.  I think that might have helped my opinion of the game a little bit.

The first co-op game in my collection, and a rather enjoyable one at that.  The game is compelling and rather tense (especially with all of the epidemic cards).  My only complaint is in regards to the size of the disease cubes and research stations.  They completely cover up cities on the board.  Like [GameID=878], it's another title that I didn't know would be such a hit with my wife and friends.

Played twice, lost twice but in the second go we were doing better than the first, which I think shows we were getting a grip on strategy.

As a four player co-operative game it is basically a solo game which is split up for multi-player.

There is a lot of luck in the shuffle and draw of the cards but it plays pretty fast so you can try again quickly.

There is a fun dimension to co-operative games as you have to decide strategy by argument and persuasion.

We won our last game. I think we were fairly lucky with the cards.

An excellent game that captures its theme very well.  Players work together to cure all four major diseases before they destroy the world's population.  Pandemic is very challenging but still fun, and can accomodate from 1-4 players.  There is a nice balance between the different abilities, and the infection mechanic is just brilliant.  It's also highly replayable and quick, usually finishing in around 20-35 minutes.  It's the best game of 2008, and one of my only perfect 10's!

An outstanding coop. Have not yet run into people that didn't enjoy this game. It starts out seeming to be an abstract exercise in puzzle-solving, but somewhere mid-game, it becomes an immersive race against the outbreaks that people genuinely get wrapped up in.

:star::star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar::nostar: [b]5 plays June 2013[/b]

I played this few times with different groups of players but it never worked well. This game allowed me to realize that I don't like multiplayer co-op games at all. To me, co-op games are just dull as I feel like I'm just watching somebody else is playing or I'm playing and there is someone always tells me what to do next. In addition, my wife is also extremely against this game so this will never be played in my house.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pandemic isn't a bad game at all. The board is great, as usual with a Z-Man game. I just found that this game had some problems. First, each character is a one-trick pony, which makes gameplay repetitious. As with most co-op games, there really isn't much to it. It's a matter of bean-counting and lucky draws. And on top of that there is one fatal flaw: the most experienced player tends to dominate the game, telling everyone else what they need to do. This minimizes its enjoyment, even as a co-op game.

Generally I like cooperative games and Pandemic is one of my favorites.  Though the difficulty level is adjustable, I find its normal play perfectly balanced. Typically my group wins narrowly, but we have recorded a loss or two, which is just enough to keep us humble. 

Word of advice, Pandemic does not play well with all groups, much like any cooperative game. This game relies on interaction and communication among the players. Each person should be invested in trying to win. Passive players, quiet players, and players who have only a half interest in playing will dull the experience.  Don't play this game with those people.  Otherwise, you will be playing for both of you.

It's a modern classic for a reason. This coop was groundbreaking in its challenging but still streamlined and quite intuitive mechanics.
The best parts are probably:
* The outbreak mechanic, which has been copied by numerous other coops.
* The way epidemics work is ingenious (in an evil way).
* How powerful the different roles are, and how well they work in combination.
For four newbies it didn't feel that easy even with just four epidemic cards, but I guess it'll get better with experience.

First cooperative play game I've tried and I liked it!  We won one and lost one on the "regular" setting (5 epidemic cards).  There is some tension in the game as there is usually more things to do then you have actions.  Replayability is good due to different starting situations for each game.  The reinfection mechanic of shuffling the discards and placing them on top of the draw pile is something I hadn't seen before and integrates the theme nicely.  For a challenge play with more players and higher difficulty level.

No of players: solo/2
Co-operative game that sets (right from the beginning) bar really high in this genre.
By using clever mechanisms for changing pace between good, bad and ugly situation on the board, it still gives player filling that nothing is lost until the end.
Instead of just going downhill from one point, it is more like roller coaster all the time. 
More often than not, you'll be in situation to say: "We needed just one more turn, that's all". 
Different roles, event/epidemic/city cards almost ask you to push your luck to the very limit in combination with smart tactic decisions.
Excellent game.

For me it is ultimate solo experience. Fantastic game, my personal number 1 and one of the rare games I simply refuse to play cooperatively (it's just a personal preference, for me it feels like a puzzle I want to solve alone). It takes me between 30-45 minutes (with setup) to play full game controlling 3 or 4 characters (with 6 pandemic cards) which is additional plus.

A cooperative game where the players work together to find cures to four rampantly spreading diseases before the world is overwhelmed. 

This game definitely has some luck in it but for such a quick game it offers an impressive mix of opportunities for long term planning, short term tactics, risk taking and cooperative play. My wife and I really enjoy this best as a two player game where we can work together to solve a problem and save the world. It is also good with more players (so long as you don’t have a dominant personality making everyone’s decisions).

Good cooperative game with set collection as goal. When a disease really gets out of control, then it gets pretty tough to beat the system! The success rate depends on the speed of the epidemic cards, the initial set-up and the closeness of the new infections. Played four times - lost twice & won twice. We lost the very first game, immediately tried a second time and were successful!

My favorite co-op game by far. It'll be a game that I keep coming back to for sure. The only downside is the common co-op problem of one person dictating things to everyone else, but this may not necessarily be an issue with your game group.

Currently my favorite Coop. With the On the Brink addon, you can scale the difficulty anywhere from very easy to humanly impossible, which is very important for a coop in my opinion.

Amazing co-operative game, which works just as well with 2, 3 or 4 players. The challenges are different though, because you have more roles (advantages) at your disposal at 4, but it becomes a little harder to discover the medicines (which is your goal). Nevertheless great game and nice if you want to work together to beat the game and diseases. Difficulty is also adjustable by placing more or less epidemic cards in the game.

Bardzo dobra optymalizacyjno-kooperacyjna gra planszowa :).

Świetny mechanizm wybuchania epidemii połączony z koniecznością przewidywania przez graczy, co najgorszego może się wydarzyć. Wbrew pozorom bardzo klimatyczna.

Niestety silnie występuje problem "lidera", gdzie jeden z graczy przejmuje rolę głównodowodzącego i narzuca innym graczom, co powinni robić. Jednak jeżeli gracze mają choć odrobinę chęci do kooperacji to gra się przyjemnie i wszyscy się skupiają nad tym, czy nic nie zostało przeoczone w próbach zwalczania światowych pandemii.

Zdarzają się słabe rozgrywki, ale zazwyczaj gra trzyma w napięciu prawie do samego końca.

Amazing Cooperative game that leaves you wanting to play again, mainly because you lost last game....  It provides a unique challenge integrating ideas to find the best possible solution to a hoard of overwhelming problems.
If you are playing this game right (several small rules often go unnoticed), it's EXTREMELY difficult!  I have played 60+ Times and won only about 20 of those!
Luck does play a small part in this game, but most problems can be foreseen...

In spite of the hyping of this game, if you have an experienced player he just overtakes the whole gameplay. After a game or 4 i think you won't play it again.

-1 takes up too much table space
-1 it is not so exciting: either nothing much is going on or it is clear that everyone is going to die regardless.
-1 for what you get it takes too long to finish
-1 thematically not great, doctors that teleport all over, camps being built, the character you play does not feel right.
-1 takes much time to set up. The 30 minutes lower bound is a lie.

I'm a very competitive person who enjoys competing, and i thought i would hate this game due to the lack of competition. I was however pleasantly surprised and this game opened up my eyes to coop games. This is now as it stands my go-to game to play if board game nights are suggested. I just love the interaction between players and the team spirit of winning (and losing) together.

Update 2:
This game needs a certain crowd. After playing a two player game. My opponent said he would like to play in teams against each other???  
Clearly this is no such game. If you don't like games where the object is that of defeating the game. Stay away. If you do like such type of games it is one of the best.



Update: Played for a third time a 3P game
What a difference a little rule can make.
I rated it before a 7 (it felt like a 6 but I knew something was wrong)
Upgraded it to an 8.


Important epidemic take the bottom card from the draw pile.


First two games.
Played one rule wrong. In order to eradicate disease you have to go to cities with cubes of that disease an treat them. The action of treating will take one action. So a player can eradicate disease in 2 towns in one turn.
the medic only has to visit the city to automatically cure the disease once when the cure has been found. This works well with the dispatcher.


Only when the final cure is found there is no need for eradication. You win the game automatically.

There is an excellent one page summary of the rules made by Universal head to be found here.

Cooperative gameplay at its best.  Adapts well to groups of different sizes. The mechanics are smart, direct, and malleable to different strategies. Relatively simple to teach to newcomers, and the difficulty can be increased or decreased to accommodate player experience levels.  Games tend to play out organically, making no two games too much alike.  Quality components.

Nearly a perfect game that is very challenging, but rewarding. Simple enough to teach to new players.  Tons of replay value.

It's a cooperative which usually means, inactive evening where the strongest personality dominates what everyone else does. I have fun with it though and of the three cooperative games in our group (Arkham and Camelot being the others) this has the most replayability considering it's insanely quick set up and play. Not sure it's a rush out and buy but it is a definite keeper to our group's collection.

Wedding gift! :-)

After finally playing it, Pandemic disappointed me very much... There was nothing really interesting during the whole game. No tension, no atmosphere, no need to use your brain. We will give it a try again, but I was expecting muuuuch more.

...

The above applies to the easy option - don't play it. It's just useless. Normal and hard options are just right and quite fun -> rating goes form 5 up to a decent 7.

Down to 6.9 - there should be something that distinguishes players' turns and make them more unique for the current player and only for him. With current rules one player can take the leadership and play the whole game for the others.

Math trade acquisition, didn't have high hopes but I was interested in finding out how it plays. There is a certain desperate feeling it succeeds in evoking for such an abstract game, but doesn't feel like I'd want to play this too much.

I don't have prior experience with euroish co-ops like this so maybe some similar games address the problem, but generally there should be some information you have to keep to yourself to quell the alphaplayer syndrome. I find it a pretty stupid ruling that you're not supposed to play with open cards, but can ask others what they have at any time. What's that for other than prolonging the game for no reason?

Given the high rating it probably is a good family game, but there's nothing really here for gamers, at least without the expansions. Those I could try at some point.

A good pure coop that got me back into board games.

Difficult as hell, but manageable if players around are on point.  As with any pure coop game, the game can degenerate into a single player dictating who goes where and does what.  I can see why some options are clearly better than others as it's somewhat built in the design of the game that if you don't go to said destination, then you're going to pay for the consequences.  So in some ways, it may feel "scripted".  But the drawn event cards do give some added chance into the game to make it different from play to play.

I think we've gotten it managed to a point where players will give advice when asked/needed.  That way players can feel like they are individually contributing to the team.

The king of this style coop game. It *feels* like the the mechanics are closely tied with the theme in spite of the reality that the game is very abstracted. (What do your cards represent exactly?  They're used for both travel and for researching cures.)  It can be cinematic, it can be tense. It's filled with discussion about what to do.  The different powers play off each other in interesting ways. You feel like a group of heroic researchers saving the world!

6/26/14:  Works great solo as well!

RATING: N/A
In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.

Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!

► Best cooperative gateway game.

The essential cooperative board game and also one of the very best gateway games in general.

[b]Pandemic[/b] has one of the cleanest and most compact yet clever game designs I ever encountered. It still amazes me how much this game offers, considering the few components and rules this game actually has (including an adjustable difficulty). Brilliant.

The theme is also quite unique, interesting and something most people can get into, further enhancing the game's gateway factor.

I love me some Pandemic, but the original is simply not as good without expansions. There are too few roles to play so the games get way too samey after awhile. The Event Cards are also a grab bag. This with On the Brink would probably be a 10, but my big problem is that buying those two is a $60+ proposition, and you're simply not getting $60 worth of game here. That's Legacy money! Now that On the Brink is becoming hard to find, Z-Man needs to just add all the cards to this game. Then it would shoot up to the 10 it deserves to be.

Luck-driven co-op game where experienced players will instruct you what the "correct" move is on your turn. Exceedingly boring and dry with predictable outcomes. Like a worse version of shadows over camelot.

RATING: 9
I love this game. The first co-operative game I've played so the style was new to me. You and your teamates compete against the 4 different diseases that start breaking out over the planet. You work collectively, trying to exchange cards to get one person with 4 cards of the same color disease(diseases are yellow, blue, black, and red) and cure them. This isn't easy, as with each turn, more diseases (card driven) keep popping up and before you know it, epidemics are breaking out all over and eventually your team of experts just can't hold it back. Very cool game.

Estoy completamente enganchado a Pandemic, es el mejor cooperativo que he probado. Imprescindible en cualquier colección de juegos, y su expansión On the Brink también, aunque el modo de juego con Bioterrorista no es demasiado bueno. Tras varias partidas con In the lab, puedo decir que la expansión no mejora el juego, pero lo modifica lo bastante como para convertirlo en nu evo reto, y qué reto... más complicado todavía.

This is such a addictive coop game! One of the best coop games ever.

I love how the game is set up differently each time, we had games that finished quickly because the game started with the infected cities so close to each other combined with the unfortunate draw of a epidemic card in our second turn. We ended up failing during the first few turns. And then other times our turn/move plans and card draws went so well that we beat the game in only half of what a normal game would take. 

Luck is major factor in gameplay but it is what it is, I like to think that's just how a real world epidemic would have played out. This doesn't diminish how fun this game is, careful planning with minimal wasted move definitely works fine if the cards are not too too bad.

Really love the fact that all players work together to beat a game. So satisfying when flipping over that last vassel and cheers to victory together!

The components and the graphic design are great as well, it's a must have for any modern board gamers.

(Owned Pandemic base game and "On the Brink" expansion. Looking to get some other expansion in the future.)

Several games.  A true co-operative game.  I'm not the biggest fan of co-op games, mostly because of how they usually devolve into one player, usually the most experienced, directing the other players.

As far as coop games go, this is pretty nice.  The issue I have is that I have never "lost", so it could be harder.  The other thing is that the best/most efficient course of action isn't very difficult to figure out, so the game becomes "explain and convince the other players to do the right thing".  This actually works as a solo game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In overall the game is interesting and there are some interesting new mechanics. For example, the discard pile which get reshuffle on the top of the infection deck.

Personally, I find that the game ends in the middle of the action. I don't know but I think that when you have all 4 cure, there are still possibilities to have outbreak that will make your life harder. Personally, I would have made sure that you must eradicate a certain number of disease to win the game.

Finally, the role special abilities are almost all useful, maybe perhaps the dispatcher, but I think that if there is no researcher or scientist in the game, it will be really hard to win the game. Because you can only win by finding all 4 cures and those 2 roles are only only ones which helps researching a cure.

Strong game.  Much tension and the theme really fits the game.  This game also has the advantage of quicker setup and quicker play over other co-op games such as LotR and Arkham Horror.

Solid cooperative game that works well with theme of the CDC basically seeking to contain epidemics and find cures as you travel the globe.  Each person has a special ability which can aid in carrying out actions of your character or another in some cases.  Its definitely difficult to contain the different diseases and easy to get distracted from what you really need to do at times.  Considering that you will often need to use 1/3 of the cards towards finding cures, that leaves you with the last 2/3 of the cards to fend off epidemics long enough to find the four cures and win.  10-2 record with 4 epidemic cards thus far and 16-5 record with 5 epidemic cards and 5-10 record with 6 epidemic cards!  I can see where you might need to start adding the 5th or 6th epidemic card after a few plays to boost the challenge level as people learn to use their roles efficiently.  You can definitely play with 5 players as well.  I must admit that I have no desire to play with only 4 epidemics any more as it is too easy (after losing my first two games with 4 epidemics, I have not been part of a losing effort since).  Even five is starting to become easy.  I do appreciate that this game plays very quickly and I usually find myself playing twice in a row (often able to get both games completed in under an hour!)

RATING: 8
I'm not sure why people are posting comments about this game being too easy... an easy way to scale it a little tougher, and one of the first rules we implemented, was that you could only discover a cure in a research center of that disease's color, rather than any research center. This requires you to build more stations than simply relying on the one in Atlanta, as well as pulls a bit more strategy into the game. 
Still trying to work out some kinks in the way that sharing knowledge works in the game... allowing players to only share the types of cards they have (ex. "I have 3 red, 1 blue, and 1 special"), and list no city names to other players seems to work fairly well, except that it makes the sharing knowledge action, which is already very difficult, even harder (unless you are the researcher).
The fact that it is a cooperative game is a nice change of pace however, and encourages you to try to play until you beat the game. Works best in groups who have self control and are able to discuss strategies as a group without trying to dictate others moves.

This game was quite fun the first few times we played it. We've played this game I believe 5 times, 4 of those times on the highest amount of epidemic cards. This game is quite challenging, which makes it very entertaining. It truly requires all players to work together and plan together to count out every steps for at least the next 2 or 3 rounds. After beating it 3 times, we stopped playing it. It's a game I myself wouldn't mind playing again, but my group is less interested in it as of right now. The replay value just doesn't seem that high, but it's a fun and challenging game nonetheless.

This game is very easy to learn and fun to play.  However it seems to be very dependent on which cards are drawn for the setup and few rounds of play.  If the locations are close together and an epidemic is pulled then you can lose the game too quickly.  

Also there doesn't seem to be any reason to not show your cards to the other players since you can still tell everyone exactly what you have.  Since this is a pure co-op it doesn't make sense to mislead the other players since it could cause you to lose too.  So really what is the point of not having an open hand at all times?

Make no mistake, this is an amazingly fun game. The intense battles we have with outbreaks and disease has intrigued me and my gaming group. Although enjoyment, as with any game I suppose, is reliant on who you play it with. Sometimes a person in my group takes the leadership role and figures out the puzzle that's presented to us and orders us around. Honestly, we don't mind because we like seeing the puzzle-solving in action, but I can definitely see how others wouldn't enjoy that so much.

This is probably my favourite game in my collection. It may not be the one I personally like best (that's Agricola currently), but it's the one that the most people enjoy that we get to play most often. It has an excellent balance of complexity, tactics, and fun that lets a new player pick up the game quickly and old players settle in and have fun each time. The expansions add a ton of depth and variation to play. And it's fun to play even with just me and my wife, which is an unusual feature in a game.

NOTE: The best rule we ever implemented was a limited amount of table-talk. This is a game where some players tend to boss around other players. When we're playing with one of those people, we use an egg-timer at the start of each turn. That timer is how long we're allowed to discuss strategy. Once the timer runs out, the person whose turn it is does whatever they want and we're not allowed to argue about it.

Fun co-op game. I love the theme and the mission of saving the world from the diseases. Sometimes the game feels a little to calculated as if you are counting the cards to see if you will be able to make a certain move or stop the disease from spreading. I am very unlucky when I play this game most of the time and I have drawn an epidemic card on my first turn the last two games I played. My brother-in-law absolutely loves this game (so I recently got him the expansion which will be exciting to try) so this is usually the game we play when I get to see him.

I enjoy Pandemic, and I love how co-operative it is. The roles are enjoyable and none are really that horrible to have. That being said one of our cards ripped our first play before we ran out and purchased protectors. Also the art is decent and everything makes sense. Players need to strategize  or else they will end up not being able to travel or build a required research station. That being said the game can be a blowout either direction far too easily, and sometimes the directions are fuzzy. (for instance how many cards one can have pre-epidemic or what to do with an outbreak that causes a second outbreak) I was super excited to play after watching TableTop. After five or six plays I really enjoy this game with the following in mind: the art is kinda boring, the pieces are just cubes, and a few scenarios or further objectives would be nice, especially with a shuffle of the player deck to continue the game. Now I know that two of those complaints were addressed in On the Brink, but this is only about the core game, not the expansion. All of that being said I enjoy co-op, especially with the girlfriend when we want a shorter, friendlier game. Solid A.

A very good co-op game that's easy to learn and teach and which can create a lot of tension. It doesn't take that much time to play and is fun for everyone, non-gamers and gamers alike. Theme-wise, the spreading of an epidemic is worked out pretty realistically and makes sense. 

Definitely a favorite game of mine.

Pandemic plays great with two, great with five. It's  especially good for people who aren't so into the idea of competitive play. I love the disease theme, and I get excited by any map boards. This is one that I teach a lot. At home, however, Steve and I have figured it to an extent that it no longer presents a challenge, so we don't play it anymore.

Fast... and not in a good way. In both times I've played it it felt like it was over before any real decisions were made, I felt like just running around a map trying to stop random events that you already knew were happening. 
"Ok I'm going to London to stop the disease from spreading", but no, France already burst into flames because you were someplace else.
A good cooperative game builds its momentum to a place where you think you can have it all and in that moment you either go down and loose horribly or win the game in a massive burst of happiness, this game lacks closure. It reaches to the point I'm barely taking things seriously (about 30 minutes into the game) and then it ends abruptely. 

Sorry Santa, this game makes me want to play Lord of the Rings...

I maaay change my rating, because maybe this is one of those games that are interesting after a series of games (like Shogun for me, I found it interesting after the second play). I'll keep playing it...

Edit: Played it two more times and it got a little better with 4 players. I'll play more to investigate.

Edit: Played more. Won once and it was OK. A 7 is fair...

Not a game for me. When I played it with the group they all loved it, but having played a solo round of it, it's basically a solvable puzzle. Once you have the "right" answer so to speak, it's boring. No replayability. Maybe expansions would've changed it but cooperative games are just not my cup of tea I've decided after playing what BGG considers the best cooperative game to date.

I enjoy many aspects and moments of this game.  How the infector phase works, debating when to use a special ability, and those turns spent trying to eradicate a diesease as the medic.

Unfortunately, the overall feel of the game doesn't click me.  I found it more enjoyable playing alone than in a group.  If I am going to be playing a game alone, it might as well be on the PC.

The whole concept of cooperative games was completely new to us, so when I first heard of [GAMEID=30549], I know I had to give it a try.  I was also motivated because in general, she beats me in most games.  This way, I wouldn't have to lose to her again.

The theme was cool (save the world instead of conquering it!), and the mechanism for the spread of the diseases is a very slick design.  Despite having only colored cubes, they took on an ominous feeling as they began to cover the world.  However, she didn't really like it.  For her, the core gameplay seemed too dry and mathematical.  Plus, she's also pretty competitive and the cooperative aspect didn't sit right with her.  On the other hand, I enjoyed it a lot.  Luckily, [GAMEID=30549] is a good solo game (probably due to being cooperative in nature).  This is one of the few games where our responses were very different.

However, when we brought this home for Christmas, we got the family playing and we all had a blast trying to save the world.  Even my girlfriend got into it---we ended up playing over and over again until we finally won.  I have to agree that cooperative games like this shine with more people---there's more discussion and more people to get involved.  It's adding a key social aspect to it that you just don't get with two players.  It's become one of my go to games for new players---I've had good luck introducing the game to new players who've liked it.  However, while it does work, I would hesitate recommending it for just two until you've tried it first.

Wonderful blend of light strategy, thematic mechanics, and a healthy dose of luck.  Perfect blend for a family game.  Very enjoyable to play; even solo is pretty fun.  So far it's been pretty hard, which I like in coops.  I feel like winning vs losing is partly due to luck but mostly due to skill.

Most of the components are great.  Theoretically you could have made them even nicer but they're good as is.  Art and styling is thematic.  Very sensible UI.

Big on extensibility.  There's really no way to complain about this game except to say that it could get samey after a while because it is a rather simple concept, even with the expansions.

Excellent ideas well executed, very challenging system, great balance between pieces, cards and individual abilities.  Strong theme, real collaboration (though there is always the risk one voice will dominate . . . this so far has not occured in our groups), tension with every turn of the card, (Mr Leacock seems to enjoy stretching players) and great replay value.  Have played enough times to  sometimes be able to take a step back and enjoy watching the group dynamics, and it is clear that the system Pandemic is a perfect platform for a wide variety of groups.  Highly recommended.

Much lighter than Red November in mechanics, makes it a much easier game to introduce to a table for the first time. Player elimination is also not a factor, unlike RN which requires you to use the "less deadly dying" rule to keep players in. The disease theme was a little off-putting at first, but the game doesn't overemphasize it. Game length is fixed in the total number of turns that can be taken by all players; while this ensures the game length is relatively regular, each player takes fewer turns as players are added which can make a 4-player game either more boring or more unsatisfying, depending on the players' pace.

Although my only play suffered from a significant rules mistake, I still got a good feel for the game, and this is the real deal. A lot of fun, reasonably tense, well-defined rules on communicating about your cards, and a quick pace. Best of all, the rules are clean and easy to learn. The arc of the story is probably even stronger once you have a couple of plays under your belt, as well.

Even though I don't rate it as an elite game yet, I definitely want to own a copy, and i think there is real potential for my rating to move up.

It's a cooperative game and takes a lot of communication.  That being said sometimes the cards fall badly and you get creamed.  This game is either quite easy or really hard.  Best case scenario for winning is to have at least four players preferably five so you can use all of the abilities.

Originally saw this game played on Wil Wheaton's webseries "Table Top" and it looked like a lot of fun --it is! Have played only 2-player and 4-player, but the more people you have the more fun it is. Game has great mechanics; unfortunately, if you don't want to lose by drawing out in a 4-player game, you need to have all 6 Epidemic cards in or you will most likely run out of cards before you can win. It's really different to play a game where everyone works together instead of against each other, and even though The Game usually beats us, we still have a lot of fun losing!!

Pandemic is one of those games where just one game is played in a sitting. More often, the first attempt fails and then multiple games are played with diffent configurations of the agents to try to "win" the game. The game is fairly simple and straightforward and is extremely fun to play.

I have not yet purchased the expansion for this game.

Truly a fun romp. I'm a fan of cooperative games.

Would be an '8' except for the mistake of using YELLOW text when YELLOW is one of the disease colors. Was anyone paying attention at all? There is no excuse for this. The game is very random as well (and I never use the word 'very').

The game is ultimately very easy and now relies on using the harder difficulty level to make it a challenge.

Extra points for being a collaborative game!

I was frustrated that my friends and I happened to win twice in our first few games, but I think that was just lucky. This also has the downside that if one player is very experienced at it, they can end up just telling everyone else what to do.

This is hands down the game that I've played the most with my sister and our favorite game to play together. We've reached the point that we work really, really well together (which was very helpful in Pandemic Legacy), and we've only lost once. It was very sad. I also just love the theme and really get into it, particularly with the extra little touches like the miniature petri dishes to hold the cubes.

I'm actually more reluctant to play with other people, but I'll always be really excited to get in a good game with Maxie, particularly when we use some of the expansions.

Brutally hard to a fault. The huge randomness makes it a bit disheartening sometimes, but I guess it keeps me coming back.

Update: The randomness is less random that I thought at first. The fact that the cards get recycled is the key part of the strategy. The expansions take it from a simple game to something more complex and deeper and add lots of replayability. My favorite coop.

A very clever game that plays quickly, yet offers relatively deep gameplay.  The tension in this game consistently ratchets up in a manner that provides a great narrative and story arc to the game.  The rules are easy to grasp and the theme is compelling, which makes Pandemic accessible to a wide audience.  There are very few downsides to this game that I can see at the moment; perhaps with repeated play this will become somewhat tired, but there are many combinations of roles to play, each combination providing a different experience requiring changes in approach, tactics and strategy.  I have felt that as I play more I have gotten better at the game, which suggests that this is a game of some skill that can be developed as one discovers how the game reacts and the uses of the various roles.  Highly recommended.  Review based on approximately 15 plays.  Note:  finally beat Heroic level in 2-player with Medic and Researcher - a very powerful combination.  With a different combination (especially excluding the Medic in 2-player), Heroic level will chew you up and spit you out.  Good fun.

This is one of the games I like to lose from. There is a high level of intensity in this game. When you are working together to beat the epidemic threatening to kill the world, you need to keep a close eye to everything that's happening. Within one round it is possible to lose the game.
This game is very good for family gaming. There's so much interaction with each other that you will come together as a team.

Quick game (almost a filler!) that can easily be explained to newbie. Even at normal level (5 epidemic) the game can be challenging (especially if the roles don't mech together). 

For a game that quick and easy to learn 3 things impresse me much:
1- it is incredibly easy to have rules wrong. Even after 4 games... See Ekted FAQ post to clear things out.
2- The theme is so well integrated with the mechanics (especially the epidemic way to put the discard ON TOP of the draw deck).
3- It is impossible to refuse to play anither gfame if you just lose. IMPOSSIBLE!

A fairly slick and concise coöp, probably the most concise since Scotland Yard; not messy or complicated at all.  The game has a wonderful sense of panic when outbreaks and epidemics occur, and I have to say that this particular "progression of evil" is one of my favorites; I get a particular delight infecting cities with disease.  The only glaring flaw of the game is the lack of distinctive players; for all intents and purposes, a single player could run four hands or four players could run four hands, without any significant difference of strategy being made.  This aside, a good game which should only be played on Heroic.

Excellent co-op without fostering the mistrust common to Shadows.  Holding it back is the tendency for one player (usually me) to drive the others.

(Updated 5 years later: as other co-op games have addressed the alpha-player problem in various ways, that particular issue feels magnified in this game.)

This game is great if you have a group of people that express their opinion and also don't boss around.  Definitely have to work and plan together.  Plays quickly, probably 35 minutes.  Also works well with 2 players.  We usually play 2 characters each so it is like a 4 player game.  Everyone is cooperating anyway so it doesn't change things much except you actually see both character's hands that you are playing.

Played once, a 3 player game on 'easy'.  While there are clever mechanics here that quite nicely simulate the spread of a disease and the game design can be quite challenging, it does not feel like playing a game, nor quite like a puzzle.  You are not pitting your wits against a sentient thing, as in an opponent in a regular board game or against an AI in a computer game, both of which are much more satisfying.  No, here you are playing against Fate, who delivers its moves through a semi-random card draw (I say semi-random, as there are mechanics in the game to make the same cities come up again).  All you can do is play your hand as dealt the best you can and it is not superior play in overcoming an opponent that allows you to win but random fortune.  And although there is a nice simulation here, I did not feel that I was getting a narrative flow of a story unfolding here but more of a desperate 'do what we can' each turn and hope for the best.  I would not refuse to play it again, nor any other coop game, but it would not be my suggestion.

The game that hooked me.  My feelings about it are so strong that I don't know how objective I can be.  But this seems to me to be a beautiful interweaving of elegance and drama.  I love that I can play it solo.  The theme is strong and the production appropriately spare.  The collective panic when a game starts slipping away is something to experience, as is the collective exuberance when you pull a game back from the brink.  Win or lose, the game really does make a team out of the players.  Splendid.

Bad game. Sorry but it's almost useless to play with other players. All the players have to pursue the same goal, AND have no personal agendas that could create interesting conflicts (like "I do the good thing for the main game or I do the good thing for my character"). In short, you simply can play this one alone, using all the "roles" and keeping all the cards on the table.
Finally, what a stupid rule is "You have to take the cards hidden in your hand during play BUT you can tell the other players what you have in your hand... It's terribly dumb!  < I translated from my italian rulebook, so please don't take this one as a quoting of the original rulebook.

Lots of fun, and a hard game to beat. Much fewer arguements over who should be doing what than in Shadows Over Camelot, and it really does play in around 45 minutes, so it takes 1/2 the time.  Okay, played this 7 times in 24 hours, it's infecting (all puns intended, stolen from a review by Michael Barnes). Seriously, we all just keep going back for more. On the 7th try (with Gaming Group A, solo game, then Gaming Group B) finally beat the game on total-wussy mode (Introductory).  Jeeesh, this game is tough.  Love it.

UPDATE: Played this more than 20 times with a variety of people.  Great game, just BEGGING for an expansion that adds variety without increasing the time it takes to play the game.

One of the best cooperative games out there.  Collect color sets of 5 to find a cure for a disease.  You must keep diseases from spreading on the board and you cannot allow too many outbreaks.  However, you have to work together to find cures which means you must be closely co-located.  The game is very well done and very family friendly.  It is a little harder to learn than a typical family game, but with some effort in learning the rules, anyone can learn to play this game.  It is a must own game for any collection.

For once the label "multi-player solitaire" can be applied in a non-derogatory manner.  The mechanics match the theme perfectly.  Tension is present throughout the game as players try and prevent the outbreaks until the cures can be found.  This is cooperative gaming at its best.  Previous attempts at coop games have fallen flat for me.

Here is another game that I can't understand the appeal.  Every game I have seen had one or two people telling everyone else exactly what to do.  How is this fun?  I mean besides for the bossy ones?

I listen closely to my boss at work and follow his orders.  But that is WORK not gaming.  If a game is reliant on blindly following one person than it should be called Solitaire and not include me.

I absolutely love this game. And everyone I have played it with or introduced it to has loved this game. This was my first 'step-up' game after playing Catan and Ticket to Ride and I'm so happy it was. It really cemented my enjoyment in this hobby and I knew I wanted to play more games and get more involved. I was coming into board games like most people I think, with preconceptions about what boardgames were and who they were for based on the games from my childhood. This game shattered that, and really peaked my interest in the hobby.

It has also helped me introduce boardgames to my wife and friends that are not gamers. This was the first co-op game I ever played, and I think that helps so much with non-gamers. We're all in this together. That is such an inviting concept compared to memories of Monopoly that led to sibling fights. 

This might be my favorite game.

Not bad. The cooperative elements seem to be straightforward, optimizing the best moves available then hoping you can execute in time. Like most co-ops, it can have problems with overly dominant players. I like it and I think it will be nice for solo play. Looking forward to getting the expansion.

Update July 2017
Haven't played this in over 15 years, but revisited it and some modern variants in the past year or so, including Cthulhu and Iberia. I really liked it way back when it was one of the first co-ops to appear on the scene. Nowadays I feel like the mechanisms are too artificial...or perhaps the nature of the mechanisms feel obtrusive, less integrated into the theme than could be. I may have been spoiled by Burgle Bros. In any case, I feel like my tastes have changed and the Pandemic mechanisms don't hold up well for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very cool co-op game with interesting mechanics.  Everyone is trying to beat the virus, which is a paper machine.  The intensifying action when epidemic cards are drawn is clever.

Re-playability comes from initial set up (which cities and how infected by random draw), roles, and different people you play with.  Otherwise it would feel samey after many plays.  Difficulty is adjusted by the number of epidemic cards you seed.

Very tight game.  Especially at "normal" difficulty level and above, the game is often won or lost on the last turn before a losing condition occurs.

Have not yet played with the expansion, which looks promising.

Would be a great party game.

7/2008 Played one 4 player open-hand introductory game.  There's really not much going on in the game, still it's interesting and intense.  Its very well balanced; you need to make some good decitions and have a little luck when drawing cards in order to beat the game.  I'm getting a feeling this is a kind of solitare puzzle game that's been tweaked to allow for multiple players cooperating on solving the puzzle.  Definitely needs some more play.

I can't seem to win at this, even on the easiest difficulty. I'm not sure whether to give up on this game, or keep trying. The problem with losing is that I'm losing against a deck of cards, so it never feels like I've been outsmarted or outplayed in any way. 

I probably wouldn't play this with a group, since co-op games can get a bit dictatorial. The fact that this game is so hard makes me less inclined to share the experience. I think the only reason I'm keeping this is because it can be played solo on the rare occasion when there's no one around to game with, and given all the hype over this, I feel like maybe one day everything will just "click" and I'll start winning.

Quick, simple, with about the right mixture of tactic and luck.

Minor complaints: laborious setup, unbalanced roles and slightly unpractical board (small, crowded).

I've never had so much fun losing all the time! Seriously, I'm super competitive, and this is kind of like a game of blackjack where the house always gets 20 and wins ties. You need skill and a decent amount of luck to win on the hardest difficulty. But that makes it all the more awesome when you do win. Honestly, I win about 30 percent of the time on the hardest difficulty, and 70 percent of the time on the easiest one

Regarding complaints of domineering "alpha" players in co-ops: It's the group's job to discourage/resist/avoid this behavior, much like how you would deal with a "ball hog" on a basketball court, a "[url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_%28role-playing_games%29]munchkin[/url]" in a storytelling game, or a grudge-holder in a negotiation game.

RATING: 8
This is a great Co-op game. Everyone I have played with has enjoyed it. If playing with new players it is extremely important not to be the alpha - let them make their own decisions and don't let them ask "what should I do?" every turn. 

The mechanics for epidemic cards make the game challenging at all levels, and the ability to adjust the difficulty keeps replayability high. We are teaching many groups with 4 epidemic cards, and that seems fair. New groups almost always lose, but it's a great way to get another game started right away. 

Thinking about picking up expansions, but this game doesn't really need any yet.

I actually have the urge to do something I've never done before on BGG - rate a game before I've played it.  That's how pumped up I am for this one!

Got it today (2/20/08).  I opened it up and the components look fantastic.  I'm going to count the cards as suggested by another BGG user.  Then... time to save the world!

UPDATE:  I had a similar problem with the cards - 2 player cards for St. Petersburg, none for San Franscisco.  I will email Zev to rectify.

I played my first game, and it was amazing!  Tense, fun - I won on my last turn.  I played solo with the Ops Expert and Scientist, at the Intro level.  Very fun!  I'd say it was as tense as LotR, with a more satisfying theme (but then again I am a physician).  I will introduce my wife to it tomorrow - she saw it laid out an was interested, which is a rarity.  I will update how the couples play goes.

I love this game. The cooperative aspect is a lot of fun, but the odds are against the players and a win is difficult for more than 3P. It's easier to win with two players. It's a pretty quick game, and can be easily lost in minutes. This game sees the table regularly. The On the Brink expansion is a definite must for anyone who likes the base game. We're still uncertain about In the Lab, but it is definitely interesting.

RATING: 8
Fun game, you need to be in a group that is happy to discuss but also without a person that will take over the conversation too much. It can be easy for players to get lost in this game if they aren't completely involved and in the conversation, at which point the rest of the players will just take up that players token.

One of the games I aesthetically admire. The mechanics are good, the process of travelling around the world trying to manage the crysis is tense, but the most important part is that spreading the disease feels wonderful: pretty cubes laying around the points on the map make it look like a monitor in different sci-fi or disaster films, you watch them spread, cross each other, watch them being purified and watch them explode, covering half of the map in a blink like a wildfire...

Pandemic was another birthday gift - this time from my parents who heard that this game got great reviews.  It was also my first co-operative game.

The theme is wonderfully implemented, the game is easy to teach and fast paced, and tension keeps building for players to the end.  The only problem is that due to all that well-executed tension Pandemic is really vulnerable the Dictator Effect, with one player taking over and telling the other players what to do on their turns - not that this is unique problem to Pandemic, it's just that for some reason Pandemic seems to have it happen more frequently, and I suspect that thematic tension is the culprit.  No one wants to have the world succumb to killer diseases on their watch!

RATING: 8
Fun co-op game.  Not unlike Shadows over Camelot.  A bit simpler to jump in and get going however.  I think I actually prefer Pandemic in many ways.  None of this "stay in character and not reveal your cards" crap.  If you want to tell a teammate you have card X, you tell them you have card X.

A great cooperative experience. It is essential to avoid that one player dominates and decides what everybody should do. The experience is ruined if not.
Play with hidden hands, allow for suggestions of other players but leave the final decision of action to the active player.

The game is quite unforgiving and really hard. It mostly comes down to how the two decks are stacked, but who cares as long as the game is such fun?

RATING: 6
I am not exactly sure what all the hype is about. I mean, this game is ok, but it nothing special. I think that the cooperative games genre is a little waek and so this stands out as a light coop game, but it really is just an average game. It feels very generic, the production quality (other than the texture of the board) is a little weak. The art is basically a photoshopped Google Earth image with that horrible pandemic logo slapped on there. The bits do not really fit on the map and the map design wastes a fair amount of space. All in all its just a very  average game. Maybe a few more plays will charm me, but I doubt it.

This game fills a lot of great niches.  It is a fun quick filler, fun solitaire, and a great gateway game.  I've played this a few times with my serious gaming group, which I enjoyed.  But the most enjoyable part was I got my parents (who's board game experience is once-a-year Scrabble) addicted.  And any game I can play with my family on visits or holidays is well-worth the investment.  If you're looking for a serious co-op game to occupy a bunch of experiences gamers, I'd go with Shadows Over Camelot.  But if you need a quick game, or something to play with new people, then look no further: this is the perfect game for you.

Although the theme, for me, is to die for, I find this game lacking in several ways. The cooperative factor, along with the idea of fighting a pandemic, drove me to this game. But its susceptibility to follow the leader, and its ensuing unfriendliness to new players really turns it off as a family game. And as a pure strategy game, it lacks the variety, with randomness and luck mainly deciding the variety. The expansion improves greatly on that aspect though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Overall good game. It can be easy if four players get the scientist, researcher, dispatcher, and Organizer. However, you can get wrecked pretty quick if there's back to back pandemic cards drawn, which causes outbreaks on cities you just hit and then a whole chain happens (to which, little you can do) and then the cubes run out. Bam done. Happened two games in a row. Yes we shuffled the deck but I guess there's that odd chance that the last card in one deck and the first in the next can be pandemic cards, and those cities could have 5 others connected (using up more cubes). Apart from helpless frustration at times, it is a fun game. It's cool to work together to beat the game. You feel accomplished when you beat it. But this game doesn't seem super special to me, I couldn't see giving it more than an 8.5 but I will change score after more plays. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played 8 times solo (with only 1 win!) Enjoy the game very much, but I think the mechanic definitely gets a bit old after multiple plays. Had one 4 player game where we lost as well, and felt that there just wasn't enough player cards to effectively do anything. It seemed like if you made a mistake early in the game then you might as well stop because you'll never be able to keep up with the unrelenting tide of cubes.

Originally a 9, downgraded to an 8, though I do very much enjoy this game.

Feb 14: Still play with my wife on occasion. Still very much enjoy it, though we are definitely much better at it. Using 6 epidemic cards made it more fun

Pandemic was the first co-operative game I ever played and I loved it right away. The whole concept is great and its implementation was even greater - the outbreak mechanic is absolutely magnificent. Someone might argue that some of the other mechanics are a little odd (notably the movement of players), but I have to remind you that this is a game and not a documentary about pandemics.  

The best description I can give is "a simple, but not easy, family thematic game". Unfortunately, not all my friends from my gaming group share my feelings, so we don't get to play Pandemic as often as I would like.

7.5 - Nov 2015 - 14 Plays:  My tastes seem to be shifting away from co-operative games at this time for multiplayer gaming.  I struggle with this game to not be the quarterback, so I don't often suggest pulling it out.

Nice Coop/Solitare game.  I always feel the pressure to 'save humanity'.  This one never gets old for me.

RATING: 7
Co-operative game of trying to save the world from a global Pandemic. There are other co-op games that I have enjoyed more than this one. My big issue is when one person is making all the decisions and the rest of us are sitting around doing what we are told. Much more fun if you each are pursuing individual goals for the good of the entire group. (See Shadows over Camelot)

Initial rating 7.5, after 8 games 7.5

I like the game, here are some thoughts about it:
+ A group with a unbalanced experience with the game can result in an unsatisfactory gaming experience
+ For my an my spouce the game works perfect while playing the two of us (she loves it!)
+ I like the quality of the cards, but the rest of the components could have been better. The box insert is the worst I've seen so far (Z-man english second edition).
+ I think that the risk of a leader problem is high, that's why I think that it works better as a two player game
+ The game seems to be hard, maybe unfair... but in a fun way!
+ The game is short, and I think that is a great plus
+ I wouln't recommend it as a gateway game, because I think that is not a game for everyone and that in a four player game of non-gamers someone will get bored (at least that's my experience)
+ If the game worked better with four players I'm sure it will be an 8 for me

Excellent co-op game. Scales well to different numbers of players. I enjoy being able to change the difficulty level simply by the changing the number of Epidemic cards in play.

The expansion On The Brink adds a lot to the game, with the extra roles and three new 'versions' (virulent strain, mutation, and bio-terrorist).  Plus, the petri dishes are sweet!

For me its the best cooperative board game of all time. I cant count the times I played this game and every single game was outstanding and fun.
With all the expansions available you can set the difficulty individual so that it will never get too easy for you. The hardest difficulty isnt possible to handle without all the luck from the irish ;)

This was our first game that we found from BGG, and we still enjoy it.  We don't play it as often as the games above because with just the two of us the game feels a little repetitive after we've played it a few time.  We are definitely considering introducing friends into the game though - it's complicated enough to have some depth but simple enough to pick up quickly.  The cooperative aspect is also very good for encouraging players to work together to find a workable strategy.

Initially played solo as others were not too keen on the idea of co-operative games - 'what's the point?' Took a couple of games to ensure that I was following all of the rules correctly but now seems too easy. I'm winning two out of every three games using two characters. 
Update: played a proper two-player and beat the system with the last possible action. Good fun.

The game shines at four players - why? The simple reason is that then the interaction between players is the most intense - one has an idea, other tries to help with it, while the third comes with another idea and tries to force the others to follow. This is the "conseil" concept of the game - we try to work out what would be the best moves of the team. Interesting and quite uncommon regarding the most board games.

Revised rating after recent series of plays. four or five solo games leading up to a game with a group of new and more experienced gamers.  It was much better than I remembered it being.

Good co-operative fun. My group of regular board game players are always willing to play the game. A real focus on player interaction, with each player making suggestions and contributing to the common goal. Can be quite challenging, with the odd disappointing loss, but people do come back for more. Like with most games of this genre, it's better when the players expand their own narrative about events during the game. Something that makes them want to talk about the good and the bad and what will draw them back to the table the next time.

One of the better co-op games I've played.  The games have always been tense, and the game has plenty of meat for the relatively short time it takes to play.  Either a really meaty filler or a serious short game, depending on your group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Thematically cool and a fun simple concept but for me a if i want to like a coop it needs to do something about the dominant player aspect. There needs to be information open to only some players or a traitor etc. that prevents everyone just openly discussing the best play and some players not actively doing much. Pandemic has no such thing which leaves this as only a 1 or 2 player exercise for me and too simple at that. It's just a simple risk calculation which cities to clean up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun cooperative game with very interesting infection dynamics.  Amazing how many times you think you have things under control and suddenly a pandemic explodes and you lose the game.  The strategies are pretty straight forward and it then comes down to the luck of the draw in terms of initial infections and how soon the epidemic cards arrive.  So it's a fun game but wins are never guaranteed, and sometimes (it seems) impossible, so not a game to take seriously.  I also feel that once the players have found a successful strategy then there's little point left in playing the game any more so I do wonder about it's long term playability.

RATING: 6.5
I'm not as in love with Pandemic as a lot of other people, and that's because there seems to be precious few ways to influence events one way or the other.  For instance, during one game, I had the benefit of being able to look at the top few cards of the infection deck and rearrange them.  Even with this advantage, we still wound up with an unstoppable outbreak cascade, due to the way the game stacks the same cards repeatedly.  I'm not convinced that better strategy could have salvaged that game, and that's a bit worrisome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid game; I quite like the theme and the sense of looming disaster when there are 2 or 3 cities about to outbreak in a cluster. But it leaves me a little cold: there are optimal moves and I'm the jerk who will tell you what you HAVE to do. For me, the game is more about parking that urge than saving the world. Probably a good lesson and perhaps I should play more often. 

At least the games are quick - we had one blow up on turn 1 (right after player 2): all the black blocks were gone; what a nice introduction to Pandemic for my Significant Other.

Coop games have a big pitfall: one player will tell everybody what to do. It often ends up in 'You do this, then you do that, then I can do this'. Pandemic did not offer mechanisms to avoid that trap. It may be better as a solo game.

Nice and well thought out mechanics. But the game play just did not capture me. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that while you do have a character, that character isn't really yours, but rather the teams. Everything is decided co-op, and I guess it kind of distances me from the game. So, I understand why others may appretiate it, but to me it feels a bit too sterile (pardon the pun). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great co-op. Unfortunately the "quarterbacking" issue can take hold, particularly if new players are in the game.

--EDIT-- Having played Pandemic Legacy now, if anything the comparison sheds a somewhat poor light on the original Pandemic, oddly lowering my opinion of the original. Of course it was the blueprint for the polished mechanics under-pinning Pandemic Legacy, but at the same time original Pandemic's biggest flaw; a serious lack of replay-ability due to its formulaic nature, casts an even longer shadow. It deserves credit for the concept, but at this point I very much doubt if an offer to play the original Pandemic would be very appealing.

Pandemic is the game my group played most in 2008, and we loved every single minute of it whether we won or lost -- which is part of the beauty of Pandemic. It's like crack.

Pandemic is easy to teach in an absolute blast to play. Every time we play, we immediately want to play again so we can try a new strategy. Our win:loss ratio is creeping up to even, and it's fun to watch our progress over time.

The components are great, as is the theme -- I just wish there were slightly more to the theme. Not giving the diseases actual names feels very PC, but it robs Pandemic of some easy flavor. We usually go with Black Plague, Pox, Yellow Fever, and forget to call blue anything but Blue.

3 plays - 2 losses, 1 win.  Tense.  More plays.  Also added the On the Brink expansion.  At this point I prefer Defenders of the Realm - unlikely to play pandemic again.  I can't deny the place it has in the development of co-op games, but it has been replaced.

Comes across like a bland puzzle more than a game. This will be leaving my collection when I get around to the big pruning that needs to happen.

+ On the Brink expansion
+ In the Lab expansion

Rating based on SOLO play only.

It's like solving a big puzzle whose parameters keep changing and evolving. Great sense of rising tension and good frustration (there's always a feeling of "if I only had ONE more action..."). I find the game design very elegant in how the virus spreads and how quickly the game can change, yet it does so in a very organic way.

Expansion comments: 
-On the Brink: I tend to not use the Mutation and Virulent Strain modes very often because I think the base game is hard enough for me, but the extra role/event cards and the petri dishes (a nice thematic touch) make this a good expansion to have 
-In the Lab: really changes things up and after just a couple of plays I don't think I'd play without this now

This is the game got me into this hobby.  I never knew board games could be cooperative.  I fell in love with the theme and it hurts when you are unable to save the world.  The epidemic cards, though horrifying, are what make the game exciting.

It's great because you get sucked into the theme and we always name the diseases.  Be careful of quarterbacking/alpha gamers.  It happens often.

RATING: 7
Nice coop, but for my taste a bit too simplistic in its playstyle. In general: It is more difficult with more players (2 players is nearly too easy, while 4 players is much more challenging).
Update: The expansion on the brink makes it far more interesting, as it adds more variety (which is great especially for a puzzle game). With the expansion I would give 9 points!

Not much of a "game". Felt like there were very few compelling decisions and the co-op aspect was really just everyone playing their role and not much else.

Yes, the way the deck is shuffled (location of epidemic cards) can very likely affect the outcome of the game. Yes, it suffers from alpha-gamer syndrome in some groups. Does this make me like the game a little less? No doubt. BUT, it's just a fantastic game! You can play this game with just about anyone, and they can all get behind the theme. It's fun, reasonably fast, has solid components and an elegant design. I might like it best as a 2 player with my wife.

A great co-op that has a really unique and interesting theme, which is pretty immersive and makes you think you are saving the world. This game also has my favorite mechanic, the Intensify mechanic of reshuffling diseased cities back onto the top of the deck to be drawn again. Pandemic can have a pretty big alpha player problem though.

RATING: 4
Let me start by saying that Pandemic might be best quality of manufacturing I have seen in a game.  The boards and cards are nice heavy stock, and the print job was nicely done.  I am not one to usually ooze about board quality, but I genuinely appreciate this one.

That being said, Pandemic is not a game that is intended to be played every week.  It's a nice quick game to play when you're feeling really cooperative and have an hour between other games; it does this very well.  I am very happy to have it in my collection, even if it took me quite a while to get to the table.

RATING: 6
3 / 5 - Good.

This is one of the better co-op games I've come across - it offers a decent amount of chaos, usually results in a tense end-game and the random role each player gets increases not only re-playability but the sense of individual action. However the theme is silly (cash in five airline tickets for a global cure!) and it's not totally immune from loudest-player syndrome.

RATING: 7.5
Super intense and unforgiving.  Lots of fun.  If you play though you need to play with other people on a similar level of expertise at games otherwise one player takes over and goes all alpha-gamer on everyone.  The role cards seem a bit unbalanced as well.  Some, like the scientists, which allows you to cure a disease with only 4 cards rather than five makes the game significantly easier while a couple other roles seem useless in comparison.  Really like it and will play often with my wife.  great with 2 players.

RATING: 8.05
Pro: Played friend's copy. Took some time to get the mechanics down, but it feels like it will play rather fast once everybody gets things down and thus can get repeat plays in a single setting. It's a very well done co-op.

Con: Winning can be dependent on what roles players are given. I'll play it if that's what's being played, but not really asking to play it.

Rating Potential: 8. I'm OK with my rating.

Update: Last two games really fell flat although that was partly due to an error in the initial shuffling of the cards. This is no longer worthy of an 8. I just need to figure out where as a 7 it lays.

Amazing game that not only scales well but also provides the levels of play with only a simple change in setup.  Great theme (grounding in reality) for non-gamers to feel comfortable with (no orcs, beasts, medieval knights, etc.) and the coop nature of the game lets the entire family feel good about working together against the game. This may be THE game for the family. 

We were really hot on the game for awhile but then all of a sudden...it hasn't been to the table in awhile. Hmmmm....lowered my rating by a full notch since I don't really have a strong desire to play it either.  Good game initially though.  Still would pull it out for new gamers.

As this is somewhat my line of work (HIV/AIDS in Africa) I was pretty excited to get this.  After two very close games (won on the very last turn both times) and one where we clobbered the game (lucky shuffle) I felt, more than I'd ever felt with a game before, that we'd "finished" with this one.  The game just felt very similar each time we played.  Even the close games were not very tense.  OK game, but just didn't quite do it for me.

RATING: 10
When I think of Pandemic, I think that it's the perfect game.  It's a co-op, and it brings people together to complete the noblest of tasks: save the world population from extinction by disease.  It does it in such a great way, where mechanics and theme come together seamlessly to immerse players in the narrative.

In Pandemic players take on various roles, each with its own unique powers.  Using these powers wisely in conjunction with other players' roles is the the best chance you have to win the game.  On a player's turn they will move around the board, which is a global map.  They will try to treat diseased populations, build research facilities where cures can be found, gather cards to be used for curing disease, and then actually cure those diseases.  Watch out though, every turn more cities become infected with one of four deadly viruses, which are colour coded. 

To win, players must cure all four diseases.  However, there are many ways to lose.  If any one disease has gotten so out of control that there are no more cubes left in its colour, players lose.  Players will also lose if there are too many outbreaks triggered.  Finally, if the draw deck runs out before all four diseases are cured, that also counts as a loss for the players.

Pandemic is tense right from the beginning, and it only gets worse as the game progresses.  You're immediately thinking, "How can we possibly put out all these 'fires' all over the globe?".  It will take teamwork, skill, and luck to save the world from the Pandemic!


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's not bad. But it's basically a puzzly, cube pushing, solitary Euro - nothing special. 

Take this with a grain of salt - I'm not a fan of most co-ops, as I think they're either an argument in a box, or a solitaire cube pusher, depending on how they are structured.

3rd best game of 2008. 
The grandfather of co-ops.. But expansions have kept Pandemic fresh and relevant too.. Especially On the Brink is a must-have. But I really like In the Lab too, it makes the game pretty complex, but it's all the more rewarding to beat it. State of Emergency has nice balance between the two, it has some essential additions and some that are fun to play every now and then. For lightest gameplay Forbidden Island is better anyway. New edition greatly improved the artwork and components of the game. Highest difficulty setting is very hard and there are tons of role combinations to try. People who think it's too easy: make it hard, if you want it hard! It's a co-op classic that belongs to every shelf. 

2-Player Comment:
* Pandemic is co-op game and works well with two. Some role combos are harder than others though. You can also play with 2 pawns each, but it's not required (and personally I don't like that). Pandemic is very good 2p game.

Expansions:
+Pandemic: On the Brink
+Pandemic: In the Lab
+Pandemic: State of Emergency

This was, essentially, the game that kicked off my love affair with tabletop gaming. It was one of the first co-op board games I'd ever played, and I really liked the mechanics behind it. With all the different ways you can lose this game, it really feels like the game is playing AGAINST you. This game is EASY to learn, but impossible to master. You could get right down to the wire and BARELY make it through, or you could last a half a round before you get screwed by some bad chain reactions. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who's thinking of "testing the waters" so to speak. Barring a few clarifications between different classes and their subsequent abilities, I feel like this game really transcends various age groups, and personal interests (ie. non-gamers).

This is the game (other than Arkham Horror) that really got me into co-op games. Sure there's the risk of Alpha player syndrome (and my eldest son is so good at the game that his advice is usually worth listening to and hard to argue against), but it's still great. It's one of the few co-ops of this ilk that we have actually played at a number of difficulty levels - to the point where we felt that we'd, not exactly "solved" it, but were winning too reliably for it to be fun.

RATING: 3.5
[04/08/2008] 1 4-player game. A trifle slow, and mostly the game is playing you, rather than the other way around. Essentially the end game came down to a decision on whether to go here or there - if here, and this card came out, or there, and that card came out, then we're good. However, if here, and that card comes out, or there, and this card comes out, then we're screwed. Could we have played better - sure. Do I care enough to go play again, not really. I'd probably play it again, at some point, but I wouldn't buy it.

Awesome game and the expansion keeps it fresh.  I rate it a "10" because it was the perfect game to get my wife interested in the new generation of board games.

I like it best with two players, as introducing new players to play a co-op alongside very experienced players is a bit tedious for everyone, plus the game is harder with more players to boot.

Great cooperative.  The one thing I find wrong with the game is that after I play it, if we lose, I generally feel bummed, but if I win, I'm only marginally enthused.

I'm not sure why.  Usually, in a competitive game, victory or defeat seems almost like an afterthought.  I usually don't care one way or another.  For some reason, this one's different.  I think it's because defeat can pop up so suddenly from an unexpected quarter.

This is an amazing co-op game.  I play mostly with my wife and this is a game that I can't really imagine getting tired of.  Win or lose, I usually want to play again immediately.

A great jump off point for players looking for a more advanced cooperative game. The theme is easy to get behind and the mechanics can be picked up quickly and easily... just be prepared to lose a few times. Also be warned that an alpha gamer can quickly spoil this one so make sure you play with the right people.

Very good cooperative game based around getting rid of different outbreaks occurring around the world. Wasn't aware that I would be getting the first edition, which requires an updated set of cards from the publisher ($10) to be able to add expansions. I will instead be trading this away to a collector (hopefully) and repurchase the second edition.

THIS IS A FIRST EDITION COPY!!

RATING: 9.1
The best part of this game is that it's co-operative.  The theme is wonderful, the gameplay is challenging, but it's the interaction and working with the other players that really makes this game fun to play.  

This game could be played Solo, however this makes it too easy.  It's more interesting with more people, as it gets harder to communicate, and explain the best possible route of action, much like the real world, where there are many truths and solutions that are independent of what people know, but it's much more beneficial for everyone to understand than for just one person to understand.  

If you understand exactly what to do in this game all the time, or are more experienced than those you play with, it's better to hang back a little, and learn to communicate without manipulating others turns.  Allowing others to discover the right action without explicitly telling them will actually help them have a better experience.  

I find it interesting because self absorbed people who may be impatient and really smart will feel like they are playing a solo game, and don't need anyone else around, which is true, but that's part of the challenge and appeal... to have to work with others..  and if they play with others who are self absorbed/controlling but smarter, they will feel like they aren't making decisions.. or being pushed around... This game has led me to a lot of personality analysis, and led me to understanding co-operative leadership a little more.

A very interesting cooperative game. It plays very well solitaire as well. The game provides a special sense of tension as you anxiously wait to see what card will come up next. I really dislike the semi-glossy board (NOT a linen finish) and the semi-glossy cheap cards of my first edition copy.

The ultimate co-op. Save the world from plaque! Plays very similar to Forbidden Island. I love the theme and the rules are intuitive.

Take Arkham Horror.  Make these changes: The goal remains the same, the theme is much less compelling (but still pretty good), the playtime is slashed to something reasonable, and the game is several orders of magnitude better.  That's Pandemic.

Like most co-ops, it does suffer a bit from the tendency for one player to take control of the game.

I gave this one away.  I always have a good time playing it, and the game never drags, but it's a co-op so I'm never the one to suggest it.  I like playing other people's copies every now and then, but have no need to own it myself.

fun game either solo, with 2, or with 4 (havent played with 3 but see no reason for it to be otherwise).

I finally got around to playing this after owning it for close to a year. We played two games back to back with four players each time.

The game is thematic and plays at a relatively brisk pace.

When I tried to learn the rules I just couldn't get them straight in my mind. This put me off. I usually don't have problems figuring a game out, but for some reason I remained perplexed.

When we played it seemed that some rules were a bit confusing and unclear. So based on this first experience I am underwhelmed. I was expecting a solid co-operative game. So far I still prefer Minion Hunter, Lord of the Rings and Shadows to this.

So I haven't been set alight like most of the community here on the geek but perhaps this will change after a few more plays.

Great cooperative game.  After a couple of games, it's really fast to play and can almost be played as a filler while waiting for the rest of the gang to arrive.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
As a dissenting voice, let me say that I guess I just don't get this one. I was looking forward to it but, having played it a few times, it just doesn't excite. Leaves me very cold. Girlfriend finds the theme depressing. I read session reports and reviews, each raving about the innovation and tension, but it doesn't work for me, nor for anyone I've so far played with. It's really frustrating to play a game with varied groups in the hope that one of them will say: "Yeah, man. It really works for us." 

Basically, it's a co-operative game with a "ticking-bomb" type of mechanism determined by the turn of a card. Its innovation is that when the "bomb" goes off, infections escalate and the cards that have caused the epidemic are placed back on top of the stack to increase the threat. Wooo. Somebody wake me up.

To explain my problem with the game, here it is: you are reliant on all the other idiots around the table to succeed, and even then it's likely the system will screw you. I think it's because I'm excited by competing against the other players. I've never liked solo games - they're too dry. This is essentially a solo game where you don't get to make all the decisions that lose you the game. Lots of people like this kind of guff. I'm not one of them.

Not my worst game ever, but my biggest disappointment.

I think the game feels odd with a larger group, but more often than not this sees its play with my spouse and longest standing gaming partner.

I really do enjoy it, but I do hope the player opponent in the expansion brings the fun to the larger group

Juegazo! He estado mucho tiempo leyendo sobre este juego y, la verdad, me parece uno de los mejores colaborativos. Temática, mecánica y roles atractivos. No es complicado de aprender pero a veces, cuando te crees que va todo sobre ruedas, se te desmonta la partida y pierdes en 2 turnos. Es de mis colaborativos favoritos, junto a Noviembre Rojo (Brutal) y La sombra de Cthulhu (muy chulo por su temática). 

ME PARECE INFINITAMENTE MEJOR que "la isla prohibida", del mismo autor, nombrado juego del año en españa 2011 y que a mi me parece mucho menos atractivo y más flojo.

Given that the game is actually a solitaire game against the system, what really makes it then is to set the difficulty level up high & let the tension build as you play against the system. In that event, it's fun.

Best played "in character" letting people make the decisions they think best (although discussion is always good in co-op games) but if someone just dominates & commandeers the game and all actions etc, they're really just playing solitaire themselves against the system & everyone else is just making up the numbers

I really like the way this game looks and works.  The idea of it did not interest me until I had seen so many good comments about it so I wanted to try.  At first I thought I liked it not because it's a great game but because it's addictive in the "just one more time" kind of way.  Now I think it's just a very tight design that works wonderfully.  It's short enough and frustrating enough when you barely lose that I wonder if it's pandering to that instinct to make me play more until I beat it.  Bumped the rating up after several plays.

For me this is a "family style" game: easy rules, short gameplay and "nice" (cooperative), so I hesitated quite a while before I bought it. But it's better than I thought it would be.

I had been looking for a small-group cooperative game, and Pandemic fits the bill perfectly.  I've heard complaints that the theme is not very engrossing and that the game feels scripted, but I experienced neither of those with my gaming group.  We have a blast racing around the world trying to keep the diseases at bay while frantically searching for the cures.  The tension is great, and we really feel like we're accomplishing something, which is a feature that Shadows over Camelot always seemed to lack (despite the fact that we love that game too).  I absolutely love this game, and it's probably one of my best game purchases.

Excellent co-op!  One of my most-played games and always well received with any group we play with.  As with any co-op, there can be a tendency for 1 or 2 individuals to dominate the group and try to make all the decisions, but if you can avoid that it's a great experience and very interactive.  Easy to teach and the co-op nature makes it very approachable for new players (they don't feel like they're competing against the more experienced players).  Highly recommended for families and groups of casual to moderate gamers.

Pandemic is a quality co-op that works really well with the right group.  I enjoy the light strategy, and the feeling of working together with friends to defeat the board.  It also lends itself to some epic story moments, with the last cure being found on the final turn, just before the cards run out and the outbreak counter reaches 8 and the board covered with cubes.  The expansion adds variety and makes it even better.

The hype killed this one for me. I don't like games that are "hard" because the game gives you a low chance of winning even if you do well to give it a sense of difficulty. I played one game with experienced players that stacked the deck and we still lost due to luck. I will have to give this some more tries before condemning it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A decent purchase at just the right price, I was hopeful that the game's reputation would match my expectations.

Pandemic plays well, and if you're the type that enjoys plenty of player interaction, this is a title you can consider. The overall feel of the game is tense and urgent, as you coordinate with your fellow players and make tough decisions.

Although my friends find this game highly entertaining, I can't seem to love the game as much as I would like to. I find the necessary planning and talk quite tedious; a single turn can sometimes take forever as you plot out the best course of action. Of course this element highly depends on your player group. Winning is hard, and I'm fine with that, but in those occasions when you do win I find it very anti-climatic. The set pieces are nice, not amazing, and the artwork doesn't blow me away either.

In conclusion, I feel the game is at best average. I just find it hard to have fun when I whip out the box.

Decent game. I don't really like pure co-op games as there can be a quarterbacking problem. That has never happened to me, but we kind of all mutually choose the best moves for each other. In that way, we really are just playing against the game and that kind of gameplay I don't entirely enjoy.

RATING: 4
Playing a cooperative game was a cool experience - as it was the first of its sort for me. This had a very cool mechanic in the "intensify" - where you just reshuffle the cards that have already been drawn and add them to the top of the deck, causing already infected locations to well, intensify.

Not always a consistent challenge, sometimes the game simply decided to break you, with no opportunity to salvage the game after even the first or second turn, other times it rolled up and let you run away with an easy victory. For the most part however, it takes some thought to have a shot at winning - you have to manage your risk level, too conservative and you run out of time, too aggressive and you end up burning out on the outbreak track.

Very simple rules, but also a bit too quick to figure out, and the reward for trying to analyse further (which is kind of fun, since you are doing it as a group) isn't always there since you are talking small percentages (in terms of win / loss %). Played it like 8 - 9 times, which is fine, but then it was a toss-up between getting expansions or ridding myself off it and I did the latter.

RATING: 7
2/16/2008: rated 8 after two plays. It's a pretty good cooperative game. It might suffer a bit without the possibility of traitor but I'm not sure. I like the chain reaction of viruses and the building tension. The first game we lost and the second game was won with only one card in the draw pile. 1st game = no researcher and the second game = no scientist. The researcher and medic seem most valuable, followed by the dispatcher, then Operations Manager (or whatever) and last Scientist. Roles make some interesting combos, especially between Medic, researcher and dispatcher.

I do have a concern that this could become easy. Both games were played with the "normal" deck with 5 epidemics throughout 45 cards. 

2 more games, 4-player: 1 win and 1 loss. The second loss was due to both outbreaks and the red virus running out. 1 more round and the researcher would've cured the last disease.

Update: 2 two-player games with the wife. She likes it. It's very good with two, just remember not to be too bossy.

Update: Settled at 7. It's funny how differently I view the roles now. At first the Medic was King and the Scientist the weakest. Clearly, after a dozen games or so, the big power combo is Scientist / Researcher; however, in a two-player game, the medic is pretty grand in that he can treat diseases every two turns instead of four.

Very interesting game that I believe I've explored quite thoroughly. I still have to play it more with my usual group as most plays were two-player with my wife.

Accurate count is probably in the upper 20s.

Game in a Nutshell: Co-op game fighting disease outbreaks around the world. Take on a role, collect cards, and travel the globe fighting the spread one action at a time.

Played as: solo (w/ 2 characters), 2,3,4 player

Played with: On the Brink: Roles and Events (3 player)

Pros: Easy game to learn and play fast. The scaling difficulty makes a good intro game up to a tense challenge for experienced players. Simple enough that it should encourage talking and planning rather then individual situational analysis. The infections work in a way that balances the complete randomness with just enough info to help focus your efforts while still remaining tense with each card flip. This game begs to be played until it's beaten. 

Cons: The game can lead to frustration when played with mixed personality types who are forced to cooperate. After a while, the cooperative discussion becomes straight forward and things boil down to how well the cards play out with the theme seemingly faded away. The base game should have included more roles.  

Other: My advice is play this ALWAYS on the most difficult level. The hooks of this game is in the losses; so don't let newbies win. I'm typically a expansion hater, but this game is one that basically needs it to add the necessary variety for anything more then 5-10 interesting plays (especially if in high rotation)... if only for the additional roles alone.  

Best Use: The friendliest of Gateway games for loud-mouths who don't think they're smarter then everyone else.

One of my gateway games. A nice cooperative game to play with my family. It appeals to some of my non-gamer friends and family members, but to some the game appears to be difficult because of the many different decisions that can be made and the forward thinking and planning needed to beat the game. I am giving this game an 8 instead of a 9 though because after playing with the expansion, I feel that the base game will get boring fast.

RATING: 7.5
The first co-op games I played were Forbidden Island and Forbidden Desert. The thought of working cooperatively with others at the table was foreign to me. My board games roots began with Monopoly and Risk (still enjoy them) so thinking that everyone at the table was there to contribute and work together was mind boggling. Regardless, after the first game I was hooked. What really sold me on Pandemic was when I discovered it could be played solo. I now know that the Forbidden games and other co-ops can be as well but at the time I was coming out of my Monopoly/Risk shell and knew little about the game or hobby in general.

Most Pandemic games I play are solo. It scratches that itch between weekend/bi-monthly game nights with friends. Playing solo or with friends I think the sweet spot for this game is at three players. Two and four both work but something about three seems to just click. With four, the game is more chaotic and I feel that our team is in less control. Too much happens before your next turn. In a two player game, I don’t get that immersive “group think” I do when a third players is added. Needless to say when playing solo I will select three random roles. 

When teaching this game to my family (Uncles and cousin that are part of the Monopoly/Risk group) I had the best reactions I could ask for. We lost our first game terribly. Everyone started shuffling cards and asking for reminders on how to set up the board for the next game. That was the first time I experienced that “Holy crap that was awesome. Let’s jump into it again.” feeling.

15-20 additional games played.

I should point out right away that I tend to not be overly fond of co-op games in general, I seem to always be more drawn to competitive games.

This game is a good game, with a clean and elegant design, it works well with newer players and experienced players alike, and I will play if caught in the right mood. But the mechanisms are a bit too basic for my taste and as I'm not someone who gets into 'themes' in games, there is just not a lot for me here, which is why it ranks so low with me compared to how popular this game seems to be.

This is probably my favorite co-op.  It beats others because it's thematic, fairly quick to play, but provides a good puzzle that changes enough with each play.

The downsides are that it really is a puzzle co-op.  It's like an algorithm that needs to be solved, but it's such a good puzzle that solving it is fun.

The first expansion is all I have, and it's all I'll probably buy.  The added roles and events make the replay value huge.

This game gets better the more I play it, although I'm only up to about six plays, now. However, the improvement is incremental and slowing, so I doubt it's ever going to jump up to a 7. It is, frankly, a bit dry, but not cripplingly so. It's successful for me mainly because, even though it's a puzzle game (and many would argue that there is an optimal move each turn that is fairly obvious), I like the theme and find it the right mix of complexity and playability. It's just a good, solid system that is teachable and playable in a reasonable length of time.

My son and I have played this a couple times. It's not as good as a 2-player, but it's not bad. I'm happy to pull it out now and again.

I've also played it solo a couple times, and it's not bad that way, either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Incredibly well designed, simple rules non-gamers will pick up quickly, and forces strong cooperative gameplay. Good for those people that don't like 'losing' (my other half, for example), as it's an 'everyone wins' or 'everyone loses' game. A favourite amongst my crowd.

Gets incredibly tense on higher difficulties. For added difficulty, play with 5 players rather than 4. The game works just as well, but now the clock is truly ticking.

Given a '9' due to the fixes included in the expansion.

My favorite game (so far) in a genre I don't particularly care for (co-op games).  I've used it to GREAT success as a gateway game for non-gamers, but still have fun playing it.  However, at this point...I really need to ramp up the difficulty for it to be exciting. 

Update:

Still like it, but it has dropped significantly for me...from an 8.3 to about a 7.5.

RATING: 6.5
The game feels more like a puzzle to me than anything else. The means of increasing the difficulty of the game appeals to me less than Flash Point: Fire Rescue.

Hands down my favorite new game of BGG CON 2007.  We played it 5 times in a row -- it's just that good.  Too bad Pandemic won't be in stores until January of 2008.  If you like pure coöp games (Lord of the Rings, Feurio, etc.), this should be right up your alley.  Having 5 roles to choose from gives the game some extra variability.  Also, once you get good you can ramp up the difficulty by adding more Epidemic cards.

This is my new gateway game of choice. It's a great game, has a good theme, is non-confrontational, and has a decent amount of tension.

Others are quick and done, slaughterhouses with little decision-making.

A relatively simple co-op game to learn.  When playing with new players I love to sit back and let them take the lead in solving it.  If you had someone who was too overbearing, they could easily drown out the quiet players, which would take the fun out of it.  It has built in difficulty levels which are hard enough to keep us challenged.

I have the original version, but also log plays of the newer version here.

A few of these plays are solitaire, which I also have enjoyed.

We played this out of the box, first time, and remarkably won ... yes, on easy mode and that's not a bad thing for a game like this which has a tremendous amount of ways to lose - and only a few different ways to win. Pandemic is a wonderful cooperative game that we played two-player ... and it's immersive, a little complex at first with all the things happening - but once you get the dynamics down, it's a challenge to meet the conditions towards victory. It's tough though - and we nearly lost it a few times. The game keeps you up on your toes as you try to keep an outbreak from happening. You maneuver your team to various places on the map to help find a cure - while trying not to run out of cards in the process. 

We're definitely interested in the Legacy versions of Pandemic - as we hear it adds a lot to the game play. An ongoing game - even after you play it once, it carries over to other times you play - which is an interesting game mechanism we have yet to explore. Challenging but an incredibly fun game - even if you lose - you ultimately give it your best shot!!

After approx. 6 plays, my wife and I (mid 30s part-time eurogamers with young kids) think this is a good game, just not one that we would like to play more than once in a great while.   

In general, we are not fans of co-ops (exept for kids co-op games that reduce the likelyhood of hard feelings developing betwen siblings/friends), so interpret my thoughts on Pandemic with this in mind.

Bottom line - we just don't understand the hype on this game...

Cooperative gaming done right. The game scales very well from 1-4 players and the deck "shuffling" mechanism is pretty clever and introduces some nice game play elements - adds to the tension in knowing which cities will (likely) get infected sooner rather than later. Great sense of satisfaction when the epidemic is finally beaten back! Fairly easy to explain - great way to introduce new people to boardgames?

[u]06-Feb-2013[/u]: I think this was the fist co-op game I played after getting into the hobby, and it has spiraled from there.  First, I do enjoy working together with the other players to defeat the game.  I don't have trouble with the "alpha player problem" since I only play with my family and, on the rare occasion, my two buddies.  Second, I enjoy the puzzle aspect of most co-op games.  That is something that attracts me in games.  And finally, and probably most importantly, I can play them solo controlling any number of players.

So, what about this one in particular?  I think it's fantastic.  I like the theme of fighting against ever spreading diseases around the world.  I like all of the various roles (especially when you include the On The Brink expansion).  The "AI deck" is a fantastic, and brutal, mechanism to play against as it continues to add more and more trouble on the map.  The replayability is very high, in my opinion, as the set up varies from game to game, roles mix and match in interesting ways, the difficulty level can be adjusted, and with On The Brink, three additional options can be added to the base set of rules to really liven things up.

I really can't say anything negative about this game.  However, I think you can give yourself help if you "count cards."  Personally, I don't do that.  Of course, I'll have a general idea of what may be coming up next, but I try not to memorize everything that has happened with the AI deck and what is still to come.  I like being surprised and that tension of not exactly knowing what will happen next.  Maybe that's just me.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]:  Man, I can't believe it's been six months since I've played this...what is wrong with me?  Such a great co-op game.  I still hold this one in high regard even though so many co-ops have arrived...and landed in my collection...since.  I would easily recommend this one to any gamer, new or otherwise, interested in a solid, challenging co-op experience.  Oh, and definitely pick up the first expansion for additional options and even more replayability.

I was quite impressed with Pandemic -- it plays really well as a cooperative game and comes with a very fitting theme and a tough winning condition.  I didn't expect the game to be this good.  It was play-tested to perfection.  You'll need both luck, guile and plenty of communication to win after all successful cooperative games cannot be too formulaic.  UPDATE: Second play & I'm already finding that it's starting to lose a little appeal.

2 plays so far, but both were very fun, with each of us chipping in ideas on what we should do and weighing pros and cons. My tip for players to lower the chances of Alpha players is to make it a house rule to let the turn player give his ideas first before the rest can give in theirs.

i am keeping this at an 8 rating, but i believe it is fading for me.  after 20-25+ games, that is not remotely a knock on the game, i just find my interest waning for further plays.  at this stage when i play with new/novice players, i try not to say anything at all and then i realize that i should be playing something else.   again, not a knock on the game which was/is great, i just do not have much interest other than the occasional solo/2player plays.

I was a bit disappointed the first time i tried it. I played alone to test it (simmulating two players) and i was dead before i could do anything about it.
Other times it was way too easy. So far it hasn't been exciting to the very last moment. I conclude it depends a lot on the draw of the cards. But it is fun to play. Certainly not difficult to drag some unexperienced players along to join you.

My story with Pandemic is roughly like this:

1) Ooh, a good cooperative game about healing diseases. My wife might like it.

2) My wife made it very clear that she does not.

3) Time passed.

4) Saw a good offer and bought it. Carefully approached my wife about playing it, starting with solo-playing it in the living room.

5) My wife liked it a lot. Clarified 2) by saying that she simply did not want the game as a present...

6) She recently bought Pandemic Legacy...

I suppose, perhaps, I'm just not a cooperative game player.  This really just leaves me rather bored, and I'm not sure where the game is.  I can see the mechanics, and I think there are some clever ones here, but I don't see why this isn't just a solo puzzle as opposed to a game.  It just fails to engage me.

RATING: 7
Pandemic is the only coop game I've ever played.  I never really saw the appeal of coop games until somebody brought this in to work.  After my first play through I knew I needed to buy it.

In Pandemic you and the other players are all trying to cure 4 diseases before they outbreak too much and just become unmanageable.  You will start with 9 random cities with disease cubes on them, the first 3 get 3 cubes, the next 3 get 2 cubes and the last 3 get 1 cube.  The world is grouped into 4 regions (denoted by colors) for each of the 4 diseases.  The starting cities get the color of disease cube for the color of city they are.

Each player now takes a special role that will help them specialize in things that will help out in the game.  Now the players need to build research stations, remove disease cubes, share knowledge, and eventually cure all 4 diseases.

The difficulty comes from the constant onslaught of disease cubes.  After each players' turn the next cities are flipped over and receive disease cubes.  If a city gets flipped over and it is already at 3 cubes it then outbreaks giving one cube to each city attached to it.  Throughout the player deck epidemics are included, as these come up you get a brand new city with 3 cubes.  In addition all those cities you've already been adding cubes to, yes those ones you've been removing cubes from as well, get shuffled and thrown right back on top to add even more cubes.

This is a rewarding game.  It is fun to work together and not have to come up with the strategy all by yourself.  It might be good to play the first few times with open hands, but I wouldn't do that for long.  It might be easier, but it seems like it turns into 1 or 2 people running the whole game.

I gave this a 7 because it is quick to play and offers a lot of tough decisions in that short amount of time.  If you lose, at least it was only 15 or 20 minutes so you can easily get in another game to try and win.  If playing with only 4 epidemics becomes to easy, just add one.  Once you get up to 6, which is the most for the base game, things get really tough, so you will never feel like this game is too easy.  I love this game and I am really looking forward to the expansion On the Brink.

This board game was my gateway game back into gaming. To be honest, I don't remember what made me want to pick it up, but it's been a staple board game in this household.

It's a cooperative board game that gets slightly harder the more players are in it. Different difficulty levels, pretty neat epidemic mechanic, different roles for each player to play as. This game revived my inner board game geek.

LC- "It's easier when it's played by a smaller group. Once it gets more than 3 people, it takes forever to get back to your turn and try to coordinate what each person should do."

I'm not big on cooperative games, but this is the perfect theme for it.  Several mechanics that dictate the frequency of bad cards make the game simple genius.  

Better mass appeal than fantasy/sci-fi coop games (if you want significant others / family to play).

We play with each player getting 2 random roles and picking one (this is a game, it's about fun, you might as well spend your hour-ish with a role you can get into).

Expansion (On the Brink) adds a lot of enjoyment!  If you play more than ~6 games of Pandemic, pick this up!

You can also make the game more challenging if it's too easy for you by adding additional epidemic cards. This would be a great game to make friends with people you don't know very well due to the co-operative nature!

Pandemic is the best cooperative game I've played - excellent theme, good amount of tension, a sense of accomplishment when we eradicate disease. What more could you ask for?

I have 3 problems with this game.

1)You sometimes randomly lose and there was nothing you could have done about it, period.
2)Of all the games I've played, it suffers the most from alpha gamer syndrome, where one player, usually the most experienced, directs everyone else and tells them what to do. 
3)The expansions are too expensive for what they have. Half of the stuff in each one I do not even want to use, some of the rest is component upgrades or such, but the rest are very well done and give a lot to the game. Meh.

Still a great game though.

RATING: 9
The mechanics are very similar to Shadows Over Camelot. Each turn, you do good stuff, and draw cards that produce bad stuff. The game is a race to complete some good tasks, while constantly being distracted having to prevent imminent disaster. Every player has a special ability.

Two aspects make it an improvement over Shadows Over Camelot. One, the board has geography. In Shadows Over Camelot, there is a cost to move from place to place, which means you have to plan ahead before you go somewhere, to be sure you can stay there for long enough to be efficient. However you can move from anywhere to anywhere. In Pandemic, there is a connection graph, so some places are more costly to move between. You have to consider what you need to do in a whole region.

I also think the roles complement each other better than in Shadows. In Shadows, each role has interesting uses on its own, but there are not so many interactions. It seems like in Pandemic, every pair of roles will have some critical interaction.

Follow up:

I've played a lot more of this. All of the things I said above remain true. In addition, I think this game is a lot more tactically challenging than other cooperative games I've played. A really good tactical plan can really save the day. In the cooperative setting, this is great, as the group can brainstorm and come up with the tactical plan together.

Fast moving and entertaining game, although being a co-op the quieter players will tend to not have too much input. The luck of the draw plays a pretty crucial part in whether you win or not, but this is a good game. The only problem is that when you win, it feels a bit empty: "IN YOUR FACE, DECK OF CARDS!". Regardless, this will probably be the best Euro that will come out in 2008. Kind of reminded me a bit of Thebes in gameplay (with the travelling) and in spirit (fast moving, small range of choices that can have big impacts, chaotic, ease of play, colourful and with a good use of theme).

* One of the quintessential examples of the cooperative genre
* Gameplay is simple to teach/learn, with practically no downtime
* Strategy is basic, but helped by a group that understands that teamwork = victory
* Vets and more vociferous gamers may lead to some bullying, particularly with newbs
* Good for co-op fans and those who prefer great gaming experiences over victories
* Initial rating: [b]9/10[/b]

[size=10][u][i][b]b{Further Thoughts}b (after 25 plays):[/u][/b][/i][/size]
* Base game does get a bit "samey," with the same strategies and roles to blame
* Expansion helps to bring some newness, but starts to overly complicate things as well
* Strange in that, the more a group WINS, the LESS they feel like playing
* Further rating: [b]6/10[/b]

This is the gold standard of co-op games.  The main problem getting it to the table is Pandemic Legacy.  After playing that, it's very hard to step back to the base game.

Update: In fact, I brought out the base game with the same group I played season 1 Pandemic with and it did, indeed, feel very bland and I've reduced my rating slightly because of that.

I seriously don't know what people see in this game. After playing it several times, then leaving it on my game shelf before playing it again I really can't say that I enjoy the game very much. The biggest problem for this is that half of the game you spend picking up cards which you then use to infect the specified cities which results in the player waiting half of the game. If you could eliminate this process and somehow (even though this could never work) make the infection process play out on its own without having to do it manually, my rating would go up to seven stars as that way the game would be a lot more interesting.

 The dynamics that are created between the players due to the rolecards is just superb.
And the shuffling of the discarded infections and putting them on top again after an epidemic deserves the Nobel price for game mechanics.

Rampant diseases and destruction as FIVE diseases rip round the world in Pandemic, played the Bioterrorist from the On The Brink expansion. You might get lucky by curing a disease early in the game, but it will finally become clear you are not going to win. You may even manage to cure 4 of the 5 diseases, but still managed to lose. The game is hard. But super fun. Especially, after years of losing, when you finally beat Pandemic.

Only played two times with two players, but those were a turn-off. It just felt random. The first time we didn't eradicate any disease and they were spreading all over the globe, but apparently we won. The second time we were much more focused and managed to eradicate two diseases, but apparently we lost. The game end and victory condiditions didn't seem to have anything to do with how well we were playing. Also, the theme is thin, it felt more like chasing cubes of different color than diseases. I read somewhere of thinking of the diseases as zombies instead. That would definitely make it funnier.

If Ghost Stories didn't exist, Pandemic would be a 10 for me. However, it's still an easy to recommend 9- great variety of modes and roles with the expansions and an accessible learning curve that can easily accommodate harder challenges when you're ready for them. Still sees play on the regular, as well it should; there's a place for Ghost Stories AND Pandemic in every co-op fan's collection.

Ah Pandemic, the source of MANY hours of fun and also many hours of frustration.  A cooperative game of trying to save the world from disease... and also a game filled with some players being frustrated with seeing the patterns and not wanting to be too vocal; and other players not seeing the patterns and so feeling underutilized.

After playing the game MANY times, with a wide array of different people, I am simply tired of this game.  A fun design, I had a lot of fun, and also a lot of frustration.  Sold at auction.

Pandemic is an example of a 'gateway game', a game that allows new gamers to see what the hobby can be. 

In Pandemic, players work together to eradicate 4 separate diseases from the world. It's very tense at times, and it is always interesting.

As with any cooperative game, there is the possibility for one player to become the de facto leader, railroading the decision making of other players. The best way to avoid this problem is through playing with a group that has the same level of experience.

Absolute fun, the cooperative element allows everyone to have fun equally. Requires a lot of teamwork which really brings everyone together. The game starts off calm enough giving you time to figure out a plan, then the suspense builds quickly and more often than not you have to quickly formulate a new plan. The rules are fairly quickly learned and allows for gameplay to start quickly. Each round takes about 45 minutes which is a perfect amount of time for the tension to build. Overall a great game.

Great Co-Op game that is very easy to learn and quick to play (as long as debating doesn't get too heated).  The main problem I have with it is that, depending on how the deck is stacked, the game varies greatly in difficulty in an unintentional way.  I've had cake-walk games and then there are games in which you don't stand a chance.  If you are playing with new people to the game, the latter results in a very sour taste in their mouth.

Currently have the On the Brink and State of Emergency expansions, I always mix parts of them in to spice it up.

Az egyik legjobb kooperatív társas, amivel találkoztam eddig.

Szabályrendszere nincs túlbonyolítva, a választható karakterek tulajdonságai is jól ki lettek találva, garantált a rémület és a folyamatos feszkó a vírusok üldözéséhez.

Sértődékeny, egoista hülyékkel azért ne játsszuk, csak olyan partyarcokkal, akik el tudnak négyig számolni és képesek alávetni magukat a közös ügy érdekében.

"Klasszik", ott a helye minden társasjátékos polcán, mert ki tudja, mikor kell éppen megmenteni a világot...

The gateway game of choice when playing with 4 people due to the fact that it is:
1) Completely different than everything else
2) Co-op, so non-gamers are not worried about getting crushed by Gracie and I.
3) Plays under an hour.
4) Only confusing because it is so different.  After getting a round in, people realize just how simple the basic ideas are.

This gets a lower ranking though because it just gets repetitive due to its co-op nature.  Thank goodness for the expansion!

Its fascinating how this gameplay took the traditional route and flipped it over. Playing against the board is insanely hard. We have played this game - and almost always lost, but had fun all through the way.

Excellent cooperative game.  Have played several times and have only won once.  Every move is important, every action precious.  The one game we won, we won in exactly the maximum number of actions.  If we had gone one more action, we'd lose.  The last game we played, we chose to cure the blue disease rather than take out a single black cube - and that cost us the game.  It's that close.  If you want a nail-biting game guaranteed to make you sit on the edge of your seat until the very end, this is the game for you.

Having played the Pandemic "system" (including Legacy) nearly 40 times now, I'm never excited to reach for vanilla Pandemic anymore. I'm just not that interested in the puzzle-solving underlying the game as a whole, especially when it's hard to know when you've "really" won or lost due to the randomness of the system. To play truly well, you have to be more committed to solving the puzzle than I typically am. Pandemic Legacy did a great job of using the underlying system to drive an experience, but when you're back to the original, it feels too much like an exercise.

As a result, I had Pandemic at a 4 for a while, but a couple aspects of the game are bringing it back onto my radar. First, it remains as solid a gateway game as ever. We probably prefer Through the Desert, but that game isn't quite as eye-opening as Pandemic's interactive, cooperative nature. It's fun seeing others get excited about "saving the world" and puzzling their way through their turns the way we did when we were first starting out. Second, the underlying system has proven to be remarkably customizable, which opens up not more variety through expansions but also opportunities for my own design tweaks. (This is an advantage Pandemic has over its simpler siblings like Forbidden Desert or variants like Pandemic: Realm of Cthulhu.) I've started [url=http://games.mulrah.com/Board%20Games/Pandemic]thinking through some of these possibilities elsewhere[/url], and if I really get into any of them, the rating here could actually go up. But for now, a 6 seems fair: we're fine with this as an introduction to the hobby, but aren't going to be busting it out all that often beyond that.

I used to dislike Pandemic, until I played it recently.  This games luck factor is through the roof.  If you draw an epidemic card in the first turn, the game is as good as over, and there's almost nothing you can do about it (which is completely random).

Aside from the luck factor, the actual gameplay is basically a semi-interactive simulation.  When I'm "playing" Pandemic, I feel like I'm just watching the game unfold, rather than making influential decisions that effect the game state in any way.

This is probably the least engaging and one of the most annoying co-op games I have played.

RATING: 6
A great theme with great tension, and an excellent gateway game, but also the paradigmatic example of how player quarterbacking can ruin a co-op game.

Infection rates rise and fall, but the board itself is static with fixed movement paths.  Player abilities are variable, but all in the open.  The deck organization makes the card mechanics somewhat predictable.  All these aspects add up to a high probability that the loudest player at the table (or the one with the best memory and spatial awareness) is going to lay out everyone else's strategy at the beginning of her or his turn.  I don't want to be too harsh, because the game was so revolutionary, but there are plenty of other co-ops I'd rather play that dodge this problem.

Great co-operative strategy, although it can be difficult for newbies to get into the game if there is someone particularly controlling playing as well (as is, tragically, so often the case with co-op games).

Old collection

This is our favorite co-op game that also plays well with 2 players. Shuffle more (i.e. 5 or 6) epidemic cards in the drawing pile then though to make it more challenging. The mechanism of the game is really well made: cities that were infected before get a higher chance of getting infected again when the discarding pile is shuffled and put on top of the drawing pile again.

In our games it always lasts until the very end to defeat all diseases or to be defeated by them. And if you defeat all of them, you really feel like you've saved mankind from being destroyed!

Don't know how I got tricked into playing another cooperative game.  I don't like coop games.  This one didn't do anything to fix my largest grievance of these games.  It's just a pre-programmed simulator.  Just figure out the optimal strategy and do that every time.

What cracks me up about this game is how freaked out the players get while playing it. (Are we all gonna die???) That's a sign that the theme of the thing is pretty darn solid. 

I ended up playing this a million times on iPad, with the hopes of understanding and explaining it to the ol' game group. Now I know it well enough that I'd probably end up being the Bossy Guy during a game. So, I'm not so inclined to try to bust it out.

Despite the hype and the high ranking on BGG, this was my main disappointment this year. Everything looks great, the theme is good and we were really eager to give this game a try.

But although we kept on looking, we didn't found a game in there. Draw cards, put blocks, see diseases spreading,.. Sure you can make some decisions but way too little to call this a true hit.

Just like most co-operative games does Pandemic not allow any strategy or deep tactical decisions. Tons of theme but little game. You decide what you want to have fun.

You never really get to make a decision on your own, each turn is "everybody's turn" where the best choice it made for you. It can be a fun experience, but personally not a game I like to play.

A big favorite of my wife. Plays great with 2-4 players. We're doing well with 5 Epedemics, but haven't tried 6 yet.

After playing a few games with open cards, we decided to try cards in hand, and it works much better. We talk about what cures each player is aiming for, and where we could meet up to exchange cards. Otherwise, we each take our turns without overanalyzing each other's cards. This not only speeds up the game, but makes it more realistic.

6/24/2010 - Bumped rating from 8 to 9. Pandemic with expansion is now the go-to game for my wife and me.

I don't much like this game. I feel that game play is a bit automatic: like the game is playing me rather than the other way. I think the problem is that there are few viable choices on your turn and out of the limited number of choices, the optimal choice is rather obvious.  Also, the random order of cards has about as much impact on your success or failure as your own choices!

+1.5 collaborative mechanics work wonderfully and the PvE elements, feel like a real threat without seeming hollow or like we're playing against ourselves. 
+1 sense of building pressure and impending danger is worked into the mechanics fantastically
+1 difficulty is really well balanced
+1 if you have one player who knows the rules well, it's actually very quick to teach a new player just what they need to know

- .5 sometimes strong personalities can take over. While mostly a player problem, some of the mechanics/characters encourage that rather than prevent it

-.5 luck does play a bigger factor than I'd like

-1 Can feel like you're solving the same optimization puzzle every turn (researcher collects cards, medic moves/cures, operations builds stations etc). characters are specialized enough that it almost hinders choices so it feels like you're just prioritizing different severities of the same task over and over... There's still engaging choices balanced well to create tension - but choices can often seem limited. 

A great collaborative puzzle for 4 people to enjoy, with lots of tension and drama woven in. Not for powergamers though.

Co-op game where you try to stamp out plagues.

Pandemic is a classic game and it is still a blast to play.

After a few plays, I love it.  Light enough to be a good family game, and it's cooperative so no one has to get made when someone else wins.  Challenging enough to play with gamers.  My only concern is that it will get stale after repeated play, though it might have enough randomness to prevent that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Warning: this can be an addicting game especially if you suffer consecutive narrow defeats.  The "let's try it one more time" feeling takes over. The variations in the roles and card order make each game a unique and interesting challenge. Adding more players increases the difficulty as does adding more Epidemic cards.  We tried 5 players a few times and that presents the toughest challenge even though all 5 roles are in the game.  This game is quickly becoming one of my favorite cooperative games along with Shadows Over Camelot.

Coraz bardziej odczuwam potrzebę kupna dodatku, bo bez niego już nie mam za bardzo ochoty grać w Pandemię, choć był to hit w moim ,,nieplanszówkowym" towarzystwie i udało mi się sporą ilość osób wkręcić w to hobby właśnie dzięki tej grze (choć możliwe, że swoje zrobił medyczny kierunek studiów).

Pandemic is a great game to introduce to new players who may be averse to conflict in games, but are looking for a highly thematic narrative. The tension of the card draws drives Pandemic and causes players to sweat, hoping that any one of a handful of cities on the brink won't topple over the edge into a morass of widespread contagion. There is a bit of a *potential* problem with quarterbacking, where one "alpha player" can drive other players... but a strong host should be able to disarm that.

Wahrscheinlich das beste Kooperative Brettspiel, ohne Verräter Mechanik. 
Eine gefährliche Krankheit rbeitet sich rasend schnell aus. Die Spieler übernehmen die Rollen von Ärzten, Wissenschaftlern und Logistikern, um eine Pandemie zuverhindern.

Außerdem lässt sich der Schwierigkeitsgrad anpassen, so dass sowohl Einsteiger, als auch Fortgeschrittene Spieler eine angenehme Herausforderung verspüren.

A very good coop game in which players battle to contain and eradicate global diseases.

The word 'elegant' is often used in the comments for Pandemic and its easy to see why. The game is genuinely simply to play and at the same time a stroke of genius in working to convey its theme, with a good level of tension and a fair difficulty threshold. Its also insanely popular- nobody dislikes this game, and its popular with hard core gamers and casual gamers alike.

The co-op style of play seems key to this game's appeal, and depending upon the group dynamics you may find this one sails or sinks accordingly. Prone to follow the leader, especially when playing with veteran players. Also not sure victory is possible with some career draws. 

The expansion 'On The Brink' is also fantastic.

I prefer the elegance of the base game, but do add in some aspects from On the Brink.  Seldom used and now never use In the Lab, even with hard corps devotees of the game.

Played this a couple of times now, certainly one of the most difficult PvE board games I have played.

Another game that tends to be swingy. Either usually win easily or get crushed by the viruses... viri? Whatever.

It's a good game, but it's been replaced by other games.

Forbidden Island distills the Pandemic experience down into something simpler.
Defenders of the Realm pumps Pandemic up on steroids.
Flash Point: Fire Rescue is roughly the same time and complexity, but adds an element of tension that just isn't present in Pandemic.
Freedom: the Underground Railroad is also a puzzle-solving co-op, but is so much more satisfying.

RATING: 7.8
Its fast and tense and the teamwork is a lot of fun (with the right people). Sometimes a session quickly turns hopeless but at least its easy to restart. Probably not for eurosnoots or those who think the height of boardgaming is Monopoly. I must get a copy of this one if for no other reason than to lure potential geeks into the hobby. I can see this game being easily modified with custom rules, especially the role cards.

>>Am getting a bit lukewarm about this game. The mechanics are brilliant and there is good tension in the game. The main drawback is that it is prone to alpha gamer (mainly due to their superior experience) making most of the important decisions, overtly or otherwise, leaving less dominant players or newbies with little or no meaningful role (which might be perfectly OK for some groups). As such, its collaborative but not quite. On the Brink, with the terrorist, fixes this problem.

This was the first super successful co-op game on the market, although Lord of the Rings pre-dates it and would have done ok too.

Players must work together and make use of the abilities that their role offers them in order to save the world from a series of infectious diseases. 

The game works brilliantly on two levels. Diseases have the ability to spread and break out based on where they occur on the board and the deck of cards is constructed in such a way that locations that have seen the disease will appear again within a given timeframe, which can then lead to outbreaks.

It all adds up to an experience where the players know the clock is ticking but they aren't quite sure when the timebomb will go off. They then have to make the right choices to juggle the multiple threats and they only have limited resources with which to to do. 

Brilliant although can be dominated by an experienced player - so get the playing group right and ensure that decisions are made by the group.

With open information there's always the risk of it devolving in to one player leading the group. Even when this risk is avoided I'm not a huge fan: the mechanics of the game don't really appeal to me, I find the colour scheme ugly, I find the game quickly gets repetitive (this may mainly be due to how I feel about co-op games though as it's the influence of other players upon your tactics and strategy that makes competitive games so engaging for me) and the end result often feels driven by luck as much as good tactical decisions. Also in some respects I'm not a fan of how they applied the theme.

The boardgame core mechanic I've played the most, simply because it is so easy to take out and teach to people (plus the Legacies), while being very elegant and tactic. The fact that it is a co-op adds to this, because the more timid people get to win or lose as a group. The same fact went for myself, too, back in the day. "On the Brink" expansion makes it way better and adds some much needed flavor.

That being said, Pandemic Legacy 1 (and 2) kind of destroy the base game for me, as I don't feel any need to play the base game ever again.

Great co-op game that takes a lot of teamwork to get through, depending on the difficulty chosen. Some character abilities seem over powered, and especially when you combine the most powerful ones, the game becomes almost too easy in some cases. That being said, I've played with 4 players one day (and I mean FULL day) and we could not win. Once we didn't even get around the table before we lost. Player 3 and 4 didn't get a turn. Challenging game that takes some brain power. One thing I don't like is at some points, you realize there is no way to win. You don't trigger a loss, but if you count the cards left, or you know a card is about to be drawn that will trigger a loss, it's a bit of a bummer, but outside of that, love this game.

There is something to be said for simple game design. This game has just the right amount of rules to envoke the theme, but not too much to get bogged down. The down-time is almost non-existent due to the players being so involved in solving the puzzle (which eradicating the viruses to some degree is). I still prefer Defenders by a mile, but I can see why Pandemic has such a broad appeal.

If you are someone who doesn't like waiting for others to make their move when you've already found the best one, then stray away from playing this game with a group.

Very overrated. You can try to figure this game out as much as you want to, but in the end the game has enough luck to where it won't matter if you make the best move each and every time. Incredibly frustrating when you aren't getting the cards you need, or, worse yet, someone is quarterbacking the whole experience. I will only play Pandemic solo at this point, and even then there are better games out there.

Would rather play Flashpoint: Fire Rescue.

I like this, and have not yet suffered from the 1-dominant-player issue which can dog co-op games such as this. Just knowing that can happen and with strong moderation by some of the gaming team should be enough to make sure it doesn't become a solitaire game with spectators.

Aside from that comment it has a wonderful virus-growth mechanism which takes players by surprise on their first game. A really good idea well executed.

After playing this game thoroughly I have decided to review it. I have played it with several groups of people and everyone settles into the cooperative aspect quite well. I won my first game last night with four people and I have to say after about seven losses with that very same group we were thrilled. High fives were in order. There are few games where as a group high fives are in order. And becasue this game is one of them it deserves a 10.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cooperative games often suffer from issues like alpha players, scripted gameplay and luck feasts and I seldom see the point in playing against a game instead of playing against humans. However, Pandemic turned out to be a pleasant surprise.

The mechanisms are simple but with many interesting applications: the game board consists of connected cities and cards are used both for actions and for telling which cities are hit by diseases. So far nothing interesting - gather cards and use them to move and fight diseases.

But once epidemics erupt, previously drawn disease cards are returned to the top of the stack, giving all players (even newbies) a fair chance to predict the next wave. If left unchecked, chain reactions will spread diseases to nearby cities with sometimes dramatic results.

The players must constantly balance short-term disease treating (to avoid letting the situation go out of hand) against long term cure researching (to fulfill the victory conditions) and the tension and engagement is high throughout the game. Even lost games are fun and the quick and short gameplay invites repeated plays.

Finally a cooperative game I can appreciate!

Saving the world from translucent cubes can be harder than you think!  I love the theme of this game!  It's an exciting co-op puzzle game with a unique mechanic of a deck that will run out and end the game, making for a limited number of moves and a timed game without rushing anyone.  I continue to play this off and on, and each play through I like it a little bit more!

My first taste of cooperative gaming, and an encouraging one at that.  The idea of uniting against the game seemed odd, but is carried through here with aplomb.

Played a solo game a while ago and it was quite fun. I have discovered through various playthroughs though that I am not really as big a fan of Pandemic as I thought I was. I much prefer other games in my collection.

This game is brilliant in all the areas that count. It is a fantastically designed game and one that must have been truly groundbreaking when it came out. For me the mechanisms involved in the epidemic cards were a moment where my brain almost exploded in how simple and clever it was. In spite of my awe over the design of the game, it is not a favourite and rarely gets played these days.

Pandemic is a fantastic, exciting cooperative game! The game has enough variables that we seem to be racing against a different threat and in danger of failing a different way every time we play.

Pandemic can rightfully take a decent hunk (though obviously not all) of credit for the resurgence of board games in recent years. Pandemic was one of the first games to really nail co-operative play in an accessbile fashion. As a team, you play various operatives fighting to keep a global pandemic from wiping out most of humanity. The only way to succeed is by planning ahead and communicating with your team-mates. It's a refreshing change from a lot of games where players go head to head, and a great amount of fun. It's crushing when you realise you can't stop the oncoming tide of the virus... but when the penny drops, and you realise that if you play the next turn in a very specific way you can win - it's immensely satisfying.

Très bon jeu coopératif, mais les jeux coopératifs ne sont pas trop mon genre!

En fait, ce jeu fait ressortir les traits de personnalité et le type de leadership des personnes autour de la table. Pour ma part, je sens que je serais plus à l'aise à jouer seul à ce jeu, ou alors, avec d'autres personnes qui le connaissent bien (mais pas trop!). Je n'aime pas donner l'impression d'imposer mes points de vue... ou vice-versa!

Par ailleurs, étant donné que tout le monde joue sur le même plateau, et que celui-ci sera progressivement recouvert de cubes, il aurait avantage à être un peu plus grand.

Tried Pandemic and liked it, but don't need to add it to my collection though.  A good game, not a great theme, and not for me.

Pandemic is simple to play, simple to introduce, and incredibly challenging. It's also a lot of fun. There's a strong luck component, but unlike games like Settlers, it's somewhat controlled. Usually, though certainly not always, if you know something bad is coming, you're able to address it, or at least to mitigate the effects. Every role has an ability which adds to the whole; there's no real weak thread. I've never picked a role and thought, "Well, so much for this game." Having played it at least a dozen times, it's still a challenge, and still entertaining. The expansions are great too. I love cooperative games, a relatively new discovery for me, and Pandemic is my favorite of those. The .5 points off is entirely for the tray in the box, which is terrible.

At this point, there isn't a whole lot of people who haven't heard of this game. It's successful for a reason. Very solid Co-op game; it's one of the best in the genre. For many is it the best. For me, as much as I do enjoy this game, there are games that perhaps the only reason I would rate higher is because they are more fun for me specifically. I've got no problems with this game, but I just like Shadows Over Camelot better. I don't really have a reason why, but it's probably the only thing keeping this from a higher score from me.

Good game that was an early part of my game collection.  While I enjoy it, it has lost some ground over time to titles I find to be more enjoyable.

The cooperative nature of Pandemic offers a welcome break from the tension of competitive play as everyone joins forces against the game itself. The game engine is a well oiled machine designed to keep you on your toes as your team struggles to keep the constant spread of disease under control. The game plays well with 2 through 4 players with each number providing its own unique challenge. The varying roles make each game different, adding to the game's overall replay-ability. While luck can be a significant factor in determining the outcome of the game, this doesn't seem to matter too much as all players win or lose together. This game is just plain fun.

There were co-op games before Pandemic, but Pandemic is responsible for co-op games taking off in popularity, and with good reason.  If you like the idea of a co-op game, there probably isn't a better one to start with.  Pandemic has far better decision making than the other games in this series, and those are way better than Flash Point.

Well, I had this at an 8 for some time, but I HAVE to bump it to a 9 now, for the very reason that every single person I have introduced it to absolutely loves it. Including... get this... my grandmother. I enjoy it quite a bit, but my friends and family seem to like it even more than I do. My one issue is that I enjoy losing this game more than winning it - it's much more dramatic. Winning is usually quite anti-climactic, and everyone always sort of looks around and says, "That's it?" Whereas losing always has everyone excited and emotional. Maybe my friends are just weird. I'm  also not so sure about the re-playability, it's starting to feel a bit tired even after 7 plays. Hopefully the expansion will cure this disease! (groan)

UPDATE: Tired is right, bumping it back down to a 8. It's clever, but the urge to play it has almost entirely died. I haven't even tried out the expansion yet, because it just doesn't seem worth it. 8 might be generous at this point.

When this game first came out I followed it closely.  I even listened to a Google Talk that the designer of the game gave.  Honestly, I didn't get it.  I couldn't tell if it was just another one of these co-ops that ends up being *essentially* "Go Fish" (e.g., Lord of the Rings, Shadows over Camelot).  Also, there were reviewers who were writing that every play was obvious and mechanical.  Well, I played this for the first time at GenCon '09.  Z-Man had sold out by the end of Saturday, so I bought a copy as soon as I got home.  It's that kind of game.  In ease of rules to interesting outcomes, I'd rate it similarly to Ticket to Ride.  The rules are incredibly simple, and very, very tight.  What the rules don't capture, though is that ambiguous dimension of tension.  Some games are able to produce it, some aren't.  Pandemic's the latter.  This was true of a bunch of adults (at GenCon), and has been true with my two daughters (11 and 14).  It's a similar feeling to Twilight Struggle: you never have control over the board, and things can deteriorate very, very quickly.  Me, I like that kind of game, and I'd rank this as the best pure co-op that I've played so far.  Finally, it is simple enough that my daughters have pulled it out on their own when their friends have come over.  I think Z-Man has got a "classic" on its hands here.

I can't pinpoint it, despite the group I play with loving it, but this one is not my cup of tea. It just feels like a boring exercise and doesn't push my buttons and causes me to feel like I'm really not engaging my brain much at all. Maybe it's the randomness of draws??? I don't know but this one is not a fave.

Great design, but I'm not a big fan of co-op play. I think in order for a pure co-op game to appeal to me it would have to find a way to give each person a piece of the task that they have to do on their own, either because of hidden information or because the entire task is far too complex to be handled by one person.(Or because your teammates may be giving you bad advice because they're cylons! But that's team play, not co-op)

Amoung my first co-op games. Having fun playing it in the beginning. Nice components and nice theme. All the mechanisms cohesively support the theme. After awhile, however, realized that the city card mechanism doesn't fit well with the theme and so I couldn't immerse myself into the game as well as before. Alpha males and females also make this game mind numbingly boring. That is why it is a 7.

In this cooperative game, players take on the role of medic, researcher, operations expert, dispatcher or scientist to combat 4 different diseases affecting the world. Players have 4 actions on their turn, to move, build research station, slow the disease or find a cure. Epidemics can break out and spread around the world. An excellent, fast paced game. A realistic mechanic is where the diseased cities are shuffled back in to the top of the epidemic pile. You feel like you are running around, with hardly any time. 

This is a very fun, addictive game. You keep wanting to play, to improve your play, and win. A side note, our gaming group has three copies of the game, and two of the games have duplicate cards. One of the games has a duplicate Khartoum infection card, and another game has a duplicate Los Angeles draw deck. Check your copy to be sure!

This game has provided some of my best ever gaming experiences. It's great when a group of people is brought together over the course of a game and, in the end, are all on the edge of their seat every time a card is turned over. There have been gasps and groans and cheers, and, when we beat the game by the skin of our teeth, sighs of relief. It feels like a real collective achievement when you win, and that's brilliant.

I think my biggest complaint about the base game is that I just do not enjoy it with only 2 players.

Pandemic maintains a sense of urgency in the face of growing crisis, and demands closely managed risk.  But you can't control everything, and there's a good chance it will all unravel before the game ends.

Having previously played Forbidden Island, Pandemic plays very naturally as the obvious parent.  Hand management, infection and epidemics have near replicas in Forbidden Island, while outbreaks progress in an obvious (if scary) way.

In Forbidden Island the game mechanisms match the theme - aided by it being an obviously contrived world.  In contrast, landing Pandemic in the modern world suggests a simulation, which it still could be if your knowledge of disease ends in high school and the evening news.

Play is abstracted from CDC operations to the point where the theme feels pasted-on, and you could just as easily be stomping terrorist insurgencies, mitigating the spread of refugees, holding back the collapse of the banking system, or delaying any other clustered anomaly.  This shouldn't detract from the game - unless you're playing it for the theme.

Most popular cooperative game on the market and does deserve the merit it receives. Accessible, thematic, social and enjoyable. Expansions are a must for regular board gamers.

It was an okay cube-pushing game. Cooperative is a neat idea, but I'm not sure its for me.

EDIT: After second play, main issue I have is alpha gaming. If you play with a group that lets players decide a lot for themselves, great. My group had an issue where players kept arguing over best moves and coercing others to follow a certain plan. This created higher downtime for me who wants to just progress and NOT optimize every step.

I wish the game came with a small sandtimer that lasted 3 minutes or something. I don't like being timed and this is a human problem, but it is annoying that you can optimize every step of the way and it drags. Also, epidemics are pretty luck based IMO.

Pandemic is currently the only co-op game in my collection. I don't particularly like the genre because I have been indoctrinated that gaming is about beating someone - and that someone is not the game (I came to boardgames through trick-taking card games such as Whist, rather than RPGs, the latter genre would probably have made me more open to co-ops). This means I will never be completely sold on Pandemic, it's not my perfect game. BUT it is a good game nonetheless as there's plenty working for it. It is a short, clever game that has an engaging theme that seems to entice beginners, and it plays very well with two players. I love the short set-up time and the mechanism of how the outbreaks spawn. The downside is that it feels more like a puzzle than a game for me;  it's mostly about tactics with quite little strategy; and after a while it feels a bit gimmicky.

Typicle co-operative game with the typicle sideeffect: The expert could direct the game. I take to hold off in  co-operative games, don't give tips don't tell my combatant what to do. So its more gameplay for evryone. It's a fine simulation of an epedemi/pandemi good working mechanism, good gametime. The game variede better than other co-operative games. We always play in the difficult levil hard and wehen we win it's realy curtly, what makes the game thrilling. I give 8 points for all.

RATING: 8
Such a good game.  Plays great with just two people, easy enough to play the base game solo (controlling 2 or 3 players yourself).  Good way to introduce people to board games, especially since it's a co-op game and the theme is easily understandable.

What I like best is that you can change the difficultly of the game, and more likely than not the game wins.  Sometimes it opens a can of whup-ass and gives you a double serving!  However it's alway enjoyable win or lose and it feels like the game challenges you to beat it.

Can't say I like the new art on the 2nd edition so I chased down a 1st edition, the map looks so much better and I appreciate havng wooden pieces instead of the new neon plastic ones.  Impossible to get expansions for the 1st edition.  However you can buy the new 2nd edition cards to upgrade the 1st edition directly from z-man games.  If you do this you can use the 2nd edition expansions being released now.

If I could get more people to play the game I would buy the expansions, at least On the Brink.

Neat co-op game that packs a good amount of fun into a modest set of components.  It can end rather abruptly, but in a co-op game, that matters less;  you can just play again.  None of the five roles is really weak, but the Medic seems to be the most useful by far;  the game is a lot tougher when he's not around (and it's pretty tough to begin with, mind you).

Cooperative game where everyone takes on a specific role and tries to fight several different plagues around the world. Several variants offer an easier or more difficult challenge, though luck plays a big role in how difficult the game is.

Played it three times a day for a few days when I first bought it! Love the gameplay, found it very cooperative, and love the fact that it's tight: Current score: Pandemic 11-11 Humans.

The game equivalent of 'The Fifth Element' for me - you forget how good it is until you play (watch) it! Never anything short of excellent, and I should play it more...

RATING: 10
So good and so difficult to be good at. Read the directions carefully as many people out there claim to beat it regularly but do not play according to the rules. It is very team oriented and would be a great game to play with family as the stronger players can help out the weaker. Highly recommend.

RATING: 7.5
A fun, thematic co-op that escalates tension nicely. It's generally more fun to play with open information and discuss moves as a group, even if this is not strictly allowed in the rules. The infection mechanism, in which the discard pile is placed on top of the draw deck, is at once innovative, thematic and simple. The On the Brink expansion is superb, and I never play without at least some of it.

RATING: 6
This is a fun light game that I really classify as a "filler" game.  It's a very good game to start off a gaming night, or between games.  The mechanism of dispersing diseases out onto the world is simple and surprizingly good.  A small work of genious for that part.  I believe the game is best when played with all Epidemic cards, as I feel that the game is just a tad too easy without them.  Fun, short game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The first time I played this, I hated it. One of the guys was a control freak and pretty much told everybody else what to do. Luckily, I was willing to give this another chance and I was able to see how much fun it could be. It's nice that all of the cooperative games are very different in feel and mechanics.

Not really sure what the appeal of this one is.  I enjoy co-op games but don't like the theme or look of this game.

A very fun co-op game. It's great for introducing non gamers into the hobby. Each time I play the intense feeling of impending doom never ceases. Have yet to beat it with more than two players. With it being a co-op you might have problems with alpha gamers taking over and telling people the actions they should take, I just squash that before we play.

Pandemic ranks as perhaps the best game I have ever played. The basic rules are elegant and intuitive, the cooperative format is welcoming and friendly, and the roughly 90-minute play time all make the game extremely approachable and convenient. Elements of randomness never feel as though they override good strategy, but demand that those strategies constantly adapt to the changing situation. The difficulty is also quite high, but is widely adjustable (especially with the various expansion components) and ensures that even experienced teams will never find the game trivial. 

Exceptional!

RATING: 8
The ultimate gateway game. If you ever have people over and want to get them all playing a game this is it. The new version looks fantastic, especially the translucent cubes.

Pandemic's theme is something everyone can understand and no one will take offence to. People will spend time during their turn and other player's turns talking through what everyone should do. That said it can fall victim to having one or two players simply telling the others what to do, so it's worth mentioning.

I've been playing games forever though and I still love playing this one, with new gamers or experienced players alike. Definitely worth buying.

Pretty good. My only experience with this game was on tableotop simulator with strangers, so my opinion should certainly be taken with a grain of salt. I enjoyed the experience despite us losing.

I will say, I've heard experiences where people lose on the first turn because of the card they flipped, which is lame, but it's still good.

A co-op puzzle. Stare at the board and find the right answer (but together!). I'd play this more often if anyone in my group liked it. My issue is the lack of tension (as with most co-ops). Space Alert solves this problem and is a much better "team-building" exercise in my opinion.

A 4 player game of Pandemic on a hard difficulty with players who are really determined to win is simply one of the best gaming experiences out there.

I have played so many games of this where we either won or lost by such a slim margin. 

This game is intense, elegant, simple, and so strategic. I love playing this two player with my wife after the kids go to bed. It's just great trying to solve the puzzle together.

However, the best and most challenging way to play this game is with 4 players. You have to think out every move from the beginning especially at the higher difficulties. This is by far the most played game in my collection.

Looking forward to the expansion coming soon....

RATING: 9
A really nice co-op game, with a refreshing theme: Save the world from four epidemics. Players move around the board, trying to keep the diseases under control, while also searching for cures.
The players use cards to move about the board quickly. However, the same cards are also used to cure the diseases, creating a really interesting resource managing dilemma.

Cards representing the cities on the board are used to spread the disease. As the cards get cycled back ON TOP of the deck, the epedemics keeps getting worse all the time. Brilliant!
Also, this measn different cities will be hot spots in each game, so there's a lot of replay value.

Players also get five different roles to play for added variety.

Like all co-op games, it's quite hard, constantly handing it to us even on normal difficulty. We are barely able to win on normal difficulty, so I can't immagine how the game is supposed to be beatable on hard difficulty...

Having played some more, especially after adding the first expansion, I've decided to:

Increase the score 8 --> 9!

I absolutely love co-op games. I love the idea of everyone taking on a common enemy.

The best part about this game is the necessity to pay attention to cards in hand, what's on the board, and what's coming up. You only have so many actions on so many turns, so you better do it right.

I am no longer capable of playing this game. I'm very well aware of how the game plays out, so I know some of the best moves in any given situation. And thus, I can't give advice, because I'll just run the show. If I "help", I have fun, and no one else does. If I don't help, I don't have any fun.

Initially we found this fun to play but noticed it was more a group planning game than a game, and really there's very little variation in how the game strategy turns out.  The range of easy/boring to impossible/frustrating was a huge turn off.

For our group we had the good fortune to discover Flash Point: Fire and Rescue and it unfortunately for Pandemic we have played it once since owning FP:FR and it confirmed how much better Flash Point was.

This game might be rated higher as a solo game because there's little deviation from the group strategy once it has been established taking a lot of the co-op aspect out of it.  There is zero individuality in it.

Pandemic is a great co-operative game with a unilaterally acceptable theme. The integration of theme to gameplay is a little abstracted though, but mechanically very functional.

The only negative factor about Pandemic is the ending, whether a win or a loss, has an anticlimactic feel. The condition for victory being just curing all 4 diseases, rather than having to eradicate them, usually leaves the world roiling with infection even though the game has been won. It feels somehow... unsatisfying. 

Chose to search for a 1st Edition of Pandemic purely because I don't like the pompous cover art on the 2nd edition.

I find this one boring. I also find Forbidden Island dull but at least there's less hullaballoo in it. My dissatisfaction with these two specific games has to do with either something in the nature of co-ops or in the specific way that the disaster events are actuated by reshuffling the discard deck. I thought it was the former (since I didn't have fun the one time I played Flash Point either), but then I played Hanabi and really liked it. Maybe it's that you can probably play Forbidden Island, Pandemic, and Flash Point as solitaire games (and in a group it ends up being hive mind solitaire), but by its nature, Hanabi must be played with other people.

I like Pandemic a fair bit. The mechanics of the game really enforce the theme wonderfully, and the game presents a challenge but is beatable. We have played mostly on Normal because Heroic can seem a little hopeless although the one time we did we barely lost. The components are nice and simple. It does seem like a puzzle to solve rather than a game sometimes however. I LOVE the game whenever I am the dispatcher, and really enjoy the endless possibilities open to me. Unfortunately, games where I'm not dispatcher are not terribly interesting to me now. I loved playing it at first but I am giving it some time before I open the box again. Considering buying the expansion. 

Edit: Giving myself some space helped me value this game more. I think it still suffers from what I mentioned before but I can approach this with more excitement than I did before. I should get the expansion! Sigh.

Difícil um tema mais atual. No Pandemic, cada jogador representa um especialista em um determinado assunto, e o time tenta evitar que doenças extremamente contagiosas se espalhem pelo mundo. Bom para iniciantes, mas é preciso ter espírito de equipe: um que não consiga se integrar pode acabar com qualquer planejamento. E já são duas expansões: uma torna um dos jogadores um bioterrorista.

I have played this twice solo to get the feel of the game.  I absolutely love the ramp up mechanism that creates an escalating tension in the game from start to finish.  I won the first, but lost the second, as the Black Death took over in the Middle East (ran out of cubes).

I finally got a chance to play this with other people.  It lived up to my expectations - a really good game that is cooperative and accessible.  The group included what I consider non-gamer types, including my wife.  She likes Hive, but not enough to suggest it during off hours.  The others have played Settlers, but absolutely disliked PR.  They all have biology interests so the theme intrigued them.  We played the introductory game and by the end, were getting the turn rhythm down.  But we lost by one turn!  We ran out of cards.  Everyone wants to play again (especially me!).

Why this is not a 10:
->  I do not want to play this all the time, mainly because it is a cooperative game - I prefer competition a little more.
+ The mechanics are really cool and the theme fits for me.  I have no problem suggesting this, especially because I think I can get a game going with my [mostly] non-gamer friends.

Good Lord, this game gets tense.  It really builds to a spectacular climax, right down to the wire.  We just barely missed saving the humans from the diseases!  Such a result is probably healthier for the planet in the end, anyway, so it's OK.  ;-)  I think they should have marketed this game with little .5 ml microfuge tubes instead of cubes.  You can get them in all the right colors, and it would fit the theme beautifully.

Didn't like, don't care for genre and like less when "helped" overly much. Have no desire to ever play again and it's even boring to hear about. But I'm not too fond of the latest round of "cooperative" games, so I may be overly prejudged here.
My comment on these anymore is, "sure, and go ahead and play my hand too."

RATING: 7
Really intense and challenging co-op where players are required to work together to win the game. A great gateway game as well due to its simplicity. Great and easy AI mechanic makes this game shine.

Qualms: Too little roles and after 20 or so victories may seem to be a tad repetitive. I have heard from many reviews that the expansion solves this issue but I have yet to own that game.

RATING: 7
I understand why it's already a classic: great theme, easy to learn rules, quick pace, nice components, scalable difficulty, playable with all type of gamers and non gamers...

Still, placing the shuffled Infection Discard pile on top of the remaining Infection Draw is a mechanic that doesn't convince me; I understand it's necessary because othwerise it would be too easy to avoid outbreaks, and it also fastens the pace, but it also creates some non desirable (for me) effects:
-> All the action of the games happens on very specific places; lack of movement through the world
-> Favors the creation of fixed strategies that you'll carry from one game to the next (creation of investigation centers in affected cities to move quickly between spots, etc.). 
-> If 2 epidemy cards are very close one to the other, you'll face a big problem; if this happens twice...

At the end of the day, success on games [for good or for bad] can be determined solely by the [random] placement of the cards.

Still, it's a game I love to play from time to time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very good, short cooperative game. The theme fits cooperative game perfectly. Deadly diseases are a perfect faceless enemy for a cooperative game. One nice touch is the fact you can make game easier/harder easily depending on players skills. 

Update (13.2.2009): After few games Pandemic feels perhaps a tad too deterministic to play. It's still a very fun multi-player puzzle to be solved and because of a great theme it's one of best cooperative games I've played. Pandemic also suffers from "one player can play game" -syndrome most cooperative games seem to suffer. This isn't as big minus if all the players are about as loud and as "good" in the game.

A very quick cooperative game. The disease mechanisms are very clever. The game seems to have decent replayability because of the random setup. There's a mean balance between the roles: No matter which of them is out of the game, you always feel so screwed.

Very good component quality, even though the wooden bits are a bit large for the map. The box is very sturdy, and delightfully small.

Overall, a nice production.  The insert is "meh" at best, but the components and board are nice, so it's a reasonable trade-off.

The game itself is strong, with a lot of things to consider, and a neat card mechanism where certain "trouble spots" keep cropping up again and again instead of random outbreaks everywhere.  Very unique.   

My only complaint would be that the game feels a little too short, and the ending a little bit unrewarding.  These complaints are only a small problem though; they certainly don't destroy the game by any stretch.  

This game deserves the praise it is getting, and you should own a copy.

Absolutely love this game.  I can understand when people say it may get repetitive and definitely encourages the "alpha" player, but this is still one of my favorite games to play with my family (and we hardly ever win)!

The complexity can be a little daunting to new players, but once you get it, the game really starts flowing.  The theme is amazing, as you always feel like you really are fighting a losing fight for the survival of mankind.

Definitely  recommend picking up the expansion as well.

I can be wary of cooperative games, as they can suffer from "boardroom meeting syndrome", but Pandemic is pretty good fun and short enough not to outstay it's welcome. And if the cards beat you, there is generally enough time to have another crack at saving the world.

RATING: 9
I seriously don't think I have anything new to say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece.

My full review is located in the In The Lab review.

So I will say this.  In the Lab improves the base game.  I don't play the base game and refuse to play it without the expansion.  Does that mean Pandemic base game was released 'incomplete' without the devices/mechanics of In the Lab?  Absolutely not.  Pandemic the base game plays very well without it and is very immersive without In the Lab.

That's why I speak so highly of the expansion because it some how pushes an amazing game even higher!  So buy Pandemic.  If you like it then get In the Lab.  [On the Brink is really just for players who want an even larger challenge].  In the Lab can increase the challenge, but really, it just makes the regular play experience better.

Non adoro i cooperativi, ma questo titolo mi intrigava. La mia delusione credo è legata anche alla monotonia della partita. Il meccanismo per la verità riesce nel suo intento di ambientare il gioco, il tutto però è troppo ripetitivo. Quattro o cinque azioni a disposizione, il più delle volte suggerite da chi ha più esperienza con il gioco e non troppe scelte da prendere. In sostanza trovo molta poca strategia ma solo un po' di tattica in base alle carte pescate. Il gioco può essere modulato con diversi gradi di difficoltà, generalmente questo può rallentare un po' il successo o addirittura portare ad un fallimento che però è spesso più determinato dal tipo di carte pescate che da effettivi errori strategici. Non il mio genere di gioco ripreso in mano dopo anni solo per ripassarlo in ottica Legacy dal quale mi aspetto in realtà molto.

RATING: 4
An excellent co-operative that doesn't feel like the more traditional games of this genre (notably LoTR and Shadows Over Camelot) because of the swift pace and less need for players to confer. Tidy, simple but effective mechanics keep the disease cubes spreading and means that players can't afford to stagnate. Surprisingly tense stuff too as you reach the final stages. It looks like the expansion will help to customise this a dozen different ways for all levels of difficulty and enjoyment.

Further Thoughts: Lacking in longevity, it would seem. We've done all we can with the game, and it looks like we might be going back to Shadows Over Camelot. Downgraded from 9 to 7.

My first real coop game and still one of my favorites. The theme is just very nice, the mechanics make sense and it just feels like you're really "fighting" the game. 
It's easily scalable without really changing the game flow and thereby easily transitions from a game you can play with new player to a game for more experienced players that are up for a bigger challenge. 

(When zman brings out the 2nd expansion I need to somehow ask i they have the replacement set as I still have the old Pegasus version of the base game and the 1st expansion)

A Co-op? or cooperative? WTF?... so wait... were not playing against eachother?... were playing together against the game? bullocks!

I was very skeptical at first... but the one play i played did sway me... So it seems that the game is tough at first, but  after learning how to "cooperate" you get better, and then can increase the difficulty accordingly... (sweet!)

i heard that the creater created this game becasue he wanted more games that he could play with his wife (great idea).

i recomend this game on the basis that it's different, fun, and "cooperative"... (i also heard that some couples play agricola "solo-mode" cooperatively... i will be trying that out hopefully really soon)

i could play this again, but hopefully it will be at the gaming group when my wifes there (i dont want to buy it unless she likes it... and the upfront rules are a little much to get past, but by no means difficult)

Pandemic is a strategy game that provides players with the chance to work together to solve the puzzle of curing all the diseases before you fail in one of many ways... 

I truly enjoy the myriad of ways you can play this game, the changes in difficulty from learning to Heroic mode, the different characters, and the chances you have to take to win. Once played through, the mechanics become understandable and teachable to others. This is a game with a lot of potential for repeat play and is easily digestible thanks to the short time frame of around 45 minutes and the cooperative play approach.

Interesting co-op game, and unusually one that supports just two players. That in itself is enough to warrant a place in my collection. The game itself appears to be an, at times, very tense race against time. Early thoughts are that some of the role cards could be a little imbalanced - though I stress that these are only very early impressions, and I'll certainly be playing it more to make a decision one way or the other about the roles.

Edit: really enjoying the challenge. Whilst I still think some role are stronger than others, there's no doubt that they all have their place and uses at certain times. Rating increased accordingly

RATING: 7
Perfectly balanced, excellent challenge scaling, but at the end of the day it's lacking in depth and doesn't make you feel like you're uniquely contributing to solving the game. The roles are shallow and hardly different, and with all the touting of this game to be one of the best games ever made, it only lives up to that title in terms of how streamlined it is. As far as the FUN factor goes, it loses its charm after about 5-6 plays.

[b]Pandemic[/b] was sold via auction (2013).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Haven't played this in a few months and every time it gets brought up no one wants to play it. Just didn't connect with my family (most co-ops haven't).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (7):[/COLOR]

[i]So far I like the game, but I can't help feeling a little disappointed with this game. Probably because of all the hype surrounding the game. I also find the theme a bit bland. This is a game I always play it with my wife and kids. We have fun when we play, but it does not get suggested a lot.[/i]

It's a lot of fun, but it's basically a logic puzzle at heart. It's also limited by its replayability, but it's a great game to get people into cooperative strategy games. It's a fun theme that many people can get behind, and once the bird is set up it isn't extremely complicated to play. High on my list of recommendations.

I love this game. It's frustratingly addictive and I probably get too invested in it. Some people have expressed their distaste for it being more like a puzzle than a game, but that's one of the features I really enjoy about it. My friends are a very competitive group and this is an easy co-op that gets us working together instead of at eachother's throats for once. My boyfriend and I always have fun even playing just the two of us. Definitely a keeper.

[b]Pandemic[/b] is cooperative game where the players work together find cures for four different diseases.  Each player is dealt a different role which all have their own unique special abilities, and each game begins with randomly chosen infected cities on a world map, so each game plays differently.  Games last about 30-45 minutes.

There are three different difficulty levels controlled by the number of "pandemics" you add to the draw deck.  I don't like varying difficulty levels in games.  You don't feel any satisfaction if you can beat the game on the easy levels, and you wonder if you really know how to play the game if you lose at the harder levels.

So far I've played all of my [i]Pandemic[/i] matches at the medium difficulty level and have won less than half of the games.

The game that really got me into boardgaming. This game has never been turned down by anyone new to boardgameing. and for that it should get the most praise.

It's just such an inviting combination of theme and mechanisms. Sure there are much better implementations of theme in other games and sure there are better coops. 

But Pandemic just nails the accessibility, so that your non-gamer friends can join in this wonderful hobby!

The artwork in this game is beautiful. However, don't be fooled by the attractiveness of the rule book's pretty colors: for a game this popular with relatively simple rules, this may be the worst rule book of its kind, starting with reverse type and continuing with a  layout that jumps around the pages, adding to the confusion of an underwritten booklet. 

Don't believe me? Look at the sheer number of rules-related windows on Forums (December 2016), and the unprecedented numbers of videos trying to show how to play. Had to use videos and consults rules questions on BGG to clear up several rules questions. I was able to rewrite the rules for how to play onto one page, with 12-point Verdana, and half-inch margins. But it took hours of viewing video and reading through rules forums to figure it all out. 

On the other hand, having already owned and played the same designer's similar but less complicated "Forbidden Island," I didn't find the game particularly difficult to learn, and, with a handle on the rules, felt I could also easily teach it.

Purchased new for 25% off at local Target, December 2013. I own the 2012 2nd Edition.

Played twice with 6 year old. Most of the time felt like I was playing the whole game by myself. The challenge was figuring out the optimal moves based on what cards we have in had as well as our individual powers. Lost the first one by making a big risky move and also using two underpowered characters (generalist and Dispatcher). Won the 2nd one by getting a valuable free research station special event card right in the nick of time as well as using 2 of the best roles in the game (medic and scientist). Will continue to review the rating with subsequent plays.

one of the best games i have played, my wife and i find it enjoyable even if we loose and immediately want to replay it. it's one of those games i enjoy more the harder it gets. i also love the fact, that the mechanic is relatively simple and you don't know what lies ahead of you, so you can't memmorize the cards that will be in play. this makes it easier for new players to catch up with experienced ones and makes all the opinions at the table valid.

WOoohhhhh! This is one seriously scary game! Another awesome cooperative style game. You must cure the 4 deadly viruses from around the world (Anthrax, Ebola, Typhoid Fever, and Smallpox) before time runs out. We have now played several games! With 2 players you can win a good bit of the time...but our games with 3 to 5 players are more intense and challenging! There are ways to win under normal or heroic conditions...but you need a fair bit of luck on your side, the right conditions, and a clever combination of roles! Simple!...No way! But always...always a great game, even when we lose!

This is OK because my extended family really appreciates working together with the various roles.  The roles work well in facilitating interaction.  The game play gets less intriguing after 5 or 6 games, but as I said, it's a nice little vehicle for cooperative play.  When you are working together, the tension can get fun when you know a card that could cause a terminal outbreak could come out this turn, but you'll be able to prevent it next turn if it doesn't.

Not too impressed.  Nothing much to this game, as far as I'm concerned.  The map is ugly, and my wife hates the theme so much she refuses to play.  A different and richer theme would be a big help.  For a co-op game, I much prefer Lord of the Rings.

It's okay and I'm engaged the whole time. I usually play with 4. I just worry that the outcome may be determined more by the draw of the cards than by smart play or teamwork.

It's more of a multi-player puzzle than a true game. Another thing to note is that with true games, as you get better, your opponents also tend to get better. When you are playing against a random number generator (like Pandemic), it takes the same approach every time (random), it doesn't think and it sometimes coughs up easy combos, sometimes impossible draws. 

This is more akin to playing "solitaire" or "spider solitaire" on a PC. There are different situations you can be in (without knowing it at the start): sometimes you win with no trouble, sometimes the setup is impossible due to the shuffle of the initial cards. You don't know which situation you are in until you play it through. The activity of playing it through can be fun (I occasionally play solitaire on PC while waiting for other things to load), but it doesn't change the fact that whether you win or not is almost completely random- it was based on the cards, not your decisions.

Bought Jan 2009, Sold Feb 2011 after realising I don't like pure co-ops or the randomness.

Found it on sale on Amazon for $25, and since my four boys (ages 10-16) and I enjoy playing games I figured it was worth a shot.  One of the best game investments I've ever made, no question - to the point that when I found Pandemic: On the Brink on sale I purchased it for the point in time when we're ready to expand.

My 13 year-old is very particular about what games he likes to play, so he's usually my litmus test.  The only one who didn't like it was my 16 year-old, but he's at the age of not wanting to spend time with me anyway, so I take that with a grain of salt. :)

The first game took about an hour as we figured out the dynamics and game play.  Needless to say the outcome was not in our favor - despite an early eradication we quickly lost ground.  After that we were able to sort through the best way to leverage the various roles' strengths.

This is one of the few games that, even after a rocky start, my boys kept asking me to play - THAT is a win.

The only downside thus far (and it's a stretch) is that role combination can swing things pretty substantially.  But it's a small downside, and if anything makes it more challenging.

I played a game at a friends place and was hooked. Went out and got my own copy.

Nice artwork, good theme, straightforward gameplay.

I find I'm playing a lot of collaborative games lately and Pandemic is a great addition.

It gets requested regularly at the moment, and once we start playing it becomes very addictive :-) Great replayability.

We find it a great introductory game for non games. My daughters (aged 11 and 8) also love it - so it has become a regular family game.

A cooperative game that may be fun.  The theme is strong and enjoyable, and the game plays quickly.  I gave the game a higher rating than I wanted to in order to compensate for the strong cooperative bias I have.

A Great Gateway game for a multitude of reason into both the hobby and the co-op genre. Co-ops in general make great gateway games because new players are able to be coached along because of the win or lose altogether mechanic, but this game takes the cake. This game is easy to teach and learn because the concept is based in our present day and easy for people to grasp and relate to. The game setups up easily and provides clear instructions for new players to follow. With in mere turns anyone can grasp the game and start making decision for them selves and contributing to the outcome. This game also has a relatively short play time which is always a plus when introducing new player to the hobby or gaming in general for non-gamers. Me and my wife being avid co-op players do not find this game to be much of a challenge but it is a nice escape from some of the more stress inducing mind bender co-ops that we play. I rate this game so highly simply because of its utility as a Gateway game for which it fires on all cylinders. Also this game is readily available via major shopping chains.

100+ plays across its various incarnations. The more I play this, the more interesting it's become. It's a collective race against time kind of thing. Do the best you can with the cards you get dealt (literally and figuratively) and you'll either win or you won't. But some nice strategic and tactical decisions along the way, even though you might only be able to tell the best moves in retrospect, and a lot of the decisions are reaching a consensus on the best risk management play. Nice length, with a "next time we'll do better" feel.

RATING: 9.5
Wonderful game - great sense of escalation.  It is always a climactic ending for us - whether we win or lose. We can usually find the first cure quickly, and things can be quiet until you find the second one.  But if you feel you've had a break early in the game, things will ramp up pretty quickly after the second cure is found.  Even when  things are quiet, there is tension because you know something big is coming. This is a sign of great design.  This is my opinion after about 25 plays. I feared that it would get stale as a 2-player game, but I am happy to say it hasn't been so.  We regularly play on level 6 with the base game and level 5 with On the Brink.  It is also great with more players.  A little more difficult, as you each have fewer turns and need to coordinate very well. But you have to play with the right group:  don't play it with alpha-gamers or people who are sensitive about others offering suggestions.  It will mar your experience with this game if you play a game like that early on.

Seriously this game is all about luck.  I really don't get why it's rated so high, I honestly regret my purchase.  

If your an avid strategy gamer, you'll find most choices obvious.  Worst case, you'll end up carrying all other players, making choices for them.  Whether you win or lose is all about what roles are handed out and how fast epidemics come out.  

I don't play this game sober.

Great, Fun, Challenging Coop game.  You must plan and work together or perish.  The game is brilliant, but has specific rules which many people get wrong.  Therefore, this isn't for everybody.  Might be considered a gateway game for the right teachers and learners.  Get the expansion On The Brink - you won't regret it if you enjoy the base game.

Played it a few times before we actually bought it.

The quintessential gateway co-op game that does have enough variability to warrant replaying. That being said, having gone through Pandemic Legacy Season 1, it just doesn't have the same suspense element.

For what it's worth though, it was a great game when it came out and provided years of fun.

Great game. Easy to explain and easy to play. Tough to master though and the sense of logistics comes on really nice! The mechanic for the virus outbreaks is great too! This is a really nice co-op game! Loved it and am eager to play a few more times.

One of the best aspects is how little time the game takes. Can't imagine it taking longer than the 45 mins claimed on the box!

- Rules are well written. The may be a few ambiguities though, but for now all seems good.

This game is the standard for cooperative games. It gains a lot in its Legacy version.

Thumbs up: Cubes as diseases (sometimes I'm even afraid of touching them), great 'Artificial Intelligence'.
Thumbs down: If you a have a dominant player in your team, it's easy to become a 'follow the leader and he/she decides everything' situation.

RATING: 5
Not my cup of tea. There are more enjoyable games then this where 2 or 3 players in a group make the decisions, especially with players who don’t know the game and play for the first time. Had the same feeling with games like Arkham and Eldritch horror. 
Dead of Winter, Shadows over Camelot and Legends of Andor are definitely better games. Didn't have the feeling I don't know what is going on, let the seasoned player of this game do my turn. I even prefer Flash Point, Hanabi over this one, and for the same reason.

RATING: 4
First play with 2 players on easy was fun, but we were close to winning. Started over to add third player (normal) and that ramped up the fun and tension considerably. We lost the game within 40 minutes! Can't wait to try again. Never played a co-op game before and this genre hits a sweet spot that is sorely missing from my games and all games in general. I hope designers pick up on this mechanic and run with it!

Update: Our second 3 player game was so tense, such a nailbiter to the end, that I got a stomache ache. I love it! We had one round (six card draws) to figure out a way for one person to give another person the needed cards to cure the fourth and final disease. We threw strategies back and forth, and at one point seemed so close to a solution, but to no avail. The last infection draw of the game caused the final outbreak, and we lost even before we could try for a cure. This game now goes up to a 9, my first 9, based on the excitement of that 3 player game. 

Update: game quickly lost its appeal.

A nice premise, fundamentally flawed in a mechanic that essentially drives the game on rails, limiting choices to a very narrow set based on the situation. Not much decision making, mostly just reacting to what the game throws at you according to the best possible strategy which makes itself obvious. The rest is down to luck. A broken, boring game.

The game is very easy to teach, plays well and fast, the tension building up as the cubes mount and you race against the game.
Solid production values, I guess the cards could wear from the shuffling.
Like all co-op games could be prone to a dominant player running the group but due to the ease of play I think most people can contribute and thus hold their own.

• Downgraded back to 9 on 19 Sep 2016 after 30 plays. That is a ton of plays and I still love the game but it isn't a 10.

At first I was completely against the pseudo-multiplayer the Leackock system provides.

Now I feel that there is no game that can replace Pandemic. 

The theme is strong and engaging for players regardless of age, sex, gaming experience and general interests. It's a hit every time. If I have doubts concerning the way my game night will evolve I get Pandemic from my shelf. 

It will never be my favourite game but it seams it will be my most loyal soldier. I believe a must have even if you don't like it that much. It's a great tool.

*** Convince players to hold their cards in their hand, so they are forced into participating in the conversations about how the team will act (sounds stupid but works).

I like this game a lot.  This is probably the ultimate co-op game.  A few of my friends don't like this game for that very reason; there is no individual winner.  You all lose or win as a team.  That's it.
The components are basic, but gets the job done.  It's meant to be a little abstract, and I can appreciate that, especially considering the subject matter.

Always really fun and engaging, love having to work as a team and it's funny seeing alpha players emerge.  Everyone that plays gets sucked in and asks to play again immediately.  It's the most fun you'll have losing (over and over and over again)!  Best part about the game is that it's really easy to explain to other players and to pick up if you haven't played before, and it doesn't take a long time to play (excellent gateway game).  Can't recommend it enough, absolutely one of my favorites!

I'll be honest... I haven't been "excited" to play Pandemic for a while. This is mostly because of newer games (to me at least) that I really want to try out. However, I generally play whatever my friends ask for in order to avoid turning people away from playing with me. That said, I always enjoy playing Pandemic once it's on the table. It is a quick game with lots of decisions and tension.

Alright, I admit.  This game can be addictive.  We played 6 games last night.  And it can be difficult, especially with 6 epidemics.

I haven't finished playing this one out, and I am looking forward to getting the expansion at some point, to mix things up a bit.

After purchasing this game six months ago, we finally got to fit it into our rotation. It went over big. After losing to the viruses in the first game, it was decided we had to play it again. We were one turn away from making the last cure, but we ran out of cards from the draw deck.

I know this game will be in our rotation again, since we talked about different strategies for the next time we play.

10 plays - Nice solid design, though am surprised to see this game so overwhelmingly/ passionately loved by so many. Ultimately, winning will be a mix of good decisions and non-punishing deck draws. The game strikes this balance really well, creating a very nice tension. The different player abilities (and combinations used between games) helps create replay-ability, as does the variable ways the world can become 'infected'. It can become victim to the 'alpha' player, but ultimately I feel that is more of a criticism about who you play this with, as opposed to the game itself.

Excellent group game.  The mechanics for the virus spread are simple but implemented effectively.  The benefits of each player's role weight minimally into the game, but allow for some variation and sightly more elaborate cooperative efforts to leverage those perks.I highly recommend the game to folks looking for something you can play together and cooperate instead of compete.  Both 4-player games we played took about an hour, I would assume less players would make the game go quicker.

By the way, for a relatively cheaper priced game the components are top notch.  The cards and board are of a good weight and the pawns/pieces are all wood.  My copy had some pieces missing, but the company has responded quickly and I assume my replacement pieces will arrive soon.

This is one of the best co-operative games out there and it can be played by almost anyone. The mechanics are simple as you perform 4 actions a turn to prevent outbreaks and cure diseases. It is great for getting new people into games as it plays easily  in less then an hour and has a great theme. However after about 25+ plays I am at the point where if I play with regulars we win every time and if I play with new players I cannot speak as I will basically play by myself, so to let them figure it out I only comment sparingly. I still think it is a great game and suggest it to others but I no longer need it in my collection. You could get an expansion after a lot of play which does add some neat new features and mechanics.

Non andiamo pazzi per i giochi cooperativi, ma Pandemic ci piace per qualche buon motivo: ambientazione originale e assolutamente attuale, semplicità delle regole che non diventa banalità nel gameplay, giusta tensione durante ogni partita e durata contenuta.
Per godersi una partita, è consigliabile a mio parere giocare un po' di ruolo: "ho tre blu, chi mi da il quarto?" ammazza letteralmente il gioco. Infine, risente pesantemente del Grande Problema dei Giochi Cooperativi: se tra i giocatori emerge un leader, la partita sarà un solitario con tre burattini e un burattinaio.
Merita comunque una onesta sufficienza.

Good game. Would get to the table more but my brother got a bit wore out on it. He is a weird bird, since he is extremely smart, and easily the smartest in our group, but he doesn't enjoy super analytical or strategic games. He much more enjoys the easy going Ticket to Ride style games and social deduction games.

Would be bad if you have a bunch of those alpha gamer types, which fortunately we don't. Just let new people reason through the moves themselves.

2-4 players: Awesome.
Any other count: C'mon.

One of those games that I never really ever suggest playing (possibly because it's a co-op), when I do play it though I really enjoy it.

Don't even start with the Alpha-Player argument! 

As an Alpha,having played this game enough times to buy a replacement, don't be a schmuck-ask players questions,include players, and let players play.  By the 3rd game, most players have found their voice and have caught on to the game.  The only times I have ended up grossly Alpha-Playing is when I teach the game to a whole group of new players.  Don't do that.

The great thing about this coop game is that the randomness is predictable and risk assessment good.  At first, it seems like the cards are stacked against you; but as you master the game, you can make calculated risks and weigh your choices.  This means that your choice has value.  When we loose a game, I can generally point to a choice we made that didn't pan out during the game.  That makes me feel in-control; unlike Robinson Crusoe. Additionally, it is that weight and calculated risk that keeps good-players guessing, there is no standard tactic, obvious choice, or methodological mechanics that makes the game rote for good-players; unlike Castle Panic.  This means that every game is different enough so your choice has meaning and your decision will shape the game.  That is a difficult balance in coop games.

Suggestions for Alphas: 
1) Don't teach a whole group of newbies-they will all look to you for decisions, letting you play the game for them.
2) Introduce the game to a group with another player who has played the game.  Let that player go Alpha, you get to be the Obi-wan of the game and be a mentor.  Hint-Ask questions of the new players.
3) If you are introducing Pandemic, then just introduce to a single newbie.  Play the two player game, it will be quick and you can play again, and again, and again, until they really start grasping the game.
4) Don't be the Scientist, Researcher, or Medic; make the newbies be those characters.  These characters abilities directly affect the game and bring a sense of glory during a loosing game.  Contingency Planner is always a good character to take when teaching the game.  
5) Throw the first game.  If the group easily wins the game, then most players will dismiss Pandemic; probably because someone Alpha-played.  If you loose, those competitive players' aggression starts to come out, and then they want to beat the game.  With a bit wise mentoring, these players can encourage other players' voice.  By the end of the night, you got a group of coop gamers talking over each other. Just lovely.

Too much groupthink and hand-showing are required so this isn't very interesting from a decision-making point of view.  See Battlestar Galactica for a co-op game that still allows for some fun individual play.

As cooperative games go, this one is pretty fun.  It really feels like a race against time to quell the disease faster than it's spreading.  If you're a fan of cooperatives, this one is sure to please (though it does have the one-player-dictates-to-everyone-else issue).  For me though, cooperative isn't my favorite style of play.

Played once during a co-op triathlon with a single puppeteer. Never quite grasped the requirement to cooperate in an unspecified code. "Can someone pass me a card that's the same color as the alternate home sweater of the Nashville Predators?" We're all gonna die.

This game will not be much fun if there is a player who dominates the decision making processes. Also, the rule that states that players cannot show their cards to each other but can say what they have makes it just as if every played with their cards face-up on the table.

I'm not a big cooperative game fan. Choices are obvious and, in my group, agreed upon somewhat democratically. There is no information that is hidden (a drawback for me).

RATING: 6
Pros:
+Tough game that can be very challenging to win
+Nice map artwork
+Components are nice, wooden bits are fun.
+Interesting theme

Cons:
-Can end suddenly
-Can be impossible to win
-Gets tedious after awhile, needs expansion

Edit: After playing this again after about a year of sitting on the shelf. I actually quite enjoy it. A '6' is the perfect rating for this for me. It's a tough game but the only thing that kills it for me is the "co-op" part of it. It can be very one sided in that fashion. I feel as if I have to be in the right mood for this game. It does play nicely solo though and it's just long enough to keep my attention. Still would like the expansion at some point but it's quite low on my priority list.

One of the best cooperative board games of its kind. The mechanism and rules are very simple to understand and it has a theme that is challenging, yet suitable for a family game. If you enjoy such games, you should definitely give Pandemic a try.

A unique characteristic is that it features various "difficulty levels". If you get bored by beating the game easily, try putting in more epidemic cards. Things will change.

Only one bad experience in over 20 games and that was when I was trying to teach it to a new group of gamers and within the first two turns we had continuous outbreaks that meant we lost the game (the only time it's ever happened) - I've never been able to play it with them since.

On the whole very enjoyable and at times very tense

I bought this game based on the recommendations of others and a pretty big whim, thinking the cooperative aspect would be something fresh.  Boy, was I right.

Great balance, a fiendish difficulty, plenty of randomization, and an unprecedented level of cooperation make this one of my group's most-played games.  I've played Arkham Horror and Battlestar Galactica.  Both games pale in comparison.

Unfortunately, a couple of factors prevent me from awarding Pandemic a 10.  It is too easy to get lucky or (as is more likely) get screwed over by the randomization in the game.  Also, a lot of times there is a clear path that the players should follow, so you can lose a game while feeling that you never did anything wrong.

Pretty good cooperative experience. I like the rather high difficulty. Some roles are imbalanced and there is quite a bit of luck. I doubt if I would like playing this with strangers or people who I know little about. An obnoxious personality could dominate the game and end up telling everyone what to do which would be annoying. With agreeable people; however, the game is decently agreeable in that player's must cooperate to shape a winning strategy. Long term planning is usually pointless as the random card draws will often derail your intentions. The challenge is constantly reworking and adapting. The theme comes out in the gameplay fairly nicely. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I expected more. Whole game seems to be an easy math exercise. Every round there are only one or two real options, so it seems that this game plays you, not the other way around. The mechanics works well, but I think this game lacks in theme. If you are looking for a co-operative game I would recommend Arkham Horror over this one (thematically better,	although the mechanics are not so neat).

September 2011: Bought it used for 5 euros.

RATING: 7
This game is responsible for drawing a bunch of our friends into boardgaming -- being cooperative, the new person doesn't feel left out in the cold, or that they shouldn't ask what to do next.  Plus, it's that new person (whether new to boardgaming, or new to Pandemic) that always asks to play again -- the game has an incredible "hook" factor.

That having been said, I fear that with an experienced group the game is approaching being "solved", with the only tension being whether the cards are going to dictate a win or loss by the appearance of the epidemics.

This game has a great tense challenge and tough to the end.  I love how it's always variable and for a coop game, down to the wire in many games.  I find we lose just as much as we win.  I love the variable difficulty setting as well.

The one minor issue is that it can be dominated by an experienced or "strong" player, removing quiet and new player's chance to play their game.

1/20/10: I really liked this game when I first played it, but subsequent plays have tempered my excitement.  The game feels too mechanical to me now.  I feel like I'm just going through the motions.  I like that it is very playable in solitaire form, but I never actually choose to play it when I'm alone.  My friend still loves it though, and he'll always ask to play it.  One thing this game does do well is create tension; I'll give it that.

It's mostly tactical, as I think good cooperatives should be, there are a lot of interesting decisions and it's very easy to get anyone involved in the action. I think Ghost Stories is the deeper and more interesting game, but this is much better suited to play with non gamers, and it's a really good game also. Really, really like the outbreak mechanic. 

Very nice!

An 8 with the expansion. A good co-op gateway game with challenge. Good play rewards you with winning perhaps half the time. Mistakes will lose you the game. Not very forgiving. The game is more deterministic than Flashpoint: Fire Rescue.

RATING: 7.8
Only giving this a sub-8 because the character selection can screw your chances and the map can really blow up in your face without warning, leaving you with nothing to show for the past hour or so. 

I definitely prefer this version of the 'sinking region' mechanic over its developer twin Forbidden Island. Better visuals and feel, plus you don't have your way out sink on you out of nowhere. :)

This was one of the games we tried not long after trying Carcassonne (played this first in Dec 2009). I read about Pandemic on BGG and thought it sounded cool. And it is! We like it with 2, 3, and 4 players. It is important for me to keep from bossing the other players around so that everyone has fun. I like how we all have different abilities, and the decisions seem deeper than in Forbidden Island. We have more to consider.

RATING: 7
Not many good co-op games exist but this one is one of the best. A simple game which can be easily explained and therefore played by almost anyone. Players can be replaced easily if somebody has to leave the game.

It's a tough game. Your most dangerous enemy is time (in this game too). But again, co-ops need to be tough. It's fun to lose together!
Also the theme appeals me: curing diseases. Of course it would be nicer to save the world everytime but hey, no one is perfect.

I'd really like to play more, this one was as good as I expected it to be. The only thing that prevents it from being an 8 is the mechanical approach. I'd like a bit more immersive action.

We played the first game a little wrong, but caught ourselves after the fact (we did not remove all cubes of one color for 1 action @ a city after the cure was found)  We lost that game, but played the second game correctly and ended up curing everything!  Teamwork shines through in this game; highly recommended.

Subjective:  -0.50  As cooperative games go, I find this to be more of a multi player logic puzzle than a game.  Arkham Horror on the other hand, is unquestionably a game.  Perhaps great coops fall between this spectrum?

I will go down as a martyr here, but Pandemic just doesn't seem like a game to me. Granted, there are decisions to be made and player interactions to be had-- but really it just feels like one big logic puzzle to me. A puzzle does not a game make. Before somebody charges me with co-op rage, I love cooperative games. The active word being "games"  Cooperative puzzles, not so much.

Games differ from puzzles through:
Player interaction.
Dynamism.
No predetermined outcome.
Superior involvement of skill and chance.
A more active agent of antagonism.

I consider Pandemic to have little player interaction, be very static, and have a relatively predetermined framework within which the players muddle about believing that they can control the outcome. Chance and skill are severely muted within the context of Pandemic, and the agent of antagonism doesn't impress me, because after all it is just a sequence of shuffled cards that regurgitate. Sounds more and more like a puzzle.

Read this quote from Wikipedia on "Jigsaw Puzzle Strategy"...
Quote:
The most common approach to building a puzzle is to start by separating the edges from the inside pieces. Once the edges are built it can become easier to move inward. For those new to puzzles, it is recommended to choose one consisting of multiple areas with contrasting designs and colors. This enables the narrowing down of potential portions of the puzzle where a particular piece will fit.

Some people like to use the picture on the box to help solve the puzzle. Once you have completed the edge, if you can find the location of a particular piece on the picture, you can place it down inside of the overall puzzle at approximately the place it belongs. If you do this enough times, you find pieces eventually will start fitting together.

Another approach is to sort the pieces by color, and work on one color at a time. When you get to large areas with the same color (such as the sky in many landscape puzzles), you can go by shape, or you can place all the pieces in a grid and approach the problem by taking a piece that already has an anchor (such as an edge piece) and trying it against all the pieces laid out.
Strange, but this sounds an awful lot like a game of Pandemic.

The worst part is that you might even be working on a puzzle that cannot be won, so Pandemic probably does not fit the standard for even the most sadistic of puzzles. It is like a jigsaw puzzle that you are working on, and when you are looking the other way, the dog comes in and scarfs down a few pieces. Am I going to keep working the puzzle, or am I astute enough to sit up and take notice that some of my pieces are missing at this point so I might as well chuck this whole "Pandemic" thing in the trash and go play a thoroughly enlivened game of Twilight Struggle?

Also:  HOW IS THIS GAME RANKED SO HIGHLY ON BGG?  FOR SHAME.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After many plays, this is settling at a 7 for me. The game plays quite well and I love the production, especially the bright disease cubes and the infection cards. The spreading infections and sudden epidemics make for a dynamic and tense experience and the various role combinations tend to require different strategies. I've had great success introducing this game to people. Even folks who groan "cooperative?!?" end up loving it. Highly recommended as a gateway game. I'd pull this out over something like TtR or Carc without a second thought.

It's not an 8 or better for me because I now often have to bite my tongue during games to keep from directing newer players - so much of doing well simply follows from having played enough times to have "solved" the optimization problem the game presents. I do enjoy it, though.

Really liked this cooperative game where you work together to fight diseases. It has a great mechanic that really fits the theme: Epidemic cards that cause you to reshuffle your infected city discard pile and place it on top of the deck. The whole game intensifies and things start to snowball quickly. Very enjoyable!

We have been playing this nearly every day since we bought it.

I'm not real keen on this, though it does seem to get a lot of love from my more casual gamer friends. I feel like it's really more of a solo game, played en masse. That leads to a single player, or a group of players, who are more familiar and seasoned telling the rest of the gamers what to do and when to do it. It lacks a sense of satisfaction. The random nature of the outbreaks makes it a real hit or miss experience for me. It's not a bad game, and it's generally really well received. It's also not a terribly long game, which is good, but if I'm choosing myself I'm not picking this game very often.

I'm finding I don't have the patience for co-op games, unless there is a speed element or hidden information.  I would rather solve the puzzle myself than sit around discussing our next move. Too long for the randomness generated by the cards. Yet, strangely, not swingy enough for me to feel the drama.

The co-op play makes for a friendlier atmosphere than most games.  This game can create some really tense situations.  The only draw back to this game is that sometimes the game can be over in just a few rounds.  Boom, outbreak in africa.  Boom, you are dead.  I understand it is part of the game.  But some of the other players were ready to quit after that happened.

RATING: 3
There is a tremendous amount of unavoidable randomness. I prefer games to end with the feeling, "I wish I had done this differently," but every game of Pandemic merely ends with, "I wish this had happened differently." Whether it's drawing two epidemics in a row, having an immediate unavoidable outbreak following an epidemic, or having all of the cards of a certain color at the bottom of a deck -- there's just so many factors which can lead to a game loss being completely out of your control.

Besides that, the amount of agency each player has on the game is practically zero. You can go for a 15 minute smoke break and come back and see what players have decided for you to do on your turn. Perhaps in this way it's a "true cooperative" game, in the same way Solitaire could be a true cooperative game. But I strongly prefer cooperative games like Hanabi where players are forced to make their own decisions.

[b]A potentially great game where the immersion is ruined by character selection issues due to a lack of all male characters and no way to choose your character.[/b]

Pros:
* Great theme and production quality.
* Great board that gives the game a nice tactical layout.
* Variable roles with different abilities makes you feel like an actual team trying to fight a pandemic.

Cons:
* [b]-1 for potentially being forced to play as a female character.[/b]
* -1 for not having any choice of your character at the start of the game.
* Forced limited rounds by running out of player cards is lame.
* Petri dishes should have been included with the original game to store the virus tokens.
* Without any expansions the game gets very repetitive, [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/40849/pandemic-brink]On The Brink[/url] is an essential expansion.

I only recommend getting the latest edition (2012) as the component quality is phenomenally better than the original.

Fun co-op, and I play it solo as well. Feels like trying to beat your luck with the best strategy you can come up with within the cards that you are dealt with.

However, the fun level depends on the group that you play with, and some people will find the theme "dull" and "boring" so it is not a cup of tea for everyone.

---- Update ----
This game is not for the competitive at heart! I can't get them to like this game as much as I like. The desire to bring this out is less and less.

---- Update ----
Traded this in a math trade because can't hit the table at all with my brother and sister-in-law and I am tired of this "puzzle".

I've tried introducing friends to gaming with Pandemic and it's not the gateway game it's cracked up to be. 

But that being said, if you like games and understand some mechanisms etc etc... it's a lot of fun. It can be brutal, but it's not often crushingly brutal, even with all the green-meanies shuffled into the deck.

Clever game that works nicely.  I'm always eager to find more working co-op games and this one fits the bill, though as I play it more it feels more abstract (and after playing Forbidden Island, one can see how quickly the theme can be re-pasted).  Need more plays to see how it stands long-term, though I like it so far.

I liked this game a lot when playing with four players, but recently tried it with two and discovered that it was LOADS of fun! I think a big part of that was that we were both kinda gunslingers who go on gut feeling. The first games involved a mini-dictator in the group and that puts a natural dampener on co-op games.

This is the best cooperative game I've ever played. When I got this I wasn't sure if it would hit the table all that often.

[Update] On the Brink expansion adds a lot to this game. A definite must-have.

This is a contemporary co-operative classic. It's a good gateway family game, for people that like co-ops. But it does suffer from the 'coaching' problem: a lot of the time, one player will just become the group captain, dictating plans to the other play. The game then becomes a solo game played by that person, while everyone else just executes that plan.

I really don't know why people love this game so much. I find it pretty underwhelming. First off the player(s) that have played before pretty much have to tell new players what to do, so the new players are just extra hands at first. Second, I'm just not afraid of cubes spreading and don't know why we just don't call this a game of set collection, with maybe a loop or two. I can't see why we don't ignore the outbreaks for the most part and just focus on set collection, since that is winning the game mechanic. Finally, had I realized the game would end with the deck, I simply would have asked for the total number of cards in play and divided by the number of players, so people would know the exact number of turns available to collect the card sets. I can see how this would have limited interest as a solo-play game, but it just doesn't grab me like it does so many others in my game group. It may partly be the theme, but it is also the game mechanics - I don't really like Forbidden Island either, which I understand is by the same designer and has the same sort of feel only a lot shorter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Not overly complex, but still requires good team work and tactical considerations. I fully agree with the statement that it is probably the best coop board game out there. The only flaw of this game is that if you play with smart players, you will usually end up agreeing that a single course of action is the best - and end up taking it. Sometimes you will lose games even if you made no mistakes. Although the game is randomized by the cards, players have only one objective and heavy gamers may find this a little light.

On the down side,The game is Really challenging,Im very new to it now with only 2 game's in "and on the second game we almost got it,so you will get better" But my question is how many time's will we go at it and lose and finally give up on it?
But Only time will tell on that issue,but so far I really Like it.The wife played 2 game's back to back,and that is really rare with any board game,so that shows you something!

One of the few cooperative "race against time" type games that never ceases to be fun.  I tried "Pandemic Legacy" but didn't enjoy all the extra fiddly bits and the destructible game pieces, so I came back to the original.  An hour spent saving the world from superbugs (or failing to do so) is never a waste, and the game design is brilliantly balanced, with most games remaining tense until the last moment.  I can't count how many times my friends and I have barely won within a turn of running out of cards - or lost because we were only one turn too late.

The quintessential co-op game. The game that started my collection and introduced me to the concept of a co-op board game. Simple yet complex, deep and rich with a compelling theme. The only real complaint is that the characters seem to fall flat, especially when playing with the same group repeatedly, and numerous play-throughs can all feel very "same-y".

Interesting mechanic for a game, but difficult to find the right group of players (without a strong alpha).  In my family, everyone has an opinion and everyone wants to approach the situation their way.  I don't get to game that much, but when I do, I want to be able to select a strategy without having to settle for an inferior one or having to fight to defend a better one (so I guess I fit right in).

It is also difficult to find just the right difficulty level - it seems that the game is either too easy to beat or impossible to beat (with On the Brink).  There aren't enough games in the middle where different play would have made the difference between winning and losing.  After the game ends, I never find myself saying, if I only moved to Rio...  

Rating for first few plays: 7.5, Rating for subsequent plays 6 (once the uniqueness of cooperative play and having the recently used infection cards return to the top of the deck wore off for me).  But, my family still enjoys it.

This game has rapidly become one of my favorites.  Quick and simple, but very tense.  Pandemic overcomes most of the problems that other cooperative games have (too much randomness, swingy challenge levels, etc) to produce a fun and elegant game experience.  Have never played it with anyone (from newbie gamers to hard core vets) who didn't enjoy it.  I have the first expansion and it adds a ton of replay to an already excellent game.

UPDATE: After a dozen or so more plays, continues to stand up and be interesting.  Excellent gateway game, excellent depth for the hardcore gamer.  I've bought the second expansion but haven't even played it yet, there's so much to do in the first one.  One of the best games in my collection.

Pandemic pits the players against four diseases (blue, red, black and yellow) spreading over the world. The goal is to find cures for all four before time runs out, the diseases become too widely spread or too many outbreaks occur.

Players need to collect and discard sets of five cards of each different color, one set for each disease. Given that there are twelve cards of each color, a hand limit of seven cards and limitations of trading cards accumulating those cards can be tricky. The cards can also be discarded for faster travel and to build research stations which further reduces the available cards. Players start with four cards each in hand and draw another two from the player deck at the end of their turn. If a player has to draw cards and the player deck is empty, players lose.

The diseases spread each turn by drawing from an infection deck, placing more disease cubes on the map. If the infection cubes of any disease runs out, players lose. Infections can also lead to outbreaks, when a city that is already at three infection cubes is hit. No cube is added to the city, but all cities connected to is are infected, which can lead to chain reactions. If eight total outbreaks occur, players lose.

Apart from the city cards, the player deck also contains event cards that provide benefits to the players and epidemics (5 for a standard game). If an epidemic is drawn, the infection rate is increased, leading to more infection cards being drawn each round. Then an infection card is pulled from the bottom of the deck and infected with the maximum of three infection cubes. Lastly the infection discard pile is shuffled and placed back on top of the infection deck. This means cities already infected will be drawn again.

If the players on the other hand manages to clear all infection cubes of a cured disease, that disease is eradicated and cannot infect again.

The players have to weigh multiple priorities over the course of the game. Treating infected is important, but so is trading city cards between players. Should a player hold on to a card or use it to build a research station or travel by plane to a city threatening to outbreak? What color to hold on to?

Despite being a fairly simple game, it has enormous replay value. At the time of writing I have 77 logged plays and I'm still not tired of it.

Make sure to try it as soon as possible!

RATING: 7.5
A game that so far has lived up to its hype for me. Fairly simple to learn, but with an elegant and well thought-out design that keeps you coming back for more. Love the balance of elements...eg, clean cities now to prevent a possible outbreak or move to another section of the world to hand over a necessary card to discover another cure? And, as discussed in another thread, the "intensification mechanic" is brilliant.  After an epidemic, to have to reshuffle the discards and place them on top of the deck, moments before having to draw multiple cards AGAIN, raises the stakes tremendously and creates a beautiful tension. Love this game!

Very enjoyable, simple game.  A quick, tense play from beginning to end.  As with any cooperative game, the game shines brightest when each player is involved and contributing.  Setup takes a while compared to game length, but this is shortened greatly if each player helps set up the board.  Rating may increase after more plays.

Very awesome game in my opinion. I love how simple the game is to pick up and the pacing seems just right. The game offers enough difficulty for beginners with the option to increase the difficulty once you've begun to win more often than lose, which for my group took at least 10 plays. Our record to date is about 3 wins to 12 losses. 

Check this game out for sure!

For some reason, I'm just really not that into coop games. I always have fun when I play Pandemic, I just never seem to really WANT to play it. It could be because my husband is a very bossy player. Which, of course he won't admit to, and gets upset when I accuse him.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Awesome cooperative game with a similar feel to the Lord of the Rings coop game, but a much more appealing & approachable theme. Also has clearer & simpler rules, but is more enjoyable & somehow more gripping than the LotR effort.

The varied roles & adjustable difficulty level are superb and should ensure this game remains challenging for a long time.

The components are decent, although the board is too small for the pawns/buildings, and doesn't quite want to lay flat.

WARNING: Appears to be common for copies from the first print-run to have missing/duplicate cards (my copy had 2 missing/duplicated - sorted with publisher).

Several games played with most of the games being close wins or losses. Upped the rating from 7 to 8 as it is socially enjoyable with 2. Probably the best introduction to the attitude shift involved in co-operative games, better than say Scotland Yard in that:- a)the short playing time allows a repeat to improve and consolidate performance; b)the problem of 1 player wanting to dominate the proceedings is tempered by what the held cards allow, which encourages everyone to socialize; c)more tense countdown elements and one use only cards to consider. One thing that comes to mind is that I complained about 2 chaotic subsystems in La Citta recently, and here they are again, but I can tolerate the card draws as amongst the team we can "discuss" a workable route through the chaos. Update: I was alittle concerned about replay value, but after a dozen plays it is still a fun, tense and quick experience, so up the rating.

Great short co-operative game, although with several solo plays I have more or less "solved" it. Theme and mechanics work wonderfully together. Too often the best move is obvious and it comes down to luck of the card draws. Would probably be more fun with more (have only played solo and 2p).

Rating is for the base game. The game improves immensely with the expansion.

Although you could find this game rather depressing, you shouldn’t give up just yet.  We must act NOW and we might have a chance to save humanity!
To eradicate this pandemic, we will have to stand together: we need to put in place a strategy to take advantage of our special abilities. Easier said than done… And the clock is ticking.
The game is quite balanced although having the doctor in your team is a significant advantage. The board, cards and pawns are nice.

Certes, au premier abord le contexte du jeu pourrait sembler déprimant... Mais l’heure n’est plus à dépression, il faut agir : êtes-vous capables de sauver l’humanité ? 
Pour venir à bout de cette pandémie à temps, les valeureux joueurs vont devoir faire preuve de solidarité. Mettre en place une stratégie qui tire profit des capacités spéciales de chacun n’est pas si évident, et l’heure tourne… 
Le jeu est assez équilibré mais compter le médecin parmi son équipe donne tout de même un net avantage. Le plateau de jeu, les cartes et les pions sont de bonne qualité.

[floatleft][ImageID=1029048][/floatleft]Pandemic is the king of cooperative games. Players must utilize their individual powers and work together as a team to stem the tide of the infections before a global outbreak grows out of hand. Despite falling to the pitfalls of being a cooperative game such as the 'leader' factor, Pandemic rises beyond that to be a great game. Pandemic also has one of the greatest expansions of all time, [thing=40849][/thing].

Played 3 times consecutively in one sitting. That's never happened with the guys I play with. After we lost the first game, we were eager to try again. After losing the 2nd game it became personal. The 3rd game, we were all less enthusiastic. It's a lot like Shadows Over Camelot with no choice as to which evil action you will choose. A little repetitive, but not bad. Might make a good gateway game.

A great coop game, relatively short play time, great theme, beautiful components. The pieces are oversized, but I like the huge pawns.

Probably the gold standard of co-ops. Appeals to a wide audience; simple enough to be a gateway but challenging enough to satisfy others. 

Unique player powers and scaleable difficulty. Game generates palpable tension as players puzzle out short and long term needs without running out of time. 

It will eventually get a little stale, due to limitations of the variable setup, but there are a couple really good expansions for distinctly different scenario type play.

A great cooperative game, although it falls apart with players of different skill levels, who end up ordering the less experienced players around.

I like that i can play Pandemic with new gamers, but the amount of autonomy and tactical input the game affords players who don't know the rules so well is so minimal, that it's hardly worth them playing at all.
In addition, playing with more experienced gamers really just involves deciding on a strategy, and then waiting to see if lady luck gives everyone aids or not.

In theory this should be true of most cooperative games, but play Battesltar Galactica or Arkham Horror, and you'll see that it doesn't have to be.

My favourite thing about Pandemic is deciding what to call each of the viruses and diseases..

This feels almost more like a cooperative puzzle than a game. A lot of the fun is figuring out how the game systems work and trying to delay the losing conditions just long enough to meet the win condition.
It's hard to play just once, especially if you lose, since every loss feels like "Oh, we just had to do two more actions and we would have won!"

The expansions add a lot to this game, and I love how modular they are. Pure co-op games are at risk of going stale as you figure out how to play the system effectively, but you can always add a different mix of the many expansion modules and you have a slightly new spin on the basic game to think about.

8 - I was really suprised by this game, I tried the Matt Leacock co-op trilogy at PAX and walked away with Pandeminc AND Forbidden Island.  Pandemic grabs me the best, it's a solid theme that's simultaneously serious and lighthearted.  Most games I play I find myself running short on time because of the player deck, with 4 players you end up with ~12 turns each time flies by quickly and all of a sudden you realize you won't get another turn after this one and the viruses overrun everything.  I find it a challenge and actually enjoy this with 2~3 people way more than 4~5 but still try to play it with new people whenever I can.  It's a nice gateway game because it breaks several molds at once; it is totally cooperative, it has a fixed turn count thanks to the player deck, it's fairly randomized without any dice, and it has a good amount of strategy "we don't need to worry about mexico since it just came up and we had an epidemic last turn, so lets focus on europe a little more."

6 3-player games. A lot of fun with a degree of tension in the cards that will give it replayability. However, to a large degree what you do is the same game-to-game, only the luck of the cards changes the board and the effectiveness of your actions. Still good for new players.

Tricky! Unusual in that it's a co-operative game. I guess it's like a puzzle you're working to help solve. You all win or lose together. (Usually lose - it's tricky) Don't play it with a mate who is a control-freak - let everyone have their say on what to do.

This game is probably the most well-known co-op game of all time. It has a good theme, simple gameplay, and short duration. I put off trying this game for the longest time since I didn't think curing diseases was super interesting, but it turns out this game is a huge cooperative puzzle that keeps fighting back every turn. It's a good design, but it might be slightly overrated.

Things you try to do always succeed, things that happen are simple and dictated by the deck. This game is a newer game that in many ways has been part of opening up hobby gaming to broader demographics. 

My biggest objection is that while everyone will be contributing to success, some will be doing flashier stuff than others, and that is often a frustrating element in a game.

Can you win the race for the cures before outbreaks catch up with you? 
Fills the cooperative niche with a simple focused design.

The epidemic mechanism makes the game since outbreaks will reoccur in the same areas. Must be able to fight a delaying action on treating (removing) the diseases, while also working on the cure - keep you eye on the prize - that is finding cures.

Makes it tough by using the cards for movement/building centers but also need them for the cure. The roles for the players provide a different experience when playing fomenting some discussion.

Finally my wife really enjoyed, she usually can't play just one session.

While not thematic looking - the game play is true to its theme.

RATING: 9
This game is widely praised for good reason. It's beautifully designed with respect to its themes. There are so many genius mechanics that ties well into the thematic elements, such as epidemics and outbreaks. The game is not too complicated and it fosters a good sense of teamwork without any secret agendas. If I were to point to problems, finding the right challenge is tricky with regards to number of players, number of epidemic cards and roles. Speaking of which, some roles are flat out better than others (the researcher for example makes the game far too easy). That being said, all the roles are well thought-out when it comes to approaching the narrative of trying to cure diseases and makes each player feel unique. The other slight issue is that luck can unfortunately be a bigger deciding factor than I would have hoped for some games depending on which cities get infected at a particular point. One note on the players' hands being open for all to see: while I like that players can really help each other out and formulate strategies together, it can make so that more experienced players (or who owns the game) tells others what to do on their turn. I don't think too much is lost by making hands closed, as players can still say what cards they have (such as how many of a certain colour) but there is an extra barrier in place so it is harder for players to dictate what others do on their turn. All that said, Pandemic is amazingly designed, very tense and its theme is so well executed that players really can get invested in trying to save the world.

An awesome cooperative game that actually requires teamwork.
More losses than wins up to now, but we enjoy the theme and the gameplay.
The bits could be better and more attractive.
And the rules can be a little bit confusing at first, but once all players get them, it goes fast and smooth.
My wife loves it and so does our older daughter, so we take it pretty often and it feels great working all together with the same goal in such a demanding mission.
Updated: form 8 to 9 after 25 plays (and finally slightly more wins than losses though only at Easy and Medium levels) because it is definitively a blast in our family.

After avoiding this for a long time because I was disappointed with Forbidden Island, I am quite pleased with this one. There are always a ton of things you want to do on your turn, and prioritizing them is a skill-intensive and tricky proposition.

RATING: 6.5
Purchased 3/1/2008 $33.10 - Rated after one play (2-player, introductory game).  The game was pretty easy to win as we had only one outbreak during the three epidemics that came up.  Red (SARS) was eradicated, Black (plague) was rampant in Europe, Bird Flu was taking over the US, and we almost eradicated AIDS in Africa and South America, but couldn't get the last cube off and it reemerged strong.  We had the Scientist and Medic, which seems to be a great pair for two players.  Will need to play with 6 epidemics soon (or weaker characters).  2 Bogata Player cards, 2 Scientists, no Dispatcher, so yes there are assembly problems.  Update: Have now played with 5 epidemics and twice with 6.  With the exception of a game that no one could win (just bad card sequencing, using up all black cubes in the second turn when the first epidemic card was turned), we have won all games and only one got close to using all the cards in the deck.  It plays much like a baseball simulation--you set it up and make the "right" decisions during play and watch it all unfold.

For those who say it's straightforward, I believe that's only true after a couple of plays.  There aren't many options, but remembering the details (must play card of city to build a research center; cured diseases get the Medic privelege; etc) isn't perfect.  Those rules should be on a cheat sheet card as well.  Personally, I'm not sure I like the "variable powers" mechanic.  I wouldn't mind if you could pick your character trait to use every turn.

Played this game a few times and I didn't really enjoy it.  Played with 3 and 4 and even 5 players (just toying around here).  Lost every time.  Always ran out of player's cards no matter what I did.  I guess if I play it long enough I will get "lucky" and win.  

And that's the problem for me.  Seems like a lot of luck no matter what you do. If the cards come up right for you, you can win sometimes.  Too frustrating of an experience 

Just felt bland, no theme for me.

I have yet to win a game (Unless you count the first one where we didn't play correctly! Oops!) but I love it! It gets so friggin' intense! I would probably give this game a 10 if the research facilities weren't so plain and ugly. Yes, the way those little tokens look weighs heavily on my opinion! 

Update: WE WON! I was nervous to sit down at the table at first, and almost didn't. There were two new people (me and some guy) and two people who had played before but never won. So why would I be nervous? Because they wanted to play on the highest infection rate, that's why! And we were pretty drunk by that time. OMG! It was crazy, intense, friggin hard as shit, but WE DID IT! Just barely... I can't wait to play again!

The de facto coop game now, and well deserved. This is still a really great game and very smart, but I just don't love it as much as I once did partially because Pandemic Legacy is simply so much more fun, and partially because Pandemic no longer offers our group interesting decisions as it is basically a solved game as well--the turn by turn choices are pretty easy after many plays.

I truly do not understand how people actually enjoy this game! First off its main game driving mechanism are two separate decks both of which need to be aligned in just the right way or you lose period. Yeah that's fun. When a games main mechanic can be so in favor of losing because a bad shuffle ruins the game it ceases being fun! I am not saying you should win every time or even half the time. I have played this crap game SEVERAL times and not won it once! Played it on my iPad, lost! Played it with my game group (who boasted they won 66% of the time) six times and lost every one! An utterly broken mechanic that only rewards good planning and problem solving a third of the time and even then its too easy for the game to beat you. For this experience its down to Forbidden Island for simpler card driven or Flashpoint Fire Rescue (dice are such a better randomizer than cards are) for me. I saw the redeeming value of Twilight Struggle and gave it a 4. I see NO redeeming value of this game whatsoever.

Remember this is just my opinion. All games are not for all people. This one just hit me absolutely the wrong way. I tried to like it, I really did because the theme is awesome. It's just a shame the game is so un-fun to me.

A tip for new players - watch out for countries with 3 disease cubes of any color. An epidemic striking that country can really up that outbreak indicator!

I can see why so many people like this game so much: the theme is very good and the cooperative element is intriguing. None the less, I am not really satisfied about it:
 
- the play is too abstract (every disease is the same) and repetitive

- among the different options available you obviously tend to stick always to the same, because every character has a very useful "special power", and it's almost always pointless to try something different. 

In the end, all the play is just to plan your winning moves for the next turn or two, and then cross your fingers about the cards you will draw.

Több játék után úgy érzem, hogy ez egy elég jó, együttműködést igénylő játék. Fontos, hogy közösen hozzunk döntéseket, és ne hagyjuk, hogy egy személy dirgiálja mit csináljunk.

Az első játékok sikerrel záródtak, de ennek a fő oka az volt, hogy nem tartottunk be, vagyis inkább elnéztünk néhány szabályt. Ezek ismeretében jelentősen nehezedett a játék és így nőtt a kihívás is.

A nehézséget még nagyban befolyásolja, hogy milyen szerepet húzunk, illetve kell valamennyi szerencse is a végső győzelemhez.

Bought the game at Leisure Games. The mechanics and flow of the game are well thought out.Unfortunately, I had to rate this down because after playing it with different groups, I must admit that this heavily relies on the right people. Pandemic is very cooperative and there are not many mechanic-related interactions available, so all the discussing, negotiation, planning etc. is voluntary and if people don't go for it, the game feels pointless. I had players sitting around not "getting" the game because they refused to interact with other players, which renders your own options useless. Still, with the right people, good game.

I feel like this game helped me get into board gaming. I bought it on Black Friday (Full price though LOL), and was fascinated by the Co-op aspect of it. Needless to say, I played it as soon as I could. It wasn't nearly as complicated as we thought it was, and won almost all our games. We DID find out that we were doing a rule incorrectly, which brought our win ratio down, but still won a lot of games. Recently, I won two back-to-back games on the hardest official difficulty. I guess we have to increase the infection counter next time. The first time we played was a blast, the second time was still pretty darn good. I just dislike how short the game feels with a decent amount of setup and space it takes. Also, the theme is lackluster, and doesn't impress a lot of people. The role cards are great, the components are nice, but overall I feel like this game just doesn't have enough for me. I can see why others praise this game so much though. It's a shame that the base game doesn't allow for more players; I don't think I will buy expansions for this anytime soon.

I would say this is not a game, but a puzzle.  One can EASILY play by oneself.  There can be some interesting decisions to be made, but not many.  

Also, there is not that much. . . realism in my humble opinion in this game.  There way the epidemics spread today are much more fluid it woudl seem to me.

Oh well.

Great game. We've only played it a half dozen times so far and each time we discover that we've missed an important rule (needing to play the infector even after drawing an epidemic; not needing to be in a research station of the same color in order to cure; etc). We're still playing with only four epidemic cards and still very much enjoying the tension.

Still have a few characters to try. Might bump this to a 9 if it holds up.

I don't care much for co-operative games, but this was much better than I expected. Last co-op game I remember playing is Lord of the Rings, which is so horribly convoluted and has a badly implemented theme. (At least it has excellent artwork).

Because of my experience with Lord of the Rings, I was expecting something as equally convoluted with Pandemic. Refreshingly, Pandemic is very easy and light. Very well implemented theme; all the roles and actions make thematic sense.

Because the game is so simple, you don't have that issue with Lord of the Rings during which experienced players will dictate what the newbies should do, and the newbies simply follow blindly. In Pandemic, it's simple for newbies to figure out what should be done without much help from experienced players,

I really liked this game initially but I have found that since it is a co-operative game one player will inevitably take control of the game suggesting everyone's moves. Also when you win the game it never really feels that satisfying.

Grueling management and damage control. Not really a (strategy) game. In co-op experienced, or just smart players dominate the entire proceedings. So best played solo, at which it can be considered a brain workout.

My most played game. 

I played in cafes with my friends and the cards were getting a bit sticky. I had to either eventually buy a new copy or get plastic sleeves- I got plastic sleeves. I no longer play in cafes, and so, I've taken the sleeves off. The cards has some more plays in them left.

//On the Brink - Best example of an expansion. More stuff and options to change how it can be fundamentally played without losing familiarity.

This game was somewhat dry for me but seemed to be liked by other friends.  Box art and game art are nice and although the theme is kind of offbeat, the game mirrors it's theme well.  Components are kind of skimpy, however.  Z-Man, get some plastic in your games!

Love it so far after 2 plays!  Makes me want to play again to beat it.  Played two 3 player games.  We lost pretty handily on our first play and set it back up right away.  The second play through we ended up with some powerful roles, the Quarantine Specialist and the Medic.  We eradicated red really quickly and then blue and cured yellow.  We just needed to cure black and we would win!  Then, we ran out of player cards...  That is one of the conditions for failure.  Was very frustrating after having done so well.  Can't wait to play again.

RATING: 9.5
I'm a bit of a fan of co-op games (not that there are many), and this is one of the best.  Played it about 20 times in 4 weeks, which is pretty much unprecedented for any game.  It has that real "just one more go" feel about it.

It would be a 10 for me, but I felt that I had to dock it half a point due to deck collation issues (sorted quickly by Z-mangames once spotted, but it's a widespread issue with it seems very few copies being shipped with two perfect decks of cards), and also the problem with the wooden bits.  They're very nice, but far too big (especially the player pawns and research stations), and I'd have preferred discs to cubes to mark the disease.

My rating has been revised twice since I first got the game, both times upwards.

I really enjoy this game, but I realized that I am not a fan of co-op games. Mainly because 1 player dictates the game while others just move the pieces for them. If there was a way to play this game individually I think it could be really fun, like trying to be the first player to cure a disease or each time you remove cubes you get some amount of points and most points win kind of game. I know there are other games out there, but it would be cool to play a co-op game where you try and achieve a common goal but all fight for individual glory.

The upside:
-Tense moments are provided if you manage to the late stages of the game.
-How deseases spread makes sense, provide a tough challenge, and strategic decisions arise when you start to predict what will happen where.
-Variable player powers to best use.

The downside:
-The perfect play can be destroyed by luck.
-Very prone to one more experienced player to control everyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An interesting co-op game that's at the right level of complexity to feel like a challenge, while still being accessible and enjoyable to those who are new to gaming.

It's like the first boss of a video game.  There are so many better games out there than Pandemic, but conquering it can open a newbie's eyes to what modern boardgames can truly offer, and give them the mental toolbox to go out and conquer bigger prey.

On its own, Pandemic isn't much of a game.  You struggle against a random card draw that evolves into a repetitive AI to cleanse the world of cubes.  
The randomness of the cards - and thus the AI - means that winning will oscillate between punishingly difficult and mindlessly easy, and the effort you put into the game doesn't necessarily translate into meaningful outcomes.

That Said, Pandemic does a good job instilling a sense of teamwork and camaraderie in the face of an implacable enemy, and it feels good when you see your unified struggle start to pay off if you make progress.

Original comment:
Fascinating mechanics and structure. I don't know yet if the "rigging" of the infections as to target the already-sick cities tips the game too much in the too-hard-to-win direction. But it's fun trying to win so far, and it's one of the only quick cooperative games out there, and could be used to introduce casual gamers into more strategic fare.

Years later:
IMO, Forbidden Desert upgraded this game in almost every way. It removes the finicky setup, removes the likelihood of a quick death by insta-Outbreaks amongst your first cities that got 3 cubes on them to start, and does everything Pandemic does but does it better, and cheaper.

Pandemic was a fantastic entry into the co-operative gaming genre, and simultaneously revolutionized and popularized it, but the years have passed it by (base game) as the designer's sequels surpassed the original in every way I care about.

The board is too small and the pieces too big, and you may sometimes lose before you get a chance to play.  These are the only major negative points.

Solid co-op. I enjoyed it a lot more at first, but the more co-ops I buy the less this theme holds up. The gameplay is extremely solid, but it feels like a machine. I can literally see and feel the mechanics as I play and I own better games that feel mechanical.

RATING: 8
A cooperative game with some small similarities to Shadows over Camelot, in that you have a role with special rules, you are restricted from speaking about your cards in hand in specific terms, and you are playing a cooperative effort against the game. Very approachable, and while not easy to accomplish, the strategy is easily grasped.

Pandemic is a great game. But after many plays I have kind of cooled on it. If I have an option to play a co-op game I would probably prefer Legendary or Flashpoint at this point. However, this game is definitely worthy to be in any gamer's collection. **Wife:8

I was the odd person out at a recent gaming convention - Pandemic had spread. I've never seen a game out there as often as this one. But it contained too may elements I dislike in a game: awkward mix of negotiation and problem solving (almost like a puzzle, but far more random - the deck luck factor is too high) with too much discussion & not enough play. I drifted off half way through the game. As with all co-operative games, I actually enjoyed seeing us lose. Not sure what that says about me...

The last game I played was the first that sparked my interest - I think the negotations were brisk, which helped. Rating could rise...

House Rules:

1. at the end of the turn, the players *may* take up to two player cards, they don’t have to. 
2. exchange of player cards does not require a player card of that city when both players are in the same city. 

Argument for those house rules:  The Player Cards represent "research", therefore it should be the players' choice whether they want to conduct further research or not.  I don't see why research data would get lost when two players meet to exchange data.

Clever game bought for our honeymoon (December 2009) but Hannah never really got into it. Almost all my plays (of which there were quite a few) were solitaire affairs. Although I always had fun I've found other solitaire games far more engaging (this one isn't intended for solitaire play, after all).

I love the theme and the components, but ... the only challenge in the game are the epidemic cards, and their location in the deck. Some roles felt overpowered for me.
Both Ghost stories and Yggdrasil are way better coops, as they don't have these instant lose scenarios (I'm looking at you double epidemic cards!!!), and both offer more interesting choices during gameplay.

Jugado a tres jugadores. El juego si nos transmitio esa sensacion de agobio en algunos puntos del mapa segun los brotes e infecciones aumentaban.
Jugamos tres partidas, cada una con una epidemia mas (aumento de dificultad), y la unica que conseguimos ganar fue la primera, aunque por la minima, ya que solo quedaban 4 cartas en el mazo de juego. Las otras 2 partidas las perdimos, una por fallo nuestro de organizacion y la otra, la mas dificil, por las epidemias y los brotes en cadena que generaron.
Se noto la diferencia de dificultad entre partidas, y nos gusto esa sensacion de derrota, pues nos incito a jugar mas. A gustado a todos.

I really like the simple mechanics of this game given the fact that you can teach very quickly and everyone could have a lot of fun.
Your group must have ways to inhibit alpha players to take control of the game because that will ruin the game, especially for newcomers.
If you like this game, I strongly recommend you to check out the Pandemic Legacy and see if you can get 4 players to play together through the "year" of the Legacy.

Cooperative game with the perfect balance between approachable, easy to learn gameplay and thoughtful, intentional strategy. Excellent for teaching and getting others into gaming. There are a few expansions that add different elements and mechanics in case the base game starts to feel dull. Most plays offer a good challenge with mounting tension as the game goes on, coming down to the wire whether you win or lose. Best with three players in my opinion but four is really fun as well. The variable player powers all add to an interesting experience and it is fun to try out different ones, finding which works best with the group as well as your playstyle. Art isn't amazing, but it is really good and components are good quality. All in all, a very well crafted game that never fails to be a fun time.

Losing to this game just makes you want to play it again and again. Its pretty quick.

The only negative I find is you all have to be working together or you are likely to lose. But working together usually means telling people how to play, which I don't like in coop games.

Great game.

RATING: 9
I resisted play Pandemic for a long time--probably because the theme doesn't exactly appeal to me.  I get nervous and clammy just thinking about those medical shows on TV.  One time I passed out in class when a teacher was telling an anecdote about a trip to the hospital.  However, there is too much strategic goodness to resist Pandemic.  I especially enjoy the different roles that each player can take because it means that different players have different mini goals even if the overall goal is the same.  

I can see that it would be possible to have one experienced player boss the other players around to the extent that the other players would just be pawns that might as well be painted pink, green or white, but that didn't happen in my game, and I would say that as long as all of the player were of similar skill levels, that this shouldn't be a problem.


***Update after playing with my boyfriend who likes almost none of the games I like***

I think I've finally found the holy grail game!  This is a game that has strategy, but doesn't leave us hating each other at the end.  Pandemic is a game that my boyfriend actually likes!  And I like it too.  A lot.  In the two or three player games that I'm likely to play at home, Pandemic is not going to suffer from dominate personality problems because we are all introverts and great at listening to each other!  Hooray!

My rating is raised from an 8 to a 9.

My first coop, and though I thought the execution of the game was good, I like games with competition.

RATING: 6
A fun and quirky game filled with delicious tension and frantic decisions.  A well-done cooperative game that truly feels like the game is effectively working against you.  At times, this game feels more like a distributed solitaire game than a game where everyone is making autonomous decisions.  A great game to experience the first time, but not a lot of replay substance if you're actually looking for something to play.  Success requires efficient management and coordination of actions, but over-optimizing analysis can quickly drain the fun from the game.

RATING: 5
After playing Pandemic, it is hard not to compare cooperative games like this one to puzzles (or card games like Solitaire). It is possibly too soon to disregard the full cooperative/solitaire boardgames genre outright based only on this game and the cumbersome Arkham Horror, but I must say that, for me, Pandemic already ranks lower than at least one other game in the genre: Ghost Stories. Most cooperative games should begin with stealing/borrowing the no-talk rule from King of Siam to try to make things more interesting.

RATING: 7
I expected more, but still it's not a bad game. It's a euro-style co-op game, where the theme actualy works well with the mechanics.
The players should be always on the edge, losing to the board is common and the rare victories are very narrow. 
The "intensify step" is an instant classic mechanic, it's thematic and makes the games very tense.
Not one of my favorites, but if somebody would like to play it, I'm ready to save the world.

I really enjoy this game, but fear that it often turns into one person basically taking control of the game, due to its cooperative nature.  As I'm often that one person, it's something I'm a little sensitive to, because I don't want me dictating what everyone should do to ruin the gaming experience of other people that are playing.  I don't think this has happened, but I see the potential that it could.

I like that this game constantly feels on edge, where you always feel like you are a step behind, and disaster could strike at any moment.  The theme is really beautifully implemented in the mechanics of the game.

UPDATE: I lowered from an 8 to a 7 primarily because most games I have played have turned in to one person dictating the game to everyone else, who mostly nods in agreement.  I know this is a common problems with cooperative games, but it seems to happen here even more than usual.  To me this really highlights the importance of mixing things up with a possible traitor/cylon, it keeps everyone on their toes and gets them involved more.

This was the second game I played in my return to gaming after Forbidden Island. Forbidden Island is a fine, fun game, but there wasn't enough there to be a true gateway game for me. Fortunately, there was at least enough of something there to make me want to play Pandemic. Pandemic proved to be MY true gateway game since it did provide the oomph I was looking for with strategy, mechanics, player interaction and excitement. In the gateway game war between Pandemic and Ticket to Ride, Pandemic easily wins the battle in my opinion. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Still one of the best cooperative games. It's simple to teach, and new players pick it up quickly, but the special powers and managed randomness of the epidemics keep it feeling fresh.

I love the way the tension builds to an exciting finish just about every time. It's a great gateway game, and regardless of prior gaming experience, almost everyone I've played with gets sucked into trying to solve the puzzle of the game.

Just wonderful. I also enjoy co-ops that are a bit heavier, but this one will remain a favorite for the foreseeable future.

8.75 This is a great game to play with my wife and 8 and 5 year old sons. We all have a good time when we play this one.

9/22/09 Raised this to a 9.  We really have a lot of fun with Pandemic.  We picked up the unofficial "Threat level six" expansion made by The Warp here on BGG and the official expansion "On the Brink".  Adding these in bring a lot of variability to the game, and I don't see my enthusiasm for playing it waning anytime soon.

One of the most finely tuned Coop board game I've ever played. The Epidemic mechanic is pure evil brilliance!

When I was reading the rules, alone, I still couldn't help but exclaim "ON TOP?!?!" when I read the epidemic mechanic.

I eventually got rid of it, it was just so, meh, kinda sick of seeing 90% of the game end because the player deck runs out. And after playing Pandemic Legacy, going back to this seems pointless.

Bought this for Thansgiving 2011.  The only co-op we had tried previously was Forbidden Island.  Pandemic is a better game.  Fobidden Island is fun for the kids....the 4 relics are awesome figurines.

I prefer Pandemic, my kids prefer Forbidden Island.

Diseases:
Yellow = ebola
Black = The Plague (or Zombies)
Blue = AIDS
Red = Bird Flu

got Flash Point : Fire rescue in July 2012 which is now my favorite co-op.  Great theme for the kids.....and a good challenge for the adults.

Not a favourite. Have felt like an observer in a couple of plays where the experienced player/s begin by explaining why your action isn't the best choice, then later just tell you your optimum move...and by the end just move your pieces for you.

Great co-op here - quick and interesting decisions to be made throughout.  I particularly like this game because it seems easy to teach and get a handle on, thereby lessening the "director" of the game effect that Lord of the Rings can sometimes have with less experienced players and one experienced hobbit.  The more I play it however, the less enamored I am with the game.  It's good and I'll play it when proposed, but it seems too easy to find the best moves - might be indicative of my less than normal win rate.  It could be that I've just lucked into easier set ups of the game.

It's a solid coop game, with challenge and simplicity.  It's easy to teach/learn and is a great gateway.

I've done an about-face on this game. The quarterbacking is simply unacceptable. It is a solo puzzle game that could support up to four people pretending to make their own decisions, but the reality is that the 'team' works together and there is no personal gain or loss to going against the grain. All in all, a good concept and a fairly good intro game for non-gamers, but I'd prefer other games like Carcassone for that role.

My wife's favorite game.  It's fairly simple and straightforward to play.  The difficulty is perfect for a players vs the game coop.  Winning is a real achievement and every game comes down to the wire leaving us on the edge of our seat the entire time. 

We get better results playing with 2, but upping it to 4 really increases the challenge for our groups.

The best co-op game out there in my opinion. Quick, streamlined and pretty easy to teach. You have to work hard enough at victories to make them mean something. Does suffer from an anticlimatic endgame, as most times you know if you've one or lost before it actually happens.

Very abstract, Theme is strange and not so catchy as Arkham Horror or Battlestar Galactica. Theme in Pandemic is dry. But its good way to test cooperative game mechanics to want buy next and better cooperative games as Arkham Horror:-)

RATING: 8
In my view the purest coop game with all it pros (we are a  team, hooray) and cons (alpha gamer problem). Even if there are now more complex coop games of the same type (no traitor; all information is public; enough time to discuss the actions) like Robinson Crusoe, you still get the same  experience out of this slim design. You have discussions what the best course of action is: Do you have to react to some imminent threat or is it better to improve your long term position. And all the time you fear to draw that one card, which will mess up your plans.

I like the mechanism that disaster always strikes, where you are most vulnerable (i.e. used city cards get put on top of city card deck, when epidimic card is drawn). I always  have a great time when playing this game.

A cooperative game in which players are trying to save the world from being overrun by disease. Players have to find cures for four different diseases. Finding the cures isn't hard, but it has to be done before the world is too sick to be saved. So players must choose between saving resources for the cure, or spending resources to move around the globe to treat affected areas before they get out of control. Random set-up and variable player roles ensure a different experience each time.

I enjoyed this game solo, which is how I intended to play the game from the start since I don't really enjoy co-op games.  This has interesting decisions and i like the reinfection aspect after the epidemic cards so the same areas continue to get hit.  This has the potential to rise in rating with more plays.  Maybe my favorite solo game.
EDIT:  this has risen. Play with five epidemic-won but was somewhat close.  This definitely a very good solo game.  This does get to be a little vanilla after some plays but adding "on the brink" ramps up the variety and makes this very good game system, great and very repayable.  I'm not one for co-op games at this point but I can see the appeal.

Got it today.  Played a couple of games against my son, one game with my wife, and a couple of solo games.  It'll take more plays to get a solid rating, but based on what I read before I got it and on how much fun it was today, I'm giving it an 8.5.  {Some people find the pawns too large, but that's no big deal to me.}

Aug '09: Terrific game that I'm shown to a lot of folks over the months.  My favorite solo game!  Moved from 8.5 to 8, but that's not a knock against it.

Had this game for about a year now and still finding it fresh and challenging.  The rules are simple and the game play fun.
I am a big fan of cooperative games and this one for me ticks all the boxes.  Not tried the expansion yet.

Changing my rating from a 9 to an 8 on 30.11.2011.
Still liking the game, but lacks the depth that having a week off on holiday and looking for something that's a real ball busting challenge would be.

Changing rating from 8 to 7 having now had the option of playing other games and getting a greater appreciation of game mechanics.

14.04.2012 Finally got to play this whilst on holiday with the expansion.  If you like the theme of the standard game, then get the expansion.

This game will kick your tail, and you will want to immediately play it again! The high level of difficulty in winning the game and a decent dose of luck work very well for the co-operative game.

I honestly have no idea why this game is so highly ranked. I actually don't think that there's anything much wrong with it, but I don't see anything good about it either. If you do want a relatively light co-operative game (I will admit that I'm not a big fan of co-ops in the first place - I play games to beat people, even if I rarely manage it :)), I think Forbidden Island, which is almost the same game with a different theme, both has better, more streamlined gameplay, and better components to boot.

But my wife loves this, and has played it hundreds of times with her best friend. What they see in the game is also a mystery to me...

Decent cooperative play game, but I prefer the longer and more immersive experience of Shadows Over Camelot.  Pandemic is good when you want a lighter and shorter coop game.

I've played Space Alert and the Lord of the Rings co-op by Knizia. I really dislike Space Alert, enjoyed the Lord of the Rings one. This one however, is the best of the three in my opinion. It has also been an incredible hit with ALL of my kids which is very difficult to do. I have 5, 7 and 12 and finding a game of sufficient depth to satisfy the eurogame bug in me but at the same time, include the younger kids is a monumental feat. I can add that my wife enjoys it also (a little). The co-operative portion makes for a more peaceful family gaming experience and of the co-ops I've played, I like this one the best.

(2/19/08) - Just got this today after buying it from GameOfTheDay.

(2/19/08) - [8] - Played my first game of this tonight. Two of us cured all four diseases and won the game. The Infection Draw mechanic is pure brilliance. Great co-op fun all around!

SOLD - (04/10/2017) - Pandemic has been donated to the local Goodwill. After the enjoyable adventure that was Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, I don't expect to see myself returning to the vanilla version anytime soon.

We played this at UCON 2012

I am sure people have complaints about Pandemic, such as quaterbacking and damage control (which honestly you get tired of both after playing a few co-op board games these days).

This is my take: Pandemic is a more interesting version of Forbidden Island with a Risk-like element to it :)

I love Forbidden Island, and so also loved Pandemic.

It was hard to tell before playing it if I would like it or not- some reviews made me wary and others made me curious.

I think now that none of those people had played Forbidden Island or else they would have been forced to mention it. Pandemic IS Forbidden Island, stolen, re-imagined (slightly) and re-themed, and made bigger and a bit more board-gamey and relevant.

That is, a global virus spreading is more topical and relevant to us than... a magical island... sinking... which we can stop how? And we care because? Yea, I think you get the point.

So. Just like Forbidden Island, damage control, flood management, hand-size management, character placement management, set collection and timed tracks.

Also, the really cool over-flow mechanic which can set off chain reactions (which ended the world in our game). I liked the flight-by-cards and control-center-building mechanics too.

There is even an option for one player to be a bad guy bio terrorist and a 5th virus expansion. 

I liked Pandemic. Oddly, enough. It is now at the top of my to-get co-op game list. Can't wait till we can afford to buy it, oi :P

RATING: 5.5
At first I was intrigued by the cooperative play and the struggle against the game. But then after a few more plays, I started to feel like it was too much of a puzzle game and if you failed it was because you made a dumb move. That made me kind of sour on the game, and most of the times since then that Cass has suggested it I've declined. We played it again recently a couple times and it still wasn't very satisfying to me.

A truly great fun cooperative game for 2-4. It is a good for new gamers to get a feel for gaming without feeling the pressure of competition. It also plays in 45 minutes.

Excellent game. Even on lower difficulties, I've rarely had a winning game where victory wasn't coming down to the wire. Seriously, games are always close when you win. When you lose - it's possible to lose horribly and you can only laugh when the game really screws you over! :)

My only quibble with this type of co-op game is that it is common to breed a table captain. Then it just becomes a single player game, with one player telling everyone else where to move. I try hard to avoid that, as the more experienced player I find it better just to advise others what their character can do ability wise and then let them lead the discussion on their own turn.

The board and components are of nice quality. Artwork is all excellent. Game mechanics and turn structure are simple to learn but can offer great depth.

All in all, games are generally a fun, exciting and engrossing experience. I really recommend Pandemic.

Creates an enjoyable sense of panic as outbreaks sweep across continents. Success in this game (of which I have had none so far) requires good card management and a healthy dose of luck.

A decent game, but I never really feel like there is much choice on what to do and everyone always confers about what's in their hand and what they should do, and consensus always seems to be that there is always one best course of action given any situation.

Not enough meaningful decisions for my own liking, and no real narrative or ambiance immersion to make up for it, but nonetheless non-gamer friends tend to love this game, so I end up getting my money's worth out of it.

While it may seems a bit dated, this game truly is special. A great mix of luck and strategy that offers a new and unique experience every single time you play. It is so easy to adjust the difficulty to create the best possible experience for any gaming group.

Elegant, clever, fun, but way more straightforward than it really should be (Card trading is almost never worth the effort so apart from that it is just set collection against the deck.). A good light co-op.

Relatively quickly gets to the point where you're losing because the deck made it unwinnable not because of your own failure. Still, a fun exercise to cool down after harder co-ops.

Played twice and lost.  I enjoyed both playings very much.  The model of disease outbreak is simple but very effective, and it's fun to travel around the world in the hopes of saving it.

Even so, I may pick up a copy, as some of my medical professional friends may enjoy it, and the short play time/simple rules will make it easier to suggest than something like "Lord of the Rings".

8.4.2009 I love co-op games. This one is a quick and fun co-op at it's best. Very accessible by all types of players. I like the way  its a team against the system. Rating after a few plays. Will revise when played more.

Played about 12 times now and my rating has not lowered. Although I do find that I don't want to play time after time, I do still find that I enjoy it each time. Finally beat it on hard level with two players. It was very satisfying.

OK, this has his a 10 for me. Every game has been enjoyable and its playability for me is fantastic.

Additional plays in 2012 and 2013. My 12 year old daughter loves this game and having a partner makes a huge difference. OK for solitaire (I give it a 7) but it's an 8+, almost a 9, when played with someone who "gets into" the theme! Love it! Stupid mistake of the 2012 Christmas shopping season - Amazon was apparently dumping old versions of On the Brink for well under $20 (free ship with Amazon Prime). I blinked and missed out on that deal. Now the old versions of On the Brink are selling for $50 on up!!!  Ugh!

Hugely enjoyable co-operative game.  Always a bit tense as you're never quite sure if you have the viruses under control due to a (not excessive) dose of luck.  The different roles (chosen randomly) make the game very different from play to play so you're forced to adapt strategies accordingly.

Fun cooperative game with some neat mechanics (such as the reinfections after epidemics).  After more plays, enjoying how the dynamic is a bit different each time with the mix of starting cities, starting roles, and how the infections come out.  Plays quickly and is easy to explain makes this a nice introduction game for folks, who are more than likely to request repeated plays.  Not a game for steady, repeated plays, but a nice one to toss on the table a few times a year.

Pandemic was the reason for getting a big boardgame fan. This game has simple rules, but it is not easy to win - and you can make it always harder and harder with special cards or more epidemic cards. And: people who arent so familiar with games and played pandemic were positive surprised and enjoyed playing. 

For me pandemic is one of the best games ever made. And it is definitly the best coop-game on the market. I like the artwork, i like the few roles, i like that every game ist different and a challenge.

At the moment, this game gets played the most in our gaming group and with my wife. The basic game works really well, but without the expansion, it could become a little boring after too many games. With the expansion, I can see many many more sessions coming.

Great, great co-op game. Hugely interactive! Non gamers will absolutely love! A hard game too win without complete cooperation from everyone on the team. Easy to teach/learn. Highly reccommend! Get the expansion for some substantial additional variety.

RATING: 6
I was highly anticipating this game, as many reviewers praise this game VERY highly. Yet it seemed very mundane to me. It really came down to trading cards with colours on them to other people, or running around destroying cubes. Cooperative games really lack the conflicting decisions that I really crave in most games, since it is a cooperative game, and you can easily split tasks between players.
Maybe I'm just not a cooperative gamer. I don't even see the appeal in playing it again really, there's no diversity to the game other than where the certain coloured cubes will appear next.

A very fun first experience, and our new favorite co-op game.  Very thematic -- and even better, very suspenseful.  An immersive feeling that we were actually trying to beat the spread of disease around the world.  Some very interesting mechanics, including the use of dealing from both the top and the bottom of the deck.

RATING: 7.5
Pandemic is just a great design for a simple co-op. It offers just enough theme to allow people who are so inclined to tell a story amongst themselves, and the cards-and-cubes hit a good balance between simple to learn for nongamers, and manipulation-friendly for gamers. It's true that Pandemic can get old and stale after awhile, but that's true for most games. This is one of those titles which is great to keep around for introducing new players or hosting mixed groups. And anything that can solo reasonably gets a half-point bump in my book.

This was probably my true gateway game, though I consider quite a few as fitting that in being my first mix of games introduced to over 2 or 3 gaming sessions before I consider myself to have gotten the bug. But this one for sure is probably the driving factor. It is extremely fun for me. I can't see myself turning down a game. And has worked as a gateway for me to introduce to L&S the forever partygamers. 

This was my first co-op, plus the theme just is right up my alley. Love this game.

I finally splurged and picked this one up from Fun Again Games because I wanted to play this with the expansion pack. This has been a regular game every couple weeks but my buddies didnt want to grab the expansion. My rating for this would be higher but to be fair I am rating based off the core game. The outbreaks are a great mechanic and original if I'm not mistaken???

31-10-2015. Rated after 1 play. So I finally played Pandemic. It's really, really close to something like Defenders of the Realm. I'm not sure what I like better, the lean design of Pandemic or the Fluff of DotR.

Regardless. Pandemic is a coop game set in a diseased planet Earth, where massive disease outbreaks need to be controlled by a team of medical doctors.

Each turn, each player has 4 action points to spend. By spending the points. These points you use to travel to locations, cure disease cubes, build CDC centers etcetera. At the end of your turn, you flip and resolve 2 cards that repopulate the board with disease. If there ever a 4th cube placed in a city of 1 disease, the disease has an outbreak and spreads to adjacent cities.

You win as soon as you develop a cure for the diseases in the game, and you discard a card by tossing 5 location cards while balancing the board for disease.

One of the most enjoyable games I own. It is also the game that makes me want to play it again more than any other. It's a co-op where all the players are working together to find the cure for the four diseases in the game. Now I didn't think I would like this game very much but I ended up loving it! It's lighter, plays quickly but is not that easy to win. I think I only won twice in the first six times I played it. Try it. You won't be able to play it just once.

There is a kind of satisfaction from playing this game that's hard to account for. The cooperative element is a team building exercise, and each game is a great puzzle to work out; however, there is a shallowness to the strategy that reduces the enjoyment for me. It feels repetitive with repeated plays. IMO, although this is a good game, it is over rated on BGG. Pandemic Iberia is a better implementation of this design.

First game I played, we lost in like 15 minutes. Not much fun there. Second game it came down to the last turn. If we didn't win on that turn we would've lost.

If you like challenging games without competition, this is perfect. Not why I play board games. I like strategy and competing against others. Won't ever turn down a chance to play it if it's being played, though. Maybe the expansion adds a bit more.

For the solo experience it feels almost too simple in terms of mechanics.  I'm not sure this will entertain me much in the long run.  I've only played it a few times and it already feels kinda old ...

UPDATE:  Tried it multi-player for the first time.  Discovered this is not to be played with a mix of very experienced players and new/low-experience players.  I played with an extremely experienced player and three relatively inexperienced players (I was on the inexperienced side).  The experienced player basically took over and told the rest of us what to do.  The rest of us were not given the opportunity to puzzle it out. Totally boring.

RATING: 8.5
Still THE gateway co-op game, although others improve on the alpha gamer problem if that's a potential issue in your group. 3 randomly selected characters, 6 epidemics, and On the Brink expansion with 5th disease and virulent strain is my preferred choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After about 6 or so plays, not so enthused about this one. There are some clever card mechanics, but I think the game plays itself out after a point and because it's co-op the decisions become easier or more obvious. This amplifies the deterministic feel.

I also think the inital player hands have a big effect on the ease/difficulty of the game and that spreads the consistency of the experience all over the map, so to speak.

----------

Pandemic is good for a co-op... but I don't like co-ops and would rarely suggest to play one.

I do feel that the game is very light; this is good for introducing to new gamers, but it's also a bummer for me because I don't want to make the decisions for the newbies and ruin their experience by dominating the play.  So, I only really have fun when playing with experienced players (I'd much rather use TtR or Catan as intro games because competition breeds excitement).  

I traded it off, but it's okay if I don't play it again.  It's fun, but 7 plays was enough for me to see that the game, while fun, doesn't have a lot of variety.

Gameplay can feel a bit mechanical, but the theme and tension are fun. I feel like we're getting our butts kicked most times we play it, but for the most part it has been enjoyable.

It can have some of the normal pitfalls associated with co-op games, but nonetheless I feel it is a good game and look forward to playing it more.

Pandemic has recently stormed into my current top 3 games. Perhaps because it is the first cooperative game I've played. Yes, you and your friends join forces to defeat the game - a truly unique experience for those who have only played competitive games.

Though the luck factor is fairly high (on the harder settings, you can easily have games that are un-winnable), you undoubtedly continue clinging to hope even when (almost) all is lost. The gradual build of impending doom makes for a thrilling experience.

More than any game I've ever played, advanced players can easily play with newbies and still have a great experience - making this a great into to euro games.

Amazingly, Pandemic is also the best 1 player board game I've ever played.

RATING: 8
Pretty good cooperative game.  I have played this game and both won and lost, so it's not too easy.  It becomes apparent what are the best professions to play with after a game or two.  With all cooperative games however, it's easy for one or two personalities to dominate the game and direct everyone's actions.  If you have any shy players, they may feel like they aren't playing.  Each game is different in that viruses will show up in random locations, but generally the games all have the same flavor since the board remains static and the route to victory is always the same.

Solo Player Value = Excellent. Playing solo with a single character is rough. I like to use two characters. A single player can manage two character easily.

Two Player Value = Excellent. Pandemic scales flawlessly.


Pandemic is a very well designed cooperative game that scales nicely from being played solo to being played with many. With a single player the game is absolutely fantastic. The single player can play as a single roll or as multiple rolls allowing for more choices.

Essentially Pandemic has been built as a solo solitaire game that has a strong win or lose victory condition with the player fighting against the game itself. More players can play the game because the game is solitaire based and the players are cooperatively fighting against the game. 

This multi-player solitaire against the game works well in Pandemic and actually changes the games difficulty. The game gets more difficult with more players as each player then gets fewer turn. In the solo game this is the player playing multiple rolls.

Playing against the game is accomplished by a player taking a turn for himself, followed by taking a turn as the game; after which it is the next players turn to follow the same pattern. The game's turn is fairly scripted and pre-set making it easy and clean to run the game.

Since Pandemic is designed to be played as the players versus the game the players can strategically work together for victory. This leads to some wonderfully tight strategic choices for the players that can truly make the difference in victory or defeat. Every choice feels like it is important.


Pros - 
- Great design
- Scales well
- Excellent strategic choices for the players
- Suits many players from solo to four

Cons - None

**This game is scored using the expansion


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the Pandemic expansion [thing=40849][/thing].

This is truly a wonderful expansion.  If only all expansions could be this good.

This is the first expansion that I can remember which offers multiple expansion components inside the single expansion.  Basically, in this expansion are three separate and individual expansions that can be added to the base game in any combination.  This is a great idea and goes a long way to improve the game longevity.

Due to that I will discuss each piece of this expansion separately.  

------------------

The Virulent Strain is the first piece of this expansion.

With this piece a single disease becomes more powerful and deadly.  That particular disease then has extra rules to govern it which are somewhat random and unpredictable.  This does a lot to increase the difficulty of the game.  

This new difficulty makes the players re-think the games strategy.  The players must now come up with a way to keep the Virulent Strain from quickly spinning of control, while maintaining control over the other three diseases.  This is often much harder than it sounds as the Virulent Strain is designed to cause the players problems.

------------------

The Mutation is the second piece of the expansion.

With this piece a fifth disease is added to the game, called the Mutant Strain.  The Mutant Strain has half as many cubes as regular diseases which make it twice as deadly.  This really cranks up the games difficulty.

The Mutant Strain is governed by special cards which are in both the player draw deck and the disease deck.  This makes the Mutant Strain spread quickly.  Dealing with the Mutant Strain often take precedence due to its lethality, but players must still contend with the other four diseases as well.

------------------

For a real challenge players might want to play with both the Virulent Strain and the Mutant Strain together.

Dealing with both of these disease at the same time is both fun and challenging and offers a huge step up in difficulty.

------------------

The third piece of this expansion is the Bio Terrorist.

This is the first game I can remember that takes a cooperative base game and turns it in a competitive game.  Many games now offer this ability with expansions and I think Pandemic was ahead of its time in this manner.

In this expansion one player becomes a Bio Terrorist and works against the other players.  The Bio Terrorist controls the Mutant Strain and decides how and where the Mutant Strain moves and grows.  The Bio Terrorist gets a turn like normal players but has actions geared toward spreading the Mutant Strain and damaging the players.

While this is a fantastic idea, I think this fails in practice.  The actions the Bio Terrorist can take are limited and weak and somewhat diminish the potency of the Mutant Strain.

Also, this expansion has an element of Scotland Yard to it.  The Bio Terrorist remains, and plays his turns, hidden.  Finding and capturing the Bio Terrorist greatly slows him down.  I don't think this adds anything fun to the game and even confuses the other mechanics.  

-----------------

I think two out of the three new pieces are absolutely fantastic.  The third piece I simply do not like.

Because this expansion so greatly changes the base game I think I should re-score the game.


Overall Playability = 8.3

Design = 9
Strategy = 9
Luck = 8
Artwork & Components = 6
Use of Mechanics = 9
Time of Play = 8
Fun = 9
Innovation = 9
Analysis Paralysis = 8
Theme = 8


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


[b]Unique Component[/b] - No unique components.


[b]Unique Mechanic[/b] - From what I can remember this is the first real fully cooperative game where the players compete only against the game itself.


[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - Fantastic game.  Easy to learn, but still offers deep strategy.  Scaling difficulty keeps the game replayable.

I definately enjoy  this game's version of coop play.  More so than in other coops I feel like this game can really go bad for you and its not through sub-optimal play.  Actions are always tight and you always wish you had just one more.  The different roles really maximize replayability and definately chang up the strategies.  Components are good if not great and are really added to by purchasing a petree dish for each cube color.  The game is definately easier with less players.  I've lost severl 4 player games (w/ 5 Epidemics) but the balance still felt right and the tension was always there.  If you drop down to 3 players I think you need a 6th epidemic to make it more tense.

Pandemic: If you're looking for a cooperative game, this is probably this best game that you can show to anyone. Frankly, I like Forbidden Desert more, but I'm part of the minority for that.

The pros: Solid cooperative game with an original theme, straightforward rules and surprisingly short playing time (even shorter, when you lose). Should appeal to casual gamers, too. The virus spreading mechanism is outstanding.

The cons: Can be easily dominated by an experienced player. Depends mostly on lucky card draw. Some of the roles are less useful than others.


Update: the new german version by Pegasus is slightly better in terms of components. BUT the translation of the rules is mistakable in some places, and the text on one of the special cards is simply wrong. Sigh... you can't have everything, can you?

I understand why this is as popular as it is. The game provides so many moments where you need to sit down and puzzle things out. The games always seem to come down to the last turn or two and pressure really rises as you have to take increasingly risky moves to get done what needs to get done. Nice, clean design, but co-ops are hard for me to get to the table.

A kooperatívok koronázott (?) királya! Nekem  a téma és a játékmenet összekapcsolása az, ami igazán egyedivé teszi. Mindig csodálom a tervezőket, hogy honnan tudnak ilyen ötleteket találni, hát még, hogy mennyi tesztet hajtanak ahhoz végre, hogy ennyire kiegyensúlyozott játékot tudjanak letenni az asztalra.
Pontosan annyira nehéz, amennyire folyamatosan fent tudja tartani az érdeklődést. (Akinek ez nem volna elég meggyőző, az tetszés szerint "beállíthatja" a játék nehézségét - a kezdőtől a legendás szintig).
Külön plusz pont azért (bármennyire is eretnekség ilyet írni egy TÁRSASjáték kapcsán), hogy szóló verzióban is játszható ;) 
Minden jósága ellenére (vagy inkább pontosan amiatt) a Flash Point - Fire Rescue az amit ezek után előszeretettel kipróbálnék :)

Loved it at first, fun diminishes over repeated plays. There is almost always a "BEST" move to make, and yet still not necessarily a possible way to win. Therefore the game can feel rigid, yet still possible to lose. Like a VERY complex group version of solitaire (Not in that you don't interact, but that you mostly know what your moves should be and yet the cards can be dealt in such a way that a win is impossible).

RATING: 6.5
Initially, I loved Pandemic. It was a simple, elegant design, that could be played by any and all with a theme that didn't turn off anyone. The fact that the game also played quickly gave it a chance to hit the table quicker - something to do in between events instead of waiting specifically for a "Game Night".

That said, each game leaves me slightly wanting more. I'm not begging for a traitor (I'm in the minority of actually not caring much for that mechanic); but it feels so rote - so demanding that the role you choose must be played in a particular fashion or everyone suffers.

Occassionally, I can still rise to the challenge. I want to be the (insert role here) and see if I can take on six epidemics; but with so many other games out there...as much fun as others have putting this on the table, I'd like to play something new.

Until something like Swine Flu twists me up...then it's a Pandemic Weekend Jamboree!

I'm generally not a fan of co-op games (I very much dislike Shadows over Camelot for example) but this one is great. The game plays fast and is always tight. Also the co-operation feels like co-operation rather than someone just dictating what everyone else should do. The game evolves very quickly which is always a plus.

Given my dislike of co-ops, I was surprised how well I liked how the various mechanics hung together in this one. The way the system ramps up the spread of infection makes it quite tense.  However, there is a danger that one player will take control; fundamentally, it's just a solitaire game pretending to be a multi-player (in the way that Axis and Allies was a two-player masquarading as a multi-player).

RATING: 4
Solitaire multiplayer. Too easy for one or two veteran players to make the decisions for the other players in the game. At least with, say, Arkham Horror, a player gets to draw an Encounter card and play it out. Thematically, I find it annoying that the cards function like one part disease research solution and other part like... airline tickets. I *do* like how the gameplay changes depending on which roles are *not* in play. If you like solitaire games, this one's for you. I'd probably play this game when I'm in a mood to watch a game unfold, rather than meaningfully play it.

****

What I liked about Pandemic is that all five roles are critical to solving winning the game. And you only have four of them!

But that's about all I liked. Pandemic also reminds me of AH -- except that there's none of the Encounter card chrome (aka. "randomness") that puts a player in that amusing position of making a possibly human "sacrifice" for the team.

Arkham Horror:
"Hey, Beaver! Go into that Witch's House and get the Clue token!"
"No, way Whitey! There's a Gug there, and all I have is this crappy Dagger! I might get Injured, and Mom would be upset!"
"Oh, alright, Beaver. We'll meet in the street and I'll give you my Curse of Azathoth. But you'll have to give me $2 for it, because I'm low on Sanity and need to go to the Sanitarium."
"I told you, you shouldn't have read the Livre De Lion."
"Shut up Beaver, and sneak past that Gug!"

Pandemic:
"Okay, Beaver will remove two cubes in Mexico City, Dad will build a research center, and Mom will dispatch me to Beijing."
"Hey, Wally. You should let Beaver make a decision."
"No way, Dad! Last time he did that, there was an outbreak in Tehran!"

A good cooperative game to play when you don't have the numbers for something like Arkham Horror or Shadows Over Camelot.  The theme fits well within the parameters of the game, too.  You can't help having a "I Am Legend" feeling (without all the cool combat).  Recently changed my rating from 6.5 to 8 because of the expansions.  Theme REALLY shines now!

A pure co-op, which is interesting, but it feels too "puzzley" to me, like if I want to be playing well I would have to be looking many turns ahead, which is a painful and analysis-paralysis-type thing to be doing in this game.

RATING: 9
Pandemic has just the right amount of rules to invoke the theme, but not too much to get bogged down. That's why it isn't that hard to teach to non- or light gamers (who are amazed at the existence of a game where you don't try to defeat the other players, but the game itself).

The down-time is almost non-existent due to the players being so involved in solving the puzzle (which eradicating the viruses to some degree is). There's a risk of a bossy player pointing the others to what they should do, but in a grown-up group, this shouldn't be too much of a problem.

The first time I played this game I thought is was the best co-op game ever. Now that I've played it half a dozen times with different groups of people, I realize that the game is really meant to be played solitaire. If you've got a group of mixed experience the vets will end up "advising" the newbies on the optimal move. The result is the newbies might as well not be playing at all. There has to be better rules on interplayer communication than exist to make this game work multiplayer.
And who wants to play alone anyway.

I like the theme of Pandemic, I like that it's cooperative. I think that the mechanics are good. I just honestly don't find it very fun. By the way, don't believe what it says about 30-90 minutes. You're at 90 minutes at least, assuming that you're actually taking the time to talk to your group about what you plan to do. Most of my games have run around 2 hours and 10 minutes. The game is a lot of fun the first time you play it, but after that it just becomes sort of boring, especially if you're playing with the same people. Not a consistently fun game, although mechanics-wise, it is great. It is just too long and too lacking in replayability really be a great game.

The tendency for a co-op to devolve into one person bossing the others around can really rear its ugly head in this one, but if the bossier players can resist the urge, this is a great thematic game that is highly accessible, addictive, and terrific as a solo game. This is a great game to play with non-gamers.

A very tense, straightforward yet maddeningly difficult cooperative game that always seems to come down to the wire (through a number of possible means of defeat). Fun factor is very reliant on the personalities of the players (some people tend to "take over"), but with a cooperative group, this game is a wonderful experience. Trading cards seems to become an overwhelming necessity at harder difficulties, which makes for more of a dry, "puzzley" experience and can lead to annoying downtime as elaborate trades are plotted out.

Rating could be higher except for the fact that it suffers from what most co-operative games suffer from...the experienced players tend to take over games.  All players should have similar playing experience with the games or the experienced players need to be mindful of taking over the game.  Other than that it is a wonderful game and the feeling that little cubes (diseases) are taking over the world is great.

There's a lot of love for Pandemic out there and it is definitely a well developed game.  that said, I generally prefer my coops to be a little more thematic so I have something interesting to talk about while working out the puzzle with my friends (e.g. Robinson Crusoe, Kingdom Death, etc.).

I'm probably in the minority that would rather just play Forbidden Island for a light coop (with alternate tile layouts for extra challenge if needed).

What more can I say about this classic? Love the intensification mechanism, and love the perfectly tuned balance between treating cubes and curing diseases (depending on difficulty level). I play the app solo a LOT.

I guess I can give my view on some of the complaints. Personally I don't have any quarterbacking issues as I think it's just as much a group problem, and my group ain't so bad. The people who claim it's "solved" and that there's always an obvious optimal move haven't played the harder difficulties -- at that level there's so much going on and a couple of wrong moves will finish you off. You can certainly get screwed by bad luck (say an epidemic hits a city with an outbreak cube) but one could also argue that you should have been more careful with outbreaks.

Amazing game that deserves its spot among the greats.

Visual Appeal: (4)
The board and pieces look really nice and streamlined. I have the older version, and from what I have seen, the newer one looks a tad better. One pet peeve is that the map has cities in some odd places. I suppose it is just to fit the words and other graphics comfortably, so I can get over it.
 
Components: (5)
I am playing every game with the first expansion now, and it really enhances some of the components. I love the petri dishes and the smaller pawns are a sensible touch. Cards all feel nice and they aren't wearing too quickly. I like the tracks on the board because they're easy to read and access for all players.

Theme: (5)
Best part of the game is theme. Unlike other games whose theme could be considered nerdy or boring, this one stands out as a player magnet. I can also dig the more-equal-than-usual gender representation in the game. Welcome to the modern age, boardgames, where women do sciencey things too; they don't just pose in futile chain-mail bikinis! Getting back to the topic at hand, the game does a great job making you feel like you are cooperating to save the world from certain doom. Even the likelihood of failure is well simulated. In case you haven't played the game, that is a very HIGH likelihood on harder settings.

Learning: (4)
This is on the list of many people's gateway games. I believe it is rightly on that list because it is easy to learn and fairly low pressure. I mean, the game is hard, but you don't have to worry about experienced players laying the smackdown on you. In fact they will be helping you. Which means, only a short intro is needed before you can jump right in and learn through experiencing the game. Difficulty settings are really well balanced for the casual and hardcore players alike. 

Gameplay: (4)
I only say 4 due to the ever present Alpha Gamer problem in co-op games. Really if you feel the need to control everyone's actions, you shouldn't be playing this type of game, but it happens. Sharing cards is a challenge and provides players with good points of discussion on how to use their actions the most efficiently.

Overall Fun: (5)
This game has been a huge hit with even my non-gamer or casual gamer friends. It is low pressure enough that everyone feels comfortable jumping in. I always enjoy teaching it and watching the horror on new players' faces as the realize how tough some decisions actually can be and what sacrifices need to be made to save the world! This is my go-to Co-operative game without a doubt.

RATING: 7
First playthrough was enjoyable experience with my wife and I having a two player game.  Ranked the game an 8.

Played again and it seemed I was running the entire game and people were asking my opinion on what move to make.  I felt like I was playing solo with other's moving the peices.  Even when trying to get them involved in decision making it still felt like a solo game.

8 > 6.   I really don't ever want to play again.

Playing with people who want to play for the enjoyment of the game makes this much more fun.  Played a 4 player game and not once did anyone ask for advice, they just played their game.  Made it much more enjoyable, but I bumped up the rate by one.

Flash Point: Fire Rescue has replaced this game for my Co-Op joy.

RATING: 2
Looks more fun for schools, fostering teamwork, rather than regular recreational game play, which could get a little tedious and colorless after a few victories. In my case, after one victory. 

It's really not a multiplayer in that there is no hidden knowledge and no hidden agendas. The fact that you can say what's on your cards, but can't show them is a truly feeble, even disingenuous, attempt to make it seem otherwise.

And I don't think this even simulates how epidemics spread in this age of massive intercontinental travel.

Forbidden Island is more charming, fun, brief. Otherwise, I avoid co-ops and solitaire-designed games, RPG games excepted, of course!

Am Anfang war ich sehr begeistert von Pandemie, aber bei wiederholtem Spielen stellte sich dann doch etwas Langeweile ein. Das Prinzip bleibt halt immer dasselbe und auch zufälliges Kartenziehen kann nicht über die Monotonie im Spielablauf hinwegtäuschen. Als Coop-Spiel ist es sicherlich nicht schlecht und das erfrischende Thema sorgt dafür, dass Pandemie mit fast jeder Gruppe funktioniert, aber meine Begeisterung ist merklich abgekühlt. Vielleicht bringt die Erweiterung mit ihren neuen Rollenkarten und den neuen Spielmodi wieder etwas mehr Abwechslung rein.

Great fun with 2 players, may be more difficult to get the right balance of personalities with more, as the 'co-operation' usually boils down to agreeing with the person who's right - it seems extremely difficult to win unless almost every aspect of the player's actions are coordinated.

sold, because at the time I thought I would never get my boyfriend to play this (much too complicated and unfun theme). In the meantime, he's big into boardgaming, and we've played other people's copy. It's ok, but I don't regret selling it. I prefer Forbidden Island because it has nicer bits and a friendlier theme.

Love this game! I thoroughly enjoy the cooperative play and how different and challenging it is each time. The game mechanics work very well and help to create/mimic real-life tension as the diseases spread across the board. It works great as a two player game.

We own the 1st edition of the game and have inadvertently created our own house rules: you must find a cure at the research station in a city matching that disease colour, and when you run out of research stations, you can't place any more.

RATING: 9
Based on several solo plays (for which it is very suited), I just love this game! I want to play it again and again and again. So far I'm pretty on top of it, when it comes to 4 epidemics, the game where I used 5 I lost badly. I cannot imagine how to stop 6 epidemics (yet)!
There is a real sense of urgency and immediacy in your decision. All the player characters are challenging to play (I'm always happy, when I have the doc in my team though).

RATING: N/A
The weird rules about the (sort of) hidden cards are hard to execute. So I can't show you my cards, but I can tell you what they are. You forgot? Ok, I'll tell you again. Weird. At the same time, playing with visible cards leads to the most experienced player soaking it all in and telling everyone else what to do. I think I'd rather be "in it together" to save the world with the possibility of all losing together, while also tallying up my own set of personal glory points to be compared with others for placement at the end of the game. This was my first cooperative game experience. I have since determined that I simply do not like cooperative games, so I've removed my rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
updated 7.5 => 8.0 after buying expansion (On the Brink) because of much higher replay value and difficulty level. Unfortunately like all co-op games you have to be careful not to create an alpha-leader problem when you're getting good.

RATING: 6
Considered to be a very good co-op board game, I find this to be a bit like Solitaire where it's really the game letting you win by the distribution of infected cities at the startand the game not giving you a lot of epidemic cards in a row. There is a difficulty setting that can be adjusted (altered by inserting more or less Epidemic cards), but it seems a little futile sometimes. What I don't really like in the mechanics of the game, I do like in the theme of the game. It simulates spread of disease well and realistically and sometimes you just can't control the random events of what happens. Everyone gets their own special role and can contribute in their own way. It forces communication, but doesn't rid the problem of the overbearing co-op teammate. Overally, I like Pandemic, but not a game to play regularly. It is a good game to start other players on. Best played with 4 or 5

RATING: 4
A great game for gamers who like to table talk, because here you can plan and plot together against the plagues all you want. This game brings non-confrontational gaming to a whole new level. Missing the outright winner of Lord of the Rings, or the secret traitor of Shadows over Camelot, the game is all about beating the cards. Good co-operation, deduction, guesswork and (card seeding) luck will carry you along to ultimate victory or failure - everyone either wins or loses together.

Meanwhile... back at the ranch... well... I guess it'd appeal to gamers who like the social interaction and banter that goes together with a game like this. I feel it's more like some sort of corporate training course where the course instructor will give us a summary at the end of his/her observations of the behavioural traits of the participants - the aggressive, the passive-aggressive, the follower and all the other personalities a game like this can bring out.

My wife complained that it's not actually a game and could I please pack it away so as to make room on the table for a real game. I think that's a tad harsh - there's some fun to be had here - it's not always obvious what the best choice is, but it feels like it doesn't really matter if you're there or not - the whole thing can be played solo and it'd be much easier to agree on what to do in your turn(s). Ultimately, in the words of a wise friend - "I don't mind it." That said, couldn't we play a game instead?

I might be inclined to bump the rating up a notch when playing with the terrorist variant - a little human interaction to mess with the best laid plans goes a long way to making fun.

Easy, fun but not so deep.  A game based in an analogy of the drop that spills the water.  It is like [i]Outbreak![/i], the movie.

RATING: 8
Pandemic is one of the cornerstones of modern gaming.  The first co-op game I remember playing was Forbidden Island, and I was blown away by that.  Wanting to try something else like it, I heard Pandemic was pretty good.  You know what?  It really is!  The tension that builds as the viruses spread throughout the board, and knowing that another epidemic could strike at any time.  With players trying to coordinate between trying to eradicate a disease or fly to Paris to stop the blue disease, or build a research station in Hong Kong, or clear some yellow cubes in Lima... the choices and decisions to make get tough quick!  Though I would recommend Pandemic Legacy over this, standard Pandemic really is one of the most solid co-op games ever made.  It deserves its place as an all time favorite among gamers.

Great introduction to Co-ops. Difficulty is scalable which improves ability to play over and over again. Game can annoying depending on personalities so if there is an alpha in the group you may want to set some ground rules about how decisions are made. Likewise if there is a person who doesn't think strategically you may find yourself holding their hand the hold time. Story line is fun and gameplay is simple despite the initial complexity of setup and rules.

Pandemic is a true masterpiece of board gaming.

Decent cooperative game where players wrestle between healing the sick and finding a cure as the world succumbs to a dangerous contagion. Haven't played in a while because I've forgotten the rules and don't want to learn them again. :) As in many co-ops, one alpha player may try to take charge and tell everyone what to do. To a certain extent that can help a co-op game, but when that happens it drowns the fun-factor, so I try to deflate alpha players whenever I see that. For a lighter/faster co-op, see Forbidden Island.

Such a great game. Fighting back the diseases keeps everyone in my game group on the edge of their seats.

RATING: 9
This is a fantastic co-op game, with well balanced roles for each person to take, and a good mechanism for adjusting difficulty. I like how the game really balances out between playing with 2 to playing with 4 people, as the number of special abilities and chance to cover the whole board increase, but the means for getting 5 cards of a color in one person's hand get more difficult. The game mostly has very good components, but sometimes I do feel myself wanting a little bit more theme as I go around chasing little cubes off the board.

Still, this game is always a great time, and almost every time I play it, the game ends with a nailbiter finish as we rush to cure the 4th disease while all the other elements of the game threaten to defeat us. That is exactly how any co-op game should play out in the endgame.

Having come back to Pandemic due to Pandemic Legacy, I can appreciate the design better now. When I initially tried it, the play dynamics kept me from enjoying the game very much. The biggest problem with Pandemic is that once you know you will win or can't win, all of the tension goes away. Pandemic Legacy fixed this issue by adding long term consequences, so even if you lose, you're still invested in damage control.

This can be a very enjoyable game. It scales well from 1-5, though you need to increase the difficulty for fewer players. It's easy to learn, easy to teach, and doesn't take long to play. It's an excellent game to play with non-gamers. When you are in the middle of the game and things are getting out of control, it can be a wonderfully intense and immersive game to play. Unfortunately, those aspects peter out as you approach the end since you can usually see whether or not you will be able to win 3-5 turns too soon. At that point, you're just going through the motions to bring the game to it's inevitable conclusion. Win or lose, it's very anti-climactic. The only truly exciting ending is getting too many outbreaks, as that is an ending whose certainty cannot be calculated beforehand.  As a house-rule, I think it would be more enjoyable to remove the losing conditions for running out of cubes (the more cubes you have, the more likely you are to get outbreaks) and for exhausting the player deck (just reset the deck, re-seeded with Epidemic cards, and continue playing). I'm not sure how to make winning more enjoyable... maybe if the person who goes to the research station and plays the cards to cure a disease, and only that person, had to take an action to roll a die (I know, I know...) and get a 5 or 6 to succeed in producing the cure. Yeah, it adds luck to the game, but at least the ending would be exciting.... Honestly, if the anti-climatic end game could be remedied, this game would easily be a 10. As it is, I'm not sure how long it will hold out at a 9 rating.... 

Oh, and while the game does look good, the board tends to warp and the player pawns, research stations, and disease cubes are all far too large.

A great gateway coop game that I have enjoyed every time I have played it.  Very simple to teach, but enough challenge and options per turn that keeps it interesting for more veteran players.

I own the expansions but I'm waiting for the base game to feel stale until I use them.

Co-op can be pretty hit and miss for me.  This is definitely a hit.  Very tight.  Quick, tense and fun.

Always soooo cloooose.  This game has the most remarkable ability of any game I've ever met to turn everything upside-down where you are absolutely convinced that you've won and there's absolutely no way you could lose from here... then an epidemic arrives and the infection comes and it's exactly the wrong cities that get infected and within about 1 turn you get absolutely smashed!  No game has the ability to turn your overconfidence into your weakness like this - it really is amazing and fantastic to watch.

And so devastating when you think you're gonna win next turn... only to have all your hopes dashed.  It's frikkin great and really keeps you on your toes.

RATING: 7.5
11/07/08: Tried a 5p game with 4 Epidemics. We won, pretty easily in fact. Also played 3p Heroic, and finished the game with all 4 diseases eradicated and not a single outbreak!

3/20/08: Played 2 games with 3 players on Heroic tonight, and it had a similar feel to 4 player Normal. I think I like it better with 3 players though, less waiting and fewer people to cause bickering.

3/17/08: Played 2 more 4p/Normal games, lost both soon before curing the 4th disease. Outbreak city!

3/15/08: We played x2 with 4 players on Heroic, and we got owned! Then we played 4 players on Normal and lost 1 turn from victory twice. Finally we played 3 player on Normal and won easily. I'm concerned about the percentage of games that are probably unwinnable from the outset, which I suspect is high with 4 players (especially on Heroic)

3/14/08: I've played about 4 times and have yet to really lose. This game seems kinda easy... maybe I'm just getting lucky. It seems like the game is either winnable or not from the outset, of course you don't know that. It could be the case that the game setup is simply unwinnable. I've not really lost yet, so I don't know how true that is.Pandemic is a very slick attempt at a cooperative game. The main problem with it isn't a problem with the game perse, it's a problem with the Genre. Some people complain that games like Race for the Galaxy are Multiplayer Solitaire... this game isn't Mulitplayer Solitaire, it's just Solitaire!All the cooperative games I can think of suffer from this same problem. One domineering, loud, or stubborn player basically plays everyone's hand. In fact, in order to maximize the chances of winning this is really the optimal strategy. Ideally, everyone collaborates to determine the best course for everyone, but that one loud guy can ruin the fun for the other players by saying "you do this, you do this, and you do this!" The best (or at least a sufficient) coarse of action can be easily constructed by any one person, there's no real need for collaborative input.

An Amazingly difficult and challenging experience (only play with 6 Epidemics), but probably THE best Co-op game I have ever played. So many games come down to the last round, only to end with the extinction of the human race.

I kind of expected my euphoria over this game to dissipate by now, but if anything it's gotten stronger.  On a purely game-mechanic basis, this is certainly not the best game out there, but something about it really jives with my brain.  It's almost completely monopolized my boardgame-play time since I got it.  I haven't even played Agricola once since then, though "objectively" I'd say that Agricola is the better game of the two.  Anyway, it's enough to bump this to a 10, for now at least.  We'll see how I feel in a year or so.

Love the game, but it really depends on who you play with. Since this is a cooperative game, control freaks who essentially try to play solitaire and boss you around, and on the other side of the coin, players who don't put much effort in and refuse to discuss moves, can ruin your game completely. With people you know well and at your skill level though, the game's really fun! A game between experts creates discussions that really make you feel like a brainy doctor as you calculate possibilities to do the most good with those preciously few 4 actions each turn. I love the mechanism of spending 4 action points per turn, the theme is popular, original, intense and immersive, and the rulebook is amazing. Wish it had cool figurines like those in Fury of Dracula, Shadows Over Camelot, Tannhauser etc, or even have the pawns labeled 'M', 'S' etc because I often have trouble distinguishing them from each other when I glance at the board, since the colors of each role are arbitrary. 

What I really love about this game is that if time is tight and 2-4 of us want a game, Pandemic will definitely finish within 45-60 minutes, even if there are new players. What I'm leery about is that there is a definite shelf-life to the game before things get much less intense and interesting (after you internalize all of the mechanisms and strategy), and I currently estimate this at 10 plays. But those first few plays are a BLAST.

My rating of this would be higher but I'm not a big fan of a "group-think" type of co-op.  These type of games just don't do it for me like they should.  I like it better as a two player game than as a 4 player game.  With two people, I'd give it an 8.  I think the dynamic of two people working at it is a little more tolerable than when you have 4 people trying to coordinate movements.  Hence, the 7.5 rating.  One of the bigger things going for it is that it easy to learn and plays quickly - a definite gateway game.

RATING: 9
Cooperative, still fresh after 10+ plays.  Everyone likes this which makes it easy to pull down as possibility for evening game.  I must restrain myself slightly from taking over game. Nearly all games recently, win or lose, have been on last move and 1 action extra or 1 not enough.  Play with at least 5 epidemics, otherwise way too easy, even in learning.  Best case is to get killed (ie lose) first couple of games to build challenge i think.   Because then when you beat it, it feels even better.

Still a firm favourite after probably 30-40 plays (before I started recording plays).  The challenge is different each time depending on how many players are playing and what roles we pick up.

The thing I most like about Pandemic is that you need to be thinking strategically from almost the first move.  You can't afford to waste a move or you run out of cards, or run out of outbreak cubes or have too many outbreaks.

There are just too many way to fail to save humanity! ;-)

Great challenging game of teamwork.
A bit of randomness due to the infection deck.
Potential problems if there is an over-bearing person in the group trying to force all of the decisions (not usually a problem for our group I don't think).
Love the challenge, and its a fairly short game which is good. Also nice to have a teamwork game for a change since our group is pretty cut-throat in the strategic games we usually play.

I played a few 4-player games at the start of the weekend...I think this game has tremendous potential to float to the top of the pile here on BGG. It appeals to the cooperative spirit, each game starts off differently (promising variety), the "intensify" aspect of the game really adds spice to an already compelling theme. We had a great time. We played 3 times in a row in the span of about 90 minutes (including learning the rules from scratch).

RATING: 7
I love the mechanics and components of this game (perhaps more than the gameplay itself).  By reshuffling city cards back into the top of the deck after an outbreak, the tension builds and builds.  Just a very creative piece of work.  I also am astounded by how often the game comes down to just 1 turn - one decision can mean the end of the world or total salvation.  Now that's evidence of a well-balanced and play-tested game.  I wish that the board was a little bigger and/or the pawns smaller.  I tend to play this one solo, as I'm just not convinced that it works well as a multiplayer coop experience.  This game feeds off of my germ-paranoia.

The game that started cooperative gaming for me. I quickly brought this game home to play with my family after playing it at a friends house. It was a bit overwhelming to them at first and I was a total alpha gamer just directing everyone's movements through the first couple play thoughs but now we all talk it out and I let them make plays even if they aren't the perfect play in my opinion. With the On the Brink expansion we've stepped up the difficulty and still enjoy it even if we don't win that often. The guys I play games with love this game too although we usually get into pretty heated discussions when you've got a bunch of alpha males at the table. The On the Brink Expansion is necessary for me since it adds so many roles and can up the difficulty significantly without making it impossible.

Pandemic is definitely overrated. If you absolutely love coops, you might enjoy this one. If you only occasionally play a coop, there are much better coop games out there. It really has that "we're playing against a set of rules" feel to it and doesn't really feel like you're battling disease outbreaks. You're also supposed to randomly draw roles, but some roles are significantly more helpful than others (good luck winning without a medic). There are other coops that do a much better job of portraying their theme than Pandemic. I would get them instead.

RATING: 3.5
This together with Arkham Horror was my first buy and the first game I burned out on (but we still play and love AH). 

This is weekly Monday business meeting with charts and maps and there's a problem and now we have to delegate who does what to solve this mess. Each character does something better than the rest, so it's you who has to deal with it. Beware: vulnerable to alfa dog syndrome. 

If you compare it to AH, it's dry, but if you play it after a Knizia and the like it feels pretty thematic, intuitive and interactive. You have to talk! About game objectives! Yay. Upped the ranking by 0.5

So it's a puzzle co-op which works well with nongamers and eurogamers and creates a neat nonconfrontational experience if that's what you're after (and you keep your alphas on a leash).  

-----------------------------
Played again. I've realised that working togehter and making plans is something I prefer to do with competent people and not just anybody. So I prefer lighter co-ops which don't require as much skill and can be played just to illustrate what is the value of "working together" (Forbidden Island or Escape would be my picks.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is as close as I have found to a perfect game. It can be played with others or alone and you can change up the rolls to add variety. I think everyone should have this game in their collection.  My only complaint is the difficulty. The easiest setting can be very difficult for new players. It becomes manageable after a few games though, and the harder settings will keep you coming back.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The mechanism of replacing the same cards on the top of the deck is this game's great trick. It works here and again on Forbidden Island. Pandemic is a fine challenge where you really feel the drama and the tension that the theme creates.
Like many co-ops, it suffers when an "expert" takes over for the other players, but don't listen to that guy! Fly to Istanbul if you want.
I have had many a fun night trying to save the world.

Chungo y extresante, siempre te da la impresion que estas a punto de palmarla y al final puedes ganar.
Le pongo un 8.5. Si no se quema, seguramente le subire la nota, y si se quema muy pronto se la bajare.
El dia del estreno, ya jugamos 3 partidas, pues son relativamente rapidas y te quedas con ganas de revancha.

Editado: Un juegazo que no aburre. Se lo pasa uno bien de 2 a 4 jug, por igual. Una vez que sabes jugar no es tan dificil. Nosotros tendremos que empezar a jugar en el nivel mas dificil.

Editado 2: En nivel intermedio, el juego toma su dificultad perfecta. Es dificil ganar, aunque si tienes suerte y jugais bien, se consigue.

Such a challenging game. And even when it kicks you down and knocks you out cold, you still want more. Be prepared to play the role of "abused board gamer" with Pandemic, but you'll love it anyway.

It's such a challenge that you will continually jump right back into the game headfirst with the thought "maybe... just maybe we can get it this time..."

Oh, and if you use the "On the Brink" expansion, you're freaking suicidal.... :P

I love the puzzle-like feel of the game, as well the building tension. The grim, yet realistic theme is also a winner in my book. Pandemic requires a fair amount of risk-taking, and it can really just boil down to the luck of the draw to win or lose the game. Also beware of the temptation to make decisions on behalf of other people too often!

#41 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Other coops are starting to replace this for me, as I rarely find myself wanting to play it. But I played this one a lot when I was new to the hobby. So I have a lot of  nostalgic and recognition for what it brought to the gaming industry. I like the On the Brink expansion a lot too. I haven't tried any of the others. Pandemic: Legacy was beyond amazing!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A cooperative game that takes the best of other games and throws out the useless bits. Where Kniza's LOTR is overly fiddly (too many paths), this one streamlines it (players use 4APs to perform actions). Where games like Terra had too much infighting, this one forces players to fully cooperate as there is a sense of urgency.

The outbreak system works well and so do the role cards. The game will probably get a little stale after you manage to win it on heroic and also because strategies will become more obvious after multiple plays...BUT it will take awhile to get there!

We played three games of this in a row and it has been awhile since a game made me jump up with excitement.

Update: Game gets stale after beating it a few times. Some roles are stronger than others and the theme is thin once people get into a 'system' of trying best to solve the puzzle.

This game's theme and gameplay are fantastic.

While being a nice gateway game I think that apart from that role there isn't much Pandemic does... As a cooperative game it pales in the light of vastly better games (like Robinson Crusoe or XCOM) to the point of becoming irrelevant. After playing a few games all that remains of Pandemic is a mediocre puzzle.
While I do own two expansions I'd like to note that I haven't played with those yet. They 'might' improve my rating slightly. It's on my to-do-list.

The gateway co-op game. It's a modern classic, suffers from alpha player but the theme is great and the rules are simple. Theres too much luck involved. It was great for it's time but the game gets stale after a while. I will still recommend it for people who have just started the hobby. The co-op aspect makes it less intimidating for new gamers that feel that they're not ready to compete. I feel like the game is a bit outdated and it rarely gets played anymore.

Pure co-op makes it rather a candidate for a one-player-game, but always a nice choice when playing with non-gamers or people who can't lose. Playing it with gamers usually gives long discussions about best next moves and different strategies.

Excellent cooperative game. Its mechanics are quite simple and easy to explain, but it can be hard to win. The pressure the game puts on you forces the group to think and discuss what's the best option every turn, especially during the late game. I love that kind of interaction between the players which makes Pandemic one of my favourite games.

I always play it with the "on the brink" expansion, with adds more variety and unpredictability to the game.

This finally made it to the table and I must say, it is vastly more difficult with four roles instead of just two.  We were obliterated both times on the introductory difficulty, while I seemingly easily defeated it by myself using two roles.  All said though, we learned a lot for the next times and had an absolute blast playing it.

I can at least interject that although the game materials have a "unique" smell, it is not overpowering or horrible.  Everything in the box looks to be top-quality, though.  I highly expect this will become one of my favorite games quite quickly.

RATING: 8
Just a blast to play with an awesome theme. I have a biased towards co-op games, as I love them, but the roles available in this are what really make it shine. Nothing like yelling for an hour for what the next turn will be.

RATING: 7
[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Cooperative. Enjoyed this. The game engine is more "statistical" than, say, Shadows Over Camelot, but the game feels more satisfying because there are more decisions for the players; in SOC I feel like once you decide which quest to go on, your turns are very short/boring for a while until you run out of cards or complete the quest. In Pandemic, you have to re-evaluate the situation on every turn when deciding what actions to take.

Like the co-op nature: it seems like a good exercise in not-being-a-tit to try and curtail dictatorial tendencies and ensure everyone enjoys the game :)

I also like the premise that there's one way for us to win, there are 3 ways for us to lose.  Sets the sense of peril up quite nicely from the off.

Overall, my cooperative game crown still goes to Knizia's Lord of the Rings. But while Lord of the Rings is a co-op game that really requires a group of "gamers", Pandemic is a go-to game for any group of people.

The tension around the table is just palpable playing Pandemic, and the game plays in under an hour, so it's really perfect for a weeknight get together with friends. To succeed, team members must really plan things out together. If each player simply pursues his or her own "plan", then the group is sure to lose the game, especially on Normal or (god forbid) Heroic settings. Pandemic is an ultra-cooperative game. This is its greatest asset, but also the thing about it which I foresee will put me off a bit over time. There is little room for autonomy and self-determination. Success requires the closest sort of collaboration. So be warned: play this only with people you like! If you play it with someone you don't have a lot of patience with, you *will* want to throttle them. Pandemic throws very difficult situations right in the face of the players, and good brainstorming is required to win the game. If someone is being boorish and trying to "quarterback" the whole game, you will be driven to distraction. Likewise if someone is being an utter dolt and failing to grasp the plan that the group came up with.

Again, VERY tense. VERY exciting. LOADS of fun. But play it with the right people. Otherwise Pandemic possesses the potential to devolve into an exercise in frustration. It also shines with 3-4 players, but the tension is significantly less with only 2. This is because 2 players can tightly coordinate their actions, working as a team and moving more or less together around the world in order to cure the diseases. With 3 and 4 players, it's harder to get ahead of the intensity curve - the point where, after a few epidemics, you start infecting new cities without any disease (and hence a lesser chance of outbreaks). Because of this, I think 3-4 player games are actually slightly more challenging than 2 player games.

Components: the board is crap. The disease cubes, pawns, research stations, and cards are all just fine. But I'd shell out another $10 for a decent board. This one warps, wrinkles, smells funny, and peels up from the edge. I like the size of it, I like the art and design. It's the physical quality which is just dismal. That's a shame when it affects such a super game.

Update: this one has settled at a perpetual 7 for me. When I like it, I love it. But it's not really something I'm in the mood for any time, in plenty of situations I'd just rather not play it. You have to be in the mood to do the group-think thing, communicating extensively with the other players at every turn, in order to win. And sometimes, I feel that players can make all the right choices (optimal ones) and still lose due to luck and game balance. If this weren't so, it is true that Pandemic would lose some tension, as it would become a puzzle - solvable by an experienced group of players. That would be a shame, and a downfall. Yet the game falls down anyway, as once you ARE very experienced, it is frustrating to lose a perfectly played game. For some reason, this complaint doesn't arise for me when playing Lord of the Rings. The balance of choices in LotR maintains at least the illusion that your success depends only on your choices.

Anyway, despite my gripes I rate Pandemic a "strong buy" for its accessibility, tension, and short play-time.

It seems VERY overrated to me.  It baffles me.  How can this game be ranked higher than Shadows Over Camelot?  

Quick games are nice, but I think this one might have been better with a variation for more map locations and more player decision-making options.  More could have been done with the theme.  I don't think the diseases are even named.  Diseases obey boundaries.  That's laughable.

Pandemic is one of the most critically acclaimed co-op board games out there, but if you ask me this game is a snooze fest. The game is simply too simple. As a guy who does math all day this game comes straight down to probability once you have a solid basis of what you are doing, and that bothers me to no end. If you're looking for a game to introduce people to the co-op genre I suppose this could work for a bit, but with games like Zombicide, the Lord of the Rings Card game, and Arkham Horror out there, I'd pass on this one.

From my perspective, the base game is too easy to win with because of the limited number of roles you have allow you to get a nice balance of everything you need.

A fun game if a bit simple. A game that started a whole series of similar games where you start your turn with several actions to hold the tide just for a bit longer, then you draw 2 cards looking to find a set of a single colour, and then something bad happens on the board. 

I can see how it might have looked amazing when it came out. In reality, these days there are much better alternatives, and Pandemic on its own feels very formulaic to me. I don't think I would ever say no if offered a session, but I'd never seek out to play it.

The idea of this game is awesome. Cooperating with your friends to rid the world of disease sounds like my kind of game. And to top it all off, every player has their own special skills to contribute to the team. I love it.

The thing that makes this game not fun are players like myself. I am a total Dictator. I'm the person who introduced the game to my friends and so automatically I fell into the teaching role, but, there's a fine line between teacher and dictator. I cross that line. I spend all game telling people what to do. Before people even take their turn I'm giving them "suggestions" and when they don't follow my "suggestions" I tell them how inefficient their turn was and how we will all fail because of them. I should just play this game solo. 

There needs to be some sort of rule or mechanic that prevents people like me from controlling the entire game.

Nagyon jó alaptörténetet találtak ki a játéknak. Vírusok terjednek a Földünkön, amit a csapatban dolgozó orvoscsoport próbál megfékezni az egész bolygón. Repülnek, egymásnak segítenek. Különböző szerepekkel rendelkező játékosok próbálják közösen a játék ellen bevetni minden tudásukat, amire szükség is lesz, mert a játék nehéznek mondható, bár mi az első játékunkat simán nyertük.

[2011-07-29]
A játékidő körülbelül 1 óra, ami akár újbóli vírusirtásra is lehetőséget ad. A játék jól súlyozható, a könnyen megtalálhatja minden csapat a saját izgalmas nehézségi szintjét. Változatos, a kártyák miatt mindig más egy-egy játék.

Ketten is tökéletesen működik a játék, akár 45 perc is lehet egy-egy parti, rossz esetben még kevesebb. Nagyon izgalmas minden menet, még veszteni sem illúzióromboló ebben a játékban.

Pandemic is the pseudo-grandfather of cooperative games. While it might not have been the first, it definitely made co-op a popular mechanic.

In its essence, it's a multi-player puzzle, with the players trying to out-smart a deck of cards. While that may not seem like much, the game is very good at inducing tension as the game progresses, which really makes Pandemic shine.

Pandemic is my favorite game. I really enjoy the teamwork that comes out of the unique character abilities that each player has. The game is somewhat like a puzzle, but not one that is easily solvable. There are many paths a team could take and it's up to the group to decide how best to deal with each situation that comes up. In that way, the theme works very well. It's masterful design that really got me going in board gaming and has helped me introduce the hobby to many others.

First of all, I didn't realize that this was a negotiation game where the goal is to try to take your turn the way you wish, rather than what everyone else is telling you to do.  This is an awesome exercise, though it ranks something along the lines of group Free Cell, where everyone debates the logistics of where everything should go.  It is a fun little experience and is really compelling.  I could very easily see playing this a couple times in an evening.  That said, I can also see getting burned out on it.

I was trying to judge it without comparison to Legacy, but its really difficult, Legacy is one of the best games I have ever played! 

The original Pandemic though is one of the first proper board games I played, if not the first, thinking about it - and I have had a really good time playing - I hear the expansions are good too, and at some point do want to get them and see how they change it, I think this will add some good things to differentiate between the game and Legacy, and will bring it back into our play pile after we finished Legacy.

As a co-op board game, I give this is a 6. As a solitaire puzzle, I think it deserves a 7. However, after sufficient # plays, you'll realize this game is more about luck and less about skills (I only played with 6 epidemic cards).

When it's possible to lose on your first turn, you know how much luck is involved in this game.

Wow! Pandemic is really really good.  My group played for the first time last night and was just blown away.  It's the first new game that we've played in a long while that we've decided to play the game again after playing it once... and then we played it a third time, and were it not so late, would have played it a fourth time.

I'm not usually one for co-op games, but this has a great feel to it where all of the players are working together to use their respective abilities to best quell the infection and outbreaks.  

On our second game, we nearly lost because of our hubris of thinking we had the entire thing sewn up -- I was holding the cure for the last disease, I was within range of a research station, and there had only been two outbreaks for the entire game.  But, we didn't notice that I could only reach the station, and that I would be out of actions to cure... we thought all was well, except that an epidemic hit, which caused the hot zone in South America to have an outbreak... that caused another outbreak... that caused another outbreak... suddenly we were in a crisis situation because we were down to the last yellow cube... any further activity in that area would lose the game for us (not to mention that we had just kicked the outbreak counter up by 3-4).  We did end up winning, but it was so interesting that the game could turn on us so quickly.

I look forward to playing this one again soon.

I like this game, but I haven't yet figured out how to make it work for every group. Usually one person ends up being the leader and everyone falls in line with very little debate, making it seem a bit mechanical. Some of the roles are fairly boring to play, too.

My first Coop and I really like it. It's not great though and I'm not sure if it will hold this rating with more plays. 

The epidemic card is the ONLY thing that's dangerous (and everything it leads to). I could have used some more elements to spice things op and keep us worried about more than just this one card. 

I want to try it with the "On the Brink" expansion. 

-----------Update------------
Lowered my rating with .5. After several plays it has lost some of it's wow factor. The expansion is definitely needed.

It would have been way cooler if players were defending earth from an alien invasion instead of running around curing diseases

Really enjoy this a lot. The randomness of the cards can sometimes create games that are way too easy or way too hard but that's part of the fun of never knowing what will happen each game. It does a good job of escalating the tension towards the end of the game and with more plays it forces people to communicate. Someone point out to me that they liked this game because in a lot of other games people can sometimes get lost in thought and don't talk much during the game but this game forces people to interact and pay attention to everyone elses turns. On top of all that it's just plain fun.

We had a difficult time making gaining positive synergies from our various special abilities, but I believe this will become easier with more experience.

The favorite for my girlfriend and me to play together. The game itself is rather simple, but the decisions and strategies are often very diverse. Should we contain over here? Should we try to cure this disease, even though that disease is suddenly outbreaking vereywhere? Should I bother sunsetting this disease, or start working on containing that one infecting Europe? Always fun, and always a challenge. In fact, everyone I've introduced this game too has loved it — most of the gifts I bought for everyone in Christmas '08 were Pandemic games.

Fantastic game! I love this spin on coop games! The story is great and the mechanics are well thought out. It is extremely hard to come up with a game of this stature, and they delivered!

The main reason is that there is a high level of strategy involved.

I have never played a cooperation game before so Pandemic was my introduction. It did not disappoint. I plays very quickly (under 1 hour) and has more table talk than China Town. Taking on one of five different roles, players try to cooperate and squash four different infections across the globe. Proper coordination is the key as you must work in harmony to get workers to the right places at the right time and tweak your engine. The Outbreaks make the game very very difficult and spread so rapidly its easy to get overwhelmed and subsequently pummeled. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Brilliant design. This is a game that truly meets the criteria "for non-gamers and gamers alike". Great two player or solo game as well. Very compact box, easy to travel with and sets up pretty fast. 

The real crux of the game, and why it is rated so highly by most, is the card driven mechanic that ramps up the intensity in a perfectly escalating trend of greater and greater alarm and sheer panic. Can be very intense and fun the whole way through. 

One criticism: the player pawns are way too big for the map. We use miniature figures instead of the pawns now anyway, so no biggie. Yes, i know the expansion fixes this.  

Note - changed rating from 9 to 8. Problem is that because of the luck of the cards, there are times when you just simply can not win. On the other hand, there are times that you win rather easily because the cards just came out that way. Still a wonderful game and an easy 8, but had to drop my respect slightly because this aspect of the game tends to frustrate one the more you play.

Played once.

This is a pretty interesting co-op game which, like most co-op games, has a nice narrative.  The board is a map of the world with regions delineated by color (East Asia is red, for example).  The presence of disease is noted by placing cubes into a city, and the placements are based on a somewhat random card draw at the end of each player's turn.  If a city ever gets more than three cubes, there is an outbreak, and all connecting cities get cubes of that color.  The game is over when players either cure all four diseases or there are more than nine outbreaks.  

On a player's turn, there are eight possible actions, some of which are made easier by the roles that are selected at the start of the game.  You need to move quickly around the board and clear cubes out in anticipation of the next outbreak.  There's also trading of cards between players to achieve a cure.  So the fun part of the game is working together to figure out the most efficient way for each player to spend their turn.

That said, most of the decisions in that regard are fairly obvious.  You do have some idea of what cities are likely to experience repeated infections, and which are less likely, so you can anticipate outbreaks.  It's also fairly plain that you can't afford to have two connected cities with three cubes each, since that would trigger a double outbreak, which cuts way down on the time you have to get cures.  

In short, this is a really straightforward game with a great narrative, about a 70:30 strategy to luck ratio, that can be taught and played in about 45 minutes.  It looks good and was pretty fun for my one play.  I'm a little unsure of its long-term replayability, but I can see some potential for expansions.  I'd particularly like to see some random event cards that were conditionally helpful or hindering, so you had more of a decision than to automatically use them.

RATING: 7.5
I can see why this game is so popular! Easy to teach to new players, and serves as a good gateway game. My wife and I enjoy this game and it sees the table often enough.

I however do not find it as exciting as fist time players do. It has worn dry for me after a few plays.
 
The game with two players seems too easy, while probably best with 4 this causes another problem; This is where an issue for me comes in; the Alpha gamer syndrome. Eventhough I try and avoid this at all costs, when playing as a team everyone wants to win, and look to the most experience for "guidance"... It's almost unavoidable.

In the end it is defiantly a good game, especially if your group likes pure coops.

This co-op game is nice in that it allows the players to control the difficulty.  If you're playing with a group of new players you may choose to use the minimum number of epedimic cards in the infection deck.  If you are playing with a group of experienced Pandemic players who want a real challenge then load up the infection deck with all of the epedimic cards...just don't expect to win.  Great fun for all, with multiple roles to choose from offering good replayability.

The "shuffle the discards and put them on TOP of the remaining deck" is probably the single mechanic that lifted this to a "10" in my estimation.  Very appropriate to the way mutation works that the new strains (and therefore new outbreaks) come from the longterm diseased places.  This is not merely a theme tacked onto a game.  (MANY of my favorite games ARE theme-tacked-on games but this mechanic adds elegance and atmosphere to the game.  Play balance is great.  (I play Heroic Level; I generally lose...)

RATING: 7.5
The problem I have is that even if my fellow players and I have an optimal strategy, too much luck is involved in determining whether we win or not. The roles are not balanced, and difficulty is not scalable with more players. A Medic and Scientist with 5 epidemics is much easier than 4 players with 5 epis, or with 4 players and 4 epis. Who wants to play a game where you constantly fail only because of bad luck?
This can be fixed by forcing the epidemics to be in certain areas of the player's deck, but it should have been addressed in the game.

This co-op - a genre I really wanted to like - fixed all the problems I have with Lord of the Rings, like linearity and the playing time. I like how every game feels differently because of the randomly chosen roles and the way the diseases spread around.
I really feel I have to win. a) I want to save the world. b) I don't want to be beaten by some cardboard and wooden bits...
Still, after over 20 plays its appeal was fading quite a bit. The expansion solves this, by adding different variants, which increase difficulty not just by adding more epidemic cards to the deck.

One of the great co-operative games.  Very well produced - looks great when set up and playing, except for the dumb over-sized pawns. [We prefer to use appropriately coloured Meeples anyway - even after the OTB expansion replacements].

The game can be unforgiving of bad tactics (remember the victory conditions!), and even with good play the end-games can be very tense/exciting.  The different player roles add to interest and variety, and each has its uses if played right.  Rules are pretty easy to learn, and are very well set out.  Will appeal to most gamers, and non-gamers frankly - provided that the theme does not put them off.  VERY highly recommended.

RATING: 5
Great theme and design for a co-op, although I'm almost disappointed that our group won our first game. I suspect that this game becomes less interesting the better you get at it, which is the opposite of what I typically look for. Still, for what it is, and with the right group, Pandemic is fun. I'd be happy to play again in similar circumstances. But I don't see myself requesting it over a good competitive game.

After another play with a different group and another win, I feel the same as I did after my first play. I guess I should be playing it at the highest level of difficulty. Even so, I'm not sure how I feel about co-ops like Pandemic. You play against the system; you try to be as efficient as you can; and you hope that the cards don't kill you. True, there's some excitement in that, but it's sobering to look at the game from an analytical point of view and realize that ultimately your choices may not matter.

Got this for Christmas 2014. I would like to get this for my Healthcare classroom with high school students but the family likes it too much.  My son got addicted to the fan-made IPad version of it.  He has played with all the various roles and events.  I think the base game is too easy for him.  We have the legacy game for home.  I am bringing this back to the classroom. I also picked up a second copy.  I think I need 5 total for the class. Always looking for used ones...

The game is a puzzle.   Once you solve it - it isn't that fun unless you jack the difficulty setting beyond what the game was intended to.

I'm putting it up for trade. In terms of C-Ops, Defenders of the Realm does what pandemic does better in terms of stopping things from spreading - and I find Ghost Stories to be a more fun puzzle to solve. .

I love this game so far! I've played it by myself, two player and three player. I have the version with the two new roles (Quarantine Specialist and Contingency Planner). I think playing with one role isn't nearly as fun as multiple roles with fewer players. Game play is always a bit different depending on the roles and strategies they demand, but I can see this maybe getting too predictable if you play it a lot.

I enjoy a good game of pandemic.  Unpopular opinion time though; after a few games it seems to loose quite a lot of pazaz.  Also there can often feel like 'obviously best' moves which take the fun and drama down and new players can often get easily railroaded and 'taken over' by the group.  Still a great game though

Update after a few solo games on iOS
As a solo game (which, for me, is the only way most cooperative games should be played), this rates at least a 6.


----
A quick-playing cooperative game. Sometimes it's quick because it's impossible to solve! A fun activity, but more like a group puzzle than a game. It has the same silly rule as Lord of the Rings: players may share ANY information freely, but may not actually show each other their cards. I MUCH prefer Shadows Over Camelot. However, this game does have an interesting theme, plays very quickly, and has a very clever way of mimicking disease spread. It's also scalable, similar to Vanished Planet (add more Epidemic cards to the deck to increase difficulty). Players MUST work together -- each character's power can be helpful if used correctly.

But I don't like co-ops! For me, this is a 3/10 on the BGG scale.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a brilliant game when it comes down to it. I would give it a 10, but it's been suggested to me before and I wasn't 100% on board to play so I'm tentatively going to give it a 9. So many great ideas. A scaling difficulty for replayability, it being co-operative, while not seeming like one person is actually making all the decisions and the goal feeling pretty good once you do accomplish it.

Beating it on the highest difficulty is a challenge.

Love this co-op. One of the best out there. Even with some luck element it's very strategic, requires planning ahead and full cooperation of all the players involved. Scales great with players. The first expansion adds so much variety to the game with all those new characters and special cards, it's really amazing to play this.

I've played hundreds of games of this and will continue to play. Legendary difficulty awaits.

I enjoy pandemic but so far am not really a huge fan of cooperative games as I like the competition and mental battle between human players. The player interaction is good if you have the right people, but at times the game feels like you are solving a puzzle you could solve alone.

It doesn't seem that the choices are that difficult and it usually boils down to how quickly the epidemic cards come out.  Still a light, fun game, despite the fact that I'm not big on cooperative games.

This was my first cooperative board game, something my wife loves.  She loves to work as a team and win together plus it gives the opportunity to hold a new player's hand and play through a game while teaching it to them.  This game is not easy though, something I like a little bit more than my wife.  I love a great challenge that pushes your mental boundaries and really makes you work for it.  All the sweeter when you do win.

Having played a few more times now the game is not as difficult as I originally thought, especially compared to some other cooperative board games.  You simply need to learn the best tactics which comes with repeated plays.  I'm just afraid that with that also comes a lack of interest as the game grows predictable and less challenging.

I like corporative games but pandemic didn´t really put up a fight when we played it. First time it was a real walk in the park. The second time we got the feeling that it could be hard if we had less luck but it was a sure win. I want to try the game with more than 2 players which I read should make it more difficult, and if I would play it at 2 players again, I would play at the hardest setting (and yes, we played according to all the rules, I was sure we missed something making it to easy but no).

Alpha gamer at it's best/worst. I get why people like this game and if it was just a single player game it'd be fine, unfortunately it's not. This means that people who have experience end up either leading the way or shutting up and letting the new players figure things out.  Either way this doesn't make for a very fun game most of the time.

Sometimes you'll end up with players of comparable skill and you'll get some interesting conversations about what path to take but generally there is a "right" move to make and while it may not pay off due to luck/chance it was still the correct move to make with the available information.

One of the most fun games I've ever played. It's incredibly fun.
Very difficult to master. I've played it 3 times so far and didn't win it yet. I hope that when I do I still find the game challenging enough to like.

21/07/08
The game is becoming easier play after play but I still didn't try it with the 6 epidemic cards. The luck involved could be important to win the game or not. Some cycles of cards could be crucial to determine if there's a winner or not.

As I expected Pandemic turned out to be less fun with time. It's still a good catch for newbies though and that's something I have to underline here. My wife started to like/play games after Pandemic.

An interesting concept based on curing diseases around the world. This game does rather have a huge "luck" factor to it as if you are able to avoid the epidemic cards, you can easily win the game. The variety of levels included makes the replay value increase.

Also, this game does require cooperative play - at times you may not even make your own decision as most moves later in the game are decided as a group rather than on your own.

Co-op in its purest form, love the theme and always had a thing for world maps (cute that the German city is Essen). Since I played Forbidden Island first, I recognized many mechanics but I think they are executed better in Pandemic, the game is just more interesting, gripping and tougher to win so I take this over FI any day (though FI really is a sweet one, too). It is a very accessible game on top of all the good aspects!
I still think there is some room for 'more' in the field of cooperative games but would be happy to play Pandemic more.

First co-op. Takes a while to setup and we messed up on the rules at first but its a lot of fun once we get into it. A lot harder than I thought it would be.
2016.9.20 Update:
Rating reduced to by 1 point to a 7. This just doesn't make it to the table much due to length of setup and length of game. Forbidden Island is easier to get out after the kids go to bed and before we're too tired to think about saving the world for deadly diseases.

I'm not into co-ops usually but I like it. Feels tight enough. Don't like how events are triggered as they're drawn from a deck but I can't think of another way to program an "AI" that doesn't involve a lot of mental leg work for the players.

Board is also smaller and more compact than I thought. Might actually appropriate to bring to cafes and such.

Ah, Pandemic. Bumped the score up a few times recently - it's another of those games that you can play with anyone - grannies and grandads playing over Christmas, and enjoying it every bit as much as I do. Great stuff. First time we played with wife's sister and her husband, we decided that the roles are named as follows - and it's stuck:

Dispatcher: George Fink
Scientist: Blessing Ekwale
Medic: Jose Delacruz
Operations: Mike Popowski
Researcher: Jean Biehn

"Goddamn it, Popowski, just do your job!"

EDIT: A year or so on, and it's still doing its job! 3 games in a row (with On the Brink) with dad and sister over Christmas - they're fans too!

EDIT 2: July 2011 had this at an 8.5 - bumping up as it's just still fab.

The Scandinavian version is said to have very small text, due to Swedish and Finnish being squashed onto the cards. This is true, the text is very small on the role cards for example. The map has a few city names in both languages, maybe not the prettiest but I honestly do not care as much as I thought I would. I care more about the game =)

The small text on the cards you will likely not need to read after playing only a few times, so its fine really.

Also, we won the first time, and lost the second time we played! I would call that a very well balanced game in its "beginner" mode, well done!

I have played this (solo) on the app more times than I dare count, but the actual board game has only come to the table a few times. (Only because there have been so many other games to try.) It will be interesting to see if we'll come back to this with some of the untried expansions after finishing Pandemic Legacy. For now, our copy of vanilla Pandemic is on loan to some friends who "wanted to get back into board games" and "were thinking of picking up copies of Monopoly and Scrabble".

The first game i have purchased whilst it is still a novelty. And after 1 play i'd say it is fun, but not earth shatteringly great. Edit, we were playing it wrong...2nd play, there is tension as you race against the diseases and the cards, any longevity it may have will be because of the co-op play. Beautifully produced game, however there is something a little dry about the game, not naming the diseases was a mistake. This game also needs outgoing and gregarious players to be enjoyed, in fact it's a total misery without a good group. I think i prefer Shadows over Camelot [and BSG], however this is quicker and works well with 2 so both have their place. The more i play the more i look on it with admiration but not love. Great with family and non-gamers though.

Pandemic is a little overhyped for me. 

Nice complexity to it, and you can feel the tenseness 
when virii break out all over the place. 
But the game too me is more a puzzle then a game. I have the same feeling about Ghost Stories. 

Somehow I miss the individuality of player turns. Sure players can decide what to do. But mostly it is a group effort to get to the most optimal solution. 

Playing with new players makes the game a hassle. 
Mostly it involves them asking and telling them what to do.

Don't get me wrong, the game is not bad. And i like to play it. It's just......not worth the hype it got.

Copycat purchase.  many plays prior to joining BGG. after many competetive games of catan, carcassonne etc, tempers wouldn't necessarily flare but we needed something to take the edge off competition, so here comes pandemic.  still a very good game.  challenging and tense and things can spiral out of controll very quickly.  we have gravitated to having favored roles so many times we just pick who we want to play, sometimes have a random draw.  we like to cooperative aspect and has lead to purchases of mice & mystics, star trek expeditions, yggdrasil and a touch of evil(which can be competitve or cooperative).  so it opened a new world of gaming, the cooperative idea.  haven'f felt the need for the expansion since we haven't mastered the base game with all epidemics yet.  kids have grown into liking this as well so it will be well loved for many years yet.

It's a cool game; everyone enjoys it.  The game system terrorizes the players well, feeling like a malevolent force.

Can suffer from one player telling everyone what to do . . . one house rule was that you had to play a card to even TALK when it wasn't your turn.

My only quibble is that it's remarkably difficult with four players, much more so than with two or three.

Love this game!  The tension that rises as you work together to fight off the diseases is so exciting!  When you add in the extra expansions (which I highly recommend) then the game gets even more exciting and more thematic.  Only down side is the alpha gamer tendency which is so prevalent with co-ops.  Not being a fan of cubes I did pimp out my game with the virus counters from Etsy.  highly recommend!

I also own the expansions:
-In the Lab
-On the Brink

Nice and smooth co-op. I like that it's pretty short and not too complicated (although the rules for passing cards and the various roles still puzzle me a bit). But it still doesn't hold a candle to Lord of the Rings, which reigns supreme over all co-ops. It's just so much more engaging and exciting!

Played this twice on BSW, but as expected, that just doesn't work very well.

RATING: 7.5
Pandemic plays a bit like Arkham Horror, only you're stamping out infections instead of killing monsters, and finding cures instead of sealing gates. The difference is that Pandemic is far simpler and takes a fraction of the time to play, and is thus easier to get to the table with casual gamers. I'd rather play a meatier game when opportunity arises, but this is good fun to play with the family, and quite challenging when played at the Heroic level.

[edit] Now that I have Forbidden Island, Pandemic may be tougher to find time for. Forbidden Island is quicker, simpler and easier for the non-gamers, so will be chosen more frequently. Pandemic may become a "next step" game for Forbidden Island players that seek a bit more depth.

I find cooperative games to be hit or miss, and this one isn't a hit.  There are no real personal decisions to make since this is more of a group think puzzle than anything else.  I played once to check it out, but I don't think I'll be playing again.  Just too boring.

+ Coop mechanics (infection, propagation) are well though out and accessible

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- Crazy alpha player syndrome
- Really swingy from too easy to impossible
- Theme is depressive
- Doesn't renew itself enough to justify repeated play

:star: VERDICT
The more I play this one, the least I like it. By the end of the game, you always know in advance if you're gonna make it or not, so it's just a matter of bringing to game to end
As for introducing newbies to games, it's bad because they won't take any initiative and they will follow up the more experienced players. 
Still, the theme is unique (but depressive too) and the coop play is fun and fast.
Forbidden Island is my Leacock go to coop game. So much better than Pandemic for me.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love almost everything about this game. It's got an interesting theme that fits well with the game. It's got good replayability due to the roles and the different levels of difficulty. It plays quickly and is fairly easy to teach, while still having some depth. I like the puzzlelike feel of the game, and it's a great option for solitaire play. My only little problem with it is that in some games, you can see a win or a loss coming before the end. These are balanced out, however, by a good number of nail-biting endings. One of my favorites.

Update: The game gets even better with the On the Brink expansion.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
There's no doubt that in the couple of co-operative board games I have played, players seem to be very much at the mercy of the cards that come up.  But the thing is, co-operative games are all about the experience, and that's what I love about them.  Pandemic definitely shines in this regard.  It is fun to strategize as a team, come up with a plan of attack, and sweat it out together as the odds seem to build against you.  It's theme is unique and very well-implemented, and while I would have preferred if they had named the diseases, I can see why they chose not to.  The components are basic and the board is a little small, but it all comes in a very compact and very portable box.  The game itself is remarkably easy to learn and is well-suited to playing with non-gamers.  I don't know how it will hold up with repeat plays, but so far I've played with 2, 3, 4, and 5 players, and we've had a lot of fun every time.  [Edit: I now know that, for myself at least, it doesn't hold up really well with repeat plays, and my rating has dropped.  I find myself fairly bored with this board game, yet it remains one of my wife's all-time favourites.  Go figure.  I'm interested to see if an expansion will revitalize my interest.]  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 9
In March of 2008, I played this new game that I had heard absolutely nothing about beforehand. A few folks saw some good reviews and I played it once.

28 game plays later, this is a great cooperative game.  The plays have slowed down a bit (we did obsess over it for a while!), but still is brought to the table often.

As with most folks, the winning record is below .500. Our team has won 11 out of the 28 games (all but a few at the Normal level). All but 3 of the losses were via 8 outbreaks. In about half of the losses, we were one to three rounds away from winning. (Truth in advertising - in most of our wins, we were one wrong card away from losing!!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
We tried hard to like this game but we think it's the co-op mechanic and fiddliness that we don't enjoy. We find it hard to avoid the "follow-the-leader" strategy (one person makes a suggestion and everyone else complies). The unintuitive card setup and pawn movements also deter from the experience. But there is still something about it that makes me pull it out for the occasional session. I also don't think its as great a gateway as many people believe. We've had MUCH more success with TtR, Qwirkle, Blokus and Carc.  

UPDATE: Played for the first time with 4 players after only 2 player games previously. It plays much better with more...rating increased from 6.5 to 7.5.

Great theme play.  Easy to learn and play (although we just can't seem to get the rules right).  Play requires close planning on the part of the players and can be tense.  The components are excellent - mounted board, wood pieces and durable cards.  Game length is perfect at a little over an hour.

RATING: N/A
Played this before I played Forbidden Island. I'd rather play FI. It's probably best with people you know, rather than a pickup game of strangers, because the play experience hinges on how everyone works with each other.

I found the rules fairly easy to understand, but the actual play to be challenging. Despite the rules discouraging it, there is a very strong tendency for the most experienced player to basically run the game; and to be honest, without someone directing the other players to act together, it seems pretty likely you're all going to lose. There were several times during the game when, if left without guidance, I would have performed what seemed to me to be "good" actions, which in hindsight would have doomed humanity.

Fantastic coop. Goes over like gangbusters with every group so far. Still need to try it 2p, so far 4p has always been a tense and exciting gameplay.

RATING: 10
Bumped this up to a 10 because the epidemic mechanic really is wonderful. Every game feels like a puzzle which has a definite solution, and as a result failure feels like you've slipped up somewhere, rather than the game ever being unfair (apart from the game when my sister and I lost after 3 turns).

One that everyone should own.

RATING: 7.5
[3 plays] Initial reaction rating.  I did enjoy getting to try this game, and would love to play it more.  It played a lot faster than I expected.  It provided an intense fun time.  The game system seems solid.  Really it can play quick enough to be considered a filler game, yet has a lot going on and seems better than a lot of filler games.  I have played three and four players, and we have both lost and won.  It has been good gaming experiences so far.

RATING: 7.5
[Z-man 2008 edition] {Pathology; variable-player-power, cooperative; scalable}  {4/5-Epidemic: 7; 6-Epidemic: 7.5} Pandemic is a thematic cooperative game.  The mechanic is familiar - players play cards for their own good and cards for the 'evil'.  It's not ground-breaking but it is very fun to play.

The game is engaging, esp. with more epidemic cards.  I prefer the 6-Epidemic setup.  It is just so exciting that epidemics happen again and again and players are busily cure the disease and yet finding cure in the same time.  However, it is anti-climax at late game when the result is almost determined.  There are nearly no surprise.  Essentially, it's a card collection game.  Players have the shared goal to collect 4 sets of cards with limited time and resources.  The challenge is how players can optimize their moves together to achieve the goal.  Comparatively short playing time and scalable with few players (2-3 players) are its selling point.

It is too easy to have a player (or leader) dominating the game.  This leader will instruct every other player to follow the best plan in order to win. That won't be fun at all!

Thematically, I think it can be expanded to include some hidden elements for the cure that the players have to hunt for in the game.

The components are quite nice.  The board is sturdy.  The cardstock is thick enough.  The card illustration is nice and effective, even though there are pieces of wrong information.  The pawns are too large but the cure markers are too small.

As with all straight co-ops it requires certain group dynamic (all players engaged, all with similar skill level, none of them too bossy). When I find such a group I will probably enjoy this game much more.

RATING: 8
Interesting cooperative game of fighting disease outbreaks around the world.  Each player has a special talent which in most cases is critical to victory (some talents are more useful than others).  Perhaps we're doing something wrong, but the game seems much easier with two players than with four: with two, the deck runs slower, and the cards you need to cure diseases are not scattered across four hands.

I can see why this is so universally complemented. It is a fine co-op that is easy to learn and somewhat fiendish to beat, though once you do you'll feel you were lucky rather than skillful.

RATING: 7
Amazing game. Best co-op I have played. It can be very frustrating though. I would rate it a 9, but losing and winning is just not that satisfying. A problem not with the game, but with the co-op genre in general.

UPDATE: Not as good as Flash Point, IMO. Rarely gets played anymore. Would not suggest it, as Flash Point will get the nod every time. I will play it, no question, if someone else wants to. Moves down from 8 to 7. 

UPDATE 2: Pandemic has regained its charm over time, and is equally as good as Flash Point. Pandemic is not as satisfying to play solo, but is the stronger strategic game. The roles are better implemented in Pandemic, IMO. Every role can be very useful and wont change your overall strategy too much (unlike Flash Point). Stays at 7.

RATING: 8
This is a fun game that my wife and I enjoy playing together. She's a casual gamer and doesn't enjoy highly competitive or complex games so the cooperative gameplay is really appealing. Also, it's quite therapeutic and a good exercise in "team-building" as it forces players to work together for the same goals. Rules are easy to learn and teach and games last 30-45 minutes. The gameboard, cards and pieces are of good quality and the theme is really well done. Pandemic is a great choice for casual gamers and offers good replayability. When the time comes where we grow tired of the base game, there are several expansions that we can buy to extend it's life. I'd recommend this game to any of my friends looking for an easy to learn, enjoyable game to play.

Nobody from my group liked this game. We played three times, beat it once, but it all felt like work rather than pleasure. Cubes pile up and you have to shovel them away and plug the source of them before a value exceeds a threshold. Could as well be corporate paper-work the game. Gee, there's quarterly reports piling up in Chicago, better send Betty there, accounting is her specialty!

I'm a big fan of cooperative games. This is a favorite. It does a really good job of providing meaningful decisions to make. It also does a good job of putting pressure on you so you feel like you are really trying to win, not just have a nice cooperative "experience."

The game I played most at Gathering 2008. In one week I've already played it more than I've played LotR and Shadows Over Camelot *combined*. In some ways, it's more fun and exciting to lose than it is to win, which can feel oddly disappointing.

Very nice little co-op game. Almost always hard to beat. I don't know how many times I have thought halfway through the game "Hah, this will be a walk in the park", only to then marvel at the clever mechanics that suddenly accelerates the diseases turning them absolutely deadly. The rating jumps to 8.5 with the expansion "On the Brink".

I was at a wargame convention, and someone pulled out this game. Two plays later and I liked the game. A fresh and fun design whose rating will likely increase with more plays (but those plays have not occurred).

RATING: 7
This is a truly co-operative game. There is no traitor or no individual winner, you either beat the game and all win or you all lose, which leads me to suspect that all the roles can easily be played by one player and the game is of course on auto-pilot so really is a quite good solo game masquerading as a 2-4 player.

RATING: 7
Appears a very difficult game to win.  I've seen about 4-5 games with only one victory.  When I was on the team that one 3 of the guys were advanced to expert players.  Plays kind of like a chess game, that you really have to concentrate on maximizing your turn/movement efficiency.

A fast co-operative that encourages repeat plays. It's the best of the co-operative games in my collection.

Wow!  We played this for the first time tonight and then turned around and played it SEVEN more times.  I've now played it with everything from 2 to 4 players and it plays great (albeit slightly differently) with each number.  The game is quick (under 45 minutes), challenging and fun.  It plays a little differently each time.  An excellent game.  One of the best of the cooperative genre.

Since co-op games are a little odd, my rating is basically relative to LotR or SoC. Pandemic scores against these by having a more interesting theme, and requiring more movement in gameplay. LotR feels like walking down a road. SoC often feels like "I'll go over here and hang around for a few turns". Pandemic requires you to buzz around prioritising your actions; acquiring the cards to discover a series of cures while fire-fighting outbreaks. And all the while the clock is ticking. First four plays gave a couple of close wins (one turn from losing), and a spectacularly dreadful 17-minute loss when we failed to get to grips with an unlucky S.America setup. And we haven't moved beyond the beginers version yet. Very clever infection deck mechanism to re-infect locations.

Update: Rating reduced because after the first 5 plays, nobody has asked to play again.

This is the seminal co-op game for me. It's euro-ish enough that you never feel totally screwed by any random dice rolls, light and quick enough that you can fit in a quick game of an evening, scales well from 2 to 4 players. And my wife likes it. Couldn't ask for more.

This is a game even my wife will play, and I really like it. It's frightening how those viruses can break out suddenly.

A great game and all the better for being a Family game.

1/2/15 - Been playing this solo recently with the new solo rules (featured in In The Lab rules). I am going to add a point to my rating for how well it plays solo! 8 > 9

I have enjoyed the solo play so much I have bought the In The Lab expansion. More great solo play.

1/10/15 - Finally, upgraded to the 2nd version and added On the Brink. Complete. Looking forward to all the variations possible.

RATING: 7
Clever game that, oddly, is much more enjoyable when you lose or have a tough time winning.  There is the potential problem of the "best" or most experienced player kind of directing everyone else what to do in which case it puts a whole new spin on "multiplayer solitaire".  A good gaming group will find the right balance of interaction and personal decision though... at least in my experience.

My daughter (6yo) loves this co-op game! It's really nice how the difficulty can be adjusted to challenge us both.

Due to my wife not being a fan of co-op games, I have mainly ended up playing this with my daughter who loves anything 'medical'. Our games have mainly ended up winning and there is a nice balance to the game which you can influence the difficulty by the number of infect cards though we have only ever played this as the medic and scientist!! Not interested in getting the expansions as I think there is enough game here already.

Fun at first, but doesn't have very good replayability or the variety that I enjoy. Still, a good co-op game that I'd like to play every now and then, especially with newer gamers. The problem is that it isn't really cooperative, and more like one person telling the others what is best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game has great co-op action, and adjustable to any skill level. This is one game my wife takes seriously (and so it gets extra points). 

My one gripe about it is that if one or two people have excess experience, and the rest of the players are new, it is sooo hard for the experienced player not to take over everyone's turns.

Very fun, strategic game.  The only downside that I can find to this game is that it takes so much team effort, there's almost no point in having "individual turns".  Meaning, it's almost a group effort on everyone's turn planning out what the best action/decision is, leaving not a lot of individual decision making.

When I got pandemic I loved it so much.  As time went by though, I figured it out.  Fortunately, Z-man knew that pandemic had this problem and prodcued it's expansion to fix it, which makes Pandemic a real gem!

I own Pandemic: On the Brink as well.

On On the Brink: This expanison adds almost limitless replayability to the game.  Having 7 epidemic cards in the deck makes it almost impossible, but a great time for all as you try to stop the chaos!

I love cooperative games because  I think they are good for our family.  I also like that I can play them solo (adds to the replay value for me).  This  was the first coop that I played outside of my family  and  it wasn't a  fun experience.  The person who taught us the game was a little argumentative with another player.  The experience turned me off.  I didn't like how you move around in the game either.  I  will stick with flashpoint.

Update:  My 7 year old daughter really likes cooperative games so I thought I would give this a try with her.  Turns out we like it.  I think the group dynamics of my first game turned me off, but both my wife and daughter like it so Pandemic is a keeper.

This was a purchase based on many recommendations and boy were we not disappointed! We've learned that we truly enjoy co-op games. Especially with the kids, although we haven't had them try this yet. The nice thing with co-op is having to make combined decisions and planning. We haven't had the Alpha player syndrome that some people have with them, mainly because we are an easy going family.

Excellent job on a co-op game.  Its tense and exciting, but very easy to learn and play.  Plays fast, and the variety of roles make each game a bit different.  Plays great with 2 and 4 (though 2 players seems a bit easier).  No reason you couldn't play solo; just use 2 pawns and keep the hands separate.

Very fun cooperative game. Difficult enough to be interesting, but not unbeatable. Plays in a short amount of time and is accessible to non-gamers.

Update: this seems to be a go-to game if you're going to be gaming with people who are new to boardgames. It has enough depth to still be interesting to Pandemic vets, while not being overwhelming to newbies. Just be careful to watch the "dominant player" problem common to co-ops.

Threatening diseases, ticking clock, world in peril, must be time for Pandemic. Cooperative gameplay at its finest. One way to win, so many ways to lose, but any game you have fun losing with friends is better than a game that loses you friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Wonderful co-op game.  The roller coaster that this game provides is like none other that I've ever experienced(Until XCOM).  It seems to play quickly and encourages plenty of table discussion each turn.  It is very easy to learn as the turns play simple, but very difficult to master.  My only turn-off to this game is that I just do not enjoy it 2 player very much.

EDIT:  After playing numerous times with numerous different people, it just feels like I'm solving a puzzle.  Sure it is a different puzzle each time, but it is also fairly easy to know the best move, and I hate that.  I hate feeling that I have an answer to the game almost immediately after setup.

Fun co-operative game that provides a satisfying amount of tension. Players take the roles of a team fighting the outbreak of four different diseases worldwide. Each turn players have four actions to either move, cure a disease, build a research centre or transfer cards to other players. Each player has a unique roll (the medic can treat more diseases, the researcher can transfer cards more easily, the scientist doesn't need as many cards in order to cure a disease etc), and once all four diseases have been cured the game has been won. It can be a tense affair as the diseases begin to spread more quickly and areas have to be prioritised and it can also be a tough game to beat. Strategies are pretty obvious but this is a game where one mistake can lead to defeat.

Laura's Rank (3/15) – 5 out of 5. Pros: I like cooperative games overall. The theme is played out so well that even competitive people will get drawn into beating the board. I love that you can control the difficulty with the epidemic cards. You can play it over and over and have it still be interesting and challenging. I love the components and how it looks when you are overwhelmed with diseases. Great player interaction. You have to work together as a team, which is not necessarily true of all cooperative games. So many ways to die. Just a great game. Complicated enough to think through strategies, but not so complicated that you can't have fun the first time you play.

Ryan's Rank (3/15) – 5 out of 5. This is a great game. Easily my favorite cooperative. Love the theme. Love the mechanics. Love that you really have to work as a team to beat the game. There are some tense moments that come in the game, and Laura and I tend to get into it. Our friends have also taken to it as well.

Played 10+ times.  Very good co-op game.  A neat combination of mechanics.  I love how the infection deck keeps getting shuffled and put back on top.  Such an innovative way to increase the importance of certain cities.  The epidemic, movement, disease curing and  eradication and character special powers all combine to create a very tight-nit, fluid game.  Fun to play.  2010/01/15

Solid, and the de-facto classic cooperative board game. Well worth putting into your collection if you're tired of "everybody for themselves" types of games (or just want to play something that breaks out of that mould.) The base game on its own is well worth the money. The "On the Brink" expansion, though, adds so much to the game, I'd rate it a must have if you get the base game.

Great, simple cooperative game.  Players play agents of the Centre for Disease Control and try to contain 4 different diseases spreading throughout the world.  Each player chooses a different role that has a different special ability.  Players have to travel throughout the world to contain diseases and eventually research cures for them.

This game is quite simple to play and yet quite fun.  It is easy to teach to new players.  I highly recommend this game to introduce new players to board games and/or cooperative games.

The game can be played with 2 to 4 players.  I find that it is easiest with 3 players and hardest with 4 players.  The difficulty level of the game can be adjusted to make it harder for veteran players.

I have the 2013 version.  This fixes some balance issues with one of the roles and adds a new ones.  It also removes one role (the Generalist) which is balanced, but somewhat uninteresting.  Overall, I find that every role is interesting to play and has a unique advantage to help win the game.

Not a deep game, but it is engaging and excellent for casual gamers.  Better with more players as the complexity rises and it becomes more about how the special abilities of each player can be used together to help out the team.  Interaction is good as conversation is encouraged among players to find the best way to solve the game "puzzle".  With only two players, it is less interesting as the path forward on each turn is more obvious.

I really like this game but I think it highly depends on the people you play it with. Some people seem to like if others tell them what to do - I don't like those sessions. I like it when all 4 players are involved and high fiving each other after getting rid of an infection.

cool Co-op game, I just barely beat it in hard mode, not going to try legendary, coz i know i need a lot of luck for that.

Suffers from quarterbacking, but since im the owner, i tend to not let one ppl do the thinking, its a great brainstorming game, also loved to teach this to kids, so they can learn to do teamwork.

maybe can get a bit repetitive after 10 games.

Absolutely great game, very accessible. Together with Ticket To Ride, San Juan, Smallworld, 7 Wonders and Dominion VERY suitable as gateway game or game to play with non-gamers. Just make sure the most experienced player shuts up - as else he'll be running the whole game by himself. 

REMINDER TO ALL VETERANS:
Accept you might lose if you see others mess up. 
Pandemic excitement is also in learning how to win!
Give others that excitement too, don't spoil it for them by running the game on your own.

RATING: 7
It's a fun, easy to play game that can be fairly punishing, as co-op games ought to be. However the curve isn't quite steep enough for my friends and I, and the theme doesn't click anywhere near as well as Ghost Stories which I prefer. It's a fantastic theme for a co-operative game and the infection mechanic (in particular the repetitive infection of the same cities over the course of the game) has it's heart in the right place. It just doesn't quite crack my top tier of games. It feels a bit too light for my personal tastes, which I recognize is exactly what makes it work for a lot of players especially infrequent gamers who still want a reasonable challenge without much complexity.

This is really Pandemic's strong suit: the game is incredibly simple to pick up and play, but you can get a lot out of that simplicity. It has a narrative that directs players more than most "abstract" games, but isn't very much divorced from that genre in terms of mechanics and presentation aside from the luck aspect.

Highly recommended for fans of co-op games, however, especially if you've tried Ghost Stories and found it too punishing.

Really incredible game design, building on an extremely simple foundation, giving a wide array of options for tactics by combining the special skills of each role.
I especially like how all the cards are basically just a city, and a color based on the same city, yet they play such a big part of any strategy. Will you play your card to travel to or from the city, build there, or trading it to your fellow player? You can only do one!
Fun, quick to set up and play, and terribly exciting.

A little less than thrilled if I had to play this again, hence the 5 rating. It seems to boil down to one person who figures it out telling everyone else how to play it; which totally destroys the theme to me. While the mechanics seem quite different, they dont really convey the theme to me at all. THe idea of cracking a virus code has got to be more about hypothesis, and not about making melds. Same with the roles, they dont convey the theme. There needs to be the psychology of leadership, the psychology of mass panic and the puzzle of biology if this theme is to work. As is, the game pretty much upsets me as it falls flat in all these levels. It's not bad game at all for the right group and probably deserves its rating. But not for me.

Only two plays so far - rating may go up after more. Generally fun, but I'm not thrilled with the devestating effects from two consecutive bad card draws (on both games!).

This is a VERY good co-operative game. I've played this a few times with gamer friends and many times solo. Obviously it is better when played with others and I have found that the the group feeling has been one of real tension and a deep emersion in the saving of the world from the deadly diseases! A collective "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrgh!" when we lose and high fives and "yea hars!" all-round when we "save the world" speaks volumes for how this game sucks you in. I love it and look forward to playing it every time. Good playing time and nice streamlined play. Thanks to my mum & dad who bought me this for my bday! (25/8/08)

Pandemic is a fun, cooperative game. Although there is a play count it’s actually somewhat irrelevant. You can play a game on your own or with any number of people as the decisions are ultimately all collective. This makes a great party game as everyone can get involved.

Played 2x 2-player games: fun! Very simple game with surprising depth for such a short game. The player roles are all not only useful but crucial; once the players have their roles, a strategy must be tailored to which roles are in play. Much of the game is about balance; maintaining a low risk of "outbreak" without detracting from the goal of curing the diseases.

This is the game that got me into the board gaming hobby. Excellent co-op game, especially with the different roles and the creative take on the "board plays against you" mechanic.

I know this game is widely loved, but I'm not a fan of co-op games if they're highly vulnerable to alpha player problems, and this one does absolutely nothing to counter that.  For me, it's not so much about one player taking over a game, it's about all decisions being made by committee.  It feels like each player is playing every role to some extent when that happens.  As an alpha gamer, I prefer everyone to make the most optimal moves, but I prefer co-ops that include mechanics that preclude 1) one person dictating the entire gameflow and 2) games where most or all decisions are made by committee.  This is a solo game pretending to be multiplayer.

tl;dr: a huge success with good reason

I remember this game being announced. There was NO buzz. I was working for a distributor or Z-Man titles at the time, so I ordered just a couple of cases. I had requested pre-orders from shops, there were very few. The day the games arrived though, the game was sold out. So I contacted Zev to order more. He had sold out. He told me he had printed 3000, a very normal print run at the time. So this game went from no buzz to THE hype of the moment in no time. And it seems to still be growing, with all these variations and expansions coming out.
In any case... I've never been a fan of co-ops. And I probably never will be. I don't hate them, but I just prefer some healthy competition. That being said, I think this is still my favorite co-op (of the ones I've played, duh!). I think it has the perfect balance of amount of rules, play time and complexity for all experience levels. Most co-ops have some variation of the if-this-happens-resolve-this-random-event-card-mechanism. Pandemic kind of has that with the epidemic cards, but other games like [thing=121921][/thing] have way more of that. If feels kind of like a lame way to throw problems at the players to me. But the (sparce) way it is implemented in Pandemic is perfect. There's only a little bit of it, but the tension it creates is great.
Also, this game is pretty streamlined and usually takes less than an hour.
All in all, very good, though not my favorite.

Amazing game.  A very fun, ultra-cooperative game.  There is no way you could play this to compete against another player in your game, and you have to work together--it's kind of a game that plays by committee.

I first played this at a bar with a bunch of work people (we are in emergency management) so I think we get a very inside jokey amount of fun from this that many other players might not.

I'm not sure what to rate this yet.  Played once by myself to test mechanics and once with 3 players.  The 3 player game was messed up, unfortunately because I put the epidemic cards in the wrong spots (bottom of each set).  This made them come up fewer times than they should have.  We ended up winning the easy mode game with only 6 cards left.  I'd love to try this under the standard gameplay rules...or even get murdered by the difficult setup :D

classic cooperative game fighting epidemics on a world map


I'm not sure. I like the basic idea of cooperative game, but in practice it is odd to play against the game.
If a single turn of a card decides the outcome of a game, why not just throw a coin instead? Isn't it too often just a gamble of where the one city card that mustn't come up at that moment is placed in the stack put on top during the last epidemic?

Our first "real" board game outside of the typical Milton Bradley party games. We love it so far. While we have only played it with 4 Epidemic cards so far, it is a very challenging game. My wife enjoys that it is us vs. the game, and not us attacking each other. Very smooth mechanics that allow you to really think out some nice combos. I can see how the game can be susceptible to quarterbacking from a strong personality at the table, but I don't see that as a huge negative. Overall a very good game that feels refined and challenging that will surely bring a lot of replays.

It felt pretty finely balanced the first two times I've played. I think I have a handle on the strategy now...we were able to win a 2 player game pretty handily the third go.  I like it a lot.

Updated from an 8 to a 9, after repeated plays.

It's a nice option if you want to play with non-gamers. Easy to teach, cooperative and adaptable difficulty. However, do avoid the game if there is one person who likes too much to take the leader role. I think this isn't a game design problem... but it is clearly a problem with some groups.

That said, I don't really feel this is a great game for experienced players groups. After some games, all the games seem similar. It's nice if you want to play it from time to time. It isn't a game to play every week with the same people.

1. Wykonanie planszy i znaczników. 
2. Klimat. 
3. Grafiki. 
4. Poziomy trudności. 
5. Zróżnicowani bohaterowie. 
6. Proste zasady. 
7. Poziomy trudności. 

Minusy: 
1. Wykonanie kart (słabe, cienkie, od razu powinny wylądować w koszulkach) 
2. Pionki graczy wyjęte żywcem z chińczyka z lat 90. 

„Pandemia” to świetny tytuł co-op. Dobrze zbalansowany co pozwala się dobrze bawić graczom na różnym poziomie. Gra trzyma w napięciu. Tytuł potrafi wejść w krew jak wirusy z którymi mamy walczyć, i zmusza do ponownych rozgrywek. Polecam i oceniam na 7/10

Difficult. First you think, that this game is very abstract, but the theme is not only past-on.

RATING: 6
A decent accounting game that reminds me of Risk, albeit in reverse. The manipulation of the infection deck is very clever (by this I mean the premature recycling mechanic), and the outbreaks do bring out the theme to some small degree, but overall, it is an ephemeral experience.
It is definitely more fun to play this abstract game as a team than solo, since interactions bring out the game's other mild thematic strength---the special skills of each character.

A really fun yet challenging co-op game where each player has a role which aids them in curing and removing viruses. However, the viruses spread and it becomes more difficult with more players as there is a set time limit.
It's satisfying when you win and this game really bonds a group together. Great theme and amazing components.

Multiplayer puzzle solitaire. The gears of this game are too apparent: I always feel like there's one 'best' move for us to find or miss. 

The system of the game is gorgeous on paper, but I did not enjoy it in practice. I mean, one of the major interactions is a boring metagame conversation about the contents of the infection discard pile.

RATING: 8
There's something quite lovely about the rules for Pandemic, it really captures the feel of the theme well and the mechanics are splendidly streamlined but offer lots of possibilities and great replay value.

To work well the group needs to get into the game and play with hidden hands, the social aspect of co-oping is the edge tat brings this back to the table again and again

RATING: 5.5
My very first Co-op game. Pretty impressed over all. It would probably rank higher, but it's more of a puzzle game for me then a strategy game, meaning that it's pretty obvious what you're supposed to do on every turn for each player. IMO there's not that many choices really, after a couple of play through's, you just "know" what you're supposed to do, and It's just a matter of being able to have enough time to do it. I hear the expansion is a must for this game and fixes some issues that I have with Pandemic, so I'll have to check it out and this game might get ranked higher.

I really, really like Pandemic.  Luckily, we don't have "quarterbacks" when playing and everyone works well together.  However, we don't like the rule that if you run out of city cards, then you have lost.  We felt that if you had enough to possibly win in your hands, and you were keeping the viruses under control, then you should continue play. All in all, a lot of fun and love the theme.

Rather fun in the sense that each turn, players are trying to solve a logic puzzle together, although the player with the most experience tends to dominate the discussion. Love the Epidemic mechanic where the cards in the discard pile are reshuffled and placed BACK ON TOP of the draw pile - it truly reflects the virulent nature of diseased cities.

It's a good game and a lot of people tend to like it. However, it doesn't appeal to me as much as other cooperative games with different themes (Arkham Horror, Space Monster, etc). But, it is very mechanically sound and still a good fun game to play. Also, it's not too complex.

Pandemic is not a bad game, it does co-op extremely well and I would never refuse to play it, but I really feel like there are better games out there like the forbidden games and this one is quite a bit overrated.  Nothing it does seems all that special, it is just a fun all around solid co-op game with a meh theme.  I like it, but I am not putting it on my shelf.

Honestly if it wasn't for all the hype I think this would be between a 7-8 for me but given all the hype I just don't really want to play it that much.

The best co-op game I've played. The epidemic mechanic where past cities get re-infected keeps the short-term goal of cleaning cubes from feeling totally random, giving you an actual sense of planning and purpose, rather than just mindlessly putting out fires as they appear (something I didn't like about Defenders of the Realm and something I fear I won't like about Flash Point: Fire Rescue). Downsides: games swing wildly along the spectrum from fairly easy to impossibly difficult, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction at either end. Also, some of the roles can seem totally useless, especially with a low number of players where you want to get the most out of the limited advantages you have.

10/11/2009: Ok, this is my second 10. With the "On the Brink"-Expansion this it becomes really excellent and gains lots of variety. As an update to my first comment: I actualy like the game best with two players. Especialy with four, there seems to happen too much between player-turns: The world will look completely different the next time it's your turn, so there's little chance to plan ahead.

Pandemic in its original form has a quarterbacking issue. And on top of that, the mechanics are simple enough to solve that it really does just come down to whether you've shuffled the deck into a winning configuration (see also: Solitaire). A lot of the recent expansions look like they've added new mechanics and increased the difficulty of the disease to compensate (or maybe it's the other way around), but honestly I think the core is so weak that I'm not really willing to find out if the rest is better.

RATING: 7
First time I played I walked away thinking winning was all based on luck. Too many car draws to get lucky or unlucky draws with. After reading some tips, I can see how some of this can be planned for, but I still think that luck is going to have a big impact on if you win or lose.

I think the my main issue with the game is that you don't have have many options for actions. Most of the actions are just ways to move. Then there's building research stations, healing people, finding a cure and trading knowledge. Cure is not an option for an action. If you can do it then you do, there's no reason to put it off. Healing people isn't really a decision because there's usually a few cities at 3 that need to be taken care of. So you move and then heal those areas that need it. It's mostly a forced action. Research stations waste cards, so you're really only looking to do that if the role that build them is out of the game. So the only real decision in the game is trading knowledge and IMO that's such an action waster that I would argue that it's best just to heal and draw cards and get the cures if someone gets lucky. We had to waste 3 people's turns to trade enough cards for a cure and that was with efficient planning. One of them was usually the medic so we were losing out on taking a lot of cubes off the board to get the cures. In the meantime we added 6 cubes to the board putting us closer to outbreaks which is how we lost in the end.

I'm wondering how many times people have won this have been either lucky card draws at the beginning of the game or people missing rules that restrict the researcher or sharing knowledge in general.

Very entertaining cooperative game, although it didn't give me the same "buzz" as Knizia's Lord of the Rings. Looking forward to trying it with four players. Rating could go either way with time.

This used to be THE Co-Op game but the base game is showing it's age. The quarterbacking issue where one player orders everyone around can be a big turn off, also some of the mechanics that were originally loved for being simple are just feeling boring now, like set collection and discard of five cards. However the expansions to this game really save it. There is a ton of variety to add to the game for anyone who originally loved it and wanted to refresh it, like myself. Also this game will still be great for new bright eyed board gamers as I'm sure it will feel just as fun to them as it did to all of us who played it when it first came out. I still recommend everyone at least give Pandemic a try and throw in an expansion or two when it starts to feel old.

My favorite co-op game. I enjoy the modern theme. I also enjoy the "purity" of the design. The designer simply lays bare the cooperative element and allows the players to interact together against random card pulls.

To me... this is just Pandemic with permanent expansions. So I am lumping Pandemic with Pandemic: Legacy.

With that said...WOW!

I have got a fever, and the only cure is more cowbell...and a medic,...and a eradication, oh and maybe a new role card and one quiet night and...

Absolutely addicted to this game. Seems like every time we play it comes down to one or two turns from victory and the world explodes! Occasionally, we can squeak out a win just in time. Awesome!

Numerous times I will come home from work and my wife and brother-in-law will have it set up on the table after 2 or 3 plays that day. Hmmm, stupid work! 

The ultimate co-op! We will find new good Co-ops like Flash Point, Ghost Stories, Tiny Epic Defenders, Legendary, Forbidden Island and Desert. However, we always come back to the Granddaddy...Pandemic!!!

RATING: 8
An innovative game that helped pioneer co-ops.  I like trying to optimize each of the character's roles and decisions.  I don't like losing because the deck runs out.  A very good game, but it has turned into a dry exercise in probably after about 10 plays.  But, I guess that's longer than most games.  The expansion is excellent and adds a lot of replay value.  This is the best game since Risk for teaching people world geography :P

This game can be an "8" - if you don't play with an "A-Type" personality who is telling each and every other player how they should play their turn.  If you have that type of a person at the table then this game rates as a "3".

Pandemic probably gets the most play in the household, either 2P or with friends.  Also good to fit into a lunchtime session (where it caused an epidemic and some colleagues also bought it for home).

This game is a lovely coop and I think the rating may go up. I don't think that every game is solvable - certainly not at higher difficulties, and this has sometimes bothered me a bit - but I am not sure if that really should bother me, so long as it is still possible to improve the odds of winning by clever play. And it certainly is a game of skill in that sense.

Fun game, but can end up being a very frustrating game since usually only 1 or 2 players with end up being the alpha "meta" strategist and try to dominate everyone else's actions. I like the Legacy version way better, but haven't played with any of the expansions for this version.

Another game that didn't grab me as much as the rest of our group, though only because I've never been much of a fan of co-op games. The game was improved slightly by the bio-terrorist expansion, but still won't feature on a list of my favourite games any time soon.

Very good co-op. All the roles are good and it is vital that you all work as a team. There are so many little highs along the way to victory - and therefore an awful gaping chasm if you blow it! Very emotional!

Update: as I play more co-ops I realise that actually this is the type that I like least as it has the puzzle co-op downfall that I dislike - unless every one of you knows the game well, it is vital that anyone inexperienced does as they are told, as one false step can bring the whole thing crashing down. It then has to be a case of the newbie(s) having every single move orchestrated for them for the 1st game or two.And I was taught the game by one of the nicest, patient gamers I have ever met - I really can't imagine what it would be like being instructed by a games tyrant or bully!

Brilliant co-op with a rich theme, interesting choices, and a lot of challenge. I particularly love that you can adjust the difficulty with epidemic cards; we always won on the easy level, but have yet to win on heroic mode. There's definitely an imbalance in roles; for instance, the medic is nearly invaluable especially if you're playing on one of the higher difficulties. Still, the intensify and outbreak mechanics allow for extremely intense gameplay and all players stay invested and engaged throughout, so there's never any boredom. Overall, just a really cool game.

RATING: 6
A very compelling cooperative game that plays quickly and is consistently tense. The only thing that keeps this from ranking even higher are some minor fiddly aspects to the card and cube distribution. Overall, this is probably one the best cooperative game out there and representative of the new wave of cooperative titles (including Ghost Stories and Battlestar Galactica) that blow away the old generation (including Lord of the Rings and Shadows Over Camelot). Edit: Game has felt more abstract and dry to me as time marches on ... game doesn't hit the table and rating lowered to 6.

RATING: 8
Really good, probably best short co-op game. Its very important that when you play this you let people that are learning in on more of the decision making. If you take over and tell them what to do, its not fun and they don't learn. There is a real since of panic when diseases spread and its just a fun game.

Somehow this game fails to induce the fervor other games do in my group (wife+daughter).
We play "serious" games like Agricola,PR less serious like Carc, TtR and I thought being able to play with each other rather than against would increase fun and replayability.
After 4-5 games this is still jsut a tad over "meh".
Will give it a few more tries, though.

Pandemic is not so much a game as a Rubick's cube:  the entertainment comes in being beaten by it, over and over again.  This is a snappy, fun cooperative that is almost clinical (pardon the pun) in its efficiency.  It's susceptible to quarterbacking, where one player tries to take over and direct the others.  Easy to learn, hard to beat.

I see now, why it was so easy for us to defeat the game. We made one of the common mistakes. But I expicitly asked whether I'd have to get rid of my cards exceeding 7 right away or after my turn. The way we played it I was able to find the antidote for two diseases in one turn (playing the scientist) Good components, awesome because truely different theme - hey, it's mankind which is on the brink of extinction so you better get yourself together, a lot of interaction. I want this and I want to play it again. Badly! 

Have played it several times now and the fun/time/theme-ratio of this game is one of the best among all games I've yet seen. It takes about 45 minutes to play, 15 minutes to teach and it's a very tense experience. 

Today we played the supermegaheroic level of the game. We intended to play with 5 cards, cause we couldn't find the sixth epidemic card, so I figured it was lost. We build 5 stacks and gamed on, but the sixth card was still in the player cards pile ... Man, did we lose, because of drawing 3 epidemic cards almost in a row.

There are many games I like better than this one but it plays fast and is different.

1st pl: There is more randomness in the game than I wished for. Simple rules. The mechanics was lower than average. Plays fast. Low downtime. I thought the theme was weak. You just remove cubes on a map. Fun factor was not so high. But the game played pretty tight so I hope we will get "into" it after a few plays.

2nd pl: Lost again. Damn it! Took one hour. My gaming group thought the game was acceptable. "Looks like Risk but is better game" :/

Fortunately with one expansion out and at least one more on the way I feel that by the time it gets a little 'old' I will have a few options for making the gameplay more fresh.

After playing it the third time, on the heroic difficulty level, I have to give this game high marks.  The harder the game gets, the more enjoyable it seems to be.  Terrific interaction along with very good tension make a powerful combination, putting this game in a very elite "fun" category.  

UPDATE:  After a handful of additional plays, I can see Pandemic drifting into that "have to be in the right mood to play" category.  Meaning that I am not really all that compelled to suggest it most of the time.  Good game, just fading a bit.

Settlers of Catan and King of Tokyo peaked my interest in the hobby, but Pandemic sealed it.  I had never even heard of co-op board games before, much less played one, so this thing blew my mind.  And even after playing so many other games, this one still holds up.  It sounds crazy, but the thing I love most is the feeling of dread this game gives.  "Will there be an outbreak in San Francisco?  Can we avoid clearing out blue cubes for just one more turn?"  And with how difficult the game can be, it still always feels like we have a chance at winning.  I've introduced many friends to board gaming with Pandemic, and even my non-gamer friends like it.  Perfect 10!

05/01/2012 - Played the game with less discussion about every little move and it went much better. Increasing my rating to a 6 for now, might improve further with more plays.

Update: This game has finally grown on me. For us, it usually comes down to the final turn and we try to plan out how each person should move in order for us to stop the diseases. This can be tense and it makes for some great "a-ha!" moments when you realize that you can in fact win the game on that final turn.

I'm lucky that most of my plays have been with the same group so when we play it's a blast.  It does feel like you are on a team and competing against the game.  Solid designed game.

Great idea for a game and some interesting mechanics but also fundamentally flawed, imo. Bad luck with the way cards come out can leave you literally helpless. It'd be ok if that happened very occasionally but it happens too frequently for my liking. Sometimes the game can be fun but sadly it's probably more often just frustrating or even irritating.

Great cooperative action. I love this game. The beauty of it is that you are trying to beat the board and it usually wins. Not to the point of ad nauseam but just enough to invoke a challenge. This game is one that I am eager to play multiple times in a row.

RATING: 8
Tense and Exiting. Takes a satisfying amount of thought. It has quite a bit of replayability. It also has many, many stratagies that can be taken. My main complaint is that the winning of the game is a bit of a letdown. Its just like "Oh. Ok we won. cool." But I think its the nature of the game since you can see it coming for a few turns away usually.

I never really saw the appeal of Pandemic, but now that I've played it, I get it.  This game is a lot of fun, and a serious challenge.  Our first game, we literally won within a single turn of losing; we were out of cards in the player deck, and were able to finish as the last player finished his turn.  It's a frantic co-op scramble to save the world from disease, and we all really enjoyed it.

Thematically this is great. There is a lot of tension late in the game, as I'm really, really hoping the next player card isn't an epidemic. That said, I'm not sure about coop games, as it's easy for 1-player to dictate everyone else's move. I might try a variant from the forums that limits conversation to players in the same city or if they spend a card in one of the two cities between players.

RATING: 4
It's not a BAD game - it's actually pretty ingeniously designed - it's just that it gets boring after just a few plays. We did finally manage to luck out and beat the hardest difficulty once, but only once. And that's also a problem with it. Once you figure out the basic strategy to win with, you generally only lose on the hardest difficulty, which is just chock full of way-too-rapid explosion of the situation.

For the most part, the game is a logic puzzle, with some gambling, but at the highest difficulty level, you're unlikely to even make it back to your turn before there's another outbreak, because there just aren't enough cards in the deck to give you a chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Whether you win or lose seems to be more determined by the fall of the cards rather than the strategy of the players. Initial rating of 5.

Pandemic is a great game, and being a cooperative game makes it a perfect game for playing with friends that aren't too into gaming.

My low rating comes from its playtime in my collection. I like it, and I will bring it with me sometimes, but I would prefer other games most of the time. I suppose, it just gets old, even with the expansion.

I only played it after having The Cure and playing that a few times and the "big" Pandemic feels much too clunky to me. The Cure is much faster, of course. But there is something feeling overly repetitive to me with the big game somehow. Not too sure I want to play it that often, but would still be willing to play with the right group.

+ Variable player powers gives the players some differentiation.

Cool theme, but extremely thin.

- More puzzle than game; playing feels like working a Sudoku with extra fiddlyness.

Absolutely average feeling game. There's no real tension due to the co-op nature. Sometimes we "won", sometimes the cards flipped out in an unlucky order and we "lost" - either way we were bored. Traded this one away.

I have about 15 plays or more on this game, and I still feel like I haven't figured it out. High replay value. Really want On The Brink soon!

Edit: 40 plays later, and it's only started to get a little bit stale. Maybe that's because I played it ten times in the past week... :D

Edit 2: Over 150 plays later, owning On The Brink, and I can say this is one of the most brilliant games I have played to date. :)

RATING: 9.5
I played this once way back '07, then didn't play it again until seven years later. I wish I hadn't wasted those 7 years. I think this game does nearly everything right.

1) It looks good.
2) It accepts a pretty wide number of players and scales well through them all. Including solo!
3) The game is infinitely tweak-able to suit the challenge your looking for. The expansions only enhance this.
4) The theme is both unique and engaging.
5) It is accessible to many levels of gamers and non-gamers. Some of this is due to the theme. Some due to the tweakability mentioned above. Some due to a fairly simple rules set. Some is due to it being a co-op (it is less scary for some than competitive and you more experienced players can help you learn to play while you play).
6) It is well supported by quality expansions.
7) It has fun gameplay that is well integrated with its theme.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1.25

Pandemic was definitely my introduction to great modern games.

I love the feeling that you're continuously one turn away from losing the game, especially in the bio-terrorist mode where you can see the outbreak coming and do a last ditch flight to the problem area before the terrorist destroys the city and ends the game.

It needs to be played with analytic people who aren't overbearing which can be a difficult to find combination in people but it's a wonderful game with the right players.

RATING: 5
The more  I play Pandemic, the less I like it.  I've concluded that it works best as a solo game, or as a two-player game, but only if those 2 people are close, with similar intelligence and experience. Every time I've seen it played, there are some people giving orders, and others that are just doing what they're told.  The people that are just listlessly moving their pawn around, following instructions, might as well not even be there.  What augments this problem, is the fact that the game has such a razor-thin margin for error, even at the beginning difficulty, that the team has to behave this way.  There's no room for an inexperienced player to do what he wants, or attempt to try different strategies.  If not for the interesting theme and epidemic mechanisms, this game would completely blow.

RATING: 8
The first co-op game I've ever played and it was kind of a revelation for me. I got this based on theme alone and ended up figuring out that it was also a great (and in someways ground-breaking) game. 

Nuclear weapons, pandemics, and wars... those are my macabre, academic fascinations. If it's themed after one of the horsemen of the apocalypse, chances the game will have my interest.

As much as I like this game, something feels missing. I wish the diseases had more character and individual traits. I wish more of a real epidemiological feel (an R0 value? immunity? etc) were involved in a more robust way. Now, if only someone would make a heavier, more simulation-style pandemic game (like Plague Inc for iOS)! 

I need to grab some expansions at some point. Also really looking forward to playing Pandemic Legacy
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like the co-op aspect for family play - and the little ones really enjoy it - though they are really just playing along with mom and dad, rather than 'playing' the game with their own actions.  As an adult strategy and group effort game, its an engaging and exciting trip, and the chain reactions can get out of hand fast! (Sometimes too fast!).

Really something - though the rules are a little phrenetic with everything going on.  Once we got the basics - there were a few situations that really got us tangled up until they were clear. (Cured diseases allow full city treatment rather than one block, cures requiring a research station for example.) Take the time to do a FULL readthrough of the rules before play - and it should be clear as milk when infection starts to spread. ;)

By far my favorite game (in my short collection). The mechanics is just brilliant, especially the epidemic cards' happenings.

Fantastic cooperative game that still seems hard to win at the introductory level after 9 plays.  Great tension throughout.  Even when we think we have everything under control, a new outbreak or epidemic can throw a serious wrench in our plans.  Plays great with young and old, it's popular with my nine-year-old, my high school students and my game group.  As I imagine is the case with most cooperatives, it can lose its fun if one player dominates the discussion of choices and tries to play the game as a multi-character solitaire.

UPDATE: After completing the full year of [gameid=161936], I'm not sure when this will ever get back to the table.  I suppose it still will have a place as a gateway game for the non-competitive, I just don't currently have a lot of opportunity to scratch that itch.

Highly recommended. This game will convert any new gamer into a board game enthusiast. Pandemic is a highly strategic co-op game with a theme that everyone can get into.

One of the Titans, Pandemic is the face of the collaborative play subgenre.

This plays very much like Forbidden Island. In fact, if you aren't sure about the rules in one you'd probably be correct to apply assumptions based on rules from the other. The theme works well with the game - it feels like Forbidden Island meets Rattus. Gameplay moves fast. Even when the group loses, the game is fun and engaging. I might have ranked this higher if I were more into coops, but I do appreciate the advantages games like this bring for family play. I will be keeping an eye out for purchasing this one.

Easy to teach and learn, but this isn't a very good cooperative game. Too much dictating by players who know it all, board is clumsy and small, and the theme isn't pleasant.

Break the Safe is still my favorite of the cooperative games.

This game is tons of fun.   I've played at least 3 dozen games now with my wife.  It's simple to learn, and has a good amount of strategy involved.  At the end of each game, we always reflect on things we could have done differently.     

The theme is also great.   You really get a feel for infection spreading, and we always make references to "outbreak" the movie while playing.  It's got a permanent place on the "to play" shelf.

This is not a good game for someone looking for complexity and obfuscated gameplay.  But if you're just looking to have fun, there's much to be had.

Too easy to assess the best course of action in my opinion, making it a better solitaire experience.
Difficulty of the entire game is too strongly tied to the initial shuffle. Most times I play I feel zero stress as I am casually sweeping up the mess on the board. Maybe I don't play enough, but I feel that the initial shuffle tends to yield difficult to lose games most often.
Great gateway game though (teaches limited action selection, planning ahead, cooperation, risk-assessment, etc.). 
I prefer Forbidden Island.

RATING: 8
A model co-op. 

Advantages:
- Strong theme well connected to the mechanics.
- It's hard to beat, impossible if you do not cooperate well. Still, variable difficulty welcomes newcomers.
- Keeps you in agony for its entire duration

Disadvantages:
- It's a classic co-op that can suffer from the Alpha Player problem.

I've overplayed this game, and as a result I'm less keen on playing it more. My rating has fallen from 9 to 8 but hey, it stood hundreds of games before that!

RATING: 8.5
Fantastic multiplayer co-op game.  Great for gamers that like strategy and are familiar with co-op strategy games.  Very challenging game but great fun.  If you're new to hobby games I would recommend getting Forbidden Island first but once you've mastered that go for Pandemic.

RATING: 6.6
A smart design. Perfect to introduce someone to the cooperative games. Give tension, interesting choices to make, stuff to calculate.
My vote is not that high cause i easily get bored about this. Could start to become mere math calculations, with a bit of luck that sometimes you can do nothing about.
Lacks of replayability, and after a bit easily starts to get repetitive. Unless you really get into it and want to beat it time and time again. 
Sold cause Legacy was coming in, probably would have sold anyway.

RATING: 7
I brought this game as a casual, gateway game for friends and family. I don't think this game is good for that purpose however, as all the times I've tried this with friends and family not into board games, I found they mostly let me make all the decisions. It's also pretty hard, even on the easiest difficulty.

That said, as a coop experience this game is good with more experienced board gamers. The fun often comes from the discussions of plans as you try and eliminate the viruses before they go pandemic. With the right group of people, the discussions over game plans, who needs to be where and when to use the character abilities is where this game is at it's best.

The game can get repetitive over multiple sessions, but I imagine the various expansions probably help with this. I only own the base game however, so can't comment on the expansions.

It's overall a solid coop game, but definitely not a gateway game. For more experienced board gamers only.

I own this version and the legacy version, and I have to say the legacy version is significantly better in terms of twists and turns and content. But the problem with the more awesome legacy version is that it takes at least 15+ hours to play in totality. So if you get this version I recommend you get the expansions in order to add the features of the legacy but without all the time commitment.

RATING: 10
What I like:

-Short playing time but it doesn't sacrifice anything to get it
-Massive tension. It is very rare that I'm cheering so much for a single card draw as I am in this
-Very interesting and vastly different roles creating unique situations
-Value for money
-Works with so many groups and a totally awesome theme that almost everyone can get behind
-allows great strategic thinking  because of the discard pile you have a good idea of what you need to do and can prioritize accordingly. 

What I dislike: 
It is possible to have a bit of the alpha-gamer case with this one, as almost all information is shared if success is to be acheived. Especially if the level of experience varies between players. I found that this game works best if everyone wants to participate mostly equally in the discussion of every turn.

RATING: 8
Nice difficulty level.  I am sure it will suffer the co-op fade over time.  I think I can get enough plays out of it to make it fun regardless.  Though, now that I think of it, good co-ops should suffer from the fade with increased play because it means skill is an integral part of the game. If it didn't have that fade, it would be too luck based and random to be worthwhile.  So I think this is my official go to co-op and when it starts getting stale..... there is always the expansion.

Still holding my interest after 30 plays, something I didn't think a co-op could do.  Rating changed upward.

On the Brink adds some variety, and I will use it going forward.  Its not the quite the life injector I had hoped it would be, but its still a must add.

RATING: 5
1st game...well we decided to play the 'easy' route and owner of game set it up and we ran through it.  We won.  I'm usually not happy about a co-op game that can be beaten in the first play when you don't know the system well and probably are making some extra moves that don't need to be made. Well as it turns out we seeded the deck wrong...and actually had an "Ultra-easy" game on our hands as we played without 2 epidemic cards.  

Now for the game play. I love it.  You feel a real sense of urgency in this game it feels so important to get so much done in such a little amount of time.  This can be a brutal game if we'd have had even one of the extra epidemics in there I think we'd have lost.  Fun game very intense. 

I do feel this is one of those "expansions in mind" games and won't be surprised if we see an expansion for it sooner rather than later. 

UPDATE: Played it twice more both times this time we are on "Heroic"...I'm still at 66% win ratio.

I was very skeptical of this game going in because of disappointing experiences with cooperative games in the past and the first play didn't really do much for me, but I've since had a chance to play it a few times, and I must say that it's really growing on me.  I'm considering buying a copy now so I can keep playing it more.  I'm not quite sure what it is about Pandemic that I enjoy, but I do know that I keep thinking about the game and revisiting it in my head, so it's probably worth picking up.  It's so very quick and packs a lot into a short amount of time, and it's so very brutal and difficult that it makes you want to try again and again.  The mechanics of the epidemics and intensifying just seem to work so well together that it really achieves the simplicity yet depth that I look for in games.

On the fence about this one.  Game play is great but I'll admit this leads to me kind of being the alpha leader on dictating strategy and having everyone else execute the plan.  Our game group has a hard time with collaboration on this one since 2 of us kind of vie for alpha leader.

I don't like particularly cooperative games, that is why the low score. Now with respect to cooperative games, this one has nice components, simple rules, and clever game mechanics (I really liked how the epidemics are resolved and influence the long term game play). But it has the usual problems of cooperative games (there maybe someone that will try to tell you how to play). Shadows Over Camelot is better for my taste of games with respect to these kind of games. Battlestar Galactica is the best. Still Pandemic is a Family favourite!

A fun co-op game that plays quickly and has some neat dynamics to it.

As I anticipated, the replay of this title has dropped a bit for me.  The game seems to play itself a bit too much, with player responses somewhat pre-destined by the crisis at hand.

While I like the fact that you have to work together to get it done, Pandemic doesn't offer enough choice in HOW to get it done.  At the end of the day, it feels more like a puzzle than a game to me.

The big brother for Forbidden Island.

It is also a pretty good cooperative game. The gameplay, though suffering a little with the fiddling with the cubes, is fast and smart, making the whole experience well worth it.

It is difficult without being hellish and true cooperation is a must to win. Pandemic can, however, be affect by the "follow my lead" - when one or two players, normally the veterans in the game, conduct the others. But this is not a problem of Pandemic, being something to look out in most of the co-ops. So, be aware to avoid this!

Anyway, a fine game. Enjoy!

Compared to Ghost Stories the spatial considerations seem much deeper. I think I like it.

The opportunity cost of getting specific cards from one player to another seems awfully high. Found the logistics of this a little irritating as it didn't feel very productive overall.

...Seem to frequently lose by running out of cards to draw, which I find dissatisfying because it just means an arbitrary time limit elapsed, not that the state on the board is particularly dire.

...I respect this design enough that I probably won't lower the rating below 7, but I'm getting pretty frustrated with the situation that we think we're close to winning but then we run out of cards to draw. I don't think we have ever won since correcting a rule misunderstanding.

Pros:
quick playing game
easy to understand
challenging and the difficulty is able to be adjusted

Cons:

- Winning doesn't give you as good a sense of accomplishment as you'd receive when defeating a human opponent
- Being a co-op game this game can end up with one person telling everyone else what to do

Wow! People complain about it getting repetitive, but I just can't see it. This game has more 'theme' than you can ever wish for. It varies more than you would ever expect. It has you discussing World Health for hours afterward. And it puts Essen on a world map. Simply: Wow.

Thoughts after first game : Artwork is fine, gameboard looks cool. Quality of the cards is very poor, most of cards were bend. 

It was fun to play, game took about 20-30 minutes. I really like the "save the world" theme.

Addictive game. Definitely my wife's favorite new game in a long time, and since it plays so well with two it has quickly jumped towards the top of my most played list in a very short amount of time. Maybe 3 other games in my game playing career have been played so often so quickly (Lost Cities, Settlers, Race for the Galaxy). However, while it is a very good game, I can't bring myself to call it one of my own faves. I keep fearing I'm playing it wrong because I have beaten it all but once out of almost 10 times, including a couple on "Heroic"...not only winning them but winning most of them without as much tension as I would like. I want to feel like I barely eak out a win. Still, there are times the game is gloriously nail-biting, and the mechanics are very cool and the theme sounds a bit strange but it's uniqueness and "real world setting" make it really stand out as a winner.

A beautifully designed cooperative game that kind of fell flat for me.  There isn't anything wrong with the game per se, I just don't get the same satisfaction from winning or losing that I do from other games.

This is simply the perfect co-op game for me. The tension is always there because even if are doing well, the game can turn quickly if the wrong combination of cards turn up. The decision-making can be gut-wrenching. Do I go over there and treat disease or go over here to share information for the cure, hoping an epidemic doesn't happen this turn? The theme is great, and it's simple enough to teach to non-gamers. I never get bored of this game.

wife/gateway-friendly. Pandemic was fun and such a cool mechanic when it came out. Loved it! But more and more often over time, when reaching for Pandemic, I find myself steering the group to Forbidden Island: simpler, faster, more fun, much smaller to haul around, not to mention the metal tin is much more tolerant of abuse.
We enjoy Forbidden Island, and I traded away Defenders of the Realm. So as long as FI does the mechanic better for me, I went ahead and traded off the original 'Pandemic-mechanic' game.
Traded away in exchange for Tales of the Arabian Nights.

Like the co-op part, where you discuss what to do next, as long nobody start to "take control" & decide what you have to do.
Played a few games solo. With several characters, like a "normal" game, but you control them all (duh). There seems to be other versions in the file-section to play solo, have to try it.
It was fun to play solo. Only negative: set up solo and when game was finished ... yea. :D

The first taste into modern board gaming. I had no clue games like this existed. This was my gateway game and it is well worth it's rating. I recommend getting the On the Brink expansion for the petri dish holders for your disease cubes. The only reason I didnt give it higher rating is because of some artistic choices. The cities could be bigger to allow for all the cubes/players to be on at one time while still reading it easily as well as better lines for the movements and colors on the cards dont quite match up with the board/cubes. Makes it confusing for new players sometimes.

I love the artwork and theme. Overall great game.

- The cards seems to me too thin and poor quality. I decided to sleeve mine after just a few games.

- There's a lot of work in the way you have to shuffle the cards during setup. Considering that in the end you only need two deck piles.

Pandemic can be a lot of fun. Sometimes it can be way to hard and sometimes way to easy, but over time, and with the expansion, my wife and I have figured out how to properly balance the game so that it's typically good and challenging and not swayed too far in either direction of difficulty. It's awesome that the game is co-op and fun. It's best played where everybody has good strategies. The fun factor can fail if one person makes or pushes all of their opinions, but that's probably true for any co-op game.

One of my favorite movies is "outbreak."  Naturally, this is a fantastic co-op game for me.  You are part of the CDC and trying to cure, eradicate, and treat diseases that are popping up all over the world.  While I do feel that flipping the infection cards is a little redundant, if you have someone work the cards and know the locations to get it done quickly, it flows very nicely.  Everytime an outbreak happens the whole table always says "ohhh,,noo!"  Everyone seems to get into the game.  It is easy to understand and move around and get things done so new people can feel at ease playing it.

We finally got our own copy of this and have been playing it a lot thanksgiving weekend with great pleasure! It *is* a sort of team verison of solitaite -- and, unlike most competitive games, you can play it very well by yourself, since the players are not in competition. On the other hand, it is definitely even better with a team of people, trying to collectively decide on a strategy to merge their individual role-skills and cards most effectively as the menace grows ever larger. 

The theme is great and very nicely captured by the simple game mechanic. With the 3 player game (which is what we've played the most), the game seems very different each time depending on which 3 roles we use and how the cards turn out.

Obviously a masterpiece design. Some friends HAVE to play at least one session when they come over--cool.

Added later: Well, yes and no. It's a masterpiece design, that much was true, but those friends now request other games when they come over. Pandemic might be slipping a little bit in my personal list of preferences, partly just because it's a co-op. I think it's good with constantly-changing gaming partners, but when you play with the same one or two or three people all the time, I think I prefer the history that builds up in competitive games. Still, brilliant game, obviously.

While I do wonder about longevity, this is a good looking game, and almost anyone can join in and feel comfortable from the start. The lack of competition helps this, of course. This is a cooperative game that doesn't require your being comfortable with obscure mythos, sci-fi (Battlestar Galactica), zombies or gnomes. It has a theme that ordinary people at least understand. 

It is also not so complex that new players need to be told what to do all the time, without their understanding what it is that they are doing, or why they should be doing it. I love Arkham Horror, but suggesting that your sweet aunt Mathilda fight the Dimensional Shambler (not even going into the bonuses she receives for having a +6 Sword of Smiting) while you go through a gate to another world is quite different to suggesting that she catch a shuttle flight to Sydney to cure the red disease. Yes, I know, I shouldn't be playing Arkham Horror with aunt Mathila in the first place, but Pandemic allows you to play with (almost) anyone, with a fair chance that they actually enjoy themselves. That makes it a must have in my collection.

You are specialists at the CDC/Atlanta where you watch several virulent diseases break out simultaneously all over the world. The team mission is to prevent a worldwide pandemic outbreak, treating hot spots while researching cures for each of the four plagues before they get out of hand.

Players must plan their strategy to mesh their specialists' strengths before the diseases overwhelm the world. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. But the diseases are breaking out fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while developing cures. If disease spreads uncontrolled, the players all lose. If they can cure all four diseases, they win.

Pandemic is a cooperative game that doesn't relent. You and your medical team are assigned roles and thrust into a world with rampaging virii. Just when you think you have the upper hand an outbreak occurs infecting and possible reinfecting cities. Then the cards are shuffled and placed back on the draw pile. That's right, those cities are going to be visited by the virus threat again. I like how each person has a unique role. Teamwork is critical to success. Your actions have meaningful consequences to the game. It is up to all of you. Have fun and best luck!

I like this much better than, say, Arkham Horror-- there's a lot more tension and the way the roles interact is neat. Best of all, when I go to a city to do something, it happens; in games like AH, I roll a die to see if it happens.  I get much more enjoyment out of this kind of randomness-- and the "back-on-top-of-the-deck" mechanic controls that randomness, makes it more purposeful.  Very elegant game that I'm digging so far.

Good:

Bad:

-Some role powers aren't intuitive 
-When to use travel cards can be confusing
-Not a gateway game
-Players always start in Atlanta

Overall:
You're trying to save the world by solving a puzzle with your friends and this core experience is what makes you want to play it over an over.  The mechanics really unifies players in an us verse the game mentality.  In full disclosure, the alpha player issue became a big obstacle in my group and forced us to make a house rule that non-active player can only advise if the active player asks them a question.

Hmmm...I'm having doubts about Pandemic...
Don't get me wrong, I loved the game when we played it...And I'll keep on wanting to play the game, until we win (I'm a bad loser ;-)

The thing is that I feel that once you "win" the game I reckon I will get tired of it instantly...It's sort of breaking a code that opens a lock or something. Once it's open, it's open...why close it and try again??

I must admit that I'm one of those guys that (almost) never replays a videogame after I've beaten it (shame on me) and Pandemic feels the same...

Seems to be ground zero for modern cooperative games.  Solid rules and an innovative theme captures first time players.  Most really enjoy it.  Watch out for the bossy types, they can take over more timid personalities.  It does lose some appeal after a while and feels more like a puzzle.  So...don't play it too often and enjoy for years to come.

Too bad the looks of this game are a bit too abstract, because what lies underneath is a great game. It is surprisingly fast and tense, easy to explain and with very little downtime (especially for a co-op!). We can easily squeeze multiple sessions in on a regular gaming night. Best of its kind, even a little bit better than Ghost Stories and Forbidden Island (which I also like very much). Could be due to the fact that it requires more planning (to get the right cards to the right person for example).
Only drawback for me, is that it is still a co-op game. As such, I feel its replayability is limited by default.

Pandemic is good co-op game, not great. Good. Co-op games are generally quite difficult to balance, but Pandemic seems like well-integrated, light family game. I like it that it goes quick, with two players, it seems like an easy job. But certain role combos are much easier to play than others. The jury is still out there. I need more plays to form a better judgment.  So far, I give it a 7.5 based on two plays. 

Updated: It is definitely really tightly balanced. Thus far, the two player games have been excellent with loads of tension. Best mechanic in the game is the epidemic reshuffling of the discard pile back into the deck. Without this mechanism, there would not be enough tension in the game.

Small rule mistakes make a difference to this tight co-op game.

When you think you're doing great job with stoping pandemic, the game punches you in the face, and basically, destroying everything you've done so far. Cooperation, and synergy between players is required to win in this game.

Pandemic is a smart cooperative game.  I'm surprised at how a board game with multiple ways to lose can actually be satisfying and tense (in a good way).

My main concern with this game is that experienced players tend to dominate less experienced/meek players when it comes to group strategy.

Some weird things happened to us in this game. We played this we three players six times so far. 

First three times were relatively easy wins. Is this game perhaps too easy? The fourth time we played too slowly and only won on the last possible action of the last player before we would have lost (for lack of cards to draw). Pfff... close one! Game finaly teaching us a lesson?

Hilariously, we then played our fifth time, all three of us drawing an Epidemy on our first turn, so that at the end of the first round... all having played just once... it was game over already, since we ran into our eighth Outbreak... (with more Outbreaks actually coming in, had the game not ended there). Ouch! So unfair! Was this a case of exceptionally bad RNG? Wondering how rare this occurence really is, it would seem bound to happen every now and then... Game six we then won as we had done the first three times.

Having hit both the highest (game 4) and the lowest (game 5) possible, back to back, I still rate this game not higher than I do, since coop games just don't satisfy my competitive needs.

This game is cool/fun.  The concept is great.  The epidemic or outbreak cards (can't remember which is the name), are awesome and the chain reaction processes are really neat.  Just falls into the smartest/loudest player in the room often dominates.

Pretty cool co-op game. It is kind of abstract in its theme though. There isn't really a lot to look at, which kind of makes it feel like you are cooperatively solving a puzzle, or a math problem.

RATING: 8
I love this game. Thus far it's my most played game. I will mention though the amount you enjoy this game can clearly be determined by who you play it with. It is a "co-operative" game. If you play with someone who has to have their way then you probably won't enjoy this game as much. Mind you the same could probably be said with most co-operative games.

Love the cooperative aspect, which makes this much different than other games, as well as appealing to a more noncompetitive audience as well as gamers.

RATING: 6.5
This game is too much of a puzzle and not enough of a game for me. It was fun a few times.

If you know the game and you're playing with people who don't, there is no right thing to do. You can tell them what to do, which means they're not really playing, or you can leave them to their own devices and watch as you all lose.

I also feel like once you've got the roles figured out, it's very easy to tell early on whether you're going to win or lose, and if you're going to lose, exactly how and why.

I've heard that the expansions fix many of the problems, but I want a game that is solid out of the box. I don't mind expansions enhancing the game, but they shouldn't have to fix it.

I know lots of people love this one. We gave our copy to some friends who did.

Nice co-op game, however there's a catch: The group could be overshadowed by the one person that proposes/insists on the best/optimal strategy (effectively making it a solo game). The expansion (presumably) solves this problem, because it introduces the traitor mechanic (so the easy-going "sharing information" thing, is restricted).

RATING: 8
Very impressive cooperative game. A set collection game at it's heart (the only way to win is to complete a set of each of the four colours - however one player must have all five (or four) cards in their hand at the time, must be at a research station and must use an action to "cure" that disease) complicated by several built-in timing mechanisms - if the card deck runs out, if all of one colour's cubes are exhausted, if eight outbreaks have occurred - the game is over. The game appears to be more difficult with more players and the different combinations of player roles can change the dynamics of game play considerably. Z-Man has done an excellent job with graphic design and production, with one caveat - the player pawns are far bigger than they need to be. A slight quibble for an outstanding game experience.

RATING: 8
starting to loose it's luster.  easy game to teach others, but every game seems to go the same.  Plus, the "alpha" person (or more experienced) person seems to run the ship causing an experience with very little real interaction.

playing against the system just isn't for me I think, I have similar feelings towards Arkham.

I'd rather play Agricola, TTR, or Tikal to name a few over this one.  still not a bad game, but not as great as I expected...

Holding off on comment until I've played it more.

Update: At best, it's the driest co-op I've played. Solid but still very, very dry. At worst, it's an excruciating exercise in quarterbacking. In one game I eventually just got up from the table, said, "Let me know when you all have figured out whether or not we can win," and walked over to talk to another group.  I'm just not interested enough in the game to suggest it, and if for some reason I do ever develop that interest again, it's such a staple that I would have no problem finding people who own it. So I sold it.

That intensification mechanic is magic. I play it solo, and would probably rate it lower as the player count increases as it's easy for players to feel disengaged from the game.

RATING: 9.5
I love the fact that it's the perfect balance for a co-op game-- it's short, yet there's enough options to be a different challenge each time, especially with the various options the expansion provides. It's also not super complicated to overwhelm new people-- I was able to teach the game successfully to most of my middle school-age youth group kids.

It does help that I don't know too many domineering people, so I haven't had someone dictate the others where to go yet... :)

RATING: 6.5
Not really a 5 player cooperative game so much as a 1 player game where everyone makes decisions by committee.  The mechanics are sound and the tension is good, but it really needs some kind of rules for limited information sharing between players like battlestar galactica.  I think the expansion with the bio terrorist could really improve the game.

RATING: 1
Ok.  I've got 8 plays under my belt so I feel it is safe to comment on this game.  I would say the best way to describe this is that the win-loss seems to be like solitaire -- you don't necessarily know if you are going to win when you begin, but it certainly feels like it is pre-ordained before you even begin.  It's through playing the game that you even know if you stand a chance.  Further, the game really seems to lend itself to players that are power control freaks.  Rather than each player trying their best, it seems that one person needs to dictate specific strategies to get anywhere -- and the likelihood of you winning can be nil if the (bad) luck of the draw screws you over.  Not fun.  We've won 1 game out of 8.  If you like to lose and move your pieces at someone elses behest, then this game is for you.  Otherwise, I recommend moving along.

UPDATE:  Wahooo!!  I traded this game off to someone.  Thank goodness for BGG! :)  I'm now the lucky owner of a Mah Jong set.

Great family/co-op game. I highly recommend adding the In The Lab expansion, but still plays great on its own. I'm pretty new to the board game community but I am having a great time sitting down with family and friends. This game is quick and easy to learn and has  plenty of strategy.

What more can be said of Pandemic. It is my favorite by a small margin, and the replay value is high. I actually enjoy the setup of the game, as the initially infected cities vary with each play. The theme is nearly impossible not to like, and the game is just tough enough to be challenging fun. I hope to get the On The Brink expansion soon!

Due to this game, i converted my non-gamer wife into gaming:) So this one will always have a special place in our collection. 
Co-op play is awesome. There is always a feeling for urgency both long term and short term. 
At higher difficulties when you beat the game you feel an accomplishment. 
But after winning at highest difficulty, the game starts to lose its charm and does not get on to the table much.

RATING: 7.5
Co-op, with an unforgiving viral reproduction rate. This encourages the players to anticipate, rather than merely react, in order to succeed. The more players, the better.

RATING: 8.75
Fantastic game, I've been playing a ton since it was given to me as a gift.
The first playthrough took a little while to get into because we found it a bit difficult to follow along with the format of the rules. Once we got more used to it though it became an instant favourite for everyone.
4 epidemic cards get prety easy after a couple of games but ramping it up to 6 is a great challenge that we all thoroughly enjoyed.
All in all a fantastic game.

RATING: 7.5
Pros: cooperative game, highly thematic, random roleplaying with special skillsets, highly tactical

Cons: prone to quarterbacking, limited strategic options, high degree of luck

The co-op game that defined co-op games, at least for me. Perfect level of difficulty due to a great balance between luck & decision-making. If players are able to figure out the most strategic, valuable decisions to make each turn, they are rarely rewarded with defeat. Fun roles for each player increase replayability.

Rush around the world using your special skills to treat outbreaks and cure diseases. The theme is extremely well captured in the game. Coop game for up to 4 players - also plays well as a solo puzzle activity. The cooperative nature, simple rules, and adult theme makes this an excellent gateway game. The kind of game a group will generally want to play a few times in a row to try new strategies in an attempt to beat the game.

RATING: 9
Maybe the best cooperative board game out there, as each player has a different role, and collectively they try to stop disease from taking over and covering the planet. Important: there are two editions of Pandemic. If you want to get the recent "On the Brink" expansion, you have to get the 2nd addition of Pandemic, not the original. Downside: if exactly one player is an intense strategist, they'll end up figuring out the best moves for everyone, and all the other players will end up simply taking orders. Otherwise, the game plays very well.

The prototypical cooperative game. Different roles work together to cure all the diseases in the world. The plays are basically playing against the board and racing against the clock to get diseases cured by running around the board removing cubes from cities and building research stations to eventually find a cure, etc. The game can definitely snowball on you as you draw more and more bad cards. 

I think this game is best played where you can't share information from your hand with other players. Like Shadows over Camelot you have to speak vaguely. Otherwise you'll get prone to planning moves way ahead of time and getting analysis paralysis. The worst problem is definitely quarterbacking though. If you have played it before and others haven't, make sure you really tone back the telling people what to do. It's helpful to give hints, but not to straight up plan peoples moves.

I like this game. It's definitely quality. But it's not my favorite, or even my favorite coop. I'd recommend playing it though.

We've played with 2 players, both with us each controlling one and with us each controlling 2.  It's a hard game either way, though probably easier with each controlling 2.  In several plays we have yet to actually beat the game, but it's fun enough to keep us playing anyway!

Looking back I wish we had gotten one of the other versions, just for thematic purposes.  However, if you are new to Pandemic this is not a bad way to go.  Just beware the difficulty level is steep and would probably be discouraging to children or non-gamers.  Rules aren't too hard, but I would still not consider this a gateway game.  If you want to make it easier, maybe toss out an epidemic card or two.

Game is very fun, my girlfriend and I play this one a lot great game for 2.  Only thing is the expansion adds a fifth player but its hard to tell how it actually does.  There are five role cards in the main game so how is it only a 4 player?  This confused me after we got "On The Brink" to add a player.  Only thing I can think is that it does add 6 new special action cards to make the player draw pile a few cards larger which may help for balance.

I love cooperative games, and this game has alot of what makes co-op games good packed into less than an hour. It scales well 2-4 players (although it's quite a bit easier with 2). The game can turn at almost any point, so it's hard to feel safe until you're right about to win. The epidemic mechanic is simply genius.

Little Petri dishes to hold the disease cubes, pill vials instead of the cured/eradicated tokens, and all around better vibe.  Great co-operative game in which you can set the difficulty based on your group's experience level.  Awesome stuff.

Great co-op game, we enjoy playing the game in family groups or gaming groups.  Only issue in being a co-op, of course, is that one person generally assumes the role of lead decision maker.  It is fairly avoidable depending on how you play, but come with the territory I suppose.

Pandemic is a great game where you cooperate to fight back outbreaks.  I find the game seems like it's too easy for about 75% of the game and then suddenly ramps up and you have to finish off the disease(s) quickly before they take over.  Well balanced/designed game.  Great co-op.

RATING: 5
Simple and appealing to light gamers and nongamers, but really not my cup of tea.  The theme is an interesting one, and the gameplay is obviously derived from it to a certain extent, but there are clear sacrifices to playability and gaminess that quickly make the actual gameplay about counting cubes.

My biggest gripe is that the deck has the biggest impact on whether the players win or lose.  Perfect play won't beat a bad draw, and bad play will do just fine with a good draw.  It's remarkably frustrating, and I don't exactly feel like I'm getting much better at this game, because it's pretty easy to hit the initial threshold of good play.  From then on, you're just along for the ride as the game decides if it's winnable or not.

RATING: 9.1
Very enjoyable on first play. Cured one disease but didn't even come close to winning. 
Third game, we cured three diseases and was able to re-arrange the top six cards but couldn't prevent the eighth outbreak from occuring I made of the mistake, early on, of not using my special ability to remove all cubes with my Medic, so that may have lost us the game. 
Lost extremely quickly on my fourth game with 8 breakouts, but won my fourth game for my very first win. 
Won my two past games with one being easy and the last being down to the wire...time to up the difficulty? Rating it a 9.2 for now. I'm going to change the score (9.2-9.1) to balance with my new Carcassonne score.

First night we ever played it hit the table 8 times until we finally beat it. We have never touched it again. The fact that we had that drive to play a game so many times, and it never got boring, is worth the (9) in itself. If you have friends that can work together as a team GET THIS GAME!

RATING: 9.4
Simply the best co-op ever made, and one of the best games period. Challenging, and scales excellently for all possible players, from 1 to 5. I love the puzzle solving aspects of the game, as you collectively work out a plan to win the game. 

I really don't believe in the so called "one person runs the game" criticism. One: if you're the guy attempting to control everything, just shut up and listen to what others have to say. Two: if you're playing with someone like this, SPEAK UP! Say what you think is the best move, if you disagree. No one can control the game on your turn except you. If you think it's the best move, MAKE IT. Regardless, it's silly to blame the game for your game group problem.

I like the idea of co-op games but the only ones that I had played were Arkham Horror and LOTR. Those are good games but l-o-n-g. This one finished up in about 45 minutes with 4 epidemics. A nice beat-the-clock feel to it and I would certainly play this again. I liked the map, the chunky wood pieces and the gameplay. It is not something that I would buy, I think, but definitely worth the play time.

(After 3 4p games)  My only other cooperative game play has been Shadows Over Camelot and Descent (if that counts).   This game seems "fresh" and is a pretty quick play.  It does seem that many of your actions are "forced" upon you depending on your role.  Look forward to trying to beat this game and would like to try with varying number of player
s.

(2.09)   2 more 3p games at the highest difficulty.  Split, one win, one loss.  I enjoy it a little more with 3, now of course I want to see how it plays with 2.

Haven't played Pandemic for over a year but we brought it out today and it is such a great game! The rules are easy to grasp, it plays fast and is quite challenging (even on easy level sometimes: I remember one game when we died on the first turn because of unlucky infection card draws when setting the game up; it only took us 1 card that set off a chain of outbreaks. Good times.)

I know its sacrilege, and maybe because I played FI first, but I would rather play forbidden island or forbidden desert over this. Too abstracted for me, dislike the card sharing rules. I feel I get less or equal for more time and complexity. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
So I guess this is the insanely hard version of Forbidden Island? Not sure which came first. Anyway, should be a lot of fun but I have never been in a group that beat the disease. Even on easy level. Really hard. Also, if you play with someone who has a strong personality, they can take over the game and then it's no fun for anyone.

UPDATE: We finally beat this game, by the skin of our teeth. Beating the game has had a strange effect. Now that we know it is beatable, we want to play it a lot more. Every time we lose we want to try again immediately. Still insanely hard, but we have found hope!

Hey! We beat it again about 100 plays later! We didn't eradicate anything, just kept the outbreaks in check. Totally counter to what I thought was the best strategy. I wonder if we keep playing like this if it will be easier to win...

RATING: 6
First 'co-op' game I've picked up. Fun, but feel there should be something much more fun to fill that gap in my collection. (Edit: Lowered rating one, becomes less and less fun each play-through. Too much guiding of other players by someone strategizing making it almost feel like a one player game.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
One of my all-time favorite cooperative games.  The theme is strong and the tension/difficulty is great.

Some games self adjust based on the players' performance.  If the players do well, the game 'punishes' them by becoming harder.  If the players are doing poorly, the game 'helps' them by becoming easier.  That helps games stay interesting, but it discourages trying really hard to play well (since it just makes life harder)!

Pandemic is not like that at all.  Good teamwork and diligence pays off.  Some sloppy play early on will be punished.

The biggest issue with this game is that one dominant/alpha player can easily start dictating what other players do on their turns.

Overall, it's an exceptional game that requires players to work closely together, utilizing each role's specialties.

I am not a huge co-op game fan but it really works for this game.  The game achieves a nice tension for the players trying to beat the diseases.  The four player games I have played in have been very difficult to win.  There is quite a high replayability.  It is the type of game you want to play over and over to try and win!! It seems to work best with 4 players.  With two, it seemed much easier to beat the diseases.

I loved this game when I bought it. And since I felt enamored by it, I played quite a few rounds of it. I even bought the app during my winter holiday because my sis didn't want to play anything and I was feeling desperate! With the app I could play solo.

And so I grew bored of Pandemia. Seriously bored.

This is why it now only has a rating of 6.5 from me. Without any expansion the sessions begin to grow repetitive really fast. In order to help myself - and this game - I've bought one expansion thus far: 'The State of Emergency'. In reality I would have wanted to buy 'In the Lab' but it requires 'On the Brink' which is sold out. Plus, 26 € is a lot less than 35 € + 35 €.

The game plays very quickly. There is a lot of table talk and this can cause some players to have their turns practically played out for them. As long as it is a group discussion and everyone agrees on the plan of action I don't see this as a problem. Much of the fun of the game was running through different scenarios which would play out several turns in advance to beat the game. But then the game throws a curve ball and it's back to the drawing board. We played 2 beginner setup games and lost the first one (minus the researcher) and won the second (minus the medic). I'm looking forward to playing with the standard setup next. 4 more beginner games (1-3). We won the one without the operations expert. *UPDATE* 5/13. My friend (dispatcher) and I (Op.Spec.) beat Heroic level. It helped that we didn't pull any black cities in the initial 9 and that area was the first to be cured and sunshined. *UPDATE* 5/20 BEat heroic level again. This time with scientist and medic. We sunshined Blue and Red fairly quickly.

There's a tendency for one or two players to dominate the game, making less experienced and less extravert gamers have to sit back and follow orders. Keep your hands to yourselves (though not necessarily secret) as one step to counteract this.
Apart from that, it's a veeery intense, very exciting game. And it always surprises new gamers how the well the co-operative mode works.

What more can be said about this modern classic? For me this provides a pure and puzzly cooperative experience. I really like it as a 2 player game, and it is perfect for an evening with a good friend. I don't feel the need to pull this one out when meeting up with my bigger gaming circle, but for those family/few-friends at home nights it is perfect. I think this will stay in my collection forever.

Interesting.  I can see this being much more replayable than other cooperative games, what with the way the roles and the infected cities come into play.  I can also see it falling prey to the "Meathead" effect, where the most experienced player dominates the decisions made by the group, but I think it's less pronounced than with other games in this category.  I think it's important for ANY cooperative game to allow players to discover it on their own.  A good leader can direct play without being pushy.

It took a while to begin playing the game correctly, but even during that time, it had a lot of appeal to it, and it has that "tickle" effect, where it settles in the brain for further analysis.  It's not a deep game, by any means, but I can see it being enjoyable, and easy to teach.  And because of the trickiness to remembering the rules, be aware that if your first game seems too easy, you're likely playing it incorrectly.

There is something that i like about pandemic, but there is also something that i don't like. The problem is that i don't know what it is in both of the cases!

Honestly Pandemic isn't really my cup of tea. I decided to go ahead and buy it after a few years of looking at such high reviews. The first time I played this game in a group of 3 it was not bad. Towards the end it was getting a little crazy but it was all calmed down in the end. The second time I played it in a group of 4 and that time around I decided to make the difficulty harder since there was an extra person. Yet that turned into the easiest game I have ever played in my life. We all just kind of took our turns without a care in the world. The outbreaks never got anywhere near out of hand, each virus was controlled, and we found a cure for them all without any stress inhibiting situations. We won the game yet there was no satisfaction for winning. We all just sat around the board asking, "That's it?" Maybe I'll give the game another chance sometime later down the line but for now it will definitely not be one of my go to games.

What a winner. Addictive play with great variety. Smooth game design with an appealing theme. This might replace all of our other favorites two player games (Dominion, Magic, Morels) for a while. The only reason I do not grant a full 10 is that there is no solution for quarterbacking that could reign me in a bit. Also, there have been some innovations to co-ops since that this classic does not incorporate of course (permanence etc.). I might increase this rating once we checked out the expansions...

RATING: 6
I know this game is very popular and I can understand how that is.
I on the other hand find it punishingly hard and for no good reason.  What comes across as a strategy game in which players work together to cure the world of 4 spreading diseases, is in fact a luck-based game in which the order of cards in the draw deck pretty much dictates whether you will win or lose.
Furthermore, a well-thought-out theme of research centers, players with specialized roles, and an efficient system where disease spreads across borders falls apart with an awkward mechanic of "playing 5 cards" to cure a disease.  With such detail put in to creating methods to lose, the only method to win is the least thematic of them all.
In the end, it feels like a game that was simply written to be hard.  Change one number in the rule book (such as number of cards needed to cure a disease) and you'd have a completely different game on your hands.
Lastly, realize that Pandemic is a solitary game.  The number of players you have is completely irrelevant.  You can take each turn yourself, or share with a friend - there's really no difference.
I've played several times, and had the same challenges each time.  The game doesn't change much, play after play - it just comes down to which cards are drawn when to determine if you'll win.

You are specialists at the CDC/Atlanta where you watch several virulent diseases break out simultaneously all over the world. The team mission is to prevent a world-wide pandemic outbreak, treating hotspots while researching cures for each of the four plagues before they get out of hand.
\13\\13\
Players must plan their strategy to mesh their specialist's strengths before the diseases overwhelm the world. For example, the Operations Specialist can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases. The Scientist needs only 4 cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal 5. But the diseases are breaking out fast and time is running out: the team must try to stem the tide of infection in diseased areas while developing cures. If disease spreads uncontrolled, the players all lose. If they can cure all four diseases, they win.
\13\\13\
The board shows earth with some big population centres. On each turn a player can use four actions to travel, cure, discover and build. Cards are used for this but the deck also contains Epidemics...
\13\\13\
Note: Pandemic: On the Brink expansion is store in the base game box. The expansion allows a 5th player.

After a bunch of plays this is still coming out for more. The expansion, in my view, is a must. But if you have the expansion, this should last you a long time. It is still easy to mess up and play suboptimally, indicating there is a fair bit of depth once you add all of the special actions and characters.

That said, people have complained about "that one jerk" who dominates play. As "that one jerk" who tends to dominate the game, I may have a biased view. However, I'm usually not the one to suggest the game, leading me to believe that my guests are having a fun time as well.

Pandemic is one of those games that I enjoy more for the cleverness of the design than the actual gameplay. Don't get me wrong, I do think it's a lot of fun. I just feel that it is more of a puzzle than a game and that winning or losing is often as much of a function of the randomized deck or the order of roles as it is of playing well. Normally this would turn me off, but I am truly fascinated by the mechanisms that drive the game. Stacking the discard pile on top of the draw pile to intensify disease outbreaks as the game goes on and having the outbreaks that are left untreated start to cascade around the world map are both ingenius ideas that add loads of tension and excitement to what is otherwise a pretty dull set collection game. I'm not sure how well it will hold up to repeated play, as it seems to me that once everyone at the table knows what they are doing, the game will sort of play itself. Like solitaire, winning or losing will probably have already been determined by the shuffle.

Amazing design though...Hats off to Matt Leacock.

Intense, cooperative and cerebral.  Well mapped out and progresses rapidly, building tension the whole time.  

Tends to get a bit annoying if you are playing with both experienced folks and newbies, as the exp folks tend to quarterback the game and tell them how to play.  This is not good for learning and developing as a player, so keep this in mind and use it as an opportunity to teach and develop others skills rather than take over.

The scalable difficulty level, quick and easy to grasp rules, well-integrated theme, and quality components all combine for an excellent gaming experience.

My only real complaint is one of scale.  The pieces are too large for the board.  They don't fit in the city spaces - it's very easy to over-fill a city enough that pieces look like they're in an adjacent city instead of the one they're supposed to be in.  The pieces need to be shrunk (except for the cubes; they're okay), and the board enlarged slightly.  This is the second printing, too.  I thought there were enough complaints about this the first time around that it was going to get fixed.

With a group that works together (even if debating the best course of action), this game is incredible. Every card draw is tense and every move walks the fine line between success and failure. Defeat encourages you to try again; victory encourages you to see if you can keep the streak going. I played this 7 times in two days with the same group, and we never got tired of it.

2013-09-02
After having a lot of plays in just a few other co-op games, I can see that there is much less cooperation involved in Pandemic. Yes, each player has their own specialized roles that help the group, but the only thing that can be accomplished on your own is removing disease cubes (a minor task, overall). Because of this, the game doesn't come down to working together so much as putting everyone's ideas to a vote. I have to lower my rating from a 9 to a 6, since it's no longer my first choice in co-op games.

This is an extremely well-designed game with a unique and clever theme that I just don't enjoy all that much.  It's absolutely worth playing if you like co-ops though, just because it's so dang smart.  

The best example of cleverness in this game is that, unlike in so many other co-ops, the bad stuff that happens to you is not [i]completely[/i] random.  After each epidemic, the cities that were infected last round get shuffled and placed on top of the deck.  This means that the same cities will be infected over and over again.  This not only makes the situation more desperate (building tension), but also means that you can really strategize around the cities that you [i]know[/i] will come up (just not exactly when).  Everything seems to be designed around these basic tenets of controlled randomness, building tension, and partial information.

Clearly, I respect this game a lot.  I just don't love it.  The biggest problem for me is an extremely petty one: I hate preparing the deck before each game--shuffling the cards, dealing out the hands, dividing the rest into little stacks, shuffling an epidemic card into each stack, and stacking them all on top of each other. Blah!  If someone else would take this job off my hands, I would like Pandemic much more.  This is evidenced by my greater like for Forbidden Island, which is very similar without the deck building business.

The second problem is that the game just feels "samey" after a while.  Everyone I've introduced it to loves this game, so we play it fairly often, and it just always feels very similar.  The consistency of the game is part of what makes the design so smart, but ultimately it hurts it a bit in my eyes.  You never play a game of Pandemic and say, HOLY CRAP THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE!!!  I'm hesitant to say this is because the game isn't random enough because it's true that you get fluky situations like 5-6 of your first cards all of one color (leading to a quick loss).  I think it has more to do with how constraining the game is in general, leaving not many opportunities for truly creative play by the players.

The expansion does help mix things up quite a bit, and it breathed a bit more life into Pandemic for me.  And of course, as I've already stressed (and is reflected in my score), I think Pandemic is a very smart game in a lot of ways.  I just don't have enough fun while playing it.

Amazing cooperative game.  This was the first coop game I played and I enjoyed it.  It is easy to understand, and teach to non-gamers.  Plus I enjoy that the level of complexity can change based on how many epidemic cards you add in.  fantastic game that can cause some stress but always a blast to play.

I think three things makes this game brilliant:
- The way how you shuffle the cards back on top of the infection deck and you get outbreaks
- The way how you really have to plan together for giving each other the cards needed to win
- The way how you have to balance not losing (cleaning up the diseases and manage time) and wining (curing the diseases).

One of the first games I purchased when I discovered BGG. Drove two hours one way to pick it up from another Geek because it was still out of print at the time. Fun game, but haven't played it much lately. Maybe it's because I'm always teaching and end up practically playing the game by myself. Though it's great to see the game 'click' with new players.

Info for Traders:
I want to be upfront about this game. It's a first edition copy so there is slight warpage that doesn't affect play. It's something that afflicts many (if not all) first edition copies, I'm not sure about more recent editions. Also, I have not yet sent in my 'Operations Expert' card to Z-man for the 'linen finish' deck, yet. I'm waiting on news for them to be available.

Before Space Alert (and more recently Mice & Mystics), Pandemic was easily my favorite co-op game. It still is in my Top 10 games, and it served as that next-step game after Settlers of Catan (for me, at least). I love the theme, the various loss mechanics, and the tension that happens naturally when the world is on the verge of collapse from disease. Fantastic game that I will always want to play.

It used to be an "8", but now I have to say that it won't be easy to go back to this version of Pandemic after playing Pandemic Legacy. It is "too basic" and doesn't have that much to offer when compared to its bigger brother. It's a solid game, but now I feel that it requires some expansions in order to stay fresh and interesting. 

Still, if you've never played Pandemic Legacy you should enjoy this basic version of Pandemic quite a bit. It's a cool co-op game with simple rules and involving gameplay. The theme comes through really nicely. I strongly recommend playing with 4 players - this game is all about teamplay and table talk, therefore it loses a lot of charm when played only with 2.

Mmmm...diseases.  Now all they need is to have a bioinformatician role...

Very good coop game.  Very clean design, controlled randomness.  Somewhat more of a puzzle than a game,  but a good (and tough!) puzzle.

You can see a guaranteed win from a couple turns away sometimes,  which is anti-climactic.  Actually,  the ability to predict the probably state of the board a couple turns into the future is both a plus (long term coordinated plans are very possible) but also a minus (by the end of the game, there are no real surprises,  just "unlucky draws") 

But when the system has you over the barrel,  you can end up sweating bullets as you flip the cards.

If rating was on the size of the box it would get a 10. It has a soft silky feel too. Game play is excellent - joint puzzle solving with tension.  A race 'against the clock' - one way to win but 3 ways to lose. The theme fits perfectly - especially well used in the infecting draw/discard pile. Oh and I like the dobbers. Trouble is that it is more than a discussion than a game so can imangine it won't get much play. Played again 2016 and enjoyed it more so have rerated to an 8.

As far as co-ops go, this one is very good.  I have found it to be either too difficult, or too easy.  We can't quite find a sweet spot.  If you decide to teach this game to new players, here's a word of advice:  Don't coach too much.  I had a new player once tell me he did not like to game because he didn't really play, the other three players just told him what to do.  So either teach the game to all new players at once, or be able to sit back and let them make their own decisions even if you know they are not the best.

This is an 8 after two 3-player plays of the Intro Game. Will update after more plays. But for now, I'm hooked! I just love the pressure and the pretty convincing feeling that doom is slowly spreading all over the globe. And it's fast, too!

Production values are so-so: cube and pawns are very rough, and the cards have next to no coating. Use card sleeves if you don't want the cards to soak up any and all moisture.

[EDIT] After 30 plays, I'm still having a ton of fun with this one. Winning remains very difficult, even at "normal" level (five epidemic cards). Looking forward to more games of this.

I think this is a brilliant cooperative game. I am particularly fond of the way it allows players to adjust the difficulty level.

If the theme were different, I would probably rate this as a 10.

I love the co-operative element of the game and how intense the game can be depending on what cards you draw. It's a lot of fun- requires a very particular type of strategy that I can easily handle. Perhaps I love this game so much because I've played it so often that I have the hang of it, or maybe it's because of the inevitable suspense felt while playing. Or maybe it's just the cooperative aspect, who knows? In any case, I really like this game. :)

Highly recommend this game.

Oh and btw we lost the first game and still had a great time playing and were talking about it afterwards, trying to figure out what we did wrong or what we could do better next time.

A really interesting game.  Very unique I found.  I like the cooperative aspect of it, and others have commented on how it encourages conversation.

Since I'm often the dominant player, I like it as I can strategize

Eén van de beste co-ops die er is.

Spelers zijn allemaal specialisten die wereldwijd epidemieën bestrijden. Dit doen ze door samen te werken aan vaccins en deze uiteindelijk toe te dienen. Maar ze moeten wel snel zijn, want anders zijn de ziektes niet meer tegen te houden.

Een co-op met voldoende diepgang en vooral een vrij hoge moeilijkheidsgraad.

RATING: 9.5
This is one of my favorite co-op games.  The theme of the game is great.  The game has a couple of adjustments that can be made to scale the difficultly of the game.  On the most intense level, it can be a challenging game to win.  You can play it however you like.

The challenges of this game for some are that it is a co-op game.  My wife enjoys game for the competition and she can't get into it as well when the competition is with the game and not another player.  Also, since this game is a co-op, it lends itself to an "alpha gamer" situation, where one player might talk through all of the decisions and actually be the only one playing the game.  You have to be in a group that is either tolerant to having an alpha gamer situation, or with players that can restrain themselves from being an alpha gamer.  

With that said, it is a great game.  I always have a great time playing this game.  It just doesn't seem to fit as well with as many gamers as other games might.

A problem I have with co-ops is that someone usually bossess around everyone else, and I think this game suffers from that.  Saying that.

RATING: 7
A challenging crisis-management co-op game, which might not be fun for newbies the first couple of plays if playing with experienced players, because those with the experience will typically play the game for the noobs.  When all players understand the game, then it could be fun because of the interaction and discussion between the players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A nail-biter, teeth-clencher, and billfold-emptier - all at once.

Tight rules and excellent cooperative gameplay, but the game can spiral out of control (billions killed, whoops!) through absolutely no fault of the players.  There's not a high-percentage chance that it will happen, but it's certainly possible.

If one player is more experienced than the others, it's best for that person to pipe down and let the others enjoy themselves.  A backseat germ-killer barking out orders can spoil everyone's fun.

RATING: 4
I like Pandemic but I think that it fails as a cooperative game. There are two important reasons for this: abstraction and necessity.

The game of Chess is an abstraction. The players are representative of two noble parties in feud as they compete over a given plot of land. The land itself is represented by a logical map and not a physical one. The individual pieces move in accordance with abstract rules, only loosely in keeping with the roles for which they are named - while it is true that a King relies greatly on his subjects or a mounted Knight might be afforded greater mobility, the nature of a Bishop's movement speaks more to play mechanics than it does any interplay between theology and monarchy. Similarly, games like Go and Checkers and even Tic-Tac-Toe are abstractions; they are oppositional games of strategy and tactics. Theme in these sorts of games is superfluous because the players are primarily engaged in left-brain activity.

Despite its dressing, Pandemic is also an abstraction. The theme of epidemiology might easily be substituted with one of farmers faced with the spread of weeds among their crops. The map, while seemingly more realistic than a chess board, remains a logical representation governed by arbitrary rules. Each player, assigned an appropriately themed identity, is granted unique abilities - and these abilities are incorporated to facilitate (or force) player interaction, not because they engender a personal relationship between each player and his or her given role.

The appeal of Chess is not diminished by its abstraction for two reasons: it pits players against one another and, further, it does not necessitate communication among players on the same team.

When you eliminate the opposing player, an abstract game is more akin to a puzzle. There remains no emotional investment of pride. The incentive of winning is reduced to the exercise of skill; and the challenge becomes merely a question of comprehension and complexity.

When you take an abstract puzzle - such as I characterize Pandemic to be - and you introduce the pretense of teamwork, you're going to run into trouble. People don't rally under abstraction. It takes necessity, language and sometimes even symbolism for people to unite.

Simply put: Pandemic allows for two-to-four players, but it only requires one. In fact, the aphorism that two heads are better than one doesn't even apply. Each additional player only introduces additional frustration.

The mechanics of Pandemic are not exceedingly complex. Many have already attested to the fact that on any given turn there exist only a few - sometimes as few as one - reasonable actions of play. Because of the manner in which played cards are reshuffled, a careful player can very easily anticipate and preempt imminent obstacles. The more you understand the mechanics, the easier the game becomes; and by extrapolation, a general solution can be devised and applied.

I approach Pandemic the same way I might approach Sudoku. Both are abstract puzzles, though they initially appear to be otherwise (beginners often mistake Sudoku for a math problem, however, the numbers could just as easily be substituted with the first nine sequential letters of the alphabet).

I suppose you could attempt to solve a Sudoku puzzle with a partner. Having identified the right number for a particular cell you might then explain to your partner why it is so. But your ability to communicate why it is the right number and, further, your partner's ability to understand you has no bearing on the solution itself. The number is either right or it is wrong, and the deciding factor is not dependent on a consensus of the players. What's more, to communicate this way for each cell would become exceedingly tedious.

Pandemic is cooperative in the same sense that Sudoku might be cooperative if you and your partner took turns with the pencil. A given player is no more or less empowered with respect to whose turn it might happen to be; the game is simply played by whomever identifies the next best action.

Awesome cooperative game that gets better every time we play it.  I still love this game even after more than 60 plays, so it deserves a full 10 rating.  The OTB expansion is a must-have.

The difficulty level can be scaled up or down dramatically based on the number Epidemics you put in the deck and the number of players you have.  In both cases, more = more difficult.

All of my recorded plays from 10-12-09 and later include OTB in some way (new roles and special action cards).

Current W-L records:
[color=green]- 4 Epidemics (Standard): 11-7*[/color]
[color=brown]- 4 Epidemics (VStrain): 3-1[/color]
[color=purple]- 4 Epidemics (Mutation): 2-1[/color]

[color=green]- 6 Epidemics (Standard):  3-5[/color]

(Overall: 36-27)

This coop board game is a fantastic and brutal glimpse at how quick a disease can spread.  Your game will be a slow but thoughtful hour as you carefully utilize your friends' roles to stop multiple outbreaks. Losing can be anti-climatic, unfair, or awkward at times, but finding all four cures is a rewarding experience and will hook you to play more.

A good co-operative game. Fun to play. I just dislike a little the concept, cause most of the time, there is a leader in the group that will direct the co-operative games in his own way, having all the players doying what he wants them to do. So why not playing solo then??? The problem is also that this leader will always be the same one.

Adored the theme, was looking forward to another co-op game (as they sometimes go over well with people who don't like direct conflict in their games), but it's too dry, too rote, too obvious what the best move is at any given point.  Though there is interaction between the players, it often isn't very (individually) fun.

Was initially put off by the cover art and theme, but kept seeing the game show up on Geeklists, so finally grabbed a copy - glad I did!

This is a current favorite of our gaming partners, as we work well together & so really enjoy the cooperative aspect of the game.

It continues to be tense, with palpable dread as the infections spread, and relief as they are cured, and despair as the last city outbreaks just as we were about to cure the final disease.

So far, much easier with 2 players, so more interesting to play with 4.

Tried this game at PrezCon 08 on Saturday.  It's a co-op game which appealed to me because it's nice to play different types of games.  I enjoyed it very much and I hope I get another chance to play it again soon!

I like it, I like Defenders of the Realm better, but this has a neat theme which I enjoy and is a co-op I like to get new players into, for me personally I will almost always play with on the brink and in the lab which really flesh out this game for me.

I like Flash Point better, mainly because of the theme. But the theme is still strong in this one, and the game is perhaps intrinsically harder than Flash Point is. I definitely won't play with open hands again--the Alpha Player can be real in this one.

[microbadge=31774] This was one of the first games in our board gaming collection. It introduced us to co-op board games, which opened up the entire wonderful world of board games. However, we moved on to other games we enjoyed more, and this never saw any play time eventually. We will likely keep buying the Pandemic Legacy games, and we also have Pandemic: the Cure, so this didn't really have a spot in our collection anymore, despite the good memories. We gave it to Michael for his birthday. He's trying to introduce his girlfriend to board games, and I know that this one is a couples classic. I hope it finds more plays with them!

RATING: 5
Kind of dry, a little too predictable in some ways.  When I first played this, it seemed great.  But after a few plays, you realize there aren't a whole lot of real meaningful choices, exacerbated by a misplaced use of randomness.  It's not a bad game, but it really became less appealing the more I played it.  Plus, it has some of the more horrible pitfalls of coops (eg domineering players), without providing some of the more charming aspects of coops (eg traitors).  Great for "non-gamers," but not much that I can see to satisfy those who want some more heft to their games.

Actually the first co-op game i really enjoy. After Crusoe and Battlestar Galactica which seem to have the more "epic" approach that appeals to me on paper, but not in the real world so far, Pandemic seems to tick all the right boxes. It's balanced, it's fun, it doesn't take forever and there's pace throughout the game. Simple, yet complex to figure out how to beat the virus. Easy to play with pretty much anyone.

I don't really enjoy the set collection and hand management in these type of games. It is really difficult to trade cards to each other so it feels too luck dependent on drawing the color you need. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like this game a lot for multiple reasons, but the primary reason is that it is simple enough to play with my parents and complex enough to engage me.  The difficulty level is also easily modified too.

Additionally since it is cooperative, people of varying levels of board game experience can play, and as they gain experience, you can add more difficulty (epidemic cards).  If you add the expansion you can add even more complexity and difficulty.

I have to confess, that I love cooperative board games so remember that when reading my comment.

RATING: 8.5
Great gateway game to introduce people to the co-op genre.  The theme is fantastic and the differing roles really give the players a unique perspective to bring to the table each game.  The game really culminates well as your team is getting closer to victory, yet so is the board!  

Lots of fun to be had here.  Game does have some problems; most notably being very prone to a One Man General type syndrome where someone can ruin all the fun of discovery for the group.  The game really feels like a puzzle you are trying to solve with your team and is unique each game.

I haven't played Pandemic since the beginning of 2013 and I believe that there are a number of reasons for it. The first being that this is a brutal coop. I know that there are people that say that it's "easy" and that they have expansions to make it more difficult but I believe that my win percentage is well below 50%... and that's just the base game. I recall playing a few games with my wife where we were just destroyed and having her say that she "played games for fun and this just wasn't fun". While I don't agree with that statement 100%, I do understand where she was coming from. The game sets you up for failure and, depending on the card draws, and beat you down to a pulp. If you're not in to that style of game where the game itself is trying to destroy you, I can see how it wouldn't be "fun".

The next knock against it is that you really need to play with a full compliment of people and/or play with two people using two roles each. It seems like the game was designed to work this way as certain combinations of roles seem vastly superior to others.

And the final knock against it is that it can suffer from the alpha-player syndrome (as many coops can). I don't know how you can negate that concern other than trying not to be the alpha-player, but it's a concern and something that needs to be taken into account.

While I think that it's a great game to introduce people to newer types of board games as you're working together to beat the game, it isn't something that I'm chomping at the bit to play again soon.

Best game I've played so far! Cannot turn a game down. Every game is different, and every time something else happens. Must have a dynamic working team to play together! I don't get why some people (alpha males/females) can't play this game together. I find that even though my group are all dominant, we stick to the common factor, and try to do the best thing possible, and beat the GAME! Everyone should try it at least a few times, to fully understand, before they rate. Our group records are:

Ah, Pandemic... How you have enthused both me and my fellow players. In essence it's so straightforward, yet offers a gripping experience to save the world! Going all rescue rangers to rid the world of harm isn't something many other games can replicate in such an elegant way as Pandemic can. Everytime you come up with a plan together based on the latest events. "Are you gonna build that station there? Why not there? Or maybe you should do an entirely different action!" It's a game that provokes discussion among players. It's funny sometimes how people have different ideas to tacke a certain problem. It's psychology at its best.

Don't get me wrong, Pandemic is very fun, but there are a few things not to like, and it's not as deep as I want in a meaty board game.  On the plus side, it is perhaps the most perfect holiday game I've come across lately.

This game recently went from a game that I like to a game that I love. 
My mom and I were playing and were celebrating as we were a turn away from curing the fourth disease and winning. The player deck was less than half gone, so we thought we had it in the bag. Because we were so close to winning, we were not worried about all the accumulating disease cubes in Europe. Just then, there was a massive chain reaction outbreak and we lost. I was so impressed by how the game sneaked up on us and have been pulling it out more frequently ever since. 
Great game. I like the cooperative element. I play it with my non-boardgame playing family and they genuinely enjoy it.

interesting coop game... pretty hard it seems, unless you are really coordinated between the various characters.  you have to optimize your use of their special abilities.  also, seems extremely difficult if you don't have the medic.  playing with open hands is smoother, and better since all the information is "out there" anyways -- i.e. there's no information you're required to keep secret.  still it doesn't grab me that much, but i wouldn't refuse to play, most of the time.

RATING: 9
A couple comments on the components. The cubes and research stations are a little large. The cubes are easier to manage because there will never be more than three of one color at one city. However, if you get three cubes and three pawns and a research facility all in one city, spillover will occur. It isn't that big of a deal, but makes it kind of fiddly. The infection cards are black and I worry about them standing up to repeated playing. They certainly do look sharp though.

The infection / epidemic mechanic is interesting. There are a couple of threads discussing the details. By reading the rules, it does seem counter-intuitive, i.e. drawing off of the bottom during an epidemic. However, through playing it does make sense as this introduces a completely new city to contend with, along with intensifying the need to control the cities currently that have been infected.

A couple of thoughts.  First, this game is accessible to all. The rules are well-written, well-illustrated and don't leave many questions. For some, it may initially appear intimidating, but the system is very elegant. I also believe that being a cooperative game makes it less intimidating - everyone is working together. Second, I am wondering if three people is an optimum number. This gives three roles available in the game and doesn't dilute the player deck too much. Third, I can't see how you can win this game without the researcher. Every game I have played has included the researcher and that player has been the key to getting information to the right players. The medic is nice, but without the medic the strategy becomes controlling the cubes rather than eliminating them. The scientist can be helpful, but usually there are enough cards to pass around that one less isn't a deal breaker. The dispatcher, in my opinion, would be the second most important role. The operations expert is the weakest, and needs a secondary power such as immediately being able to move to any research station from any other city. Finally, the game isn't over until the final cure is reached. Games go from being won in two turns to being lost due to having no more cubes in stock due to outbreaks.

After a couple more plays I have increased my rating of this game. It is fun, and I enjoy playing it. In addition, my wife is already trying to figure out when the next time we will have people over so we can play. I reminded her that we can play with two, and she was ready to set the game up right then.

I've heard it said that Pandemic is the embodiment of the Alpha player problem. I reject that utterly. The alpha player is the problem. Not the game. If you are willing to stand up for yourself and tell the alpha that they are running the game for others then it will stop if they are a reasonable human being. If they dont stop then why in the world would you play games with that person?

I've also heard it said that Pandemic can be played solo, as though there were some problem with games that have 1 player variants. Can you play it alone? Yes. Is it more fun playing it with others? Yes. What is the problem?

The length of the game is great, the theme is awesome, the game mechanics are fantastic, it is a truly cooperative experience, the replayability is good, the learning curve is incredibly small. This game is incredible.

This is an excellent co-operative board game. Not only is it well-balanced, it is also thematically very apt. Game time is under an hour and that makes it suitable as a family game. The artwork is reasonably well-done as well.

A small concern is the low winning percentage which may turn away some gamers. This is especially so if you draw an early Epidemic card. My Significant Other and I, fortunately, do not fall into this category.

Fantastic game! I love the cooperative aspect of the game. The components are great. I love how crowded the board gets as more and more infections hit, and when you get an outbreak it's turns downright scary. Just a great game.

On the Brink is an essential expansion, it gives you so many new fun options.

Thoughts on Difficulty Level:
The number of Epidemic cards is obviously the main thing that increases the game's difficulty, while the Virulent Strain is fun, it is mereley a slight increase in difficulty, and the same applies, but perhaps even more so to the Mutation.

I think that the Virulent Strain, and the Mutation may be equal to perhaps 1/3 of an Epidemic Card, so just a small boost in difficulty. I also think that in a 2-player game it is very hard to win a game with 6+ Epidemic Cards.

We got alot of play out of it initially and the people I play it with like it and still ask for it occasionally but it feels more like solitaire to me and I have to work to not just point out what I think the best option is.  So while its a nice game, over time my enjoyment has dropped and I don't have near the fun playing it as some other cooperatives.

My wife and I love playing this. I've played it a few times with other people, and had quite similar sentiments. My brothers and I sat down to play it, and while my younger, teenager brother bowed out due to lack of sleep, my other older brother and I were engaged until the end. Difficulty levels can scale well, and the different roles make the game quite interesting. Having now played Forbidden Desert which has similar mechanics, I might have appreciated something that makes the tiles shift, but I suppose pandemics/outbreaks themselves fill this role.

Very accessible co-op game. Scales very well to the level of the players. I can play this with anybody, and they will still ask for more. I prefer Ghost Story if I had to pick one single co-op game, but for most casual players Pandemic is a must-play. Game hits hard in the tougher difficulty classes, but it's still interesting even if you lose. I would although say that some roles are clearly better than others. Not playing with the guy giving away cards makes it a true challenge.

I really liked this - husband not so much. The novelty of playing co-op was a big factor for me. Think we will throw in all the epidemics next time we play. I can also see it would be much more intense with more players. Curious about Legacy, but I wouldn't jump on that before we've worked out if we actually enjoy the base game.

Great gateway game for its relatable theme and co-op decision making. New players can contribute or make as many or few decisions as they want and the game still progresses. This saves us from "brain burn" and "analysis paralysis."

Scales well and has various difficulty levels making it very versatile for many gamers/levels.

*Update* After more plays, I find the "Dictator" effect to be in full swing with many play groups. This ends up breaking a lot of co-ops for me. I think co-ops with specific role knowledge/hidden information help mitigate this potential issue.

Good standard cooperative game, one of the best of its kind, however can be dominated by one sole player 'Bossing' everyone around (that is usually me because I'm a veteran at this game, sorry guys!). However, give your players (especially new ones) some room to make their own decisions, don't force them to do what you want them to do (at most give suggestions) and this will be a great game.

This is a cooperative game... meaning everyone wins or everyone looses together.  the goal of containing worldwide disease was very well done, and the restocking of the deck whenever you draw an Epidemic card makes things very tense.  I really enjoy working with people to problem solve our way through the game and with the On the Brink expansion to always keep us on our toes.

I always love a good co-op game, but unfortunately a lot of them usually take way too long for my liking (i.e. Shadow Over Camelot and Arkham Horror), so Pandemic's promise of a 45 minutes play time is definitely something to look forward to.  I will however admit that I was unimpressed with the mechanics when I first read the rules.

Many of the reviews and session reports claimed that Pandemic was brutally tough on the players.  Some even went as far as to warn people not to expect to win in their first few games, so imagine my surprise when we claimed our victory with a comfortable margin (the city draw deck was still half full and the outbreak was only at 4), so much so that my reaction was a "is that it?"  Granted we didn't play with the advance rule, which I think is an addition of two more epidemic cards, but we did beat the game without the use of a medic, and that was a pretty big accomplishment if I do say so myself.

Ultimately, I did appreciate the tension and urgency one felt periodically throughout the game, especially during an outbreak.  Yet there were still lulls during the session in which I'm just going through the motion while waiting for something interesting to happen; would it be weird if I said I wanted epidemic to occur more often?  I like Pandemic, especially how quick it is, but my fear is that it won't stand up to heavy replays.  Considering there are only 5 roles available, I imagine that each game would be very similar to another outside of the combination of the roles randomly selected.  So the jury is still out for me on this one.

I'll be honest when I say I'm not particularly fond of this game. The mechanics are fluid, but I always feel so restricted as to what I can do. There's just not enough time to get around the board in the time provided. It also has the solitaire feel about it. One person often ends up dominating the strategy, leaving the rest of us to sit around.

Present Zang here: I'm reevaluating my previous rating on this one. I've played it a few more times, and it's growing on me.

This one can definitely give you an ulcer!

I picked this one up after the recommendations I received and I was pleasantly surprised.  

The game play is very intense and challenging.  It is nice to own a game that offers so many playing variations and this very much adds to the high replayability factor.

This one is truly difficult to beat. I like that!  You never know how any session will turn out.  You can refine your strategy every time and still be knocked down flat!

I have gotten a good grasp of the strategies involved to be victorious, but it isn't easy.  When you win, it truly feels like an accomplishment.  With the right group of people, this one could easily become a favorite.

The components are top notch and very nicely done.  I do feel I received my moneys worth.

The disease recurrence mechanism in this game is brilliant.  This is a nice, fast, collaborative game.  I think, however, that collaboratives aren't filling my sails much any more.  So, if you enjoy collaborative games, I totally recommend this.  You can't play a faster one.  In feel, it's like an elegant Arkham Horror, without all that die rolling and rules interpolation, that plays in like 30-60 minutes.  You trade out Cthulhu for pathogens, though.

There is way too much randomness for my taste. Especially finding cures is a pain, since there's rarely time to draw (or trade) enough player cards of the same color. We never won with five or more epidemics, which really drove me away. The best feature is the demand for player interaction. However, the whole course of the game is determined by how the card decks happen to get shuffled - which sucks. Gameplay is very mechanic and lacks interesting decisions or possibilities for alternate strategies.

RATING: 7
Nice co-op game with surprisingly good tension going on. You're struggling the whole time with the feeling that there is no time to save the earth from all consuming plague of pandemic viruses and yet still have that slight ray of hope that your struggles aren't in vain, that your actions will matter in the end. I like it. After 4 games with standard difficulty (with 1 win), I would definetly like to get this game. Although there is a slight worry back in my mind that how long this game will live with repeated gaming.

Hmmm. I was very excited to try this game out. I've been looking for an entry level coop for those not ready for the full-on Arkham Horror experience. Being a science geek, the biology theme was very appealing.

After a solo and a 2-player game, I'm left yawning. Pandemic feels like little wooden cubes placed randomly on a grid at the whim of a deck of cards - and thats it in a nutshell. The theme evaporates as the game begins. The only real strategy seems to be in efficient movement.

I'll give it a couple more tries to see if the highest difficulty evokes the sense of chaotic doom that I seek, but Arkham is calling me home...

I can see why so many people love this game. A tense and well balanced game. And the cooperative nature is great for those who are wishing to get into the hobby but worry their friends will just gang up on them.

This way, the game gangs up on everyone. 

You do have to be careful of the alpha-player problem, but that's usually resolved by ensuring the issue is addressed early on. Or so we've found. But we have pretty strong personalities and that may help.

Pandemic Legacy just takes this whole thing up a notch.

Not a game. I'd liken it more to a cooperative puzzle. Disclaimer: My rating might be influenced by the fact that the person I played with was in a vile mood more often than not.

Had a few games of it but the cooperative aspect didn't really come to the fore. It was too easy for one person with more experience to direct the rest but maybe thats just me lack of experience.

A great weeknight game. Haven't found a time where it challenged me yet, or when I lost...that is it's downfall. If it were harder, it'd be a 9 or a 9.5.

Can't believe I haven't rated this before. Played this several times over the last year with 2, 3 and 4 players. Pandemic is still one of the best or even the best co-op out there. The theme is tense and easy to grasp also for "non-gamers". The mechanics are unique and the components as well as the rules are top notch.

Замечательная кооперативная кризисная игра, но с рядом недостатков среди подобных: нет предателя (исправлено в дополнении), всего 4 игрока (аналогично), в игре всего одна стратегия - специализироваться своим персонажем, так что она либо проста, либо сложна, и это зависит только от искуственных настроек и параметров распространения вирусов.

I don't mind co-ops, but this experience fell a little flat for me. In the game we won it seemed like some of the plays were prescribed and it end up where one player was kind of quaterbacking the plays of the other players. Maybe the legacy games would be more interesting. Someday, when I've played all the other games I'll come back to this.

Pros: If you like coop games this is the best game you can play. You will repeat after losing the first game for sure!

Con: Try to avoid leader effect in your gaming gang when you play this game.

UPDATE2: On the Brink really did breath life into this, and the adjustable difficulty really keeps things interesting too. 2-player is also surprisingly fun, even when playing with just two roles.

----

UPDATE: Still enjoy the odd game of this. Tweaking the challenge level and using the added twists in On the Brink is fun. It works unexpectedly well as a two player game, since it makes sure you'll always be involved in the discussion of what to do next. The role-switch event card also becomes a lot more important and interesting.

----

The shine may be coming off this one. It's neat watching the diseases grow and putting out fire, but it may be a case of luck dominating the game once the basic set of necessary actions to take is figured out. Might turn around on this if some kind of deeper play is evidenced in future games. But the artificially separated cooperative element is also holding it back. Maybe there needs to be a better mechanic than "you can tell everyone what cards you have, without limit, but you just can't show them". Perhaps you can show one face-up card and that's it.

5/26/08: Dropped from an 8 to a 6 after repeated plays.  Sorry, Pandemic.

3/2/08: (4 plays so far 1:3 w/l ratio)I get a kick out of playing on the same side as my friends when playing games.  Pandemic does a nice job of generating interesting ways for players to work synergistically, which is a key factor in assessing a co-op game's goodness.

RATING: 7
Quick, tense and fun. Pandemic is an exceptional co-operative game and it should appeal to non-gamers as well.

My group has managed to beat it on hard and it's feeling a bit samey and predictable now, so we're putting it on hold for awhile.

I'm not a huge fan of co-op games, but this one is pretty neat.  I like the mechanics of how diseases spread and outbreaks occur.  There is a nice tension between needing to find cures for diseases and band-aiding the diseases to keep the board from getting out of control.

A solid game that I am usually willing to play, but one that has never (and likely will never) sucked me in. I wish I could love it instead of like it, but it's simply too obvious. Odd choice of words? Let me explain. Pandemic has a very clear turn order, and it becomes obvious what MUST be done on every turn. If one deviates from this, if one, in essence, chooses to play the game his/her own way, the game could very well be lost. Not my idea of fun. With Defenders of the Realm or Arkham, for example, a certain degree of failure is accounted for due to the randomness associated with the game. I prefer that sense of freedom and variability.

EDIT: 12/30/12
Just got back from a vacation where I had the opportunity to play this with a few kids (13-16). I'm bumping the score a half a point after seeing how great this game works with non-gamers. Finally found a solid use for it.

Game is fun for about 5 tries and then it just gets to be draining and samey. One player tends to just make decisions for everyone else and well....not much else to say. Get it if your a "party gamer", otherwise not recommended.

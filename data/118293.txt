A Carcasonne type game where you build your landscape simultaneously. Fun with the kids at least.

If Galaxy Trucker wanted to be a eurogame and would be developed as a game available for masses it will be Mondo Sapiens. Easy, quick, engaging, replayable - great game!

RATING: 6.5
This edition of Mondo adds some elements of complexity to the game (buildings, streets, different kind of workers), and can be played also with the standard rules. The graphical work is not the best, and in terms of aesthetics I prefer the base version of Mondo (with animals).

RATING: 6.5
Same mechanic like Galaxy Trucker, but without the risk of the second part. Just build your world. Think that you should reduce the time of each round as you play more and more (7 minutes is too much)

RATING: 3
The scoring doesn't really make sense, and is way more complex than the game itself.

RATING: 7
I clearly prefer Mondo.  Mondo Sapiens is a tad more complicated and unintuitive, but not resulting in more fun.
Goals and the 3rd type of terrain (desert) are missing too!

Maybe I would've been thrilled by Mondo Sapiens hadn't I played Mondo before...

Sold.

The time pressure in this game is very fun! Don't play it too often, otherwise you'll be an expert and the game won't be fun anymore.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Real time tile playing game (family version version of Galaxy Trucker, without the card phases; so, just doing the puzzles three times). 

It is a revised version of Mondo.

Differences Mondo vs Mondo Sapiens (according M. Schacht)
Global:
- Theme.
- Four new boards.
- The points mix (landscapes f. e. are less strong).
- For a good Mondo player it is harder to have a strong lead.

Beginners game (very close to Mondo)
- No deserts.
- The roads require a new way of placement.
- Slightly higher difficulty.

Advanced game:
- You have to include the three villages tiles to get points for the workers.
- Bonus points for majorities.
- Slightly higher difficulty.
=> more interaction because you usually place the type of workers where you see during the game a chance to get the bonus points.
=> in a two player game you even have the possibilitiy if you are last in play to see what the other has and just place the tiles that would make a majority.

Pro game:
- You can place a building tile which is an aditional option to gain points.
- Building tiles only count for a specific area/road.
- Each board offers another additional building which is an aditional option to gain points.
- Higher difficulty.
=> So, you have a lot of options to gain points. if you don't concentrate on some you will not able to win. so, you can play in Mondo Sapiens in different directions.
=> Each board has a different characteristic (like a scenario). with the first board f. e. it is lucrative to build islands. in another board you have to link the tavern with barrels by a road to gain the points.

Compared to Mondo:

+ More variety with the 4 different boards
+ More complex when adding all the stuff on a difficult board

- Mondo is more suitable for players who are not familiar with the principle
- The adding of the buildings for the expert level seems only interesting with 4 as you can have some competition; with 2 and 2 different buildings, they don't seem to be worth the effort of for example having to search for bor in the same forest.

Nice variation. A little bit more strategic then Mondo

RATING: 5
While the concept of the game is cool (I would have preferred the original Mondo though), it quickly felt, like the best way to win is to build little squares instead of a cool landscape - which totally killed it for me.

FRANTIC FUN! Mondo Sapiens is Michael Schachts answer to Galaxy Trucker that is less chaotic and more accessible for newer players or non-gamers. There are so many ways that a player can score points and each round players will compete to complete their island without mistakes the fastet, simultaneously struggling for the majority of a certain type of tile. What a great new interpretation of a puzzle game.

For a game that is so far away from the kind of games I like best (got it as a freebie), this is a surprisingly acceptable game. Very playable with children too.

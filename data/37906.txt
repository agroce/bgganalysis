Played three games and have bought the Starter Set - Return of the Overseer. 

Very enjoyable game and looking forward to much more playing.

13/04/15 - Rated 8 it might go up if I find that the games stay as much fun as the first three.

The rules need to be written a lot better than they are, but the system itself is fine, although a little basic.  However, more games of this will certainly only increase my opinion of this game, so I look forward to giving it another go.

Way too many counters detracting from the beautiful look of minis on the table.

Solid game that is fun and thematic to play. Balancing movement and firing arcs feels tactical. A bit reliant on dice rolls and the exploding dice mechanic can wildly swing some attacks. Inexpensive to start playing due to low cost of starter sets.

After playing this for over a year I can finally feel like I can give this game an honest rating. I've got to say I've been very impressed with this game. It's fast playing but with enough detail and flavor to make each race interesting.

Love it.  The same engine as Dystopian Wars essentially, but with a very different feel due to a couple of tweaks here and there.  There is a lot of flexibility in fleet building, all in all an excellent game that moves at a good pace and is a lot of fun.

RATING: 6
Pretty good ruleset if you're looking for something light that is basically age of sails in space. Some of the rules for defensive fire against torpedoes and fighters can be a bit fiddly but that's about it. 

Handles games with about 15-20 models per side fine.

EDIT after a few games: although I like Firestorm: Armada fine, when I play it I keep thinking about how we used to play Battlefleet Gothic and how I enjoyed that game more.

They're both "age of sails in space" but for me at least, BFG has a lot more theme and texture. In F:A it feels like whatever you do (fire broadsides, torpedoes or what have you) you just roll a large amount of dice and hit on 4+. I don't know... it simply doesn't capture my imagination like BFG did.

First impressions: The game is fast paced and great fun! Two minor gripes. 

1) It seems the ships are far too maneuverable for my liking. Turning is not a problem and even a battleship can come about 90 degrees in a single move action. The limit seems to be on the speed rather than the turning. I can live with it, but I think it'd be more fun if the capitals couldn't turn so fast.

2) Fixed forward arcs are extremely fiddly.

My rating is based on the recently released Version 2 rulebook. I hadn't played this before this release. I like this game very much. The upgrades available to each ship in a squadron makes it very interesting to build fleets and also provide some variety. The models are very detailed and nice...the Directorate Models that I own have so far been pretty easy to paint. This will get a lot of table time (when not playing Armoured Clash).

Miniature quality ranks high and isn't so expensive.

I rate the new V2.0 rules at 8, they are clearer than the previous ones and the fleet construction system is now headache free!
Lot's of clarifications and simplifications in this new version.

The ancien V1.5 rules would rate 6 and the V1.0 a meek 5

I recently bought this system and several fleet for the entire family, and just my luck the company Spartan Games just closed. The really sad part is that we really like this system and the models are awesome. I seem to have this luck with Tabletop miniature games.

Interesting take on small fleet spaceship battles, the level of abstraction is just right for me. I don't own any of the official miniatures, but the rules work fine with whatever you have (so long as you have enough).

After extensive play of Dystopian Wars the rules for Firestorm seem too simplistic. Want to enjoy this game more because of the fantastic model design but it seems to lack something. Will stick with Dystopian Wars. Update 6/'12- great deal on ding/dent box/got an Aquan Prime starter fleet

Previously owned this game, but there was no player community in my area (system was totally pulled from the 2017 NOVA Open).  Additionally, Spartan Games doesn't seem to be in the best place, so I dumped my minis on the market.  Too bad, as the overall game itself is actually good.  There's a lot of depth to play, and the exploding dice mechanic was a bunch of fun.  Unlike SW Armada, this game actually had you controlling lots of capital ships even in a low points game.  Miniatures are extremely high quality.

Haven't tried this out yet because of lack of opponents. But I certainly enjoy The Uncharted Seas, which was the base of Firestorm:Armada's rules. Some things seem to be impreved here, and it does look good too. So if you think you could get friend or two hooked in to this, I'd bet you won't be regretting your investment.

Firestorm Armada is a balanced fleet space combat game. It's easy to learn, straightforward in play, but surprisingly subtly complex to master requiring deep tactical play.

Another 2D space combat game - cloned over from their Steampunk and Fantasy Sailing games respectively. The only unique feature is rolling the ship over to bring the other arc to bear.  I still prefer the A Call to Arms series better. 

It is a closed theme game, so you really cannot use other existing ranges, which is rough as there are not many fans of starship combat games. 

Unfortunately Spartan Games has also released some models, and redone them, so if you do not regularly follow the game the look of your ships may have changed - in specific the Terrans. You can see this between the 1st and 2nd edition rulebook.

The second bad feature is the scale. These are large figures, and not really cross compatible with other games. Spartan has taken the initiative in scale creep along with a couple of other manufacturers. 

Lastly the card system is a nice touch. Held over from before. But the cards are poor quality, and are not listed in the rulesbook if you cannot find them for purchase.

Rating after an initial play.  Really cool game with high-quality miniatures and simple rules.

Feels very much like big-ass naval battles in space, although some additional rules for fighter wings and torpedoes really keep things fresh.

My local game group is all over this title, and I absolutely see the appeal.  Looking forward to logging more plays!

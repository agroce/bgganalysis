Based on 1 play with 5 players.
I just didn't really enjoy the game.  Maybe it was because I was on the wrong end of a lot of little decisions which meant that I got the least cubes on almost every round.  It just felt like I was in a hole for the entire game and didn't have a chance.
Maybe it was the set-up.  This seems to have a massive effect.  Or maybe it was that I started off being the last player.

An entertaining resource collection game in the Settlers mould that looks as though it will guarantee a close finish. Nothing particularly new in the mechanics but the sum is much greater than the parts. Rating more likely to rise than fall with more plays.

Settlers type game without negotiation which I favor.  Initial placement of tiles can mean the difference from winning and losing.  Very important part of the game.  Game keeps all players involved throughout the game.  Most games are very close in final scoring.

Resource collection game.

The game starts with an initial setup phase where you are positioning your huts in order to have potential access to resources, in a fashion similar to Settlers of Catan.

Then the real game starts.  You need to obtain resources as they are used for: buying seats in the Keythedral (your main source of victory points), upgrading your huts to houses (to get even more resources), building fences (to block other players), to buy law cards (rule-bending power cards), and to bid for turn order.

The bidding in the turn order phase is interesting in that it's once around, you bid with your resources, and the final player needs only match the highest bid.  Plus the winner of the bid pays the other player who made the highest opposing bid.  Then you actually select who goes first, which means you can keep the first player position at your end of the table for a long period of time potentially (going is first is VERY important).

The placement of workers determines which resources you will get (similar to Caylus), and always leads to someone getting screwed over (thus you want to go first as often as possible).  Then the action phase consists of buying or trading with your resources.  Then repeat.  It should be noted that screens are used (similar to Tigris & Euphrates) so everything is hidden (specifically resources and victory points).

The game doesn't sound all that original but it works very well with 2-5 players, is highly strategic and cutthroat, and everything works together exceptionally well.  I have to admit I overlooked this title for quite sometime, but am very glad I finally picked it up and played it.  If you like games like Caylus, you'll definitely like this one.

Interesting Euro; players compete for limited resources and use them to buy seats in church that translate into victory points. Reminds me of Settlers in some ways, but there's no trading and it's not as good.

I dig this game.  Lots of stuff to do, lots of fun bits, just a fun time for me.  Beware though, placement of your cottages is huge!  Always give new players a reminder to try not to build with access to only 1 or 2 tiles or this game will be ruined for them.  Theres a lot I like about this game!  My only complaint is the Law Cards are too varied in power.

I was really excited to play this, as I love Settlers and this is lauded by many as "Settlers without luck." Well, I prefer to call it "Settlers without fun." I played with 2 experienced players and another novice. Throughout the game I just never felt as if I was doing much. There was no excitement (even when seeing which resources I would get) and no joy. I'm really bummed, as I wanted very much to have this game be my next "must have".

Set-collecting via a ruthlessly competitive worker-placement arena. Upgrades are generally used to do down your neighbour rather than enhance your own yield, and random ability cards increase the combative elements further. It's a streamlined, attractive design, with great art, and a fun, harsh experience.

RATING: 5
A game about resource collection and expenditure.  Put workers in fields to obtain resources.  Later spend the resources to purchase a VP tile, to upgrade a house, to build/destroy a fence or to purchase a card.  Once you take a card, you may take no more actions for that round.

Definitely a screw factor in the worker/production phase and with the fences.  If at all possible, I strongly recommend against having a house connected to only 2 fields.

The cards provide a decent strategic aspect.  Some of the cards are very good while others are very meh.

In the "short" 3 player game I played, we all ended up having a similar amount of VP tiles except for the last 12 VP tile (36, 38, 40 in VP tiles, not counting the last one taken).  This was even though 1 player was clearly outproducing the other two of us.  Kind of odd – we're not quite sure why he didn't win.  The fact that our scores came out so close except for the last tile seems to indicate that the variety of our different paths and choices didn't have a big effect on our final outcome.  That sounds like a big negative to me.

There's a fairly significant disadvantage to purchasing the last tile in a row.  I wish this was mitigated somehow.  As it stands, to me it seems far better to pass on purchasing the last tile in a row and save your resources for the next row.

I do like how there's an inherent shift in demand as the game progresses and players move up the VP tile rows.  For example, wood and stone are highly desired early on but are not on any tiles after row 3.  The downside is that everyone needs generic resources after row 3 to purchase goods, like iron, stained glass and gold.  So even though the demand shifts a little, it's not all that significant.

Really, I just didn't enjoy this game all that much.  The screw factor is more annoying than anything, largely because sometimes there's just nothing you can do.  You are screwed.  Learn it, live it, love it.  I just don't think the screwage fits all that well with the rest of the game.

An okay game.  Would play again but not my first or second pick.  Just not that interesting.  While seemingly significant at the time, the decisions aren't particularly deep and it's pretty difficult to effect much of a long-term strategy.  Better than Key Harvest, but not so enjoyable that I'd urge you to play it.  If you can, fine.  If you can't, fine.  You should be able to live either way (hopefully).

1st play: Breese is amazing.  Yet another game, and yet another hit.  I liked this one a lot.  It has elements that feel like settlers, and I mean that in a good way.  The resource generation and building of cities.  I'm amazed at how tight and slick this game is.  Breese hasn't quite unseated Vlaada, but he's up there with Uwe for me now.  Streamlined, simple mechanics and deep gameplay.

2nd play: Still a solid experience.  Knowing what angles to take made this game play even faster the second time.  The cards, now that I know them, are less confusing, but felt more brutal and crippling this time.  This game is as mean as they come.

I'm giving this some points for the beautiful art, unique workers, etc.

It's a good game, in a sense, but it's SO nakedly a cube-efficiency game for 2p that it is sort of not that fun.  If you play significantly better (like my wife) you may well come out only 2 points ahead.  Too balanced?  The cube=>vp conversion is perhaps too obvious.  Still, the art is lovely, the tile-laying then "worker placement" is interesting and unusual.  I could go a bit lower, but I'll be kind.

A better gameplay version of Catan. It's more involve and interactive ( due to the use of fences) than the standard Catan game.

The tile placement at the start of the game plays a big part in the final outcome of the game. Resources are scarce, and competition for those can be fierce. The game requires a lot of planning, and yet it is easy to feel out of control.

The art is very quaint, more than you'd expect from a game with such tight competition.

Fourth game of the Key series by Richard Breese. Another very nice resource management game that feels very different than all the rest.

I would like to play this game more. Medium to Heavy Auction/Bidding game. Similar to Blue Moon City in the sense that you are making/buying seats in the "house". Fairly easy to teach, a bit forgiving in the beginning of the game. Law Cards are a bit useful than one might think. "Lying-low" in the beginning and building up resources is a good strategy. So that you can then buy more of the expensive seats.

No rating here again. We wanted to try this game after enjoying Keyflower so much. But whereas Keyflower is a simple auction game with some tableau building , Keythedral is an overwrought ( I think I use that term too much but it is perfect to describe these games that are way more complex than they need to be) game with so many rules that the rule book ( we had at least) needed two columns each page to fit them all in. Plus the components and art were so far off from Keyflower that it hardly seems possible that they came from the same designer and publisher.

The board layout is similar to settlers wherein you have cottages (which can be upgraded to house) that can benefit from the land surrounding it.  No die roll, just who gets first choice to move a worker out of the hut and into an area of choice beside it.  It's a good game, can be some backstabbing (with fences and first choice).  Enjoyed it.

beautiful components.  i think the screw yourself factor with initial placement is overstated.  go where the resources are, avoid number duping, REALLY avoid number duping with the guy to your right.  i still think veteran players have a big advantage, and an uncool one, in that they will be more familiar with the law deck and the keythedral tiles.  i would rather play with both of those face up.  i'd also rather play with 1 less law card than the number of players instead of a fixed 2.  this game presents illusions of confrontation, but it's really just helping yourself.  the blow to it for me is that there just don't seem to be any big bang type elbow-dropping maneuvers possible.  i want the ability to make cooler choices.

Ez a 2. key, amit kipróbáltam. A Key Marketnél egyszerűbb. A kezdőjátékos mechanizmus elég eredeti, mégsem tetszik, mert beragadhat a játékossorrend, ha valaki mindig magának akarja a 2. helyet. Mi ugyanis azt számoltuk, hogy a 2. helyen ülni a legjobb, ráadásul ez az egy hely, amit tartósan fenn is tarthat magának valaki (bár elég nagy összegért érdemes lemondani róla). A kártyák talán túl erősen nyúlnak bele a játékba. A munkások kiküldési mechanizmusa tetszik, aki szereti a konfliktust, annak ideális lehet ez a játék:) Kicsit erőltetettnek érzem a hosszabb-rövidebb játékmódot. Nem rossz játék, játszom is még vele szívesen, de kedvenc nem lesz.

Choosing your setup was OK.  Better than Settlers!  However. players are at the mercy of a random tile flip.  If you draw water, water, water, water... it starts to feel a little repetitive.    

Without the law cards, the game would be missing something.  However, some of the law cards are wildly overpowered and make planning a joke.  I find it offensive that one of the law cards allows just one player to choose the order of play for that round.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This has a nice mix of game mechanics.  The board is modular with the players choosing how it is set up through a blind choice.  The game offers tough decisions, a little bit of a screw factor, resource management and action points determined by your resources.  

For those of you looking for a modular board with similarities to Settlers of Catan, but with more depth, this may be your best choice.  I think it is really underrated and should be tried by more gamers.  Beautiful artwork doesn't hurt either!

[person=134]Mr. Breese[/person]: you sir, are a bit-head.

That term usually refers to programmers (and assembly ones at that), but I'm using it to describe your obsession for using lots of [i]bits[/i] in your games.  The pile of counters, tiles, cubes, cylinders, squares, circles, and chimpanzees (okay, they're not really in the game) was a bit overwhelming at first glance.  You are also very fond of player screens.  That's neither here nor there, except for the fact that I [i]cringe[/i] when I actually have to bend the tabs.

[i]Keythedral[/i] is almost two separate games.  When I examined the picutres, I was excited to think about building this board as the game progressed.  If you haven't read the rules, then you should know this: the first "game" is to construct the board [i]in its entirety.[/i]  If you "play" (build) poorly, then you will severely hurt your chances in the second "game" that is played upon it.  However, a working knowledge of the second game is required to do well in the first.

The second (and the actual) game is a careful blend of resource management, and tactical optimization.  Usually, you want to perform those actions that help you to purchase seats in the Keythedral, which are equivalent to victory points.  The self-proclaimed "strategic" variant of the game allows you to see the resource costs of every seat in the Keythedral ahead of time.  At the moment, I prefer the standard variant, and find that I still have to be strategic in my preparations.

However, there is also a considerable amount of confrontation: you can position your workers and fences such that another player may not be able to place her own workers.  Not being able to place a worker means you won't be collecting as many resource cubes.  Turn order can be a decisive factor.  An auction is held to see who will [i]choose[/i] the starting player in the next round, which can foster a bit of a breakaway leader problem.

After having stated these observations, [i]Keythedral[/i] is marvelous.  Playing it in some ways resembles a good computer Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game.  There is plenty of confrontation, resource management, and climbing a "tech tree" (in this case, the tiers of seats to purchase, and how you "upgrade" your huts into houses) on your path to victory.  I'm a big fan of RTS games, and also of [i]Keythedral.[/i]

[person=134]Mr. Breese[/person]: you sir, are also a genius.

After tiles were laid and goods were yielded for the first time I realised that tile laying sets the tone for the rest of play. And I was screwed. First timers; trial this stage in a dummy game up to yield and then start again. Looking forward to game 2.

Second game some years later and I really like this one. A very clever balancing act with options for screwage.

I really like the resource allocation in Keythedral better than that in Settlers, since no die rolls are involved.  The resource tiles are laid out at the beginning of the game, in turn, by players, and the way resources are obtained is again without luck (except for that of hoping your opponents don't notice that you screwed yourself in getting a particular resource at the beginning of the game).  No trading, and there the pews that you build to obtain victory points all have different requirements.  The 2-player option also works very well.

Load up the buildings, throw down the cubes, throw down the initial 4 tiles. Randomly pick a start player. Each player pulls a tile from bag, places it properly, then places a cottage. Once all finished with board layout, worker placement begins. Start player places #1 work order on number corresponding to the cottage/house from which they want to send a worker. All other  players then move workers from the same cottage/house number. When all finished 2nd player picks another number. Rinse, repeat until all work orders have been placed. Collect resources. Spend resources (in turn order). Start player marker is passed to the left. Once around Auction is run for start player marker. Auctioneer can take highest offer and give the marker or pay equivalent amount to offerer to keep the marker. Keeper of the marker then gives the marker to the person he wants to  go first. Place workers, etc. Repeat until last building tile is bought from keythedral. Yay!

I liked the Settlers of Catan-like tile laying and resource generation. The method of putting your buildings between the tiles and placing workers next to those buildings works quite well. The fact that point-scoring only happens at the "keythedral" and goes from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 point tiles with a Fresco-like acquisition didn't work for me.  Overall, it seems decent good as a shorter, lighter game but the end can fall really flat.

EVERY Resource-Dice is 2 Points worth. Don't pay 2 Points to be Player Nr. 1! In one Round you loose 1 Point, in one Round you win 1 Point. This is not exiting. It is important in the beginning to make citys (1 black, 1 brown dice). You have to do it. There is no strategy in the game.

After just one play I have to give this game an 8. Simple rules and easy to explain but it should really take a while to get good at this game. I really like the law cards, they add a needed extra spice.

081027: Lowered to 7. Very well designed, but the lack of eye-candy and rather dry game play makes me pick other games in the same weight category instead, e.g., Pillars of the Earth, Stone Age, or Princes of Florence.

Resource production & blocking can get harsh--seems likely to break down into diplomacy & king-making.  Not sure if it's a good idea to place your own cottages adjacent to one another.  BAD RULE: a cottage/house is "killed" and removed from game if other players surround it with fences (obviously, threats of "killing" increase the diplomacy aspects & length of game).

RATING: 7
Very much enjoyed my first playing of Keythedral; it has one of the more enjoyable building challenges I've played.  Cottages -> Workers -> Produce -> Crafts -> Points within the Keythedral: the progression (and timing) is tricky and offers plenty of direct interaction with your opponents.  Curiously, the art isn't necessarily to my taste, but I was genuinely surprised by the appeal of the components, once I'd seen the game up close.  Recommended!

 A tough "worker-placement"-esque resource collection game. tough decisions from the outset with the initial deployment of huts and fields. turn order was brutal and worth more than most people bid on it. we never deployed a single fence and that was probably a mistake. The law cards were powerful but with one exception not too powerful. All-in-all, a good game and one I'd happily play again but not anything I need to own.

Se trata de obtener más puntos de victoria que tus oponentes contruyendo una catedral. Para ello deberás comprar asientods en la catedral. Esos asientos cuestan recursos que puedes obtener en el mercado o mediante el uso de tus trabajadores sobre el terreno, en una mecánica parecida a la que utiliza colonos de catán. Hau también unas cartas de "leyes" que permiten realizar accioens especiales. Por ultimo, puedes bloquear la generación de recursos en determiandas zonas a tus contrincantes.

Juego muy bueno. Me ha encantado. Lo tenía ganas porque había oido hablar muy bien de él.. y efectivamente, vale cada elogio.

My initial reaction to the game was that this is Settlers on steroids.  But it's not.  I like the various elements -- the tiles and cities, the cube exchange for points, and even tactics of which number to pick.  However, when you put it all together, the sum of the whole is less than the sum of the parts.  I wish I knew why because I want to like the game.

While I certainly didn't feel like I was building a cathedral, I liked this game.  The initial set-up matters a LOT later on, which is tough for first-timers.  The cards added good twists to the gameplay.  So did the hidden building requirements for the upcoming rounds.  Overall, it was fun and I'd like to play some more.

A very abstract, resource/cube management game with no theme whatsoever related to building a cathedral. Nonetheless, a decent one. Faint shades of Catan but better.

About the only Richard Breese title that I can stomach.

Second play after 7 years. It's decidedly meh. You're stuck playing the same board the whole game. Cube manipulating exercise. Worker placement before Caylus defined the genre.

I'd been thinking about this one for a while, but always balked at paying $60 for a used copy on EBay.  Well, on vacation in Delaware, I happened upon a sealed, new copy of the Pro Ludo edition at Days of Knights, in Newark.  Snagged it for $50, and felt a thrill run up my leg.  This is an interesting little game, and a nice addition to my favorite genre/mechanic (worker placement).  On the one hand, it's not super-deep: deploy workers, gather resources, buy seats in the Keythedral with said resources, repeat until seats are gone, and high values win.  On the other hand, there are two maddeningly brain-burnish aspects to the game: the initial board build, and selecting the order of the cottages to release workers.  In both instances, it's all about trying to sequester resources just for yourself, and sequencing moves to block your opponent most while reaping the rewards.  Can be difficult to calculate sometimes with two - with more it might set your noggin' on fire.  So far, Ashar isn't loving this one as much as she might, I think she just needs some time to get the early game right.  It does often seem if you do poorly in terms of initial board positions, it might be hard to recover without ultra-shrewd gameplay (if then).  I like this better than Reef Encounter, because it's far more brutal.  The art on this one is completely charming and lovely, too - great components.

RATING: 6
A good game design that really shows its age. Probably the most important decision you make is in your choice of opening positions. All other decisions branch off from there, and if you find yourself cut off or your choices limited early on in the game, you will likely never recover. If you like very analytical, pure information abstracts, you will probably like this game. I don't. Sold.

I've played this enough now that my 8.5 rating feels solid. This is a solid game. The only real problem I see, is in the initial placement of tiles. If players aren't careful, and fully aware of the rest of the game, they can be in store for a really frustrating game. My son did this on our last play and while we were all garnering 6,7 and 8 resources each round, he regularly only recieved 3. ouch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A rather cut-throat economic / building / resource management gamers' game. If players aren't careful to keep track of how many Keythedral seats others are buying, at least in general, a runaway leader can capitalize on other players working against each other, but only so long as the leader avoids entering the fray. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't like "take that" in games or whose feelings are easily hurt, and I especially wouldn't recommend this game for younger children who may not be able to follow the many possibilities in each phase and/or have the required attention span to stick it out for the whole game, even if they're way behind. But for adults who aren't afraid of a little vinegar, Keythedral is an excellent way to make 60 to 90 minutes seem to fly by. The two-player variant isn't quite as satisfying, but even then, I would probably only turn down a game in a time crunch.

Surprisingly fun.  My only gripe with this one is that towards the end of the game, it seems to matter less what *types* of resources you're collecting as *how many* resources you're collecting. Still, the placement of the huts and the order in which they send out the workers is important. And is it me, or are fences only very rarely used? Fun anyway.  UPDATE: It's me.  Or rather, it's my playing group.  Played again with more cutthroat players and fences are DEFINITELY not underused.

Pretty good, but not great.  I really like the method of resource collection, with lots to think about as far as managing your cubes!  However, I often feel it's a crap shoot as to whether anyone really has much control over which cubes they get and how well they match up with the building blocks of the cathedral.  It often seems that the game boils down to who can get a few decent law cards that help them at opportune times.

This really is a very nice game. It is not too tricky to learn making it very accessible to most gamers.

The game looks good enough to eat when set up to and is beautifully produced.

Resource management game of the ol' 'obtain colored cubes, trade them for better colored cubes, and trade those for victory points' variety. A couple of elements bothered me. The face down victory point markers made it impossible to plan for what you would need at the end. Also, the 'take that' law cards add a level of choas that the game doesn't need. Nothing special. Since superceded by Caylus.

Settlers meets Caylus.  I really enjoyed this one and can see myself wanting to play again soon.  There are many fluid aspects to this game where it can be a little difficult to determine what exactly your best course of action is.  The bidding for the start player seemed artificial to me, but it is definately needed.  After one play, I really hope the game doesn't boil down into the first phase (cottage/tile placement) with the rest of the game just a race, I think not, but I do have that fear.

Only one play so far, but I like.  It's pretty basic, stripped-down resource management without *too* much luck involved.  My initial reaction is that one might get screwed by the randomization of the 10- and 12-point tiles if one buys the "wrong" goods.

Long terms strategies are hard to visualise on first playing, and the distribution of VPs across tiles tends to encourage simple turn optimisation approaches, even more so with the full compliment of 5 players.  Like his other designs, I suspect more plays will reveal a strong player count sweet spot and that the game is in fact less tactical than it appears on initial plays.

Further plays are suggesting that the sweet spot lies between 3 and 4 players and is in fact neither of the two.  I continue to prefer 3 player games however.

Reminds me strongly of Settlers, but Keythedral allows more player control over resource collection (no inter-player trading, though).  Keythedral is more strategic while Settlers is more social, if you will.

Keythedral is a solid game that I think of as "Roads & Boats Lite".  The few playings I've had have all been favorable, though playing with five players and the short version of the game makes it end too quickly, in my opinion.  I think four is probably a good number for this game, as it allows conflict, but the game still lasts long enough that various wall strategies can come into play.  Recommended!

RATING: 8
This is a fine game. Some superficial similarity to Settlers, but it has a lot of meat on the bone that Settlers lacks. While the initial set-up is still crucial, and can hamper you all game long if played poorly, there are a lot of ways to manipulate things through building fences, auction for 'order' of worker choice and upgrading to cities. The resource generation phase of the game is very cagey and fun.

The limited cards available feel like they should make the game a little too chaotic (similar to the magic cards in Aladdin's Dragons), but for whatever reason they don't feel that way in play (for me). You can figure out a way to make all of them benefit you, but it is a bit of a gamble when you purchase one. I enjoy the way the action round develops. 

The greatest advantage in this game over Settlers (besides incredible components) is that the player interaction is so much more conducive to clever play. First of all, there is the whole auction round for turn order/marker placement, then there is competition for limited resources, and finally there is the race for who purchases which points first. Very fulfilling.

Keythedral is a very cut-throat game. If you'd rather have your bad breaks come from luck: play Settlers. If you'd rather suffer due to another player out-clevering you: play Keythedral.

RATING: 7
This is a really neat little game by Breese which offers a very interesting blend of mechanics, decisions, and fun (not to mention beautiful and unique art!). In the vaguest of senses this game reminds me of Settlers, but I think that's more the theme than the actual gameplay, which really has nothing in common with the Teuber classic as it incorporates no trading, and is more of a game of resource management and timing. Keythedral focuses mainly on maximizing your initial placement, looking for chinks in the armour of your opponent's placements, and then manoeuvreing your way around the board set either by winning the start player auction, or by erecting fences in the right place at the right time. The game is only medium weight, but the actual placement at the start of the game is so important that it feels like a newbie player would end up in serious trouble in short order. I love the surfeit of 'screw you' going on in this game, while many Euro games are content to let players go about their business with only occasional interaction this title forces you to get in each other's faces with great regularity, which makes it a refreshing change of pace. The only thing I really don't like about this is the single-minded nature of the game, and the fairly stagnant state of affairs on the board. Your initial placements are where you're going to be for the entire game. While the different player order can spice things up and while changes can occur via house upgrades and fences, the general feel of the game is a little stagnant. That seems to be hurting the replay value as this is now down to a 7 from an 8; granted, it's taken me quite a number of plays to get here, but it does show that the game has a ceiling.

And yes, play with the advanced rules (all seats start face up, still can only buy from current row) as they make the game much more interesting. I also like this game at the lower scale, too many players means the game runs at turbo speed and you get very few rounds of playing in.

This game involves bidding to be the start player in each round.  Clockwise from start player, pick a number.  Workers leave that numbered house to enter a field (no mor than one per) for work.  Once all houses have been picked, each worker produces a single resource cube.  Resources are used to purchase victory point tiles.  They can also be used to upgrade hovels to houses (to send more workers), build/dismantle fences, trade resources, upgrade resources to crafts, or buy a law card.  Law cards allow a player to gain an advantage.

RATING: 6
Keythedral is everything Settlers of Catan should have been. The game is easy to teach, plays smoothly, has lots of player interaction even if you don't manage to score a lot of resources in a round, and knows a definite point where the game ends. And that all without that bane of modern games: the die. There is not much room for long-term strategic planning (save for when you are building up the playing area), but the decisions you have to make still require some thought. 

If there is any criticism to this game, then it would have to be that after numerous games it seems a bit bland. It is a simple gather-resource-and-build-engine, where the value of the resources can be doubled for every keythedral tile you buy. Therefore it doesn't matter whether you buy these tiles early or late in the game; you get the same bang for the buck. Interaction occurs predominantly through taking up resources before someone else can; gates are as quickly demolished as they are built; cards are sometimes quite artificial and weak, with a few powerful exceptions. There is some interesting stuff going on with the initial placement, but it remains a constant throughout the game thereafter. Keythedral remains a good and friendly game, but seems to have some superfluous mechanisms, causing it to lack a certain 'bite'. Downgraded from 8 to 7, where it will remain indefinitely.

[b]UPDATE[/b]   I'm not really sure the '7' is warranted, really. After giving the game a go again, and carefully positioning my numbered tiles in such a fashion that I would in many cases pick resources in a field [i]before[/i] the player on my left could, the tactical manoeuvring in the beginning seems to have lost a considerable amount of value. Of course the starting player can change so you yourself can be blocked by the player(s) to your [i]right[/i]. Hence the use of fences becomes rather predictable too, yaddayaddayadda. I found myself wondering what Keythedral's appeal now was, and that wasn't a great deal.

I was really excited about Keythedral since it looked like a game I would enjoy.  That being said, too much of the game is decided based upon initial placement.  From that point onward, it is just repetition where the player with the best placement seems to just stay ahead.

Rating is after 1.3 plays with three players each game.  This one has been described as "Settlers on steroids."  This may well be an accurate description.

RATING: 5
To a casual observer, this looks like a game about turning in cubes for points. However, it's really a game about extremely competitive resource harvesting.

The stumbling block here is that doing poorly in the 5 minutes of board setup (whether due to inexperience, poor play, bad luck, or the conspiracy of others) hoses you pretty hard for the rest of the game - and similarly, someone who gets a sweet setup initially will have a much easier time of it thereafter. If the game were shorter, I wouldn't mind so much, but as-is, it can feel (correctly) like you've already lost in the first 5-10 minutes of play.

I'm willing to give the game another try or two. I suspect our playgroup is underusing fences, and changing that ought to improve things somewhat. We'll see.

 The game combines a lot of mechanics from some of the most popular designer games and puts them into a good experience that works.

There is some luck factor that may/may not go away a bit after some more plays as it's tile turning and everyone is in the same boat. 

The art work and components are top notch. I recommend this for anyone who's into settlers, princes or even puerto rico...

Like all the "Key" games, there are some original mechanics and ideas going on here... the initial setup phase really sets the stage for how the game will play out. This will make every game of Keythedral seem like a different puzzle and challenge.

Also, the competition for resources is handled very ingeniously. It all comes down to handling turn order well and knowing which of your areas to give turn order priority to. It's very clever.

However, I did find a lot more randomness than the other "Key" games I've played, which was a little surprising.

The amount of brain burn is very significant (especially with 5 players) when trying to determine your best turn order options. But several of the cards are very powerful and can quickly negate an exceptional amount of planning and work.

The cards are roughly on-par with the cards from Aladdin's Dragons (a "Key" game re-theme), but Aladdin's Dragons is a much lighter affair and the cards fit much better there.

The randomness of the cards is only amplified by the randomness of not knowing exactly what resources will be required in the future. (For example, you can guess/hope/gamble that the top-level point tiles will require gold, but then get completely shut out if none of them do.)

The best "Key" game so far, hands-down, is Keyflower... I'd readily suggest that one instead of this one.

Easily ten times the game that the Settlers are pretending to be, with a bit of worker placement, in a way similar to the one in Caylus.  The resources needed for building the Keythedral are changing throughout the game, making the game play out differently in each phase.  Play with building tiles and law cards face up, of course.

RATING: 6
Does feel at times like a luckless version of Settlers.  Having now played Caylus I see comparisons there as well.  Doesn't have a great story arc or anything, feels somewhat like Hansa in that regard.  Still, it's solid and I've enjoyed it, I need to get some more plays (with some more people) on this one.

I really like modular board games, but like Through the Desert, the setup to the game is over half the game.  It is really really important where you put your huts and near whom and what resources you can get.  Once you are used to the set up, the game is really cool, but that hurdle of having a horrid game because the hardest part is before the game even starts is pretty tough.

OMG I just played the first edition, and that is a totally separate game that is absolutely a 1.  If you ever open a copy, and see the Keythedral chairs marked 1-5, slap the game owner and pick another game.  Or if you are ebil, quietly hoard your cubes until you have enough to take all the remaining chairs yourself.  Let the people who can't do math waste cubes on the first two rows.

Going to rate a 6 after 1 4er game, but I think this will go up after I try it again.  The initial setup seemed very important.  Later I would win the bid for turn order marker and make the player on my right start...yet I still could not outproduce the other players.  This had to be a function of my initial placement.  Hopefully repeat playings will reveal more strategy outside of initial placement.  Contrary to what others wrote, the random law cards did not really swing the game too much...so no problems with those so far.

A very interesting action drafting game with a neat little area control element. While I miss some of the elements common in the big three (Agricola/Caylus/Le Havre), I did appreciate maneuvering around building activation in order to collect resources. 

Two things bothered me about the game:
1) The green and brown were so similar in appearance that it was impossible for me to identify the differences thanks to my red-green colorblindness. This is a deal breaker and means I won't be acquiring a copy.
2) We all had very close scores at the end and I can't help but wonder if this was because of the way the game is designed. Games which ensure everyone has similar scores in the end kind of annoy me. However, I can't be certain of this until I play it further.

So overall I find it to be an interesting game, but not one I am going to seek out thanks to the deficiencies in my eyes.

Interesting &quot;Key&quot; game, themed on the building of a cathedral.  Players build a Settlers like board and draw resource cubes from the various tiles adjacent to their houses.  Cubes are spend in a variety of ways, but the big one is the components of the cathedral (which are purely victory points, from 1 to 5).  Plays rather quickly, leaving the feeling that some of the rules are irrelevant (who&#039;d build a fence?).  Played both the face down and face up versions of the VP tiles, and much prefer the face up variant.  Turns an okay game into a good game, deserving of a reprint.

based on a one 2p play. seems like Catan and Kingsburg getting together and had this game. plenty of hosing your adversaries for position of the resources that only one person can get. fast play easy/hard choices to make each round.

This game was very weird for me, but also enjoyable, despite some rules botchery on behalf of the teacher.  But like other games in the series, something feels like it's missing when I play.

Beyond the 'feeling' of the game, what you have is a solid euro with some great opportunities for interaction.

This game was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed my game of Keythedral. I played it for the first time on the big gameday on July 1st 2006. I found it to be somewhat similiar to Settlers of Catan, but without any dices and some minor differences.

Haven't played it since I got my own copy. I got my copy after I played my first game. Traded my copy due to the fact it never got it on the table.

Rules is a little bit more complex than Settlers of Catan.

Settlers without dice to some degree.  I really enjoy this game, both in terms of mechanics and the production quality.  The artwork is incredibly detailed and goes to efforts to illustrate game pieces that goes far beyond what you would expect from most games.  The weakness of the game is that the initial setup is incredibly influential for the rest of the game and so unless everyone playing is experienced the Keythedral it can lead to some very lop sided play.

Worker placement in painfully crowded areas, so many ways to block the other players. It's funny to build some walls between the opponent village and its field area by paying some cubes, but those cubes are also victory points at the end of the game. Seems to be quite impossible to place all the one player´s villages such way that none of them ever would be totally blocked - as the order of activating the village tiles changes every round, depending on which of the village numbers each player wants to prioritize over the others. Starting player of the round chooses the first village number to be activated, and each round there's also a chance to lose some victory point cubes in bidding about being starting player.
 
Building the board and placing the villages can be a sort of headache, as it can have a big influence on the rest of the game. Also, choosing the order of village numbers to be activated can cause some AP sometimes. 

There are some colour problems with game components - for example, some of the cube illustrations are not similar enough with corresponding cubes and players can be confused about them, as black and grey are very close to brown and so on... also, some colour choices for the modular board are a bit odd - why does the white board produce black cubes and whose idea was it to paint the forests brown?

Great game, nice designer. Putting together the board is as much fun as playing the rounds. The strenght of the game lies in the fact that every action has a snowball effect on the actions of others.

It's a very dynamic game that's great fun (law cards are usually very nasty)

Well this makes it a 3 for 3 for Mr. Breese.  Much like Reef Encounter and Aladdin's Dragons, your attention cannot sway too far off the game since there is so much to look out for and decide.  The initial terrain building is so crucial yet I'm hard pressed to give general guidelines because the ressource collection phase is difficult to plan perfectly.  Definitely make sure that you have all ressources to leave your options open.  Not too sure if the game can be one playing in a very specific way, there's a lot to be said about just hoarding the craft cubes (glass, gold and iron) since they offer the possibility of grabbing a high value tile in the end.  Even if you don't find something compatible, they retain their core value which is sweet.  There are lots of timing issues and tempo is crucial; you don't want to be trading with the merchant when a new row of tiles becomes open, you have to hold some goods in advance (and a few cards won't hurt).  Great great game.

I've only played this once, as a two player game, so these comments are based on that. 

Well, I like modular boards, so that's a plus. The way the modular board links with ongoing worker placement, and player interaction, is quite well done. I think the way worker placement is initiated in this game, and combined with the initial setup, is innovative and very interesting. I found there to be a "brain burner" element to that mechanic that was difficult for me to master. It would take several plays, at least, for me to start to get a feel for how the initial board setup impacts game play, and that feels like an important element of the game to me.

Other than that, the game is a fairly standard resource gathering / trading / upgrading euro game. It was, in my one play, very interesting and pretty fun. I thought the "interesting" outweighed the "fun" by a fair margin. I have a feeling that if I played it 10 times, I'd have had my fill.

[Tile-Laying, Resource Management] [4P:6, 5P:5] So far the only Breese design that I can tolerate. Keythedral still feels like it could use some tightening up. The most egregious offense comes from the Law Cards, which can be fearsomely powerful one turn and questionably weak the next. The laying of the workers and the parlaying of their efforts into resources is clunky in practice. Finally, the game feels very static and repetitive. It also feels much longer than it is, perhaps due to the lack of variety in the game narrative. Overall, a decent game, but I'm not likely to ask to play, let alone acquire a copy. (Thanks to Mr. Wilson Tan who loaned me his copy to try out. The full review is forthcoming.)

Keythedral is a fairly standard resource conversion game: collect resources, then turn them in for victory points. What sets the game apart from many other resource conversion games is how resource gathering works. There is lots of direct conflict because you can easily deny resources to other players. In fact, manipulating turn order in such a way to make this possible is probably the most important part of the game.

I like that basic idea and most of its execution, too. Unfortunately, there are a few issues that pull the game down a little. The different resource types are mostly interchangeable to the point that it doesn't matter that much what you get as long as it's a lot. The exact valuation changes a bit at different times during the game but it is only towards the end that it really matters. More grating, however, is that the (face-down) law cards are so variable in power and sometimes so ridiculously overpowered as to lead the precise planning and timing ad absurdum.

I think Keythedral is a very decent achievement for the time it was released. This has a somewhat "Catan" feel to it, but designer Breese clearly wanted to have a little more going on in his "trade resources for points" style of game and in that he had an achievement. Keythedral has some solid parts, including the modular board setup, agressive blocking for resources, and Law cards which add flavour.  I do think now 15 years later (at the time of this comment) Keythedral feels somewhat out-dated and at points imbalanced.  Part of the game is blocking players from being able to get resources, but this can set them back quite a bit. Also, the game almost forces an early house strategy, if only to speed things up.  So if one player is going for house upgrades, every other player better follow suit. I think the worst part of the game are the imbalances between certain Law cards. Some do very little to the point of almost no effect while others played at the right time can grant a ridiculous amount of points. Some you can't use at all given one situation where others will set back other player in a rather cruel way. I'm surprised the game wasn't further balanced back then.  Anyway, I think Keythedral is a great example of a game that shows what had come before it and what possibilities are to come.  For an early 2000s game, it has merit and a place in the history book. I just don't know if I really enjoy the game that much to teach others again. A lot of the game can feel procedural and calculating.  If I want something cleaner, I'd go to Catan. If I want something more intriguing, I'd go to practically 100 other Euros that have come after Keythedral.

We played the shorter version, which was maybe a mistake as the game absolutely rushed to a conclusion after we figured out what we were doing, and it seemed a little bit too chaotic.

Interesting trade,buy, and build game.  takes a few plays to determine placement strategies, and understand the importance of foresight, and building fences.  Can move quickly at times, and if you get blocked out on too many fields you can watch the game get out of reach.  Absolutely beautiful components.

Update: Not a title the calls to be replayed.  the mechanics just don't blend properly for me.  This is a problem I am finding I have with Breese's games.  Not that they are bad, just they don't inspire.  Could be the group I play with? Maybe.

UPDATE: The largest problem with Keythedral is the lack of diversity in the resources. I don't ever feel that there really makes much difference which resources I gather as long as I get a lot.  
The game also feels pretty much over after the initial set up, and seems to run on auto-pilot thereafter.

1 play with 5 left me feeling depressed.  I placed second, but didn't feel I earned it, which is a big problem:  the initial set-up felt crucial, and as a group of newbies, some got it less right than others, and paid dearly.  I dislike games that feel like they "play backwards" i.e. you've effectively made most of your chief strategic decisions at the beginning, and the rest of the game is a long, slow, repetitive grind down to inevitability.  The law cards felt very imbalanced too, although playing with them open would help a bit, I think.

I greatly enjoyed my first playing of this game.  The theme and components are good, but it's the decision-making that really makes this game shine.  Deciding which workers to send out first in order to maximize your resources, while at the same time screwing your opponents, was fun - and this was all in a two player game!  

Now that I've played a 4 player game, my rating has gone up.  It is even better with 4, and the work order becomes an exercise in screwage and conflict.  YES!!!

After an introductory 2 player, I can see the comparisons to Settlers of Catan, and Keythedral fares much better -- no dice!  Typical euro mechanism of trading up resources and a little screwage (the fences!) plus the wildcard element of the law cards makes this a game I would like to revisit soon. The art makes for a board that is too busy and the cube colors are difficult to tell apart in some lighting (I'm looking at you, brown and purple cubes!)

Notably, one of the most beautiful games in my collection.  The strange resource allocation with the workers and the ordering of the numbered huts forms the core of the game, and it's a novel and enjoyable system - although some will find it too chaotic or too "gamey."  The law cards vary the play nicely and serve as an incentive for players to cut their actions short a la Klunker.  The second edition from Pro Ludo is the one to get because of its sturdy box, enlarged cathedral, and more sensible scoring.  This is Breese's best game yet [Edit: now eclipsed by Reef Encounter and Key Harvest].

After one play : the game seems a hodgepodge of a couple of other games. Not very streamlined. The game plays very slowly until it speeds up dramitically to finish in one or two turns.

The tiles are nicely illustrated, but too cluttered up. The color difference is annoying - black is dark brown and very close to brown. Multiple players were confused. Once the villages are builkt, the difference between the colors is hard to see. By working a quarry (white tile) you get a black resource cube - annoying.

An interesting game of resource collection. However, placing all of your cottages at the beginning of the game makes it difficult for new players to grasp the consequences of placement. I would like to try a variant where there's a round of resource collection after the first two placements. That way the last three placements would be made with the working knowledge of how resources are gathered.

Seems complex at first but plays really well.  There are a lot of dynamics involved, with little down time so one has to pay attention throughout the game.

In essence this is the same old stuff, getting ressources, convert them and build something (in this case the Keythedral) to get points. Reminds me quite a bit of Settlers, but it's a much nastier game.

I found it a bit boring, even though it's interesting, but takes too long for what it does. Also, there arn't many points to give, so that in my last games, 3 players had 42 points and there's no tiebreaker.

Fine game, but nothing I need to keep.

Is this game brutal or what? The law cards are terribly swingy, but the rest is at least decent. Hoseage is so common that pretty much everything you do screws someone over, intentionally or not. I won't want to play it often, but when in the mood for something really nasty, this fits the bill.

I like this game. It does look easy to get shut out of goods relatively easily but since the resource number priority rotates for worker placement you should be able to work around it at other times and others will get shut out.

[Initial Impression: 8]
I'm liking this one more and more.  Often compared to Settlers of Catan for what I consider to be superficial reasons, this is a far superior game that plays more smoothly and with many more meaningful choices.  The board is built up by each player placing a land tile and then a cottage, so you have some control over both the board layout and initial placement of your cottages.  Instead of being randomly determined, each land tile will generally produce one cube for one player on each turn, with players having to claim a land tile adjacent to their cottages/houses.  The way that players have control over the order in which land tiles can be claimed is a particularly interesting mechanism that is a central driver of the gameplay.  Much of the strategy comes in trying to determine the optimal choice for which set of numbered houses will be able to claim fields, so that you'll be able to produce the resource cubes that you most need (or prevent others from getting the ones they need).  Then, you have several choices of how to spend those resource cubes (upgrade cottages, obtain better cubes, claim victory points, etc.).  Fences can be used to block other players from claiming the land tiles you need, but they can always spend cubes to tear down the fence. The law cards add a hefty dose of uncertainty, but also some flavor, to the game - being able to claim a law card is a fairly strong incentive to drop out of the turn order early. The bidding mechanism for turn order is interesting, but also a bit of a drawback, as it can sometimes lead to one or two players monopolizing first and second turns for long stretches (they're able to earn more cubes by going early, and are therefore able to bid more to keep their early turns).  The game is extremely competitive, with a lot of interaction between players, and each turn feels extremely tense (especially with higher player counts).

RATING: 7.5
This game is everything Catan should be, and more.

It has a random tile board distribution, selection of home squares, resource production/collection, tight play, and lots of choices on how to spend the resources, as well as a variable turn order structure.

Add in beautiful art and colors, what's not to like?

Well, there is also the interactive ability to get to the resources first depending on dwelling order selection, and there is still the ability to be done out of the best starting position by incautious board layout.

But in general it takes everything that Catan had, and makes it more interesting, more challenging, less luck-based and more generally appealing.

An easy 7.5 on a first solo play (3-player), and likely to go higher with more plays.

遊戲設置:
1.每個玩家拿對應顏色的5個木屋板塊，10個工人圓片，三個圍籬，一個屏幕跟回合卡
2.在大市集圖版上，洗勻法律卡並面朝下蓋著放兩張到對應位置(兩人遊戲只使用一張)，把建築板塊放在對應的大教堂圖板上(短版用灰的，長版全用)，最年輕玩家為起始並拿走起始標記，根據人數使用對應的田園板塊(依造背面數字)
2*起始放四個1的田園板塊把教堂板塊圍起來，交叉相鄰(兩木兩石頭)，剩下的田園板塊洗勻，由起始玩家開始順時鐘放一個田園板塊跟放一個自己的木屋板塊，直到所有玩家放完5個田園5個木屋板塊
遊戲流程:
每輪有5個階段，遊戲進行到所有建築板塊被拿走
1.放工人 由起始玩家開始選擇一個數字放圓柱，接著每個人順時鐘對應數字木屋放一個工人到相鄰板塊(如果木屋升級到房屋則放兩個工人到兩個不同資源)，被圍籬隔或有人的不能放，之後照此流程由下一個玩家放圓柱，直到所有圓柱放完
2.收集資源 照順序每一塊有人的資源點拿一個資源，沒得拿就沒有
3.花資源 由起始玩家開始輪流以下7個動作選1直到所有人都pass 或是拿了法律卡的人要強迫停止動作
 a.付資源拿建築板塊 每一等級被拿完就開下一等，直到全部被拿完
 b.升級房屋: 花1石1木升級並選移動翻面
 c.建柵欄: 花1木頭建柵欄 阻止別人工人進資源板塊，如果有小屋板塊完   全被圍欄圍籬所有資源點，將該小屋板塊重放
 d.移除柵欄: 2個紅資源可移除圍欄，該圍欄被移出遊戲
 e.高級資源交易: 對應資源數目的資源交換高級資源2/白，3/紫，4/黃
 f.兩個任意資源換一個正常資源
 g.花一資源拿法律卡，影響他人的要馬上用，使用完棄掉
 h.Pass 如果再次輪到還是可動作
4.拿回工人 移除工人圓柱，蓋著補充新的法律卡，沒了不補
5.起始玩家換左手邊玩家，此時會有一輪方塊資源競標從新起始左邊開始，拿到起始的人只要付最高價就可得標，得標者決定起始玩家，如果不是競標尾家標到就付給競標尾家，不然就是尾家付給出最高價者
****遊戲在最後一個建築被蓋馬上結束，建築分數跟所以方塊分數，黃4紫3白2，其他1
*兩人時起始只用1木1石板塊，不用教堂，每一回合只有一張法律卡
**變體二 一開始建築全開

Wow.  Mr. Breese must have been in a bad mood (i.e pissed off) when he designed this game as it is as cutthroast as you'll ever find in a hardcore Euro game.  I like the balance of tactical to strategic play evident in this very tight planning title. I especially appreciate that one can always "come-back" with the right move at the right time.  Some players have problems with the Keythedral building aspect as it is a bit hard to plan for, but I don't see any serious error with it.  I rather like this game even though my tastes are usually opposed to the genre.

I've enjoyed my first couple of games of Keythedral. The tile set-up and the mechanics for placement of workers and collection of resources are so much more interesting (and less luck-based) than in Settlers of Catan. The other mechanics are less original but work well enough together. The full-length version is more satisfying, but it is nice to have the option of a shorter game.

RATING: 4
Very disappointed by this.  It has some significant knocks that have been mentioned here.  Don't pay attention to all the good reviews unless you like games where:

1 - The rich get richer.  Whoever controls the first player token will get the most resources, and thus have enough resources to even bid, and thus stay first
2 - The law cards make the game come down to a random draw as to who wins.  I've played this twice.  Both times, the law cards decided the outcome.  I'm not a fan of games that go 90+ minutes and are decided by a random draw of a card (see Goa, which is worse than Keythedral in this category)

I might give it one more go, but we will use the "Law Cards Face Up" house rule, never play with 5 players, and not allow the previous first player to be the first player the next turn.  This might make the game a little more balanced.

I finally picked up this game when I moved to Atlanta and I love it.  It feels like Settlers, but without the dice rolling.  This has both pluses and minuses in that you can pick the resource that you specifically need, but you can be forced out of something that you need at the same time (particularly if the player seated before you share the same field).  In Settlers, sometimes the odds are on your side and that 11-mountain hits 6 times during the game, here you don't get that luck and you may be forced to only get a specific resource on the turns where you go first.

RATING: 8
Excellent game with some fun dirty play. Very little like Settlers, a lot more like Caylus or really Caylus is similiar to this. Solid gameplay here, the auction can be quite important for timing and turn order. Initial set-up is quite important as it does not change once completed, this also means house placement is quite critical and very important to implement early on. Different strategies to explore makes this a great game with some replay, luck factor is quite low also. While it works for two it is mostly a 'tit for tat' affair.

I have only played this once, but I liked it a lot.  The game reminds me in some ways of Pillars of the Earth, but it's more complicated.  The first part of the game is one of the most difficult things.  You are setting up the board for the game, which will be different every time you play.  This is a factor of games I really enjoy; when the board is different every time.  It gives games a lot of replayability.  

The rest of the game is placing your workers (which is interesting and very different from a lot of other games; turn order matters a lot), collecting resources and buying points in the cathedral.  What complicates all this is law cards, of which there are only two available each round regardless of the number of players.  These can only be used in specific phases, and some are much better than others depending on when they are used in the game, so knowing the optimal time to use them is important.  

All told, it's the most interesting worker placement game I've played excepting Egizia and Tinner's Trail.

Oh, we send our workers out to tiles and use the cubes they gather to build the Ketheydral and earn points? It's like Caylus!

Well, yes. But it isn't immediately apparent that you will have to screw your neighbor out of being able to place all of her workers. And then you'll need to manipulate who the starting player is so that you can continue the screwage.

My standard opening remark when explaining Keythedral is: This looks like a nice friendly cube-pushing game, but it's not. It's nasty and you will hose someone. You can't help it.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2014)

I have liked every game I have played from Mr. Breese, however, we didn’t finished our only play of Keythedral, so the jury is still out on this one. I think I will like it, and it can even go higher up in my ratings with more plays.

It seems, assembling the map is very important, but it is very hard the first time to see how to take advantage of this,  so I think the game has a (somewhat) steep learning curve. The rules are very easy to teach and learn and the game is fluid enough (without AP players) that I dig the game. It has a lot of “take that” moments, so you have to play this with players who have thick skin. I’m worried about the power level of the cards, some seem to be very powerful, other not so much. 

The art is pretty, however the combination of colors are awful, the green and brown are way too close to each other, also, the black wooden token represent stone from the white mountains :S.

I need to play again to re rate and re comment, I hope to play again soon.

RATING: 10
A resource gathering game where you are partially at the mercy of your competitors.  The cut-throat action is envigorating, and the race to get the final 10's and 12's is well designed.  I disagree about the "imbalance" of the law cards.  All know what the law cards can do, and allow others to out-strip them in this commodity at thier own risk  (by the way, giving them more resources to use to do things like determine the first player of next round, a _crucial_ component of the game.)

Update:  I have now played this about a half-dozen times, and it has made it to my ranks of "Will almost always want to play this, even over eating or sleeping." category.  So, not quite on par with sex.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After a couple of plays I decided to add my rating... and a few comments.

The game is basically two parts: Building the board and then production/building.  And the game can be lost in either part.

Players houses must be placed where they  have access to at least one of each type of resource or they are at a serious disadvantage and restricts their selection of builds in the second half of the game.

Selection of builds is almost totally dictated by the number of commodity cubes that a player gets each round.  Sitting back for a round or two collecting resources appears to be a common road to victory.  Being the person who buys the last tile in any Victory Point row appears to be a disadvantage and usually only talkes place when a player can immediately purchase another tile right away.

Lots to think about each turn, but for the most part seems very repetative.  Poor placement in the set-up phase can spoil the game for everyone.  A trading phase would have helped make this game much better.  One other thing that I have noticed is that turn order on the last round of the game is crucial for victory... the ability to buy first can be a huge benefit.

I own a first edition version and have enjoyed my playings, though I do agree that the scoring could be better. I've printed a copy of the 2nd edition rules and I'm eager to get this on the table again. UPDATE: I finally played with the 2nd edition rules and liked them quite a bit. I think the change in scoring of both the tiles and adding a value to the commodities really helps the game.

I really like Reef Encounter, and finding this on the cheap on eBay I had to get a copy.

I would like to play again to form a proper opinion though.

The possibility for direct player targeting in an optimization game rubbed me the wrong way. Why should I bother with planning ahead when the best plan can more or less randomly be destroyed just because I end up being hit the most and collect the least resources. Add to this a noticeable luck factor in the draw of law cards which differ seriously in their strength and I'll be passing on this one in future.

The building of the Keythedral mechanic is fairly dry, but the action in this game is all in sending your workers into the fields to gather resources. A nice level of variety with the effects of law cards and fences and houses. Plays quick and holds my attention throughout.

I think the artwork is very nicely done, much more attractive than the standard German Vohwinkel/Menzel stuff.  Having everything done individually (different workers on each token) is very nice.  Of course, all that really matters is how the game plays.  It is enjoyable and can be quite cutthroat.  It seems better if you play with face-up law cards (makes the chaos a little more manageable) and face-up building tiles as well, to facilitate planning.  As it is, it pretty much feels like a race, making turn order and initial placement very important.  There's nothing really all that exciting or new, and as far as "building a cathedral" games go, I think I may like Pillars of the Earth or Caylus more.

Traded away.

It has some neat concepts, but this game allows you to be effectively eliminated without being able even to leave the table.

Fun, relatively light resource management/worker placement/ building game. Initial building placement can be crucial for a successful outcome. Also, planning in advance for upcoming building tiles can make the difference in the later stages of the game. The Law cards add a bit of randomness and unpredictability. A good combination of strategy and luck and in a nice fun package. Are work it great.

Fun game. Initial placement of the tiles is important, but also deciding the order in which the workmen get to the fields will determine what you can do. The bidding for the start player is special and until the end of the game, it is often better to give the starting right to your right-hand player when you win the bid. More to it than you would expect after a first play. Only minor point are the rather unbalanced law cards.

The missing link between Catan and Caylus? Just a tentative rating after one game, everyone's first so we didn't play the fences aggressively enough. Gotta try with scoring tiles open next time.

Okay.  A little too dry and calculational.  The whole game comes down to a little area control puzzle where you try to get more cubes than the other people.  And cubes are so tight that if you waste one it can cost you the game, so that's pretty annoying.

The artwork is cute, and it's fun, it's pretty mediocre.

The 1st edition seemed ok but underwhelming to me.  The 2nd edition is much, much better since the scoring has been revised for a more balanced method.  The game still heavily favors more experienced players because (1) the setup phase is important and (2) the emphasis on knowing what cubes are required for the high-valued tiles...

RATING: 8
Typical brainburner game from Breese.  Decisions abound from which cottages/houses to provide workers and in which fields to place them to when to build parts of the cathedral or trade in cubes to plan for higher scoring pieces of the cathedral later in the game.  Other decisions also abound in the game to add even more alternatives and decisions.

Keythedral is a particulary outstanding Euro game.  The method of gathering resources from fields by placing cottages on the intersections feels very much like Settlers.  The auction for turn order and the use of the cottage/house numbers are an ingenious way of forcing people to plan their strategies carefully and weigh their decisions.  The law cards, trading posts and the victory point tiles are all ingeniously and elegantly designed.  The game is also beautifully produced with great variety in the artwork on the individual pieces.  Although the individual mechanics of this game are not completely original, the game as a whole is unique and well-crafted.

I hold this game in the same kind of esteem that the BGG masses seem to hold Puerto Rico.  This is the best resource management game I've ever played.  Shutting your opponents out of the fields is such a great feeling.  The law cards (they should be sold FACE UP) add just enough randomness to this game to keep every turn different. 

Juliet Breese's art -- every field, worker, and house tile has a different illustration! -- sets the bar at its highest for board game components.

Wonderful game.  I'm considering giving this a 10, but I'll hold it to a 9 now until I can play this more.

UPDATE:  9 --> 8.  No, I went a point in the other direction.  Played this a lot more, with 2, 3, and 4 players.  I still like it very much, but the game lacks the openness and potential for creative, risky play in the games I truly love.  This game puts you and your opponents in straight jackets and measures who can best wiggle free.  You win by outmaneuvering your opponent incrementally each turn.  As such, there's little potentail for wild, devastating plays; and each game tends to follow similar patterns.  There's a lot to be said for games like this (Puerto Rico is one such game), but an 8 is the highest rating I'd feel comfortable giving one of them.

I've wanted to play this for years.  Finally did.  It was just "ok" to me.  Seems like too much screwage for what it is.  Lots of blocking people out of getting their resources, etc.  But it was fine - just not that great.

Overlooked, I think, but worth looking into.  A good game of worker placement where the timing of when certain workers triggers makes or breaks your efforts.  The law cards are not utilized as much as I'd like, but the rest of the game gives plenty to chew on.

What a disappointment. I think it shows ALL THE DEFECTS of euro game. It is repetitive, it is dry, it is abstract. There is no significant decision after initial placement. Cubes which Keythedral accepts are just arbitrary. Colors of cubes almost doesn't matter, only number of them are important. Law cards are unblanced and annoying. It is full of screwing other players. No fun, no excitement. What a bad experience. I don't want to play this game ever again.

7 octubre 2005. after my first play i think is a very good game. All my friends agree with that apreciation. Interesting resource management game with some screwage. Nice and beautiful components. 
It is like SoC without trade between players and dice.
A good initial set-up is necessary and critical for not losing  from the begining (more iimportant than Settlers). However a good configuration doesn't guarantee the success.
UPDATE: november 13, from 8 to 9. Is may option right now. Very tense until the last action. In our last game, the score was 50, 49, 48, 41. Wow!
UPDATE 26-1-06: compared with AOS I need to rank only at 8.5

Caylus' predecessor.  The major difference is that tile placement is separate from earning resources by placing workers in Keythderal, while Caylus integrates the two nicely.  Gameplay in Keythedral is choppy and somewhat mechanical, while in Caylus there is a better flow and efficiency. Keythderal is a decent game, but has been bested by a similar newer game in every way. The slight draw here is the shorter playing time.

Accepted Trade July 8, 2009  (for a copy of Galaxy Trucker)
Arrived in excellent NIS condition.
July 24, 2009 - Punched and read through the rules. Have yet to play a real game but I can't stop thinking about how I'm going to approach it when I do.  I can't wait to play.

New players will suffer a bit from understanding the importance of good cottage placement but with some coaching they'll see what's up pretty quickly. Law cards are powerful but they don't feel like they represent all one drives for. Great resource engine to victory points game that places pretty quickly. The rules are relatively straightforward but feel a bit awkward to explain. One round of sample play makes everything very clear.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In a 2-player game everything depends on cottage placement next to forests at the beginning of the game. It's frustrating to see your opponent be able to get more brown and then upgrade to houses and get more resources every round. It's a slow snowball effect that is very unsatisfactory. I suspect the game plays better with 4. The 2-player game is extremely unsatisfying.

In this game players compete for resources that are used to build pieces of the keythedral.  You need to have the right resources to purchase the pieces that are for sale and you must plan ahead to buy the next pieces that come up.  Also, there is some conflict because only one cottage (or house) can send a worker to a given field tile.  Also, you can construct fences for even more conflict.  It is an interesting game, but it is not the best of its kind; however, the bits are pretty and its refreshing to see a little conflict in a eurogame.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Didn't like this at all with two players. Will try again with 3-4. Also, would definitely play with law cards face up and the entire set of Keythedral tiles exposed from the start of the game.

Played again with three players and tiles and law cards exposed. Slightly better but I think it would need four players to shine. Even then it's not a game for me. It feels like getting stuck in the mud and it's a grind to get through a game.

02/28/06 Played a three-player game once. A nice game that suffers from ugly and confusing art work. Iron cubes are white? Stone is black (?), but comes from a hex that's 95% white!? Same tile types have such variety that they can be mistaken for other types. I mistook a green food tile for a blue water tile at one point due to it having more blue water in it than green fields. The guy who did the art work should be horse whipped.

This is for me what Settlers of Catan should have been. Less random (no dice) and harder to master. I like the rule that you have to feed your farmers red wine in order to make them rowdy enough to destroy other players fences. Oh, and it's very neat that all the workers look different.

A very stream lined worker placement game, the mechanics are simple and quick to learn (the first and second round are usually enough).
Problems: the printing is suspect-some of the colours are less than clear; the cube colours chosen are also hard to distinguish (worse if you're colour blind).
Given how quick and flowing the game is, these flaws are annoying but ignorable.

Yep, they're right about this -- you can loose the game before it even starts. Lots of take-that elements that could turn some players off. Also I found that it was missing a bit of tension or meaningful decisions; half the game is spent selecting the order to put ressources on, collecting ressources, and removing your workers from the board. I enjoy the zero-sum aspect of ressource collection.

Like wow!  Magnificent mix of mechanics, player-interaction and screwage.  Initial placement is a crucial & enjoyable part of the game.  The bid is interesting because each round only one person wins it.  The winner determines which player is going to choose the first work-order marker.  Bidding correctly might just be the key to success as the placement of your workers determined by the order marker is how one gains resources.  Resources are tight and there are some tough decisions but nothing that'll make your brain explode.  There's a bit of controversy in my group (at least from me) whether the law cards should be face up or face down (I suggest the latter).  Looking forward to trying out the expansion.

A nice step up from Settlers... some luck is taken out, but it also takes time to understand the relative distribution of the victory point-offering tokens.  Have also experienced the game as very cut-throat... could make for bad blood (since there's so much opportunity for a person to screw another out by blocking off his workers).

Shaky rating. Surprisingly quick game, and there's always room for quick multi-player games with some meat on 'em. But this was so quick that it just seemed overly tactical. I wanted more planning. I don't think the Settlers comp works - the different color cubes are produced at roughly the same rate (not includng the fancy ones) so the values are nearly equal, and to the extent that they can differ, will be nearly static through the game. Maybe there's a little Settlers of the Stone Age thing going on, where black (meat) is more useful at the beginning, and red (ivory) at the end. But if there's enough of a gap there to get leverage out of, and enough time to do it, I'd be surprised.

Excellent little resource management game with a unique mechanism for determining turn order.  Balance is needed to win - do you invest in houses early on or go for the easy building tiles?  Always surprises me how quickly the game ends after the first few turns.  Great fun.

RATING: 9
In this game, you try to collect resources of several types.  You need to use these resources to buy seats in the Keythredral which translate to victory points.  You can also use the resources to upgrade your resource collecting ability or block your opponents.  The trick is knowing what to do when.

I like this game because there are many different choices in every round.  The game is beautifully illustrated.  It's one of my favorites.

The art feels a bit old. The components are normal. It's very similar to Settlers of Catan, without that much luck factor (yay!) but also without the negociation (woooh!).

I enjoyed it more than I expected. We bought it supercheap in a French shop, but I was not totally convinced. But I had fun playing it and it has deserved the right to stay in my collection.

I'm still unsure about the interaction. I think it's not really polished and somewhat crude.
-> Attacks with barriers are too direct. It's not easy to spend a cube (worth around 2 points) on that, and making the other spend 2 cubes is huge.
-> The law cards can be very unfair.

RATING: 6
Now tried with 3 and 5 players. I have a feeling that I'd like this most with 4 players. The scores are always very close. Actually too close, it is practically impossible to have big differences in scores. This naturally means that games are tight but it's not always rewarding when your optimum play is almost the same as semi-poor. A good example of a game where mechanics balance game too much.

RATING: 7
Lots of class here, with the meticulous artwork and plenty of wooden bits. But the game itself feels a bit lost somewhere between worker placement and economic. Despite the best intentions with a theme that has since been somewhat overworked, there's no real complement from the mechanics. The overriding need to resource is tedious, and the fiddliness of the tiles is disappointing (no wonder people make their own boards). The randomness of the Law cards is less than helpful, and I'm a little concerned that it's too easy to gang up on one player.

Further Thoughts - Despite all the negativity, it's not totally terrible, but there are too many frustration-factors here.

New Pro Ludo edition (German version).  Having not realized that an English version was forthcoming, I'm stuck with the German one.  No major problem, but the Law Cards are all in German, unfortunately.

Played once only so far.  Early indiations are that this is every bit as solid a game as the high rating indicates.  Additional play is required to fully grasp the balance between being proactive and reactive, knowing when to antagonize and when to cooperate.  There's a lot going on, and planning ahead is not only important, it's very difficult.  Overall a winner of a game.

RATING: 4.5
It's okay, I bought it because it was only 10 euros.

The theme doesn't grab me, but it does offer a few interesting decisions in the spending phase.

The worker placement phase is the most important part, but has a lot of AP and the though processes involved are very abstract and detached from the supposed theme of collecting lumber, food etc. - you are mostly thinking about whether you will get blocked if the workers get "activated" in the wrong order, which IMO distracts from the overall idea and setting 

Bought from Germany Summer 2007/ Traded/Sold 2010?

An interesting and very tactical set collection game but which has aspects that reduce the rating for me. The resource collection is quite chaotic and players can easily be starved of resources without doing much, if anything, wrong. The law cards introduce a random take that element and range from useless (if acquired at the wrong time) to game changing and targeted players have no defence. For me players do not have enough control over their own destiny.

Such a simple to understand,yet enthralling game. Our first game was all newbies and it flowed evenly and quickly with everyone competing.
This game can get nasty as resources get tight, which is great, though I imagine it could leave some players being frustrated if they get blocked out too often. There are correcting options though and every game has always felt like everyone's competing (even allowing for the hidden yet trackable resources and VPs)

Collect resources by sending out your villagers from the initial placement of your houses, but only one villager per field, thus others will block you depending on the order the houses send out their villagers. This makes the initial setup so important. The with the resources, you buy seats in the Cathedral, but you may have to upgrade your resources, so you have to think ahead a little (with a little bit of guessing also). Very nice game, not the nicest looking, but still great.

The "rush to the ending" breaks this a bit for me; the player who happens to have traded up for the right combinations of valuable cubes in the second-to-last round gets the point bonus that pushes them over the line. My impression of all of the Key games so far is that you spend an hour making decisions and then a winner emerges semi-randomly.

The game is somewhat low on control for my tase, but overall not a bad game. The initial placement of tiles to create the playing "board" is crucial in how well you do in the game. However, this important phase is fairlly chaotic and your eventual position is mostly out of your hands.

The long term strategy is simple: keep collecting as many cubes as possible. To accomplish this, you may need to bulid one or two tactical walls. Also, you should buy one of the two event cards as often as possible. The timing of tile purchases (and which tile) is very important and adds tension to the game, especially in the last few rounds.

RATING: 10
[4p] 9 great plays.  This game inevitably causes players to curse at each others decisions at nearly every play.

Combines the building aspect of Settlers, the resource aspect of Age of Steam, with the nasty card action of Jambo.  2 player variant is very tense and good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Cute mechanics, the way workers are assigned and the way you can block workers by building walls. The game has some problems though. Too much is determined in the initial setup, and too much of what happens after that is governed by a non-alterable turn order. The different resources are pretty same-ey, and not knowing which construction tiles are in the row of the "key"-thedral following the current row makes it hard to plan ahead. The deck of action cards are also very different card-to-card in terms of usefulness.

A neat little resource management game in the vain of Bazaar and Fresco. The way the resources are distributed (through player choice instead of die roll as in Catan) makes it much more balanced than many other games. On the other hand, the asymmetrical nature of the game can result in serious disadvantages if you screw up in the beginning. Also, I found that turn order becomes more important towards the later stage of the game, so going first in the last turn is a huge advantage and there should be a downside to it, or a catch-up mechanism of some kind. The artwork is horrible though. All in all, a solid Euro that is better than Catan (albeit similar) but nothing out of the ordinary.

RATING: 6
Pros:
* Far better than Settlers of Catan. More specifically, less frusturating since you'll always get some resources after every round.
* More diversity (in terms of resource combinations) in the accumulation of victory points. However, there's a bit of a gamble when trying to acquire some of the rarer resources, since they might not be required to gain victory points later in the game. This gamble might irritate some players, though.
* Good screw-your-neighbor factor.


Cons:
* There are two distinct parts of the game:
[1] The laying out of the city, in which you choose to place your settlements, which rarely move throughout the game. This part is largely stategic. Unfortunately, the second, much longer part is largely tactical.

[2] The collecting of resources, which is largely tactical, and unfortunately, a bit too static and repetitive for my tastes. The board doesn't change much, and the tactic of building fences isn't as important as upgrading settlements. In addition, the number of resources collected each round doesn't increase much throughout the game, just changes. This is why I prefer playing the short game. 

* The law cards suck! Many of them are powerful *only* in certain times during the game. I prefer playing this game *wihtout* the law cards. It's already quite a gamble to go for the rarer resources.

* Thematically somewhat weak; I call the resources by their color, not by what they represent.

Conclusion:
The "full" game is too repetitive and light. The short game is much better considering how repetitive this game can become. I would've prefered more variety  in things you could buy *other than* victory points. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Placement is everything: screw that up and you're basically screwed the whole game, as I discovered in a 5-player game.  Still, despite my crushing defeat, I'll enjoy playing it again and avoiding the mistakes I made in the first game.  It has an interesting twist to the turn order determination, and is loaded with strategy and complex decisions during the game.  I think the Law cards suck, though, and the game would be better without them.

This simple resource collection game quickly turns into a nasty game of denial. 90% of the game is basically decided after setup, and the other 10% relies on bidding for turn order. After all of that, you basically go through the motions of taking whatever resource blocks your opponents from getting as many goods as you that turn. If you don't mind that kind of back and forth treachery, you'll probably have a decent time. I'm not calling it a bad game, but it wasn't exactly to my tastes.

Richard Breese is my second Favorite Euro board game designer right behind Uwe Rosenberg.  Simple rules but tough decisions make Keythedral in my opinion a good gateway game to get people into either Euro games or Board games in general. This is a classic in my opinion and will always be in my collection.  The game flows and with the right group is a blast to play.  I know some complain about AP and can bog the game down but that annoyance can be said with any game with tough decisions.  If you like tough decisions with tension and some direct interaction with a little auction/bidding to either be first player or continue to be first player with heavy blocking by fencing other players off from getting resources thenthis is the game for you.

--Oct2004-- Pretty cool on one play.  It looks like a good solid middle-of-the-pack 7 to me - but more plays will bear it out.  A little too much opportunity (& requirement) to be nasty to your neighbour to be truly child friendly.  But equally, it's very hard to find yourself without any possible action. It'll be interesting to see what my now 4 year old thinks of it in a couple years: she'll probably be ready for it at 6.
--May2005-- Nice stuff.  Works surprisingly well with 2, too.

Wow.  I really enjoyed this one.   The theme worked for me, and it actually felt like a very, very, light version of Caylus.  I really liked the dynamic of sending your workers into the fields, and I really appreciate the bidding for turn order mechanic.  The art in this game is plentiful, but I have to admit that particularly the stone, timber, and food fields could have been concieved better.

my only neutral thought on this game it that the Keythedral building went too quickly once we reached the 10's and 12's.  I say this because I was able to win by taking 2 of the last 12's.   After looking at the expansion, I think it would be a welcome addition to the game...  in hopes that it slows the builds at this critical point.

A game I feel pretty useless. Much of the winning is earned during the preparation of the game. A feeling reminiscent of Catan... However, the "main" phase is just not fun.

The experience starts with very clear rules that make everything going on easy to follow. The game flows smoothly with interesting choices to be made - the level of luck kept at just enough to add some randomness and unpredictability. It really is just a pleasure to get into this and lose yourself for 90 minutes. Downtime is low. Brain strain is just about right. The bits are fantastic! I think the detail in the artwork is exceptional. (Unfortunately the colours will be hard for some people to distinguish between.) My find for the year. I like the scoring changes made in the latest edition. (Need to test it, but the game might be better with the cards face up for all to choose.) Did I mention that the game is a piece of art all in itself!?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yet another Euro in which colored cubes, called by the rules resources, are gotten and exchanged for victory points.  There is some naughty interaction and the possibilities of the players seem very similar, which leads to very close and tense games. Nevertheless, this virtue may become into its major sin, since the luck of the draw of the law cards may influence the final result and kigmaker situations may appear.  Nevertheless, the game's lenght and weight allow this to happen without spoiling the ludic experience and letting everyone enjoy.

Kind of a tough game to play strategically.  For the initial setup, your opponents can mess with you without even trying.  It seems like for the game I played, decisions were not really made based on long-term strategy, but just short-term payoff, which was frustrating for me.  Also, the first-player auction seems a little unrefined--the starting player didn't move much.

I've played a few times now - either I'm terrible at the opening placement, or there's something I don't like about the game. Maybe both. Probably the one contributes to the other... i.e. I don't like that I'm terrible at the opening. The opening has a lot to do with how well you do, as do the cards you get - I always feel like my opponents cards are way more powerful than mine.

Edit 2/25/06: I feel like I'm much better at the game now, but I don't like it much. The law cards are a TERRIBLE deal... about 30% of them are worth it (and they range from "amazing" to "just ok"). The rest suck ass. Some of them are so situational that they might as well just suck ass. And it bothers me a lot that if I buy Law cards and you buy law cards, you might win the game based on the disparity between the usefulness of your cards and the usefulness of mine.

I really wanted this game a lot when I first heard about it, so I was really excited by the reprint.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed when I was finally able to play.  While I can see some of the comparisons people make to Settlers, it is sufficiently different to me to warrant having.  I especially like the allocation of resources in this game and the tension among players that it provides.  However, it does take a few games to get a feel for how one should build their initial cottages, as this is extremely important to the game.

Enjoyed trying this, but it's quite difficult to pick up the first time.  I'm assuming it'll improve next time, as the initial setup seems to have a huge amount of influence on the game.  Despite that, it's reasonably equal, though we didn't figure out how to use fences, or make much use of the law  cards (they seem quite random).
Definitely worth trying again.
Still taking a while to understand, but seemed a bit easier the second time.

Igazi konfrontatív játék, egy kis Catannal, illetve Frescoötlettel keverve. Persze tudom, a Fresco a későbbi játék. Nem igazán kedvelem az ilyen konfrontatív játékokat, de azt kell mondanom, ez jól kidolgozott és érdekes játék. A nyolcszögletű lapok alapanyagokat termelnek, amiket értékesebb anyagokra lehet cserélni és ezekből fejleszteni, illetve a győzelmi pontokat hozó katedrális egyes darabjait felépíteni. Konfrontáció van, az anyagokbegyűjtésénél, konfrontáció van az egyes lehetőségek hamarabbi elvételével, illetve konfrontáció van a kártyák kijátszásával is. Aki az ilyet szerei nem fog csalódni a játékban. Egyetlen negatívumaként az róható fel, hogy úgy érzem elég sok múlik a házak és termelőterületek letételén, amit a játék során már semmilyen módon nem lehet megváltoztatni.

This is a great occupation/resource management game that comes heavy on feeling.  The art is great, with all the workers and houses drawn individually.  Very stunning.  

The game itself initially feels like it should be a Settlers game in concept, but plays out quite differently.  Tons of direct conflict and screwage.  The fact that the set up of the game doesn't really change makes you feel as if yielding resources with result in the same couple moves over and over agan, but every round plays quite different due to turn order and differing objectives.  I had a problem initially with the auction mechanic in a four player game to bid to see who goes first, it felt like the bidding turn should go counter (anti) clockwise rather than clockwise, but in a three player game this really doesn't become such an issue.  I've seen the merit in it over time.  This scales well from 3-5.  

If you want more control in the game, I recommend playing with the retardedly powerful and unpredictable law cards face up to buy.  Suddenly, you don't feel quite so screwed, as you could have acquired the cards yourself. So the consequences are your own fault -- you choose whether or not to get them.

The theme and ever variable MAP got me on this one!

I do like this somewhat better than Pillars, I think, because it has more interactivity between the players, but because of the more open competition for resources it is also a lot more cut-throat, which can cause a few hurt feelings at times.

Rating based on two plays. I bought this sight-unseen when when the local hobby shop went out of business. It's fairly standard for a Euro: collect different combinations of resources to purchase victory points. I felt that I was getting screwed all the way through this game, but in hindsight I realize that most of the other players were getting just as screwed. When you have 25 to 50 workers competing for 29 resource tiles, screwage is inevitable. The player order - and the ability to influence it - is vitally important.

Neat little euro with some clever mechanics that I'm sure were borrowed from some and copied by others.

RATING: 7.75
An elegant and interesting game, involving tile-laying strategy in the early stage, and area control and resource management subsequently.  [Some similarity to elements of Settlers of Catan and Stone Age.]  The theme (of gathering resources to contribute to the building of a Cathedral) works well.  The game mechanics may feel slightly odd to start with, but they soon become second-nature and fast-moving.  However, quite complex strategy decisions underlie the mechanics - deceptively so.  The early rounds can feel a little slow, but the pace and intensity increases dramatically in the final rounds.  Playable by two players, but not as enjoyable as with 3 or 4 in our view, as the building tiles take relatively longer to acquire, and the single Law Card restricts their variety.  A good game, that is interesting and challenging, without being excessively intense or brain-burning.  I enjoy it more each time I play it (and make fewer blatant errors).

I really wanted to like Keythedral, and the man who recommended it and taught it is someone who's taste in games usually gels with my own.  Bottom line, however, was that I found Keythedral to be mostly boring and too dependant on initial placement.  Furthermore, all it seems to take is one round's shut down through a fence and you're more or less completely out of the game.  I just don't see how one can make a dazzling comeback in this game -- which is a pity, because without some suspense it just ends up feeling stale.  The law cards also feel as though they do nothing, or way, way too much.  Ah well -- just not my game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My favorite of the two Breese "Key" games I've played.  This game starts out by all players placing a tile at random and then selecting an intersection of these tiles to place one of their five cottages.  The tiles each produce a different resource.  Then players activate these cottages in turn order and send workers out into the fields (tiles) to collect resources to spend later in the round.

There are a few things I love about this game.  While there is a decent amount of deep gameplay to mine out of this game it is reasonably simple to teach and play.  Also, there is a lot of interaction in this game which I love.  With the layout of the modular game board the intersections where two people have placed cottages can share multiple work tiles with other players, especially once you upgrade these cottages to houses and are able to send out two workers.  By just the second or third turn in a 3-player game each player was getting cut off from their fields, sometimes entirely.  I can just imagine how much more rampant it would be with more players.

You can also build fences to block other players from entering certain fields and there are Law cards that mix up the rules of the game for a fresh feel and some variability between games.

If this title didn't already fill a pretty crowded game space in my collection (worker placement/resource collection) and were more readily available I would be a lot more interested but I've still got my eye on it.

The last time I've played the game was 8 years ago! It sure survived time and age which proves that the game is good. Some executions might have been different from what is stated in the rules (like place workers then collect resources then remove workers) but that's just a minor detail. 

I enjoy the production mechanism and I think I like the easy goal of the game although the way to get it is more complex than what the rules apparently suggest. 

The thing I dislike the most is the negative interaction that can be provided by the law cards. I don't mind having some negative effects on other players. What I don't like is the lack of positive effect on the active player. Also some cards are way better than others which means that the game may improve if the Laws are displayed face up instead of hidden. 

Solid design and I intend to play it again and again and again, maybe 10 years from now!

The first thing that jumps out at me is that the artwork in this game is stunning.  Of the dozens of character tokens, terrain octagons (that's right, no hexes here!), cards, player screens, etc., there is almost no duplication of graphics.  Not only is "Keythedral" an absolute delight to look at, but it is also very fun to play.  Some have made comparisons to "The Settlers of Catan", but I find this game a LOT more fun to play than Settlers, with a significantly lower luck factor.  The way the game is designed allows it to scale well with varying numbers of players, and while adding more players certainly adds to the chaos, it also increases the interaction and fun of the game.  The expansion adds a few fun new twists to the 12-point tiles.  Game design: 5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 8/10

RATING: 6
Key-series game where players collect cubes to trade in for bricks in the cathedral. The core of the game is a playing field of octagonal fields separated by square cottages/houses, which players assemble in the game's rather long setup phase. Cottages are numbered 1-5 in each of the player colours, and cottages of a specific number disperse a worker onto one of the surrounding fields, in turn order, when that number is chosen. But numbers can be chosen in a different order each round (these are likewise picked in turn order), so some workers might find no vacant fields, workers from different cottages having already occupied them. Of course there is more to it, including upgrades (two workers instead of one from a cottage) and fences (block workers).

Resources collected from the fields are either spent on upgrades, traded for more expensive craft goods, or put towards the cathedral for end-game victory points.

I quite like the core mechanism of Keythedral, probably because I'm still not sure what good play looks like.  It's quite clear that poor placement in the initial setup is a fast train to losing the game, but not so clear what constitutes [i]good[/i] placement. It's very nasty.

Players can also purchase one-off, game-breaking law cards, which I very strongly dislike. Their lure encourages early passing in a round and the uncertainty adds an ominous frisson to the auction, but they are wildly uneven and so diverse that they cannot be reasonably planned for.

Juliet Breese's watercolours are lovely as always.

Still, very good game mechanics overall...ones that may have been seriously upgraded in Caylus.

Played 2+ times. What an interesting game.  There are slightly more than 5n (n = # players) resource cubes available for production each turn.  Everyone starts with a production possibility of 5 and can increase their own production possibility up to 10.  Demand is almost higher than supply right out of the gate and basically this results in lots of resource screwage. UPDATE: I'm not sure that there's as much control over the resource selection as I'd like.  I usually play for quantity rather than any particular resource.  This needs a couple more playings to see if I can swing things in my favor. 2006/01/23

A nice, quick little worker placement game (in so far as you have workers and place them), but that is a poor description.

The strategy is in the placing of numbered cottages and the timing and placing of your workers around each number. You can block others workers by placing fences or place your workers first 

It seems very reminiscent of Settlers, with the hexes and the resource collection, but is an entirely different game (and much better for it). I'm not a fan of the artwork at all, but this is a good game and well worth playing if the opportunity comes up.

Finally got to play this game.  Loved it.  Tastefully evil in the way it is implemented.  I very much enjoy that it is fairly easy to learn, and understand, but knowing the law cards, and the cubes coming out make for an interesting game all the way to the end. 

Multiple plays might make this feel samey though, Not sure yet, like to get more plays to find out.

Update: After a few more plays, I'm not sure there is much difference in the cubes at all.  They all convert to victory points at the exact same rate, so it's just a matter of collecting the ones you want to do the things you need, which means there's a lot of back and forth trying to guess what the other guy is going to do.

All in all, I'm dropping it down a bit, it makes a good first impression, but then falls off quite fast.

The law cards are very powerful, as noted by the fact you forgo the rest of your turn when taking one.  Still a really good game, but not quite the one I thought it was when first playing it.

If you wanted to, you can calculate out everything in this game in terms of victory points. Even down to the little stuff like, "If I destroy this fence for 2 red cubes, then I get two additional cubes because of it in future rounds, I've just broken even. If I destroy that fence and don't recover the cost, I'm losing victory points at the end of the game."

Right now, I'm just enjoying the game, so I don't play that way.

Your typical worker placement / gathering resources to buy victory points deal. This game favors experience a bit in that the setup of the board at the start of the game can dictate your ability to be competitive the rest of the game.

I played this 2002 game for the first time in August 2013. Despite the game's age, it played well. The laser focus on building sections of the Keythedral (the only way to score VP in the game) was a refreshing change of pace from today's "point salad" offerings. The law cards seemed a bit tacked on, but not entirely out of place. Likewise, the fences seemed interesting, but not game-changing. Overall, I enjoyed Keythedral, but it's didn't wow me either. Pleasant. I do feel that my group needed to take better advantage of the auction for turn order. That may provide additional tension that the game was lacking. Perhaps repeat plays would improve my opinion, but other, newer games always seem to fill the gap.

This is a game that needs to be played a couple of times before it's played well, I think.  For one thing, the opening positions are pretty important.  Also, knowing which resources are needed at a given time is a big advantage.  The action cards vary a bit in power, which can be a bummer if you get the ones that don't help very much.

Interesting mechanics, but there is something that makes this game not so fun. But still I like it very much.

RATING: 7
On the one hand, this is one of the (proto-) typical Euros involving worker placement, resource gathering, and building things.  On the other hand, it is much more brutal and cutthroat than a typical Eurogame.  So even though it is about worker placement and building  I'd compare it much more to Elasund or Dos Rios than Pillars of the Earth or Agricola.

There isn't much of an engine to build (other than upgrading a few cottages to houses), so it tends to emphasize tactics over long-term strategy.

I can see why this game isn't for everyone, but I rather like it although I'm reserving my rating until I've played at least one more time.  

As a final note, I really appreciate the small touches in production quality like the individual artwork on all of the worker counters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Settlers of Catan and Caylus were put into a blender.  Keythedral spawned out.  There are some strategic overtones in the initial placement of cottages, but after that it is clearly a tactics game.  Its a fun ride, and the law cards are quite an inventive catch-up mechanic.  It will probably never be my suggestion to play this, but it is an enjoyable way to pass time.   Your initial set up in this game is crucial to winning.  Your biggest decisions are in the beginning and the rest of the game proves who had the best set up.

Thinking the game is a bit lighter than it appears at first blush.  Not necessarily in a bad way, its just seems to be a bit of sheep in wolf's clothing.

This is a really cool and frustrating game then again, isn't that what you expect from a "key series" game? It's no a 10 in the least and isn't going to ever become one I don't suspect but its' still got some very cool things going on and I like the game a good bit and will look forward to playing it again.

I really like this. One flaw for some purposes -- the impact of that initial layout on the game's progression is huge, and might lead to lopsided wins or losses. Not sure I recommend it for play with non-gamers. Still, there are things to do to fight back against suboptimal positioning.

Update -- Downgraded after failing to get to the table in a long time.

Rating based on one play. Clever game, although the colours used are AWFUL a white coloured quarry tile produces a black cube which looks purple/brown in iconic form on the cards which indicate where it is to be spent. The brown and purple cubes are hard to tell apart too. 

The colour scheme was so bad we played it wrong thinking the early seats on the Keythedral needed purple blocks not black!

Very enjoyable indeed. The set-up is absolutely critical and a lapse here can hamper a player for the rest of the game, perhaps particularly in the two-player game. I especially like the way the "resources" can be used for trading and/or different types of action. The artwork is fabulous too.

I really like this game. I dig a ton of things about it, from the artwork to the gameplay. Flaw only in the frustration level which I can't figure out f it is part of the game or I haven't fully grasped the set up phase. (it seems all game I am wondering why things are working the way I wanted them to.)

But even though in my head it all seems like a possible 10 rating for me, my heart isn't in it. I can't find much reason to bring it to the table instead of others. I don't know why yet but only because I haven't played it in so long because I am never in the mood!

We finally tried Gene and Amy's copy, and it was alot of fun.  I really liked the progression of resource requirements.  It gave the game a feeling of movement and offered additional decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played with the short rules (one fewer building opportunity per level)- on one hand, I think the game might scale better with the extra deliveries, in order to increase the scoring opportunities (and make the scoring a bit less granular).  On the other hand, so much of the game really seems tied up in the initial placement, and the rest of the game thus seems less important.  It needs another play for me to decide what I really think of it, but it'll have fierce competition for table time.

EDIT: Played the full game, which is indeed much better.  Again, I'm frustrated at just how deterministic the game seems to be after the initial placement.  But I am motivated to keep trying again until I start to "get it", which is a good sign.  Rating upped to 7.

Manage worker production of materials necessary to construct the famous "Keythedral" (aka misspelled cathedral) and earn valuable pew seats. Keythedral offers plenty of player interaction for a "resource management euro" - in addition to the turn order auction, strategic worker placement for resource collection can engender indirect or direct methods blocking other workers. The board configuration is variable making each game unique thus increasing replay value. Resource cube conversion into points is stereotypical for a eurogame but works well here. Art is gorgeous and components are mostly excellent - the main gripe is that the cottage markers are slightly too large to keep the tile-board tightly in place but not quite large enough to sit atop their intersection spots.

Played once with 4 players, building tiles face up, law cards face down. Terribly disappointed, did not like the game at all. Until very late in the game I didn't really care what resources I was getting so much as how many, which deflated much of the tension from worker placement. The law cards were either virtually useless or too powerful (not only too good for oneself but also too hurtful to another unsuspecting victim). The imbalance of the law cards seems to be exacerbated by the fact that the stakes are so high at the end with the purchase of the "12" tiles. I would try playing with the law cards face up, but I don't really see enough that is otherwise redeeming about the game to justify the effort. Traded it away.

Richard Breese; A Keythedral is being built in the fields near Keytown, in the middle of the Keydom. The inhabitants of Keyland will gather the resources with which to build the Keythedral from the surrounding fields. The Keythedral will be built in five stages and each stage will require different building materials. In the early stages simple materials will be needed, as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed. Throughout the development period the builders will require food and water and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine.

This is another strategy game that requires some long-term planning, that can be marred by action cards against which you can't protect.  Plus, it's critical to place correctly during the setup of the board, or you can find yourself hosed until the game gets further underway.  It's still an OK game, but it doesn't have that sort of OOMPH to make it a great game for me.

Heavy on theme and just the right mix between good gameplay and interaction. Great game to play with new players. It becomes far more a strategic game with a 'open' (all the tiles face-up) cathedral. A 'closed' (tiles face-down) cathedral makes a great combination with the law cards. I can imagine strategic players be turned of by some lawcards and playing the 'open' cathedral.

The more complicated Settlers.  Gather resources to convert to VPs...there's probably a bit of an edge to those who have played before and can anticipate what kinds of resource sets will be needed in the future,  and what kinds of law cards there are (there are lots - this feels a bit tacked on "just to break rules").  Art is only okay for me,  even then it looks like a quality game.  Not a big fan of hidden resources.
Initial setup will dictate the entire rest of the game,  making "learn as you go" a bit rough.  Luckily doesn't last too long.  Probably more screwage than I'd like (can be especially rough early on).

This was an early contributor to the resource cube/VP frenzy that has since become an ugly mainstay of modern gaming.

Without fail, when playing, I complain that the board set-up takes entirely too long. As part of the ritual, friends remind me that the map construction is an important part of the actual gameplay.  That's fine, but excuse me while I return my fingers to my ears and roll my eyes again.

RATING: 1
Fundamental principle: Quantity > Quality. It's relatively unimportant for each cottage to be fully or even mostly surrounded because trades don't require specific resources. A cathedral tile from each row is a worthy goal, and if a player is unable to purchase, say, 6 and 4 but makes up for it with an extra 10, there's no difference because the ratio of cubes spent to VP's scored on such tiles is the same. Thus, it's preferable to abandon variety with two or three cottages in favor of a crap position with a 'backyard' (guaranteed) hex. If the option is available, shoot for black/brown because two first turn houses is rape. (4 resources per turn + 3 from backyard property - I would be genuinely surprised if other players managed to reguarly exceed this intake.) Avoid close proximity of like cities with the guy to your right, strive to shaft the guy to your left by doing so (e.g. my second through fifth placements follow your first through fourth), although the point is theoretically moot if people are providing themselves so many personal peninsulas the landscape is practically Norway. (Afterthought, and unavoidable one-up shaft in later placements: My '5' shafting your backyard '5', creating an even longer peninsula with me at the end, usurping your backyard property and simultaneously placing my own, necessitating you build a fence or gamble every turn for the resource... Does this game even work with people who know what they're doing?) Always get two houses within the first two turns, always upgrade the same number cottage as somebody else for the mutualism. Pretty much reduces the game to random timing of buying cathedral tiles.

Nonfunctioning Mechanics Dept: Resources hidden behind screens in a game with perfect information, rewarding brute memorization. Bid a cube to manipulate the turn order, maybe obtain one extra cube the next round. Buy a fence, maybe obtain a privilege only worth the resource you spent. Buy a law card, maybe obtain a benefit worth the resource spent, maybe less, maybe more.

This was a fine game, but Donnnnie has a copy and I din't think our group needed two of them.

(Trade Interest: medium) until i hear different, the new version of the game seems broken.  adding points scored for resource cubes makes it so that the game can get stuck with one or two high cost Keythedral seats that no one will want to pay for.  it's a minor issue to deal with, but it really bogs down the game.

I think comparisons to Settlers is not fair to Keythedral -- Keythedral is a much better game! Yes, it's harsh, confrontational and far more unforgiving than you might expect, but what a great game! Every decision is crucial. Every turn is important. And the game gets a full .5 bump from 7.5 to 8 by virtue of the AMAZING attention to detail in the art, with each token having wholly unique illustrations! A top notch, wonderfully strategic game.

Wow, what a disappointment. I heard some good reviews on this one, so I expected a nice game, but it turns out to be a very dry and mechanical game. Produce colored cubes, turn them into other colored cubes, buy VPs, lather rinse repeat. The turn order auction and the production mechanic felt weird and clunky, yet they are what drives the game as well. Very poor job on teh wording of the action cards. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what they mean, despite the fact that the actual effects of the card are sometimes really, really simple! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Unexpectedly cutthroat, the nastiness of the worker placements is increasingly ramped up after the first round, and unsuspecting players would be totally screwed in terms of gathering the right resources.  Not sure if I like the fact that the initial village positioning having such a big factor in how one performs for the rest of the game, since it is the driving force in how efficiently you can collect the right combination of commodities.

Also not convinced on the importance of the turn bidding, it seemed as if the cubes are better utilized to collect the points from building the cathedral.  Kind of iffy on the law cards, some seem to grant an extraordinary amount of advantage at such a small cost.

Even so, I enjoyed the interaction as well as the design.  Would definitely play again when given the opportunity.

I bought this as I wanted a light-weight tactical wargame I could play even with non-wargamers. The rules are very easily learned and taught. A game I would consider a direct competitor to Conflict of Heroes. As with CoH, it feels a bit TOO simple and straight-forward. When I played it I missed the more varied options I have in for instance Combat Commander or ASL.

Very impressed with this game.  I'm normally more interested in strategic or operational level games but wanted something more tactical as I start teaching my kids to play.  Looked at Combat Commander, Lock 'N Load, Conflict of Heroes, and ASL among others.  All appeared to be good games but each had something that didn't quite fit what I was looking for.  

Then I stumbled onto Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles.  I wasn't crazy about the artwork at first but that wasn't my top criteria, and regardless, it's actually grown on me to the point that I like it.  What I wanted most was an excellent historical/simulation game with realistic tactics, reasonable playability for new wargamers, enough depth to keep the interest of experienced players, and expandability into multiple theaters.  What I found appears to be a perfect fit.  

The 101st Airborne in Screaming Eagles is a great choice in terms of the conflicts they were involved in.  The 11th Panzer in Ghost Panzer and 1st Marine in The Old Breed appear to be equally good choices for covering a wide range of conflicts.  Looking forward to more games in the series and would love to see low cost expansions added with scenarios for other divisions such as the 63rd Infantry and the 11th Airborne (both divisions my dad served in :)) offered in the future.  I think offering what I'll call "division packs" as expansions would send the popularity of this system through the roof as a lot of people I know have "attachments" to various divisions.

To the designer, Jim Krohn, and Worthington Games: excellent job, keep up the good work!

This was not a game as much as a revelation.

I have been looking for the perfect WWII/small unit/tactical game my whole life.  I have tried out many.  Some suffer from too many rules.  I want a game, not a way of life.  Some suffer from absurdity, such as not being able to order a unit because you don't have a card, be it a sectional card or a "fire" card.  Some suffer because of a lack of vehicles.  Some suffer from "gameyness", such as bum-rushing a unit that has fired or used OP Fire, because you know the unit cannot fire.  Some suffer because they aren't on VASSAL.  Some suffer more than one of these reasons.

What this game does is takes a small rulebook and clearly presents a system that gives a realistic feel to small unit WWII combat.  It utilizes two levels of suppression and casualties.  The values are printed right on the counters (along with range), so in order to initiate combat, you use these values and use the player aid's other modifiers (generally terrain-based), and you have your value, which not only tells you if you hit, but also how much damage you committed in terms of casualties and suppression.  After a game or two, you no longer need the player aid, because you have memorized those values, as well.

It uses no cards, and no random events. The game play is logical.  You don't do moves because of rules, but rather because it is what you would do in that situation, in other words, no skulking.  And did I mention the rulebook?  Seven pages cover infantry-based combat (with mortars and machine gun crews).  Four more pages give you artillery, bazookas, tanks, and vehicles (yes, vehicles!)

The biggest complaints I hear about are component quality, over-simplicity of melee combat, and too many die rolls.  In regards to quality, the counters look good.  The maps have something to be desired in terms of trying to look too pretty vs. functionality, which is a shame, because it adds a small level of confusion that should not be there (involving LOS).  Melee is a bit too simple, but I prefer it over 8 more pages of rules covering this -- especially since fire and barrage combat are covered so well with so little overhead.  As far as die rolls, this is a legitimate complaint as well, because  if you want to have a unit move and fire on an enemy unit, you could roll the die three times to perform that move and 6 times if the enemy succeeds in OP Fire.  But seriously, how long does it take to roll a die, when the numbers are right on the counter without a need to consult a chart?  You aren't getting carpal tunnel syndrome!

In addition to the best realism vs. amount of rules payoff in the business, this game also tells a narrative.  It's not the kind of John Henry/Paul Bunyun barroom stories that you can get from a certain game series, which is fine by me, because I also don't have to tell the story of my machine gun nest not being able to fire because I couldn't draw a "fire" card even though the spot they manned was worth a bunch of VPs.  Instead, the GAME tells a narrative: the scenarios follow the missions of the 101st Airborne division from Normandy through Market Garden.

I guess in that sense, another complaint I see is "another airborne game?"  Sure -- another airborne game -- because it's about time someone did it right and gave the airborne a game worthy of them and this is it!

One of the most amazing games that I have ever seen.  I lost interest in the other games that cover the same scope because this one does in better and does it with less verbiage and waste.  I love many games, but only a few (less than 5) are what I would call "game changers" and this is one of them, because it changed how I looked at games.

A system that leans heavily upon squad leader can never go too wrong.

It is indeed simpler and has taken away most skin and muscle, leaving bare bone to be played with. The removal of support weapons and leaders, made this into a pure fight where every squad performs perfectly with all equally capable leaders. The moral check chart was removed and simplified into a few numbers that controls infantry activity and kill numbers worked into a D10 system.

Weapons team lives and dies with their weapons. And because they are a separate unit, the WS team could be used as buffers to extend a line. This effect is both mixed to me. I have a fire team and a mobile team in that sense. 

Played only the infantry battles.
Will test the guns and tanks again soon. Need for gaming before I comment.

Smart rules that allow for a lot of realism in just 20 pages. Suppressing tactics are the forte of this game, but there are a few other mechanical gems that make this game special.
On the other hand, I really dislike the look of the counters, the maps are small and the scenarios are so-so. Conjugated to the general lack of chrome, games often feel like pushing numbers rather than telling a story.
A very good lesson in WWII tactics, with all the dryness of an actual lesson.

This game has broken me. Band of Brothers is the squad level war game I have been looking for the last decade. Everything about it is the apex of fun, tactics, and elegance. It achieves this while having the most accessible rules set I have seen on a war game (excluding C&C). The worst part of the game is the feeling of sadness it gives me for all the money I have invested in other squad level systems.

Flow of the game DOES feel right: suppress opponent squad with firepower, then rush it with another unit, but it's not as simple to play as advertised. Fewer rules than other hex-based wargames, but there is still plenty of housekeeping, perhaps unavoidable in the genre. I'm still looking for the middle ground between traditional "hard" hex-based games and the very "soft" Memoir '44.

As a computer game, this might be a 10.

RATING: 9
It's great for what's it is intending to be: a simulative experience that doesn't get bogged down in too many rules. It's a breath of fresh air. If played correctly, the outcomes of the dice rolls blend into the background and you are left with the engaging interactive puzzle of how to move your squad optimally to achieve the current sub-objective (suppress or reduce a hostile unit) or the overall objective. 

The simulative experience can, at times, cause a scenario to lack dramatic pop. But there are many moments as you learn (and continue to play the game) that bring a different sort of satisfaction. For example, the first time you have a hostile unit rout and reduce due to your unit's adjacency, you'll feel the tactical decision space open up before your eyes (and that's just the infantry).  The system, for what it is able to provide in light of its fairly light rule set, is simply superb. 

There are some other flaws. The player aid and rule book could both be improved. I'd want the round structure on the player aid, at the least. The rule book isn't particularly good as a reference tool. Further, the way in which some of the passages are written make it a bit more difficult to learn the game that it should be. The rule book's issues seem more organizational than anything else. After a few plays, however, my minor issues with the rulebook and player aid end up being not much of an issue.

As of now, the system is best as a 2 player experience. As a solo experience, the dice rolling takes, as a percentage of overall game play, a bit more than I'd like. If a solo module gets developed for this, I'd like the AI's dice rolls to be on the cards (e.g., draw one card for the AI command and draw a second for the dice roll).

First game in the Band of Brothers series, which is my favorite WWII Squad level game.

This is the very definition of elegant, a quite simple system, that nevertheless rewards real world (as opposed to "gamey") tactics.  You cannot bunch up, no killer stacks, but Find, Fix, Flank and Finish works really well.

The ratings of Firepower, Proficiency, three states of current morale and the Casualty rating all combine to allow the game to show differences between troops with ease and accuracy.  As you will see in Ghost Panzer, those attributes well describe the units, and you will find yourself using your US Paratroopers differently than the Russian sub-machine gun squads.

And then, vehicles are added in with minimal rules overhead and they also end up behaving historically.  As much as I love this game, the real design accomplishment is that the same system is working well with other nationalities, different theaters, etc. 

Not to be missed

This game is a masterpiece.  In my view it's both accurate and highly playable; a brilliant example of 'design for effect'.  It contains a simple ruleset which, from what I can see, accurately simulates WWII squad-level action, thereby enabling the players to focus on tactics and strategy without getting drowned in chrome or drawn into unhistorical tactics.

I recently read the story of the action at Lanzerath on the first day of the Ardennes Offensive, in which a single 24-man platoon held off a battalion of German volks- and panzer-grenadiers, inflicting hundreds of casualties in the process.  The action illustrated several things:  (a) the suicidal nature of frontal assaults in WWII, (b) the need for basic suppress-and-flank tactics in taking a position, and (c) the need for combined arms (one German tank, in support of the infantry, would have been sufficient to take the American position quickly and almost bloodlessly).   

This game could readily simulate that action (given that the attacker were to commit himself to a direct frontal assault).  It also would be very unlikely to reproduce it in a game, since the attacking player would never go for the tactics used by the commanders in the actual action.

RATING: 6.5
After 2 plays:

- My conclusions match some others, that there the game feels VERY mathy, and that there are a lot of die rolls. I'm not yet sold on the need for three different resolution rolls for three different types of action - morale, proficiency (ie modified morale) and firepower. For one thing, the proficiency check usually just acts as a "to-hit" roll, where other games abstract to hit and to kill as one roll, for good reason - to keep down on wristage.

- I find myself uncomfortable with the mathiness of proficiency, when it winds up representing something very simple:

American - prof 2 - 10/6/2 = prof checks on an 8/4/X
German - prof 4 - 10/5/1 - prof checks on a 6/1/X

In practise, this meant that the German squad couldn't really think about firing until the enemy were directly adjacent, and once suppressed, could be counted on not to fire. The Americans could fire much more reliably. Well modelled, on paper. Probably realistic. In practise, it feels... lacking somehow? I get that the D10 maps to a % chance of action, but you just end up rolling a bunch of dice and at random one of your troops does something. It might be "realistic" (for a given value of realistic), but it's not necessarily fun, especially for the German player. Especially since when "suppressed", the Germans are basically irrelevant, while the Americans maintain a not inconsiderable combat effectiveness. It just means the game is very different from the American point of view because they just flat out have better troops.

I mean, proficiency is simply a modifier to morale, designed to make sure types of troops behave according to how well they were trained. It feels like the designer wanted to force certain decisions on the player, but for the sake of modelling "reality", pretended to give the player more choice. I mean, who is going to fire at long range with a suppressed German squad, even if you have the option?

- Command points as re-rolls feels clumsy, too. They should be a -2 modifier or similar - something that makes you more likely to do a key action at a key moment, like a good battlefield leader should. Aren't commanders in the line meant to bolster troops' combat effectiveness? I get that the Sergeants' ability to do that is factored into the counters' morale and proficiency, but this is one argument for having commissioned officer counters (though I can see arguments against as well). For me, having ephemeral "command" floating about feels too gamey. In a "realistic" game, what d they represent? Moreover, if a lieutenant is particularly good at motivating troops, then he should stay on one part of the front, not flit about like a ghost. If he is flitting about, you should be able to target him, or hit him as collateral.

- Criticism of what command points represent aside, I very much appreciate the turn structure and 'company-level' command. Operational ranges are clever and allow for some deep tactical decisions-making. Command points add less depth than operational ranges, but are interesting nonetheless, especially given the breadth of options they allow. 

- The idea of rolling when you want to do something to see if you can is great in theory, but in practise you just take a huge number of low-odd rolls just to see if you get anything (never a good thing in my view), and then from time to time get annoyed when you fail to do something vital, with good odds, at a key moment in the game. The luck does balance out with so many rolls, but with so few troops it didn't feel like I could make fire groups with any redundancy, and thus ameliorate bad luck.

- The game suffers from limited squad types, terrain types, limited scenarios. The Germans are not fun to play, because their proficiency is so high that they can't do much when you need them to. Their firepower is also so low that causing casualties on fire is rare. The scenarios all seem quite samey, though we haven't played any with victory hexes yet - just with exit and elimination conditions. The two we played, it felt like the "4F" tactics the rules had been written to make us use were the ONLY viable tactics... and when we used them, we were successful almost all of the time. Once there is more than one scenario designer, and the game's rules have had a bit more testing by players, I think the variety of scenarios will increase. Further releases with new maps will solve the terrain variety problem, and hopefully the squad variety problem too. The counter variety problem is a little annoying, as Combat Commander has far more variety for a similar rules overhead.

- The counters are too cramped, and present too much numerical info. Given my suspicion about proficiency as a mechanic, I feel like the proficiency number could be either positioned somewhere else or taken care of by unit classes and modifiers (ie elite units get a -1 to morale checks to fire, inexperienced units get a +1). Unit resilience/toughness (whatever its called) could just be a global figure - I don't know if it's worth representing morale abstractly in two different places on the counter. My gut feel is that firepower, range and W/Y/R morale are enough.

- I'm also not sure on this, as I'm no military historian, but weren't the 'four Fs' a distinctly late-war American tactical practise? I don't know what the equivalent for the Germans were, and I doubt they used the 'Four Fs'. I woudl go so far as to say that a game system designed around the assumption that the 'Four Fs' were the supreme tactical doctrine of the Second World War, and around AARs written by men indoctrinated in the 'Four F's' will inevitably look like the war through American eyes.

I would like to play some more, but as yet I'm not convinced it achieves anything new. The model is certainly fresh, but the results it produces feel very similar to other offerings - because it's based on the same source material.

Doesn't really fit here, but - seanmac often criticises ASL for making you fire at already-broken units, but it's rarely a good way to kill them off. In fact, ASL really encapsulates the 4f's well - you have to find (get rid of concealment), fix (pin or break), flank (run up alongside from many different directions) and finish (eliminate through flanking and failure to rout, or in melee). I just don't see that BoB does the 4Fs better than ASL.

AFTER MY 4th PLAY: I will admit that BoB is much better than I gave it credit for after the first scenario with tanks. What changed? Playing on four maps gave room for maneuver, which makes for a much more interesting game, with greater tactical depth.

I'm not sold on tanks. They feel like ASL tanks lite, which reduces the rules overhead a lot but makes them perhaps too deadly versus infantry in buildings. They also all behave as turretless, which is a bit silly (though I guess it's acceptable abstraction). To Kill rolls are almost identical to ASL tanks, without the need to calculate ranges, hit locations etc. They are appropriately brittle (when compared to other wargames I've played) once you have the means to take them out.

Large games make the Op fire rules seem poorly-constructed - because you can only fire a few times with any real chance to hit, the bum rush of ASL is pretty much viable. I still don't think there's all that much difference between red suppression and broken, especially once prof checks come into it. I'm also nto sold on Op Fire tokens, since all they seem to do is designate your units as targets and prevent you from using them later (though I'm going to check that rule right now as the FAQ makes me wonder if I'm wrong).

The game still feels like it's trying to tell me what to do with the proficiency system - like instead of just disallowing behaviours, the designer tries to make certain behaviours so much relatively worse that you'll always take the 'smart' option or no option at all. And in practise it translates to a lot of dice rolling.

I think I'd rather play this than CC:E, but I'd almost always rather play ASL. That being said, this one really captures the fluidity of combat thanks to its innovative tun system.

RATING: N/A
Faster and more realistic than all other Tac-Sims! Pretty easy to learn although there are a lot of modifiers to keep track of. 
My only criticism is that I would have preferred more scenarios where the attacker looses if he takes too many casualties even if he accomplishes his objective, but this is a minor complaint, and ALL the scenarios feel balanced, tense and are a joy to play as they are now.

After playing it a lot and re-falling in love with another tactical system I feel that BOB play often feels slightly repetitative, in that you make a plan at the start of the game (or at least at the start og each turn) and then execute it. There are less dramatic moments and sudden swings of initiative or turn of events, but I guess that is quite realistic. Its just not as plain nail-biting exciting as Conflict of Heroes, but much! more realistic in terms of tactics and how a battle plays out.

Preliminary rating based on solo play.  Excellent game with lots of interesting decisions but relatively few rules.  This may be the best squad-level tactics system in the long run.  For now, it's a bit lacking in variety in units (the American squads are all elite paratroopers), scenarios, and terrain. The East Front module, Ghost Panzer, should open things up quite a bit. 

---------------------------------------------

Still like the system, but downrated due to scenarios - most of them fill the entire width of the board with attackers, not offering much decision in how to approach them. Just shoot and hope for the best.  The defender often has little to do other than marking units for opportunity fire.  

Doesn't compare well to the very rich ASL starter kit scenarios.

My go-to game for a quick fix of tactical WWII infantry combat.

Relatively simple (OK, compared to ASL, anything is relatively simple), quick setup, fast play.

You get infantry fire-and-movement, weapons teams, portable AT weapons (bazookas, panzerfaust), armor, mortars, off-board artillery, in a rulebook a mere 16 pages long (and that includes the designer notes).

The rules are streamlined and cut out all the fluff.  

The operations range minimizes downtime since one person will move 3-4 units and then the other person will move a handful of theirs and each play has opportunity for op fire. Pacing is very quick!

The Suppression/Morale mechanics seem to realistically portray what WWII tactics were really like. There is no giant kill stacks that get their FP ridiculously high to blast an opponents kill stack out of the building down the street into oblivion. You have to lay down suppressing fire, close in, and finish them off in close. Find, Fix, and Flank.

The concealed/decoy markers help you to not have perfect knowledge of every unit on the battle field.  This makes every game you play different and allows different hidden strategies to be employed.

Easy to teach, easy to learn. Very few pages (though the rules could be a little more clear in places). The game presents a system for infantry, guns, weapons teams, and tanks in a very short amount of rulebook space.

This game gives you infantry, machine guns, mortars, off-board artillery, tanks and a dozen and a half scenarios that weave the narrative of the 101st airborne in Europe.

Some criticism: The scenarios feel a bit claustrophobic.  Not much room to maneuver or have multiple pathways to choose from since the opposing forces start right on top of each other within a narrow front.  Some of the scenarios just call for tactical retreats and waiting the clock out. -- 2nd edition has more scenarios incoming

Ghost Panzer takes the engine of this game, and appears to have addressed my misgivings with an otherwise great game and system. The new proficiency rules greatly enhance the pacing!

It is fun, fast, and cool.

Played via VASSAL.

Since 1977 WW2 boardgame tacticals have built on the flexibility of miniatures rules sets and Screaming Eagles is no exception. Kind of makes me want to stat up some troops and vehicles, pull out a HASL mapsheet, convert some scenario cards. Hey...

BOB:SE slaughters a lot of sacred cows. Responds to the abiding nostalgia for a tactical at the complexity of original Squad Leader. Half of the rule book is a well thought-out apologia which is kind of inspirational.

Really don't like the counters or counter art. If it turns out that I like game play enough, I may just do up a set with NATO symbols. Really, really wish, however, that the rules set had been applied to the study of a historical action.

Purchased without resarching first thinking i wanted a squad level wargame that can also be played solo. Took me 3 hours to get the basic infantry rules down. Played two scenarios solo and it was fantastic. It feels realistic yet simple and fast at the same time. Very good.

Looks to be the simplest squad-level WWII game yet. I am concerned that wristage may get out of control once units start becoming suppressed (each suppressed unit must take a morale check whenever it tries to do anything), but we'll see how it goes.

UPDATE: A couple of plays in, the die-rolling isn't too bad, although I haven't played any especially large scenarios. The upcoming sequel game apparently streamlines the rolls, so that may mitigate the one potential flaw.

FWIW, with zero prep I managed to teach this to and play it with a guy who'd never even seen a traditional wargame before, and we both had a good time with it. I am withholding a numeric rating until I explore the game further, but it's likely to rate at least an 8.

UPDATE: I'm giving it an 8. Could go up once I try the new rules. I *love* that they haven't changed further with subsequent releases. That's a good sign.

Players are the Germans or US, fighting squad level engagements based on the 101st Airborne Division in Europe, 1944 and 1945.

A new take on the crowded squad level World War 2 games, and a very good one.  Players set up a scenario, which indicates how many squads a player MUST activate on their impulse - the wider the range, the greater the tactical flexibility.  Squads move and/or fire, or can be marked as Opportunity Fire, waiting for a target to present itself.  Fire is a simple die roll against a unit's firepower rating, which can be modified by terrain and the target's posture (if they are moving in the open, they are in trouble).  Units that take fire get suppressed, which directly affects their morale, and their motivation to pop their head up and act.   Simple rout and melee rules round out the sequence of play. 

There is a lot to like about this.  Rules are tight, terse and very manageable.  The scenarios based on what I've played so far are excellent and well balanced. The most important thing is this game feels "right" - you are quickly spreading out, creating fire and movement teams to suppress the enemy, reduce pockets of resistance, and getting the mission completed.  No cards, no leaders, no heroes, just put your platoon leader hat on and work through the tactical problem.  This doesn't feel like a movie, this feels real.  Quite an accomplishment.

After trying many, many squad level systems over 20 years, we finally have a winner.  This is the one. 

Components are a mixed bag.  The large unit counters are delight on my eyes (which are beginning to struggle with tiny counters).  The maps can cause some confusion with their artistic style, especially the hedgerows, but nothing terribly drastic.  The markers that tend to swamp everything as a turn progresses are possibly a touch too large.

Playing with the v2 rules makes the Proficiency handling much more intuitive.  The modifiers now feel the right way around, directly affecting firepower, and the die rolling has been reduced.  For me, a perfect game.

2016-12-13 : I'm a bit torn about this game because on the plus side it rewards historical battlefield tactics and feels just right, but on the minus side a system where units first have to be "activated" and then perform an action is clunky and leads to dice rolling and arrhythmic overdose. I must confess that the constant adding and subtracting of drm's was getting to me after a couple of hours - and that's why I'm not a fan of tactical level games in general. A solid system, but not for me.

The claim to fame of the BoB system is that it was designed from the ground up. Rather than relying on mechanisms that have become tropes of tactical WWII gaming (such as separate leader counters), the system is based on the infantry tactic (at least the US tactic) of [i]find-fix-flank-finish[/i] which involves suppressing an enemy and making it safe to close in for CC. Not sure if the four Fs were a German doctrine as well but in any case, it feels right.

To that end, suppression is the fulcrum on which the game turns. Each unit has an activation number that must be rolled before it attempts to move or fire and it gets reduced as it suffers hits. Apparently, very few units were eliminated at distance as happens in many wargames, but instead they were suppressed by firepower until some sort of close combat could finish them off. 

The result is that you can't be quite sure if your unit will actually do what you want it to do because it may fail its morale check. All of this makes perfect sense and has received many deserved kudos for approaching the subject from a fresh – and more realistic – perspective. The questions that remains is “Is it fun?” Well, like all these tactical systems, it's a matter of taste.

I found the number of dice rolls and modifiers interrupted the flow of the game. You'd frequently go through 4 to 5 modifiers to get to the net of it and make a lot of rolls that resulted in nothing activating. It's one thing to get rid of a CRT but not at the cost of the mental gymnastics required here. I can get two shots in Conflict of Heroes in the time it takes to compute one here. Interestingly, the designer agreed and streamlined the system in Ghost Panzer. 

With your units reduced and needing a 5 or a 1 on a D10 to activate, your decisions to do stuff might be taken out of your hands. If you value the adherence to realism, you'll find fun in grinding down your opponent's options by forcing him to roll low on a D10.  Otherwise it may feel like more of a simulation and less of a game. Realistic, yes, but I didn't get a great sense of tension and excitement. Personally, I find more tension in CoH knowing my opponent can activate a spent unit with CAPs or possibly a card than the dice activation system here.

This sounds really negative and I don't mean to be. But I do want to provide a tempered point of view to anyone considering this system. Like all systems, it has its pros and cons and it's a matter of finding the aspects that provide the most fun for you. In any case, I'm happy for a a fresh taken on the genre, and I'd definitely be open to trying the system again with the Ghost Panzer rules.

Yet another tactical system which offers good fun in a small package.  The format and scale will appeal to players looking for quick games with few pieces.  The system is streamlined and easy to learn; I like the way the usual fixtures of squad level games are blended in this game.  Fire, movement, command, moral and LOS have been incorporated to offer a good feeling of battle chaos and control.  The opportunity fire rules are interesting and deadly.  There is a very good balance of realism and abstraction that will appeal to fans of the genre who are looking for a good quick game.

Best WW2 tactical squad level wargame out there IMHO.  Simple rules and feels right.  Not nearly as gamey as other unmentionables that have multiple phases.  Games that encourage large stacks to increase firepower or  firing on "broken" units to finish them off.  Needs a little more chrome and more modules which are in the works to make it a 10.  If they are as good as this I may have to sell off my ASL, ATS, Lock n Load collection (oops I mentioned them . . .)  Some have complained about number of die rolls but really no worse than than others in the genre.

I was looking for a squad level tactical game and did a lot of research on the titles available and choose Band of Brothers.  Jim Krohn's "Why Band of Brothers" article and my experience with his Space Empires 4x games convinced me.

The game feels more focused on small unit tactics then the hardware centricity that I experienced with other titles I used to own.  The second edition components are very nice and the rules are clear and organized fairly well.  The game is layered like the old Avalon Hill programmed instruction method used to add more unit types and complexity.  

I play almost exclusively solitaire and the way units check to move/fire maintains the fun and excitement.

Reading through the rules, this game seemed to "improve" on some non-thematic elements of Combat Commander, my favorite squad based game.
But in actuality, it felt awkward in play, the hidden mechanic was more fiddly than fun, and it simply didn't wow me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Impression so far: 

- lots of rolling/wristage

- I dislike the hedgerow rules. I am not saying they are broken, but they are clearly a source of consternation for many players.

- I like the intent of the suppress/assault game play.

- I like that firepower cannot be combined. The designer seems to take a dig at other squad based games for their ahistorical handling of this aspect of gameplay.  I see his point, but in most of the other squad based games you're not going to do too well if you try to concentrate forces anyway. 

- The player aid card is two sides of bulleted text and is IMHO cumbersome

- Lots of modifiers in fire combat.  This is the nature of the beast for tactical games, but it seems to slow things down in BoB more than others. Worse, the modified die result can dip in to the negative, which then has to be compared to an FP number to result in suppression.  Two other numbers then need to be added to the result and compared to FP to determine casualty reduction.  So lets say I have a lucky roll of a "1" on a unit moving in the open for a "-4" modifier.  The modified roll is a "-3".  Compared to the FP of the firing unit (let's say 4), that is obviously less.  No problem... the target is suppressed.  The target's first casualty number is 4 which, when added to the modified die roll is 1... still less than FP, so there is a casualty reduction and the unit is fully suppressed. The second casualty number is 8, which when added to the modified die roll is 5, which is not less than FP, so there the unit is not completely eliminated.  That's a lot of overhead to save from having to have a fire table or CRT.  Now try that when the target moves adjacent, being final op-fired upon through a hedgerow by a used unit.  Assuming proficiency check is made, the final op firing unit adds 2 to his roll (for final op-firing), subtracts 3 for adjacency, subtracts 4 for the target moving in open ground (no hedgerow bonus because the target moved in next to the hedgerow), and then adds the resulting modifier (-5) to the die roll of 4, resulting in a -1. Okay, unit is suppressed... now do the math for casualty reduction.  You have to do this a lot in the game.

Sorry, I'm just not feeling the love. I hear that Ghost Panzer, the sequel, solves a lot of these issues.  Just moving out of Normandy will solve the bocage problem. :)

My first step into the wargaming world. Still didn't have a chance to play this a whole lot other than solo. I don't usually enjoy solo games, but this is a game that I can stand playing this way. 

The system looks very promising, especially regarding infantry combat. I still didn't get to use vehicles, but the rules for guns already feel a little counter-intuitive. I cannot compare with other wargames, but some scenarios can be a little long for my attention span, at least playing solo. Will update this as it gets more plays.

-----------
Update 07/13/12: I just played Scenario 14 (with tanks) solo and wow... how much fun that was! I'm more and more impressed by how tight the victories are, most battles being decided on the last turn. It seems almost impossible for a SATW to destroy a Tank though, but it is certainly a lot of fun to create strategies around it. Tanks are absolutely devastating, but they strong penalties for firing after moving make for very interesting decisions during gameplay. Raising the rate 1 point.

-----------
Update 10/09/12: Downgraded rate to a 7. Playing as the defender is just not fun: you are basically marking units for OP fire and trying to stop the other side's advance. Maps are just too symmetrical: is map 3 really the representation of a small town??? Scenarios feel too samey for my tastes. It's a pity, because the system is great. I can get more varied and interesting narratives playing several games of [thing=2346][/thing] though, so why bother...

Very favorable first impression, eager to play more. The first scenario played out exactly as to match my reading on hedgerow combat. This could be a special game. One troubling concern is that the scenario design appears a little flat after the first three scenarios -- and a good system is only half the fight with these tactical games, you need good scenarios too. Will keep exploring.

RATING: 8
Rating based on reading trough the rules and playing some solo sessions. 
BOB has clever components, a good set of simple, short and a little innovative rules, 16 scenarios you can adapt at other game systems and a seamless adaptability with miniatures... In a word: a blast. But imo BOB is a sort of playkit: it's a system in his infancy, it will became an handsome guy through the players input and a market success. 
Otherwise it will remain an interesting little but quite quickly forgotten gem for two basic reasons. First of all, if the designer is succesful in presenting a game system with very few rules and high simulative/gaming potential at a very low price the gem is nonetheless published by a "second line" editor. this "low profile" philosophy conflicts with those of the majors (GMT, MMP and battlefront)with their obsession of expansions and editions and the opinions stated by the designer in his notes deepen the matter. In second instance, this days are ruled by the "fashion appeal". the visual appeal of BOB is less spectacular than you find in other, less interesting, tactical games like band of brothers or conflict of heroes. So, imo this interesting and elegant game system needs a lot of support from the community of wargames to grow and I think it deserves that support; but I also think that the very few of us are going to change our tastes, so deep is the asl syndrome in our gaming souls...

Boasts a great meshing of simulation with game. I highly appreciate the research invested and the originality in design. These taken alone would make a higher rating.

However the rulebook needs re-organization, corrections, and added examples of play. And bottom line: the required calculations for determining successful fire violate my threshold for fiddly-ness.

RATING: 7.5
There's a lot to like in this one: The supression and rout/melée subsystems, the proficiency checks, the absence of fire groups, the limited  effectiveness of MG fire when firing at targets in hard cover.

Unfortunately the scenarios are kind of bland and predictable with no unforeseen events and little room for other than the most obvious tactics. The fluffy geomorphic maps and the very small variety of units makes this flaw even more pronounced.

Last but not least the operations range and command points feel rather artificial and can be easily gamed by the players.

In any case, I'll keep an eye on future games in this series with the hope of finding more interesting scenarios.

RATING: 6
After the first three scenarios I'm still pretty underwhelmed. The underlying system has some promise, though I'm still not finding all the die rolls and modifiers particularly fluid, but the rest of the "package" isn't making me want schedule a dozen more plays of future scenarios.

I'll probably try one or two more scenarios, to get into the vehicle rules a bit, then more than likely try to sell/trade it. Maybe the next scenario or two will change my mind.

The biggest problem so far is the lack of variety in scenarios. Scenario 1, 2, and 3 all feature elite American forces attacking and crappy German forces defending. That's pretty much the counter mix you get. No good Germans, no crappy Americans. So far whoever plays the German side has a pretty boring time of it. Fall back, play for time, use op fire.

So far it hasn't felt like there's much scope for interesting or innovative maneuver. I don't care whether that's unrealistic or ahistorical or whatever; I find it pretty boring with not terribly interesting choices to be made (especially for the Germans).

The Decoy counters work okay but aren't quite as Fog of War-y as I had initially expected.

The hexes acquire an unfortunate number of counters: two stacked infantry, each with their own suppression marker, their own Used marker, and heck, sometimes an artillery marker on top of all that. A stack of 7 counters in a single hex makes it harder than it should be to keep track of who has and hasn't moved and who is and isn't suppressed.

The suppression mechanic hasn't worked out quite as satisfying in practice and the theory sounded. Fully suppressed German units cannot pass any proficiency checks (Morale=1, Prof=4), meaning you walk up to them without fear. As the American the only reason to risk moving against Yellow suppressed units is the turn limit.

The artificial turn limit (a necessary evil in games, I understand, but I still don't like them much) is the only thing that has given the German's a chance in all three scenarios.

Purely as a game, I think Combat Commander makes a large number of contributions to the genre and it is a shame that subsequent games don't follow suit: VP tracks, lack of defined turn limits, secret/hidden/random objectives, random scenario generator.

It isn't ASL, but it is one of the better WWII tactical level games I've played.  Relatively simple and fast to play.

However, having said that, I sold my copy.  My main complaint is that every battle is fought on a tiny postage stamp sized map (hex number not hex size).  There is movement but no maneuver.  You always start toe to toe, and that gets boring.  The range of kinds of actions in the scenarios scenarios is quite limited.  The game just didn't have enough to keep my interest.

Update after solo play of scenarios 1, 2 and 4.  The system is pretty easy to learn and allows for combined arms (vehicles and artillery) to be integrated smoothly.  There are some interesting tactical decisions to make, but so far, it seems to lack much excitement.  There are no squads going berserk, no heroes taking out machine gun nests or pillboxes.  It plays like an army field manual, not a unit history or personal memoir.

Initial rating  based on solo play of learning scenario, reading the rules and scanning scenario book.

This is a lighter (for WWII tactical) squad level wargame.  It plays fast with clean rules.  Somewhat gamey to keep the rules level light (for example, halftracks disappear after dropping off troops, no more than one gun or vehicle in a 40 meter hex, etc...)  Plays like Panzer Grenadier's smaller scenarios, with no leaders (scenarios allow players to move multiple units in alternating impulses and the focus is on morale with suppression replacing disruption in this game).  Lacks the chrome of ASL starter kits (not to mention full ASL) but plays faster.  I'm looking forward to trying the larger scenarios, but even those have fewer units than the ASL starter kits.

IMHO the most realistic WWII tactical game. Period. It captures the fundamntally psychological nature of small unit combat. It also introduces a powerful form of battlefield chaos through command friction, that is you never quite know if a suppressed unit will act or not. The only suggestion I might make for gameplay improvement would be to integrate into the main game the random events that are only an optional rule right now. This would create yet more unexpected narrative like found in Squad Leader.

Wonderful new Tactical system!

Caveats:

I don't like the 10-sided dice system: they "roll" for too long compared to two six-sided dice, and there is still WAY too many dice rolls in the game!

The initial subject matter also lacks originality (not US Airborne AGAIN!?). 

This game system could easily become a "9".

RATING: N/A
Elegant, approachable, fast-paced tactical game that gets a lot of things right with rules that (usually) stay out of the way. 

An excellent morale mechanic highlights the unpredictability of troops under fire and puts the tactical emphasis on suppression and close combat (same hex). The highlight of the game for me is the way that it encourages spreading fire around to actual threats rather than piling up on an already suppressed or well dug-in unit in hopes of a KIA - no tactical game that I am aware of does this so effectively.    
 
The designer has gone for a very lean, focus-on-the-essentials approach and was quite successful in this goal. Basically, the only decisions a player needs to make for each unit is: move, and/or fire, or prepare for opportunity fire. While this is appealing on one level, and allows one to really focus purely on basic tactics, I also miss some of the details that this game intentionally leaves out - they are part of the fun for me and greatly add to the narrative effect of squad games. I can quite happily accept that this game wasn't meant to capture them and the pay-off in ease of play often seems worth the loss in detail, but the more familiar with BoB I become, the more it feels like a generic, tactical exercise instead of a game about WWII squad battles. 

Most scenarios are well designed (a few are not) and present interesting "tough nut to crack" situations that rely on limited turn numbers to achieve their tension. More variety in the scenarios would have been nice however and many of them begin right at the point of contact between the forces - there isn't much scope for maneuver or sneaking around for a better position.
 
Overall, I enjoy playing this game, it is very fun, and I recognize the innovative contribution it is to the genre - it won't be replacing its more detailed ancestors for me, but it deserves to be checked out even if you have a shelf full of tactical WWII titles.

This one seems a really good rendition of tactical combat in WWII. It has a simple set of rules and while playing you just think tactics, not rules. Of course, this means that there is not a wide assortment of tactics, it's basically covering fire, approach and kill or rout.

I was mainly attracted to the idea of hidden units (implemented here with decoy markers) but found it didn't add as much as I hoped. The game does a great job of retelling the stories of the Screaming Eagles as most famously seen in the Band of Brothers series, but otherwise there are better systems for this level and theater.

Rulebook is confusing and should have a better structure and more examples (and a revision). Player Aid Sheets are incomplete and a mess. The game is (in Europe) a bit overpriced compared to others that deliver more stuff with better quality.
Reduced rating to 6 after several plays: System seems to be much more fiddly and less elegant than I was told and hoped. Very mathy with a lot of modified die rolls and too much different modifiers. A lot of special rules for infantry, guns, and vehicles. As usual, OP Fire Mode mechanics are boring, but Final OP Fire is well done.
The whole concealment system is not my cup of tea, it is like Memory with fiddly components.
Game flows not very well for what we expected. No "wow"-effect until now like we got from other squad level games.
German infantry is nothing but a weak joke against American infantry titans with high morale and proficiency.
Some scenarios do not seem to be very balanced and/or are boring because the German player does nothing have to do than running away and staying alive.
Rating will be better if further plays are more exciting? Perhaps Ghost Panzer from the same author will be better.
We will see...

Excellent. I have not enough good words to proffer about this game: easy to teach, fun to play, mechs (!) in an easy compact way (ASL I'm looking at you...), interesting maps, great rulebook... Well done.

On the downside, unfortunately, the quality (counters) is not that high as the best GMT standard and that's a huge pity, because with a little bit more effort this game could be a classic. I also miss the scenario richness of Combat Commander.

A note, the counter design changed with the 2nd game in the serie... So probably when it'll reach a definitive form, I'll invest on it again.

Got the new version and the other two games in the series via the recent kickstarter from Worthington.  All three have nice components.  I am rating Screaming Eagles as it is the only one I have played so far.  Using cover and suppressing the enemy with firepower are very well simulated in this game.  In my early trial games I saw the punishing effects of units being caught moving in open ground.  I don't know if Worthington is still offering the kickstarter special but if you want some good squad level tactical games these are worth getting.  I have rated this higher than Academy games' Awakening the Bear and lower than Flying Pig's Old School Tactical but, in truth, the ranking could have been different if I had rated the others on a different day.  Buy them all if you can.  All three companies have planned or are producing series expansions and that's what we want, right?   A friend and I will be doing a marathon session of all three company's games in the next week.  Each game tries to simulate WW2 tactical fighting by focusing on different aspects so it should be an interesting gaming session.

After playing 5 scenarios of the new remastered edition, it's an excellent tactical system. For me it's historical accurate for tactical combat in WWII with the suppression fire. It's easy to learn and very fun to play. The components are high quality.  I've played numerous tactical games, ASL, ASLSK, L'NL, COH, CC, Panzer, and this system is one of the best. Very addictive!

Over here and way overpriced: the '3' counter sheets is in fact 2 large and one small. Further, one of the large sheets includes about 50pc blanks. The maps are flimsy and too light and actually consist of 5 mapsheets with different landscapes on either side. Fine, but I paid 49 quid for what looks and feels like a 32 quid package. Why the steep price?

This entry is updated from the 2014 record to reflect the release of the re-mastered edition and my rating has moved up from 8 to 9.

Excellent Squad level tactical game. The systems used make for realistic effects such as supression of the enemy being important before you move out into the open.

The subject is potentially complicated as evidenced by some other tactical games out there, but Jim has managed to get a full system including tanks, guns and artillery into a relatively short ruleset and there is staged learning (infantry only) to help.

The proficiency rule is superb as it is a single simple mechanic that abstractly covers so much right across the full game. For example it's use better shows the tactical capability and differences of self propelled guns, turreted tanks and elite crews of Tiger I's than gun / armour tables would alone do.

The artillery rules are only half a page long and do equally well as more complicated sets. The relationship between the rout and melee phases is also very clever.

Tank on tank combat is clean and straight forward and it works very well and the gun / armour / proficiency ratings feel right. I love the way for a 'knock out' that you are simply rolling against the difference of armour and gun ratings, having already determined the 'Capability' of the vehicle to make the shot.

It used to take a few games for the modifiers to become second nature because modifiers were not streamlined, but the new v2.1 rules deals with that and you are very much good to go within a few turns of playing.

My only niggle is that some of the scenarios make use of dummy units - these add some flavour in face to face games but generally are disappointing to the solitaire player (everything else handles well solitaire and there is in fact a specific rule suggestions as to how to handle decoys in solitaire play). There are ways around it that have been mentioned here on the forums and I generally trade them in for an actual unit (usually second line) or other appropriate advantage. In solitaire games, I like to play both sides equally and to the best that I can. I think the dummy notion is probably a hang-over from the days when this was initially a block game and really the game itself does not need dummies. 

This is a small niggle because there is a work-around but I would like to see future scenario's have an order of battle alternative for those times when you don't want to field dummies.

The maps are unusual in that they have an arty / cartoon look to them but this very quickly grows on you (I like the shade of green chosen) and now I think they are much more exciting to play on than some more 'drab' options avalable elsewhere. The inf counters are very nice. I would have prefered overheads of the armour rather than the 3/4 angle, but it works fine and for some of the vehicles, it helps with their visual character.

I have a long wargaming history of playing tactical games as my favoured genre and I would say that BoB comes closest to those exciting early days that I had when I first discovered Basic Squad leader. It is clever and fun to play.

Note the new editions use v2.1 rules and now all modifiers are made against unit values rather than the die roll.

RATING: 10
Squad-level wargame that works great with non-wargamers such as myself. The rules are simple but effective and logical. The scenarios are tense and engaging, and the rules coerce you into trying tactical play. Read the designer notes in the back of the rulebook before you play.

You know that episode of Band of Brothers where Winters & Co. smartly lay down a base of fire and execute flanking maneuvers in order to oust the Germans at Brécourt Manor? What is incredible is how Screaming Eagles elegantly forces such tactical play. Taking potshots at a distance is very unlikely to eliminate or reduce an enemy force in BoB; instead, players must first suppress the enemy, then move in for the kill. 

When a unit is suppressed, it is far less likely to be able to return fire, maneuver, or execute any number of actions. A fully suppressed unit (occurring when it takes very heavy fire or takes fire from multiple units) has a very, very slim chance of being able to move, and certain tasks like running & gunning are literally impossible for it to carry out.

The implication of this is that while charging gung-ho through the open towards a full-strength, unsuppressed unit is generally suicide (as I quickly learned in Scenario 1), smartly suppressing, surrounding, and then close assaulting a unit works brilliantly, just as it did in World War II--and all of this without a tome of rules and very few exceptions. While learning this game, these tactics simply naturally emerge from the players without their being forced upon you. It's really something.

The only caveat I have with the system is it's not extremely solo-friendly, but I overcome that by playing all enemy units as decoys and drawing chits or rolling dice when revealed to determine if it was real or not. Out of the box scenarios include 4-5 that I've enjoyed solo.

Update: We've started work on a card-driven AI system for solo play. It works well in pre-alpha so we're excited to see where it goes.

It would be nice if Judd was capable of just saying "I like the Band of Brothers system so much, it is my favorite system" without feeling compelled to insult everyone who likes Combat Commander. If you like a system, that is great and I am happy for you. You don't have to run down someone else's favorite game to make that point. Leave that to the ASL crowd, Judd. As for BoB, I invested in the Kickstarter revision that included all of th games but I'm deep into Old School Tactical now, so this will have to wait a bit before it hits the table.

RATING: 9.3
Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles is a new tactical World War Two game in what is already a crowded market, so crowded in fact that a game has to be quite different to really stand out.  Designed by Jim Krohn, Band of Brothers sets out to provide and interesting and challenging playing experience without becoming bogged down in rules and minutia.

The system itself is quite elegant.  Within a turn play alternates between the two players, who activate units to move or fire.  Each player has a minimum and maximum number of units they can activate before it is their opponents turn.  (This is called a sides Operations range.)  Once all units have been activated the turn goes into the rout phase, then the close combat phase and finally the recovery phase before a new turn begins.  Each player also has a limited number of Command Points they can use each turn.  Command Points allow a player to re-roll a morale check, re-roll a melee combat roll, move a unit from the side going second before the first player moves, and conduct Final Op Fire on a unit more than 1 hex away.

Vehicles and artillery add a touch more complexity to the system but nothing too serious.  Tanks are quite powerful and need the player to think seriously about how they are going to deal with them.

The game comes with some interesting design notes which do a good job of explaining why certain decisions were made.  I’m a sucker for these things, but I find it’s always good when a designer takes the time to try and explain what they want to achieve.  Some issues broached include, why there are no leader counters; each squad has an inbuilt leader.  Why foxholes are better protection than wooden houses; well dug foxholes are much harder for bullets to penetrate than wooden walls, and so on.

The physical quality of the game is good.  The counters are large and easy to read, with good artwork.  I found the map boards to be a bit cartoony in their art style to begin with, but this faded the more I played, they are also very sturdy.  The cover artwork is also striking and sets the mood for the game.

Overall I really enjoyed how the system plays.  I found the game play smooth and the rules very easy to follow.  This isn’t a complaint, more a comment on my preferences but I’m over the battles of paratroopers in World War Two.  Looking at my collection I can play ASL and ASLSK, Band of Heroes, Combat Commander and various Arnhem games if I want to re-fight these battles.  Instead I want something from left field, the Long Range Desert Patrol, SAS raids, Dieppe raid, Marines ... anyway just the grumbles of a lone wargamer.  Putting this aside, Band of Brothers is the start of a great system, I’m looking forward to further titles in the series.

I've only played several of the scenarios so far, but I really like it. Of course it sacrifices detail, but the gameplay is great. I appreciate that the designer has strong opinions about what is lacking in other squad level games. Plays very well solo even with decoys by using the designer's suggestions. My biggest quibble is the rule book isn't always sharp. Also, some my find it dry.

I really enjoyed this game.  I play most of my games solo. How does this game work solo.  I had no problems.  You have a lot of decoys and hidden units you can use or not.  I used them.  Sometimes my wife would set up the counters so I didn't know where they were.  Sometimes, I would set the decoys and just draw from a cup to find out what was there, or sometimes I just mixed them up myself.  Either way it seemed to work fine. It did give another element to the game that most don't have.  

The boards were fine, not the best, but not the worst.  I actually found them enjoyable.  I love the counters as they are very attractive and give a good feel of what you are doing.  I like that.

The game play is small squad stuff so nothing with a lot of units and big maps.  A different feel, quick and exciting.  I especially like the final op fire opportunity.  That is unique to this game.

Overall, a very fun and exciting game.

I really liked the concept and reasoning behind the systems, it sounds really interesting. But so far my plays have all been meh (my gaming buddy felt the same). I don't know why but right now I am not really motivated to give it another spin. So my rating is derived from my desire to play the game not so much on the actual mechanics which still intrigued but somehow did not click with me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Smooth mechanically, with minimal rules checks. The suppression mechanism is great, and it's probably more realistic than most other tactical games. Opportunity fire and final opportunity fire make moving against unsupressed units dangerous. Not wild about the armor rules which seem a little shoehorned to match the infantry game. The hidden units/decoys are very effective and add a nice fog of war element--didn't read much about this mechanic beforehand, but it's nice. The game plays very quickly and the learning curve is minimal.

Ein gutes Taktikspiel, das allerdings die "Combat Commander"-Reihe nicht wirklich wird gefährden können. Der Suppress-Mechanismus ist zwar nett ausgedacht und kann auch durchaus einen gewissen Realismus für sich in Anspruch nehmen - sofern ich das zu beurteilen vermag - dennoch springt bei mir der Funke nicht im erhofften Maße über. Was auch an den m.E. dann doch ein wenig zu komplizierten Regeln liegt. Was wiederum nicht besagen soll, daß die Regeln an sich kompliziert sind. Sie sind nur zu kompliziert für das, was sie tun.

Good minimalist-yet-realistic WW2 tactical system. I enjoy it.

If you feel that the dramatic chaos of Combat Commander, or the highly detailed chrome of Advanced Squad Leader, is essential, then you might find BoB too minimalist. I love Combat Commander, but BoB also works for me.

[b]Pros: [/b]
Simpler rules than most other WW2 tactical games, yet plausible/realistic seeming.
Geomorphic mapboards
Great support in forum from Jim Krohn (designer) and other players
Fun to play
(Meta): A good interesting thought-provoking explicit design statement, that realism is not the same as detail/chrome
Solos OK (i.e. playing both sides to watch the story unfold)

[b]Cons:[/b]
Chatty rulebook suboptimal as a reference manual during play
Goofy typeface and other graphic design issues, but that's a matter of taste
No random scenario generator (like Combat Commander's).
No true competitive-vs-AI solitaire rules (like Conflict of Heroes)

RATING: N/A
Interested in this because it's squad level, looks good, and has rules I almost understood on my first read. Not only that, but I really appreciate the stab at fog of war. As Jim Krohn explains in the designer notes, you still know way too much to get the command level uncertainty and risk taking of the real deal. That tension is what I want to find in a war game, as well as the uncertainty of whether your troops will perform. I didn't know that's what I'd like to see when I started to look into hex and counter wargames, but having seen this I love the approach. There's a greater emphasis on unit morale and how that's affected.

The major hitch with this game compared to others I've looked into is that the rulebook isn't very well organized. It could use more pictorial examples. Decoys and concealment tokens should be expained with the other components before they're referred to in the rules. Instead, they're only explained at the end. What you can do in the operations phase also made me do a double take, since the options aren't nested under the operations phase heading, but separated into their own units.

After all the warnings in the designer's notes about attacking across open ground, I was horrified to discover that MGs are nearly useless if they have more than two targets. Second play, my opponent pressed forward with nearly everyone against a narrow front, stopping his men in open ground to assault fire and heavily suppress all my front line elements. This did not impress either of us greatly. I do think that with what I know now I would have set up nearly everyone forward in a denser line, but I'm not sure the low-level mechanics pass the sniff test. Few games seem to get right the volume of fire that a defensive position can put out, and the resulting tactics always seem off. In addition, we only achieved a turn and a half in about two hours, after setup. The wristage got rather severe. At least mortars and guns do not add much rules overhead. 

I still want to try something with tanks, but my initial impression is mixed. Band of Brothers has some interesting ideas, but might not be enough of an advance in the genre to knock off exalted members of the existing pantheon of WW2 Tac gaming.

Provisional opinion.

Probably the best WW2 tactical game system yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Has perhaps the best ratio of simulation value to rules overhead of any game I've played.  While it takes 1-2 games to fully grok the various modifiers and their impact on play, once things snap into place, the game flows incredibly smoothly.  Arguably has fewer decision points than some other tactical games, but the decisions you have to make are invariably the right ones.  The only thing keeping BoB from being a 10 is my slight discomfort with the armor rules, but I think that's more a function of my inexperience with them, and that once I get them down, they will flow as smoothly as the infantry rules.

This is the best squad-level game on the market, and I eagerly look forward to the next installment.

RATING: 6.5
Although I think this is one of the better squad-based tactical wargames, the rulebook is terribly ambiguous and a pain to read, especially when having to look up something. I would go so far to say that the rulebook is one of the worst I ever read. I find this strange, because the rules for Space Empires 4X (also by Jim Krohn) are incredibly clear. The included player aid also doesn't help because its layout is quite confusing.

Update: downrated after several plays
- Most scenarios are one-sided and boring, especially for the defending player.
- The game's mechanics are very basic, nothing is ever happening except units getting suppressed under fire. Boooring.
- The rulebook is still (version 1.1) incredibly bad (no table of contents, no glossary, lack of coherence ...)
- The decoy markers are on the back of foxholes / tanks / guns, good luck not getting insane if you need all of those at once.
- SATW's cannot be fired from a building hex, making them pretty useless in nearly all of the scenarios.
- The game solely depends on die rolls for firing and morale/proficiency and hence is extremely luck-based.

Found this a bit too stop-start. Even after three games I was still double checking with my opponent if I was rolling for the right thing at the right time and checking tables for every roll.

Squad level wargame with some innovative features. What makes the game original is the introduction of a suppression mechanism, which results in units having several potential levels of attribute, and requires morale checks before they can carry out orders. The rulebook could have contained more detail and there is an absence of what would have been much appreciated examples of play. The components are of so-so quality and the maps in particular are a bit of a disappointment. Squad level combat games are becoming something of an overcrowded genre and I personally feel that there are better games out there than 'BoB' despite its attempt to bring something different to the mix ('CC:E', 'CoH', 'ASL' etc), but like many an innovator, this is a game that will be much copied and probably improved on in the future.

I really like what Jim Krohn does. I love Space Empires: 4X and when I heard about him working on a WW2 hex&counter game I was sold. I have a different series in my collection - Combat Commander - and those two are giving me all I want from tactical scale of combat. While CC is spectacular in creating an emotional ride of an ever changing war movie Band of Brothers is showing the less glorious but more realistic side of the combat.

The way how simply yet effectively the system works with morale is simply brilliant! You must think not only on how to attack the enemy, to pin him down and maneuver around him but also how to prevent him do the same. It's not that easy to kill a unit here, you have to lower the morale and make the unit unable to act or to follow simple orders. 

I owned the first edition but switched to the second edition for consistent and clarified rules and game components.

The unrevised proficiency check rules are pretty clunky. I can't wait for a reprint.

2nd game after Memoir and another level. More control, more strategie but still manageble for newer players. Would need another play and look at the rules to fully get into this one.

Okay game so far but rather dampened by the experience of buying it from NWS/Christopher Dean who lied about the game being in stock when it was still at the printers, implied that he was the only one who had it in stock and would be for an indeterminate amount of time, gave some pitiful excuse which basically boiled down to the lack of professionalism in the board game industry which in fact argued against him, which meant that I could have got the game quicker and cheaper without NWS having my money for three month if I have waited till it was in stock in the UK. Christopher Dean behaviour over the issue was such that I recommend avoiding NWS. Deeply suspicious is that the negative feedback that I left him has never appeared, invalidating his 100% positive feedback.

Massively overpriced, even by wargame standards. I wish GMT or basically any other company had produced this. I also wish there was more differentiation, more scenarios, more counters, just...more.

Barely played it, but it seems fine. I can see the designer's arguments about realism, but I think it has to be a fun game foremost, and I'm not sure it manages that. Everything's kind of bland and samey.

A nice, light game system that will find its place with tactical WWII games but I still prefer the mechanics of CoH over this one.  The simplicity of the rules is what makes this one shine. The components are nothing special though with thin cardboard maps and standard chits.

With a few more plays under my belt, I'm starting to see how this game shines. I really enjoy how the system makes you think about suppression to achieve your goal.

Luckily, I just found it at my FLGS! Seems to be 'out of stock' everywhere else. I'll rate after a few plays.

Update: seems a bit too fiddly. I much prefer Panzer Grenadier.

elegant tactical system.   Easy to learn yet complex enough to satisfy.  NO minutia of rules to constantly look up.  Fast playing games!  Be sure to get past the first three scenarios as they are training scenarios and do not have the depth the others do.   Object is to suppress your enemy before closing in for melee. However, even fully suppressed units have a 10% chance they may still pass a morale check and fire on you, so it is not necessarily a cake walk to advance on them, as they have a chance to fire at you moving in the open.  Moving in the open, adjacent to a unit is a near death march.

Really absorbing game play.  My son and I have had some real tense battles where it's come down to the last moved before we knew who won.

Decent enough squad level game, but not as good as hype would lead you to believe.  While fire suppression allowed for new strategies, you are making lots of morale checks.  Biggest issue with scenarios so far is getting everything done within the number of rounds vs surviving or being strong enough to win if there was an extra turn.  Decoys also add some strategy although they seem a bit gamey.

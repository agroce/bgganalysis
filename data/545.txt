LOVE it.  The 4 sets of pics/boards is nice, but the artwork (w/ a touch of topless female nudity) is something that probably wouldn't fly in the US.

Sure, you can get something (more or less) similar from Scrutineyes, but it's not the same.

RATING: 7
{1 play, 5 player} I can see that rating dropping after I get tired of the "scene" cards, but since I'll probably only play this once or twice a year, that may not happen for a while.  The game is fairly basic - really it's a board game version of I Spy, the car game you played on roadtrips - but the odd pictures are what make it work here - a weird and wonderful jam-packed melange of the ordinary and the strange.

Okay party game.  Search the picture for objects starting with "x".  My main complaint is that it can get quite subjective... there's always a player or two who likes to stretch limits of interpretation of objects (ex. this bird could be a sparrow... do you know what a sparrow in flight at a distance of 500 yards really looks like... neither do I... so it could be a sparrow... aaarrrggh!!).

RATING: 5
Interesting party type game and different enough to stand out from the pack.

Players have a set of 12 different paintings. At the start of each round, a spinner with all of the letters on the alphabet is spun, a letter is declared, and players then struggle to find as many things in the picture that start with that word as possible. The trick here is that creativity and attention to minutia generally are both very positive things in this game.

I don't think a game like this will ever really wow me, but Kaleidos is decent for its genre, and I wouldn't actively avoid playing it.

Oh yes, and playing with "body parts" as legal answers is completely compulsory for maximum enjoyment of this game...

Components: Player boards are packed with images that would make it interesting to examine even without being part of a game.

Experience: The time pressure inspires some very creative interpretations of the images, as players race their eyes around the board searching for words. Examining a board with a specific starting letter in mind ensures that each board will survive several plays before losing its newness.

Kaleidos has grown on me to the point where I won't openly scoff at playing.  The group will probably want some ground rules for what answers are acceptable.  Body parts?  Colors?  Abstract shapes?  Words with adjectives or other modifiers attached?

Rewards creativity and quick thinking. ... and having a mental stash of generic words like "PEOPLE" and "OBJECT" that apply to every scene.

Still, in the same way that half the fun of Anomia is in feeling one part of your brain freaking out that another part is lying down on the job ("Fish. Fish. Why can't I think of a fish. Is... chicken a fish? No."), it's fun to spend an entire 60-second round of Kaleidos flailing around and then hear people name valid words that were [b]right there in front of you the whole time[/b].

I understand that people that have played the original version may be partial to the old art, but after having looked at the pictures in this forum, I think I actually prefer the artwork of the more recent edition.

Initially perusing the boards, I thought that they were potentially too sparse, but they work just fine.  Given, it can be difficult to search for "x" or "z" words, but the timer is quick enough that if there aren't many words that are found, it's fine.

I can see how there is a serious need for agreement on the rules before you start the game, and every group will surely come up with its own house rules.  But I find that part of the arguing and retaliatory votes are part of the fun of the game.  In this respect it feels similar to Boggle, where some players will always come up with very questionable words.

1 partida.

Es como el Scattergories, en el que, a partir de una letra inicial, tienes que decir todas las palabras que se te ocurran con esa letra, pero en este caso restringido a las cosas que aparecen en la imagen.

Hay muchas cosas, pero también hay muchas letras y, a veces, es muy complicado encontrar palabras que empiecen con una determinada letra (sobre todo si empiezan por W, Q y similares, aunque siempre puedes sacar otra letra), que estén en la imagen.

No está mal, pero es una vuelta de tuerca a un juego muy típico y que, además, puede llegar a frustrar bastante.

RATING: 5
I thought is was going to be incredibly tedious and was surprised to find Kaleidos a much funnier game than I expected from reading the rules. The fun arises from the player's interpretations of the paintings and trying to justify their choices. The best point about Kaleidos is probably that you can play it with just about anyone.

RATING: 7

RATING: 8
Whether or not you will enjoy Kaleidos says less about how good a game it is (it's good) than it does about what kinds of games you like. While it is oversimplifying, it's not completely erroneous to call Kaleidos a port of the hidden object computer game genre into board games. If you like hidden object games (or puzzle games in general) there is a pretty good chance you will enjoy Kaleidos. If you find those kinds of games annoying, you may as well stay away.

Kaleidos comes with ten top notch, stylized cartoon illustrations that are jammed to the gunwales with items. Once each player is set up with the same illustration, a card is flipped up to choose a letter of the alphabet, and the players have thirty seconds to find as many items in the picture as they can that begin with the chosen letter. For each item that you find you score, in a Boggle-like fashion, 3 points if no other player has listed it and 1 point if another player has. Lather rinse and repeat, using each of the ten illustrations once.

The biggest point of departure from hidden object games – outside of the competitive aspect – is that there is room for ingenuity in Kaleidos. Where hidden object games prescribe which items you have to find, you have a looser mission in Kaleidos, and it's perfectly likely you will score for the same object under different letters due to synonyms and categorical labels. Again, this will be a big selling point for some, and a turn off for other people.

It might seem like ten pictures would not offer a lot of replayability, and imagine that is true if you played it several times each week or if it saw several nights of heavy repitition in a short span. With more casual play, though, changing which letter you are looking for is plenty to keep the game fresh. There is a fan-made "expansion" pack of pictures, though, if you do find yourselves engaged in hardcore play.

Also, the version I played did not include English rules, but I've covered everything you need to know here, so that's not a big problem.

The game is simple: stare for 45 seconds (?) at a painting and write down as many things that you can that begin with a particular letter.  Everyone has a copy of the same painting which depicts hundredss of different objects.  Score big points if you're the only one that came up with a word or if a majority of the players came up with that word.  I'm probably always going to lose this game but there's something addictive about it that I enjoy.  The trick is to be able to see an object and interpret it in many different ways.  Wish the time was about 30 seconds longer.

An alpahbetical "Where's Waldo?" Given one of a dozen pictures, players attempt to write down everything they see in the pictures that start with a letter freshly chosen by a spinner. You have about a minute for the timer to run out. There are a lot of arguments about what counts as a duplicate (Person and People both begin with P), and whether a word is really applicable (is someone grasping a handlbar showing a Fist?). Same answers by multiple players score zero.

Cute Party game.  Try to find words in pictures that start with a certain letter.  Creativity and quick thinking are a distinct advantage.  

I would prefer if you were given twice the length and just used the same image for the entire game.  Often you have to pick one section to dissect, trying to disseminate all the information, and that section just won't be as rife with possibilities as other sections. 

All in all, enjoyable.

Kaleidos is a party game where everyone looks at the same cluttered picture, you roll a die to determine a letter, and everyone writes down all of the items starting with the designated letter that they see in the picture. The game was fun, but the scoring system was a bit strange. You get 5 points if you’re the only one to spot something, otherwise you get a number of points equal to the number of people that spot it, so if one other person saw it then you drop from 5 down to 2 points, but if three other people saw it then you get 4 points. Seems a bit inverted and definitely punishes those who miss the most obvious items as those end up being the most valuable. I’m sure it wouldn’t be too hard to come up with variant scoring that was more intuitive and matched the straightforward gameplay better.

Played the newest edition by Cocktail Games.  I enjoy the frantic nature of the gameplay as you race against time to come up with things in the picture that start with the letter chosen.

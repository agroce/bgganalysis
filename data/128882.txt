I love bluffing, lying, talking, interacting, deducing, betraying... and Avalon has it all in a very replayable, fast-paced mix.

RATING: 8.5
The flagship social deduction game for a reason. For me this improves greatly with close friends and family - I'm not the most social butterfly and can shut down a bit when playing this with people I know less well. Nowadays I think I prefer ONUW's more dynamic nature but will still happily play this anytime

151117  Rating just the Merlin mechanic.  I really hate it now in minds eye.  You don't play a bleeping game just to have it end on coin flip.

130923 This rating might go up in the future if I ever get bored with plain resistance.  However, until then, the Merlin mechanic is somewhat problematic.  It kind of ends the game with a 1/X chance of not losing. Furthermore I have participated in a couple games where it was almost ruined by a premature reveal of the merlin or other characters. I just prefer the basic asymmetric (if its real) balance of plain resistance.

Fantastic game for a large group (6+). I can see how this might not work if people are reluctant to lie about their identities, but most folks warm up to the game pretty quickly. 

It's a 9 for me, and much better than Werewolf or Mafia where people get eliminated early on. I would recommend the  Avalon version over the base game.

LIKE: it's the "role" game I like the best. Players have more options on their turn to think about. Merlin is fun.
DISLIKE: acting is needed.

OVERALL: I hate werewolf. This isn't as bad as werewolf, because having a task and being on teams makes the game less confrontational.

RATING: 6
Not much to catch me with this. The Resistance was a fine alternate to Werewolf, but these social lying games aren't really a style of game I enjoy. The implementation of this one doesn't distinguish itself from others at all - being only a retheme with slight variations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
Fun can vary with the crowd. 

Best played with competitive players.

Do not play well as a party game: 'trolling' will take away from the fun, as it handicaps one or both teams.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very similar to Werewolf but I much prefer the latter one. In Resistance the dynamics of the group does not evolve throughout the game since no characters get killed. Once you have worked out who the bad guys are, it's a simple task for the good to win.  I also find kind of lame that the only way the good players get to contribute to the outcome of the game is the voting for the group that goes out for a mission. In werewolf you at least get to execute other players.

I guess that the designers wanted to have a Werewolf without player elimination but at the same time you agree with sacrificing the very best part of the game. Must be that I am a werewolf.

Good game (just reskin of Resistance with a small expansion). The Merlin character makes this game better than base game Resistance, although I prefer the spy theme of Resistance so for me Resistance plus expansion is superior. If you're only going to buy one box though buy this one.

RATING: 8.5
I don't usually enjoy social deduction games, but this is for sure the best one I've played so far. My biggest complaint about this kind of game is the usual absence of a solid mechanic beneath all the talking, lying and bluffing... which makes the game-play too intangible - so to speak - for me, since the players can only rely on their ability to read other people's faces.

The Resistance is different, even if it's still really simple and straight-forward. The key to its trick is the addition of the voting phase, because it really allows to read the other players's intentions and brings a huge deal of discussion to the table every time. This simple mechanic makes the game very deep and interesting! I also like the fact that all the players are involved at all times... unlike Werewolf, a game which is often compared to Resistance, where players are killed off turn by turn.

The Resistance is a really great game... and one I'm growing more fond of play after play. The Avalon version introduces some really cool roles, that make thing even more interesting and even more tense! Finally I've found the social deduction game that I enjoy. Huge thumbs up for me!

Very similar to basic Resistance (duh!) but the extra roles add some depth. I'm hoping to get in a good session where I get to play with them. 

This version adds Percival specifically, which gives another role for the good guys to play as. And, although my first play didn't get to use it, Lancelot, Excalibur, and lady of the lake add more things to give information to the good guys.

All in all, whether this stays a highly rated game for me depends on how hard it is to get it to the table.

I rated Resistance, the original, a 10.  We love it.  But for some reason, even though many people like this more, and even though it has more complexity and things to consider, I don't like this as much.  I usually just play it vanilla, using these cards because my resistance cards are worn out.

RATING: 10
The Resistance is fantastic with an energetic group of folks and the roles work so much better than the plot cards from the base game. They add information to the game in a more predictable, organized way, and they help folks realize the information and strategy inherent in the game.

I still think that, regardless, there is a lot of data to process (and that the first mission team shouldn't automatically be accepted and that the first mission should necessarily automatically succeed or whatever), but the roles do help this reality set in.

It does, as many games of this ilk, suffer if all players aren't all expressive, and the less sociable can get a bit suppressed, but otherwise great fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A medieval shouting match best reserved for 8+ players.

Avalon can work with gamers and non-gamers alike but will deflate without charismatic player participation.
I recommend finding a group it works with then sticking with them.

A handful of interesting player powers and the quick-ish play time make Avalon a game that will get multiple plays before closing the box for the night.
One of the best social deduction games out there.

RATING: 8
The Resistance is a game modeled on Werewolf but with more information on which to base your deduction, no player elimination, and no need for a GM.  Which is all  good in my book. Avalon adds the Merlin character, who operates like the Seer and makes this version even more Werewolfy.  I have found both versions of The Resistance somewhat fragile.  If luck gifts one side an early advantage, it can be over quickly and unsatisfactorily.  On the other hand, it frequently delivers as concentrated a shot of bluff, deduction, paranoia and double-think as you can reasonably expect of a thirty-minute filler.

I rather liked the futuristic resistance cell setting of the original and this Arthurian re-theming makes somewhat less sense.  The art and production are both good.  The rules are clear enough.

RATING: 7.5
What's the saying? Sometimes you feel like a nut... and sometimes you don't? That's how I feel about this. Adding more (and more) information to Resistance can be fun, but it can also be crazy intimidating.

The Resistance is one of my favourite games and Avalon is even better, with nicer components, gorgeous artwork and some interesting options and twists with Merlin and the Assassin adding extra tension.

For those not familiar with The Resistance, Avalon is a social deduction game where players assume secret identities competing as teams to either cause missions to succeed or fail.  The best 3 of 5 wins for the particular side.  

Deceptively simple on the surface, easy to setup and a breeze to learn, the real fun comes from the player interaction involving accusations and bluffing as each person tries (with very limited information) to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  Works best in a group willing to "talk it up" and I guarantee you'll spend twice as long afterwards laughing and dissecting the tactics and accusations.

Small, cheap with a play-time of around 15-20 mins (depending on group chatter), it covers groups from 5-10 players with no player elimination.  Avalon is a hands down winner and one of those rare games that is as near to perfect as I can find.

I have to admit that I never found the concept of the Resistance all that compelling. It seemed too simplistic as is. The addition of all the roles in Avalon though, most notably Merlin, takes the game to the next level though. I have now played this game quite a bit and I don't think I have ever had a non-stellar game. Any hidden role game that causes me to turn to a team mate as soon as its over and say "I'm Merlin dumb***" is aces in my book.

I may be jumping the gun a little here putting this straight into my top 10. I’ve only played the original Resistance a handful of times and thought it was an average game. I’d played it in the past at my local game club and never really considered purchasing it. Then one week I sat down and out this came. I knew nothing of it. After about 3 or 4 games I loved it! 

All the little faults I didn’t like about the original have gone. The components could have been better. You’ll age the cards by just looking at them. This rating has the potential to go up or down. I’m not very experienced with the game, its intricacies and how it will hold up to repeated plays with roughly the same group so I doubt it will settle here. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm actually not a huge fan of the inclusion of a random win chance for the minions, although the idea of roles in general is well received.  Honestly though, something about it doesn't "click" the same way as the original.  The components are an excellent upgrade though, particularly the voting tokens.

Gave to a friend because I didn't really need 2 copies of The Resistance, and it would allow more circles to enjoy the game.

The game mechanic is pretty simple but the strategies that can be applied are several, though it is a lot up to the players how to play it out and win at the end.  
This is not very dissimilar to other games (werewolves, for example) that though can be easily played without having to purchase a game set.  So the game set should add much more to it.

I was a huge Mafia fan since the 90s. This has taken over that spot. I'm willing to play this virtually anytime I get the chance.

I recommend Avalon over the base version of Resistance. I have both, but I prefer Avalon. They can be played together, but I'm not a huge fan of the leader cards (they overcomplicate a game that excels due to it's simplicity).

RATING: 9
A redesign of The Resistance with a new theme. It adds a bunch of special roles with abilities that some feel makes the game more fun. In actuality, it makes the game more chaotic while at the same time giving more information to select players. This causes many players to use the roles as a crutch rather than resort to the pure social deduction of the original Resistance. It's still a great game, but the original design is a masterpiece.

I like it as much as The Resistance, though it does have the benefit of those extra roles...something the other game has since corrected with its new expansions. Anyway, if you feel like you'll have a crowd that can't commit to the dystopian future theme, the Arthurian skin might just do the trick. Just as treacherous and deductive.

RATING: 8.7
When we first started playing Resistance, it was at restaurants with a plain deck of cards (black means good and red means spy.) I didn't even know that it was an official, published game--this was before I was even aware of designer board games, BGG, and all that jazz.  This game changed that.

I was blown away by how much intensity emerged from such a simple ruleset. As a spy, this game makes me set personal records for dirty, rotten lying.  Not the trivial kind of lying in poker, where you can simply stay quiet and let your chips do the talking.  You have to feign indignance when others accuse you of being a spy.  You have to fake delight when your spy brethren are backed into a corner.  Lots of people just can't stomach this intensity.  I view it as a valuable skillset--one that had lain dormant until I found this game.

The added roles in Avalon do improve the game slightly (although I hear there is an expansion to the sci-fi themed version that includes said roles and more.)  Perhaps even more than the roles, the Lady of the Lake is a very welcome addition, providing a nice amount of concrete evidence to supplement the gut feelings.  But really though, I will never turn down a game of resistance, in any of its incarnations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The Resistance, with some additions. I've only played with Merlin/Assassin added in so I don't know what the other roles do, but I think I'd be more inclined to pick this up than normal Resistance due to the theme.

2015: Playing with more of the roles leads me to think that most aren't really that worthwhile. The Merlin/Assassin pairing does change the game enough to be almost automatic when players all know the game.

Very similar to The Resistance, but while the original does not have very good expansion options (those additional roles are crap) Avalon feels like a legitimate expansion to the original.

Compared to the Resistance, I think this variant/version is a bit more refined than the base game. And while Avalon includes less content than the base game (no plot cards), the included variants seem more balanced. For that reason, I view Avalon as The Resistance 2.0. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As many people have said, it cuts off all the fat from Battlestar Galactica, while retaining the core ideas of cooperation amongst possible betrayal, and trying the deduce the identities of the traitors (or trying to evade deduction in case of the traitors). I find it easy to get into the flow of it, unlike Battlestar. Great social game with a good bit of strategy.

I always have just played this as straight resistance so I can't comment on the extra roles and snazziness that distinguishes Avalon from regular old Resistance.  SO this really more of a comment on that game.

Resistance is a great step up from Standard Werewolf.  The first turn is still a little pointless (since the traitors pretty much never reveal themselves in the opening round), but overall it's much more focused than Werewolf.

I personally am not a HUGE fan of this style of game.  I appreciate it for the sort of experience it can bring out and will gladly play it as filler but I get burned out after a couple of games.

The other issue is that newer games of a similar style are arguably better.  Both Coup and One Night Ultimate Werewolf seem to go further in distilling this "hidden traitor" or bluffing/deduction game down into it's purest and most enjoyable elements. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The best deduction game ever made (*I've played). The game can be as complex or as streamlined as you like because the core mechanics are golden. Muddy things up with Mordred and Lady of the Lake? If you like. Play clean and simple with the 4 base power roles? Sure. The scaling seems very balanced, with things only getting 'goofy' with 9-10 players, but there's a certain fun in goofy oversized games. If you like deduction games, you'll love Avalon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Excelent design. One of the best games out there. This is the game I've played the most so far (excluding IOS plays and online plays).
We never play just once, we usually play more than 4 times, it's just that good. Even better than 'the resistance'. Awesome game in a small package.

You can play this anywhere, almost no table space is needed. Very few and simple rules. The Merlin (good) and the Assassin (evil) players are always present, and then there are more characters which you can add to scale the game easier or harder for each faction (good or evil). You have Percival, a good player who knows who the Merlin player is, you have Mordred an evil player that Merlin is unaware of, Oberon, an evil player that the evil players don't know who he is, and other special characters. High replayability overall. High recommendation.

Az első Resistance-hez képest csak annyi újdonság van benne, hogy megjelennek a szerepek, de szerintem ez nagyon nagy különbség! Mi csak a 2 legalapabb spec személyt próbáltuk (5 fővel), de egyszer feltétlen ki szeretném próbálni 10 fővel, több speciális személlyel. Régen sokat gyilkosoztunk. Aki azt szereti, az ezt is fogja. Néhány nagy előnye az Avalonnak (és a sima Resiscance-nek is, bár a szerepek miatt az Avalon közelebb áll hozzá) a gyilkossal szemben:
1. Nem kell egy fix mesélő, mindenki játszik.
2. Nem lehet kiesni a játékból (a gyilkosban nagyon kínos, amikor valakit kinyírnak az elején, és ott ül 1 óráig kukán).
3. Mesélés csak az elején van, így nem lehet 40 perc játék után, az utolsó kör előtt hibás meséléssel elrontani az egészet!!
4. Több kézzelfogható információ van, emiatt kevésbé káoszos, bár ez már ízlés kérdése, hogy valakinek bejön-e.

Nagyon nagy ötletnek tartom, hogy Merlinnek titokban kell tartani a szerepét.

Avalon is the same exact game as the resistance, with the addition of special roles.
In other words, is a refined, shorter version of Werewolf, without player elimination.

I can see how this game won't charm the hardcore German gamer: it is just a social experience of bluffing, lying and deduction. With a good addition of shouting.

It probably will fall flat with the wrong group, and the first play will probably raise eyebrows with any group... But it still is a good game, short and playable with an unusual range (5-10) of players.

Initial Impression: There's alot of game in such a small box. Layer upon layer of bluffing, double bluffing, and overall intrigue. This game is best played with more people as more roles are filled. In some ways, this game has some similarities to Battlestar Galactica, in particular the mission phase. I've enjoyed our plays of the game and as the game is so short, it begs to be played repeatedly in an evening. I'm very tempted to add this game to my collection.

15 year old daughter believes it is a 10 out of 10, I would give it an 8 out of 10.  Merlin is a difficult player to play especially for new or younger players and so this sometimes makes it frustrating playing the good guys.  I really think 8 or more players is needed and so a great party game.  I can't convince anyone so far to add the other characters as I think this may help balance this issue of Merlin.

Down from an 8 to a 6. Truthfully, this should be rated even lower, as I would never play this version if the original with plot cards were available. 

Old Comment: Like I expected, this is a step in the wrong direction. Signaling, logic, and deduction start to take a back seat to intuition.

It's still Resistance, and for that it deserves an 8. But if you have the choice, purchase 2nd Edition normal The Resistance.

I can imagine this would not be good for people who struggle with lying, but otherwise it is a very entertaining large group game that has always been well-received. YOU LIED... TO. MY. FACE. YOU BASTARD. I have personally branded someone 'The Traitor' as I simply cannot look at him without feeling the scalding pain of his two-faced lies (in a good way...).

RATING: 9.5
I believe I initially rated this game a 7, but as I have played it more and more I have gradually adjusted my ranking up, up and up. The game really only gets better with time and better as you and the people you play it with gets better at playing it.

Beginners might quickly "give up" if outed as evil and that's the one thing you should never do in this game (unless you really are DEFINITIVELY outed beyond doubt). Once players learn the right mentality for this game it gets beyond awesome. And be sure to use as many of the fun special roles as possible. I like to have at least 7 people playing. If three evil players are needed we will go with Mordred, Morgana and Oberon - if 4 add Assassin. Good always has Merlin and Percival. We really like to play with Lady Of The Lake - especially at higher player counts and Excalibur can be fun too.

For now, the rating stands at 9.5. I'm still reluctant to give it the full 10...but time will tell. For far it has only gotten increasingly better after 91 plays.

One caveat. You need the right group. I prefer to play this with my students (I am a high school teacher). I will not play it with my family. Your family might be different to mine, but this game invites deception, blatant lying, backstabbing and shittalking. Fun, fun, FUN with young people - wouldn't do it with my family. When I started playing this game I was actually terrible at lying. I was OK at playing good, but awful at playing evil. This game has pretty much taught me how to lie convincingly and I am now a pretty good evil player. Maybe not a good thing as such, but lots of fun in the right gaming session.

RATING: 9
My absolute favorite social game. Always a big hit with gaming veterans and newbies alike. If you can play with a semi consistent group with some new blood sprinkled in you are in for some deeply layered metagaming. My favorite player counts are 6-8.


[i]Edit[/i]: I'm updating this entry. I still love the Resistance: Avalon, and consider it my favorite social game. One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Spyfall are climbing, though. I still think Resistance: Avalon is good for both veterans and newbies, but I've become a little turned off to it with certain groups of people because of how they play. They get a bit too locked in to "this is the only way to play" and control the conversation and flow, as if you have no room for alternate strategy and mind games. I still play my mind games anyway, bwahahaha. But it does suck out some of the overall fun...


[i]Edit 2[/i]:  Played again for the first time in a while at 6 players, and it reminded me exactly how much I adore this game. 


[i]Edit 3[/i]:  Okay, fine. It's equal to One Night Ultimate Werewolf. One is deeper, one is arguably more pure fun.

I've played The Resistance many times (14 plays logged) but given the chance I'll choose Avalon every time (21 plays and counting). I love the complexity that introducing only two roles (Merlin and the Assassin) adds to the game. And even more roles are included. I don't actually love the theme (Arthurian vs dystopian Sci-Fi) as much, but the upcoming expansions for the Resistance should fix that.

This is my go-to game for 6-10 new players, though I wouldn't mind splitting into two groups as well.

Tentative rating, as I’ve played Avalon with the basic rules only, the same ones as the original Resistance. I’d really wish I had tried at least a few of the new abilities as well: sadly though every game I’ve had so far was with players talking several different languages but none that was known by everyone, thus we have been forced to keep it as simple as possible.

A great game for 5-9 people (10 is possible) with hidden roles. Simple gameplay, most of the game is talking, accusations, and figuring out who is who. 

Your group is trying to complete quests but there are traitors in your midst, some people know some information, no one knows everything, and many people know nothing. 

A fun game to play with a larger group. Can be pretty exhausting for introverts, but it's a very fast game to pick up and teach

RATING: 9
This is a modern classic for a reason. I am a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica and the description of this game as "Pocket Battlestar" is apt. It carries some of the same, fun social misdirection games in a tight footprint of mechanics, rules and gameplay. The only criticism I could imagine for the game that it doesn't seem to have the kind of weight of having your success matter the way longer games like Battlestar do; it plays so quickly that it seems like you're playing about air; the deception is just for its own sake. That said, I can't imagine that anything else would be possible with a game lasting thirty minutes so that's not a fair criticism ultimately. Virtually every gamer should own this title. It fills a niche so perfectly that I can't imagine another title doing so in an improved fashion.

The Avalon version of the game is superior to the original Resistance in every way. Having the Merlin character makes the game so much richer. The theme works a little more cleanly to those new to the game. The mods available are easy to insert and remove. This game essentially creates a richer game of Werewolf with ten or fewer people and deserves its place as a modern classic.

Semi-cooperative game of blind-man's bluff. It felt to me like the deductive element from "Battle Star Galactica" (who are the Cylons?) turned into a game in its own right and re-themed to the Arthurian legend, although almost any theme  could work just as well. Plays quickly - an alright filler, nothing more. It won't be replacing "7 Wonders" as my go-to filler.

Liked this better than original, with Merlin and most other characters. Percy seems too subtle, so will have to play him more before evaluating. The game is great with any type of gamer - very versatile with the optional characters. Scales very well with the range of players from 5 to 10. Played with 10 once, and thought it worked well, but I think Lady of the Lake is needful for 9 or 10 players. Like 8 or 7 player games best, but will play with any number.

Fantastic hidden role/social/deduction game.

Kills something like werewolf or mafia for me because it actually gives you information to look at and examine while trying to decide who's lying.

I have not actually played vanilla Resistance, but I can't imagine it being better than Avalon. The extra roles in Avalon make it a blast. 

We always play with Merlin/Assassin (obviously), and Percival/Morgana. With 5 people it means everyone but 1 has a special role and the mind games that the roles add absolutely makes the game a success in my book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great party game for a 6-10 player group. It requires a higher level of concentration than games like Werewolf, and the voting mechanic really makes for some fun arguments. I'm listing it as light-medium, but that's debatable. I just know that I'm not a moron, and it still took me 5-ish games to figure out what the hell was going on. And even then, it took me another 10 or so games to start to really grasp the core tactics and strategy. 

This game really tests your memory, and you'll often find yourself doing silent logic problems to weed-out the traitor. To me, it's like having a highly structured game of Werewolf with an equally cool theme.


VERDICT:

If you have a 6-10 person group, you can't really beat this for a filler. Additionally, it's really hard to turn down a game, as they take practically no time at all. I also don't see any reason to play the original, generically-themed Resistance if you have this game as an option. Camelot is a timeless theme that almost everyone loves!

This genre has had so many newcomers in the last few years that I haven't played this in a while, but my copy is nearly worn out anyways. What a brilliant take on werewolf. No player elimination, faster gameplay, but it is missing the beautiful story arc that werewolf has. This game is just pure manipulation. It does often come down to whether the minion can lie, which I find delicious... but it might not be your thing. Make sure you roleplay your missions, as without that, I could see this game being a bit drab and dull at times. It can start to become solved with veteran players, but the evolving metagame is just one of the pieces of the never ending head-games that this box packs. A great gateway game too (for outgoing folks).

I am of the minority that I really prefer the base game Resistance, which is more of a pure deduction game. I rate The Resistance highly at 9.

Avalon mutates into a BS role playing game where all the rebels and spies pretend to be Merlin. OR Merlin stays quiet and it's not much different than vanilla Resistance.

Way too much WIFOM. Plain o' rebels have to filter through the fog of spies and an UTR Merlin.

Don't like it when Merlin, Percival and rebels can end up taunting the spy players. It's a role reversal and highly anti-thematic.

Definitely prefer the sci fi theme of Resistance.

The new roles add variety to the original game. I like to play with the new roles, but most of my group said they prefer the base game. That fact that the evil forces get a free shot winning by killing Merlin is a bit strange, although it plays out rather nicely as it's never just a random guess but always influenced by what the players said during the game.

I much prefer the original theme though. I added the new roles to my original print-and-play copy in the resistance vs. spies theme.

we love playing our own game very similar with cards so I was really excited to play a version with characters, unfortunately your character is hidden as well so there's really no point... also for me having Merlin changes the dynamics in a way that makes it less fun for me, and the instructions with this are terrible and the phrasing on the hidden role cards has ended up resulting in accidental spoilers -could probably be solved with a player cheat sheet which I really feel should've been included with this.

I'm just not a fan of the Werewolf-style genre, with the whole secret identity good guy vs. bad guy thing.  The bluff/double bluff thing where there's the constant back and forth of "I'm one of the good guys!"... "no, I'm one of the good guys!", repeat repeat repeat just doesn't grab me.

Now, I do score this better than Werewolf because:

a) There IS room to deduct and actually figure things out potentially in this one.  It's not 100% guesswork based on how you feel you might be reading people.

b) It's short, and therefore tolerable to play for something that I don't really like.

If you like this sort of game, I'm sure Avalon is great.  Just not my cup of tea.

Merlin RUINS this game. Because Merlin knows who all the baddies are right from the get-go, you HAVE to have a rule that makes up for it to prevent him from being OP. So they do. It's just a sucky, sucky rule.

It feels incredibly anticlimactic when the bad guys win AFTER they've lost the game already just because they guessed who Merlin was.

Guys, if you wanted to have some of the fun of the seer role in Werewolf... you could have just copied the role. Make them guess over the course of rounds who's evil, then you don't need some lameass end game rule to make up for it and even things out.

Apart from Merlin, this game is just The Resistance again with a bunch of variants we've never felt the need to try. Maybe I'll try them someday, but for now I'm happy sticking with The Resistance.

I was very hesitant to play this as I had played Werewolf many years ago and hated the experience.

I had a great time playing The Resistance though. It adds structure that makes decision making more logical, requires way more cunning, and keeps everyone in the game the entire time. I think the logical aspect - who voted for the mission/mission success or failure, who leaders send on missions etc. spices up the accusations and arguments and requires some really fun metagame aspects - this is a game that demands to be played multiple times consecutively. It is a game that seeds deep paranoia about your own behavior - you constantly think you are betraying yourself. Fun stuff!

I don't often have 7 players who fit the mold for this game, but do occasionally and it is perfect for those situations.

I do like The Resistance. Not as much as many others as I don’t actively seek it out, but I do enjoy it when I finally play it. I was looking forward to see the changes in this game. After playing, I don’t think I need to own this as I already own The Resistance, but I also think that Avalon might be slightly better due to the various roles. I didn’t care much for the special cards in The Resistance, so I don’t mind that they aren’t available in Avalon. Instead, they have added the secret roles which I found to be quite interesting, though I “only” got to be Morgana and a knight in my two games (oh boy was I glad I wasn’t dealt the Merlin character card as I was playing against guys with tons of games under their belt)! 

One thing I have to say is that the consensus in my big gaming group is that the Assassin is too powerful and that the evil forces often win because of this character; therefore, they play with the rule that the Assassin must make his accusation before the decisive mission! This way the Assassin is more likely to miss. In any case it is a fine game and I guess it’s better than the original Resistance (which you can also play using the Avalon cards, you just don’t have access to the plot cards).

I played the original Resistance 10+ times and rated it a 9, so naturally I'm inclined to rate this game highly as well. I traded for this rebooted version simply to get the role cards.

Heck, the games are so similar that it's really splitting hairs regarding which is better. I actually liked the plot cards, but I can see where those cards are clunky, especially for new players.

This is my favorite hidden role/deduction game. It's also a fantastic game for a lunch hour at work.

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]A high player count can often lead to problems as many of our usual games don't support more than 6.  Avalon plays nicely and scales to 10, but most of our games have been 7 or 8 and without the majority of additional characters.  Bluffing your way to the end is great fun.  I still think the first turn is incredibly limited, as you'd rarely fail the first quest and learn little.

[b]Still Play Regularly? - [/b]An occasional treat.

A light, fast, and fun game of social deduction.  We started awkwardly, but once everyone began chattering the game really blossomed.  Sadly, it appears that Indie is not going to support Avalon going forward.  Luckily, they've incorporated the lessons they learned here into newer editions of The Resistance.

Update 5/13: This one is actually considerably better than the original. The different characters force you to consider the different perspectives more carefully - what do you know about people, what do they know about you, what does everyone think they know. Forget your plot cards, characters are where it is at!

Original: Rated slightly lower than the original because guessing who Merlin is is just way too high a probability. It just seems to give the spies too much of a shot. We'll see on more plays if the sheer awesomeness of being Merlin overcomes that factor.

I've played both Avalon and Vanilla Resistance hundreds of times.  It is my favorite game system, by far.  I think Avalon is superior to Vanilla Resistance in everything but the theme.

The thing I like best about Avalon is that it has an extreme level of customizability.  You can play Vanilla Avalon with just Merlin and Assassin, or you can have a full-blown Avalon experience by adding in Lady of the Lake, Excalibur, the Lancelots, Mordred, Percival, Morgana and Oberon.  You can use any subset of these and each configuration plays differently.

Moreover, the Merlin mechanic levels the playing field.  Now both sides, minions and knights, have reasons to both lie and deduce.  This makes an already fantastic game of social deduction even better.

Whenever I go back and play Vanilla Resistance now, I just wish I were playing Avalon instead, and so will most likely always want to play it over the base game.

This is a great social deduction game for large groups.  Though it can be played with as few as 5, I think the sweet spot is 7-10.  If alcohol is involved, the game goes up a notch in my experience.  At least among my groups, people get more invested in winning when a bit tipsy.  The fact that it is in a small package makes it easy to transport.  I think a good social deduction game is a must for any proper board game collection, and Avalon is a dang good choice for that purpose.

A kerekasztal lovagjai (és Merlin) megpróbálják szent küldetésüket teljesíteni. Ámde beférkőztek közéjük a gonosz Mordred árulói is, akik fő célja Merlin meggyilkolása, de már azzal is elégedettek, ha a küldetést megbuktatják.

Szóval van két csapat: A meg B. A tagjai mind ismerik egymást, B tagjai közül egy kiemelt játékos van (Merlin), aki tudja, hogy kik az A tagjai. Ha A tagjai rájönnek ki Merlin a játék végén, mindenképp ők nyertek. Ha az 5 körből álló küldetések közül legalább 3 megbukik, szintén az A csapat nyer. Ha 3 küldetés sikerül és Merlin nem bukik le, B csapat nyer. Ez az alapjáték, ezt lehet bonyolítani további szerepekkel amik még asszimetrikusabbá teszik az információk áramlását.

Nagyon jó kis hazudós, titkos szerepes játék, persze - mint a Secret Hitlert - ezt is jobb többen játszani. Minél többen, minél több extra szereppel, annál jobb.

This game can hurt feelings (accusing your friends and loved ones of being a liar).  Also winning does not feel very satisfying since it is a group thing and the groups change randomly round after round. I can see the appeal in this game for others, but it is one that I really hate and I am known to turn down a game night if this game is scheduled to be played.  For a hidden role game, Spyfall is much more fun and creative and much less hurtful.

The Resistance was good, Avalon takes it to the next level. Before, the Resistance played a game of deduction whilst the spies played a game of misdirection and subterfuge. With the addition of merlin, now the spies need to play a detection game as well, whilst the resistance need to try and draw suspicion on themselves. It's a shame that it didn't come with the plot thickens cards from the original, but the roles are a lot better IMHO.

For fans of The Resistance, this version is mostly the same - two secret teams working against each other to be the first to complete (or sabotage) 3 missions.  Obviously it's all been rethemed here to quests, knights of Arthur, etc.

There are 2 main differences.  The first is that the plot cards from the original game have been removed, but there is info in the rules on how to add those to add to your experience here.  Secondly there are a number of new specific roles added, which can be included or not depending on what layer of complexity the group can handle, and if you want to try and bias things a bit toward good or evil.

Definitely fun, I'm really glad we got to try it, and I appreciate the extra attempt made to balance the scales of power.  I think it's questionable if you need to own both games, but I think any fun group needs one or the other.

Very simple rules, but incredibly deep learning curve. This game is all about logic, people reading, empathy, leadership, and of course bluffing!

There are so many different and unexpected situations that make Avalon so fun and create nearly endless replayability. This game is not really about the game, it's about the people you play with.
Me and my friends used to play Jaguar's Friend, Werewolves, and Mafia, which are all similar. We loved Avalon so much, that on our first day we played FIFTEEN games in a row.

It's also excellent to play with a lot of people. It can hold from 5 to 10 players, games are pretty quick (usually 20 to 40 minutes), and everyone plays from the beginning to the very end. And the best thing: most of the times you'll never completely understand what's going on until the very end!

Have played the original, but opted to buy this version as the theme appealed more, and the Merlin and special characters seemed like a fun idea.

I might lower my score one day a litte, as I really enjoy a midweigt to heavier game more, or feel more satisfied after. However this is a clever, well conceived design. And the scaling from 5 to 10 players lends it to varied situations. Multiple plays in an evening are easy. So that redeems it from light weight mediocrity!

RATING: 7.8
Very, very good game that IMO deserves it's status, but as with most party games it tends to become more and more stale the more you play it... most symptomatic of this is  having to surpress a sigh when seeing that you've drawn one of the generic good guys. That said, it's still pretty fun, but tends to get too much play in our group (in my opinion) - I've grown kind of tired of it, but I'd be surprised if I didn't still like it after a few months pause.

UPDATE:
After even longer than a year, I played it again. Was fun at first (the Merlin role makes the game) but grew stale rather quickly. I also think that it's poorly balanced with 5 players, (even if you include oberon) in favor of mordred's side - 1/3 chance AT WORST (realistically 1/2) to just win if you kill Merlin (if Mordred's side would've lost) is just too much, and for the good guys to win they need to know who their allies are without way too little information.

Will maybe update the rating as I think it will only shine with +7 players

Assassin : hij mag op het einde van het spel gokken wie Merlin is. Als zijn gok juist is, winnen de spionnen. (voordeel voor de spionnen)

Mordred: zijn identiteit blijft geheim voor Merlin. (voordeel voor de spionnen)

Oberon: hij weet niet wie de andere spionnen zijn en de andere spionnen weten ook niet dat hij een spion is. (voordeel voor the resistance)

Morgana: zij verschijnt in het begin van het spel als Merlin. Zo weet Percival niet wie van beide (Merlin of Morgana) de echte Merlin is. (voordeel voor de spionnen)

Players are members of Arthur's inner council, heading out on quests and fighting evil in the kingdom.  

This is a new version of the superb The Resistance.  The game play is essentially the same - a group of loyal followers has been secretly infiltrated by evil, who are attempting to topple the council from within.  All roles are hidden, so paranoia reigns here.  The first to complete/sabotage three quests wins the game.

This version has added in the characters of Merlin and the Assassin.  Merlin knows who the evil players are, but has to stay hidden as the evil players have a chance to win the game if they identify Merlin correctly (this is the Assassin's role).  Several other characters - Morgana, Percival, etc - can be added in to spice it up even more.  

If you are a fan of The Resistance, you'll want this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an "updated" version of The Resistance, with more roles which bring neat little twists to the game. So, this is a hidden role game, where every player gets assigned (randomly and secretly) either the role of a bad guy or a good guy. Once everyone has looked at their cards, everyone closes their eyes and, when called for, the evil guys open their eyes so they can see who they will be playing with. Once this is done, everyone closes and then opens their eyes at the same time. One player is then chosen as "team leader". He will select from 2-5 players to go on a mission, contingent on how many players are playing (up to 10!) and whether or not it is mission 1 to 5 (the amount of agents increases as the rounds proceed). There is a vote by each player to see if they agree with who will be sent out, and if the majority agrees, the team attempts the mission (or quest in Avalon). Each of the player selected for the mission receives two cards - Success or Failure. They then select one card and discard the other one *without showing anyone*. Once each member of the team has made their selection, the cards are shuffled (to hide who played what) and are revealed. Should they all be Success, the mission was successful. Should there be even one Failure, the mission went south and failed. The good guys are trying to get 3 Successful mission while the bad guys are trying to get 3 Failed mission. So far, so Resistance. Now here comes the wrinkles: instead of being generic good guys/bad guys, there are specific roles, such as Merlin, who gets to know who the bad guys are, but! if the bad guys successfully identify him at the end of the game, they win, even if they didn't get their 3 Failures. There is also Percival who gets to know who Merlin is. He should only be played with Morgana, who can pretend to be Merlin when Percival gets to find out. This can cause lots of laughter and confusion during the game as Merlin tries to hint at who the bad guys are without letting anyone know who he is since he might get killed at the end, thus losing! And Percival who sort of knows who Merlin is but not really! There's other roles too, but the only other one we played with was Lancelot... or rather the two Lancelot, one who is good and one who is bad. The thing is... they can change place. At the start of any mission, you flip a card. If it is blank, nothing changes, but should it show the two Lancelot, the good one becomes evil and the evil one becomes good. Lots of laughs, lots of fun, will be bringing it again. Fun fun fun.

RATING: 8.5
I got this game as a gift. I had been looking for a Werewolf style game that worked with fewer players, and it did not disappoint. I love this game because it's all about making crazy unfounded accusations, and then trying to convince people they make sense. Although it's frustrating to be the target of accusation, it's just fun to experience how group opinions are shaped and manipulated. This game works well for talkative, thick skinned groups. As the villians, you really have to believe that you are a good guy until the second you vote. This game has proven that I am a terrible liar.

We like to play where the mission leader describes what the mission is. This adds some more thematic flavor and give something else to argue about.

only good if you have lots of players.

Each player has a secret identity (good or evil + some specials). You try to complete missions so that one player tries to form party which goes on a mission. Good players play success and evil players may play success/failure.
One failure fails the quest. So good guys try to form out who are good and go out with only them. Evil try to decieve good ones.

One of my favourite games to pull out with 30 minutes to fill in a largish group.

It's essentially Resistance set in the time of Merlin and King Arthur rather than a futuristic rebellion and it is made by the same company (hence the name).  Mechanics are essentially the same, but what I love about Avalon is the ability to play other characters which meddles with the game and other players heads somewhat more than just teams yelling at each other.

A fantastic bluffing game and as I said, one of my absolute favourites!

RATING: 8
Probably the apex of the social deduction genre. Figuring out the combinatorial relations of who's voting where and who's passing what requires enough thought to make the deduction interesting.

That said, the game isn't really winnable using only that style of deduction; it requires predictions and extrapolations of other player's behavior and potential behavior. In fact, reading other's behaviors in this way is probably the most central part of the game. This is a skill, and it's one that it's possible to get better at.

The game's focus on reading does have downsides: the game shouldn't be played with uncaring players, and skill development is prone to confirmation bias. The first problem particularly rankles, as the game is simple in principle and can be introduced in lots of social settings, but is likely to go over poorly with some participants. A player who legitimately doesn't care brings the entire game down, and that's likely to occur in the social settings the game should slay in.

The confirmation bias isn't entirely a problem, though. Players' tendency to overestimate their own knowledge makes the final reveals all the more tense, and it's that final reveal that makes the game.

The included mix of roles and Lady of the Lake card do improve the game. Because of the game's tendency to groupthink, the roles' bias toward one side or another allow tweaking of the experience in a positive way (unlike many grab-bag expansions that just confuse players). As far as I can tell, all the special roles are worthwile, and well worth including in the box (if not your first game).

HIM!!! Why are you taking him on this mission!? TRAITOR! I love this game, unfortunately my game group is typically not large enough to take full advantage of this wonderful iteration of 'The Resistance'. Again, I enjoy the arthurian legend theme much more than the futuristic, utopian uprising theme of the original AND... it already comes with more roles than just the standards! If you haven't tried The Resistance and are interested in doing so I would HIGHLY recommend this version if the theme appeals to you more (exact same game).

I rate and consider both Resistance and the Avalon version as if they were one in the same - I always play Resistance with Merlin/Assassin (barring brand new groups) and I never play Avalon with anything more than Merlin/Assassin (I don't have any group who's interested in exploring these other routes.)

Resistance is a fine social-deduction game, and I'm sure you've heard of it if you're on this site. There's tension, betrayal and confusion - everything you need for a blast. While I'd still rank it above many of the social-deduction games that have come out since, the game has worn on me (I would have rating it an 8 or higher back in its heyday.)

I would always take a game of Deception over Resistance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I absolutely LOVE this game.  Second guessing of yourself, the intrigue, the deception... Love it!  The only knock on it is that in my experience, you can't really get a group of non-gamers to grasp any of the strategy.  It's working on a very deep Meta level.

It's just a retheme of the original, but the role cards do make it distinct enough. Wished they just made an expansion for the original instead. I can imagine how difficult it would be to play Merlin, but I can't give an opinion because I've only been vanilla for all three games. Will definitely play more just to test out group dynamics of other roles. There is the same disappointment you get in Werewolf where you get just vanilla. Maybe that's why I'm sticking with normal Resistance.

 This really is The Resistance with one extra role, ‘Merlin’, which is the one which knows who the ‘spies’ are but has to keep quiet about it.  If the Spies identify Merlin at the end of a ‘Resistance’ win then the ‘Resistance’ lose.  I much prefer the theme of the original: Spies and a Resistance seems more obvious than characters based around a mythic tale of which I have no knowledge nor care about.  But that notwithstanding, the additions to this game of Merlin and a few other optional characters, make this a better game and effectively makes Resistance redundant.  Shame they have to put it in an unnecessarily large box though.

This game repairs Resistance AND Mafia/Werewolf. It's one of the best party games I played. The roles make all the difference and makes me not to play vanilla Resistance ever again and no moderator and no player elimination puts it in front Werewolf, but only if there's 7 to 10 players. The game is not very good with 5 or 6. But otherwise it's an adrenaline fueled bluffing screaming blast!

Is this better than the resistance? Many in my gaming group think so, but im less sure. It has a lot more unique player powers and asyemetry, which i think it typically good in games. However, it can exhacibate the blame game even more. In my group the loosing side usually blame who ever they feel was responsible for the defeat, and i often feel this overshadows the whole experience. In this game, Merlin, and a couple of other characters are more exposed to this by the game design. Its not a bad game, but will depend on your group.

Pretty much the exact same as Resistance, but the addition of the role cards is high-impact, so much so that they rolled them back into the base game.  Of these, I think the most important addition is the Merlin/Assassin combo.  It makes you wonder why they weren't part of the base game to begin with as they add an extra layer of secrecy and mistrust to the table.  

Knowing that there is absolutely someone out there who knows everything at the table before the game starts (Merlin) is superbly balanced by the need to stay hidden from the one player who can ultimately clutch win it for the spies (Assassin).  For the players, play goes on as normal, but you're also trying to suss out who the Merlin is so you can vote with confidence; for the Merlin and Assassin, it's a nice little extra game of cat and mouse as the Merlin wants to tell everyone who the spies are, but cannot do so for the threat of the Assassin.  It's a beautiful edge to the game.

FYI: The Merlin starts the game knowing who the spies are.  The Assassin's job is to kill the Merlin; doing so wins the game for the spies, regardless of the outcome of the missions.  This can happen after the game has ended.

Oh Avalon, how I love/loathe thee.  I could write an essay on this one, and the psychology behind it.  This is a fantastic hidden identity game, and one with extremely high replay value, at least in certain circumstances. I've had more fun playing this game than just about any other--but it can be extremely, extremely frustrating, too. 

The key to a successful Avalon is having a large group of people (7+), and they must be repeat players--much of how this game is played depends on each individual group and the customs and signals the group develops.  This is a game of wits and a game of bluffing.

Two notes:  (1) Boardgamegeek's classification of Avalon as a "party game" is selling it very short.  There's a lot going on here.  (2)  As an aside, if you play this game with any frequency, you will get really good at looking people straight in the eye, and telling them the complete opposite of the truth.

I am helplessly addicted to this game. I love this game. Where Mafia would only be fun for a few popular people and bore everyone else (especially eliminated players), Resistance engages everyone from start to climatic finish. All my play groups talk about it after we've finished playing. Resistance: Avalon just creates memorable moments. It's also a great way to practice body language reading and persuasion skills.

The Resistance gains werewolf-esque roles. I thought the game was better for it mostly. I don't like the whole Merlin/Assassin aspect though because in my experience spies win more than the resistance and I feel this skews things even more towards the spies because of their guess at the end which can allow them to win. I like the theme and graphic design of this game more than the futuristic one. Sadly, this has already been supplanted with the two expansions that's been released for the futuristic version since it has all of the Avalon roles plus other new ways to play. I'm not sure if they'll expand Avalon or not, but at the time of writing this, it seems pointless unless you have to have the medieval theme.

I want to love this game. In the right group it could be great, but it often falls flat on its face. It's too easy to 'figure out' and ousting Merlin is way too easy at lower counts. I'd imagine the game improves toward the 9-10 player, but its hard to muster more than 6 players (and its pretty horrible at the 5-6 player count). If you can't consistently play with 8+ players, go with werewolf instead, or just play Secret Hitler regardless of how many friends you have.

[3 plays] The people who taught me this game didn't mention up front that it was a re-theme of the Resistance, and I sat there during the explanation thinking "wow, this seems JUST like the Resistance!" Not until I saw the BGG listing did it all make sense.

Anyway, this is just like the Resistance! But with an Arthurian theme, which is probably a slight improvement. And it's probably a fine game for what it is, but this was the game that finally made me realize that I just don't like this kind of game. 

I love deduction games, but not these "social deduction" games. They're probably more interesting the better the players know each other and the more they have played together, and since they are not popular in my circle, I didn't see them at their best by only playing occasionally. There's only as much to these games as the players bring to them, and without good player input, they're boring and random.

Social deduction game.  I like this even better than original Resistance, because the fiddly plot cards are replaced by the Merlin/Assassin roles, which is more elegant, and also gives Resistance members reason to be deceptive, and offers another thing to figure out. Love the Arthurian setting too.

Strictly speaking, I prefer One Night Ultimate Werewolf (if not WW itself), but I have a group that enjoys playing this as the evening ender, and for the most part I enjoy it. 

However, we play Avalon which is the version I prefer due to the added layer of the Merlin Call as the end of the game and the roles that play into that.

A party game that adds mechanics similar to Werewolf to the negotiation/deduction of Resistance. Theme-less gameplay that rests solely on the meta-gaming of one or two Alpha players that eventually makes the gameplay stale and unappealing. Negotiation games and co-op games in general need a higher level of theme and tangible intermediate goals to keep my interest.

They also depend on each player having a clearly defined turn where they act on their motivations and command center stage without being dominated by the meta-game of the game mechanics and the Alpha players.

My only negative comment on vanilla Resistance is that I miss the roles/powers of Werewolf and then BAM, they come out with Resistance: Avalon.  Takes some familiarity with the game to be able to play successfully as Merlin (or one of Arthur's knights too, actually), but I would never play vanilla over this unless the majority wanted to for some reason.  Assassination of Merlin gives awful spies like me a shot at redemption :)

The Resistance (and by extension, Avalon) was largely supplanted for me by Secret Hitler.  The latter game has more ability to play the probabilities to try to figure out who is a bad guy, rather than Avalon, which largely seemed to devolve into an analysis of who deviates from the accepted meta game.

I found Avalon to regularly go too long, and had far too many games where the discussion was more about whether you are "playing the game right" rather than about actually playing the game.  I get why some groups can get obsessively deep with Avalon, but it's one of the worst games I can imagine playing that many times.  It's the sort of thing that would just suck the fun right out of a game for me.

Our group just love deduction game, but quite frankly I just cannot wrap my head around this. Everyone is trying to be good guy and there is some threads of information from the voting that I just simply cannot comprehend. Even after so many plays sometimes I just had no idea what was going on! This is one of those trash talk loud mouth games, I suppose people with good acting skill will be vastly fitting for this type of game. I like certain character powers certain side and you kinda need to balance it out for both and with different customization the gameplay varies. I like it better than original werewolf as it plays much quicker.

Pros
-Social game based on deduction, logic and reading others

Cons
-Relies heavily on group; not for everybody (lots of arguing, betrayal etc)
-Harder to explain than Resistance because of character powers and all hidden information
-Bad luck can ruin a game (e.g. good guys finding their perfect combination on their first try)
-Consequently, can feel very luck based (especially an issue if not many powers are used)
-Minimum group size is restrictive (NEEDS 5+)

I have never played the original Resistance or really any "werewolf" style game besides this one, for that matter. I really like the acting and subterfuge in this game. Somehow it is very different from the sort of lying and chicanery that you see in Diplomacy. This game will reveal more tactics as time goes by, I'm sure.

I almost hesitate to rate the game at this point because so far after six games I still have never been one of the bad guys. This means I'm losing out on a lot of what makes the game tough and interesting. Even so, I really like it and it seems like a natural for expansions.

I have not played resistance for comparison. However, Avalon is fun. Avalon has nice looking pieces. Avalon is Very quick. It scratches the same itch as battlestar but can be played in 20-30 mins. It plays up to 10 which is a bonus. 

The rulebook is garbage and the spelling  is painful (coming from me that's scary)! For instance "Unkown" is printed on most of the cards. If this game gets reprinted and the rule book gets a complete overhaul I would rate it at 8.5. 

The game may have balance issues with the merlin card but I will reserve judgment on that until I get a few more plays in. I also had an issue with some of the cards sticking together when I unwrapped them (which cause a small amount of damages to the cards). 

Edit. Disadvantage is that it is only fun with right group in the right mood, this is more prominent than most other games.

Traitors attempt to get the quests to fail in this quick game.   Speed really works well here as the mechanics are relatively simple and the game is all in the interactions of the players.  Merlin knows who the traitors are, but if they figure out who he is,the traitors will still win, so Merlin needs to be sly in his advice giving.

I really enjoy the game. It plays super fast, a round takes maybe 15 minutes on average, but we can play this for hours. And the characters are awesome! It is a very tough game for the good guys, but it's much better so than if it were vice versa. Word of caution: This is a hidden agenda game and is therefore very confrontative and is more enjoyable with a talkative group.

In comparison to other iterations of games of this genre, it is not that different IMO. For me the best thing is that it takes a short time. However, the one thing I don't like at all is the generic fantasy theme. That can be a serious turn off for people who are not that keen on these stuff, myself included. As a game intended to be enjoyed by non-gamers as well, I think that a more inviting art/theme would have been better.

Not my game.  I find the main voting mechanic repetitive and the game dull as dirt.  That's especially true if you don't get a named character and/or you aren't often selected to go out on missions.  I'm not into party games in general, although I enjoy Dixit, Cards Against Humanity, Shadow Hunters, Bang!, Infected, and Salem 1692, but this is one of the lowest on my list.  I'd be fine with the voting mechanic if it serviced something else that actually featured gameplay, and not just a second pass/fail vote.  But voting to service more voting, all to service an identity enquiry just doesn't do anything for me.  Add to that the lying component, which I don't have a moral problem with, but which I actively dislike doing, just means that this game fails for me on all levels.  I'm in a gaming group that loves this game, and I'll play it with them if I'm in the mood and because I like the people in the group, but I'd never buy it, never suggest it myself, and just as often I'll diverge from the main group and go play something else just to get away from this game.

Pros:
- one of the most structured secret identity and deduction games, making it more strategic than many.
- the role of Merlin, who alone knows the identity of the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles as if his true identity is discovered, all will be lost. There are other special roles that seem exciting but I haven't had a chance to play with those yet.
- loads of fun

Cons:
- no dedicated app meaning somebody needs to play the leader and read a script.
- it doesn't have the silliness of games like One night - Ultimate Werewolf
- plays in 30mins - not as pacy as games like One night - Ultimate Werewolf which plays in 10mins or so

RATING: 1
Although I didn't have as miserable an experience playing this as I did Nightfall, The Resistance is still one of the least enjoyable experiences I've ever had playing a board game. My bad experiences include (but are not limited to): Not going on any missions for an entire game because I was a traitor in the last game (I had literally no interaction in the game whatsoever) and another where "I don't even know this guy, so I'm going to vote against everything he does". There are no meaningful decisions, the game revolves around people yelling at each other and lying about whether or not they can be trusted - I'm neither loud nor a good liar/bluffer, so this game holds absolutely no appeal for me.

I will never play this again, however I do understand why some people like it. I rate it this low because I don't really consider it an actual game, just an activity (and one that can be horribly broken by people who know each other and can tell when each other are lying).

[b][i]The Resistance: Avalon[/i][/b] is a fun quick lie-to-your friends social deduction game. Everyone goes through the game claiming to be a good guy while a few are actually bad guys lying through their teeth. People vote on a subset of the group to send on a mission and, if sent, bad people will sometimes cause the mission to fail while claiming that they would never have failed that mission. Games sometimes come down to shouting matches, but in a good way. It's the only game where I feel comfortable sitting down with 9 complete strangers and telling one of them (while smiling to remind that it is, after all, only a game) that I think they're a dastardly no-good liar, an evil Minion of Mordred bent on sowing the destruction of all that is good and virtuous. They of course accuse me in kind (probably correctly) and by the end you've hopefully made some new friends.

Because comparisons to Mafia/Werewolf (another lie-to-your friends social game) are nearly inevitable, I'll add that I think The Resistance is superior in every possible way.

[b]Avalon vs Standard:[/b] I think The Resistance: Avalon is better than The Resistance. They both have the same core rules, but Avalon has alternate identities instead of once-a-turn action cards. The one thing I prefer in The Resistance is the dystopian future theme. Still, you cannot go wrong with either.

The resistance is in my top 3 games, and this version is superior in my mind. As another commenter said, adding Merlin gives both the spies AND the good guys a reason to lie and act their butts off. It's a fantastic experience, and the new components are excellent.

Update - Better than base Resistance, but I rarely play this anymore. One Night Ultimate Werewolf is easier to explain and play, and if I have more time I'll play something like Dark Moon.

Adds roles to the resistance game and throws a wrench in the game with the Merlin/Assassin characters. It adds another element to the game and keeps it fun.

Much better than the original. Remove plot cards all together. No need for them anymore.

This is the best party game I own when it hits the table.  Certainly have seen people hold grudges from it, but man, it's just a great version of bluffing/hidden info.

Things I particularly like:
Every person is important.  You don't have a have the merlin card to be relevant in a game.
The design of needing to know the exact right good team by the end of the game.
Components feel nice.  I sleeved the cards, as I think they were so-so, and I didn't want them showing marks, but the rest of the components are great, feel nice and slick.

Although it's functionally identical to The Resistance, I prefer to play this one.  Though the "plot cards" in Resistance can make things interesting, I find that the special roles in Avalon are better.

A really brilliant game when played in large numbers.  The arguments around the table about who to send on a quest are heated and often hilarious.  With smaller groups it loses some of its fun and becomes a bit more serious, as you can start to logically work out who might be the traitor.  In large groups that's almost impossible to do at times and it turns a bit more into a game of poker, trying to read your opponents and pick out any bluffers amongst them.

Szilveszter alkalmával sikerült kipróbálni ezt a partijátékot, pedig már korábban is megkaptam Jani barátunktól PnP változatban, II. világháborús kémes design-al ajándékba.
Nagyon tetszett, nem hiába szerepel vezető helyen a vonatkozó listában.
Nagy előnye számomra a "gyilkolós/vérfarkasos" játéknál, hogy játékideje jóval kevesebb, így több játékra lesz alkalmunk, több lehet a sikerélmény. Ajánlom betenni a nevesített mellékkaraktereket is. Profik részére az akciólapok tovább színesítik a játékot.
A játék egyetlen gyenge pontja maga a játékos társaság. Csak olyanokkal ülj le egy asztalhoz, akik tényleg szeretnék kideríteni, hogy kik a kémek, van kedvük a játék közben figyelni a többiek reakcióit, döntéseit, maguk is aktívan részt vesznek benne. Ezért is partijáték! :)
Összességében remek szórakozás!

The Arthurian theme lends itself well to the game, but seems to scare away casual players.  I think the regular version of The Resistance may be a little more palatable to non-gamers, mostly just from the stigma of Dungeons and Dragons.

Once you convince them to play, though, I've found most people get into the game and enjoy it.

Yera

Es un juego de roles. En esta version, con ambientacion "arturica" que le calza bastante bien (tendria que probar el original para comparar). no es excesivamente complejo. se entiende bien a la primera partida, muy rejugable y bien estructurado. 

el comienzo de la partida (cuando siguiendo las normas unos miran y otros no, etc, para conocer lealtades) es lo mejor del juego :D

el defectillo que tiene es que requiere 5 jugadores minimo, por lo cual dependiendo del grupo es mas dificil que vea mesa. 

en su tipo es de lo mejorcito. no es tan divertido en el manejo de los roles como otros, pero conjuga muy bien todo.

RATING: 8.5
On the one hand, the theming is kinda weird (with all due apologies to Messrs. Laget and Cathala, the Arthurian legends are not characterized by betrayal from within apart from Lancelot)--but the roles change things in potentially interesting ways. I'm not 100% sold on Merlin et al, but the roles beat the pants off the execrable Plot cards from the base version. So... kinda the definitive version?

RATING: 9
Logic & reasoning.  Backstabbing and Betrayal.  Those are the best descriptors of this game and you should be prepared to despise your friends for lying to you at the end of it.  

Based in Arthurian legend, Avalon requires the Knights of the Round Table (5-10) to go on quests for Arthur in order to defeat the forces of Mordred and Morgana.  However, the Knights have been infiltrated and some are secretly working to Mordred's cause.

Minimal number of gameplay pieces so it's quite portable and the only thing you need to bring with you is a brain and an ability to lie.  The different characters are optional but keep the game fresh with the different number of combinations that can be played.  Card protectors are advisable.

Best not to play with lots of alcohol as people can become quite arsey.

Played once with a group of 5, it was fun, but it was even funnier when people made silly mistakes for not being familiar with the rules! Definitely need some practice to get experienced with it, but once one figures out, it might not be as fun. Also, there was a Spanish/Portugese? game we played after loads of drinks about a village, a murderer, a sex worker and a witch, which I think similar but even better, and that one you don't need to pay any money to get the kit, just a few poker cards will do.

I love the game, but our group maxes out at 5 for the most part and the new elements of Avalon are wasted in shorter player counts. Even the base Resistance loses lusture without more people i feel. Neither this ( which can be played without Merlin and Co) or the original come to the table as much as i would like. Same rating for original Resistance. IMO if you are buying a copy today, Avalon is the way to go. More in the box and you can play without the speciality Merlin and Co cards and get to the base game.

RATING: 4
While Avalon is very good for what it is (a Werewolf/Resistance/Mafia/Bang! type game where you are given a secret identity and two teams try to influence each other without revealing themselves) I dislike all of these games and Avalon is no exception. Every one of these games relys on deception and accusation (all within the scope of the game), and I am very uncomfortable with lying and accusing so I don't enjoy it. These are also behaviors that I would rather not encourage in my child who is frequently at my game nights, so that's another factor. A friend commented recently that "Avalon is a game where you feel dirty if you win, and dirty if you lose" and I agree. 

All that aside, if you do enjoy this type of game, Avalon is certainly one of the best versions out there. Players don't die or get eliminated until the end of the game so everyone remains involved, and there are optional special characters that you can play with to add some interesting twists. (Percival knows who Merlin is, and the Lady of the Lake can learn the good or evil nature of one other player after select rounds). Evil also gets a last ditch effort to win (if they haven't already) by trying to assasinate Merlin at the end of the game.

It is also a good game for a large player count (6-10 players) which can be hard to find, so that is something to consider, but I greatly prefer Codenames if I need a game for a large number of players.

Resistance (and Avalon) are easily my favorite large group game.

Any game where I have to play people rather than the game itself is going to be a boring time.  I simply am not interested in this type of experience.  Our 6-player games consisted of people yelling a lot and trying to be loud and coercive.  I just don't see a lot of fun here, and the game itself is very shallow.  I may as well be playing any other party game, at least it would involve less confrontation and more actual gameplay.

It's tricky to learn, (especially if you've been drinking wine. haha) but by the third game I was totally into it. It's good vs evil, but when about half the players are lying, it's kind of every man for himself. Every round I've played is intense in it's own way. And the moment of victory at the end is so sweet, if you were lucky enough to chose the right allies, or if you were deceitful enough to be trusted.

Avalon is really fun for the first 20 or 30 plays, with lots of laughter and wild accusations and crazy reveals.

Great fun and quick game that quickly gets fingers pointed at others trying to deduce traitors in your midst. Played with 5-9 players and it was great. 

The game hasn't hit the table so much that it has fallen from graces a bit as well. Social interaction games have a tendency to do that. Hopefully Deception can fill the void

Updating rating "6": Have over 30 plays on this and nowadays I won't even consider it during a party unless, it's strictly new players. Deception Murder in Hong Kong has pretty much replaced this game

OK, so it's just Werewolf, but at least you can play it sitting down. We couldn't work out whether the 'good guys' could send the same people on quests again and again once one quest had succeeded, much in the game seems to depend on how soon the bad guys come up in the turn order. A tough game to rate, it's hardly original, but plenty of fun with the right group.

Having played both this and the original Resistance, I much prefer this version, which is the one I ended up purchasing even if I prefered the other's theme. The additional cards in The Resistance never felt like they added more to the gameplay and intrigue, instead simply watering down the strategy. But the additional roles in Avalon do the opposite: they ratchet up the tension, and add in some refreshingly disparate roles to the game. Love it, though it certainly needs the right group of players to click with.

I have resistance + hidden agenda which i will say is equivalent to Avalon as others also agree. This game was something that got me into board games, but as years pass I find it to get more and more stale. I won't ever turn down a game but I won't suggest it. It has a special place in my heart and  a special place on my board game shelf: all the way in the back.

RATING: 5
Played once with only Merlin and Assassin cards.  To me the additions don't fix the fundamental problems I have with Resistance - there's too little information to go on for the good team.  Unless everyone is completely invested in the game (which would slow it to a crawl) it devolves into a bunch of random votes for random missions that will inevitably result in the spies winning.  I can't complain too much though since it's usually over very quickly.

There's still a skill-disparity problem where inexperienced players will make suboptimal moves, giving away important information to veterans.

It is basically The Resistance to the next level. Not only are spys (now Minions of Mordred) being deceptive about what side they are on, now there are players being deceptive about what character they are. And members of the Knights of Camelot (Resistance) are trying to deceive the Minions of Mordred, as well as the other way round.
If it is too much, you can use this version to play a King Arthur themed version of Resistance by just ignoring the specific characters.

A terrific larger group game that is always entertaining. I enjoy both being a spy and trying my hardest to mislead and cast doubt as well as being on the good side trying to ferret out the evil doers.

It is group dependent, however. People need to engage and really get into it. If everyone is going all out, you will rarely have more fun.

The obvious comparison here is to Resistance, as the only difference here is the existence of specific roles. But I think in total I'm not a huge fan of the roles. I think they're interesting on paper but in practice they just bog down an already strong game. One weird situation is when a non-merlin figures everything out; in the original they still have to convince everyone else whereas here they have someone who can easily just get on their side and know they're right but this then makes the assassin's job basically impossible. Though the opposite could happen as well; a non-merlin could have some theory that ends up being incorrect and they could push it hard, and then that puts merlin in an awkward position and even if the revolutionaries do pull it out, it makes the assassin's life much easier. And it seems like these kinds of situations should come up because the way the merlin/assassin dynamic works, the non-merlins are encouraged to make it look like they know more than they do to throw off the assassin. And ultimately I think all of this gets in the way of what was already a strong social deduction game experience. It's still mostly the same core experience so I do still like it, but I'd prefer to not play with the roles in general.

I think this is the fastest a game has gone to being a family favorite: EVERYONE loves it. Strong "one more game" effect. 

One thing (not game's fault): holy crap does the kids "strategy" throw me for a loop... I'd really like to play several sessions of this with adults, but the chaos of the double/triple/quadruple think of playing with the kids is still fun.

Avalon attempts to make the formula from The Resistance more interesting with defined roles. It would be a success on that front if the new roles didn't give the enemy team a chance (an especially high one at that in smaller games) of winning by blind guess.

But that's not the core issue for me; the issue is that it is still The Resistance with all its positives and negatives. I get its popularity, but it is just not a bluffing game I enjoy.

This is a great game.  It has a lot of tension.  When Merlin is in the game, then it is almost like 2 games in one: winning the quests and finding Merlin.  This game is very interesting even as a standard good guy, because the good guys need to find and protect Merlin.  Also, I like this better than One Night Ultimate Werewolf because ONUW games can be ruined in certain cases (troublemaker switches away a werewolf.)

It's the Resistance, only different.  I'm not a big fan of all the special roles in Ultimate Werewolf, so I have mixed feelings about the special roles in Avalon.  On the other hand, the theme is a little more appealing and the game just seems to flow a little better somehow.  I'd say overall I like it marginally better than the Resistance.  Update: Just as the Seer is necessary in Werewolf, I've come to view Merlin/Percival/Assassin as necessary in Avalon.  Update: Evidence suggests that I'm willing to join a game when somebody brings this out, much more so than The Resistance.

RATING: 7.5
Very curious how the whole Merlin/assassin thing will work out: Certainly playing Merlin well must be a challenge; give the hints without giving yourself away. Perhaps this will force the rest of the good guys to act in a more "Merlin-like" manner and vice versa? And will the baddies have to follow suit, so as not to stick out among all the Merlin wannabees? :)

In my club we have tried playing with a slightly - or so I think - nerfed version of the Assassin, where assassination attempts on Merlin have to be made before the final team is approved (if at all). Works well, but I am not sure how much it actually changes anything...

Currently, Resistance and Resistance: Avalon are the gold standard of hidden role games. The rules can be explained easily during play, the voting and mission system keeps things moving along and keeps people involved while providing enough information about what people want to allow an actual basis for accusations of being a traitor. Can get too chaotic with more than 7 players, or at least I tend to lose track of who does what above 7.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (November 2012)

The Resistance Avalon is a better game than the base one. Meaning is it a GREAT negotiation/party game. It adds a lot of complexity with the new characters making it more of a Gamer´s game version of the Resistance. It still has the same core rules, but now you have role powers making it a more compelling experience. Now, both teams have new ways to play with Merlin and the Assassin. The cards and components are gorgeous and in line with the new edition of The Resistance.

With this edition, you can also play the original Resistance, so there is not a reason to buy The Resistance over Avalon. Perhaps, the only caveat to this, is that you can mix the games, I have not read the rules yet so I’m not sure how this will work.

The playtime continue to be short, however with the added complexity comes the main weakness of Avalon. As there are more rules, it is easier to make a mistake that will break the game. In our game, we made 2 mistakes with the new rules and two of us were experienced gamers :S. If you have new players in your hands, I would recommend you to play the original Resistance game before you introduce the role powers.

I dig the fantasy theme, but I prefer the dystopian future of the original Resistance. 

Bottom line, the best iteration of the Resistance series of games. More complex than the original, but more fun too. And you can play the original Resistance with Avalon. A must buy for me (or it would have if I didn’t own already The Resistance, perhaps I will buy it anyway :D)

The art of the game is gorgeous, and the components seem very nice UNTIL you play with them. They are very low quality and peel off after the FIRST PLAY. I need to sleeve my cards ASAP as well as the vote counters. 

Still a great game, but I wish the components were like the Resistance 1st Edition.

Incredible game. In my opinion the theme is slighter more fun and engaging than the Resistance and adding the additional characters with unique abilities takes this game up a notch. Overall this is one of the most fun games I've ever played. This was a huge hit with my play group and we could not stop playing! Adding in Merlin (knows who is evil but cannot be too obvious in giving clues to the group because he can be assassinated) and Percival (knows who Merlin is) really changes the dynamics of the game for the better and lessens some of the chance elements inherent in pure resistance. We also had some fun adding in Mordred(stays hidden from Merlin)and Morgana (reveals herself to Percival as Merlin) although we found Morgana very challenging to play effectively.

The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered, all will be lost.

The more I play the Resistance, the more I think that the Avalon version might be the inferior design. I'm all for the hidden roles and their abilities (it makes it seem a little more like Werewolf, which I much prefer), but I think the plot cards are a little more clever, and these roles feel a little bit like spoon feeding the strategy (which doesn't always work very well).

I'm giving this game a positive rating, but it really requires everyone playing to play it "properly" for it to work. If you have a group of players who have never played this kind of game before, the advantage swings heavily to evil. Players simply aren't suspicious enough. I have yet to play this around a table of strong players, but I imagine it will be great when that happens.

In this kind of games the fun is strongly dependent to the players you're playing with, developing a sort of meta-game built on top of the few, simple rules. My vote is given to these few rules, to the components and to the meta game they inspire. I don't think it's high replayable with the same gang over and over. My vote is absolute among all board games, but if you particularly like its genre it's a must buy.

While the theme isn't nearly as cool as in the original Resistance, the roles add a lot of complexity to the game without taking away from the social side of things. A significant step up from the gamey plot cards.

 We got a lot of play out of Avalon, but now I am played out.  One thing that grew old is the strategies get sandy.  Take two people on a mission, then the same 2 plus one.

Improves Resistance, itself an improvement on Werewolf making it a true game, further by introducing roles, enhancing gameplay by giving more clues to act on. Still, the game depends on the right group and needs communicative players able to bluff. As soon as two or three players remain quiet, the game degenerates and whoever talks will be accused of being a spy. The way to win then is the most boring one breaking the game: do not talk and hope for the best for your faction.

As far as bluffing and deduction games go, there's a reason this one is mentioned so often.  It's a lot of fun, but not my personal favorite.  I feel like more could be done with the Arthurian theme (especially with the app, One Night Ultimate Werewolf's moderator app blows this app completely out of the water).  We usually make up scenarios for the quests to add a little flavor to it.

The default inclusion of the Assassin, while fun gives the Evil team a much easier time in this one, which makes playing the Good team more stressful than it should be.  Granted, there has to be checks and balances for Merlin (much like being lynched if you out yourself as The Seer in UW), but playing with a bad Merlin can make for a pretty frustrating game.

The Resistance really is the greatest negotiation game currently in existence and the new version has pushed me to finally upgrade both the base game and the new version up to a 10.

I don't care at all about the theme, which to me seems superfluous and hackneyed. I didn't care about the Star Wars-ish theme either, but I think the idea that a King Arthur theme makes the game more approachable to the general public is also silly. It also is very surprising that they would let the game go to print with the typos on the cards. I don't really care, since they don't affect the game play at all (no one has even noticed them), but I do think it is unfortunate.

I also disapprove of the Kickstarter model, which encourages companies to hold back parts of what must have been originally part of the game to reward backers. There's no reason why Lancelot shouldn't be part of the game that everyone purchases except greed. That said, I have no principles in this matter because I still backed the project because of my love for the game.

I have enjoyed Resistance at all player counts. It is relatively easy to teach and with seasoned players, it is one of the most intense game experiences you can get. The amount of deceit flying around the table is really tons of fun. One of the hallmarks of a great game experience is how much it is discussed once it's over. I've seen conversations go on for quite some time about what had just happened, which goes to show how rewarding the game is.

Avalon makes it hard to enjoy other hidden identity games.  I would like Secret Hitler if it wasn't for Avalon.  I can't play the Resistance anymore.  Avalon just does everything so well.  There is an elegance to it that the other games lack.  Currently, the only other hidden identity game that I will choose to play over Avalaon is Rick and Morty: Total Rickall, but that's only because I'm a fan of that show.

I love this game, but having played it several times a month for over a year, I have to take a break.  The key is moderation.  There are other games that I really want to play that I miss out on when I play too much Avalon.

Ultimately I think the original Resistance is better. The components for this one are top notch. Really good. But the biggest rules change (the Merlin mechanic) just doesn't seem to work. Merlin is too hamstrung by the Assassin to be much use. This game introduces a bunch of new rules for very little return.

My group's favourite game, bar none.  We have probably played this over 50 times now.  I'm not as fanatical over having to play this every game night as some of my friends, but it is still one that I highly regard.

Certainly not my type of game, however, it is well illustrated, quite quick and interesting. I usually cannot hide my real intentions, especially from my wife. And in this game bluffing is quite important. I haven't noticed imbalance between the teams, which is a common bug of such games. At least in a 5 player game both teams have similar chances to win. This is ensured by an ability to kill Merlin.

Tikrai ne mano tipo žaidimas, tačiau gražiai nupieštas, pakankamai greitas ir įtraukiantis. Aš dažniausiai nemoku slėpti savo ketinimų ypač nuo žmonos, o čia blefavimas gana svarbus. Dažnas tokių žaidimų trūkumo - nesubalansuotos komandos - šiame žaidime taip pat neradau. Bent jau 5 žaidėjų žaidime komandų šansai lygūs. Tai užtikrina Merlino nužudymo galimybė.

This has become a classic social deduction game.  We've found it really hard for the "good guys" to win.  The game has a tendency to devolve into rampant accusations of lying and lots of finger-pointing.  We've had fun though.

Great social game. More logic based than Secret Hitler, and therefore, I find room for both games. It's unfortunate that the Kickstarter promo is widely unavailable..


4 players:
1 minion (assassin)
3 loyals (2 normal and Merlin)

4 rounds:
Round 1: 2 players
Round 2: 3 players
Round 3: 3 players
Round 4: 3 players

Loyals needed 3 successes to win, minions only needed two.

No need to have this and the Resistance, since playing without Merlin and the Assassin takes you to exactly the game of Resistance.

Merlin and the Assassin add an enjoyable piquance to the game. The other characters are also interesting.

Wow.   It's all about what people bring to table.  There is not one person we have introduced this to who hasn't said lets play it again.  Even with five is not bad.   I love it from 8-10.  

Sleeve this game immediately.  I know who Percival and Merlin are now because of excited people revealing the cards too passionately at end of game.   Lol.  The sleeves help that.   Watch a play through of this game.   Play over supper.  Play 6 games in a row.   The mechanics don't make this game.   The group does!

RATING: 9.5
If you don't own the resistance, and you should, you might as well grab this version.  The added character roles are not necessary but do add a bit of variety if your group has played a lot of resistance.

I'm not sure I like the version with the roles better than regular resistance but you can play either version with this set.

Unless the futuristic theme of the original Resistance is extremely important to you, this is the version that everyone should own. It has all the features of the original, plus added interesting twists which can help keep the game from feeling stale after repeated plays. This game is highly dependent on your group's desire to play a deception game, especially one that lasts multiple rounds.

RATING: 8
[PNP] One of my first social deduction games and I still occasionally play it. Secret Hitler kinda replaced it but I'll talk about the strengths of this one. First of all picking a team of 3-4 players is crazy tense, everyone is looking at you and lying shamelessly or they are telling the truth and you have no idea. When you get betrayed and get blamed you just feel the pressure to defend yourself and find the evil person that just flunked the mission. The special abilities also add some flavour to the game. I still like this one and want to play it when we are 7 players since it is the sweetest number for it. Maybe get Secret Hitler over this if you don't own any of them even though this is cheaper.

RATING: 9.5
I enjoyed vanilla Resistance and this is basically the same game with some more rules and character abilities.  I like how it has a lot of ways to customize the game.  Therefore if I was only rating it against vanilla Resistance, this would be higher because of the "more" factor.  My copy has the fixed cards with the spelling mistakes corrected.  I do prefer the sci-fi Resistance theme, though, so when the Hostile Intent and Hidden Agenda expansions for that game game out, it gave it the Avalon extra roles and a ton of other options, so it then somewhat fired Avalon for me.  I will always still play Avalon, as it is a near perfect game to me, but now that regular Resistance has been upgraded with great expansion material, I'm there.

This is a near-perfect game. The additions Avalon brings to the table (new theme--I vastly prefer Arthur to Anonymous Luke Skywalker--new roles, etc) make this just a bit better than its predecessor...which seems an almost impossible feat.

Azért nagyon társaságfüggő, és minimum 6-7 főről beszélünk, ráadásul egyértelműen inkább felnőttekkel kell játszani (mondjuk 16+). Kellemes meglepetés, az biztos.

As a big ONUW fan, I was excited to try another popular deduction game. Our one game was with only the Merlin and Assassin cards. We didn't quite get the strategy, the Minions of Mordred easily won, and it just seemed like there was a lot less information to process than ONUW. We'll try again with more special roles next time...that is if I can get anyone to play another time.

I used to really enjoy this game. We would play it almost every night in the dorms, and it is part of what made us closer. It was very tense and exciting. 
That is why I am giving it a high score, because it really used to  be addictive, and we got a lot of sessions out of it.
But now I am completely burned out on it. I tried playing again a while ago, and it just went on and on. Now it just seems exhausting to me. Still, it lasted long enough to deserve a high score.

Resistance with some new roles. The Merlin/Assassin element adds a whole new twist on this game. Overall I enjoy it as much as resistance, and don't think the game is as polarizing as others have said.

Supposedly a more balanced version of Werewolf/Mafia that doesn't need a moderator and doesn't have player elimination. Thing is, it's balanced to an extreme. I enjoyed my first couple games, but repeated plays have proven to be less and less fun. Once you are familiar the game, it basically plays itself, not to mention some mechanisms are easily exploitable.

To put things into perspective, I have more fun getting eliminated in the first round of Werewolf, and then spending the next half hour quietly observing the group dynamics, than playing Avalon from start to finish. Maybe Werewolf is unbalanced, but the actual experience is fun. The one Avalon crafts isn't.

Buy this one instead of the original Resistance game because this has more replayability with the special characters.  The game has a learning curve and it definitely takes a few games for players to learn how to prevent themselves from being figured out.

It's loads of fun with plenty of excitement for everybody.  Great party game and an intriguing game for friends that don't normally play games.

Update:  dropped from 9 to 8 because you have to play it a few times with the same group and everybody has to be interested.  One disinterested player will ruin it for everyone.

The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered, all will be lost.

Better then Werewolf as it is for less people and more of a sit down (controlled game). Also better then The Resistance for me due to the diffident characters.

If you don't like arguing or making a case for yourself then this is not the game for you. A little flavor text for missions could have helped thematically but it's still so much fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's like werewolves, but with a little more thinking involved, because you can actually use the process of elimination to try and narrow the evil guys down (whereas in werewolves, it's a lot more plain guessing).
It's a little less casual than werewolves, but Resistance: Avalon is still a really good game that's suitable for group events.

RATING: 7
A game about deception and deduction. Two teams race for best-out-of-5. "Good" players must try to learn the identities of others, while the "bad" players knows the identities and are trying to confuse the "good" players. The game requires a LOT of table tall, information sharing, and each player should feel comfortable about lying. Very mind-tiring game and requires everyone to be at the same level, else it would be a frustrating game. 7+ players recommended.
The base game is identical to The Resistance, however the special character powers adds to the replay value, as well as level of deduction. Could argue it is strictly better than The Resistance.

Just beautiful, the perfect game for an evening with friends, very sofa friendly. Non-gamers love it and it's a huge improvement over Werewolf, IMO. The pieces in this Avalon version are nice, the art is good and the added roles are fun, but honestly, it doesn't need much to work. One of my favorites!

RATING: 10
This is a significantly, much better enhancement/ implementation of The Resistance, with an extra layer of social strategy using special role cards (like Werewolf).  Avalon has more social intrigue than Werewolf does and does NOT require a non-player moderator!  It also adds the flavorful theme of Camelot.  It probably could've been called "The Mists of Avalon" b/c that's how it feels when you start out each game - most players are in a fog as to who is really whom.

In my first playing of it, it quickly became very addictive and the majority of our group proceeded to play over 7 times in under five hours!  This rocks if you really enjoy social deduction & hidden/secret roles in games like Werewolf, Battlestar Galactica, Shadows Over Camelot, Shadow Hunters, Bang!, etc.  (I daresay Resistance Avalon is probably way better than Werewolf within the 5 to 10 players range since it's the same feel, more social deduction opportunities and in a shorter game time plus there are no player eliminations.)

RATING: 7.5
Great party game that is a great replacement for Mafia! My biggest complaint with Mafia is that if you die early you can't enjoy the rest of the round. Nobody dies in Avalon which makes it fun for everyone! I am not good at lying so I like to always be good but it is much harder to win being good in my opinion. Very easy to teach but surprisingly hard to master. Remember that approving and rejecting missions is a big part of the strategy in the game.

But they pick it up once we get going.  I could play this every week.

I like this game. There are no additional features like in Bang or BattleStar Galactica, just pure deduction with clever rules, and if the games became samey, you can spice things up with the additional roles.
The only thing I found lacklustre is that the quests doesn't have any special rules besides the number of players to select. I think I'll write a variant based on Carpenter's "The Thing" with role-infection rules, and objectives for the quests.

The best at what it is, a bluffing social deduction game.

Easy to learn, difficult to master, the ever-evolving game states change with whoever you play and roles they get along with their reactions.

Lots of variants combination to tune the balancing for each geoups
ie. Mordred in to help the bad guys, Oberon in to help the good guys etc.

Require the group to speak up their opinion.
Require Merlin to not break the game. The newbies would find it difficult at first but they can learn it the hard way, just reset the game if that giveaway is too strong.

Great time without ever dragging too long.
Can be good for people to get to know each others.

Highly recommended.

Merlin/the assassin adds an interesting twist to this game, and it does take some finesse as Merlin to give enough hints while not being conspicuous. However, winning as the evil team by correctly guessing Merlin is anticlimactic. Also, this applies to the original game too but the secrecy and bluffing is really not for me: while it does create a lot of tension in this game every game I've played I've also been really stressed out at the end, and any game where I'm just barely having fun regardless of how clever the mechanics doesn't deserve that high of a rating from me.

My first social deduction game, Resistance will always have a place in my heart, even if it never has a spot on the table. There's almost always a different game that I'd rather play for one reason or another, but I'm still down for a PBF or Mumble game from time to time. I think that voting history makes Resistance a much better game, and that's really hard in person, particularly since most people just don't care until at least 1-2 missions in, at which point the game is half over.

The Resistance with some very interesting role cards that shake things up. The main addition being Merlin who knows who the spies are but cannot reveal himself because if, after the good guys win a match, the bad guys can guess who Merlin was, the bad guys would still win.
I much prefer this over original Resistance, but I haven't played with more than 5 people and not with some of the different role cards for each side.

Bought 2013 UK Game Expo. I think we prefer this because of the Merlin mechanism. A good last ditch attempt for the spies to win! I do wish this game worked with non-gamers though, we don't feel comfortable trying it with our non-gamer friends.

Earlier we enjoyed werewolf playrounds sometimes and always thought that it had to be played in smaller rounds at the table- et voila! Here it is! Like Avalon very much, played it about 8 times so far and wants new characters! But you always have to get the right persons for this kind of game, often its easy to say who will react in which way in the game. Bluffing is one of the most important things in this game and can be trained here too. No gamemaster needed (the best feature of this game!)

Probably the best version of The Resistance, but it always feels lame when a game ends with the assassin. (I hardly ever use these roles with new players.) It has a greater variety of characters that you can use to balance the game for your group (or just make it more interesting), whereas the original just had some special ability cards you could toss in if you wanted.

As advertised.  Werewolf is Werewolf; it has its own pace and intensity.  But as a mini-Werewolf (and thus arguably a better Werewolf) this does the job and then some.  The Arthurian theme and roles work very well.  The game itself can be hit or miss... but the misses are at least quick, and the hits are spectacular, sessions you'll talk about for a long time to come.

I don't quite understand why people love the Resistance more than the Avalon version. You do not have to use the special roles like Merlin if you don't want to so it is basically the same game but with more future options for when you get bored.

Got with backing the Coup kickstarter, came with the updated Mordred and Oberon cards in the Coup box.  I really like the game, but prefer playing the original's theme, so will just keep the other since it now has the "Merlin" and Assassin cards, plus the other special card things.

Gave this to Dan for a $1 because he thought about getting it anyways and he'll love it.

RATING: 7
More of the same a la Resistance, with a few tweaks. It seems a bit of an odd theme transplant, not sure I remember much in the way of hidden identity plots when studying Arthurian Legend as part of my degree at university, though Merlin and Morgana obviously have magical powers so a bit of disguise and illusion is hardly beyond them. I guess the story of Gawain and the Green Knight revolves around hidden identity to a large degree, so perhaps it's perfectly in keeping. The more complex roles which have been added demand even more that you have a group of players of similar competence and experience. I also maintain this/The Resistance is a game much better played with people you know well.

The game keeps all the core elements from the original Resistance, minus the plot cards, they can still be used but the Lady of the Lake makes them useless. The addition of roles makes for a different game which adds the initial information for Merlin, and Perceval. With multiple different characters available to play with the odds on either side, the game offers more variability and makes for an even better experience.

At first, I liked this more than resistance. But merlin sucks. Either you are too obvious and get assassinated, or other players don't pick up on voting patterns (not surprising though, it's hard to keep track of everyones votes, and justifying a vote is hard as well). 

It gets a bit better when you add the other character cards in. Still, Resistance is the better game with the plot cards.

Played once. The central part of the game is the same as in The Resistance, and here we get characters with different abilities instead of plot cards to spice it up a little.
Excellent game system and a lot of fun to play.
Update after three plays: the presence of Merlin makes it a bit easier for the resistance players. To compensate for this, the spies get an extra chance to win if they identify Merlin correctly. Just doesn't feel good to win that way. I'm now certain that I prefer the original.

Pretty much exactly like the original Resistance, except Avalon adds unique character cards. One such is Merlin, who can see who all the traitors. Another is the assassin, who may guess who Merlin is at the end of the game to steal the win for the traitors.

We play this ALL the time.  The more alcohol is involved, the more yelling there is, and it is never a quiet game.  But still, it is a great deal of fun, and laughter is always had.  Bonus: Involves lying to your friends' faces, but no one should ever get mad.  After all, you didn't choose to be a servant of Mordred - you just ruled at it.

The roles available in Avalon can be pretty cool, but it's easy to unbalance the game by using the wrong ones.  Requires some trial and error.

The game is really "Find and Kill Merlin," and every thing else is how you get there.  The problem is, that isn't a fun game.  Or at least isn't until you get to larger numbers of people, and once you have them why not just cut to werewolf?

RATING: 7
A game very similar to The Resistance, but falls short a bit due to its slightly more complicated rules and options. The role of Merlin, which sounds good on paper, actually makes the game harder for that player. Theme-wise, it also falls short compared to The Resistance, as there's the evil side, while The Resistance has both sides that believes in what they do is right. For a party game, Avalon will be less played than Resistance in our gaming group.

This has to be the ultimate large group game. The first play you're learning the game, but if you play multiple games back to back, you start to learn how to read the other players. Very interesting to see how your friends and family are as liars.

I bought this because I'd heard it improved on The Resistance, a game I loved at first but cooled on after a few players when it became same-y and felt heavily biased towards one side.

Avalon is definitely an upgrade in the components department, but that's it. It makes the easier side even better, and once I saw that -- after buying it, my mistake -- I sold it unplayed.

Lots of fun. Though you'd think it would start to get predictable after repeated plays, each game tends to play out differently (the meta-game changes your reactions), and wins are usually balanced between good and evil. I'd only want to play this with certain groups, however.

The Resitance: Avalon is a great deduction and bluffing party game.  Its ability to create a fun and engaging atmosphere is unrivaled inducing stress and laughter.  There is no downtime in this game because you are involved in every moment trying to deduce who is evil or trying to lie to show that you are not.  The Arthurian theme is present but could be more prevalent, however it does present a good context for the insanity to transpire.

The Resistance is a great game! But different from average opinion, I like the standard game (with plot cards) much more than the Avalon style with special characters. In the standard game, the plot cards distribute information among the players, so that everybody has certain information.
In Avalon a few players have very prominent roles, which are much more interesting, while the remaining players have very little to no information (only voting patterns).

It is a beautifull game of deduction. the only flaw is that are necessary skills in acting (not always a player is an actor). like resistance but with some special characters.

I played this for the first time with my wife's family at an Easter weekend retreat. There were 12 of us playing. The game turned out to be an absolute riot. We played 8 times in a row. For any game to have an effect of that magnitude on a large group is simply amazing. I was repeatedly congratulated on introducing them to such a wonderful game. Normally, I would not rate a game of this kind (a party game that is) so high, but 8 times in a row with people asking for just one more game is evidence enough for me that Avalon rocks!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just plain amazing. Improves on an already excellent game by adding additional (optional) roles. The added Merlin role really shakes things up for the good players. The additional roles beyond Merlin not only keep the game interesting after multiple plays, they also serve as balancing tools for varying skill / experience levels. For such a small package, this game offers so much fun. Easy to learn, really fast play time, and supports about to 10 players. It's hard to beat that for a $20 game.

RATING: 7
This expansion intruded alternate roles that had special powers, so it could even out the playing field if one team was winning too much. which is a fantastic idea. however the theme is not nearly as well done as the original. and  Minions of Mordrid is much harder to say than Spy. And the biggest complaint i have is the pass/fail markers are hard to tell the difference between due to the color scheme. Red is pass and black is fail. Whereas in the original, red was fail. It's counterintuitive, and the colors are too similar. it was enough to make me get rid of it and get the Hidden Agenda expansion for the original. completely replaces the Avalon edition.

It's hard to rate this particular game.  I usually carry it with me, but I find it difficult to suggest and more difficult to play with strangers.  I may stop bringing it, since it plays best with people who already know each other.

RATING: 9
The Resistance: Avalon is a superb secret-roll/secret-objective, hidden power, bluffing and deduction type card game (what a mouthful).  In it, players are dealt a character card that is kept secret.  The character cards will either be those of the good guys, i.e. members of King Arthur's court, or the bad guys, i.e. members loyal to Mordred.  Some of these characters may have a special ability.

During each round a player will act as the "King".  The King decides who to send out on missions.  Once the King has chosen who will go on the current mission everyone votes to pass the team selected.  If the vote passes those members chosen will carry out the mission, if the vote fails the mission is rejected.  In that case the player to the left becomes the new King, and the mission selection and voting process begins again.

The players selected to go out on a mission will then secretly chose from "success" or "fail" cards to determine if the mission worked out for the good guys, or not.  Once all cards are handed in they are shuffled and revealed.  For the mission to be a success everyone who went on it must have played a success card, but only one failure is required to ruin the plans of Arthur.  Good guys must vote for a success, but those devious baddies can strategically vote either for a success, or fail.

There are five missions total.  Three successes wins it for the good guys, three failures wins it for the bad guys.  Also, if the mission selection vote fails to be passed 5 times in a row the bad guys immediately win as well.

The Resistance: Avalon is a fast and fun game.  The difficulty can be modified by using more or less characters with special abilities.  The game is tense almost from the beginning.  If you're good you don't know who to trust, unless you are Merlin who knows the evil players.  If you're a bad guy, you are always trying to deflect suspicion away from yourself and onto others.

If you like this kind of game and don't own it already - buy it now!  If you are curious about getting a game like this The Resistance: Avalon is a great one to get first.

RATING: 9.9
Perfect social deduction game... Original Resistance took the BSG traitor mechanic and turned it into a great game. Avalon adds some special roles (bit like Werewolf) to the mix bringing the system to whole new level. Hard to return to basic Resistance after trying this. Lots of fun for 5-10.

Update:
With expansions, original Resistance again becomes the ultimate version (see my comment on it).. But I still recommend Avalon as a better gateway into Resistance, as it has better theme and Merlin+Assassin roles are enough for newbies anyway. And if you don't become a huge fan, this version is more than enough for occasional game or two.

Travis says: 

You may or may not have heard that there was a small misprint on two of the character cards. These cards are the special (and optional) characters Mordred and Oberon. The cards should have had the subtitle "Unknown to Merlin" and "Unknown to Evil", instead they say "Unkown to Merlin" and "Unkown to Evil" respectively. This misprint in no way affects game play.

A game of two teams trying to work together against each other.  The baddies are outnumbered but know who they other baddies are.  The goodies (with one exception) don't know who are on their side.

This leads to some great bluffing, deduction and social interaction.  Accusations abound as both sides try to get their players on to the missions to complete or sabotage them. Plays very differently depending on the group of people played with.

This version of the Resistance comes with some cards that can be used to scale the difficulty in either direction if once side has an advantage in a particular group.  Can also be used to add complexity if desired.

Nice artwork and theme, just be sure to sleeve the cards so they don't get marked (which could give away who your character is).

False accusations and betrayal are the core of the resistance, but also deduction and this version adds some strategic new characters to the game that improved it for me.

This party game will hit your table often if you have a large gaming group.

Played this 6 times on 4/1/2017 and it was a blast.  I literally came home with a smile on my face after playing.  I'm sure the group I played with had something to do with it, but I'm also sure it had to do with the fact I thought I'd really like The Resistance and that's why I purchased it.  However, this adds Arthur, his knights, & the forces of evil to that equation.

I've finally realized that I dislike this genre of game. Werewolf, Avalon, The Resistance, Secret Hitler... I come to hate them. First, someone will argue that you didn't play by working the odds. Second, someone will nuke you because you're perceived as too likely to win. It feels like an argument clinic on cards.

If you like this genre, I think Avalon is my favorite, though Werewolf is fun for a non-gamer campfire game.

A good social deduction game, with more of an emphasis on lying / deceit. The mastermind-quality of the deduction aspect works but is a simple framework complicated both by the open voting (at least that's how I played) and the possible roles (Merlin & Assassin in the games I played). I like it, about the same as One Night Ultimate Werewolf if not just a notch below (subject to change with more plays, currently I've played ONWU much more than I've played Resistance). It is longer, but that is not a bad thing in this case, as you invest yourself more in the outcome and people are just more on edge than in the single rounds of ONWU - I suspect that the odd numbers 5, 7, 9 make for the best games, as opposed to 6 (the way I played) which felt slanted towards the Resistance. Either way, you need people who won't just sit mute but really engage vocally with each other to make this game shine - and win or lose it's fun to unravel the game after to hear what everyone was thinking and why. Even without roles, just bare-boned, this game is very solid and I can't really see room for tinkering with the setup except for said roles.

A good game.

This is a preliminary rating.  I need to play this more.  The problem with this game is that it's competition is The Resistance which is a 10 for me.

If The Resistance fixed the Werewolf Genre, Avalon perfects it. This game is much more balanced than Avalon with a great check system in Merlin and the Assassin. What's more, you can easily stack the game in favor of the Loyal Knights or the Evil Minions by adding or removing certain roles or adding optional mechanics like the Lady of the Lake. This lets you balance the game with each play to help the side that can't seem to win.  You can even increase the skill level of the game to not just reward Social Negotiation skills, but also reward Card Playing skills by adding power cards from the base game.  And yet, it's stand alone!

One of my favorite Social games ever.

*August 2013* A great game to play once, maybe twice, a session. However, even though this is an improvement over the original, it's still the same resistance I got burnt out on a year ago (over many plays). 

Excellent game.

Similar to the resistance but with another flavor. I'm not sure yet if i prefer one or the other. Maybe in our game there was too much revealed by players who had inside information but i guess that I don't like it in general that so much information is known by players at the start of the game.

Broken. 

First 3: Success! Great! Add one more. Second: Success! Yay! Same team! 3-0 victory without effort. This happened almost every time in a 10 player game. The two times it didn't because a spy was lucky enough to be chosen, it was instead a 3-1.

Merlin/Mordred/Percival/Morgana/Assassin are useless as power roles, since their design requires you to play as if they didn't even exist. They all cancel each other out anyway so why bother trying? It's much easier to figure out who the spies are by looking at the votes. Why risk losing the game (it's literally an instant "you lose no matter what" mechanic) on something unreliable?

Rulebook and cards are full of typos and spelling errors. Did the designer even care?

Way too much fun. I like to bring this one to the social skills class I teach with adolescents and use the deception mechanic to give them practice at reading between the lines of what people say. The only trouble is, with the large number of players it requires, someone will inevitably miss a vital piece of the instructions, mess up the pre-game setup, and force you to start back from the beginning. Luckily, it's a short game.

The Resistance: Avalon. Able to accommodate large groups, (up to 10,) it's only drawback is it must be played with at least 5. Resistance is a great variation on the traditional Mafia party game. In this version, 2 players are secretly selected to be spies and are known only to each other. The entire group must use successive rounds of voting to hopefully ferret out the villains. The mechanics are simple and quickly taught- it’s the assessment of other players’ trustworthiness, (and eventually the yelling,) where the game really gets exciting. 

Honestly, this is one of my all time favorite games. The Avalon implementation is nice with the Arthurian theme, and the Merlin and other new cards give the game the balance it needs. And if you need the same style of gaming  for fewer players, try Coup!

Probably the one best quick games I have for a moderately large group of people.  Fast and the tension is frequently palatable.  It can sometimes fall flat based off a random good guess, but that's very rare.  Because this is a bluffing/negotiation game, in essence, it is made by the people.  If you have people that are not in the game and not paying attention then the whole team suffers -- and so does the game by extension. 

As of recently, this game has been nearly completely replaced by Coup (Kickstarter Edition).  Because of the extra cards included with that version of the game, Coup can scale up to being in the same bracket as this game.  Oddly, I find Coup better for smaller (5 or less) and larger (8+) groups, however if in the sweet spot between those numbers then the Resistance might get a chance to shine.

I can understand why this game is such a hit, but the two games I played weren't very enjoyable. If you have a large group of people who have played it a lot together and a few newbies (like we did), the game can seem pretty confusing and even unfair. The newbies in our group didn't understand a thing and were silent and timid while the veteran players figured everybody out in a matter of minutes. So there wasn't really any negotiating or even bluffing, just going through the motions and number crunching. What this means is that it's good for casual gaming ONLY if you have a balanced out player experience level. It balances a bit If you can play several games in a row, as the newbies get to learn it a bit more, but two clearly wasn't enough. But ours was probably exceptional a situation.

Summary: Great deductive fun. This game is deeper than it appears at first glance, particularly with an attentive and enthusiastic game group. 

Key Highlights:

* Fast: a game can be over in as little as 15 minutes.
* Scalability: works well from 5-10 players
* Traitorous: though it's a team game, some players are secretly working against you.

Conclusion: This game is still the number one requested game in my group. For $15? Yes, please!

I bought Avalon because I was intrigued by the simple yet deep deduction mechanisms. Avalon was one of many games that me and my friends brought for a weekend together in the countryside and it turned out to be the only game we played over and over again!

Avalon is learnt, set up and played quickly. The experience does not come from the game as such but rather from the intense interaction between the players. Every action is throughly observed and feriously discussed as each one tries to convince the others who is good and who is evil.

If you enjoy a mental challenge that engage everybody, Avalon is the game for you!

主題:1
套用圓桌武士的故事，與遊戲機制的搭配相得益彰，透過每次出任務的成功與否，來判定陣營內的內奸，很有無間道的情節，也很符合圓桌武士故事人物的設定，讓玩家很快就能融入遊戲中。

美術:0.7
圖片美工很棒，看著自己扮演的角色圖案，很能讓遊戲氣氛帶上來。配件很精美，雖然不多，卻算是能對得起這種價格的遊戲。

規則:1
規則簡單好教學，選取角色牌，主持人宣告流程分辨自己的陣營，接著主席選取騎士出任務，騎士決定任務成功與否，接下來就是一連串的爾虞我詐。直到符合玩家人數的任務達成率。遊戲規則讓這款遊戲可以玩得很有邏輯分析性，也可以玩得很搞笑胡鬧。端看玩家桌遊咖的個性取向。曾經跟小朋友玩過，小朋友也超愛的!是一款老少通吃的遊戲。

設置:1
設置很簡單，依玩家人數拿取不同的任務場景圖版，就可以開一局。另外遊戲體積小，很方便攜帶，也是這個遊戲的亮點所在。

路線:0.7
遊戲過程的攻略路線選擇，並不是遊戲制式規定的，而是玩家根據心理學，邏輯判斷，及從與對手的話語間去解讀出誰是梅林方?誰是壞人方?看看是要用虛張聲勢還是順水推舟，或是以進為退、張冠李戴，反正能找出老鼠的就是好貓。這樣海大的策略空間，就看玩家怎麼應用，玩不出所以然的人，只會覺得這是個嘴砲遊戲。

互動:1
遊戲間玩家互動強烈，很多人喜歡當梅林或是殺手，但我覺得最有挑戰性的角色反而是毫不知情的騎士甲乙，要如何從各種蛛絲馬跡中推理出好人壞人，每個玩家的角色都不一樣，採取的策略也不同，而玩家的互動就是從怎麼多的目標衝突中產生。

個人:0.8
陣營遊戲首選﹑，希望能徵得認真玩這款遊戲的夥伴，而不止只是把這款遊戲變成嘴砲歡樂的派對遊戲。

朋友:1
玩過的幾乎都能融入遊戲中，不管是大人小孩。

想玩:0.7
遊戲時間短，主題強烈，遊戲投入感十足，是個可以連開好幾場的微桌遊，
不過玩家人數要五人以上，有時比較難湊咖，且玩多場後，會覺得有點乾，需要一段時間的沉澱再拿出來玩。

收藏:1
價格合理，體積小好攜帶，可以供多人遊玩，每家必備的陣營桌遊。值得收藏。

總分:8.9
講評:除了遊戲策略不夠深入，遊戲玩家限制多人以上外，本款遊戲可說是經典中的經典，相信未來可以常常出現在每個桌遊群中。玩這個遊戲的重點就是要心理投射的將自己融入遊戲角色中，你才會體會到當內奸的快感。

This is a fantastic social bluffing game. Building off it's predecessor (the Resistance) this game adds functionality to characters giving a greater purpose to the game.

Players who take the time to include the mission of their quest (say, preparing for a feast, or hunting a dragon, or finding a cure to the pox) will add an extra element to play only enhancing the game. The success and fail cards can even be used to tell the tale, coming to yes/no success-oriented stop gaps in the telling of the story i.e. Was there wine in the cellar? Did they find it's lair? Were these the right herbs?

Hands down this is the most fun social deduction game I have ever played. Actually, this may be the most fun game I have ever played.

It keeps the betrayal mechanism from Werewolf and its ilk, but removes the need for a moderator, player elimination, some of the awkwardness (are we supposed to roleplay this or not?), and puts it in a game that takes only 30 minutes or so to play. Deduction is a much more important part of Avalon (or The Resistance, for that matter), since you can use quest outcomes and team-selection votes to reason about who the traitor probably is.

One of the other things I love about The Resistance and Avalon that I haven't seen elsewhere is that the rulebook explains what roles shift the balance which direction, so if one team is winning too much, you can change which roles you use. That's been very helpful for us, especially since we usually play several games in one sitting, and typically, the balance is a little different for different groups, so we can quickly see which roles to add or subtract to make the game more even.

A few drawbacks: One, there is so much voting, of different types, in this game that new players can easily get confused. For that matter, sometimes, I get confused in the heat of the moment. The other problem is that, since this game relies on votes where every single vote from every player matters, players who are tired or not paying attention can lead to some disastrous outcomes, when a team that should have won suddenly loses because one of its members did something completely at odds with their best interests. But, this factor does not come up very often. Of course, by far the biggest issue in this game is that you have to be able to bluff about your identity - some people (like me) have a hard time bluffing (and in this game, it can feel more like lying than bluffing) and that can be problematic. But that's true of any social deduction game.

Overall, great game; one of the best. If you like social games you will probably like it. If you like games with traitors you will definitely like it. If you like deduction games, you will probably enjoy it. If you like team games you may like it. (The only reason I don't give this game a 10 is because I think it's likely with the rapid pace of innovation in social deduction games that part of the formula may be improved upon, and if some game does manage that, I think it would probably replace The Resistance and Avalon for most purposes.)

I think the Merlin mechanism changes the game for the worse.  most of the time you can just focus on who you think Merlin is the entire game.  The side mission becomes failing missions.  That said, The Resistance is my all-time favorite social deduction line of games, so Merlin only takes off .01 from my original game score.  I did have the scores reversed because, obviously, you can just play the base game with this set, but now the expansions added the Avalon roles into Resistance, so I reversed them.  I also think the Sci Fi theme is better for this game, as well.

Wolf but with a twist. The characters add fun but still a poker/deduction game. Increased re-playability with unique roles (Merlin, Lady of the Lake, etc) that can really change the feel of the game but a bigger group is better.

RATING: 9
A great hidden role game. It's all about finding out who is evil or being clever to get others off your case. There are some special roles to help if you think it's one-sided in your group, but I find that the most fun games are played without any special roles.

Avalon was amoung my first purchases. It has never failed me everytime I pull it out of the shelf. Strictly party game, best after a few bottles of beer. Often emotionally drained (but satisfied) after each play.
This game depends a lot on the group you are playing with. It becomes the victim of its own mechanism if played with shy volks and that's why it is a 7.

Love all bluffing games and especially secret identity games. This seems awesome!
Update: Played and own print out version, buying the proper version. Everything about this game is perfect in a genre of games which I consider near perfect. Possibly best of it's type.

like Once upon a time, Aye Dark Overlord, Are you the Traitor/Werewolf, the Resistance or any similar game, these are perhaps my favorite genre of game. They REQUIRE the right group. Right group is a euphemism for people who actually have some inkling of roleplaying, charisma, fun, wit, humor, exuberance, and amicability than this game wins wins wins. Which also means that if your group doesn't like these games, it might be time to get new friends rather than a new group because it's literally their fault and not the brilliant game.

This new version of resistance mostly just adds even better components, better art, and a great new theme. The merlin and other elements are fun; not necessarily worth it on their own unless your a gigantic fan like I am in which case they are.

RATING: 6
Great 'social deduction game' - something of a Werewolf for a more reasonably-sized group of players at your standard gamenight. I find Merlin and the extra optional characters a much more accessible way of spicing up the game than the Plot Cards in the original.

My plays are tracked against the base game only.

It's a hidden team affiliation game, but boiled straight down to the speculation and deduction part without the need for roleplay and moderation (as in Werewolf) or chance (as in Shadow Hunters or Bang!).  It does, however, have the logistics issue of how to reveal team affiliations secretly to some of the players.  Played enough at Storm-Con to last me a lifetime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The issue with the original Resistance was that without plot cards, there wasn't any substantial information to base decisions on, and it could sometimes come to a coin toss. But throw in the plot cards, and you get so much info, the game becomes a game about maximizing the plot cards.

Avalon fixes that with Merlin/Assassin/other cards. M+A gives both the spies and resistance reasons to watch people. Evil wants to find Merlin and assassinate him, while Good still wants to find spies. This adds a whole new dimension and makes the game more interesting for both sides. The other side cards like Mordred, Lancelot, Percival, etc also make the game pretty interesting.

Theres no major issues I have with the game aside from just being bad at most social deduction games and being very tense/stressed under many of them. Minor issues I dislike are closing my eyes, reciting the roles accurately and in order, and the first mission where you have nearly no information. I think apps exist for this though. One way they could have improved this was have text on the character cards briefly reminding the roles, as well as having numbers on each of the character cards, so we could just call the numbers in order. That with maybe a summary sheet of all the characters to keep in the main board. A discard pile wouldn't hurt either.

If you liked this review, I recommend checking out my Resistance review as well if you want a comparison.

Plays: normal Resistance is 25+, Avalon is 5-10+ or so

Avalon is a simple re-theme of the Resistance, featuring a number of special rules only included in The Resistance's expansion packs. As a stand-alone game, it's a more robust package than the original, but for completeness you're still better off picking up The Resistance and its expansions.

This game is just absolutely great.

----
I have finally been convinced of the game's superiority to Resistance. Everyone is forced to play a more active role; even the rank and file good and bad guys can't take it easy. The focus of the game shifts to having the good guys protect Merlin and the bad guys trying to sniff him out; the backdrop of the missions becomes a secondary concern since rare is the game that minions win 3 missions outright (unless the Merlin is a newb).

Avalon (Resistance) does a great job of increasing the complexity of the spy versus spy negotiation game, while also adding a good theme. In comparison, one bad element of Werewolf is that players are eliminated during gameplay, though it fits with that theme. And one bad element of the original Resistance is the limited special abilities, though it keeps the game simple. Avalon fixes those issues, but the original Resistance is more portable.

First impression (7-8 players): For a werewolf/mafia type game perhaps the best in genre (out of very few I've tried..). No player elimination, limited # of rounds / game (=pretty short), no moderator needed, and well, not much new but all old stuff is tested and just works.

Like always though, if you really, really like the genre you might just want to proxy the game just so you can create some of the variants there is/eventually will be. But for mere mortals that play these every now and then, the roles included will probably be enough.. (haven't checked what there is ..)

This is perhaps one of the best games I have ever played.  I love econ games, strategy games, even war games, but games that play in the air, vice the board just win me over more than anything.  Games where there's intrigue, lying, backstabbing, and laughter all at once is amazing.

Now, I own werewolf, but I have not played it yet.  I own inquisition and play a lot of that.  I also own Bang and Samurai Sword and love those.

But this game beats it all right now.

Everyone wants to go again, everyone has different ways of playing.  Now granted, some people can ruin this game.  Maybe that adds to the theme of the game when someone just doesn't talk or gives terrible direction.  I had a guy who said they were the bad guy all game and when it came to the game winning choice on who went on the mission he says he's good, but no one could trust him, so the good guys lost due to that.

But when the game goes right, everyone is acting good, everyone is vying for trust.  If you can get a group of players like this, this game shines brighter than any game on your shelf.

Versione un po' più articolata di The Resistance con ambientazione nel medioevo ai tempi di Merlino e Re Artù. Oltre alle tradizioni regole di Resistance, ovvero formare squadre per missioni che dovranno essere portate a termine con successo (o sabotate se si è nella fazione del male), in Avalon i giocatori acquisiscono poteri particolari che permettono di avere alcune informazioni aggiuntive per comprendere le varie identità. Gioco a fazioni molto avvincente e semplice, necessita di intuito e un po' di persuasione. E' diventato nel tempo il gioco più proposto e giocato nelle serate in associazione. Il gioco offre il grande pregio di conoscersi di più, di ridere, di scherzare e ogni partita è una sfida indimenticabile. Per questo, seppure lo spesso strategico non è elevato e anche le regole sono due in croce, dopo diverse partite ho deciso di assegnare a questo party game l'unico 10 dato a giochi di questo spessore.

In general I like both Resistance and Avalons theme, but Avalon somehow is a little easier to explain when it comes to the good guy/bad guy thing. :D

I also like the roles a little more than the plot cards, so while I would not say no to playing Resistance, given the choice it would probably be Avalon for me.

I played this with a group of first 6, then 7 friends, who mostly know each other very well. It was great fun, and very engaging. I imagine that if you played it with the wrong kind of group it would be a lot less fun though, as the dynamic of lying and engaging quite loudly and intensely with other people might be uncomfortable with people you don't know well. 

It seemed to be very challenging being the traitors, and when we played they didn't win at all except by once guessing Merlin. However, I don't see this as a weakness - it's just tough being the traitors and you have to play smart and subtle.

A great combination of brain power, memory, bluff, face-reading, and tactics is required to play well.

Probably not worth playing with only 5 or perhaps we just need some more experienced players. 

EDIT: Played with 6 and the RIGHT kind of people and it was FUN! So important to have the right crowd for this who can figure out basic strategies (at least) and who can also get into the spirit of the game. Love it.

[i]Another new to me game played at the library meet up.
First of all this is a great group for these kinds of games since we tend to be a bit raucous. I think this game depends on having the right group dynamic, I could see it becoming very dry and procedural if played with the wrong group.

All that said I would enjoy playing it again, especially since it plays so fast, but it is not necessarily a game that I feel the need to own. Partly because someone in our group has it and I think the more players the better, I would not want to play this with less than 5 or 6.[/i]

Always a blast. Easy to learn, easy to teach. The game is best with 6-7 players. Any more, and it becomes too hard to deduce anything, and many players don't get a chance to organize a team.

Werewolf under thirty minutes! But more than just being able to detect when a person is lying to you, this game is about diplomacy. Say, for whatever reason, you know all the bad guys.

It involves skills that are more than being a human lie detector. Great for whatever size (up to ten) but it plays well with just five, too.

This is the same game as the Resistance, the only difference being the addition of new characters a la Werewolf. Meaning you can play the original with this set, meaning you would always get this over the original if you were presented with a choice. In the base, the new Merlin knows who the spies are, but the spies don't know who Merlin is. But Merlin can't give the game away, because if the good guys win, the baddies can still win if their Assassin character successfully names Merlin. It adds a great new twist, providing more to think about. There are other characters to add in for even more variety. It makes a great game even better. The theme is non-present, so it's easy to slip back into resistance/spy talk, though you get to enjoy the gratuitous but fabulous artwork for Guinevere. For those who haven't played the original, it's a really fun secret identity game of accusation and counter-accusation, with theories being thrown around on who are the baddies and who are the goodies. The start player nominates who goes on the next mission, which is then voted on, and who votes yay or nay tells you something. If the majority says nay, the next player nominates a new team for a mission. Once the majority says yay, then the players on the mission vote secretly for success or failure. Any one failure and the mission's a failure. 3 failed missions and the spies win. So the resistance players are desperately trying to work out who they are and get them and only them on the missions. The spies know who each other are, and they're trying to fool the other players into getting a spy or two onto missions so they can shoot the missions down secretly. The game really shines when clever bluff moves happen at the start which set up turmoil later and people are all over the shop. It's all over in 15 minutes as well so the time value is excellent, and being able to play with 5-10 players is a big plus as not many games do that well.

Mafia-inspired medieval subterfuge that can result in some really fun games between friends and family. A lot of it, however, is based on pure hunches, since you're just making wild accusations about who's a Minion of Mordred. It doesn't really heat up until multiple turns in.

40+ plays - Best hidden identity game (in my opinion). A much better version of this game, than 'the resistance'. The roles really add layers to the bluffing, the building of trust alliances and observing 'tells' in other players. The roles are very unique and different to play. Switched on players will begin to observe 'group patterns' that can emerge in a myriad of ways and are not always easy to pick. 

On top of this, it's really a team game. You really rely on the various team members to fulfill their role well, otherwise you lose as at team. This truly is in some ways, a fantastic cooperative experience as well - almost completely immune to alpha players as they will often need to shut up in order for others to play their role (or say a lot to hide the roles of others) :-)

It is the same exact game as The Resistance with some added abilities and variants. You can still play the base game and I have not played many of the variants, but this is a great game of discussion and bluffing. A must in any collection especially if your group is regularly 5 or more.

This is a fantastic team game and always goes down well when I get enough people together. The short play-time and re-playability make it one of the only games I own which is played multiple times in a row.

It can seem like there is very little information available to the players, especially the Loyal Servants of Arthur, but the more you play the more important and interesting these roles become, as it is really your main job to figure the mystery out or at least make the Minions of Mordred think you know, which can make you look like Merlin.

Personally I think it is pretty good, but most of my game group and family don't like social deduction games. Most of them don't get into it all that much and it ends up just being me and my brother driving things.

Very important to have the right group that will participate. Too many calculating, introverted types in my family, along with people that don't like being "mean" and accusatory.

If you have one person that won't commit and get into the game, it will totally ruin the whole experience.

RATING: 8
The Merlin/Assassin/etc. roles provide a different flavor to the game from the cards in base Resistance.  I'm not sure which one I like more, because I haven't played enough "advanced Resistance" to be sure, but they're both fine games that are at the top of my list when I'm in the mood for a social deduction-y experience.

RATING: 7.8
This game can be very, VERY fun. However, there are a few things that can hurt the experience of this game. 1. Playing with cutthroat players who always play the game with the same strategy and make the bluffing aspect of the game unfun and awkward. 2. Playing with brand new players who don't fully understand the rules. (I've had new players cost us the game by not realizing what they were doing) and 3. You NEED more players. Playing 5 or 6 players is not that fun, you need to have friends AND family to get enough people for this to be enjoyable. Having said all that, play this with a group of people who know how to play the game and just play to have fun, and it's hard to beat. It would have been rated higher if not for the reasons I listed.

RATING: 7
I like the twist it has with the regular Resistance.  The extra roles are nice adds to mix up the game more and trying to convince who's who.  We won by assassinating Merlin at the end, despite Merlin not revealing and the knights dominating the game, which felt a little cheap.

I miss the plot cards from the regular Resistance.

Finally played a few games this weekend, and it's a really fun game.  We played at an awkward player count (7 players) so my opinion may be a bit off, but the game was a lot less deduction and more guessing than I originally thought it would be.  Which is fun and all, but I feel like there is more information to play with in Secret Hitler, than in this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I definitely think this improves on the original Resistance, and it's a really great, quick deduction game. I could see how it could get a little rote eventually, but with the extra roles, that should take a while, and I'll have more than gotten my money's worth by then.

*** Traded for The Speicherstadt ***

$19

A great social deduction game that is hard to play well. It plays pretty quick since there is no down time in terms of AP but voting could get people talking and bluffing quite a lot to stall the game but that's what this game is about anyway. It has to be played with the right group of people, perhaps close friends only. It has the "let's play this again" charm. Today was the first day we give this game a shot and we played 3 vanilla resistance and 2 Avalon with Merlin and assassin.

--- Update ---
Traded in a math trade because my brother said he dislikes this game. My parents don't get how to bluff either. I think my folks are too honest. Heh.

While I prefer the science fiction theme of the original, the new options that comes with the optional roles makes me prefer the Avalon version. With this version you can play it the original way or you can add individual roles to each team to Balance the game more suitable for your game group.

The only drawback is that some games may fall flat if it's not right for the group. But very little can beat a good game of The Resistance: Avalon

2013-06-09 After read the rulebook and still feel confusing. I start to understand how to play this game by watching "Avalon Review - with the Game Boy Geek" in Youtube. Then tonight, I have tried with my 4 friends. We got crazy about it. We keep playing it for 4 or 5 games. We have tried to play 3 Good and 2 Evil guys without Merlin and Assassinate. Then after adding them 2, we feel more excited. That is why I come here to give it a 10!!!

Great party game.  Easy to understand for new people.  Great amounts of interaction.  The only thing that I would say I don't like about the game is that the special character cards can change up the balance in weird ways and that the game doesn't force everyone to make public decisions.  If someone just sits back and never says or does anything, no one has anything to make a decision on their side, whether they are good or bad.  That aside,  I like secret hitler, more because it has more mechanics and it is not solely based on trying to read someone.  I like it.  The pros over Burke's Gambit and Secret Hitler, the two we are currenly playing, is that it scales with player counts better.  Burke and Secret both have issues at the lower player counts.  All in all though this is a good party game that gamers and non-gamers can pick up quickly and enjoy.

An amazingly simple and involving Werewolf/Mafia game with terrific artwork, simple play, and quick game time. The fact that this and Resistance don't have player elimination and don't require a non-playing leader means that this is one of the first picks for a party game. I do recommend Resistance for beginners, since the extra roles in here might add confusion.

Disclaimer: I have not played [thing=41114][/thing].

[floatleft][ImageID=1453087][/floatleft]The Resistance falls into the category of hidden roles deduction games bordering on party game status similar to [thing=925][/thing]. In this standalone successor players are trying to complete quests for the good team to win the game while evil players secretly try to sabotage the quests. One player acts as a leader who assigns certain people to a quest. The players assigned to the quest secretly vote to complete or fail the quest. Players must deduce who is evil from the outcome of the quests. Each turn the leader passes to a new player. All evil players are aware of one another and some characters have special abilities such as Merlin who knows the identity of all evil characters and is on team good. Resistance: Avalon is one of those games where it flubs more often than not but when the planets align and everything falls into place the game absolutely shines.

Played 3 games at TableTop GameDay.
First 2 was a loyal follower, played it open and superficial.

Literally before I had said anything (except perhaps "What?" when asked if I was red or blue - I seriously didn't know what they meant, having not looked at the colors of the cards before) one of the experts said I was a bad guy.
If rampant knee-jerk speculation based on  specious guessing is what this game is all about, you can count me out.

RATING: 10
This is by far my favorite social deduction game. Whether 5 or 10 players Avalon has the ability to be fun and exciting throughout the entire time. The more you play the better it becomes as your own group develops a meta and learn more about each other's habits.

To newcomers, the rules can be a bit confusing as there are many similar "phases" to the game (player mission voting, player succeed/fail voting) while having completely opposite mechanics such as the 5th turn rejection "absolute power". The finesse of Avalon only comes out after multiple games and multiple dialogues about the game. 

The inevitable conflict where one day a player does some wacky decision to break the constructed meta, but cannot convince anyone else that it "works" because in reality it may or may not work, and though there is good intention in it, the articulation is never as good as the result which is infected with the great part of Avalon - the unpredictability.

It is, in my groups (which I agree with) THE bluffing and social deduction game which has more elegant and less randomness as the base "The Resistance" game which Avalon stems from.

In the beginning the games will be chaotic, players will screw up or do something that just backfires, but again, the longer Avalon is played - like fine wine, the better it becomes. What makes this game so fun both in and outside of the game is that the conversations about the game - outside of the game - is just as important as what happens inside of it.

I have a relatively small group of people that I'm able to game with, so this has only made it to the table one night.  We played with seven and it was a lot of fun.  The only issue that I ran into is that most of the people were quite quiet and it took away from the social deduction.  A few of the new people also didn't realize how to be strategic in what they were doing, so it made it hard depending on what team they were playing.

Avalon is The Resistance meets Werewolf, adding a nice bit of flavor to the game mechanics with special roles. Playing with Merlin certainly changes the feel of the game a lot asit gives the traitors a second shot at victory- sometimes simply by getting a lucky guess, which wont interest some fans of the old Resistance. The good news is, you can play the original Resistance just fine using this set and you can even use the old plot cards, even though the art style doesnt match up.

This was the first big name board game me and my game group played and it has been played at least a hundred times since its introduction. The deception is amazing and it still comes off the shelf for a good reminiscence every once in a while. My only qualm, in highly familiar groups in 5-7 player games, the odds of winning are oddly dependent on where everyone is sitting around the table.

Fun game.  But you need the right crowd.  Not recommended for younger children.  If one person doesn't play this game with the right attitude (or doesn't understand the game well), it can ruin the game for everyone.

Very competitive game.  People will get 'worked up' when this play this game as they argue for their position.

With small groups we play with 2 special roles (Merlin and Assassin).  With larger groups we add 2 add'l hidden roles.

As much as I've overplayed this game, it's still addictive as hell. I've never distrusted people so much in my life and had such a fun time doing it. I've also had some of the biggest laughs in my life playing this game. It's fantastic and extremely well designed. It beats normal Resistance with the addition of Merlin and Percival, which IMO, add a lot to the experience.

This is a masterclass in lean, devilish game design. And it can fit in a handbag.

Almost nothing happens with the playing pieces. It's all about how players explain those minimal actions in very tense debate around the table.

It is astonishing how much the game challenges players in subtle ways. It tests their ability to lie consistently and their ability to judge exactly when to pass verbal hints. Some players will be on your side and try to help you - but only IF they are able to deduce that you are on their side.

You'll need to back-up your lies with evidence in the form of people's behaviour/choices you remember from previous rounds. So there is a strong-ish 'memory element', which I usually hate in a game, but which creates delicious conflict here. An innocent error can easily be portrayed by others as a lie, so you have to watch your step constantly.

This really does feel like one of those games where adding expansions would stop it being so great. It adds the 'Merlin' and Lady of The Lake elements to its almost-identical The Resistance predecessor, which are excellent, but that is all it needs. 

I can't recommend it highly enough. The only reason I don't give it 10/10 (a score I've only awarded to one game so far) is that it still has that 'love it or hate it' factor. It is possible to go away from the game feeling embarrassed and stupid if things went wrong. Most times, however, it is very rewarding.

Resistance / Resistance: Avalon
(Played Avalon - but prefer vanilla Resistance)

Replaces Werewolf for the simple fact that in the latter, a player can be eliminated before the first turn, spending the next 45 minutes or so watching the others play.

The Resistance is a lot tighter, has a lot more player interaction and involvement, with just as much tension - if not more - for all involved. The impact of truculent players is greatly lessened in Resistance, whpich can transform a Werewolf session to watching paint dry.

Re-rated: 1 point decrease due to Deception: Murder in Hong Kong. Also, my initial rating may have been inflated by 0.5 points.

This version of Resistance outdoes the original by a landslide, in my opinion.  I'm a big fan of the Arthurian theme, and although my group doesn't necessarily role play, we do have a lot of fun committing blasphemous acts of treachery during the game.  I really like the artwork in this game, and I enjoy experimenting with the different roles.  Surprisingly, this game even works quite well at the lower player counts.

My issue with the original Resistance is that the optimal way to play is solely to engender trust.  Once your group learns to do that the game loses a lot on tension.  Avalon fixes that by giving everyone a reason to be deceptive!  Merlin makes every game tense, even for experts.  A-C-M. A-Always, C-Claim, M-Merlin. Always claim Merlin, always claim Merlin.

The Resistance is a near perfect social deduction game. Few other games can create so much tension.

Unfortunately, I have some minor qualms. The Assassin can win games for free if they get lucky on the Merlin guess. I don't mind it when the Assassin deduces who Merlin is -- this part is fine. The issue is that sometimes it feels like an arbitrary coin toss. Not sure how this could be fixed. The Merlin/Assassin dynamic is interesting enough that the game is better in spite of that luck factor.

Additionally, The Resistance desperately requires everyone at the table to be engaged and aware of all the rules from the get-go. One player who isn't paying attention can easily ruin a game by inadvertently revealing their role or by voting carelessly.

Probably my favorite hidden role game out there.

UPDATE: After playing it a lot and playing games like Mafia de Cuba and Spyfall, I vastly prefer those two over this one. Dont get me wrong, Avalon is still a fun game, and its definitely a great game to get people interested in Hidden Role games, however I feel like games like Avalon and Werewolf dont give you too terribly much to go on to make any accusations or assumptions. In Mafia de Cuba, as the Don, I can do some mental gymanstics and deduce who may be telling the truth and whos lying based on whatevers left in the box by the time it gets back to me and how many I took out in the beginning, it gives me something to go off of. Likewise, Spyfall, if someone seems like they gave a vague answer, its easier to make assumptions and think they could be the spy. In Avalon, the first 2 rounds are essentially meaningless, even the bad guy will throw in successes every time. It really doesnt start to matter until round 3. So its still a good game, however its no longer my favorite hidden role game.

Played 8 times in a row with 6 complete newbies (myself included). This was not with my usual gaming group, with a mix of hardcore gamers, casual gamers and 1 non-gamer.

Went surprisingly well, and after a couple games of figuring out how you figure things out (i.e. when you vote for teams) people really got into the game with very different play styles. Even the first few games were interesting/enjoyable so much so that after about 8 games and 5 hours people (who generally get bored playing games) were still asking for another game.

Update1:
Played another 6-7 games with a different group. Very similar findings compared to previous group. Although greater number of non/casual gamers meant that they were still struggling to figure out the game by the end of the session. Everyone very much enjoyed it non the less, more sessions planned with same group.

I have to admit that I know next to nothing about the world of King Arthur and Merlin. So when this was brought out I was as lost as a possum driven out into the bush and dumped. People were talking about minions of someone? Merlin is good or bad? Who's this other guy? So when we started I cocked up and opened my eyes at the wrong time... restart. On the reset I was still wondering who the hell I was - out shoots my thumb - quick, put it back in, I don't think that's me - I'm sure it was so quick it'll be okay. Luckily it was. Quick, we're playing, I better read the rule book - that'll throw them. (Yes, I have played The Resistance before, but if I only play a game once a year I tend to forget what's what.) So after a round this started to become familiar. After two I get what's going on -  the symbols are different to The Resistance, but it's mostly the same game. People seemed fairly easy to pick and the bad guys chose the wrong Merlin - me. See! I threw them by reading the rule book while we were playing. (I really know how to ruin the fun sometimes.) And for me that's the difference between The Resistance and Avalon - an incompetent player such as myself can do his side a favour and throw the bad guys off Merlin's trail, whereas in The Resistance an incompetent player is just a crap player.

I prefer The Resistance for the theme and the action cards. I was never interested in King Arthur's world.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This one is tough because I think this is a better version of The Resistance. The plot card in the original game were fun but could be very random, and the fact that they were public information often made them hard to play well.

This game does not have the plot cards, and replaces a number of card components with counters (a great thing), but the 'default' Merlin hunt game, I just don't like too much. Don't get me wrong it works just fine, but even with a resistance team playing a perfect game, the spies have a 1 in 3 or 4 chance of winning, just through blind odds. 

The best variant is Excalibur, which is a promo, but you don't really NEED the promo card just the rules. IMO vanilla Resistance + Excalibur is the best way to play, the other modules  such as Merlin or Plot cards, while I will play them and do enjoy them, are fun but at times add too much randomness to a very pure bluffing and deduction game.

RATING: 9.5
This may be the best party game of all time. The accusations, the recriminations, the yelling, the screaming... and it takes a minute to learn the rules. And at that price, I can't think of a game that you can get more playtime out of. It's difficult to find a game that plays 10 gamers well, but this game actually works better at higher numbers... in fact I'd go as far to say that you haven't played it until you've played with 10 and all the extra characters at once.
The fact that you can also give the goodies and the baddies the edge by cherry-picking extras such as Oberon and Morgana really give this game an edge over every other sort of social deduction game that I've come across.

If you regularly have 6 - 10 people gathered around a gaming table then minimise this window and go order Avalon.

This is social gaming done right... well... that's understating things. This is THE game you want for social relaxed, drinking or non-drinking fun. Non-gamers seem to love it. Gamers seem to love it. EVERYONE seems to love it.

It is awesome. As with Resistance, a little over half the group is panicking and trying to ascertain who amongst them is a spy while the spies are sitting back and plotting the most efficient way of sowing discord, while failing missions and keeping themselves hidden. Avalon throws in a number of roles, the most dynamic of which is 'Merlin'. Merlin knows who the spies are, but cannot give himself away, cause if the spies fail to thwart the Resistance's missions, they can still win if they work out who Merlin is.

Everybody loves this game and, if by some miracle this doesn't end up being your cup of tea, hopefully you can see that everyone should at the very least play try it once.

Nothing says family time more than lying right to your spouse's face! We love this hidden role, betrayal game with our friends and family. We don't play this with the younger kids but with adults we have a blast. I am always accused of being a minion and I always talk too much trying to get people to spill their role. So much fun, usually gets multiple play throughs and is fun with all different player counts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
It's a better Resistance. My problem with Resistance it's that it's both too flat yet too thinky for players making it into something less flat. Avalon adds just enough to make topography uneven and dynamic and in this landscape there are jumping points and holds for players to make their moves. (Like being loud and bossy as a resistance to make spies think you're Merlin). But it's still Resistance. (Maybe further play will make me appreciate the game more).

This is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. It's fast, easy to learn, and hilarious to play with a group. I've done it from 6 to 10 players and it's always funny as heck to hear the wild accusations and to be the one deceiving others. It is a fantastic party game and I'll play anytime.

RATING: 7
Essentially Resistance with a few special roles thrown in in the mix. I played one 6P game with Merlin and the Assassin, and my first thought is how it made the Resistance more similar to Werewolves by introducing a Seer (Merlin) - a good guy who knows the identity of the bad ones, yet can't give away his or her identity too easily. It changes the way the Merlin player behaves and reacts, so players have to be extra observant. However, I guess it is possible to play the Avalon version with the original Resistance by simply marking some of the cards with the special roles.

For me, this is far superior version of Resistance. Merlin and Assassin mechanic is incredible solution, much better than Plot cards. Also, other special loyalty cards allow you to tweak the balance so the game works perfectly in any number of players. And last, the theme is better.
P.S. Resistance is rated 7 (after 40+ plays).

Not a big fan of the fantasy theme. Could never really get into the gameplay. Most games are just dominated by the social outspoken, or devolve into people yelling back and forth.

How much fun this game is (and even whether there is any point in playing at all) depends *heavily* on the group of players. It does not work with groups that don't talk to each other and simply reduce the game to the mere base rules (select a few team members, then vote), and it absolutely does not work with people who decide they prefer to play (and especially vote) completely randomly. Then again, many games don't work well when playing with douche bags.

The best party game I've ever played. 

* It does need a larger group, and the "right" group for the game to be fun. If you have people who don't enjoy making wild accusations, then this game will fall flat. But with the right group, the game is absolutely hilarious. 
* There is enough information shown indirectly through the game so that it isn't random, yet there is enough hidden to make everyone doubt themselves.
* The roles cards are brilliant

Resistance with extra roles. The extra roles are OK except...

Downside is the bad guys can randomly guess Merlin at end and "win" without really deserving it.

RATING: 7.2
Better than The Resistance, due to the Merlin aspect and the option to add other characters to the deck (superior to Plot Cards).

After a number of plays, it seems like emotions may get more heated since players are being accused of being overtly evil, whereas in Resistance, players are either Rebel or Spy; it's subtle, but noticeable with playing both games with the same group over a short span of time.

RATING: 6.5
Hey!  Someone wanted to update Werewolf, great.  It works well, and it certainly eliminates the first turn random elimination that comes with the classic design.  In fact, everyone is in it until the end, which is nice.  That said, with smaller numbers (5 especially) there aren't really any surprises by the last two rounds.  It really needs more people to be even remotely interesting.  I have the base Resistance, I don't need to double down and get this as well.

Retheme and expansion to the Resistance.  I'm not crazy about the Arthurian theme, but the new roles add an extra layer of strategy and intrigue to an already-solid game.

Excellent party game, ideally for 5 or more (7 or more better).
Each person gets a card, saying they are good or bad. A group then vote of who should go on a mission, the good want it to succeed, the bad want it to fail. Have to try to work out who is good and bad, and identify them. No one dies partway through a game, no moderator required.

New version of original Resistance - King Arthur theme. If I want a game for lots of numbers, this is the best one (ranked no.1 too)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great party game, major improvement over Werewolf/Mafia while keeping it at the same complexity level.  No need for a moderator to sit out, nobody gets eliminated, and more factors to think/bluff about.  Additional roles are a nice addition.

Having played this and the original Resistance with various groups, my major issue with the game is that it doesn't really "click" with new players the first games, and typically aren't interesting game sessions.  You really have to push people over that initial hump to get to interesting gameplay.

RATING: 8
At first glance, appears to add a not unwelcome level of additional strategy, but I'm not convinced yet that this doesn't just come down to one question at the end: has Merlin overplayed enough for the Assassin to guess correctly? All the rest of the guessing and second-guessing and double-bluffing comes down to that final guess, which means that instead of the outcome depending on everybody's interactions, now it just depends on the Marlin player.

Always willing to play, it's especially good for large "party" companies.

This is a fun lite game that is easy to teach to anyone and everyone. It's enjoyability, however, really depends on the group you're playing with.

Also a good game to test your poker face!

Avalon is The Resistance with a bit more information and intrigue. The Merlin and Assassin roles are much better additions than the plot cards of the original, changing the game for the better without making it clunkier.

This is one of the games in my collection that will span the divide between my gaming friends, and non-gaming relatives. At Christmas 2014, we were going to my aunt and uncle for the day; I knew that eventually talk would swing round to playing a game and that we'd probably end up playing the logo game or trivial pursuit. Needless to say that I was keen to avoid this eventuality. I instead convinced them (some more grudgingly than others) to give Avalon a go. What a result; the first game was quickly followed up by 2 re-matches and it's fair to say that they will request I bring this next time!

Great fun.

Same game as "The Resistance" but it adds roles to the game. The roles overall don't seem interesting and can easily add imbalances as well as confusion (the phase where you close your eyes gets really confusing without a moderator like in werewolf!).

A more mechanical version of Mafia/Werewolf. Games like this and Shadow Hunters make Mafia basically obsolete. Quite good. The five player game is pretty terrible though.

Very solid team deception game. Best in an environment where everyone knows each other well and can key off of body language and unusual behavior. I find this game works best with 7 or 8 players so there isn't too much talking over each other but there are still enough different personalities to make situations confusing.
The different roles allow for some great variations and although I play Dark Moon more often to fill this need, I know I will still be keeping this game handy.

I am very reluctant to play always pray for the game to end fast so that we can play something else.

It's just brilliant. Only a few rules to get your head around and then it's just unrelenting accusations of lying left, right and centre. Plays quickly so you can get straight back into accusing your family and friends of being deceitful pigs.

Really keen to try with a 10 person group.

[Indie Boards & Cards 12 edition] The variable adds several new roles.  The introduction of Merlin is fun.  In all, this version adds an interesting twist.

The components are upgraded.  Now voting tiles are used instead of voting cards.  The illustration is as good as "The Resistance".  Multiple game boards are handy.

I'm kind of "done" with Avalon now. It's been a wildly enjoyable ride over the last 5 years of playing this game and I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat. But, my group is now so far into the meta that the game feels like it has become a self parody, with the same rote behaviours and phrases being trotted out each game.

RATING: 6.75
Rating is based on comparison to The Resistance base game. It is decent, but really the only variant I enjoy (from the ones I've tried) is Merlin. Everything else adds a lot of layers of complexity that don't really do much for the heart of the game.

EDIT: Lady of the Lake is okay. I prefer "Trapper" Module but Avalon doesn't give enough voting cards to make that variant possible with 8+ players. Thus why my rating has been lowered slightly (7 to 6.75).

I love both The Resistance and The Resistance: Avalon.  I get a lot of non-frequent gamers to play as well and they come back for more.  It sometimes takes them a couple tries to keep a straight face when getting through the character cards and determine who is good or bad, but overall it is very well received.  The Resitance: Avalon adds a LOT more depth than the Resistance with the variant character cards.  Using the assassin and Merlin is awesome.  You can pick and choose who you want to add or none at all.  If you had to choose between the two for which to buy, get Avalon.  You'll love it!

RATING: 7
Accessible and fun group deduction game. At the start of the game players are aligned with either those loyal to King Arthur or the Minions of Mordred. A leader is chosen who then has to form a team of a certain number to perform a mission. Secretly, players either chose to succeed to mission or fail the mission and once one side has managed to successfully succeed/fail three missions, they are victorious. The game plays exactly the same way as the original 'The Resistance' with much speculation and accusations on who is aligned with who, which makes for a light-hearted interactive and highly communicative experience. Where the game differs greatly, and where it justifies its existence as a separate publication, is with the introduction of roles, whereby players can play Merlin (who knows who the Minions are), an Assassin (who can kill Merlin at the end of the game if they can deduce who he is), Percival (who knows who Merlin is and can therefore attempt to protect him), and others who add various layers of complexity to the proceedings and seem to interact with at least one other character in some way. With a largish group (between 5 and 10) who are willing to not take things too seriously, this can prove to be a memorable and replayable gaming experience.

A tense game of deceit and treachery. Don't get this game if you don't like to lie or being pressured in games. This is for people who like to try and read other people's behavior.

It's fun and fast, one of my favorites in this category, especially since there's no player elimination.

Oh wow this game is good. Been well liked by nearly everyone I played with so far.
This "party" game also does not need a strict party atmosphere. Unlike e.g. "One Night Ultimate Werewolf" which can be a stale experience if not everyone is into actively contributing and talking, this one is more thinky and does not require that. If you want you can also just wait and see for some time. For that reason I would argue that it's a better introductory party game than ONUW. The only time I would prefer ONUW is with smaller kids or reeeeally drunk people.

The only small negative I can see about the game is that after some rounds it can get a bit exhausting to play as Merlin or the bad guys.

As this comprises most of the elements of the normal Resistance and it's expansions in one box and nobody cares about the theme 1 minute into the game anyway, get this one.

usually gonna be an opener game or ender game in our gaming group.

Why it is a 7:

Easy to get played: The short play time, the easy rules, and the low profile make this game a really easy one to get to the table.  Whether it is a game or two in the margins of larger events, or a night of constant arguments, this game sees a lot of play.

Deduction: One of the less commonly utilized mechanics in boardgames, deduction mechanics make this game more novel, keeping it from having to compete for its time slot with potential competition.

Teams: Another mechanic that is not added to games often, splitting the players into teams allows them to work cooperatively against an intelligent foe, the best of both worlds.

Why it is not an 8:

Mistake prone: It is not unheard of for people to make movements or noises that divulge their alignment when the minions are supposed to see each other, or throw a fail when they are a loyalist, or accidentally flip their loyalty card onto the floor, or some other mistake that compromises the integrity of the game.  This is probably because of the easy to play nature; people who are tired or inebriate would be up for this where they would avoid something more taxing, and so are more likely to make mistakes.  It isn't a big issue, since the game is so quick to set up and start over again, but it is a problem that is somewhat peculiar to this game (and most social deduction games I assume)

Why it wouldn't be a 9 if it were an 8:

Play is mostly for one team: Most of the interesting choices that emerge during game play really center around the Minions of Mordred team.  Who to put on missions, what to throw on the mission, and whether to pass/fail a mission are all potentially strategic choices that the minions can make.  Loyalists, however, usually have a pretty clear choice based off of the knowledge they have at that time: Either try to put several minions on the same mission or none, don't vote for missions if you think it will fail without giving new information, and you always have to pass the mission.  There are some plays that can be more interesting for the loyalists to make, and the additional roles can spread the decision making love around, but in general, the minions get to make most of the interesting decisions.

Can be powerless to affect the game state: This is another rare occurrence which can color this game's experience.  An example would be 5 players, the minions are sitting next to each other, and the first play goes to the person to the left of the minions.  If that player puts himself and the next person in play order on a team, it will pass.  Then the next person does the same two and adds the next person, it will pass again, then they do the same team again, and it is game over for the minions.  There isn't any real persuasion the minions can attempt to avoid this outcome, because if they were loyalists, they would have just as little information as the other loyalists and there is no reason to distrust anyone at that point. At best, the minions could say that they are a loyalist and therefore know the 3-player team will fail, but that is what a minion would say, isn't it? The problem here is that a minion against a non-novice team who is resistant to emotional appeals could find themselves losing before they had a chance to introduce noise into the loyalists decisions besides the "I know I am a loyalist" line (which should be expected from everyone anyway). 

Why it wouldn't be a 10 if it were a 9:

Advanced play is limited to thwarting the meta:

RATING: 7
This game continues to grow on me and certainly in my game groups, it is easy to pick up but not at all easy to understand strategy or how one should behave. Using more characters definitely makes the game better, although makes thing difficult for newbies.  Fortunately one does not feel like he blew the game since usually it is a team effort and no one person is at fault; so it's well constructed on a lot of levels. The voting is more confusing then it needs to be because there are two sort of votes and they are vastly different, once this difficult concept is grokked the rest is easy to explain (oct '14). 

However, it is better than Resistance in part because you pick more players for the quest and in part because of the characters. If you like Resistance you'll like this even more. 1/25/14

French review of Resistance Avalon on Vin d'jeu: http://www.vindjeu.eu/2016/08/02/the-resistance-avalon/
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really like The Resistance, though am pretty burnt out on it. Avalon adds a 'seer' which I like the idea of, but essentially means two things: 1. The seer must be extremely subtle in convincing the other resistance members as to whom to trust, lest he be found out. Perhaps so subtle that the role becomes useless. This is because the spies then get to pick one person, guess the seer correctly and they win regardless. 2. The spies can now also win through dumb luck. In a 6 player game, they have a 1 in 4 chance of randomly winning the game by guessing correctly. It really shouldn't take any information for them to be able to determine who actually knows who they are...

RATING: 9
A wonderful, refined experience with plenty of options for variation. Need to sleeve the cards in here-- that's how much I've played it.
EDIT: Dropped to a 9, because I've realized the Assassin is fundamentally flawed. Even a perfect victory from the good guys with a flawless Merlin can be trashed by a random guess. A 1 in 3 chance with 5 players. It's also mostly insignificant-- a worst case scenario makes it a 1 in 3 chance half the time-- less than 17%, and even lower at higher player counts, but it bothers me for some reason. Yet this, aside from the impossibly ugly box, is the only flaw in a nearly perfect game.

I am going to have to play this more to refine this rating, but my first impressions are quite good.  I really like the simplicity of the missions to conceal and root out the traitors.  

If some of the variants work out well I could see this easily achieving a 9 on my list, with a small possibility of a perfect 10.

Update: I am putting this as a 9, we played with Oberon and Merlin, both were great additions to the game.  I am continuing to like this game more and more, I had so much fun yesterday I am thinking of making this a 10 but want to wait a bit more

Update: I am now putting this as a 10, we have had so much fun with this game.  I feel bad putting it at a 10, next to Rebellion which is such a complicated well thought through game, but I just have to give it a 10.  It is like the King of Tokyo logic, it might not deserve a 10, but on a scale of fun it is one of the funnest games I have ever played.

Surprised to find that I like this game so much, as I have never been a fan of mafia. One of my favorite games in our collection, though sometimes you have to have the right group. Has also went over well with kids as young as about 7-8 years of age. I love deducing the game out loud whether I am evil or good and finding interesting interactions with other players even when I am a basic good or evil character. Highly recommend, wish it was playable at lower numbers so we could bring it out more.

* Rating down just a little bit, the game is still always a blast but some characters have no info to go on at times which makes it pure guessing (though the conviction of the guess can effect gameplay if they choose correctly)

I don't like [thing=41114][/thing], and my main complaint is that you don't have enough data points to work with and the game mostly revolves around which players you think are lying.  [thing=128882][/thing] improves on that because of the Merlin/Mordred roles that reveal more information to both sides.  It's still not really my cup of tea and - as with all games like this and [thing=147949][/thing] - I always have more fun if I'm on the "good guys".  But, it's clearly better than basic [thing=41114][/thing], so I'll give it credit for that.

A more condensed version of lengthier social deduction games such as Werewolf, without the player elimination. While many see this as making it superior, I don't think it carries the complexity and possibilities of Werewolf, but does a good job of capturing it in an easier to play, shorter setting - making it more accessible and more suitable for certain situations and gamer groups. This is a fantastic intro into social deduction, light but still with a lot of depth.

To me this game always feels very tense. I rather like the roles, but Merlin guessing can seem a bit random - especially at a low player count. A suggested solution given to me by someone at my friendly local game store, was to make the guess of the assassin voluntary and happen before the last mission - so that she will still have a hope of winning if she does not assassinate. It seems worth trying, but I haven't done so yet.

Is more always a better idea? I'm not so sure in this case. I love the core of resistance, and i think it really rocks at its basic form. Introducing more to it (either with the expansion for the other game, or with Merlin/Morgana/Percival/Arthur here) increases the complexity, without an equal increase in fun. 

I'll play this game with joy, but I think it's much harder for newcomers to be immersed with all these half-necessary additions.

Update: OK I admit it, more is a better idea!

What I like:

The best social deduction party game! I love being a bad guy trying to hide my identity and tank the missions. I love being a good guy and deductively point out the bad guys. I love having extra information and being powerful like percival. I love trying to play dumb as merlin. All of it is just so fun.
We've had games of Avalon that are still talked about for months and years to come. Sometimes someone is just so damn clever or sneaking and fools the entire table and that is nothing short of epic. No player elimination like warewolf, and the characters are optional if you don't know  if you prefer regular resistance. 


What I dislike:

It seems really really hard for the good guys to win. If the bad guys don't stay hidden for some reason and play too obvious, then Merlin usually have to try and give out some minor hints to his teammates, but none spots these hints like the bad guys cause they are actively looking for them and have a lot more information when interpreting the votes.
Also, you need a big group. It's most fun with 7-10 players and it's very rare I can organize this so I don't get to play it as much as I want.

Prefer this over The Resistance because of the roles and theme. They are quick to learn/use and I like them over the plot cards from Resistance, which can actually drag the game out by quite a bit. 

Merlin adds a lot of strategy to the game. I know something similar now exists in the Resistance but this came as a complete package.

RATING: 2
Oh, dear god, how I loath this game! It is basically a shouting contest with little to no logic to sustain any argument, for one side or the other. I had a particularly good position to testify this, once I was Merlin, and could see the "reasoning" of the loyal players to find the traitors. One of the player was 100% sure (and he was wrong) that a player was a traitor, and any of my reasons to change this were ignored, and remember I did know in which side was every player. 

Since only a baseball bat would change the mind of some of the loyal players, the loyalist lost 3 to 2 in the missions. But we would also lose by the Assassin, since basically only this other player and I were really talking in the loyal side, and since this other player was wrong, there could be only one option for Merlin. And this is also something I really did not like: even if the traitor do everything wrong, they still have a good shot to try to find Merlin and win the game, by simple luck.

I'm aware that the game can be better with more players and more talkative players in the table. But this experience was so dreadful that I fear I would be hard pressed to say yes to this game again.

I just can't agree that [thing=128882][/thing] or its older brother are [thing=37111][/thing] with all the good parts of this one concentrated in 30 minutes of playing time. How? There isn't all that much at stake - the game is too short for anyone to really care about discovering or not the traitors - I will indeed [i]want[/i] to be right about the roles of everyone, but if you aren't, you just shrug, while in [thing=37111][/thing] the feeling of treason are much bigger, the betrayal cuts way deeper, because you are invested in the game, you see the resources going down, the failed crises, you look the dire space battles, so everything is more colorful, with more at stake.

Sure, [thing=128882][/thing] is a game that can have room for up to 10 players, and it can be played relatively fast (though the arguments can extend), but even in its small time, I don't feel at all rewarded for playing it. The little I used was just wasted.

This is an interesting strategy game which bases itself on the legend of Merlin. There is more involved in the setup, and understanding the rules, than in the actual game play, but it is still a fun party game. Encouraging people to indulge in the social aspect takes it up a notch. Guessing who is good, who is bad, and who is Merlin requires all of your attention.

Very entertaining social interaction game for groups of 5 - 10. Played it with a group of 9 - 10 comprised of gamers and non-gamers. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. (There might have been one or two hardcore gamers who ended up playing this "party game" only because no one else was playing anything else and didn't really enjoy themselves that much. Everyone else had a great time.) 

Played three times in a row and the "bad guys" won every time. Fortunately there are variants which are supposed to improve the odds for one side or the other, depending on the group's needs.

RATING: 9
This is a game where I have literally never witnessed a bad game. Only reason for not giving this game a 10 is that sometimes the theme can be a bit too "fancy" for some non-gamers so they might shy away from it. The roles are fantastic and are the reason why our group can easily play this game ten times in a row (atleast percival, merlin, morgana and mordred should be included literally every game even with only 5 people). The other reason is that the game is very fast so losing does not feel too bad. I highly recommend to play with Excalibur since it adds a lot to the game (you don't need the expansion for it, just use some plastic sword as an Excalibur and it works perfectly). It is also extremely important that as a host you use some time to explain the idea of the roles (percival should act like merlin etc..) and some general strategy (don't always vote yes for the suggested team etc).

I like this version way more. For one thing, the art actually looks better. The bad guys look very distinct from the evil traitors. It is easier to understand that there are evil knights in King Arthur's court. Compare this to the futuristic Resistance where the roles are a little more confusing since the traitors are actually government agents. The art work is also less clear cut. I know these comments are just nitpicky given gameplay is almost exactly similar, but Avalon gets a thumbs up from me. 

Still, I already own the regular old resistance and it is hard to justify getting a brand new copy.

Logo de cara, fiquei impressionado como um jogo com regras tão simples pode ser tão interessante e divertido. Apesar de muito fácil de aprender, ele guarda muita diversão e uma rejogabilidade excelente. Interessante também que, apesar de ter tabuleiro e cartas, não dá pra definí-lo em nenhuma das duas categorias. Posso ter ficado um pouco impressionado por ter sido meu primeiro "jogo moderno", mas até agora é um dos tops. Joguei apenas com os personagens obrigatórios (Merlin e Assassino), talvez usar todos os opcionais possa torná-lo desnecessariamente complexo, mas até agora isso é só uma impressão. Talvez o seu único defeito seja exatamente o inverso do Hive, o número mínimo de 5 jogadores. A não ser q vc tenha um grupo fixo de jogatina, fica um pouco difícil chamar uma galera "novata" pra um jogo q a princípio pode "assustar".

A very light bluff your role and vote game. Some of the roles are quite useless and/or allow guess victory condition (which is always a big minus in my books) but nothing forces one to use them. What you have is a resistance plus, some additional elements that add slightly to the original and a cleverly different theme that allows sci-fi allergic people to give this game a go.

A bluffing game of the werewolf variety where several players are spies, and the group tries to figure out who the spies are and who the loyal resistance members are. Lots of deductive reasoning, plus bluffing. 

Avalon is just the original The Resistance game with some extra optional expansion cards added. Get this and not the original game, as The Resistance had optional cards that didn't work well; whereas the optional expansion cards in Avalon do work well, though I like to just play the base game without them most of the time.

I prefer One Night Ultimate Werewolf to this game, but if you like either one, I suggest you get both, as they are much different, even though they are the same kind of game. Also, I highly recommend Coup if you like this game, as it's also the same type of game yet unique.

The game is fun, but a little stressful haha.  I think I like Coup because it feels more like small acts of deceit and bluffs.  If you're bad in The Resistance, you really have to put yourself into full liar mode for a solid 30 minutes.

The game can be utterly amazing, or completely lackluster depending on the people you have.

This is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. The ultimate battle of Good vs. Evil.  Can be highly stressful and involves a lot of strategy and social awareness. Some friends can ruin it if they are not fully engaged. Playing with new players is always fun, especially when you see them get addicted to it (like I did) once they play it for the first time and really understand it. 7 players is the ideal number but if you can get 9 or 10 it's just insanely awesome. Playing with 5 players can become stale after a few games. The Pros heavily outweigh the Cons because I have never played any other game like it, and it's only $20. Big time 10/10

I tried to bring this game to the table on numerous occasions but due to the theme and fiddly nature of the components it was always derisively sidelined...until!

This game was pure brilliance, all who played were consumed with logic, deduction and blind faced lying. Conversations repeatedly broke out in factions trying to bluff and counter bluff and I looked on smiling at just how great board games can be... 

So why'd I give it a 9 star review? The fiddly components that barely get seen and seem to stand in th at of smoother gaming... But ultimately if that's all I've got to complain about, it doesn't seem that to spoil much of anything really!

The roles that Avalon adds to the Resistance add levels of deduction to an already great game without hardly any rules overhead. The only reason to own The Resistance over this is if you prefer the theme (since many of the roles could be incorporated without additional components).

2015: Pretty good mechanics, light social deduction game. I enjoy playing it occasionally but I'm not into especially "social" social deduction games like this too often. It's a tad boring if you're just a normal good guy and it's kind of like you're just there to be another option for the named character to suspect. For a game of this type, it's very good though and I usually end up having fun. 
6/2016 update: Increased score by 1. Definitely a game that you need a game or 3 to start to fully appreciate and play at full capacity. My primary complaint of needing a special role to have the MOST fun remains valid though. Not sure how you could redesign to avoid that. Still, I have fun with this almost every play.

Best hidden role game with lots of additional roles and rules. You can mix and match stuff to rebalance the game between rounds but the additional stuff is very hit and miss. It's mostly good though and it's easy to avoid the bad stuff by simply not using it.

I am a great fan of 'Avalon', as many will know, as it is a very simple but subtle conspiracy/hidden identity themed game which has loads of interaction and absolutely no downtime. You are either allied to Arthur, King of the Britons (the 1970's HTV TV series theme tune hums away in the background) or Mordred and Morgana, Arthur's illegitimate son and shadowy half sister, respectively. Five quests must be completed, and each turn, one player in clockwise order becomes King Arthur, with the responsibility of selecting his most 'faithful' knights to complete these quests successfully. There difficulty increases, as the preceding one is resolved, and King Arthur and his knights must chose wisely. Since each player has a hidden identity - they may be loyal or disloyal - players must try to analyse who is on their side. The servants of Mordred know who undermines the King with them, and if Merlin is played, he knows their identities, whereas they do not know his! Playing Merlin in 'Avalon' is a difficult call, as I rediscovered first time back, so Pete Myatt faced Hobson's (not Sophie's) Choice in the second game as had he not selected the perfect team, King Arthur would have lost his throne. Careless. Mordred and his supporters must be wary of both failing a quest, if selected at the same time, so always watch out for any comments that may give clues as to how players are looking to vote! Games can be made more interesting with the addition of other characters, such as Morgana and Mordred themselves, Oberon, Percival and the Assassin. In the basic game, only Merlin and the assassin are included. In the event that the loyal knights win, the servants of Mordred may try to guess the identity of Merlin, and if they are correct, they win. The assassin player chooses, ultimately, but may take advice from the other Mordred supporters, or not, as they see fit. Of the three minions of Mordred, only one, and not the assassin, would have pegged me for Merlin in the first game, but it was academic. Was I too enigmatic or too shadowy? That's the fun of it! I need to improve my observational skills as to other people's behaviours on voting. It was good to see, after many promptings by me, that 'Avalon' has returned and I will continue to promote its adoption more regularly.

Avalon was one of the first few games that I played when I got into this hobby. It was really fun for the first few times. I have played this game for almost all the player counts and with different groups of people and the meta-game remains the same and the discussions start to become repetitive after few games.  Although I have used this game successfully to hook people into this hobby. So this definitely serves as a good gateway game. But at this point I am more likely to sit out of this, and if I am forced to play a social deduction game, which is not my favorite genre, I would chose Secret Hitler over this.

Voting, information for determination played on cards in secret (anonymous revelation).
Bluffing/lying, deduction, more lying. Mostly lying.
Light weight mechanically, super heavy socially!
There's a theme? I thought it was 'trust no-one'.

The only reason you would not laugh your butt off playing this game is if you're either too confused (understandable) or too paralysed by indecision as to who to trust, so if that kind of thing hampers your enjoyment rather than amp it, it's a no-go. Also super introverts may not enjoy everyone else yelling and mucking about which is also perfectly understandable.

Some people just can't be mean and that's OK...
... but they tend to make the best spies. Just saying.

The specialized roles make this even better than The Resistance by putting extra pressure on at least one of the players. Since you don't have to play with them, though, this almost entirely replaces The Resistance unless you have a strong preference of the original's theme for some reason.

We never really liked the special abilities in The Resistance, preferring to just play it vanilla, so I was pretty wary going into Avalon.  Turns out, it's pretty much genius.  The core change is Merlin, which is just an incredibly subtle and well-designed role.  The tension is absolutely perfect--he knows, he wants to help the team win, but if he's obvious about it the team will lose.

There seems to be a bit less full-out arguing so far in this than in standard Resistance, since more people are in the know each round.  Then again, that could just be because we haven't found our groove yet. :)

Overall, huge thumbs up.

I really enjoyed the original The Resistance, and picked up this version due to the new roles. I much prefer this to games like "Werewolf"/"Mafia" due to the lack of player elimination. The new theme seems kinda weird and pasted-on to me, but others in my group really enjoy it, so mileage varies.

RATING: 6
I'm not that big of a fan of social deduction games so Avalon didn't impress me all that much. It's a neat party game, but I think that the rule allowing the bad guys to kill Merlin ruins the whole experience. It doesn't matter how clever the good guys were, it all comes down to that one final decision. You might as well roll a die to determine the winner. I've played only with the basic cards, maybe the game gets better after introducing more advanced characters.

This game is nearly identical to The Resistance with one major difference (other than the medieval skinning). There is a particular player on the resistance side (Merlin) who knows who the spy are. To balance out the advantage if Merlin is too obvious and the spies can determine who Merlin is the win even if the have not failed 3 missions. I personally like this twist my Adrienne would still prefer the original game.

Another werewolf/mafia type hidden role game, but this one does not need a moderator. In my opinion Merlin makes Avalon better than the Resistance base game as the challenge is not just on who is a spy, but who is Merlin (who knows who the evil team is but could get assassinated at the end thus making the good team lose) as well. Adds layers upon layers of possible misdirection.

This game has been dethroned as the best social deduction to me but it still has its moments

RATING: 3
If you like the theme of a traitor amongst your group in a game, I do NOT recommend Avalon.

This 'game' is not what I would consider a 'game'. It's just a deduction activity that I don't find very much fun in it(And I enjoy deduction games if done right). It's just deduce and find the traitor. When you play not everyone gets to do something because if people suspect you to be the bad guy, not let you join in on missions, you don't really get to contribute other than trying to convince the others to let you join.
Also you need to play with a good group of people or else this will turn into an unpleasant experience.

It's not like other games with traitor elements like Battlestar galactica where there's a main game to play through, but there's a traitor element that's a part of the game that can be in it if you want(Though highly recommended).

The only positives I can say for this 'game' is that it's fast, and a lot of players can play. But you could play this game with playing cards by having certain colors and suits dictate which good guy or bad guy you are.

So if you're like me, I don't recommend Resistance or any of it's variant.

It's a lot of fun to guess who's loyal and who's not.

The second best traitor game on the market (after Battlestar Galactica). Technically if you have all the expansions of The Resistance then Avalon is functionally the same game (except for the plot cards in base Resistance that we have never touched and never will). I prefer the theme of regular Resistance, but Avalon adds roles and mechanics that really spice up the game and allows for variety in how you mix and match the different roles, you can go base vanilla or go all out with all of the extra roles.

I got this after having played The Resistance for years with friends. I fell in love with this version instantly. I feel as though I can't go back to the old version now. The roles add such a depth to the game.

Wouldn't be my first choice of deduction game to play, but fun none the less.

What I like about this game is to watch people argue, I love this players conversations and interaction. My first approach to modern board games was with werewolf with 12 drunk people, a total laugh. It delivers a good fun for the simplistic mechanics and reduced time. It depends too much of the group and the willingness to talk with others ,and the creativity, other times people get confused about the quest, specially really non-gamers. Because of that I don't give a 10, so sometimes I get bored.

Help aid Arthur and Britain to greater good or help fell them as agents of evil for Mordred in the struggle of Avalon where players will deduce over the span of the game who is good and who is evil.

Not bad for a who-can-lie-the-best game.  But I'm not a big fan of those.

Go-to party game for more than 5, better than Resistance.

This game is definitely a way to stir the pot in your gaming group. The little twists it adds to the core game make it quite interesting. 
Though for some reason my gaming group is very good at deception.... good rarely wins.

This is my favorite game, and the game I play most often. It does have a bit of a learning curve, and new players may be a bit overwhelmed if playing with experienced opponents.  But if you learn the game's intricacies and conflicting objectives, your efforts will be rewarded.  Every character has their own goals and challenges to keep track of, even generic blue (base character) is a critical to their team's success.  The game play mechanics are quite simple, but don't confuse this with a simple game. The game's depth and complexity lies in the way all of the asymmetric information is distributed, shared, and used against the people who have it. The game is impecabally balanced with good outnumbering evil, but evil has more information and an easier time creating failures. The game plays well with any number of players from 5-10, but definitely changes and becomes more olcomplex with more players. I can't recommend this game enough.

Rare choice for large groups in my collection - Galactica's main source of enjoyment extracted and packed into party game. As Cosmic Encounter, highly dependent on the people playing it so it can become dull.

As with many party games I often feel that it could be sketched with pen and paper, no actual components needed, yet that is often the mark of the good design.

This is for now my favorite social party game.

Might change when I manage to play Captain Sonar.

After 1 Play: I like the theme of the original more, but some of the special characters seem fun, so it's a wash.

Played 3 games. The new starting mechanic works great and alleviates the Resistances problem of the first turn being a guess. The theme just seems to fall flat.

Another fun party game, I love it, love the traitor aspect, love the intrigue and deception. Great times with this game. Lancelot promo adds a lot to the mix, much fun.

RATING: 9
Another variation on Werewolf, but well done in that it gives nearly all players something interesting to do for the whole game. Plays quickly, ideal for multiple plays.

Favourite combination of special characters is probably Merlin, Assassin, Percival, Morgana, Mordred. Not a fan of Excalibur or Lady of the Lake; haven't tried Oberon/Lancelot enough to judge those two.

Enjoyment will depend largely on the group playing it; groups with a dominating player or players that don't like to talk bullshit and deception probably won't enjoy it as much. Also, if you get stuck in a groupthink/convention rut it might get stale (the meta-game changes with repeated play, or at least it should).

Top 5:
"party" or bigger (casual) group (4 < ) light game.

This game is tough to review. 
In it self it is actually a quite good game that we feel is balanced from 5 players all the way up to 10.
The problem here is that if you, like us, usually play with the same group of people then you will start to learn how to read them. This kinda breaks the game hence the low rating.
In the beginning it was quite nice, but now I'd rather leave it on the shelf unless it is with a group of people who have not played it before.

Finally got around to playing our copy. My wife likes it a lot, but at least in the one game I played it seemed to last much longer than it should have. I see it as a filler card game but rather than the 20-30 minutes I expected it lasted about double that. I'll give it a couple more tries before we decide whether or not to keep it.

Favourite of Annette and I when we go away. Small, easy to travel with. After a few plays, you get used to the power cards, and can sort them into the order you want, as in the rules. But for the first several plays, we just shuffled and drew them random, until we got used to the use and effect in the game. Good fun, but hard for me to beat Annette.

RATING: 9
I feel a bit odd rating such a simplistic game so high, especially after just a single game, but it's essentially for its simplicity and elegance I give the rating. Is it a 9 compared to Arkham Horror or Ra? No, but it's a 9 relative to other light, 2 player card games. 

Well worth the investment, especially if you're trying to coax a game-hesitant girlfriend or wife to have a go at your addiction. Not sure if it works as well on the opposite sex, but here is one guy that rather enjoyed it (for what it is). 

It's one of those games where the experience it helps creates overshadows the worth of the game play, but ultimately the experience wouldn't have come about under any other circumstance. 

*2011 update: Game was damaged and lost. Fun title. May repurchase one day.

Caesar & Cleo is a decent game of hand management, with a touch of bluff and a fair bit of take-thatery.  The two players vie for control of five Roman factions and there are bonuses for higher degrees of control. So there are decisions about which factions and how many you focus on, and the extent to which you can ignore one that your opponent is collecting. The variant rules that cut the number of orgy cards are a good idea, reducing the randomness and shortening the game somewhat.

I like the long, thin cards and the artwork is really good.

RATING: 7.5
This is a very good 2-player game that stickes to its historical setting quite well but is abstract enough that you can visualize a strategy without too much detail. Essentially this is a game of scoring tricks, but the assymetry of the groupings as well as the variables thrown in make for variety. The best player is the one who adapts best to randomness and who can minimize over-playing their hand.

2p only. Egyptian theme. Plays quickly, on your turn you can play an action card, and then must play either one card face down to influence patricians or plays two cards face up for the same purpose.
As all card games it is very luck driven. but a good game nontheless. The luck comes from drawing the influence cards and the orgy cards.

I don't quite get this game. The bluffing mechanic doesn't get much use since playing one card face down is disadvantageous to your opponent following with two cards face up. The battles for influence are straight forward, each side trying to outdo the other in all areas since usually a few of them can be called for a vote at any time. The action cards do add a good twist to the game, but I'm not sure its enough to hold my interest, compared to Lost Cities or Battleline (the best, IMHO). There doesn't seem to be more than one or two relevant decisions to make per turn, something is missing.

Picked this offering up specifically to play with my wife.  After our first outing I would say we both came away with a positive experience.  The action cards stirred things up a bit, and just when you thought you had the correct influence, the carpet was pulled out from underneath you.  It's definitely important to go for the majority of senators in each column.  That is what tipped the scale in my favor at the end, as the number of senators swayed by each of us was identical.  I look forward to playing again.  [Market price]

One of my least favorite of the Kosmos 2 player games. There just doesn't seem to be enough here. Not confrontational enough, not enough strategy to keep me interested.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
p: The strength of the early titles in the Kosmos 2-player range, and their obvious success, arguably tempted just about all game companies to fight for a slice of this hitherto ignored gamers market. As a happy result we now have many more, and maybe even better 2-player games, but when this game came out it was a long overdue addition and pretty high on the list of refreshingly new challenges for gamers with a partner less likely to engage in (card-)play.

The art and presentation is top notch, and goes a long way towards making an abstract numbers and majorities game very atmospheric. It seems that the gratuitous use of an exclamation mark after the word "Orgy" sits uncomfortable with a certain audience, but I fear the day when game companies will avoid all light-hearted use of thematically (and historically) correct flavourings because of these attitudes. Just think of the obvious alternative: a day at the circus!

The game hasn't quite matured well enough for my liking, but it still comes out at times and usually it helps me to remember it is better than I recalled. Time-constraints usually means we play with random action-card draw stacks, but there is a huge argument for letting players take a few moments to decide the order of these for themselves (as suggested). The timely use of action cards is very influential on game proceedings.

There are many subtle ways to play this one, and it's amazing how many different dilemmas you can pose your opponent by adding just one or two cards to the influence stacks. Facing hidden information can be unnerving, so opting to play just a single influence card face-down can be a powerful way to make your opponent reconsider his options, and influence the direction of play. If you enjoy your bluffs than this alone can be good clean fun.

Since both players have identical cards it will not come as a surprise that games tend to be tight. However, since 
the overall influence that players have in play, is most likely to be in their favour right after they had their turn, drawing a long sequence of orgy-cards will seriously hamper their chances of winning, as they won't be turning this advantage into victory points. Over the course of a game this should become a more evenly balanced occurrence, but it doesn't always pan out that way, making those games a more frustrating experience than it ought to be.

Those times are widely outnumbered by some pretty intense and close-fought battles, and the lady doesn't always get her way. But it appears to be the sort of game that is seductive enough to make her willing to try.

Good game and Excellent artwork; I always play it with the following variant: in your turn you have one of the following 3 options: a) play 2 face up cards and 1 action card b) play 1 face up, 1 face down and no action card c) play 1 face down and 1 action card; a bit convoluted but much better

RATING: 2
Very disappointing 2 player game.  We just found it dull.  The theme was also pretty yawnarific too... senators... yawn.  whatever.  

Reminds me a little of Star Wars 4 when they do all of that terrifically boring stuff involving the "galactic senate" (and they ruin whatsyamacalees beautiful hair by making it all big and poofy).   Yeah, whatever Lucas.  Wake me up when the show's over.  Oh and what the hell was with Jar Jar Binks.  What a lame piece of crap that was.. AND MEDICHLORINES?   Duh..

RATING: 4
I'm just not at all a fan of the system used here.  Players add influence on various counsels, and the timing of when the counsels score is random.  So, you end up in a back and forth battle where the scoring is determined by who is lucky enough to be in the lead when a counsel scores.  To top it off, there are some cards that make the loser win, making it a total crap shoot since cards can be played face down.

This is another in the line of two player Kosmos games that hasn't seen as much action as some of the others.  This isn't to say it's not fun, but I think "Blue Moon" for a shorter game and "Starship Catan" for a longer game are better places to start.

I would like it more if it took itself more seriously. The box looks like a serious fight for political control, with names of perhaps real roman senators being brandied about. Instead we get Biggus Dickus and other such nonsense, with serious looking pictures, having to leave the form to go to an orgy. Why? I like family friendly games, that I can play with my 11 yr old little sister when I see her, and this unfortunately ISN'T one of them.

What starts out as a pretty little game with gorgeous artwork set in Roman times, added to by numerous tiny word jokes and humorous actions with tie in with the subject matter very well (the orgy being the best of those) devolves quickly into a rather dull and hard-to-control majority game for 2. The game works, no doubt about it, but it has too many rough spots for me to keep on playing it. For one thing, the influence mechanic is pretty dull since in about 80% of the cases you know the value of the cards laid at either end of the public officials. That makes placing cards face down a bit of a showstopper: there's not enough time for the opponent to start biting his nails. Then there is also the rather crude mechanic deciding which part of public Rome is 'questioned', which can see some wild and silly swings in influence beyond the players' control. You may secure an official one turn, draw an orgy, then see your opponent add support next, and walk away with the official because the correct group was questioned. Not much fun. Finally, the scoring doesn't make much of an impact as competent players will see to it that the majorities even out, making the game pretty much a zero sum-one. You'd be forgiven for thinking this was an Ornella game in which many different sources of points add up to something equal just the same.

All in all, too much much ado about nothing, and too few interesting choices to make. It's a shame because obviously there has been tremendous effort in making the game look good... But the spirit of the material is not able to cover up the meager achievements of the core game. That's a crying shame, but really, once was enough for me.

RATING: 4
I feel this game is kind of similar to Battle Line.  Though I consider it to be in many ways inferior.  Orgies come up way too often and even if you use the variant that has only the one Orgy card you never can tell which faction will be the one to be fought over for the round.  This means that whatever cards you decide to lay down may not help you when it's needed.  The passive action also seems relatively useless in my experience.  Maybe it would be better after repeated plays but I would just rather play Battle Line.

We use a DIY version I created on PPT. (Now on BGG files).  We are starting to LOVE this game!!  Plays quickly and is lots of fun.  Bluffing, strategy, choices.  We play very few action cards as we enjoy the straight battle elements of the game, but are exploring the actions more each time.  

UPDATE:  Haven't played in a long time and we aren't really interested in playing again.  Our tastes have changed since learning different types of games.  I am lowering the rating to reflect this.

Caesar & Cleopatra is a simple bluffing card game for two. The duelling rulers place followers in order to draw influential Roman senators over to their sides. Whenever one of the frequent scoring rounds comes along the current majority holder can add one senator to their supporters. The game is perfectly symmetrical in theory, and while bad card draws can be a huge setback they usually even out pretty well over the course of a play. The excessive amount of reshuffling required can be somewhat annoying.

Caesar and Cleopatra is a political influence game for two, played with cards.  Primarily a game of bluffing and strategy with card draws adding an element of luck. The latter of which causes players to hedge their bets and try to buy time by using action cards to either weaken their opponent or strengthen their own position.  The action cards are what really give Caesar and Cleopatra life, otherwise this little game would simply be about playing the odds and stacking numbers.  I don't feel as some do that there are a lot of strategic choices, as they are more often than not limited by your hand (making the game somewhat more tactical). I find the hidden agendas to be short lived, as one can not allow control of their needed senators to go uncontested too long before action is necessary.  The replayability of Caesar and Cleopatra for me is limited as I find most games resolving themselves similarly.  Caesar and Cleopatra is far from being a bad game, but neither is it a game I rush to play.

Update:  I reverse my thinking on a statement i made earlier about this not being a bad game, it is.  I find no real opportunities here to do anything interesting. Down to 3.

RATING: 6
There are either too many orgy cards, or else not enough ways to force a vote. All too frequently the player who is the luckiest (plays a card on a patrician pile that gives them advantage only to flip over a vote for that exact pile immediately afterwards) wins the day, which is really not fun. Also, if you are so unfortunate as to tie in this game, the tie-breaker is really unsatisfying, and a tie really is not that uncommon in this game. Finally, the theme is just suggestive of a company trying to "sex up" a fairly dry, abstract game, and because of this is becomes unsuitable to kids, which is actually an audience that might be appropriate for the game! Really unfortunate.

One of my favorite Kosmos two-player games, although not many people agree with me.  I don't think of it as being about out-guessing your opponent.  I think about playing the odds -- usually there is no guesswork involved, and you can cover almost all of your bases.  All tactical, no long-term strategy necessary, but that's fine with me.  And the cards are beautifully done, with great flavor.

The card art is terrific, but I've never understood the enthusiasm over this one.  (The middling BGG rating isn't reflective of the rave reviews at the time of its release.)  Several years have now passed since its release, and I've got to lower my rating even further.  I have no brilliant analysis to offer; the game simply bores me.  There's no reason to bring it to the table with the wealth of better quick two-player games available these days.

Nice bluffing and bidding game, with good player interaction. I like that players have identical (except for the artwork) individual decks, which reduce luck of the draw. It still happens, especially in the voting cards and at the beginning of the game, but you just have to be ready for everything and keep track of which cards are still in the (very small) voting deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Interesting two player game.  There is some amount of trying to get into your opponents head that always makes for an enjoyable affair.  The randomness and luck of the vote card removes certainty and adds a lot to the game.  You never know which faction is going to come up.  Not for those that don't like luck.  Doesn't make it to the table that often, but when it does I always have a good time and the games are very close.

The first game of the Kosmos 2-player series I played and I loved it. Nowadays I like it, but don´t love it anymore.

However, it´s a great game and gets even better once you know the game and play with an prepared deck of cards. The bluffing element isn´t big, as you have the option to play 2 cards face up, instead of one card face down. You can also expose the cards with action cards.

This game is a lot deeper than it looks.  The combination of bluffing, counter bluffing, and hand/deck management is really good.  There is a lot of interaction, but you don't feel like you are punching each other in the gut all game.  

Components are great, the theme is fun, and the cards have some humor to them.  The vote of confidence card draws and the luck there can be a little obnoxious early on but later when you can force conflict yourself things even out.  Well balanced and fun game.  Perfect for an airplane or car as there are no dice or bits- everything is cards.  Nice couples game, very deep for a two player card game due to the bluffing.

Long and somewhat tedious. Play a card or cards and then hope that the random scoring that is triggered is in your favor. Make plans for three turns, then your opponent plays a single card and happens to get the right scoring card. Make an unhappy face. Rinse and repeat. Oh, and I don't like the graphics much. The patricians categories are written much too small, which makes the game uncomfortable to play for me. And the Vertrauensfrage cards are easily shuffled wrongly, as they look nearly the same from both sides.

RATING: 8
Thrift store find. This game is good but its only 2 players.  Each player has the exact same 2 decks of cards which are used to earn the 'vote of confidence' from the various factions.  The player at the end of the game with the most factions wins.  What I really like about this game, and is somewhat unique, is that once cards are played and discarded, they are out of the game.  There is no reshuffle and no playable card that lets search graveyards or otherwise bring these cards back into your hand.  One of the ways the game is over, is when no cards are left to play.  The game is also unique in that it allows you to set up one of the decks (the action deck) any way you choose.  I certainly think this is for more experienced players.  when refilling your hand with 1-3 cards, you can take any amount of cards from either this pre-arranged deck of action cards or the influence cards.  The one thing we were not big fans of, are the 'bonus goal' cards each player gets at the beginning.  It's quite probable that both players can have the same goal of capturing the most of one group.  This might add flare as we play more so I'll retain faith in the designer's choice to do this till I've played a few more rounds.  
All in all, the game is simple, and after three or four turns you will have the process of play figured out.  The cards are nice, if not a bit odd shaped,   The art is attractive and fits the game mood.  I am bored of cartoony card game art.  I think this game would REALLY benefit from a 4 player option.

Another good Kosmos 2 player game.  My wife likes games light and fast so we play with the option of playing with shuffled action decks as opposed to prestacked decks.  Gameplay is fast (after we stumbled through our first game using a translation sheet because we picked up the German printing) with most turns presenting interesting choices.

IMHO, the best (so far) of the 2 player Kosmos games.  It is tense and relatively fast moving.  It is a _bit_ susceptible to the luck of the cards you draw, but over the course of the game, this tends to even out since each player has an identical deck to draw from.

After two games, my wife and I find this to be a fun and engaging affair.  The decision of whether to place cards right side up or upside down is excellent, and, while mathy, the game does not feel overly so.  I would choose this over Lost Cities, personally.  Plus, I prefer the theme here, even if it is mostly pasted on.

A fairly quick tug-of-war style game. I like the hidden/visible aspect a lot. It makes for some tough choices when deciding what to do. However, the Voting cards were much too random for me. I would've preferred a more consistent way to vote.

Artwork was good, and the tarot-sized cards were a nice touch. Overall, its a simple and portable 2 player game just a touch more complicated than Lost Cities or Balloon Cup.

A good 2-player game that plays quite smoothly. There's quite a lot of luck included, but it probably never ruins anyone's game completely and is a nice balancing act to the level of secrecy included. My main concern are the orgy cards. There're maybe too many of them. 5 orgies in a row stalls the game badly and if you're the player drawing most of the orgies, then, that's bad luck. Also, the player going first always has a minor advantage that fades too slowly.

This is an average two player card game.  There are some interesting elements (action cards) but the randomness of the the voting was frustrating.  I can handle randomness in games, especially in card games, but when all your card playing is geared towards the voting which you have absolutely no control over, that is not enjoyable.  Unfortunately, I couldn't think of a variant to fix this.

Az egész nagyon tetszene... Sőt, imádnám! De valahogy nagyon furcsa helyzetekbe csöppenek ezzel a játékkal kapcsolatban. Úgy érzem, hogy olyan pechsorozatokban találom magam, ami igazán frusztrál. Nem kérdés, az egész nagyon véletlenszerű. A pakliból felhúzott lapok sorrendje, a célkártya. Egyedül az akciókártyákat lehet berendezni és igazán jó ötlet. Viszont a kiértékelések ilyen szintű véletlenszerűsége fáj eléggé. Ha olyan helyzetbe kerül az ember, hogy többször egymás után (nekem 4-es sorozatom volt) orgiát húz, akkor hiába pozicionálja magát jól a körében, az ellenfél jó eséllyel értékelést húz.

Amúgy az egész iszonyatosan hangulatos. Igen-igen, ez egy absztrakt játék, de jók az illusztrációk, viccesek a "karakterek" nevei és úgy az egész. De jó lenne erre az értékelésre valami jó megoldást találni...

Maybe the 1st Eurogame we owned (or maybe Lost Cities was 1st), at a time when we played games like Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble. In the end, it was Lost Cities (and, to a lesser extent, Guillotine) that grabbed our attention, never this. In theory, this seems like a good game. But I never have fun playing it. How many times do you have to turn up the "Orgy" card and have no vote take place? Too much spinning of wheels- we traded this one for Scarab Lords.

I must be missing something fantastic for people to give this such a high review score... Also 60 minutes is a bit long: I can't remember any game taking more than 25 minutes.

well... i bought the german version in 1998 or something, You have to give them some credit, because in the bad old days board/card gaming was very experimental and new - there was only stratego, risk or monopoly out there.

Played about 10 times, decided it was lame, gave it away, then totally forgot about it. 
Gave it away because EVERY SINGLE TIME you draw this Bitte mischen (shuffle) card and it's very silly to shuffle a deck of 4 cards where there are 3 cards in it called bitte mischen.
Ok so you have a veto card to forbid counting, and the fool, but the game mechanics are too superficial. After about 10 times you see through that, and what remains is nice artwork.

the building up of forces is done better in babel, and the fool effect (philosopher) is done better in Wizard, 2 superior card games. Wizard even supports 6 players.

Once you got and played babel and wizard to death I'd suggest pick up this game and it might work for you and your partner, it won't cost more than about 5 euro nowadays.

Decent little 2 player card game in the Kosmos two player line.  One person plays Cleopatra, the other plays Caesar as you play influence cards and possibly action cards which effect the influence each side has on five different types of Roman nobles.  You gain points by winning more of one type of ruling class than your opponent, bonus point if all of that class supports you, and 2 bonus points if you can complete control of your secret objective as well as scoring one point for every noble card you have in your court.  

Just a note of warning for family gamers - there are so called "orgy" cards which prevents voting from occurring on someone's turn...:-)

Not a fan of the orgy card personally...and I'd prefer other games in the Kosmos two player game so this one was sold in the Lydia charity auction.

This is a good two player game that feels similar to Battle Line in some respects (playing number cards to win a row, using action cards to shift things in your favor) but has enough differences to make it an interesting game in its own right.  A slight complaint is the small vote deck.  The constant reshuffling is a pain and the cards are handled so often I'm sure they will show wear quickly.  I guess adding two or three cards of each type would throw off the balance by allowing people to draw the same card type on successive turns but it seems there should be a more elegant solution.

Two great powers who rule the ancient world -- the Roman Empire and the Egyptian Kingdom.  A higher than expectation Eurogame on a great subject with political intrigues and manuovers.  Cleopartra and Mark Anthony, Caesar and Caesarian...The Nile River, will rise and fall again...The game is very fun, exciting and true to the time of intrigue politics, where hidden influences in different governmental bodies of the Roman Empire are exercised by both parties.  Some nice simple game mechanics in here to simulate the complex interactions between 2 players, with the special action cards at hand to turn over the table sometimes.

After a first play I really like this game despite the fact that I got my butt kicked. Anticipation is important, the luck factor is average, I love it.

The only bad thing about the game are the ugly influence cards of Caesar, maybe it's ment that way but I don't like playing with cards that almost disgust me. They could have at least given them a nice color, but the white and gray makes everything depressingly worse. I can never imagine someone volunteering to play with Caesar ...

I remembered this as a pretty fun 2 player game, but when I sat down to play it again recently, I got that 'hey this is pretty clever' feeling. We are still yet to play the more advanced planned version which I think should be very interesting but even with a random draw, the games are always tense and engaging. The end game is difficult to judge too - I tend to play very agressively, playing a lot of cards (a CCGer trait) but have on occasion then been stuck with nothing to do but watch as my more conservative opponent wipes up the last senators.

Despite some positive comments, the reviews seem to suggest that the game starts of enjoyable, but dulls after repeated plays.

In the years since its release apparently a number of more enjoyable similar mechanic games have overtaken C&C in terms of ratings.

One of the old Kosmos 2 player game. This game plays a bit similar to one of my favourite 2 player game, Omen. I think actually Omen is a better themed game and more polished, but with less replayability and strategy if not with the expansion and drafting rules. In the contrary, Caesar and Cleopatra feels like a classic euro: mathy, weak theme, good mix of luck and strategy. Excellent choice as a game to play with non-gamer partner.

Bad start because of a mistake in the italian rules found inside the game: they say you can place one or two cards covered, while the right translation is "either one covered card or 2 OPEN cards". But here at BGG I found   italian right translation with a lot of explanations missing in the rules in the box! The game, at the start, is not easy to understand and it takes a while to grasp when to use the action cards (the italian edition translated as manipulation...). After 5 mathces under the belt, I start using properly some action cards and to place the influence the cards in a much rewarding way. Such a game deserves more explanations and examples of play. I think it could be more popular in my country (Italy) if the rules would be properly translated and full of examples of paly.

Die Spieler besitzen identische Kartensätze, die sie teilweise auf die Hand nehmen, und teilweise als Reservestapel vor sich legen. 
Wer an der Reihe ist, kann aktiv werden oder passiv bleiben. Passiv bleiben wählt man nur, wenn man keine vernünftigen Karten auf der Hand hat. Üblicherweise wird man aktiv und führt einen Zug mit 4 Phasen aus. 
Zum Abschluss des Spielzuges wird eine Karte der Vertrauensfrage aufgedeckt. Sie zeigt üblicherweise eine Patriziergruppe. An dieser Gruppe werden alle verdeckt liegenden Einflusskarten aufgedeckt. Wer nun mehr Einflusspunkte aufweist, gewinnt eine Patrizierkarte und somit eine Stimme für sich.

Initial review after one play. I really enjoyed this game. The dynamics are interesting, with the way the cards turn over when the vote of confidence comes, but then they are partially discarded. The action cards really spice things up and, with the exception of the Spy card (I hate cards that let my opponent look at my hand), they are fun to play and can be played very strategically. With some more play, I'm sure that establishing their initial order will be an art. Finally, the Philosopher cards are a fun twist, reversing the order of scoring for one round. My wife literally screamed in frustration in our first game (not usually a good sign), but wants to play again anyway - a very good sign.

My wife and I play with the variant where you can play 2 face-down without an action card which helps the game alot.  It's a fun, quick card game. There's just enough chance, hidden values, twists (action cards and the Philosopher cards) to keep you guessing.  One of the funniest things was when I had 4 cards face down - 3 1's and a Philosopher which I had rearranged that way with a Castling action card, and my wife had placed 5's face down against it.  Should've seen her face.

I think in the future though we'll play with the variant in which you remove orgy cards as more and more groups run out.

RATING: 7
There is a small smattering of bluff, counter bluff.  Various event cards can occasionally wreak havoc on well laid plans.  The draw order for the votes of confidence can certainly affect the game early on.  Despite this annoying lack of control (which is probably something I secretly like), the game is a good two-player tug of war.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very good two player card game. It's essentially an area control game with little direct conflict. That's a good thing for me because my wife tends to not like direct conflict between players. She seems to tolerate the 'Assassinate' and the 'Spy' cards which are as bad as it gets for this game in terms of player conflict. Another thing is that the game seems to be very finely balanced. Many of our games end in ties and the rest are very close. I think this is an outcome of the mechanic which causes you to lose your strongest card when you win a vote of confidence. My one concern is of the long term replayability of the game, there doesn’t seem to be very many different ways of approaching it. I recommend this game; if you liked Odin’s Ravens you’ll like this. But if you don’t own either try Odin’s Ravens first.

This game has a sound concept and plays as a fairly straightforward card game. Unfortunately, the theme really doesn't do it for me and I'd rather play any of my other games instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nicely done card game. The cards are beautiful and the the theme actually fits quite nicely for a card game. While the strategy for this game is a little bit limited (just bid higher than your opponent) being able to hide some bids and using action cards make this more fun and a bit more strategic than first glance. While this really is a fun auction card game and a bit deeper than other auction games, like For Sale, it is still a bit limited by the luck of the draw. I would happily play again!

07/10/03 Received. A goodly amount of nastiness, which I like. The artwork (something I seldom note) is wonderful. Going so far as to make the background of the influence and patrician cards types all line up into one complete image. Plus some of the names of the patricians are quite amusing (my favorite is Lustus Frustus). The biggest laugh is unintentional. The No Vote card that is instructs one to reshuffle the cards has the syllables separated in the wrong place, saying "Res-huffle". After seeing that I can't help but pronounce it that way!
As of 08/13/17 I've played 27 games, winning 20 (74.1%).

A pretty good game that needs a few tweaks.  Without some tweak, players find themselves always opting to play two cards face up and the end game can get random.  With a few tweaks, this is an excellent game.

RATING: 8.5
Reminds me a bit of Battle Line because both players are putting down their influence cards in order to get cards (patricians) from the middle of the table.
It's more dynamic and tactical than Battle Line because almost each turn voting happens and one of the middle (patrician) cards is won by the player with the most influence at that moment so you have to have your influences wisely spread all the time among the 5 groups of patricians to maximize your chance of winning them.
Action cards are great and add additional layers of strategy. There is even a "mission" card, your secret goal (as to which patrician group to win) which gives additional points at the end. 
I like this game better than Battle Line and think it should be rated much higher. It is more complex and gives many more opportunities for skillful play.

I don't like this one, there's too many orgies. You have to shuffle the cards (which are difficult to shuffle) every two minutes or so! Annoying. I guess I could try it again, but I'm not easily convinced.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well-produced two-player strategy game with attractive,  amusing cards and a neatly applied Roman theme. Unfortunately it also has a couple design imbalances (regarding face-up vs. face-down card play and frequency of orgies) which can't easily be fixed despite several noble efforts here. Bummer. [8 plays; gave away]

RATING: 8.5
This game is incredible for the fact that it's deep bidding strategy. You'll find new strategies for bidding on the senators every time you play a new person.

I also love the fact that the game is only somewhat random: although your influence cards themselves are drawn randomly (although you start with a full set in your hand) you set the order that you will draw your action cards right up front. This allows you to set up a game-length strategy before you've even drawn your first card...and it actually works out in play!

C&C is easy to play and you can get new players going relatively easily. The only ding I'd give the game is that although the light, easy rules are simple for someone to play with there's still a learning curve that will take you 30 minutes to get through; that's about half the time you'll spend playing.

In it's favor, C&C really will play in an hour or less, even on your first game. It's lots of fun, there's plenty of bidding, bluffing and strategy and is a great light game perfect for sharing with that non-gamer gf/wife.

Interesting "area control" kind of card game. One minor flaw is the vote of confidence deck. I know it's easy to make everything cards, but those cards are difficult to shuffle and need to be shuffled so often. One thing I've wanted to do for a while is create tiles to replace these...that way you just put all the tiles back on an "orgy".

Our Rating Guide (1 = Disappointed, 3= Hit & Miss, 5= Owned it!)

1. Originality: 4 - The theme wins points for being original, and when I got this it was pretty unique but now I think they have several versions of this game with different themes.

2. Artwork: 4 - Great artwork.  

3. Quality of Contents: 4 - It's all just cards. They seem to hold up well to shuffling. 

4. Storyline: 3 - I appreciate the theme, but the game itself doesn't tell much of a story so it makes little difference if you even know who Caesar and Cleopatra are.

5. Playthrough: 3 - It's pretty simple and fun for a quieter game. 

6. Instructions: 4 - pretty straight-forward, but it's also a simple game. 

7. Replayability: 3 - Quick and easy for 2 players. It feels like a card game (as in standard 52 deck of playing cards for Crazy 8's or Go Fish) so it can get a bit tedious. I guess a better comparison would be "Uno". Some people can play that 10 times a day every day every week. Others need variety. I need variety.	

8. Two player: It only works as a two player game.

9. Large Group: N/A

10. Fun Factor: my rating: 3.5. As I said above, it's two-player Uno with a neat theme and pretty artwork.

Pleasant tactical game that generally leaves a good taste and is not too heavy for a revanche, since it doesn't overwhelm with many choices. 

The game itself is not too complex, but indeed quite complete: the random element (drawing cards) and the bluffing are well controlled, the action and philosopher cards bring several twists into the gameplay and the different bonuses allow some planning in longer term. 

Last but not least, it has a perfect plot to have it played at a date (a bit like in The Affair of Thomas Crown's chess scene). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A gem in many ways. Great psychology and double-bluff; played often enough, any alleged rules imbalance regarding the Action cards disappears totally. Downgraded twice because runaway leader syndrome does occasionally rear its head, due to randomness in the Vote Of Confidence pack, rather than anything to do with the player actions.

RATING: 6
Very clever, in that it takes a while to play out, involves lots of potential decisions, but is not complicated. My rating is 6 because the Orgy/Reshuffle card seems to come up too often and therefore slows play toward a more clunky pace. So, it doesn't seem as dynamic when compared to some other, later Kosmos 2-player games, but at the same time after my sister and I played it, we agreed that familiarity with what cards can do would probably reveal greater depth in this game, and consequently the rating would go up. 

Also, there are variant rules for lessening the effect of "Orgy" cards (when no "elections" take place) or removing Patrician cards whose piles have been depleted. These variants do help move play along. Personally, I took out one "Orgy" card before starting, and when the 'Reshuffle' card came up I did a 50/50 die roll to determine whether it was just a regular 'orgy' card or a reshuffle. 

Acquired by trade, November 2010. Sold, December 2011.

Based on one play: A simple game of playing point cards against different cards on the table so that when the scoring of the table cards comes up, you have the most points and then you get that card. But which table card will score is fairly random so if you play to get the most points on your side and then it does not score, it is wasted. Cute, but a little too much random timing in the scoring for me and there are better games in the genre.

TRY Dec/04: Enjoyable, with some feel of 'battles'. I'm disappointed that they had to have "orgy" cards, rather than something like "senate in session; no vote".  Also, the card shape is awkward for shuffling.

Still, quick game with nice strategy to it.  Somewhat like Schotten-Totten, with multiple battles going on.

A fun quick direct two player game.  It plays similar to Battle Line, however lighter and quicker.  I like the playing down to try to keep opponent guessing.  Scoring is typically competitive.

It seems some votes come up too quickly in the game.  The removing of cards can cause some wild swings, too.  It could be a little more deeper.

I played a ton of this with my wife when we were dating and first married. I learned about the game from Stefan O'Sullivan's website, before the days of BGG. I highly recommend SOS's house rule: When the third type of Patrician is gone from the table, remove one of the Orgy cards from the deck (but not the reshuffle one). Likewise, when the fourth Patrician stack is emptied, remove one more Orgy card (but not the reshuffle one).

Great game, unbelievable art.  An amazing, caught-on-a-desert-island game for 2.  Enough interesting action card usage to aid strategy but fun doesn't wane with the familiarity of replay.  For the sake of speed, I recommend tossing an ORGY CARD out after two (or three) of the senate groups are completely taken.  the orgy cards do add just the right dash of luck to the play.

I like the decisions to be made in this game.  While not one that I always clamor to get to the table, I usually enjoy it when I do.  The fact that I never really had a desire to pull it off the shelf eventually lead me to trade it away.

Feels like Lost Cities 2.0. Despite simple rules, the gameplay is engaging, especially the elements of bluffing.

Action cards, the philosopher cards, and mission cards all make this a well-rounded 2p game that should have great replayability.

I like this game, but I really need to be in the mood to play it.  There is A LOT of complexity through card play.  It is well-designed, but for a two-player card game it is a bit clunky.  My wife and I always seem to forget to pull the last card that calls for a "vote of confidence."  There are up to about 4 different types of card interaction per player round (which is nice sometimes), but that beefs the game up considerably.  I like the theme, though.

A card based bluffing game - the key is to focus on winning the majority in your "special influence" card and in the 3 card patrician classes.

Like many 2 player games, if the players are uneven in their skill levels, it will be quite unbalanced...

A simple game that's a really good introduction to the Kosmos two player gamer. I've played this one more than a hundred times and as a game light on the strategy and thinking it was pleasant enough. I've moved on since, but the game should still be a good gateway game and more rewarding than the more lauded Lost Cities. There's a lot of reading your opponent and making educated guesses, so the player interaction is quite decent with this one. If you're looking for a little more control then remove one of the orgy cards to reduce the deck shuffling.

This is a cute two player influence game. There are five politicians, each composed of 3 or 5 cards. Players put influence cards either secretly or openly (allowing them to place more) onto the politicians, fighting to get the next politician card. A random politician is picked for a vote, so you have little clue where you need to shore up support. Points are awarded per politician card, for having the majority of cards for any politician, for having a monopoly for any politician, and for getting the majority on the politician that matches your secret influence bonus card. Action cards allow you to change the rules, and the Philosopher card flip flops the influence rules so that the higher influence loses that match up. It plays out sort of like Balloon Cup or Schotten Totten; you can only play on your side, but action cards do a respectable job of mucking with your opponent. In all it's cute, there's some bluffing which I enjoy, and a healthy bit of luck. A few cards say "no vote, orgy today!" which apparently has a few folks up in arms. It's not like it comes with a matching illustration so this is much ado about nothing.

Good 2 player game.  There's still a fairly healthy dose of luck, but good tough choices to be made.  A bit of Balloon Cup (both players competing for a 'prize' by adding cards of different influence values on their side), a bit of Battle Line with the 'Action Cards' and being able to choose which pile to draw from, needing to watch that you don't give away an advantage, a bit of bluff, a bit of lots of little things which make a neat little game.  The wife couldn't stand it though so traded away.

The good part: there's bluffing, there's take that and it's very much in your face. 
The bad part: sometimes it's cruel and just plain random. What's with the orgies? And then there are situations you just can't get yourself out of, though you feel like you should be able to. 

I think it's the randomness which makes it a bit more mean that it is. At least it's a motivation for me to try Battle Line finally. 

EDIT: meh. no need to play this again

Caesar & Cleopatra is a confrontational cardgame with bluffing and take-that elements that spice up a rather dry theme. I like this adversarial game that does not get too serious and ends in about 20 minutes. Worth it'smoney and time!

RATING: 9
[6 plays] Too be simplistic, this can be described as Battle Line on crack - and I mean that in a good way.

What I like: artwork is really nice, the theme works, decent learning curve, the mechanics are very interesting - especially to those familiar with Lost Cities or Battle Line, occasional brain burning decisions, fun mechanics with the action and influence cards, and a mix of memory skills and good decisions should be more important than luck of the cards most of the time.

What I don't like: Although I got used to the oddly shaped cards, I'm not convinced more standard cards wouldn't be better.

What people need to know: Complete undertanding of a couple of rules, like removing patrician group cards from the vote of confidence deck once their supply is exhausted, has improved the speed of the endgame.

I find this to be a whole lot of the type of fun I look for in a game.

Most recent play 3-11-07 with Garrett.

I remembered this as a pretty fun 2 player game, but when I sat down to play it again recently, I got that 'hey this is pretty clever' feeling.  We are still yet to play the more advanced planned version which I think should be very interesting but even with a random draw, the games are always tense and engaging.  The end game is difficult to judge too - I tend to play very agressively, playing a lot of cards (a CCGer trait) but have on occasion then been stuck with nothing to do but watch as my more conservative opponent wipes up the last senators.

Caesar and Cleopatra is a solid two player game, oddly reminiscent of Battle Line (action cards = tactics cards, patrician cards = flags), although it is more fiddly than Battle Line and generally not as good. The players take turns playing action cards (like the tactics cards of Battle Line, they tend to do nasty things which make it difficult for one's opponent to win the cards under contention) and influence cards. Influence cards are simply numbered cards which are played on the patrician cards, with the top card typically being won by whomever has the greatest sum of influence cards. I think the theme is well done here, and am mature enough and educated enough to understand that sometimes, well, there isn't any politcal activity because there's an ORGY instead! Like many of the ancient Greeks, the Romans were fascinated with mystery cults, and orgies were certainly an aspect of worship/indoctrination. Every turn in the game, you flip a card from a deck revealing either a vote of confidence from one of the patrician types, or a card which says "orgy today: no vote". It's a slightly humorous, as well as historical touch, and there isn't any tasteless card art or anything. Kudos also to some of the Roman names, such as Oculus Myopus, and so on. They're a hoot. When it comes down to it, though, Hera and Zeus is a much better game for my money. I like the multiple routes to victory, and the psychological dimensions of that game do not feel contrived as they do here. Alternately, I would play Battle Line in the game "space". Caesar and Cleopatra is one of the better titles in the Kosmos two player line, however, and it might be the thing for you if games like Battle Line, Hera and Zeus, or LotR: tC aren't scratching your two-player itch.

A slightly above average "area" control card game for two. Can sometimes provide the opportunity for mind games. 

While the deck of the area-winning Influence cards is randomized, players can stack their deck of Special Action cards at the start of the game - a nice touch which allows for some strategy in an otherwise mostly tactical game.

A weakness is that out of the eight cards in the vote deck, three result in "No contest". As areas become completely controlled (and their cards removed from the vote deck), the ratio rises. This results far too often in the disappointment of a player's carefully planned round amounting to nothing. I prefer playing with two of these cards instead of three.

It's a fun enough two player bluffing game.  It is nicely designed and mostly works well, but I have some issues with the reshuffle orgy card mixed with the secret points card.  If the reshuffle keeps coming up before you get to score your secret objective, you end up wasting the game defending something that just never gets scored giving away your secret.  It seems the game would work better if the third orgy card gets flipped (or even the second), then you reshuffle. Otherwise, you should toss the secret cards out of the game.

This reshuffle method should speed the game up a bit more as well.  Often we found ourself spending a small but significant amount of time shuffling and reshuffling that deck.  It just gets annoying after a while.

I tend to like Franz Vohwinkel landscape art quite a bit, but his faces always look misshapen and tumorous.   He did a lot of art here, so there are a ton of tumors included.  

I do like the names of the patricians, very cute.

Its an "okay" sort of game. No highs or lows here, just kind of dry and blandish. It's fun trying to figure out what card your partner is going to play, but that can last only so long.

Not a bad two-player game. There definitely a timing element here in when to be aggressive and pick something up and what will be left behind afterwards. Still, not anything that I can see wanting to play a whole bunch, as the decisions don't seem to really grip me.

Just never really grabbed me the way I thought it would. One of those games that I&#039;m unclear as to why I don&#039;t like it more. Maybe if two players know the strategies well enough it comes down to luck of the draw?  That&#039;s probably an unfair criticism, but it seems too random to me.  Still, a light, fun game that plays out pretty quickly.  My two year-old tossed some cards out the car window, so I no longer own the game...

Another card game.  Another pasted-on theme.  Another somewhat mathematical exercise.  All right, so I'm a little biased against card games.  But I'll admit there is some fun involved in the bluffing aspect of the game and the tension of going head-to-head with another player, both of whom have a limited hand of cards.  Perhaps they could add some sort of racing aspect to this game, a tile-laying mechanic, as well as a large plastic palace and call it "Ave Caesar and Cleopatra and the Society of Architekton".  Okay, now I'm just being silly.  Game design: 2.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 4.5/10

This one gets a huge vote of confidence from me. 

This two player card game,  which sports some stunning artwork,  is an enticing mix of wits, luck and bluff. It is often a closely contested battle,  that is very prone to repeat plays.

The most common criticism is that there can be a first player advantage.  Concerning this,  I partially agree.  But.  for me,  this is an easy fix.  Since I would normally play this more than once anyway,  I just combine the score of two games with each player given the chance to go first.

I HATED this game UNTIL my husband and I started using the suggested rule variant where one could play two face-down cards and not play an action card.  Before this, we always would play face-up cards, otherwise the other would always be behind.  It is probably just our personal strategy and not a broken game - we both would try to get as many numbers out as possible and the only way to do that is face up.  Now that we use the new rule variant, strategy finally comes back into play.  I now enjoy this game very much and suggest it often.

Played once.  Nice game, probably needs to be played quite quickly to be at its best (we were rather slow), quite similar to Battle Line which is the game I'd prefer to play again.  I like the humour of the art and personage names, and have absolutely no problem with use of terms such as 'orgy', 'gigolo' etc.

Played once. It was completely forgettable - so forgettable that I forgot completely about it afterwards. When I decided to get rid of the game, my husband said 'it wasn't that bad', but I couldn't remember it so I didn't know whether it was or not.

I only remembered it when I looked at the box back, at which point I didn't remember the mechanics, I only remembered the Roman senator cards with names like 'annus septicus'. Forgetting a game completely has never happened to me before.

A nice 2-player game about bluffing your opponent. Your cleverness is a key aspect in order to success.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Easy to teach non-gamers. It's a little more simple than I usually like, but its fun, and there is bluffing involved. I don't see the big deal about the shuffling, it takes me about 5 seconds to shuffle the little 8 card deck (it happens about 10-15 times a game). Also don't see the big deal about the orgy cards... not like they are illustrated ;). Just tell your kids that orgy means "no vote". hehe...

In Caesar and Cleopatra, two players attempt to use influence and philosophy to sway the Roman officials in the Senate to join their causes. Sometimes secretly and sometimes openly, the players outbid one another in influence points on various senators, but thanks to action cards and other deviousness even the best lobbying can result in failure. Caesar and Cleopatra is part of the Kosmos two-player series and was awarded the title "Best 2-Player Card Game" by Games Magazine in 2001.

The way cards are played to win the influence of the different patricians reminded me of Hera and Zeus, but I liked that there could be some hidden and known information before the votes were called. There's still a fair amount of randomness to the game in the form of card draws so I don't know if it will stay around forever, but for now it's fun!

A two player bidding game. Simple mechanics. A fun game rather than a brain workout.  Rather play with someone I know than some one I do not as I think what I see as fun (second guessing/out bluffing my oppenent) would be lost with a stranger.

Played in 2015 after having last played it 9 or 10 years ago. 

It is a fine game, but I think it has been left in the dust by all of the other similar fare.

Up my score recently as we realised that we had been playing a rule on the starting hand incorrectly. With the correct rule, the game feels much better now, enjoyed my playing this time round tremendously

RATING: 6
Doesn't get played as often as my other 2 player games, but certainly a descent 2 player game to play from time to time. Like the mechanics used in this game: playing influence card with which you can bluff and the deck of action cards that you can compose in your own preference. Nice touch that Caesar and Cleopatra have their own card art although both decks are identical.

In 2007 i rated this 7.8. I was "young" and inexperienced.
After a second game [in 2015] i give this a 6.5. There is something strange in this game, it seems playing 2 visible cards is way way better to win and action cards are quite unequal and on average quite useless.
I'll give it a try again though.

RATING: 7
This is the favourite two player game to play with my mother. Only consisting of many narrow cards is has great strategic potential. Basically you try to win the patrician cards by placing influence cards beneath them. There are also action cards with rather fowerful possibilities to destroy the opponents' game. I have the feeling that this game is balanced out very well. Matches are always close and exciting to the very end and usually there is one big dramatic moment where one wrong decision may lead to win or lose. One very important decision is whether you place one card face down or two cards face up. Anyone who thinks that it does not make much sense to place one card face down is misunderstanding the core of the game. There is great potential for bluffing and planning your moves ahead (which is especially important for gaining the majority in one group). The endgame can get a bit tedious and quite random though. The game incorporates some great humour – not only the orgy cards, also the names of most of the patricians are hilarious (for example, Beate Uhse is the name of a German sexshop chain, it is the name of its female founder). Playing is a bit annoying because the wohle game consists of cards and you have to exchange, turn and move them quite often. Nice tactical game for two players.

After reading the rules, it seemed like a very easy, luck-based cardgame to us. After playing it turned out, that it is more. There are tactics involved, and the action cards, can influence the game pretty big. Handmanagement is pretty important in this game, as it is that the player who has the most cards left at the end of the game, can get a couple of extra turns, and the chance to win is then bigger. Nevertheless a lot of fun. Orgies are pretty annoying to me, maybe we will leave one out the next time we play this game.

2人游戏，牌有影响卡和阴谋卡，阴谋卡相当于战术卡，抵消别人的牌，看牌什么的，影响卡是正儿八经得分用的，影响力高拿走议员。游戏还算不错，有点当年玩游戏王的味道，不过因为不知道对方出啥牌，其实心理揣测的成分比较大，稍微运气了些。

Very good artwork; there is a little mistake on one card in the italian version. The mechanic of the game is not very interesting and automatically balance the strenght of the two sides after each round, making impossible to obtain a decisive victory over your opponent. Too bad.

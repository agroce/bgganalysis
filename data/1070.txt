Fun story. I first read about this game in an article about Essen in The Duelist magazine. This game was mentioned by the author, Richard Garfield.Magic was still really new at the time. I wanted to know more about this game he described, so I called Wizards of the Coast in Washington, and asked for Garfield, expecting to get his voice mail. Imagine how shocked I was when he answered the phone! A bit starstruck, I managed to carry on a nice conversation with him about this game and Magic. Nice guy.

Neat game that you play in the dark with candles. More of a roll and move game and there really isn't much strategy or anything involved but the atmosphere is what this one is all about. Plus, how many games do you know where you start some of the game components on fire in order to play!

RATING: 9
Enjoyable for children and adults (in my case) 
we tried the original way of playing and decided to spice things up for adult game, by having a second dice (meaning it's harder to escape the light) and also another variation of play is having to ONLY stay in the light and if you're in the shadows you freeze. 
just some suggestions. but love the original rules too. Especially nice for children and in winter as it's dark anyway.

RATING: 4
Hmmm.  Love the mechanic (flashlight tag on a tabletop), love playing with the candle, the small 3D trees, the theme of elves hiding...but the game just falls flat for us.  Not enough action, not enough drama.  There's a whole lot of 'nope, the elves can't move again this turn' and 'the candle can't find anyone new'.  It gets boring quickly, perhaps some rule tweaks are in order to bring more time pressure on the candle owner or to help the elves with movement.

Excellent cooperative game for children. The game mechanics need a bit of work, but the concept is one I believe to be unique - Played in pitch black darkness and the only allowable light source is a game piece. Very fun idea that is perfect for late night power outages. A session with experienced wargamers proved boring and too easy. The alternate (back side of the board) version proved too challenging for the wargamers whose minds were obviously stunted by the ease of the first round. I do find it gleefully disturbing that the enclosed matchbook depicts children playing.. kids, don't play with matches. This especially applies to 35yo  wargamers.

This game is beautiful and has a real grace to it. I love the asthetic nature of it. The cooperative element with the gnomes is fun, too. I'm not so sure the witch has a very fair chance, unless the gnomes are played ineptly, but its still fun. Sure, the candle is a gimmick, but what's wrong with that? Its a cool idea.

This is a great game to play with kids.  I have a 5 and an 11 year old so finding games which can capture both of their interests is tough.  This game is great because it is easy to understand and yet has a lot of strategy.  Definitely recommend if you can get a hold of it.  I ended up buying a copy from amazon.com.uk since this is hard to find in the states.

Now I've seen everything. I'm pretty sure playing this game in my uni's gaming society would be considered a safety hazard.

Only played this once but it was VERY interesting.  It played fast, it was a singularly unique experience, everyone enjoyed it except the 3 year old (who didn't like the dark, the 6 year old loved it) and it immediately sparked conversation as to how you'd make a life sized, live action version for a con game.  Something that someone has to do at some point in the future because that would be completely amazing.

EDIT: I've now played this a few times, twice with only the adults playing.  This is a really interesting, unique game experience and one that I'm glad I've had the chance to try.  Well worth a place in anyone's collection if you can find it.

aka Shadows In The Woods
Cool idea (move a candle around the board, players try to stay out of the light or get frozen to the spot), but the gameplay isn't too grabbing.

Good for a few sensible kids who won't flip out playing a game in near total darkness and risk burning your house down! But for adults or kids who're a bit familiar with it, it tends to drag. About 50% of games we've played ended conclusively - the others we gave up on due to how long it went on for. 

Components are appealing in a hand-made wood-crafty sort of way, but the rules are a dense wall of horrible text.

A good concept, but the game isn't very good. With a candle, you have to play in a very dark room so that they are distinct.

We had a lot of fun playing this. It's much harder for the dwarves than we first thought, we gradually got picked off one by one. Because you cannot cross the light, it was very hard to move around, so we couldn't rescue and the tide turned against us.

Just lovely to play, a genuine treat and worth the effort getting a copy and glueing on the hats and beards.

This is not only a very fun game, but an original experience as well, that's played in complete darkness. The candle light gimmick works especially well. The game parts are very well made and look beautiful. This would definitely make for a great family game with the kids, but us adults really enjoyed playing it also. If you can find the Luxus deluxe version. I'd definitely recommend picking this one up, as it looks great and is a lot of fun to play.

 It's really a gimmick game and I knew that going in.  I had been looking for it when my kids were smaller, but they are older now and I've finally gotten a copy.  It claims to be a 15 minute game, but after over an hour we ended up calling it quits.  My son did point out that we hadn't glued the hats on and even though the rules imply that they are for flavor, the extra height on them may make them easier to spot.  Plus, we were all playing the game as 'gamers' not as 'young kids'.  I think this is a pure kids game.

This game has a lot going for it--a totally unique mechanic (to my knowledge), cooperative/unbalanced gameplay, beautiful components, and it incorporates a large number of players well. If you have a group that enjoys the fun and unusual and can play something _just for the sake of playing it_, this is worth tracking down. It's a memory maker.

RATING: 6
This is really special, a game played in near darkness, with only a single tealight to see by. 

One player moves the light, which is a troll or something, while the others are dwarves, hiding in the shadows and trying to meet each other in one spot. Dwarves in the light are frozen in place, but as long as they stay in the shadows they can move anywhere. The troll shuts their eyes while the dwarves move, and then rolls a die to move the light.

The wooden pieces and board are simple as heck, but this only adds to its fairy tale charm. In all honesty there's not a ton of game here, although there's a surprisingly broad scope to mess with the troll player's head by talking nonsense about your moves while they have their eyes closed.

With the right people (children and/or the young at heart), this is a unique and magical experience that will bathe you in its warm and happy glow long after the candle has been extinguished.

We've played one game as of this comment.  It is very cool!  My youngest was a bit spooked, so we agreed the candle was a mom looking for her naughty kids instead of a witch looking for the gnomes.  The criticism that there isn't much of a game here is probably true, there's really no strategy. But I don't know how you can care, this has such a wonderful atmosphere.  The wooden trees and the flickering candle do give you the feel of walking through the woods at night.  The game is essentially hide-n-seek on a board and I say that as a good thing.  I love hide-n-seek!

A game that has to be commended for its originality, though in practice, it takes some work.  I bet that familiarity with the game would help you know how to best set up the board.  There is a lot of ambiguity in the rules that leads to just kind of making it up as you go along with the game.  But for what it is, it's not bad, the mood is a winner for kids.  I just wish there was a more specific rule set as well as a recommended placement for the trees, as the tension was missing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There seems to be a fundamental problem with the game. In order for the candle light to be "strong" enough to produce shadows, the whole room has to be almost completely dark. This means that trees will get knocked over, pawns are hard to find and dice rolls impossible to see.

The game is certainly unique and very pretty but I think too troublesome to set-up and play (especially during the day).

LED tea light change this game for me. 

The dwarves hide in the shadows of the trees from the wandering light. The burning tea-light [adult player] moves through the dark forest [mostly randomly] and tries to find the small dwarves in their hiding places. If a dwarf is touched by the light, it is frozen and not allowed to move anymore. The other dwarves try to release it. To achieve this they must wait until the light has gone far enough so that one of them can join it in the shadow. All the dwarves try to unite under one tree while the candle tries to freeze the dwarves. Who will win, the light or the dwarves?

Unfair to give a score.  However, my friend's youngest child (aged 5?) jumped for joy when this game came out.  So I think it is a winner.  I ask, has anyone ever done that when Twilight Struggle hits the table?

In the style of a professional theatre reviewer criticising children's theatre it is simplistic, one dimensional and pretty staging cannot hide its flaws.  However this misses the point . . . she literally jumped for joy.  What more do you want?

As an occasional experience-game with kids, this is wonderful. The game itself is thin, but the atmosphere is top-notch.

Most of my plays have been during the colder parts of the year, when the young ones have a chance to be awake when it's dark. I prefer to play with fewer trees and to have the candle-pushing player count down out loud for brisk play.

A very atmospheric game for Halloween. The room must be absolutely dark to play. One player pushes the candle around the forest, while the other players hide amongst the trees. A game of hide and seek, if you will. The goal of the gnomes is to avoid the light (or they become frozen in place until another gnome releases them again in the dark). Also, the gnomes can win if they are all able to collect in the shadow of one tree in the forest.

As the candle player, you need to be aware that you will probably be searching and searching all night for the gnomes...until they win.
The rules are not very clear, leaving a lot of questions about movement and goals; I find them to be a little ambiguous. But the game is still fun!

So far, I've only played this once. Sort of. The candle burnt out mid-way through our game and we were unable to relight it.(Nor could we find a replacement that night) This rating is based on the experience I had up until that point.

Very interesting game design. Simple to play.

The "stay in the light" variant on the otherside is rather simplistic and boring, however. But the default "stay in the dark" is much more fun :)

More an activity than a game, it gets kudos for being so ingenious and pretty. Provides a good feel of "classic", and the candlelight provides interesting ambiance. Mystic.

This is a pretty game where one player pushes a lit candle down winding paths and the other players play dwarves trying to unite under one tree without getting frozen in place by the beams of light from the candle. If the candle can catch and freeze all the dwarves at once it wins, but I'm not sure how often that can happen. Everyone liked the look of the game, but there just wasn't enough to it.

The concept of the game is really unique - even in the execution there are moments when you just have to stop and take in the atmosphere and the design.  That said, the game can out stay its welcome fairly rapidly.  Played once with full seven players plu witch.

--Mar2012-- Minimalist and pretty at the same time.
--Jul2012-- An amusing all-vs-one game, most appropriate for a crowd of youngsters (and, sadly, younger-than-my-kids are probably the target audience.)  Still, it's a very cute thing, and one I'd be happy to play occasionally on its own merits.

A unique experience, especially for young children. A real flame is part of this semi-cooperative game ... the room should be dark enough so that the shadows are dark enough. Very atmospheric with wooden components.

Pretty frickin' great little "miniatures" game that is totally dependent on its physical construction.  You really do need utter darkness to make it work right.  Just about as novel a game as there is.

[7 plays] Ruth and I made the dwarves months ago, but we waited until October, when the evenings start to get dark early, to finally play the game for the first time. This is an experience as much as a game, and I imagine the girls will remember moving their little dwarves around in the shadows of the candlelit forest for a long time.

We've played again several times and they always have a great time debating about how best to hide from the light and where to meet up.

Orrin is old enough for enjoying this too now, which is just awesome for a family game at this stage with all of our kids.

Most recent play 12/23/12 with the Davis gang, Ruth, Etta, and Orrin.

RATING: 7.5
Beautiful, fun asymetrical filler game for large groups.  I recommend talking with a high voice when confering.  It is amazing that it actually works as a game.  Best to look at it as a social experience.  Can sometimes be a little long for what it is. A must own for my collection. 

Update: I've won playing the witch, so those that say it isn't possible or that the game has no strategic value just don't know to look for it.  Yes, it is roll and move, but you need to be aware of the defensive lines you create, and which paths you are going to choose. 

Update: I won again as the witch.  I'm awesome.

[Kraul Deluxe edition] {Kid, racing; light, dark, devil vs. angel, cooperative; optimal 5-8p} A board game version of 'hide and seek'. It is unique that it plays in total darkness with candle. It is very thematic. Though it's designed for children, it's also fun for adults.

I can't play this game with my friends who are afraid of darkness :(

With  the basic rules, the light role isn't very engaging. You only make decisions when you come to a fork in the road. I was thinking that a hand of cards with different movement values (after you use all of them you get them all back) and a few one-time-use special cards (reverse direction) would make it more interesting for the light player.

Shadows in the Forest, neat kids game with real candle casting shadows, recommended by Effi.  Fun to play twice just for the novel mechanic, but limited replay.  Would recommend for kids to play few times, then sell on.

Oh the idea is so awesome, yet the game is so... not awesome. How very sad. The main problem is that once the gnomes start getting together, this turns from a 6 player game into a 2 or 3 player game, and a witch win can take a very very long time to play out. This situation is like if H.B. Reese got the divine inspiration way back when to get his chocolate in his peanut butter and then went on to create an industrial cleaning solvent with them.

Finally found it at Spiel 2011. Do I keep it for myself or give it away to friends with toddlers?

UPDATE: kept it for myself and after one play I certainly don't regret that. Obviously it's a childrens' game but me and my friends had fun hiding in the shadows.

Quirky little game but not a lot of real gameplay. I love describing how to play this one and watching people's mouth's drop.

Thought about getting an electronic tea candle for this one but I think it would detract in a major way. Leaving it as is (might get an electronic die).

Co-operative children's game played in the dark. It's novel, but there's not much to it beyond lovely pieces. The adult player can't really play to win, instead making sure the kids have fun. Still, it involves a lit candle, which counts for something.

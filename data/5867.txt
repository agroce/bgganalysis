This one has grown on me. I can't believe how many non-gamers enjoy it.  I don't think the strategy is that in-depth as there is a lot of luck with the first draw.  Never-the-less would pull this out any time.

RATING: 7
A rummy type game where you try to make a combo to win - in this case planning a 10 day trip through Europe. There are three methods in connecting tiles, namely walking (adjacent countries), by air (same colour tiles) and by sea (through established sea-routes).  It feels like mahjong to me.

{2 plays â€¢ 3 & 4 player}  Hate those map graphics, which may have soured me on gameplay, but in truth, I've never cared for Rack-O much, either.

Bumped my old rating up a point for the newer 10 Days in Europe.  Still don't care for the play (or luck) of the game, but I think the specific Ocean cards are an improvement.

Elegant little game where you're building connecting routes of tiles on a card holder, to make a '10 day' travel plan throughout Europe. It's super simple, but not without a fun factor in there as you try to come up with a winning route.

I thought this game was alright but no one else I tried it with liked it. My brain may just work better with this kind of game. I had to find one sometime! I like the mechanics of the game but it is a bit boring from the map to the cards. I like the wood card holders. 

I'm attracted to the theme and like brushing up on geography while playing. I'd get all the different versions if only there was a little more to the game.

Surprisingly, I like this game a lot.  It's light enough to get out on tables, it's short, it's educational so that it does get out on the table around here... so that's good.

This series I seem to like a lot.  It teaches kids... and to tell the truth, me too, because I have always been rotten with geography.

I wish the tiles had nice pictures of the places that they were showing, but that would get in the way of knowing what shape the places were.  Still, though....

So far, I like Europe better than the USA, because the oceans have more flexibility (in certain areas) than planes or cars in USA.

--- 

2015 Update: 

I fell out of love with the 10 Days in... series after I discovered that TransAmerica and TransEuropa using the SoloPlay rules are more fun and geared for solo play. 

I still think 10 Days... is a decent little educational game.

This game's mostly just luck. Because there's just one of each of most of the tiles, you can't base a strategy around any particular one. I've only played it 2-player, and I can't even image how frustrating it would be with more. I enjoy it when I play it, but then I don't want to play again for quite a while.

UPDATE: I find myself bringing this one with me for non-gamers more often, so I've raised the rating. It's really not a bad little game.

Even more fun than Africa!  I miss the cars, but the ships are a great new addition.

Just like the other "10 Days" games, has a high luck factor, but the trick is to keep your options open and give yourself maximum flexibility.  If you're stuck waiting for one specific tile, you've lost yourself the game.

A good little connection game - the geographical knowledge you come into contact with through this game is fantastic!

Quite a simple version of the 10 Days series due to the oceans.  It is quite easy to get from a to b.  I enjoy looking at the map and seeing how all the countries relate to one another.  A very good game for geography skills.

RATING: 7
I really wanted to like the game but it felt like I was at the mercy of the card decks as to what I could do. Minimal player interaction as well. It had the feel of geography Rack-O. I'm not sure what sort of house rules I'd use to spice it up because there are so many other deserving games to play that I wouldn't come back to this.

I bought this game after my family (especially my oldest, college-aged daughter) fell in love with 10 Days in the USA. My family actually enjoyed this game more than 10 Days in the USA. We then combined the two games into 1, and it was an awesome experience. Would love to get my hands on the rest, but they are way too expensive. Plan on using these in my high school social studies classes. These games really help people learn the geography without really knowing it.

RATING: 8
Europe is a continent with a robust history of changing borders, political intrigue, and silly pants.  These are all aspects missing from 10 Days in Europe, which focuses strictly on the fact that countries have borders and are connected by water, rather than the historical struggle to control the seas and colonize Burkina Faso.

Nevertheless, the European map is pretty fun, but doesn't stand out from the other parts of the globe.  It could be because I hate Belgians, but I found myself wanting to play other versions of this game more.  As they say in Europe, "them's the breaks."

A bit overly simple.  This is definitely a great game for younger children (age 10+), especially if you want to trick them into learning geography disguised as having fun playing a game.

This game brought back fond memories of playing "Racko"
as a kid. I like the way the tiles are tied up in sequence and you have to puzzle out the fastest way to complete your travel itinerary. The european map also served the purpose of teaching my sons the european 
countries which they had to learn in geography classes.
Gaming and teaching at the same time. It`s a win - win
situation and the only way to travel down the rocky road
of being a parent.

Great little game with 2 people. But stick with 2 people. With 4 players, the game drags on and on and on, and the rating drops to a 5.  My wife likes this game much better than Rack-O,  which it has been compared to.

RATING: 7.25
Another great game in the 10 Days series.  This is such a pleasant filler to play with any type of group whenever you want something quick and light.

Particular to this edition, I found that I have a lot to learn about the former Yugoslavia region!  I do wish the Atlantic Ocean section was more clearly delineated, as the label for the North Sea looks like it's separate (this is more clear in the Americas game).

Components: Same simple graphics and sturdy components as the other games in the series. There are some countries whose borders are not so obvious.

Experience: Perhaps slightly more fun than 10 Days in the USA, because I enjoy how the bodies of water open up the board, allowing for some massive adjacency (like with Russia and China in the Asia edition). Quick-playing. Relaxing.

But it is still a fun game.  I tend to love most games with a map of Europe.

Played with 4 people. Need to create a run of cards that creates a continuous journey (contiguous countries, air links, and sea links). We all spent the whole time waiting for someone else to give up on their run, and drop a card that we wanted. Sort of reminded me of trying to fill an inside straight in poker by flipping over the top card of the deck, and hoping it filled the hole. Least amount of fun I've had playing a game in a long time.

This is probably my favorite of the three "10 Days..." games I've played so far (USA, Europe, and The Americas).  The highly interconnected nature of the European countries lends itself to the right level of open-ended game play, in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[16 plays] Another fun game in the 10 Days series, Europe differs in mechanics from USA & Africa because of the ships instead of cars.  This makes it tougher to get around, especially in the east (beware of Moldova!), but the ships are thematic and cool, and I still like the Europe version.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A semi-filler with simple mechanics. I picked up this "10 Days..." in particular because I found it the most evocative of the series. The whole backpacking through Europe thing, I guess. It's a good game, a little too simple for it's length. There is some strategy to which pile you draw and discard to. The "Atlantic Ocean" tile may be too powerful.

*update: yeah, the Atlantic Ocean tiles are unbalanced. and there is not much player interaction. i guess this game isn't aging well.

I value games I can play with my family (wife and 7yo son) and ones I can introduce to non-gamers. This game works really well for both groups and has been enoyable for me as well. I'd like to say we're all learning European geography but I don't think very much has sunk in!

RATING: 6
After initial setup you often realize you have to move several of your tiles/cards one place to the left or right, so you decide to drop them in order to picking them up again and putting them in the right position. That is, if you're lucky enough that your opponents don't pick them up or screw you by covering your tiles. All in all a decent game, but nothing more.

This game feels really light, I'm just not into it.  It seems like the initial tile draw is everything. Played a few more times and it was better- good for family play but really light.

Great for teaching geography, this is like a better Rack-o with countries (and more options) instead of boring numbers.  This particular title could be my favorite of the 10 Days games, as the sea ships give some extra flexibility, and there are double tiles of several of the countries.

Excellent little game with very high quality components from Out of the Box. There is undoubtedly luck in the tile draws but some skill too in planning ahead.

This is a fun set collecting game, and filler.  There is luck in the draw but the game is not void of decisions.  Creating itineraries that have the greatest number of possibilities is key, and so is knowing when to abandon a set plan.  Timing and risk taking fall into place, and the quick length make this a winning design in my book.  The addition of actually learning geography is a plus, and it doesn't have the feel of an educational game.  Easier than Asia, and on par with Africa.  Europe is tops on my preferred list of 10 Days games.

Surprisingly tricky to play well, for such a simple game. A little more luck based than my usual fare, but only a little. Very family friendly and, ultimately, good fun.

I keep this game on the shelf in anticipation of playing with my daughters, who are too young yet - although the eldest likes playing with the components. I occasionally bring it to the monthly gaming group I organise as well so it does get played.

[Rating and comments are for Europa Tour original version]
Two-dimensional geographical turbo Rack-o, and it's a good bit better than the old classic.  The geographical presentation creates a complex, branching relationship among the "numbers" (countries), vastly more interesting than the strict linear sequence of Rack-o. Factor in the additional flexibility of the planes and the boats, the multiple discard piles, and the pre-game seeding of the card displays - and you have quite an attractive package.

*Update*
I've now played several games of 10 Days in Africa, and it has replaced Europa Tour in my collection.  Although I initially feared that the cars would make the game too easy, I've found that the decisions are more interesting in the later game.  See my 10 Days in Africa comments for more details.  I will miss the whimsical artwork of the Europa Tour cards, though I won't miss the miniaturized board!

RATING: 6.5
I got this game for nostalgic reasons. More strategic and enjoyable version of Racko...I'll bite. I place this game somewhere in the same category as TransAmerica. When you add Vexation, I don't know which game gets the nod.

On the downside, after only one play I worry that the map detracts from some of Racko's simplicity and may lead to new player AP. As the map is slowly learned and memorized, this game will play more quickly and will thus be much more fun.

Fun, fast to teach and play, and educational without actively teaching, 10 Days has all the hallmarks of a  top notch filler game.  Looking at the journeys that people have put together is always interesting.  The Europe version in particular seems a bit unbalanced with the Alantic ocean tiles specifically being overpowered, but it doesn't generally take away from the game.

RATING: 6.5
The 3rd installment in the "10 Days" series of games was my 1st introduction ot the series and it shows the experience of the earlier versions in the design, by comparison.

The colour layout doesn't appear any more difficult than the other versions, and I find getting countries to match into your gaps is somehow easier here than in others, though one must be careful not to get stuck in the UK or Iceland.

The nice non-colour specific transportation choices of Oceans and Seas upgrade the connections from Cars, but having Cars (or the Railroads added later in Asia) would have been a nice addition.

I rated this a 6.5 initially, and even with more plays I don't see it changing a lot; to me this is the friendliest of the "10 Days" games, with the lowest entry barriers for new players.  It is a fun diversion, not a huge challenge (though I think with two veteran players it might become a lot more strategic in terms of discards and holds).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I like this game a lot.  I&#039;m geographically challenged, so I&#039;m learning a lot with this one.  I don&#039;t tend to take my games incredibly seriously, so I don&#039;t overthink, and I caution my fellow player not to overthink this one as well.  It&#039;s a game of card cycling.  The faster you cycle the cads, the faster you&#039;ll win!

An extremely simple set collection game.  Gather 10 location tiles which have connecting borders allowing you to travel contiguously from country #1 to #10.  On your turn draw one of three discarded tiles (or blindly from a stack) or rearrange two of your current countries to change their order.  Thats it!  No dice, player tokens, movement, money.  The game board is there only to see what countries border each other (nothing ever gets played on the board).  Game plays in 15 minutes or less

Initial negative views have changed radically after actual play.  This is a fun light gateway that plays very fast, with a fair bit of re-playability (lumps in with coup, timeline, & love letter).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Europe isn't much of a spin on the 10 days series with its only real twist being ship travel.  The elimination of the ultra-powerful car from the Africa version means there's a tad less luck.  However, I'm not very pleased with the lack of any kind of marking for the countries which have two tiles in the deck.  Basically if you like the other 10 days games, you'll like this one, but if you don't - I don't see much difference here to color any opinions otherwise.

A nice light filler game that plays in about 45 mins.  Exchanging tiles on your rack (in a 4 player game) is almost impossible and, as such, the game can boil down to who draws their 'one remaining tile' before the other players.  Some strategy with the choice of three discard piles, but invariably the tile you need gets covered by the time your turn comes up again.

I found the European version slightly better than the U.S. and it's probably best played with two.

Remember the game Rack-O?  Well this is Rack-O with a cool geographical theme.  This game can be won or lost on the initial draw of tiles!  Lucky tile drawing and good initial placement can really put you on the road to victory right out of the gate.  Consequently poor planning  up front can doom your entire game!!  Overall I really like this light game...if only for the educational aspects alone.  Thumbs up!!

[>5 plays for the series] This is a very light game that is easy to teach and learn. A good choice for quick filler (<15 minutes in most cases) or for non-gamers.

Yep. We have a winner here! A good whole-family-game which offers somehow same kind of feelings that good rummy games gives. A quite harmless game, which is easy to teach for the newbies, but "challenges" experienced players as well. One game takes max 15 minutes.

Really wanted to like this because we're into maps and because of its educationally value, but it was too dependent on the luck of the draw and everyone was fed up of waiting for the right cards to come up. Also very little interaction with everyone just doing their own thing. Not a hit for us.

Fun Fast Game. Played maybe 15 times the 1st night, taking 10 minutes each game. Got our money's worth in 2 and a half hours I'd say. Card randomness can cause frustration - play again! I think this is the most balanced of the 10 Days games.

This is much better with 4 players - much closer, and more tense, and longer, than with 2. Rating is for 4 players; with 2 players, it would be a 5.  

There is very little interaction between the players, so it does feel a bit like you are all playing solitaire simultaneously.

I like the Out of the Box versions of this game far better, if only because of the easier to see mapboards.  The five draw piles (C'mon, Mr. Moon, why must it ALWAYS be five?) is too many, as well.  The 10 Days series uses three, and along with the other changes, I like those games better (about a 6.5).

Another in the 10 Days series of games, the game is basically what I remember Racko being, but with countries instead of numbers.  It's satisfying to get your route together, but it very much depends on luck of the draw, and it seems impossible to determine what your opponents are after, making the discard a crap shoot.  I think I like it better with 2 than with more, but it's altogether forgettable.

I find 10DiE to be easier to teach than 10 Days In Africa, as adjacency to a body of water is less complicated than Africa's automobiles.

As the gameplay is virtually the same, the version of 10 Days In... that you choose is really based on personal preference. My girlfriend would like to travel to Africa, so Africa is her favorite, I on the other hand would go to Europe, so Europe is mine.

RATING: 4

RATING: 7
Good for teaching kids geography. (And for adults). This game seems a little easier more complicated than USA because of the ferry routes and ship mechanics, and traveling in Europe seems more exotic than traveling in the USA. But then again, since there are multiples of a few tiles and there are countries with large numbers of adjacent countries, connections are easier to make and the game can end quickly.

If you like the 10 Days series, this is a good buy to add geographical variety. If you haven't played the other games, I would try your local geography first, and then branch out later. But then this might be worth trying if you like European geography.

A little bit simpler than "10 Days in USA" because there's no case like Hawaii or Alaska--that is, exception to rule. Ships take the place of cars (as in "10 Days in USA"), but there are definite strategy considerations for how many different bodies of water over which to travel in a given game, or whether it is better to go for countries that are landlocked or bordering bodies of water.This seems to me to be a good game to involve non-gamers in.

Despite the high luck, lack of player interaction and downtime between turns, this game has seen a lot of spouse play ... due to the high luck and lack of player interaction I suspect. All over in 15 minutes helps as well. The trick is to set your display up so you have as many options to finish as possible, in countries that haven't been claimed and preferably in areas where other people haven't been claiming. Easier said than done of course - luck plays its part.

Interesting, challenging.  The rules are simple but the wiining strategy isn't.  I like it much more than I expected.  There's little interaction other than trying to quickly cover-up discards of cards the opponent(s) may need.  It's more of a puzzle game where you try to come up with your own solution before anyone else comes up with there's.  It can be tense and it is fun.  Also recommended as an exercise to help learn country names and locations.

I was surprised by how much I liked this game.  Simple mechanism, but the constraints of the rules can make some nailbiting moments as you wait for your turn to draw, hoping the guy before you doesn't take the tile you need (or cover it).  This game can be taught in 5 minutes.

RATING: 7
Revisiting this "old" connection style game highlights its shortfall compared to TransAmerica and the highly regarded Expedition. Firstly the fixed array and the various ways the countries connect to each other (adjacent, by car and boat etc) compared to the relaxed and linear linking means the 10 days series is a mental workout. As such it lacks fun (but it says so on the box) as players quietly work out the probabilities or best placements in the rack. It can be tense as you sight a discard in the hope it doesn't get covered or taken. But the biggest strike against the series is that it lack an inbuilt racing commentary.

Rack-O with countries instead of numbers.  A way to transition 'family' gamers to 'Euros' with the use of familiar mechanics combined with nice components and a colorful (but shallow) theme... but can be very slow and confusing. (And at least needs a map for each player.)

Dropped a point for locking up with no tie-breaker rule (or even a rule for running through the discard pile a second time..). Need to try again but I starting to believe that Rack-O does this better! Rack-O is 'linear' in numbers but many numbers can be used to fill in gaps whereas Tour can present the problem of needing 1 specific country (likely held by another player) or replacing many tiles.

(Suggest that players can sort tiles before initial setting onto their racks and having all of the discarded tiles available for selection.)

Because of the fact that you are unable to see what your opponent is doing, you never no who is leading until someone completes their trip.

RATING: 6.25
This was a enjoyable and challenging game.  The object is to connect your vacation destinations from beginning to end.  Each card must make a connection with the next.  You are dealt a set of cards that you place on a holder.  Once placed they can not be moved from position.  You draw from an undisclosed stack or from one of three dead piles.  Only whats on top of the deck is available to choose from.  Don't waste time hoping to get a card on the bottom of one of the dead piles (you won't get it and there are multiples of the same card).  You replace a card on your card holder with the new one you just picked up.  You continue to do this until all your destinations connect.  First to connect all destinations wins the games.

Have only played it 2 player so far.  Despite the tacky-looking holiday-postcard box graphics (which I guess is the idea), this is a simple but effective route building game.  Easy rules that belies the 'should I wait for what I want' or 'change my plans' torment of the game-play.  Plan your 10 day journey around Europe ... first to complete a legitimate itinerary wins!  Good simple fun.
***UPDATE***
Have now played this with four & found it started to drag as we had reached a kind of stalemate where we must all have been waiting for a tile that somebody else had. Whoever changed there plan first was almost handing over the victory. Score reduced slightly; I think it may be best with only 2 or 3 players.

It's quick, tense and seems to appeal to nongamers, and you can play several games in a lunch hour. We also like the cartoons on the country cards. Would anyone care to explain the city inside the bell pepper?

--Dec2003-- Played my Dad's copy;  it's fun, but a bit more fiddly than one might wish.  A bit daunting for english-only players, since countries are labelled in German and the native tongue.  Seems to play well with 2, 3 or 4 - which should be counted in its favor.

A pretty decent educational game about European geography (in that it doesn't sacrifice mechanical integrity for educational value), but to adults who already know a good deal about European geography, it's a little thin.  Still, if I was trying to teach a younger person about European geography, I could play this game with them without being bored out of my mind.

RATING: 5
Standard Alan Moon fare, where cards are drawn until someone finally makes a set. A bit too solitairish for my liking, but would make an excellent gateway or classroom game. More a puzzle than a game, but a fun enough puzzle.

I prefer 10 Days in Asia, which mitigates the luck of the draw a bit better.

RATING: 3
Good on occasion for a quick tour. Should be fun with kids. For me the whole exercise seems like just that - an exercise. There's no fun game to be found here. Players are at the whim of the card draw, and while that does provide some angst,and while there are some observational skills required when discarding, in general either the tile comes up that you need or it doesn't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game for the whole family that is not only fun, but educational at the same time. It is a great way to learn about geography, while spend some time with your relatives or friends. Players are tourists that try to plan a ten days trip around Europe before everyone else, taking care of the possible connections.

Picked up in like new condition from thrift store.  Decent game, but can be frustrating when you need only one or two specific tiles to win and they never come up.  Good for learning geography if you don't know it already! Mostly luck involved in winning this game with basic decisions trying to play the odds on what tiles will best fit together. I would be willing to play this again, but not sure if I will keep this in the collection long term.

I picked this up at the same time I got 10 Days in the USA and 10 Days in Africa.  I was a little concerned about it essentially being the same game.  However, part of the reason for the purchase was as an educational tool for my two kids.  At any rate, the use of ferries/boats instead of cars makes the game feel significantly different from 10 days in the USA for me to be happy with my decision.  I think that it is because of this that the game feels somewhat more constrained to me than does its successor.

Rating for europa tour: Essentially the same gameplay as the rest of the 10 Days series. Europe has the great beast that is Russia and it's quite an advantage to pick that up. Other nitpicks that have knocked my score down: the map is too small! The wooden tile racks (Out of the box edition) is much sturdier and handsome than the cheapo plastic affairs in this edition.

You can definitely see where Alan Moon got the inspiration for Ticket to Ride in the card draw mechanism, and also route linking of the game.

Slightly lighter feel than Moon's mega hit, but still always willing to play.

The Good:

Nice, simple, and quick game play. Good mix of luck of card draw and skill of where to place cards in your route planner. Plays well with 2. Wifey approved.

The Bad:

Can be out of the game from the initial draw.

This certainly doesn't feel like traveling around Europe, rather this feels more like a scenario where we are all travel agents looking for the best deals on a trip through Europe for a lazy cheap schmoe that just wants to say he's been there.

As an educational tool to teach children geography this is a wonderful learning activity. As a game it is boring and random.  Pull some cards with no information lay them in your holder, hope that it is going to give you a decent set up.  Now, hope the tiles you need come up. Often they will, but will be taken or covered by the time it gets to be your turn again.

There is no interaction here, just pulling cards and staring at the map.

Feels like Rack-O where you have to link countries instead of numbers.  Special boat and airplane cards make it easier to connect countries.  I'm not well-versed in geography, so analyzing the possibilities with all the cards in my hand and in the decks taxed my brain to the limit!  I am intrigued by this game and would like to give it another try.  Update:  Bought the 10 Days in Europe version for my wife (she loves the whole series and beats me about 90% of the time) and I like it the most out of the series, probably because I'm interested in European geography and unfamiliar enough that it provides an extra challenge.

Very similar to 10 Days in USA except there are no cars, but there are ships (specific to each ocean and sea). Each country borders on many more countries than the states in the USA, so there are many options for getting from one country to another, making for a potentially shorter game.

HUGE disappointment after the USA one. The map of Europe just doesn't work with this design. Europe is just shaped too different to work. Hastily constructed rules in place to fix all the broken aspects that make the game less educational (added fake countries), less logical (ferry boats that can only be used in certain ways), and just generally less fun (some countries you can go through twice on your trip). It was forcing a square peg (map of Europe) into a round hole (10 Days in USA) and it doesn't fit and fails to be educational. 

I will up it to a 3, though, because I did learn that Bosnia does in fact have a coastline from this game.

This is another game in the "10 days in..." family.

There's a big mess of tiles, most of which are countries but there's also some planes and boats. You start the game by picking 10 tiles to put into your 10 slots, one at a time. Once you place a tile, it can't be moved. After everyone is set up, you take turns drawing a tile, either from one of three discard piles or from the pile of tiles. You either put that tile in one of your 10 slots, discarding the one it replaces, or just discard the tile.

You want to build a path from your start tile to your finish tile, where every tile shows a country that borders the country on the tile next to it... with some exceptions where you're using transportation. The person to finish a valid trip first, wins.

It's a fairly simple game with a fair bit of luck. But it's quick and fun. My daughter is obsessed with geography, traveling and learning languages so this is a game that particularly appeals to her.

Akin to its Asian cousin, this is a workable entry in the [i]10 Days[/i] series.  Not quite up to the gameplay level of the African edition, and the tile holders in particular are poor and prone to warping.

The problem with the 10 Days series is how much the game is dependent on initial luck of the draw.  Of course, this requires some planning and strategy of placement, but more often than not, its the player who only needs one or two cards who can easily win.

I prefer the Africa and Asia versions over the Europe game (I know less about the geography and offers a greater variety of connections between countries).

This is a fairly simple game from a rules standpoint, but can be quite challenging.  There is a bit of mind games because sometimes you need to re-position a card on your itinerary by discarding and picking it back up.  As a plus, you also learn a bit of geography.

Of the 10 Days series this is probably my favorite.  It plays well with two, three or four players.  I have had success using this game in a variety of situations.

It is a great tool to help my students learn the location of the countries in a enjoyable manor.  Now if my board just had Kosovo.

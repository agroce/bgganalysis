Realmente complicado decidir qué juego sobre la batalla de La Ardenas resulta mejor, si este de GMT, BITTER WOODS o IRON TIDE. Cada uno tiene sus grandes virtudes, y algún que otro defectillo. Yo me decanto por IRON TIDE, pero me resulta imposible dar una puntuación distinta a uno de otro.

RATING: 6
Kind of an odd game in that it looks big.  It is big!  However, the rules are not a convoluted mess of complexity.  They are quite easy to understand.

It has nice chrome rules that abstract parts of the battle without burdening itself with unnecessary complexity.

The game is huge and the 2nd edition added a second map that makes it difficult to fit on to a table.  It has scenarios, which I think work better, because I would not want to get into the entire campaign and realize it is over part way through and then suffer through hours of seeing the obvious conclusion occur.  Thus, playing the scenarios limits the table space problem and makes the game more playable.

From what I have played, which hasn't been much, this is the best Bulge game I have come across.  It has detail without being too big, yet has the detail most of the others I have played lack.

Yet when I play the Bulge, I would prefer to play the entire battle, and this one is just too big and long for my tastes.  I would rather play the old Avalon Hill game, despite its shortcomings.

RATING: 7.5
I had to revise my original rating. Too many chrome rules, easy to forget, that require constant reference to the rules. And some gaming problems: if the Allied player places the paras in the woods, and forget Bastogne, the game becomes a WWI boring trench warfare.

I really enjoyed this game.

It is my first Bulge game and it seems like I don't need to try any other.

I just didn't give it a higher grade because of the many exceptions and details that you have to remember, such as: "when infantry units advance 2 spaces after combat, the second space can only be a forest if they advance through a road...". I am one of those that think this kind of thing really doesn't add a lot to the dynamics and overall experience of the game, but it sure adds a lot to its complexity and rules checking.

But don't misunderstand me. Despite the somewhat heavy chrome, Ardennes 44 is a great game. It has many clever mechanics, a truly gorgeous map and an impressively researched OOB. 

A'44 is immersive and fun, like the the best wargames are.
 
I imagine that the campaign game might be much tougher on the axis, but the shorter scenarios seemed pretty well balanced.

EDIT: after my first play of the campaign, it became clear that only a very experienced player can win with the axis. My rating would be higher if it wasn't unbalanced and heavy on the chrome at the same time.

RATING: 9
Magnífico hex & counter con bastante chrome y una dificultad razonable.

En lo bueno, los componentes de la 2ª edición son excelentes. Un mapa muy bueno y una gran variedad de unidades que permiten reflejar muy bien la batalla.
El juego rezuma buenas mecánicas en muchos aspectos. En el combate nocturno, en las posiciones de bloqueo para guarnecer el flanco de la penetración y también en las unidades aisladas sin suministro que tardarán unos días en rendirse en función de su calidad. El juego es muy divertido, y está muy pensado y testeado.

En la parte menos buena, la campaña tiene una duración muy larga (esto puede ser un problema según la persona) y si el Alemán no progresa muy rápido, llega un momento en que el Aliado le bloquea su avance y queda atascado sin posibilidad de victoria. Para el 22-23 de Diciembre si la situación está bloqueada, se impone dejar la partida con victoria Aliada.

No utilizar la regla opcional de 15 factores ya que lo pone aún más difícil para el Alemán (que ya lo tiene muy complicado por defecto).

This is the best Bulge game I have ever played.

RATING: 10
The best Bulge game I've ever played.  It has a large map and a large number of units, which results in a long campaign game, although there are single-afternoon, 6- and 8-move 'tournament' scenarios.  

The combination of ZOC bonds; limited movement through zones of control in advance and retreat; the unique geographical terrain (ie, the presence of 'wooded rough' hexes, which can severely restrict armor advance and slow infantry advance); the movement flexibility (regular move, tactical move, extended move, strategic movement);  the critical importance for the Americans to hold the flanks; a CRT which features step losses at low odds, resulting in units & formations being worn down with time -- all these combine to add a realism and add to the strategic challenge of the game.  

The only problem is that it's very difficult for the Germans to achieve the victory conditions.  I recommend a point-based system to introduce play balance and to allow competitive play.  It's relatively simple and doesn't change the character of the game -- I expect to be posting it shortly.

Some really nice, elegant rules in this one, all with a good Ardennes feel. But I found the stacking, combat and river crossing rules cumbersome. Overall this had a bit too much rules overhead and chrome for me. A must for the Bulge enthusiast, but maybe not for the casual gamer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After reading the rules to [i]Bitter Woods[/i] and doing a few turns solitaire, I'm eager to see how this game compares. I'm hoping it's a bit more realistic, as [i]Bitter Woods[/i] felt like a Maneuver/ZOC-blocking chess exercise.

[Update 1]

After playing one turn as each side solitaire, and seeing how the movement costs and road blocks work, plus the various rules for bridges, this seems a vast improvement over Bitter Woods. There will be no unfettered panzers streaking wildly up the center in this game.

That said, there's definitely some fiddliness in the rules, especially for turn 1, but nothing I couldn't get past. Current rating is just an initial/placeholder rating until I get a f2f game in.

[Update 2]

We played the 6-turn short game, though with the second edition rules. It's good, but I think I prefer the first edition rules. That 15-factor limit really irks me.

RATING: 10
A'44 is a very involved game, with a detailed 20  page rulebook packed with stuff. Not a game for casual gamers. Nevertheless, for those looking for an indepth Bulge game, this is it. It might take several plays to internalise all the rules but the game is designed so that the rules are not superfluous. In other words, there are special rules or exceptions to the rules but they make sense and only require familiarity to provide ease of play, not mind-numbing head-scratchiness. If you have a passing knowledge of the battle's history, grasping the rules would be even easier. Kudos to Mark Simonitch for providing design notes as well. They make for very interesting reading. 

Mark Simonitch's aim of creating a low-stacking game creates a realistic game that is tense for both sides. Just looking at the map and the position of counters will give a sense of the difficulties faced by the two sides during that battle - large gaps in the lines, daunting terrain etc. Figuring out how to move and fight in this game requires real thinking. 

This is not a game I'll play regularly but as a Battle of the Bulge enthusiast, I'm glad I own it. It is truly the best freakin' Bulge game ever.

This game has a nice clean rule set with good historical feel, and the physical layout is outstanding from both an appearance and a functional perspective.  I've learned more about the Battle of the Bulge from this game than from any other Bulge game I've played (and I have played quite a few, starting with Avalon Hill's Bulge '65.)

One issue that one must consider is this:  how hard is it for the German player to win?  In this game, the designer seems to have taken the approach that it was hard for them to win in real life and the game should reflect that.  I have no problem with this approach, but some people might cavil.

I've only ever played this solitaire, but it was one of the best Solitaire experiences I've ever had - 8+ hours of solid, good gaming fun.  In the end, it wasn't even close - the Germans only barely made it to St Vith before the 9th Armored charged down to push the tattered remants of the 5th Panzer army back into Germany. Would love to play this again.

Excellent: WWII - Operational - Medium

Plus:
-Maps are stunning. Visual appeal yet very clear and functional. 
-Rules (20 pages) are very clear, extended example of play and maps depicting situations are in color.
-Clear and colorful extended example of play, designer notes. 
-Excellent system, it is intuitive, realistic, comprehensive, playable. In fact it is one of the finest systems I can think.
-I am a big disliker of Bulge games as the Germans it is quite hopeless but this can be a real nailbiter. Germans depend on luck though as there a some points where they need to be lucky in order to keep outlook on victory.
-This game has more appeal to me than Bitter Woods due to the more involved movement / combat rules.
-The adjusted combat ratings of both German and US units compared to the 2003 version give the Germans finally a better outlook on victory (update: I overestimated the impact of this, it only marginally improves capability).

Minus:
-Germans stand little chance. Realisti yes but it would have been nice if it would have been more of a nailbiter. Still tense but this is because the German players depends heavily on good dice. Allied player is able to direct replacements quite easily to hotspots.

Solo-ed a couple of times. Aborted a few games as the German outlook for victory was zero but will play this face to face soon as Germans. The session report posted here on BGG was a great help and boost to see what the Germans are capable of. All in all great maps, great system, counters etc. 

I hoped with the improvements of the 2nd version the Germans would have a better chance but so far I have not been able to come anywhere close to a win (I have only played twice but I can't see much scope for improvement apart lucky dice at crucial encounters.

Still this is a highly enjoyable game and the challenge to do better everytime as German player is the name of the game.

This is THE best Bulge game/simulation out there. Has the best mix of playability, detail (road network and terrain, unit OOB's) and chrome of any other Bulge game.  Once you learn the rules it's not nearly as difficult as it first looks.

Having said that, it is extremely tough on the Germans to achieve victory;  as it really should be. The German player really has to squeeze out every attack factor and column shift, use every side road and Strategic Move and Night Move marker to it's fullest.  This means that the game is slow and deliberate to play.  The full Campaign and especially the Extended Campaign are Loooonnngg and become quite tedious after awhile.

Avalon Hill's BATTLE OF THE BULGE '81 and it's bigger brother BITTER WOODS are somewhat quicker, easier, and more fun/game-like but lack a certain flavor.
ARDENNES '44 is meaty and deep. But the Bulge situation is a grind, hence the 8 rating.

At its core, the A44 system is perhaps the top WWII game system at this scale on the market. The system is outstanding and deserves to be used for other similarly scaled battles.

RULES: Complex concepts (like the different movement types), but adequate for explaining play. 

HISTORY: Excellant simulation. Reproduces the actual strategy and tactics. Allows for alternative, but reasonable strategy. It feels like WWII op's to me, and creates a wonderful narrative of the battle

GAME: While both sides have exciting decisions to make and options to choose from, The Short Scenarios seem to be pro German, but the the Campaign (which takes a while to play) is pro Allied.  I have played with the revised rules once (now with rout) which helped the balance toward the Germans. Note re-2nd Edition: The new rules, especially stacking seem to help the Germans alot. I will need more practice to come up with an American counter.

OVERALL... For me....It is a CSP game (Can't Stop Playing) But It is more for the experiance gamer vice the competative gamer

Game is dragged down by tons of little chrome rules that you have to constantly keep in memory.  I have no idea why they suddenly dipped down to including individual companies for 2 or 3 units that had little historical effect on the battle.  In addition, the American artillery is very weak since it cannot be used to support both attacks and defenses in the same turn, which restricts the American player to a much less interesting level of activity than is found in other Bulge games.

AH's Bulge 65 was one of my first wargames, but I needed a current Battle of the Bulge game. This one has a gorgeous look to it. Stunning map and graphics, and a good set of rules that are comprehensive yet very playable.

RATING: 8
Lots of nail-biting tension in this one, with room for varying tactics, grand strategy choices, etc.  Recent minor changes to the rules were intended to help the Germans, but a German victory is still a very difficult task against a competent Allied opponent.  Restricting the amount of time given the Allied player to determine movement might balance things, and add some panic for a sense of flavor.  Weaknesses: playtime (for your first playing, book a weekend for the campaign or one long day for the 6- or 8-turn scenarios), and just a tad tough on the Germans.  Strengths: everything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
(Based on playing 7 turns of the campaign.)

A really great, playable monster game. Rules are not as difficult as they may seem. They are certainly comprehensible and the game plays nicely. My two complains about Ardennes '44 are:

a) playtime. It took us 7 hours to play 7 turns of this game. Given that full game takes 22 turns we would need 3 days to play full game. That's much more time than I have at my disposal.

b) I feel that one thing is unnecessarily complicated: distinction between mechanized/non-mechanized units and vehicle/infantry. For example some rules put restrictions on mechanized units, while others put them on vehicles. The problem is that there is motorized infantry that is mechanized but not a vehicle. This adds quite a lot of difficulty which IMO is completely unnecessary. Actually, this is true for most (if not all?) Mark Simonitch's WWII strategies.

The game cover looks...well, stint.  An unusual treatment by Roger MacGowan.  The map is, much better than the box cover, the one most detailed I have ever seen for a Bulge game.  This is the definitive operational study on the battle and playable too.

Really one of the best games ever published. Despite some minor map problems and may be little problems in game balance it is for me one of the best operational games. Especially with a simple rule you keep your division together. Also the fighting of the combined arms is very good simulated. I hope the designer will publish more games like this one and Ukraine 43.

Bon jeu avec des possibilités des 2 côtés, l'Allemand doit bien préparer son offensive et percer rapidement sans quoi la partie est pliée avant le tour 10. Du chrome, des règles efficaces mais bien plus complexes que Bitter Woods.

A fine game, well designed and produced. One of 3 or 4 first rate Bulge games I think highly of. .One or two rules make it technicaly impossible for gamer to precisely reproduce everything that  actually happened on the battlefield, but all of the key considerations from historical perspective are there, modeled well  and system yields surprisingly good results anyway.A bit more learning curve than my two top favorites on Bulge, but quite manageable anyway for any experienced wargamer.

A very comprehensive simulation of the Bulge. Top-notch component quality. Like Scotch, this game is an acquired taste. I like it but as others have remarked, there are many small rules to remember. Although I do know the rules, several always seem to be forgotten during play so I always leave the game with the feeling that I haven't played correctly.

Update: Too many small rules for my memory. Sold

Ardennes '44 is a great simulation and a fine wargame. The downside is that it is a bit long, as the full campaign can take 30 hours to play. However, the game contains a number of shorter scenarios that are really good. They can be played in a day. In my opinion this game is best with three players (two players should split the German command).

This is the best operational Bulge game so far, with just enough chrome for my taste:

The most important aspects of the battle are well depicted. The map and the play aids are beautiful. The counters are pleasant and easy to the eye.

Thanks to GMT Games’ Living Rules system everyone can have a well laid out and easy to read rules book, even after some changes in the system, to fix an undesired mid-game slow down for the Germans.

Even now, it’s still very difficult for the Germans to win and they must face the initial stage of Patton’s counter-attack…

Too bad the game ends December 22, 1944… (While other Bulge games generally end January 2, 1945.) I’d have rated it 10!

Date of comment: July 2006


The second edition brings the original game to the top level: A refined jewel, indeed! I do not recommend the 15 attack factors limit optional rule,though.

Before you say, "What?  Another Bulge game!" try this one out.  Presentation is very nice and the play is fast and smooth.  Love the colored "Quick Start Display" mini map.  Still ticks me off about the errata as quality control always seems to suffer in lieu of a publishing deadline, but overall, error free.  If you like Bulge games: pick it up.  Recommended.

RATING: 9
I like the way you can sometimes choose to prolong combat on the Firefight table, which allows the German player to push his luck in an attempt to stick to his timetable. The differentiation between tank units is also novel (e.g. M10s only give a bonus in defence), and allowing your opponent to pick where the traffic jams might happen can be downright frustrating at times. A solid 9.

This is really a tight game with a clear and precise ruleset which works really well once you get past the special wooded rough terrain. The Zoc bonds are bit tricky at first but when you have figured it out, you miss them in other wargames. 

There is a great attention to detail like the numbered hexes along the main reinforcement routes so you don't have to count MPs, villages and town hexes with a coloured border so you notice them even when the hex is occupied etc. 

It has just the right complexity compared to the amount of chrome and the scale is perfect. Tactically the system rewards infiltration and surrounding tactics especially with the 15 attack factor rule as well as the use of combined arms operations and I love the CRT with its varied results and the option to push your attack or conversely hold at all cost. It manages to capture the essence of the battle nicely. Outstanding game with a lot of depth.

Excellent game, original, easy to play, innovative.  Terrific graphics, maps, box and counters.  Best bulge game. (I downgraded this one after a couple of more plays...the mid game gets a little tedious and bogs down I think unrealistically...unfortunately, while this game has excellent design and production attributes it ends up being yet another bulge game where the Germans can win on points but can't easily replicate history, or ever really threaten the Meuse).

Very solidly designed Bulge game with a judicious amount of chrome. However, one worries the scale and lack of fog of war results in all sorts of historical infidelities as players play the classic game of making neat front lines: something that didn't happen in the actual battle except when Monty gave his order that saved the 82d Airborne. The result is a 'Bulge on rails' that pantomimes the history but allows some unhistorical liberties and doesn't provide many insights. (Though to be fair the same applies to most other Bulge titles.)

great components except for map off kilter overlap.
learning the game. Will rate later.
Edit: After several turns, I am getting into the flow of the game although I still must refer to the rule book often.
Do not like the first turn and special unit exceptions-just more little things to remember and don't add that much to the game. This game is at a comfortable level of complexity, but any more would be too much.
Edit after multiple retries of six turn scenario, finally getting the rules down. This is a fun game and not that difficult to learn if one is persistent. Having another person to play would make it much easier to learn, but the BGG folks have helped out. 

Edit after 8 turn scenario: Ah, the subtleties of strategy are emerging. Germans should try and block entry hexes on South edge of map. Also each side should use the zoc bond rules to hinder enemy movement.
Wondering if Allies can somehow get to the rear of the German troops and cut off their supply- will have to try this out.
edit after full campaign: wow, lots going on. a very well designed game that has enough decision making to satisfy anyone.

An outstanding representation of WWII regimental level. I particular like the take on ZOC rules. A very playable system and seems to capture the fluid nature of the battle that in one area the Americans are surrounded an just a bit away the Germans.

The maps are great - clear and function and look good to boot.. 
Rules are clear and I particularly like the extended play example. 

The Germans can run roughshod but their objectives are daunting, but that is realistic. 
Like there are multiple scenarios the initial breakout, and the Allied counter attack.

I would give this game a higher score if possible.  

It has tremendous depth of play.  Mostly strategy type game.  It will take a long time to play, but if you have a great book that you can't put down, you don't want to put it down.  This game is like that.  

It plays very closely to the actual battle and you will feel like the generals on either side.  

I remember seeing the maps in the movies of the big battles where they push around the little models as the battles evolve.  This game is like that too.  You get a great overview of the battle and having the ability to control your side completely is freakin' awesome.

I would play this game over and over again.  Got done with it and would not have minded doing it again to see what I could do better the next time.

This is not a game, it is an adventure.

Just ordered this.  I think I'll like it, but the time-to-play factor will be difficult to negotiate. 

After fooling around with this game a bit, I'd have to say this: I'm very, very interested in the tactical situation.  The rules are wonderfully laid out, with nice visual representations of the rules concepts (like hex bonds, e.g.).

My fiancee and I played this with the map tacked to the wall. Very intense game. This was my first Bulge game, so I can't comment on its value as such, but I loved the tactical situation. We both had immense fun.

As a simulation, the best "Bulge" game I have played. Tough for the Germans to win; detailed with very good looking components. Don't use the 15 attack factor limit -- Germans would go home early. All German panzer divisions should bypass strongpoints and move towards the West map asap, even if this means no or little attacking.

Arguably the best operational wargame ever. Have you ever played a game where the unit types (Panzers, infantry, panzer grenadiers, anti-tank etc.) actually make a difference OTHER than just providing different combat and movement values?
In this game there are many situations where you absolutely NEED a certain troop type to get the job done. For example, you need infantry to outflank positions where vehicles cannot move. You need Panthers and Tigers to soften up heavy resistance - and you need special tank destroyers to keep your enemy from doing that.

Very good hex and counter wargame recreating the Battle of the Bulge. The thing that stands out regarding this game is how well it develops into a faithful depiction of what actually happened as the Germans push through in the centre of the map while the Americans hold the edges but get pushed back to Bastogne in the middle. Combat is straightforward and due to the superior strength of many of the German units, the Americans are looking at using the terrain to slow them down (destroying and constructing bridges plays a major part here). The German player has a certain number of victory areas he needs to capture and while these are a challenge, they're certainly achievable. This is a strong Bulge game (many have been made) and is unquestionably the best that I've played focusing on that particular battle.

The Bulge is not my favourite battle but for some reason I have four games on the subject. This version is one of the finest games at this scale made. Everything works so well without over complex rules. Admitedly some of the tank v tank v anti-tank rules need referring to during play.

Each turn you consider not only the tactical options but the strategic questions as well. Never I have felt the importance of which direction I send reinforcing divisons too.

Also it play very well solitaire.

Overall if you are into hex based wargames buy this one

Very well done and thought out. Longish to play. Is there any surprise besides recreating the battle in a way that is so well tuned that the only outcome possible seems to be what actually happened. Any point?

As of now, this is my absolute favorite wargame. It has all: components that are beautiful yet very functional and of highest quality, engaging gameplay in a historical situation where both sides get to attack and defend, great solitaire suitability, rules that are reasonably detailed yet still very clear and not overwhelmingly complex, and the game is neither too small nor a monster. What more could you ask for?

Edit: After repeated play, I am lowering the grade by a point. It seems far too easy for the Germans to advance in the 7th Army sector and I feel that it is almost impossible for the US 101st Airborne Division to get to Bastogne before the Germans. Additionally, I found that a series of extreme die rolls early on can ruin the game.

Edit 2: Lowering my rating again to an 8. Nothing wrong with the game, but now that I have the excellent BCS Last Blitzkrieg, I just don't feel any incentive to play Ardennes 44 again.

One more BotB game to the collection, but this one has just the right amount of detail without weighing down the game-play.  Still, it's a mid-level complexity hex & chit wargame so if you're looking for entry level on the subject, there are better games to start with.

Undoubtably the best offering out at the moment for the Bulge. The graphics and game components are 1st rate, and the game system is uniquely well crafted to the battle. 

The game successfully addresses most of the traditional history elements and keeps a low stacking level throughout play. The 'feel' of the battle is undoubtably the best of any title on the subject and the rules that add chrome work very well. 

The only downside is that it only represents the German attack, not the US counterattack.

This is a really solid and well presented game (love the maps), but one that just doesn't do it for me. Its downfall is the downfall of many hex and counter games: too procedural, too long, and too fiddly for the payoff. I think I just prefer more fluid wargames where the players have more choices of actions and can choose when to take those actions. For example, not being restricted to movement in the movement phase and combat in the combat phase, etc.

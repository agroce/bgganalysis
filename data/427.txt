Never heard of Milles Bournes (or whatever) this game is great for groups (of the "right" kind) of non-gamers to get them into this kind of card game.  Yeah, you might never finish, yeah, people might hold a grudge, get over it, pass the J, I'll get em next hand....

One of the first non-traditional card games that I ever played.  Good fun back then, even though the rules are massive for such a basic card game.  I'd jump into a game if someone had one running.

A top favourite which gains converts wherever and whenever I bring it out. Amusing artwork, wicked theme, and enough cut and thrust to keep even the 'backstabbers' happy.
Don't let the seemingly bewildering number of different cards put you off. You learn what does what very quickly, and beginers can pick it up easily after one play. One of the best.

RATING: 4
Reliant on the luck of the draw with too much emphasis on take that moves. 

If you don't draw a market open or market closed card then you are at the mercy of the other players with no chance to win. Open your market too early and you'll be squashed by other players. Add to this the mechanic of passing of damaging and negative cards sideways and it can often feel as though you are being picked on.

The ugly artwork doesn't help alleviate the flaws.

This is a good quick game. My daughter loves it, especially the 'Steal Your Neighbor's Pot' card. The cards are too think to shuffle well, though they look like they'll last a long time. My directions were missing a couple things, like what the 'Doublecrossed' card should cost. Over all a decent, cheap game.

Grass is a nice game to play with standard players (i.e. not wargamers), even if even the wargamers can enjoy it. It is an aggressive game in which bad jokes oìto your fellows are a common place, so avoid to play it with people that cane be up set by such a gaming philosophy.

RATING: 3
The _worst_ instructions I have ever seen.  I hesitate to even use the word "instructions" to describe them.  Oh yeah, be prepared to look up a) what category every card is in, then b) What that card does, and finally c) try to remember which of the two rule books the answer is in (that is if the complete description of a particular card is fully enclosed in one of them.  There are several cards in which it's split among both).  Other than the above...  not bad.

Played this so much at Uni. One of those lovely take-that games that you play over and over again with the same group of friends. It is more about the friends than the game though. As a gamer I would say it is too random and too chaotic, but it is bags of fun non-the-less.

Man, with five players, the game just dragged.  Because of that, dropped one spot.

Update 1/14/08:  Brother in law wanted to play.  Had to review the rules.  The rules officially suck and the game does, as well.  Dropped more points on the scale.

Update:  I can't be bothered to play this again, but I do like some of the art work.  Especially the Catch a Bizz card.  :)

It's an alright game with people in a silly mood. My biggest complaint about it is the luck factor which can stop you from actively being able to playing the game. Drawing and discarding until you draw a "Market Open" card just isn't fun. Next game I might just try letting everyone start with a Market Open card to get to the good bit.

I guess, everyone will have this one game, that really klicked with the right group of people - and that you just love - no matter what flaws it might have. I mainly played it with three - and most of the time with the same two persons. (Hi there Bex & Jakob! ;-)  
And I don't know any other card game (with just one finite deck of cards) that tells this many stories ... comebacks ... double crossings ... the near win that gets stolen by the banker ... wonderful!

Yes, it might have it's flaws ... and to count the points in this game is really hard work. But if you get into it, it is just a blast to play. And no - you don't have to get stoned in order to have fun with it. In fact, I cannot imagine, how stoners can count the points right in this one! :)

An easy to learn and fast-paced cardgame. The goal is to aquire $250,000. Because it is so small, you can always carry it to some friends. Roundtime varies in lenght between 1 minute and 20 minutes since anyone can end a round by closing the market. Great as an inbetween game, but you definitely need 4 players or more. Otherwise, it becomes too predictable who owns the bad cards. Comes in a small jute sack!

I enjoy Grass more than Mille Bornes, even though Grass is a variation of it.  The theme really works with this game, and there is quite a bit of player interaction(Steal Your Neighbor's Pot, Paranoid cards, etc).  Very fun with 3 or 4.

RATING: 6
You can pretty much ignore the game's theme: it's basically a card game in which you accumulate the highest total (in money).  Quite enjoyable, with plenty of scope for foul play.  There are two instructions sheets, one with the rules, and another in which the players are introduced to the various game elements step by step.  The game doesn't make for much of a challenge until all the elements are in play (and once learnt, you go straight in at the full version of the game).All in all, a pretty good novelty card game, even though the satirical theme doesn't really come through.

I've heard some negative comments about this game, but I've always had fun playing it.  I know it's just a basic rummy game, with a theme pasted on it, but it's funny.  You get some interesting reactions when you play this at a church game night.
It might be funny to get a pack of rolling papers to keep score on.

This would have been a good game 50 years ago. The comparison with Milles Bournes is a valid one, as Milles Bournes is just as bad a game as this.  It was fun to play while I was a kid, and didn't know there are better games around.

RATING: 3
We played two games with 5 players. I didn't get a single Market Open card in either game. The lack of text on the 'special' cards (Euphoria, Double-crossed, etc) makes it clumsy with new players. Novel "re-theme", it just doesn't play right. The draw is too luck intensive

Played this a hell of a lot as a teen, and then had another dabble a few years ago. Now I tend to leave it as a happy memory rather than actually playing it. Still - wouldn't say no to a hand now and then for old times' sake. The end of game scoring maths is laughably complex for a game about stoners though! Never realised it was derived from another game (Milles Bornes) until adding it on BGG - this place is a treasure trove.

RATING: 4
Definitely a rip-off of Mille Bornes, without the player teams; due to this, the first player to play a Market Open is almost sure to be "heated" before his next turn. The Nirvana and Paranoia cards are a pinnacle of imbalance (pulling Utterly Wiped Out makes you lose the match almost for sure). The rulebook is the most horrific I've ever seen - as if a decent rulebook had been put in a blender. Plus I don't like the artwork - fauvism isn't my thing.

You can sit around a long time waiting for a Market Open card and if people don't want to trade with you there is nothing you can do about it (yes I know you can put Heat Ons on them but if they want to do you over that isn't going to sway them).

I played this game a LOT back in the day.  I really think that a lot of the enjoyment you get out of ANY game is how involved the players get.  I still fondly remember a hot, summer day with the windows down, playing Grass when one of us shouted, "you steal my pot I'll f***in' kill you!"

Good times.

RATING: 5
Ah, those were the days ... when this game was "hot".  We played it so aggressively that it was more realistic to set an end-point when one player had reached a certain NEGATIVE points score.  Suffers from the usual drawbacks of "ha! take that!" card games in that your ability to defend against attacks is overly dependent on your luck in drawing the right defence cards. Still fun if not played too seriously, provided you don't wait too long for a Market Open card.

This is the first of the Milles Bourne-based games I've played. You basically try to get money cards down on the table while playing cards that hurt your opponents or give you advantages. While there are some choices to make depending on what is in your hand, the best choice is usually obvious and luck of the draw plays a big part. Pretty average card game. How various sins like lust are supposed to protect your money, is a thematic mystery.

I always have a lot of fun playing this. Especially when you get to screw someone really hard.

I do think it's really weird that the people we play this most with (myself included) consist of almost all people who don't even drink, let alone smoke pot. Yet we all still love it.

Not sure how I got my hands on this one... there isn't much game there, just theme (and quite a yucky theme at that). There are 20-25 different cards in the game, none of which has any kind of rules printed on them: you have to either memorize everything or always look them up in the rules (stoned people play this game?? HOW???). This is the only complication to what is otherwise a very simple take-that card game. Game would get a 2, but not printing any text at all on any card makes it deserving of a '1'.

My wife had this game when I met her, and it sat untouched in the back of a dinky gaming closet we had at the time until we hit a rough patch.  WE were all very young (still in our 20's)  We and a roommate were all depressed and poor, so we sat down with another friend, read the rules, and played a few games to escape the dreariness of everyday existence at the time.  I remember having fun...but not many details.  And NO- it was not because we were stoned.  We were not under the influence of anything it was just a long time ago and I was in a dark place.  I cannot really rate this currently, and we are only holding onto it for schlock value now.  We plan to play it just for kicks someday and then I will give it a rating.

Perfect for 4 to 6 players looking for some good-natured drug-dealing and ratting-out. Bought this and played the 
hell out of it after being "turned on" to it at a very crazy hippy party in a Moss Side tower block apartment in my misguided youth - about the only game I played in my 20s, apart from Risk ( until I got banned for boasting about cheating) and Shit Head. 

My wife loves this game even though it should not really be considered playable with 2.

Best thing about this game are the graphics. Milles-Bornes-derived rules can mean turn after turn of drawing and discarding, which is far too unengaging for a game with this, ah, theme. Probably not as much fun as looking at that Yes album cover again.

Played a lot in the late 1990s, but not recently. It's okay. Would benefit from explanatory text on the Paranoia cards to save everyone looking them up in the rule every time they draw one. And the rules aren't very well laid out which isn't helpful.

This game sucked the life out of me.  I found this one needlessly complex and laden with so many detrimental cards that it's easier to go backward than forward.  Granted, this might be the perfect game for a group that has been playing card games together and seeks something a little more complex because they know each others' nuances, but otherwise this is a no go.  Also, the 'Banker' card is irrevocably broken.

We spent hours playing this game back in the 90's.
I don't want to rate it because a lot of time when I go back to these games they are never as fun as I remember. Mille Bourne is a perfect example of that (yuck!) and this game is quite similar.
I'll have to bring this out with my gaming group after all the kids leave.
4/30/11 - I finally got around to playing this one again with a new group. The *fun* factor is high at first because of the subject matter and the art. Surprisingly it held up strategically as well. I think because of the trade option and wild score swings this one holds up much better than Mille Bourne. We'll be playing this again soon I'm sure.
*LOL! I just noticed that they changed the winning score total from $250,000 to $420,000 (pot day reference). I'm not sure the higher score is a good thing though. Kind of like Category 5 raising the end game score of 6 Nimmt from 66 to 75 (hurricane wind speed reference). Oh well, too much of a good thing can never be bad (usually).

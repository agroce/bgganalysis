While I like the idea of the Fast Forward series, FORTRESS just didn't appeal to me. The game might get more interesting as you progress through the deck but the first 5 plays of this weren't interesting enough to make me want to continue playing it. I feel like FLEE might be a better fit for me.

The rules are completely confusing, even on some of the cards. Could you make them LESS clear? This is a good game, but not the explanations. Sorry, when you have seven total rules, and everyone in your group is confused by the language, there's enough of an issue that I wouldn't touch another Fast Forward game because of it. Just imo.

Fortress was the last of the 3 Fast Forward game that I played. I thought Flee was good and Fear wasn't bad, so why not try Fortress. Four of us gamers gave it a go and we were fairly entertained for an hour, playing through the whole deck. I thought it was the weakest of the three, but that probably has to do with the push-your-luck, take-that and bluffing aspect in such a small game. It was a decent, little, legacy-like experience with rules changing and cards leaving the deck as we go. I think it would have been better with 3 players, maybe? Not sure.

The experience was fun enough, but I won't play it again. The super randomness in the game with such a small deck during the play was enough to turn me off. I'm glad I tried it.

An interesting concept but I feel like it is more of an academic exercise in how to develop a game than a game in its own right. And you need to go through some awful play before it gets slightly interesting.

This is a slightly unusul game for me to rate this highly, since generally short, light, filler isn’t really the reason I’m into gaming. But this is just such an interesting pieces of design work and such an engaging, fun, and interesting game. I love the bluffing, I love how little information you’re working with and how you have to make really hard decisions. The Fable system provides a much more solid set of underlying mechanisms than Legacy IMO, and I love how it works in this case to conceal what’s even in the deck at any given time, and so allows the game to present you with lots of little fun surprises as a card you didn’t know existed pops in and out of the game. The playing time is perfect, the pace of individual games and the card and rules introductions work great especially when combined with the small percentage of the cards an individual player will see in each game. Really excited to see Friese continue to work with these ideas; I’ve said it before, but I think he’s the most interesting designer working in the hobbyist/classic euro space right now.

RATING: N/A
The enjoyment of discovering what was going on (and the information asymmetry between players over multiple games) made this interesting enough to continue through all 12 plays - but not by a huge amount, as the core play involves too much luck of the draw for my taste. (And an individual "game" - which is more like a hand? - doesn't last long enough to mitigate it via averages.)

A fun enough ride, but one I don't feel a need to repeat.

RATING: 6.5
I like this better than Fear but not as well as Flee. The gimmick of "learning as you play" isn't as good as it sounds, at least for me, because the underlying game here is pretty simple. I'd rather know all the rules before playing, even if the game evolves as we play. 

When it comes down to it, though, when I remove the gimmicks, is this a game I'd choose to play? And the answer, unfortunately, is no. It was okay to play through once, but I'm not really eager to give it another go.

The rating is for the Fast Forward campaign elements, not the underlying game. But as far as I can tell, that's the point of Fast Forward; the progression is the game. Learning is the game. Knowing things your opponents don't know because you drew a weird card is the game.

It's a fun ride.

RATING: 6
I probably wouldn't ask to play this again, but was interesting enough that I would play a few hands if we started at a later stage of the deck, when more of the rules and interesting cards came out. The game seems as if it is fairly swingy, which is acceptable for what it is but, which is not my favorite type of game. This system made me feel uncomfortable to play with acquaintances because I didn't feel comfortable with the rules, because no one knows the rules the first time you play, as they come out as you play and didn't want to slow the game down to reread each rule card enough times to be confident in the rules. This isn't necessarily a flaw in the game, however. I will say I did find a big flaw, for my tastes at least, in that whilst playing many hands the pace changed suddenly, and drastically. It went from a relatively quick hand all the sudden to several very long hands which were much thinkier than all previous hands with some randomly very short hands, and in some cases so short that no one actually did anything, randomly happening after this point. If I do play this again I would like to play just a few hands at the point where that pacing changes and has become more interesting.

Friedemann Fluxx. The rules don't actually change during the game, but between games they can. So there is actual strategy, as much as there can be for a light filler. But if you play several in a row (which the game engenders) then there is the feel of "what are the rules now?" I  like Fluxx, so there's nothing bad about that assessment.

2017-01-02: This is a fast paced Legacy filler. Friese gets the nod for once again coming up with one of the more random and innovative mechanics of the current game cycle (no rule book, just flip the 1st card - read and play along). Interested to see where it goes but after the first few rounds it seems like good old hand management/set collection + Take That. Not my bag usually, but I'll give it the 12 games to decide.

Festung ist das dritte Spiel aus der neuen Fabelsaft-Mechanissmus-Reihe vom Autor und Verlagsinhaber Friedemann Friese.
Hier geht es darum mit Kartenwerten Festungen anzugreifen und diese einzunehmen, dabei werden dann die angreifenden Karten zu Verteidigern und ein anderer Spieler, der diese Festung einnehmen will muss höhere Karten spielen. Dabei werden die Informationen wie stark der Angriff ist, bzw. wie staerk die Befestigung ist geheim (verdeckt) gehalten und nur die beiden involvierten Spieler kennen die Werte ihrer Karten. Insgesammt eine sehr gute Idee, aber hat mich dann doch nicht überzeugt.
Das Spiel ist meiner Meinung nach das schwächste Spiel der Drei, allerdings empfand ich alle drei als nicht so sehr herausragend.

The best of the fast forward series I've played so far
there is some take that involved but not too nasty for our taste. We played through the whole deck at once - 'finishing' it after 13 games. The game itself is average but I enjoy playing it, it's heavily luck based but you always want to play another game - fast & fun

A fun card game that is constantly shifting.  The idea of cards coming in and out of the game over time is definitely a fun idea.  You will learn what cards are available and by the end of the game some are already gone.  The game concept are simple and short enough that you will want to play several hands at a clip.

Tries to do the 'gradually reveal the rules as you play' thing from the likes of Deckscape, but fails. Early in the game we got to a point where it just broke - the game explained itself so incoherently, and seemingly incompletely, that in 10-15 minutes of discussion we couldn't work out what we were meant to do next. In the end we gave it an irritated shrug and packed it away. 

Like most of Friese's games, it's an interesting experiment in theory but doesn't work in practice - except in this case it doesn't work because the 'reveal the rules as you go along' approach relies on coherence of communication, and this just doesn't have it. With no rulebook to refer to for clarification, the game just collapses and thus isn't worth playing, even out of curiosity.

I like this new series from Friedman Freese so far.  This was the 1st we tried, and at first we were scratching our head until we all drew one card and got to the 1st interruption to learn more rules.  That helped, and then it quickly spiraled into wanting to play more.  Enjoy this game, but maybe need a bit more rules up front.

Had played with 4, but now with 2, and not as good with 2 IMHO.  Insufficient cards to really get to do something and it goes very fast.  Wife got bored even though she won 3-0.

This game starts like Fear did, with a seemingly pointless series of card pulls and plays. The game soon came to it’s predestined end (there really were not many possibilities for how the game might turn out, given the sequence of cards in the deck). Fortunately, the very next cards (interrupts) told you how to set up for the next game. Those new rules at least hint at a more interesting game, with some randomization (vs. sequenced cards) and deck evolution over time. 

Very likely, Fear has something similar which we just didn’t get to in our first game. I just wish that (1) they put some information on the back of the box, so you knew SOMETHING about what the game is about, and (2) there was some text in the intro rules that told you that the first game was mostly just a demo of the most basic game system, and not necessarily an actual game! I guess I’ll try to come back around to these games sometime​.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a legacy(campaign?) card game. The first few cards teach you the game, there is no rule book. As you get further into the game (by continuing to flip cards), more rule cards come out adding or changing existing rules. I'm not a fan of this aspect as I find it hard to learn rules when someone is reading it to the group. Also some of the rules weren't that clear.

For the actual card game you draw cards or secure a fortress by putting card(s) face down underneath it. Someone can steal a fortress from you by playing higher valued cards, but it's a gamble as they don't necessarily know the value of the cards currently underneath the fortress. This creates interesting opportunities for bluffing as someone might be protecting their fortress with a super powerful card that you didn't even know existed or they might be bluffing with a 1. 

I think this game does have replay value, but the first time through would truly be the best because no one at the table knows what cards there are in the deck. I like that there is a way to "save" the progress, but this only works if you consistently play with the same people.

Also note that it will take 10+ games to get through the deck. The box says 15 minutes, but that is 1 game, which IS NOT the whole deck.

first experience with the FastForward: it works.

the game itself is quiet simple, it's mostly a push-you-luck and bluffing game, with a bit of take-that (sometimes). took us 13 games in two 1h sessions to go through the deck and "finish" the game.

[+] FF concept works, different victory conditions, good with 3p,

Is it a good game? Not, the first few/~half games, which are very basic and random. But we had a lot of fun playing it. “What the heck is this? What is going on?” Exploring how the game evolves is fun, and each game you are curious to see what the five secret, new cards do. Is that weak fortress defence a new, powerful card or just a bold bluff? “WHAT!!!  You defeated my heavily fortified fortress with that!” and other players will not have any idea what is going on until they get to see that card themselves - maybe first a game or two later. And the final, fully evolved game is a quite good, fun game.

Christmas 2017 was a storybook tale of moonshine, deportation, and tattoo regrets.  It was also a personal milestone for the most games played in a single day (30?) because the family had enough interest, stamina, and enjoyment to complete both FF Fear and FF Fortress.

Fortress is the weirder of the two, as at least two games had a null result.  Literally.  The timer triggered and no one had done anything besides draw cards.  We also had rules issues, unsurprisingly, since Friese tops the list of non-wargame designers most in need of blind rules testing, proper translation, and a solid editor.

Buy hey, the holiday season is a time of tolerance and forgiveness. Fortress was a hit with the kin, and I'll get even more plays with my conflict-hungry adult group.  So yeah, I got my $14 worth.

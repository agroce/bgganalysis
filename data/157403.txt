A fun family game that plays quickly and smoothly.  The rules are easy to understand, the board is beautiful, the models great, and the cards a nice quality.  A light game that plays in under an hour with four.  Serious gamers may find this gem a little light, but it's great for the family and non-gamers.

Fantastic and lots of FUN.  Really feels like you are sailing the seas blowing people out of the water and stealing their stuff.  Your abilities ramp up as the game goes along.  Mostly tactical, but strategic in that the quicker you flip over your cards the quicker your abilities increase.  First class components.

Another one I had on my want list was this one by Space Cowboys. It's quite light in design - equal to Ticket to Ride. Might classify as a gateway game. It has crazy good production values - metal coins (!) plastic ships (that can carry cubes!) and extremely pretty illustrations. Top to bottom a fantastic product. Very approachable.

The game is simple: play a card from your hand of three. Each card moves a navy ship, your pirate ship and your merchant ship a number of spaces. Your goal is to use your navy ship to sink opponent's pirate ships, your pirate ship to steal goods (and possibly sink) opponent's merchant ships (and then bury their stolen booty on an island for money) and use your merchant ship to sail across the board to turn in their cargo for money. What's money used for? To buy your display of cards - leading up to a final goal card that signals the end of the game.

The display of cards you have are unique to you (dealt out at the start of the game). As you buy them, they give you unique abilities - moving your ships further, allowing them to 'break' rules (slightly), get more money for deliveries - things like this. Very nice for replay-ability and surprise distinctions for each player. There are one-time bonus cards too that you can use tactically to get ahead of your opponents ships - out run or out maneuver them.

This all adds up to great, easy fun! I was seeking out such a game to play with non-gamers and I think this one is very well done. I like it alot and would love to play again soon.

RATING: 6.5
Fun, light little take-that style pirate game.  Great components, good tactical play with a bit of strategy in the upgrade cards.  I've played it once with 3 and once with 4 players, and the 4 player game is much more brutal.  There is much more player interaction and blocking possible with the additional ships on the board.  Both player counts play well, but if you don't like getting attacked, you might want to avoid 4 players.

This fires Merchants and Marauders for me.  M&M is just overly fiddly with too much down time and outstays its welcome.  Black Fleet scratches the pirate game itch in a nice, quick game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Love the boats that carry the small cubes. Everybody is drawn toward the big board, gamers and non gamers alike; every type of player can find fun in it - the shy and the pirates. Can be a gateway game, though playtime is closer to 80-90 min.

RATING: 8
This is not a straight pick up and deliver game. It is more like a pick up, rob, murder, and sometimes deliver" game and it is great fun. Space Cowboys must have sat down around a design table and asked themselves, "ok. What is it about pick up and deliver games that ultimately causes people to get bored after a while and lose interest? Hmm, probably because after a while people realize that this isn't enough. How about we add some robbery, destruction, and cards with special actions to the mix? Yeah that works!". Black Fleet does a lot right. The design is excellent from the beautiful art and 3D ships with spaces to place cubes right down to the skull and crossbones insert. The learn time is short but the play is still complex enough to keep casuals and gamers alike engaged in play that does not over stay its welcome. There are really nice touches like powers you can unlock that are random and different per player every game and variants that can increase or decrease the length of the game. At its core, black fleet is a game where you play multiple strategies in order to earn enough gold to unlock four upgrades (identical to machi korros game clock of unlocking specific buildings to end the game) and then trigger end game scoring through paying off the governors daughters ransom. The multiple strategies involve being a pirate that steals treasure and buries it on islands for money, a merchant vessel that transports goods from one port to another, and an imperial navy that earns money for destroying pirate ships. Throughout the game you are constantly moving ships, blocking other ships, robbing other ships and running from other ships. The only hang ups, are that as is the case with most take that conflict games, king making can happen and sometimes it is best to be in second place until it is time to win the game. Bravo Space Cowboys. That is two really good games in a row.

1st play: This game is beautifully produced, and looks great on the table.  Unfortunately there's no substance behind it.  The moves are pretty painfully obvious, there's a lot of take-that random screwage, and everyone bought their final improvement on the same turn.  Pointless and frustrating waste of a pick.

This game came and went really quietly and that is a crying shame in my opinion.  This is a rock solid entry level game.  There is a lot of take that and attacking, but everything comes back on your next turn, you don't lose much when attacked and everyone is constantly swinging right back so it has never felt mean even with really passive gamers.

I love the idea that everyone is playing merchants, pirates AND the military all at the same time.

I really want to design a board that can more easily handle 5-6 players, as it moves fast enough on the turns to handle that kind of player count.

RATING: 6
I wonder if maybe I just don't have the correct group.  It's just a bit too much of a pain to setup, and a bit too long to really enjoy in my family, we rarely finish in 60m.  I play with my children aged 8 and 10. They can play just fine, they like it, but as a group it isn't as much fun as others and it tends to drag on. I think the sweet spot for us is just a shorter game that's just a bit easier to play on a per turn basis. People simply loose focus, and the special power cards just don't bring the game together the way they should.

Fantastic family game, quick turns, easy to teach, simple gameplay with enough options to keep you noobs, kids and gamers occupied.  Some of the most gorgeous artwork and component design I have ever seen in a game.  The board and ships, the cards, the metal coins are stunningly beautiful and even small details like the box insert is moulded into a skull and crossbones makes this a quality product in every sense of the word.  Light, fun, highly enjoyable and very, very accessible - this is what I call a family game.

Light pickup and deliver game with pirates, navy, and merchant ships.  Variable cards with different movement offer different choices each round on what to do.  

Positives:
Light and fun theme.  Determining the optimal path with your two action cards can be fun.  

Negatives:
Widely different powers for the Fortune cards and some are useless for your situation.  Some "take that" mechanism which leads to a "Cosmic Encounter" type beat down where you re-evaluate each turn who is in the lead to try to take them down.  Lots of rule breaking powers which have an impact on your actions.  Black merchant ships can attack merchant ships, but brown pirate ships can attack pirate ships, etc.

Fun, almost frantic game of piracy, pick up and deliver, with colorful artwork. I like that you're moving each of the three ship types on your turn, and the fluidity of the mechanics. Be warned, though, the elegance and simplicity of the combat ensures that you WILL lose some ships and goods, so plan accordingly and don't whine when it happens. Think of Black Fleet as a family weight distillation of Merchants & Marauders, and it functions well on that level.

Great card movement game that is part supply runner, part battleship commander. There are a lot of great design choices here and the only thing I have slight qualms about is there are some balance issues. (Some of the development cards are clearly better than others.) Not a big deal though, you can still gain victory with some of the weaker developments (My first development did jack squat but I still got the W) and the way the cards can change your strategy on the fly is actually pretty damn cool. Great game.

Black Fleet is the most astonishing case of overproduction I encountered in many years of gaming. Everything is awesome: the miniature ships, the metal coins, the artwork. Even the box insert.

Gameplay is light, chaotic and funny. It is absolutely a tactical game, where it is almost impossible to strategize. 

It is definitely not a gamer's game, but I recognize its potential as a family game: it's random, but in an awkward, cartoony and silly way; it plays fast (60 minutes tops); it's full of take-that in-your-face moments, and probably some kingmaking...

Eager to play again, for some lightweight excursion outside the euro comfort-zone!

Mooi bord en materiaal.

elementen van Serenissima.
Goederen opladen in je boot en deze naar een eiland brengen waar ze ze nodig hebben.
Ondertussen bedien je ook een piratenboot en de navy boten.

Dankzij de kaarten en de bijzondere eigenschappen die je kan kopen, biedt dit spel wat variatie.
14+ staat op de doos.  Yeah right, het spel is zeer eenvoudig, en laat zich volgens mij spelen door kinderen ook.
Jammer van de taalgevoeligheid van de kaarten.

Spel wordt pas interessant na enkele rondjes als je lotskaarten gaat combineren, en ook victory kaarten hebt kunnen omdraaien.

Very light game play, as someone else has said if you like Jamaica pirate game then you will love this.

My problem is that I would pitch this more to the younger players, yet lots of card text to read pretty much rules that out for the age group I think it would suit more.

The fact the game only play 3 or 4 is another cannon ball that sinks this game.
I have played a lot worse, but this will not be played by my group again.

Metal coins are cool but not distinguishable enough in less than perfect light.

Love the art and nice idea though.

RATING: 7
Great components and art. Overall it's a pick-up-and-deliver game with a fair amount of take-that. Not a game for people that will easily get angry. The main negative is this feels like it should be a 45-60 min game but it takes almost twice that long to finish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Is good, light gaming. Gorgeous components, but not a big fan of the artwork. The game suffers from being too random. I like the randomness of the movement cards, but having those along with the randomness of the development cards makes for an unbalanced game. If the development cards were played more like Libertalia, where they are randomly drawn, but each player has the same cards, this could make for a better and more strategically balanced game.

Really awesome pick up and deliver game with mechanics similar to Firefly: The Game, but with roughly 3 hours shaved off the playtime. Elegant and fun.

What a beautiful game!

All you need to be awe-struck by Black Fleet is casting a glance at the set-up board: from the stunning components to the captivating theme, from the simple rules that foster interaction to the cute art, everything looks like it has been made to inspire and entertain players with loads of light-hearted fun. (September 2014)

[b]Update[/b] - After several games with my regular group it finally clicked: despite the nasty interaction and seeming chaos on the board, which at first made this game so attractive for me, Black Fleet still rewards the more reflexive and thoughtful players, those who plan every move in advance and carefully ponder pluses and minuses of every option instead of simply charging head-on into the closest opponent.

Simply, there’s no randomness nor luck in this game or, more correctly, there isn’t enough of it, which equals to none at all: playing Black Fleet with a light-hearted, carefree spirit will always prevent that player from running for success, let alone actually winning the game. But there’s no other way of playing and having fun in my book than this.

Thus in April 2015 I lowered my rating from 9 to 7, which is still too high a rating for how the game plays but I really enjoy this both its theme and components.

Initial Impressions:
-------------------------
The built in eco-system in the game sounds interesting, but wasn't all that interesting during the game.  Probably a little too light and "take that" for the people i mostly play with, but I could see this being a fun family game.  The artwork and components are top notch.

This feels like a mass market family game from the 1980s that has had most of it's intolerable rough edges sanded off while still retaining it's bite.

Great as a family game, but nothing here grabs me or makes me want to seek out a game of it. Lots of chaos and you definitely can't plan before your turn - which is ok if the turns move at a clip, but because you have to consider the movement of 3 ships and you have 2 cards to pick from plus a possible 3 power cards it can feel like the turns take too long.

In the end I felt for the lightness and lack of planning there was too much waiting around. Not sure how it scales with player numbers too, they could have done an alternate map on the reverse of the board for less players to make the map smaller.

I feel like I'm becoming a grumpy old man, but my ratings of new games have been pretty universally poor for a while now.  It just seems to me that there's too much emphasis on components and not much on gameplay.

This one is a good example... it LOOKS like a kids game, and mostly plays like one too, but it is certainly too difficult for most children.

Just too long, and not a whole lot of decision making.   Just cross your fingers and hope you don't get sunk.   Eh.

Black Fleet is a pickup and delivery game with some added piracy. I'm a big fan of pirate game, but I'm usually disappointed by them... This game looks fantastic, has great components and isn't half bad... The majority of this game is pickup and deliver, broken up by a bit of hand management and some piracy. The victory conditions come straight out of Machi Koro. I enjoyed this and I would play it again if someone else picked it...

RATING: 6
Man, I was really looking forward to this one. I love the pirate theme, love the artwork, and love the concept behind the game: a race to get gold by selling goods, looting ships, and buying upgrades with special abilities. Unfortunately, the gameplay is rather bland. Move three ships, repeat. And repeat. And repeat. It gets old really fast. 

I like that you can sink your opponents' ships without totally ruining their game (as it can in Merchants and Marauders), and I think it's fun to trigger combos with your special abilities. I'd like to try the 2-player variant to see if the challenge/interest increases with the added complexity of controlling two ships at once.

I liked this game. As a two-player there was enough depth to award efficiency in picking up and delivering goods. As a four-player it's total chaos! No point in developing a plan until your predecessor starts his move. The board simply changes far too much with 3 other players in town.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Way too chaotic without providing the fun. Each person has stacked special powers with the cards they buy and the cards in hand, which means you can't plan anything and everything you do seems arbitrary. This would be fine if the game was fun, but you sink ships and get a whopping 2 coins for it, and they then just reenter the board. There is lots of churn and little drama.

This game wowed me. It was the type of game I was always looking for, but I was looking in the wrong weight class. It's got boats on a map, pick up and deliver, gaining abilities and fighting all in one. A huge board, metal coins, plastic ships, the works. It reminds me playing multiplayer bomberman, just fun mayhem. You get attacked and killed? No big deal, you're back in on you're very next turn! Very fun, not too thinky, like Survive: Escape from Atlantis.

Rating based on initial first play at Gencon.

Seems like a win and then win more kind of game.  Hard for anyone that has fallen behind to catch up based on the first play.  To win you need to build ability cards.  Each card gives you more advantages.  Position of ships / Cards / Etc do not get more powerful / better if you are behind.  I guess you gang up on people to keep balance, but it is hard when the leader has reduced penalties / additional powers.

Very easy and fun pick up and deliver game with a take that twist. Awesome art and components. 
It has a very interesting movement mechanic of using a choice of movement cards instead of dice rolls.

Initially I thought that most rounds of the game would feel quite samey, but as you burn through your fortune cards different tactics arise. I find that the back and forth of the naval ships can be a bit unpredictable, but optimising your coin-gaining rate via picking the order of your upgrades makes for a fun coin race.

Meh. Reminds me of Caribbean. Pretty simple pick up & deliver game. With a heavy dose of cards that players can play that do random crap. Not many interesting decisions. It has the same scoring as Machi Koro, where you need to buy a set of scoring cards, each of which also gives some benefit when bought. But in this game, the scoring cards are different per player.

Very light "piratey" game. It goes quickly, no much downtime or AP. You play card - get cargo - possibly pirate something from opponent ships and have huge laughs about it. Nice metal coins give nice feel. Small ships are very pretty and if you are good painter you can make them even more prettier. If you like pirate theme and are in a mood for a light game of plunder and treasure hunting this is a game for you.

Not a hard game but it does get increasingly more complex as extra skills and abilities are gained. My kids (7 and 8 at the time) struggled with keeping track of them all and i had to do that for them. That said, they enjoy it, as do adults who have played.

You just can't beat the component quality here. I think the artwork could be more clever and distinct (I think a lot of the fortune cards look the same), but the gameplay is a hoot. It's easy to knock someone down (and get knocked down likewise), but only temporarily. No one is ever completely out.

This game is underrated. Simple pick up and deliver gateway game. Components are overproduced and beautiful. The "take that" elements never really feel bad because you can usually get them back on your turn. My only concern with the game is that it could get old after multiple, repeated plays. I will probably use this to introduce people to board gaming so I'll just bring it out every once in a while with a new group.

I love the pick up and delivery style of the game, also the upgrades ytou can (and have to) buy for your ships.
But the effects of the upgrades are too chaotic for my taste especially if you play with the max #players.
Upgrades circumvent or add rules making the reading of the actions/reactions of your opponents difficult to apprehend.

RATING: 7.5
Black Fleet is a fairly light pickup and deliver game, and the addition of special cards that add special abilities for each player that differ each game gives it enough variety that keeps the game interesting.  It's a light enough game so the "attacking" and "take that" nature of the pirate ships doesn't really feel like it gets too nasty between players.  It's a fun game, and one I can see being played with younger gamers as well.

Not enough here for experienced gamers, but newer or younger players will tend to get bogged down by possibilities. Add to this that you can only prepare your moves one player ahead, and sometimes not even that, and you have a design that causes people to disengage.

Played at BGGcon 2015. 

You move your merchant ship, pirate ship, and neutral navy ships around on a gorgeous board to try to transport materials and waylay the other players. As you play you buy special abilities that are unique to each player and give you more varied paths to victory. 

All of the components are excellent (especially the metal coins) and the game should satisfy anyone with the simple desire to be a pirate for 30 minutes. There are longer gameplay variants if desired.

A gorgeous board with fantastic components.  I am not totally enamoured with the game however.  Good but possibly not good enough.   

You sail around picking up treasure with your merchant ship and delivering it.  Also you use a different boat to go and raid the  merchant ships of others.  During the game you reveal cards for cash, Machi Koro style, which give your boats special unique powers.  With 4 people it becomes chaotic.  It needs to be played fast to make sense of its lightness, but playing fast means you do not consider all the card effects that each player has revealed.  Given toward game end there are around 12 cards revealed amongst your competitors the game would grind to a halt with AP if you attempted to do this.  So you play on and chaos ensues.  It isn’t unpleasant chaos, it is actually entertaining, and it lasts less than an hour so it is timed about right given its depth.  But ultimately the desire to play again is not huge.

Overall, I like this game, it is very light fair but I can enjoy it for what it is; the concept and core mechanics in Black Fleet are very simple and intuitive game.

Some of the development cards seems more universally useful than others, while others seem very situational to situations that you may not find yourself being able to get positioned into.  I have an idea that may address the imbalance and that is to have an open market with cards of each value, face up, equal to the number of players; this may lead to players being able to build a strategy, adapt their strategy and force a higher degree of competitiveness as players scrap to get certain abilities first.  Note: This needs to be trialed before committing to this statement.

Family Gaming: This is a great option as a family or gateway game. The combination of pick-up-and-deliver, mixed with a little combat/interaction is fun.

It is a fun, easy to learn yet deep game. You control merchant and pirate ships and a pair of navy NPC ships on your turn. Merchants can load and sell goods, which is your main source of income. Pirates can attack merchants, take their good and buried it somewhere. Navy NPC ships can attack pirates. Every turn, you can move all types of ships, providing you with interesting choices.

Player with most coins win, but you also can spend coins to buy upgrades/special powers, which are game-changers! With these powers, merchants can attack merchants or pirates, navy can attack merchants etc. Each player can have five special powers, making great combination for each game. 

Very recommended game for party/family gaming session.

Fun, quick simple gameplay that fits its theme. 

The random selection of powers that you can acquire, allows for a lot of replayability and the board is suitable tight that you cannot hope to continually avoid the pirates, nor the navy. 

Artwork is superb and the cards are very clear and in simple language that means my daughter (9) can easily play although she still needs some assistance with the longer, more unfamiliar words. 

The merchant ships are a little fiddly to stack all three cubes in but gameplay is so quick that the cubes are continually moving about, the fiddliness of the ships posed no obstacle to little fingers but I found I needed to tip up the ship to remove the cargo. 

The metallic coins are a real nice touch as they have a good weight to them and add to the thematic immersion

Sokan felvetették, hogy olló problémás a játék, azaz aki vezetést szerez, az annyi előnyre tesz szert, hogy nem lehet már behozni. A szabályok alapján, akár lehetne is, de nálunk nem jött elő ez a gond. Annyira fej-fej mellett haladt mindenki, hogy minimálisak voltak az erőbeli különbségek. Nem rossz játék, szívesen leülök még vele játszani, de kétszázvalahanyadiknak meg már nem venném.

This game has everything you would expect in a pirate game, and a bit more. It is most strategic with two players controlling two pairs of ships. 3 players is a sweet spot for fun and strategy. With 4 players, it gets hard to remember exactly who has which upgrades and take them into consideration during moves and there's a lot going on. Even in a four player game you are never bored waiting for your turn, as there's just so much going on (and opportunity to "advise" other players on route choices etc.) and it's a lot of fun.

Played it once. I liked it. Not a very deep game, but it is fun attacking someone else. You may or may not get a big pirate experience from this. Can easily play with kids. needs more playtesting.

Possibly only a 9 even just an 8, if the randomness becomes too unbearable. But after 3 plays I have only seen one player getting out of reach. In one other game a player got really unlucky, but in the 3 games, the 10 other players were all within grasp of victory within a round or two.

So far my favorite pirate-themed game, even if it is a bit silly.

RATING: 7
Finally a pirate-themed family game that really is about piracy and not ridiculously random! There is luck in the cards, of course, and player-interaction chaos, but it's a fun light Euro with deterministic combat and no use of dice. The biggest problem is that it needs four players to shine, as there is too much space with three. Although I'm not a fan of the cartoony style, the ship miniatures are very nice and match the artwork.

RATING: 4.5
This one is exactly as I thought it would be, even though I hoped for more. It's a nice family game where luck takes a huge part of the game (= not my kind of game). Reminds me of a more interesting version of "Jamaica", but that won't change a thing.

This is a hit and miss depending on the crowd you're playing with. Some games, people would work together to gang up on another player. That could ruin the game for that player. The art is beautiful and have physical ships being able to load and unload stuff is pretty cool.

our first play, and I'd say the children struggled a little with card play. So it clunked a bit. But they have seen and understand 90% of them now. So next outing we should be flowing.

I'm a sucker for pirate games.  I prefer Merchants and Marauders, but Black Fleet is the one I can play with most crowds.  M&M is too heavy (and long) for most, but this one is light enough that even the kids can play.  I have found that some of the power-ups are little overpowered compared to the rest so balance can be an issue depending on who gets dealt what.

We've also had a few games with a runaway leader.  If someone is able to get a few good upgrades before everyone else, then they can really start cruising while everyone plays catch up.

A pirate game dominated by arbitrary player attacks (it would be sensible to attack the leader, but they may not be in range, so you just pick on whoever is around), yet the scoring is extremely close. So the players collectively choose the winner in a way that's much more transparent than it is in most Euros. I'm struggling to believe that this was designed by the same person who gave us heavier fare like Keyflower. At least it's over quickly.

This is a very fun gateway game that has more to it that what you first think.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (September 2017)

I was moderately interested in the game due to its designer (Sebastian Bleasdale which co designed Keyflower) but after playing it, I can say it isn’t for me. Black Fleet is a solid family though.

The rules of the game are easy to teach. You can do it under 6 minutes.  Playtime is around 75 minutes.

The game´s components are gorgeous. It comes with metal coins which is a rarity in a non-Kickstarter game. The art is also pretty good. The insert is functional but when you sleeve the cards, they no longer fit in it :(.

For some reason I always dislike pirate themes, so I didn’t like Black Fleet´s, still, this is a minor consideration.

Black Fleet´s decisions are, mostly, easy and obvious. There is a lot of luck with the cards, but in your turn you don’t have much to consider. It also has its fair share of “take that”, a mechanism I no longer enjoy. 

It is very reminiscent of Caribbean, a game I prefer because it has meatier decisions (but I still don’t like it very much).

Bottom line, Black fleet isn’t the game for me. It is way too light with easy decisions and lots of uncontrollable randomness. I think it is great to introduce new gamers to our hobby or as a family game. It has great production values. I already sold it.

Hmmm. I really wanted to love this game, but I felt meh after the first play. It was amazing up until the last two rounds, when it became a game of player elimination, which makes those players feel like they just wasted two hours. I don't mind race games, but the end game scoring should have been most money wins, not most money between those that flipped enough cards over, that makes people feel like they wasted time. Unfortunate.

A fun pick-up and deliver type game where players use their merchant ships for carrying the goods whilst using their pirate ships for raiding other players' merchant ships. Oh, and there's Navy ships for sinking opponents' pirate ships! Good components and a colourful board make this enjoyable chaos. My biggest qualm is the over-specific player count of 3-4 players which can limit how much this game sees play.

Best pirate game I have played to date, I played Merchants and Marauders and found it to be very boring, dragged out and just didn't fit the theme what so ever.

Played with 3 and 4 players. The board was more cluttered and more chaotic, and hence more fun with 4 players. Endgame results were quite close. Game has a very good table presence; everyone passing by wanted to see what the game was about. For 2 players the lines on the board were a little harder to see when determining moves but it wasn't a big deal with the other players helping out. Super family game.

An unusually thematic pirate themed game, which did a much better job capturing its theme than a complex mess like Merchants and Marauders.

First of all, production quality is top notch.  Metal coins, larger than average board, colorful art, little plastic ships...outstanding.

This game feels like a battle royale.  But where Survive is a battle royale in a good way, this game feels vicious in an unfair kind of way.  The powers you can wield are so cool!  I always feel like i can't really plan much in this game, it's tough to calculate what other players might do because just when you think they can't reach you, they play cards and reach you and screw up your plans.  

Maybe I should approach this differently.  Maybe I should just charge in and make it a bloodbath rather than trying to play conservative and make my deliveries.

A solid little game of trading and intercepting. Paying VPs to unlock power-ups from a pre-dealt row is neatly done - it felt a bit rich-get-richer from my side of the table (if you're dealt a badly-comboing row, there's nothing you can do about it), but the winner only ended up a couple of points ahead of the slowly-catching-up second place.

Brilliantly designed game that I cannot really come up with a single complaint for.  I definitely like it more than Pirate's Cove and even a little more than Jamaica.  It doesn't replace Jamaica since they are vastly different games but this one is far more thematic.  It has a similar win condition to Machi Koro where you buy 5 total development/victory cards but each player gets unique benefits from theirs and they are really well thought out.  The combo really achieve a unique set of capabilities that you must exploit to help win quicker as it's a race in its own right to the finish.  The pick up and deliver aspect never feels tedious as you only really do a few deliveries per game and with each player having a merchant and a pirate ship plus shared navy ships the whole thing just really works.  Timing for the game is just right with an option for a longer game for those who wish via a double cost final victory card.  Nice plastic ships which actually fit the goods on their hull is a neat gimmick as are the metal coins, nice insert, card quality and artwork.  It's nothing too deep but a very nice family game.  Also it plays just fine with either 3 or 4 players.

Pirates, merchants, and even the occasional captain of a Navy ship all seek glory and fortune on the Caribbean seas!

In the easy-to-play, tactical card-driven board game Black Fleet, you're in command of three different types of ships: your merchant ship earns you doubloons by conveying goods from one port to another, your pirate ship by attacking and stealing goods from merchants and burying them on islands, and the Navy ships by sinking your opponents' pirate ships. With your (not-always-honestly-won) money, you'll improve your ships by buying advancement cards, giving you powerful additional abilities.

Outwit your opponents with fortune cards and combos, earn money faster than they do, and pay the ransom for the governor's daughter to win the game!

Sebastian Bleasdale's "seas, ships and pirates" game is a surprisingly fun family fare. Simple rules (I believe complexity-wise it would qualify for Spiel des Jahres, hey, I would have even given it a nomination or at least a recommendation), gorgeous look, funny combos and the game is gathering speed as it progresses. Not a very deep experience, but I enjoyed it and would love to play it with the kids in two or three years.

RATING: 6
The miniature ships are fantastic and really super cool!  Artwork and production quality are wonderful and theme is nice with good mechanisms.  

After a couple of plays, I really wanted to like this game more, but in the end, I just feel it is just deterministic and opportunistic.  My hand really plays itself and I don't have many interesting decisions.  I don't feel like I have any plan and I'm just trying to "make the most of my turn" in gaining as much money by either using my pirate on merchants within reach, or by using a navy to sink a pirate within reach.

It usually takes two or three turns to score your merchants move and delivery (if they have not been robbed of their goods).

I hope I'm completely wrong but I find this game is 90% tactics and 10% strategy.

RATING: 6
Light pirate theme game that combines pick up and deliver with some take that style of play.  Ultimately the places on the map and the cards seem a bit too balanced and generic for me for a game of this sort.  Maybe I want my pirate games with a little bit of risk and reward or dice rolling to spice up the play.

Everyone loves Merchants and Marauders. It's just a great time. However, it can be long, and the combat can get fussy. You don't really want to play it with four.

Thankfully, Black Fleet is here to help you out. It's not M&M. It's far lighter, less narrative. But when you have a hankering to do some damage to another player's pirate fleet, and can't do M&M, it's right there. What's more, all players have two ships, so it's truly merchants AND marauders, not merchants OR marauders. 

In addition, the way players spend money for upgrades, which also advances the game, makes the board situation more and more dangerous as it goes on. And this can unfold in different ways.

Black Fleet is a fun, light game with a lot of smack-around. It's not M&M but will definitely do in a pinch.

Unexpectedly an excellent family game, with good replayability with the different "powers". Good fun, a lots of opportunities to backstab your friends.

A good example of game design, ie. a honest-but-not-thrilling game mechanics is being boosted and made a very good family game by the special cards and special powers.

RATING: 7
I liked this game a lot, but I found it a little unbalanced with no catchup mechanic. 2 players were getting lots of cash bonuses and they other 2 (me being one) had no way to generate extra cash - as this is the path to victory I found it very difficult to keep up with the other 2 players.

Warrants another few plays to see if it was just the luck of the draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pick up and deliver seems like an under-utilized mechanism, and Black Fleet is one of the few games I've seen that makes it really accessible, while not making it abstract by adding variable player powers. There are definitely some issues with Black Fleet, namely runaway leader due to you getting more powerful as you get closer to victory, the movement cards not being particularly interesting even though they are different, and getting camped by opposing ships. However, the lack of competition in similar games, and the fact there is somewhat of a take that without just getting you wrecked from the game makes this have a niche in the hobby.

A pirate themed game with pickup and deliver.  Unlike Jamaica, this is actually fun.  It has the same art as Jamaica which I do like with great component quality.  You control and merchant and pirate.  On your turn you play a card to move all your ships plus a yellow or blue frigate that can attack other pirates.  You are trying to bury pirate treasure on islands and merchant goods to different harbors.  There are also special cards that can give you one time advantages and you can play as many times as you like.  This is what Jamaica ought to have been.  Great plastic components that allow you to carry your goods.  Does not overstay its welcome.  Family weight.

Simple pick up and deliver game except you can attack the ships and have special powers and level ups of a kind. Played with 2 and there are a lot of gaps. Prob needs more options. With 4 I imagine it is super chaotic.

With 4 it is pretty chaotic but amusing with it (although maybe not if you happen to be on the receiving end of it!). The special powers are great but you don't really have them long enough maybe with the 20 point endgame this is better. Also there is no real way to catch an obvious leader. Maybe ganging up. Good fun though.

Quick pick-up and delivery game with pirate theme and outstanding components. Gameplay is quick, no down time, and cards allow for variability although some cards could make for powerful combos. I enjoy it more with a variant: Players can't look at their development cards prior to buying them. This cancels possible "better draws" or clear synergy that would cause a runaway leader.

Although this game is advertised as a "simple" pick up and deliver, the experience goes much further than that. 
You really feel your ships are threatened by pirats and you need to keep good attention on what is happening at sea and anticipate.
 
This game is very interactive but doesn't feel overly aggressive, since your losses are never catastrophic.

I like the way conflicts are resolved. Simple and straightforward. And no time consuming dice rolling.

Unfortunately it takes a bit too long for what it is. And who wins is largely dependent on who gets attacked the least.

Beautiful material (ships and money). This is a light game, but one that is fun to play and cleverly designed. A pity that it only plays with 3 to 4 players. 

Minus: 1 - 3 (duration) - 5 - 10

Different from not than I expected.  Less pick up and deliver and more abstract strategy with a strong and fun theme--move pieces to the right position, analyze th board and the reach or other pieces, try to think ahead.

This is a special game. It's one of the few non-traditional board games that ANYONE can play. Case in point, I've tried to play modern games with my mother on several occasions. We've played Tales and Games: the Hare the Touriouse--fail. We've tried Love Letter--fail. Zombie Dice was even a stretch. But there's something about this game (possibly the thematic integration, or quite possibly the elegance of the game system) that people just "get."  In addition, the components are fantastic, the art is superb, and the play time is just right. I love this game. The only real limit I see is the player count, but I think I'd even try it with 2, if there was a decent variant. In the pirate genre, I like it better than Jamaica and almost as much as Libertalia. But those are different games. Jamaica is a racing game, Libertalia is an simultaneous action/bluffing game, and this is a combat oriented game. All 3 should be in your collection, and this is one of the best!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Man, I am not a fan of "light " or "simple" games, because they typically lack depth and I like depth. The difference for me is games like Coup or Blokus (light+depth=LIKE) verses CAH or Exploding Kittens (light-depth=meh) lose out in my vote every time. I've gotta put Black Fleet into the former category - this game is easy enough for a 10 year old to grasp and yet has a ton of strategic decision-making, lighting diplomacy, and a fascinating balance of cooperative and competitive elements. And the theme!? Get out of here! This game is GORGEOUS. 

I'll address the largest critique, which is the "runaway leader" problem. 

In short, it definitely exists. 

In long: I don't think it "breaks the game" or is a bug, just a feature. This game rewards you for taking risks and trying to pull away from the pack. The way to counter the early leader? You've all gotta work together! It's the pirate's code, matey! Don't sink people doing worse than you. Don't rob your friends. Just mob rush the leader until he falls behind, and be prepared to swoop in and seize that alpha dog position and be ready for everyone to set their sights for YOU next! :)

Not a bad game, but definitely not for me. Great-looking, big, dramatic, colorful components and (relatively) simple rules make this maybe more suitable for young-ish players. I'm not a fan of the attack-your-neighbor mechanics and gang-up-on-the-leader balancing. Also the random distribution of powers and vulnerability to being attacked makes for a kind of unsatisfying amount of randomness.

Biggest gaming disappointment of 2014...

Game had lots of interesting things going on, but just did not engage the family the way I hoped it would.

The game took too long to complete - people started to lose interest about 2/3 of the way through.

This is, perhaps, attributable to the many surrounding distractions at a family gathering.  Bottom line, however, this did not grab people as much as I had hoped it would (everyone liked Colt Express better).

I will try it again.

Fun little game, super easy to pick up, definitely a gateway game.  Ships are cool, cubes are cool, but ultimately the game is too repetitive and not enough strategy.  It's fun to move the ships around and there are take-that opportunities, but i'd only recommend for light gaming, or entry level stuff for younger kids or non-gamers.

It's a good and visually attractive game but it tends to lean towards the same thing again in again making it a little samey but if this would have been it I would have given it nine out of ten. The biggest drawback is the frustration players get when they are about to sell their goods when they get attacked by a pirate ship which takes away one of their cubes making them earn a lot less for the cubes. Other than the annoying irritation it is a very interesting game with beautifully designed miniature ships where you try to trade in as many goods as you can with your trade ship while robbing other trade ships with your pirate ship and dodging war ships which are used to sink pirate ships.

This might be slightly long for the amount of luck (you really need to remind players to plan their turn while others are going) and although the individual powers are balanced, some of the combinations are not. So players need to keep each other in check to avoid one player running away with the game (happened naturally in my games so far). Every game I've played so far has come down to who has the most money or only the final card behind. Beautiful and fairly unique.

While this game is fun and easy to to play, it suffers from a noticeable runaway-leader effect. While the decisions players make effect their outcome in the game a good portion of the game has to do with luck of the draw. This is a great game to play among friends and not take too seriously-- use Black Fleet to introduce new folks to gaming. The components however, are stellar. The artwork, box, debloons and a the cards are very high quality.

Looks and feels like a Facebook app, but the game is enjoyable enough for what it is. I'm not normally a fan of pick-up-and-deliver, but this is one of the few exceptions to that rule. There's just a little too much that is scripted between the ship battles and progression through the cards to make me think this game is going to be interesting beyond the first few plays. It's almost like the game plays on autopilot, while giving players a few kingmaking decisions now and then.

RATING: 7
I would put it in the filler category as the game is fund and easy to learn, it takes only 5' to know the rules. Detailed cartoon-ish ship minis and a bag full of metal coins make it tempting to cruise all over the sea and gather the coins.

In additional, I always add house rules to makes the game more competitive and intriguing.

One of the best family games I have played in a Long time super high production value, fun and easy to teach and the game is always tight in the end game, good depth of strategy there is a good deal of randomness but for this weight of a game that's fine its mostly just a game to have fun sinking your friends and family ships. space cowboys has hit it out of the park again with this one, they look like they are going to make a name for themselves if they keep putting out solid games such as this, I personally like this more than splendor

Awesome components (I love putting cubes in the little ships) and just a great overall game.  The variable player powers really add a lot, as they allow you to break the game's rules in some way.  It's always really fun to see what other players are unlocking, and while the game can get kind of mean when your ships start being sunk, you get them all back the very next turn.  Highly recommend this one.

EDIT: Still really like this one, but we feel like we've seen pretty  much all it has to offer (plus two friends own it, so less incentive to keep our copy).

This game is beautiful. It also sucks. Horribly. There are basically zero decisions in the game and once you get behind you can't catch up. You'd think that you could pick on the leader, but that is almost impossible, since the limited movement. Horrible game. I will not be playing it again.

This came as a real surprise given the designer's past record of slightly dull, sterile games. Black Fleet is riotous fun, first and foremost: a sort of Caribbean crossed with Machi Koro, but with far more legs than either thanks to a variety of setups and heavy player interaction. But, far more important than any of this, it ticks the primary box for board games: that of sheer enjoyability and style.

Oh, great box insert, too. You won't hear me say that very often.

I find the game exiting, but interaction is modest because you can only lightly skirmish your opponents. It lends itself to modification, like adding "domestic rules". For example, I usually add the rule that every time a player losses somethings must pay a doubloon.

[b]Black Fleet[/b] was traded away for Diamant 12/10/14. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This ended up being a huge disappointment. The game is beautifully produced, but in the end lacked any real staying power. Our subsequent plays ended up feeling very similar, there just wasn't enough variety in the cards or decisions you had to make. It was also much lighter than it first appeared, as we realized the decision space was much more limited than what we first thought and the game became boring and definitely outstayed its welcome (an hour is way too long for the decisions you make in this game.

It's certainly been well received by the gaming community and maybe I would recommend it if you are looking for a light, family game and the theme appeals to you. Personally though, we've found other games released around the same time to be much better (Camel Up and Rattlebones spring to mind).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Absolutely beautiful production, the ships are amazing (they hold the cargo in them) and who doesn't love metal coins?
- The board/cards have great cartoony artwork which works well in a family game.
- Excellent family game that is easy to teach and plays in under an hour.
- Plays great with 3, there is still plenty of pirate shenanigans taking place.
- Light intro into pick up and deliver games.
- Special cards are really fun to combo together and create a mega turn were you are making $ and sinking ships left and right.
- The powers on the cards you purchase with doubloons are all different, adding to the replay value of this game.[/i]

It was pretty fun, but not as much fun as I had hoped. The components are fantastic though. I would like to try it again with 4 though. It felt like there was too much open space on one side of the board with 3. I was able to keep my merchant in the open area as the other two players fought it out and I easily won the game doing that.

I really liked this as a family game. At first you think it's all about your merchant ship delivering cargo to get dollars. Then you think it's all about getting your pirate ship to hit merchant ships for dollars. Then it's about getting your merchant ship near the protection of the neutral navy ships to entice pirates closer so you can hit them with the navy ships. Your special powers might lead you more one way over the next, but the fact that you move all 3 boats each turn is the becoming feature of the game, making each turn multifaceted. Your hand of bonus powers (if you play a big move card, you draw no bonuses: if you play a small move card you'll draw 1 or 2) makes each turn more interesting than just moving the 3 boats. Despite this, turns are still pretty quick, with the aim being to make money as fast as possible to firstly pay for your special powers (in the order of your choice) and then after they've been bought you can buy your end-the-game card (hopefully) before anyone else. Hitting is opportunistic rather than malicious, and the rules and the gameplay are simple to teach, so it makes this a fine candidate for a family game coming in under the hour mark as it does. With lovely components to round it all home. An elegant design.

This is a fun, family-level, American-style, pirate-themed game!  The theme really comes through via the artwork, the three different ships you control each turn (navy, merchant, pirate), and the different cards you use (victory, fortune, movement).  It's a race game, with a core mechanic of pick-up-and-deliver, and also a bit of hand management thrown in.  Lots of interaction with other players because you're constantly trying to sink their ships!  Lots of piratey fun!

A VERY enjoyable sea themed game.

Each player controls a merchant and a pirate.  In addition there are 2 navy ships that everyone in the game control.

The combat system is super simple.  Navy ships kill pirate ships, pirate ships loot and/or destroy merchant ships but also get to bury their treasure, and merchant ships try to move goods between ports.

Very basic concept, but where it gets fun is the upgrades.  Of which you have 4, and each players will be different.  The money you gain from playing the game will be used to purchase the upgrades and they come in 5, 8, 11, and 14 values.

These upgrades totally changes the rules of the game.  Allowing ships to move across island spaces, pirates may now be able to attack other pirates, ships can trade spaces before moving.   The upgrades REALLY make the game fun.

The whole thing can be played in 45 min to an hour and that's with 4 players.

A solid pirate game that I liked far more than Merchants and Marauders. 7 is probably a bit high for the rating, but it will go up or down on the next play or two.

I liked that getting blown up and getting your goods stolen wasn't the end of the world and could even be advantageous depending on the timing. Game seems like it might be a bit too balanced although our initial playthrough didn't feel like that.

In BF, your goal is to gather enough money to buy a set of cards in front of you.  Money can be gained in numerous ways - selling goods at port, stealing goods from other merchants at sea, or sinking ships.  Each player controls a merchant ship, a pirate ship, and community naval vessels.  You move each of these using a card based movement system each turn.  The plastic ship miniatures are incredible! and can hold your goods as you sail around the board.  Rules are very simple making this a great family game

Perhaps expecting too much from the positive reviews I'd read, but this wasn't an immediate hit in our family. The fortune and development cards didn't affect play as much as it seems they should, and it seemed difficult to get the pirate ships as involved as we wanted. Big positive, though, is that our 13-year-old is almost desperate to play again.

Very cool game. Easy to setup, quick to explain, fun to play.

I find it is a good games night startup game, because it is very fast paced and not too long. The game is very cutthroat but in a fun way.
What this game isn't is a long term strategy game. It is an opportunity game. You have to set yourself for up and take advantage of opportunities. This type of game helps fight "ganging up" on a player which is fun.
The other thing is that the development cards for your boat are really game changers, which means the mid game is very different than the early game. 
Of course some developments can have too much synergy one with the other and a player could end up OP for a game but this is an edge case, also luck is a factor with the fortune cards, but overall it is fair.
And if you're in an unfair game, by the time it actually becomes unfair it will end up quickly and you will still have had your fun.

RATING: 7
Let me lead with the statement that I do think this guy has some problems. First, the game needs EXACTLY 4 players. Any less and it's basically unplayable. Secondly, each player gets some randomized player power cards they unlock over the course of the game, and these cards are really not well balanced with each other. The thing is, the experience of this game sticks in my mind, and I love the ~feel~ of playing it. I love how quickly your sunk ships respawn at the entrances. I love the movement cards system where you both get to advance your own guys and control the NPC navy ships. I love the tension of trying to get your boatload of goods to slip through the cracks. In general, I try to not list games here, or even keep games that require some sort of house rule to make work, but if there's any game that's worth house ruling, it's this one. It gets oh so much right, and just falls flat on the special power cards. I don't have the perfect answer as to how to deal with them.

A pretty fun combination of pick-up-and-deliver and take-that. It's a pretty light game, and getting your ships blown up isn't too upsetting since they respawn on your next turn.

I like the movement and bonus cards, which give some interesting decisions without making it overly complicated.

Cutthroat but not mean spirited.

The production value is high and engaging. It's Survive: Escape from Atlantis! and Merchants & Marauders combo!

.:Best 4:.

My Notes
Rule 1: Draft Picks (Dev. & Fortune)
Setup the Development cards in corresponding stacks by dealing out cards equal to the amount of players.

Roll a die; highest number starts by choosing a stack to draft. Pick one of the development card stack and pass left. Next highest number takes a stack and alternate the directions and so forth (like 7 Wonders).

This will determine First Player. The one who picked last, lowest roll, is the first to play (Black Ships).

Finally, draft fortune cards with the First player first to pick. Deal out cards according to number of players. Then pass in whatever direction, clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Rule 2: Only TWO Development Cards Max
Players may only have two active Development cards in play. When the next one is purchased, flip an active card over and rotate to indicate that it was used.

Rule 3: Hide Coins
Using Merchants & Marauders treasure chest. Players hide their coins and may look under the treasure chest at anytime.

Rule 4: Distant Sea Wraparound
When entering a Distant Sea, the movement count going in is the count that is going out. 
E.g. 3 Movement
A pirate ship is entering the Distant Sea near the peninsula and is in the space before the brown dotted line. Counting one going into the Distant Sea space and choosing another Distant Sea Space, the player moves the pirate ship past the brown dotted line and begins counting again having two more movements left.

Rule 5: Pirate's Home Base.
Ideas- Use Pirates Lair as a place to re-enter rather than Distant Seas. Pirates may not end their movement on that space. Navy may not use the Sea space at all.

Rule 6: Fifth Player- Navy
The role of the navy is to sink pirate ships indiscriminatory. Instead of players moving the Navy, the Navy player will move according to the movement card played. If the Navy movement gets modified through Development or Fortune cards, the Navy player may pick up a movement card in place of moving. The movement card may add to the Navy's movement in subsequent turns. The max hand limit is 2. Also, the Navy may not end their movement on the Pirates Lair.

5 or less: Return to the land whence you came.
6: Midshipman.
7: Lieutenant.
8: Commander.
9: Captain.
10-11: Commodore. (Average?)
12+: Admiral. The manifestation of justice. You are a pirate’s worst nightmare. They fear your name.
- This is for the 10 doubloon victory condition. If using 20, the amount needs to be higher.

Rule 7: Protected Ports
No fighting in ports. Safe haven for Merchants.

A very casual pick-up and deliver game that reminds me of a much lighter and faster Merchants & Marauders, which is a game I love, but don't play often enough. Black Fleet does not replace that game, by any means, but it's a nice distraction until those longer more dedicated game nights. My biggest complaint about Black fleet would be the upgrade cards, as they are definitely not created equal, and luck of the draw can greatly affect the winner of the game. Hopefully, since each player gets a handful upgrades, no one player will get all the best ones. Either way, like it or not, they will certainly shape your strategy.

Fun pirate game.  It is a pick-up-and-deliver combat game.  Great theme.  Light.  Although you attack other players, it's not overly confrontational since if you sink their ship it just comes back onto the board their next turn (a fairly minor setback).

Gameplay: each player owns two ships (a pirate ship that steals treasure and a merchant ship that is used for pick-up-and-deliver).  All players co-own the two military ships (which hunt pirate ships).  On your turn you play a card which allows movement of one ship of each type....you can also use any special powers you have unlocked.

Similar feel to Jamaica (another good pirate game).  Black Fleet replaces Jamaica's racing mechanic with a pick-up-and-deliver mechanic.  Recommended.

RATING: 6
This was a game which I had on my wishlist for a while in 2014, but lost interest in after reading the rulebook - I decided that it would still be a game I'd like to play, but not one worth spending my own money on.

This opinion has been confirmed when another of our gaming group bought the game, and we played it in May 2015 (still our only play). It's a perfectly decent game, and comes with some beautiful pieces for the ships. But it was neither especially original nor very involving, and in addition the game more or less forces you to attack the other players - this is of course a deliberate design choice, and you can't take it personally, but in this case at least it wasn't particularly conducive to fun, for me anyway.

There are some good things here, and I'd rarely outright refuse to play, but I wouldn't ever request it either.

05-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. Fun pirate game. Each turn, you play a card that lets you use your pirate ship, your merchant ship and one of the two navy ships. 

The game plays on a beautiful Island board. Your merchant collects cubes at ports and tries to sail to locations where those cubes are worth most. If your pirate hits an opposing players merchant, you take their stuff. If its the last cube they carry they're sunk. If your pirate ship can dock at a diggins space on one of the islands, you get money. The navy ships just sink (opposing) pirates. You use money to buy special abilities. If you buy your fifth spacial ability you win the game.

Fun game. To me, it's a definite game I would like to own as an intro game. It's about similar weight as Ticket to Ride, but in contrast to that game it features player interaction and it's way more gorgeous.

Some eurogame fans mind not find it deep enough, but Black Fleet does exactly what it advertises - take a couple of ships, zoom around a lavishly decorative board and pillage your friends' stuff. Options are always opportunistically tactical rather than strategic, but the card-driven play and the extra powers imparted by your tableau provide something to gear your play towards. Good, quick-paced fun with pretty components.

Well, it's a fun game and I like it more than other piracy themed games I played before ("Libertalia", "Pirate's Cove", maybe even "Merchants & Marauders") ... similar in gameweight and fun factor to "Jamaica". Awesome components!

Great game to use with newbies. Beautiful components, tbh some of the best I've seen. Need to play it again though, cause it's been a while.


Played it again and I loved every minute of it. This is imo, one of the best gateway family games available. Beautiful table presence, top tier components, good lenght, and solid gameplay with loads of replay value due to so many different powers. On and it plays great with two using Grey Elephant's variant.

(playtester) There may be issues with the power cards but the game is fast-paced enough for that not to be a real issue.  There is more strategy than initially appears, but there's also more randomness than people might like.
There's not necessarily a lot here for the serious gamer, but it's a decent pirate game, and there really aren't enough of those.  Then again, it was always better with the Kraken...

Black Fleet is a pirate-themed, pickup and deliver game with a little take-that added in. Coins gained from pirating, destroying other player's pirate ships and deliveries are used to buy upgrades and eventually win the game. 

There is a bit of a run-away leader problem with this game,  otherwise it's a decent game.

Весёлая лёгкая быстрая игра - смесь Серениссимы и Джамайки. Всё в игре такого жанра есть - и юмор, и отстуствие даунтайма, и красивое оформление. Возможно не хватает чуть большей сложности, но для этого есть другие игры в данной тематике. Ничего общего с Кейфлауэр. Если сравнивать с Серениссимой, последняя всё таки посерьёзней будет, да и посложней: бой, меняющиеся цены в портах на товары, расчет очерёдности хода галер и времени окончания игры.

A fun take-that game that never hoses you too much. Your sunken pirate always comes back into the game and your sunken merchant comes back at port with a load of goods. The only problem is that everyone starts to get so many special powers it's difficult to remember how lethal the board state is. For example, now someone's merchant can attack other merchants, pirates can switch spaces with the naval ships, pirates get extra gold for sinking loaded pirate ships. However, the game accelerates at a good pace as deliveries become worth more and ships move faster to deliver. Very fun time.

This is the pirate game for families, and a great lighter game! You've got all the great, simple elements here: pirates and merchants and navy ships, and you're able to control them to be able to get treasure in a straightforward way. You're working toward some special powers that add interest to what you can do and expand your options. The challenge, of course, is that the navy ships can also sink your pirates, and you've got to keep your merchants away from the other pirates. Sure, it's still a little chaotic, but in this case, it's the result of fun player interaction rather than just some random dice rolls (as in the case of the terrible Pirate's Cove). Also, you can change the difficulty with the game win card to make it easier for kiddos versus their parents.

RATING: 5.5
2 plays, prototype

The ships are pretty nice (though this is a prototype). Unfortunately, it turned out to not be as fun as I'd hoped: too random for my tastes, it lasted too long, and seemed somewhat unbalanced (if someone happens to get a good combo of special powers).

I guess I'll try it again in final form, but it doesn't seem like my kind of game.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
See [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1154808/]this Google translation[/url] for an entertaining and more complete summary.

A light game where players each have a pirate ship and a merchant ship, and also move one of the 2 shared Navy ships. Players start with a random set of VP cards (same costs, but with different powers when activated) and one I Win card (actually, I think it's the Governor's daughter?).

On your turn, play a movement card. This gives you movement points for your pirate, your merchant, and one of the 2 Navy ships; move in any order. Merchants are trying to go from port to port, delivering cubes for money. Pirates are sailing around trying to attack other players' merchants (earning some coins) and steal a cube (which they may later bury on an island for even more coins). The Navy ships may be used to attack other players' pirate ships (earning some coin). In addition, players may play Fate cards for a variety of powers (extra movement, move over islands, etc.).

At the end of your turn, you may spend coins to flip one of your VP cards. If you flip the I Win card (only after you've flipped the rest), you win!

This game is SO close to awesomeness that it's almost painful to not be adding it to my collection!  I love "pick up and deliver" games, I'm a sucker for great production values, and games that include a bit of a "tech advancement" mechanism tend to be fairly interesting, so this should have been right up my alley.  And the first impressions are extremely positive; though I wasn't initially sold on the cartoony visual presentation based on the preliminary images that were shown (it seemed a little too "French" for my tastes), seeing the physical version of the game is quite awe-inspiring.  The board is huge and beautifully illustrated, the plastic ships are likewise huge and carry the actual wooden cubes that they deliver (I LOVE that aspect!), the coins are metal, and the cards are presented in a whimsically fun style.  The game itself is super easy to learn and presents the players with some interesting decisions during each turn (and with the second play, I uncovered further strategies regarding ship positioning and blocking in relation to the board layout).  BUT... all that aside, the game lacked a certain depth that is necessary for a high replay value.  Even after just a couple of plays, the actions taken started to feel a little repetitive (though to be fair, the play time is short enough that a single game does not outstay its welcome).  I'd say that between the gorgeous production and the simple rules it would make a great family game, but the "screwage" factor is such an integral part of the game that you'd need to be playing with some fairly thick-skinned kids.  So while the game really is great in so many ways, I can't see the long-term playability maintaining my interest enough to justify the purchase on my very tight budget (unless an expansion were added to create a bit more depth).  Also, while this has very little to do with anything, the title of the game makes very little sense.  What exactly IS this "black fleet" that's referenced?  I played the black ships - was it me?!  So with much regret, I will not buy the game (even after a couple of plays I still want to love it), but I'd be quite happy to play it again!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  I was skeptical because it looked euro-y and dry but the game play was very engaging.  It ramps up as players begin to unlock powers and the tight board makes you push your luck in where you place your ships. The capricious nature of the powers are going to turn off some people but I loved it!

A good pick up and deliver game with some "Take-That" action in it as well. It's a great game, but I am not the biggest fan of Pick up and Deliver games. Overall, the components are amazing, and the gameplay is pretty smooth. However, I do feel that the game is too simple for my taste. Also, Sometimes it can feel a bit unbalanced depending on the cards you get, but that's not always a bad thing as it's all luck related and how you use that.

A great lighter game that works with family and little older children not something to be played over and over again but as a casual filller / family bgame its great.

Pros: BEAUTIFUL artwork, components and presentation. "Take that" isn't too bad and lots of overpowered abilities, so many that it oddly balances the game. Plays pretty fast.

Cons: Not the most exciting theme, basically just pick-up-and-deliver.

Final thoughts: Surprised how much I like this one. And seriously, it's got metal coins and ships that can hold your goods. The components are excellent.

Silly fun, thematic, a tad random. Like Camel Up, it's not usually what I like - or maybe I just like to tell myself that. It feels like a party game mixed with a euro (the merchant ship) and an ameritrash (the pirate ship) all rolled into one great package. But there are some important decisions to make, and a good 'knock down the leader' game that emerges in three player, although oddly still suffers a little from runaway leader - driven mostly by how the upgrade cards work.

Was like, eh not sure about this one when my friend first broke it out. Then later checked BGG and saw all the good ratings and Bleasdale and was like oh shit, I'm being an ass, I gotta try this one.

I love the SURPRISE unlock able powers, and they are almost always sick and OP and that's awesome. Except a handful of annoying duds which really make me frown. But, they push the game along at nice clip.

Otherwise, you just watch the game when it isn't your turn, and turns are not especially fast since three or four things must be done along with the playing of cards. And several times I just drew special cards just to get rid of the pointless special cards in my hand. My movement cards blew but gave me more cards which I couldn't use effectively. The first few turns, I enjoyed maneuvering strategically to protect my merchant, but once a few powers were in play, I just gave up and crossed my fingers.

It's a family game. Not for me.

This is what I wished Jamaica was when that game let me down.  A light-weight game that is creates a fun and quick game of running ships around the crowded ocean selling goods and attacking other players' ships. Obviously there is a lot of direct confrontation, but I never experienced any hurt feelings, stealing cargo is a big part of the game and most attacks people know are coming.  I wish it could fit more players, but a lot of fun!

Always enjoy this game when it comes out.  It's a beer and pretzels type of game with minimal strategy, but everyone I've played it with has enjoyed it.  It's one of my go to gateway style games since you can teach it in 5 minutes and it moves quickly and doesn't overstay it's welcome.

I have never played Merchants & Muaraders, but from watching game play it feels like a dumb downed version of that. I am looking to get M & M to try that put and see if I am going to be keeping this.

I got to play 'Blackfleet' last night, a game about pirates and merchantmen, with great looking doubloons although the ship pieces are a little too charictured, for me. Mark Evans intends to paint his ships.
The distribution of the cards can generate some very strong combinations like selecting the best moves from the two movement cards in play and adding four movement to a merchant man!
That said, I liked the 'Black Spot' option I had and the 'Royal Charter' one that allows three value goods to become four, the only reason I completed the '20' turn end card purchase last night.
I also enjoyed blowing up a fellow privateer, with the card that allowed my pirate ship to attack another whether laden with goods or not, although there was no puffing involved! Six doubloons for me!
Thanks to Dylan, Mark and Simon for the game.

This reminds me a lot of "Survive!:Escape From Atlantis". It has very simple rules, perfect for the youngsters...yet it can be deliciously mean enough to shake off the family game label. Play a card, move each of the three ship types and if you find yourself in range of an enemy ship, attack it. Gain some gold and buy a new victory card, which will unlock a special power to fuel even more attacks.

It literally takes 5 minutes to teach, but the randomly assigned power unlocks and Fortune cards provide all sorts of surprises and they make for an interesting game every time you play.

I don't want to oversell this. It's not a game for number crunchers or serious strategy gamers. But it is a game you can play with the kids and still feel invested, or something you can pull out as night cap after a long day of gaming. If you have ever played Jamaica, Black Fleet sits on the very same spectrum. Simple, fun...and just a little bit deeper than you probably expected.

Good "take that" pirate game. Expect to attack and be attacked. It is about pirating after all. If your looking for Euro friendliness, look elsewhere.

A true beer and pretzels game.  Sail around shooting each others ships.

Great production value and really fun overall package.  To me, it fills the niche that used to be filled by race games ( which this sort of is - a race to a certain number of doubloons).

It is not a game to take seriously, but pull out a bottle of rum and let the bad pirate impressions flow . . .

This game could have easily been a Days of Wonder game. The rules are simple, the game play is smooth, the artwork is beautiful, and the pieces are great. 

The basic premise is you have a merchant ship and a pirate ship and you need to earn money more quickly than anyone else so you can buy the upgrades and eventually buy the "Endgame" card to finish the game. Your merchants are playing a pick-up-and-deliver game, while your pirates are trying to take down everyone else's merchant. If your merchant ship gets to a port that accepts the goods they have, they sell them at that port's rate (between 2 and 3 gold per good) and pick up a new batch of goods. The pirate, on the other hand, attacks the merchant ships and earns two gold and one good which they can then bury. Meanwhile, there are neutral navy ships dawdling about trying to take down the pirates. If your pirate ship is destroyed the destroying player gets two gold. 

On your turn you have a few decisions, but it begins with picking a card (out of two) that determines how far you can move one of the two navy ships, and how far you can move your merchant and pirate ship. Also, you may earn additional bonus cards or have to discard a bonus card depending on the amount of movement. After that you can add as many bonus cards as you want and then go to town.

This game fits in very well with how Gen Con generally went this year: highly polished, easy-to-play games that are just a lot of fun.

Fun game. Big board with cool mini ships. Played it for the first time and won big time. I lucked out with special abilities that worked together. The cards I got from the deck were helpful too. Love the metal money, the art work and the ships that hold your cargo. I think the first time you play can have a lot of mistakes when playing the right cards at the right time. That happened with the friends I played with. Next time they will probably kick my butt. :)

RATING: 7
Excellent component quality (plastic ship mini's in different shapes and colors, metal coins, great artwork) in this fast-paced family game. Supports 3 or 4 players only, which is a little unusual. Considering the size of the board, I can only recommend this game with 4 players. With 3 there's just not enough interaction. I'm keeping it purely for the component quality and the fact that a lot of people in my gaming group enjoy it.

Chaotic sea battle filler to deliver merchant goods and take that with pirating and steering the course of the Navy ship. Race for gold to unlock abilities. Not entirely, but reminds me of Loot the board game.

A simple and beautiful, light game. Its a good gateway game, but with some strategic choices that many gateway games lack. Might get a bit too random in the end, and the strategy cards dictate a lot of your strategy. But if you take it for what it is, its a nice game.

A great gateway game with over the top production values from Space Cowboys. Completely Amerithrash as there's variable player powers and ship to ship battles. Turns are over fast enough that you don't really feel the downtime. Plays best with 4.

Light - Fun, but there wasn't enough action in my first game. I thought that ships were going to be sunk all over the place. The reality is that you play like 15 rounds and maybe sink or steal items from ships 4 times. Okay only.

RATING: 6
A lite family game - not even light, too many letters - designed by diehard Steve Miller fans. You know, space cowboys.

Most pirate games suck one major way (at least) and multiple small ways.  This one is decent all the way around, which puts it near the top of the loot heap.

I painted small faces on every cube to highlight the fact that goods are inevitably infested by rats and roaches, apropos for the time.

Pretty good pirate game. You have a Merchant and a Pirate ship which you have to move around. There are 2 neutral Navy ships that you can move. The game is quick and easy but has enough strategy for hard core gamers. There is some luck but it fits the game. The action ramps up as you unlock more powers and it all works good.

A quick-playing take-that game with terrific components.  Simple rules with easy to read cards, but plenty of interesting gameplay as you create combinations of cards and special abilities.  The game builds to a race for the finish, making the play time feel shorter.

Like: Theme, Card systems, plastic pieces are awesome, metal coins are more awesome.

Dislike: A bit on the Chaotic side, some people were simply overwhelmed by how busy the board could be at times.

I have to say, I really enjoyed this game.  A fast pick up and deliver game with a take that you scurvy dog feel to it , that will have you laughing, cursing like a pirate. Always willing to play it with 4 players. 3 players just didn't work so well.

This was a lot of fun. Clean rule set. Nice graphic design and presentation. Would gladly play again. Rating will probably get higher with multiple plays. The variable powers add a lot of replayability to the game. Some powers work very well with other powers to create some really fantastic power-combos. The game doesn't overstay it's welcome, so even in last place, you can still have a good time.

I liked the components and the core mechanisms of the game a lot. Besides that I failed to see the overall strategy of the game. I managed to win with only the pirate ship and some upgrade cards. It looked like trading would be key in the game but apparently unless you can grant your merchant insane movement ability, you basically are the prey of your opponents' pirate. I think the game was fun but I won it having basically zero idea about what I was doing.

This, like Lords of Vegas, seems to bring out the dark side of the gentlest of souls. They can live out being evil, ruining others' plans without concern about what we'll think of them. Sadly it only plays 4 and the group that most loves this is usually 5. Sigh.

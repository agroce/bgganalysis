Rules set heavy, not on the basics but on the player aid charts, modifiers and OOB.

Setting up with miniatures or with supplied counter sets makes a lot of difference on the overall play and feel of the game.

Lots of work to prepare for a battle that takes but shorter time to complete.

Overall a great experience and satisfying feel to grand battles of the napoleonic era.

Best miniature game system. Operational game, which is the only scale for miniatures I like. Let's you simulate the great Napoleonic battles in it's totality. Other miniature systems look at detailed regimental combats which NEVER gives you the real big picture. Realism is included into the system more than all those hardcore painting maniacs would let you believe. I remember a game with 10 players and one of us only had two small guard divisions. Battle began at 10 AM and only on 18 PM he launched his attack on the Allies. Two corpses broke and the man behaved like the emperor himself. What a game experience.

RATING: 4
Original game and modules provide lots of scenarios to play, but the game scale (very large) makes it feel kind of inflexible.

Absolutely my favourite Napoleonic miniatures wargaming system. Even better now that NB IV has just been released :-D

http://www.napoleonsbattles.org/

There were a couple of dubious rules in the old version (such as it being too easy to blast infantry out of built-up areas with firepower), but these have been fixed in NB IV. NB IV also, amongst other things, introduces some cool new, but optional, "attributes" to handle slight variations in the make-up of the brigades (such as having negative mods for there being militia mixed into a line brigade; or positive ones for a high proportion of skirmishers, or better mounts in a cavalry brigade, etc.)

Yup you need lots of figures, but the system represents Napoleonic battles very well at the grand tactical scale at which it is pitched (and which is where I prefer to see them); and there are lots of battles in that era :-) some of which are smaller and more manageable, before moving onto the big ones, which are better played by teams.

RATING: 8
IMHO the best set of Napoleonic miniature rules.  Although not free of problems, the rules make an attempt to bring the more rigorous rules of hex-based wargames to miniatures.  Because each unit represents a brigade, ENTIRE Napoleonic battles can be recreated on a (large) table top.  This game is a compilation of years of gaming experience from two very knowledgeable designers.  Lots of great detail, if this is what you are looking for. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
realism is not bad,but very long to play because units are brigade so for a medium battle like waterloo count approximatively 40 units to manage so it's more than 10 hours battle.lot of figurine to paint

Bought this for $5 at Toon Con 2015.  Unpunched!  There's a ton of value in this box.  I'm sure 2 people could play this for a full year.  I need to find such a person first though.  Miniature wargaming.  I have no experience with this genre, BattleLore is as close as I come.  It says it's suitable for solo play as well.  Cardboard punchouts, minimal map board, and 3 rule books.
An Avalon Hill Bookcase Game.

The best set of Napoleonic rules by far. They need a lot of miniatures but allow proper battles to be fought with command rules that distinguish them from other sets that I've played.

This actually got me into miniature$. It is a relatively easy game (of course, I also play ASL) and very interactive. In regards to realism, there was a Napoleon and he did fight battles. He did have command of infantry, cavalry, artillery, & subordinates. Beyond that....

I am an avid fan of this period and can state unequivically that this is an unrealistic game! The game mechanics reward extremely unhistorical behavior and it even resurrects the Panzerbush syndrome!! The fire combat results always make it more possible to get two casualties instead of one.

This may indeed be a fun game, but there are better rules (some even easier). Try "Napoleonic Command" (easy but hard to find) or "Valmy to Waterloo" (The ASL of Tactical Napoleonics)

BTW, I would seriously consider other titles before basing my miniatures for this system. Whatever you do, do NOT base cavalry four to a stand. Split the stand in two and put two per stand!!!

I'm much more of a board gamer than miniatures player, but I actually found this to be a very good miniatures system.  I even painted up some figs to play this one.  It's playable (enough to learn the game) with the counters that come with it though.

Bought some 20+ years ago, but haven't really played it. Quickly glanced over the rulebook with a friend of mine. Consensus - really should read the rules through and play few games, minis from Battles of Napoleon should fit just fine instead of the chits.

RATING: 7
A good grand-tactical napoleonic game.

It allows you to play a complete battle in a day. Realistic mechanics and provides a 'realistic' challenge for the commanders.

I think that Grand Armee and Grand Armee Fast Play build on the legacy of Napoleon's Battles. Still a good set of rules and a great experience.

Napoleonic miniatures rules system.  Very playable, but some aspects of the rules raise a few realism question marks - stuff like flanking bonuses, oportunity fire, etc. are not in the rules and probabaly should be.  Brigade level miniature systems are not generally favoured among the established hobbyists (they paint regiment by regiment and want to play that way as well) but if you've got extra figs, or are looking to start painting, and you want to play-out entire battles (or just keep the rules manageable) N.B. is worth considering.

Brigade level Napoleonics, not my favorite but has a few qualities, namely more people play it. Prefer Old Trousers II, a free battalion level rule set- awesome with a few mods.

Almost silly. Any game that uses opposed die rolls for ranged combat has/had a lazy designer. Game didn't have the feel of a Napoleonic Battlefield, and suffered a bit from the "Unbeatable French Army" syndrome (not fatally, though).

The fightingest set of Napoleonic miniatures rules ever. The games don't drag. My only complaint is the opposed roll of D10s. It allows too much swing. I think opposed rolls of 2D6 each would be better because it averages the result.

A clever new engine-building game.  It has a little of the [b]Bohnanza[/b] feel with building bean fields.  Building on others though is inventive and quite mean!  I would've given this an extra point if I didn't spend so much of the time squinting at the tiny icons across the table.

RATING: 7
To some extent Xanadu is familiar and rather boring territory of assembling different sets of resources to build buildings.  Its use of double sided cards - one side a building, the other a worker - is scarcely novel either.  However, it does offer a couple of things I haven't seen before.  The first is that the degree to which you can replenish your hand while taking an active turn is dependent on selling one of your buildings to the Khan.  The other is that we are all working together on this building project and so I can place my workers to gain resources from your buildings. Doing so also alters the price the building can be sold at. These two features combine to make this not at all a common or garden engine builder; your engine is constantly being dismantled.  Instead, Xanadu is a highly tactical game of making the best of what's there now and of managing your hand to minimise the number of turns that you need to pass in order to draw back up to seven cards.  It almost goes without saying that in such a tactical game there are no strategic depths to explore.  Further plays will determine how much that bothers me.

Production quality is OK.  I found the card art rather nice, while the distressed look of the box was not to my taste.  There is a lot of information on each card and the icons are fairly small, so don't try to play this across a huge table.  The English rules are a little lacking in clarity.

RATING: 7
This one's a mixed bag.  Overall, I found it to be an interesting little card game.  I liked the mechanism.  I found it quite clever and relatively unique but, as a good friend of mine observed, it's a bit chaotic and hard to plan a strategy because there's a lot of luck in terms of people's needs being influenced by card draw.  

Our first game was a four player game.  It dragged a little because the iconography of the cards isn't that clear and you have to scan all of the cards on the table looking for what you want.  The card quality also isn't the best - you really need to sleeve these cards.  I can't imagine it with 5 or 6 - that could just be pure chaos.  This one might blossom with 2-3 players.

BTW - I disagree entirely with the reviewer who said to avoid the rules.  The rules are very clear.  There are typos and grammatical errors, which clearly come from someone for whom English is clearly not their first language, but I found them concise and easy to understand.

RATING: 5
Xanadu is a "card building" game of some note with "dual use cards" mechanics that have little or no relationship to what is, in truth, a completely pasted on theme, and it seems, pasted on resources.  Light bulbs and tea cups for resources to build buildings?  

This is "complex card gaming" for the sake of "complex card gaming," which in fairness, does have its appeal for certain gamers who want to play a game designer's idea of a complex card game.  I am just not in that intended audience.  

On the other hand, there are far worse card games than this one, and some gamers may be new to the idea of using cards to build buildings, that then, give you points, a mechanic that, by itself, in a themeless game, is simply no longer enough to hold my interest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clever card game with simple rules and good strategic depths. Cards are at the same time buildings and workers. Workers can be used to take resources from your or other players buildings or to increase or decrease the value of your or other players buildings. You can force sales of buildings you don't own or your own building. Pretty unique mechanics, never played a game like this before.
Will love to give this a 8 but the cards look so ugly...The box is dope though.

RATING: 9
(About the 2015 edition)
This game is not getting the attention it deserves. Behind the apparent little card game is a deep brain burner construction game. 
There are constant choices and interaction: using a card as a worker or to be build, then use it for resources only, or to be sold, or both, with the possibility of using other players buildings and them yours of course, those actions changing the building values, wisely choosing when to sell, when to refill your hand, etc.
So many ways to go with a hand of cards that I wouldn't advise to play with 5 or 6 players, keep the number as low as possible and avoid AP players at all costs. Great 2 player game.

In short, this will please many gamers who like heavy management games.

Continuous fiddly resource inspection makes planning tedious. Much luck is involved through card drawing and the ways to influence this are minimal. The obvious way to keep opponents from scoring is placing workers at their buildings. But the times you want to do this are situational and often hurt you more than help you. Gives the impression of a simplified 7 Wonders style of strategy, but without the fun.

I forget how I found out about this game, but added a copy from CSI on a recent order. It's a multi-use card game where you must either use your card as a building or a worker on either your own or your opponent's cards. By covering cards with workers it also changes how much value the card is worth when you sell it for money, which is what you need to win the game. The only downside is I don't feel like the decisions on how to use your cards are that tough, and it is definitely better with more.

Written review: [thread=992804][/thread]

The goal of the designers was to create a good [b]worker placement[/b] card game to reduce publication costs so that the game could be published entirely in their native Colombia. Being a card game, Xanadu also incorporates [b]card drafting[/b] and [b]hand management[/b] mechanics. 

One of the really cool aspects of this game is that it plays quite differently based on the # of people and with your gaming group. I love games that take on the personality of your group. If people stick to themselves, then it will be a fairly friendly game. But, if you got people who love forcing conflict, then this will be a cutthroat affair!

This game MUST get more publication and notice here in North America! (And beyond)
But, for now, you can get this game by geekmailing Javier here:

He visto el vídeo de la explicación. Parece una mecánica interesante pero creo que va a tener más interacción entre jugadores de la que me suele gustar. Valoraré tras jugarlo.
Edito: tras una primera partida a 3 jugadores, he de decir que no es mal juego pero no he disfrutado mucho la partida. Básicamente te limitas a intentar optimizar tu mano en el momento, ya que debido a la gran interacción que tiene, no puedes hacer nada a largo plazo. Aún así, es rápido de jugar y puede valer como compás de espera entre juegos. Creo que es mejor juego cuanto menos jugadores haya, a más de tres debe de ser incontrolable totalmente.
Edito: tras una partida a dos jugadores el juego es ameno de jugar y está bastante competido.

Interesante juego...me gusta bastante el sistema en que sube y baja el valor de los edificios, y en especial la gestión de recursos para pagarlos, ya que se cuenta con recursos de sus propios edificios al igual que el del resto de jugadores. Sin embargo no es un juego que me guste jugarlo con 3 o más jugadores, ya que la mecánica hace que al construir un edificio de mediano o alto valor, los demás jugadores sin duda van a bajar sus cartas para devaluar su venta, así no necesiten los recursos de esos edificios. Sin embargo creo que es un juego en el que se equilibra y se ve su gran potencial cuando se juega de a 2, ya que un jugador no puede dedicarse únicamente a bajar cartas para dañar el edificio al otro jugador, porque va a quedar con poco para poder jugar.

Pensaría que si hubiera una variante en la cual un jugador no pudiera tomar más de 1 o 2  recursos por jugador, se equilibraría más, se haría más estratégico y se jugaría más a construir sus propios edificios que a jugar a dañar lo que tienen los demás...para el caso en que se juegue con 3 o más jugadores.

Por ahora creo que es un gran juego y lo disfruto realmente cuando lo juego entre 2.

RATING: 5.5
This game very much suffers from competition with the rest of my collection. It has two interesting aspects: timing, and dynamic balancing among the players.

The timing aspect is reasonably engaging. It seems like you are trying to set yourself up to play a large building when your opponents are low on cards, and therefore unable to sabotage it out from under you. Setting this up can be tricky, because people will almost certainly be trying to do the same thing to you. You are therefore stuck in a situation where you succeeding also gives your opponents ground to make a move in.

The dynamic balancing is something I always enjoy. Someone at the table scoring 7 points is bad for everyone else, so everyone else is incentivized to mess with it. However, screwing with someone's building just for spite is normally a fairly large investment, and can leave you drained for your own turn. Therefore, it's best for you to try to pass the buck to the next person down the line, and hope that they bite the bullet and do the work for you. Doing so runs the risk that your unwilling associate gives you the game equivalent of a middle finger, and builds their own building while letting the original player get away with 7 points, scot-free.

That all being said, these are systems that are present in plenty of other games that I own. On top of that, Xanadu's underlying mechanics are not stimulating enough to make me want to play it over something like, say, Chicago Express. I will likely try it a few more times, but so far, I'm not convinced.

I will say that I do enjoy the art and design quite a bit.

RATING: N/A
An interesting game. At first it seems sort of solitaire puzzle-y, as you focus on your own cards and try to figure out ways to sustain a chain of selling cards for points. Then you realize you can be aggressive, using only or mostly your opponent's buildings for resources. Neat. Played with 2 and 3 players so far and it worked fine.

Excelent card game, the players build cards that have resources in it that all players can use, but with each use the cards can improve, stay the same or be lowered in it's price. You have to decide when to use your own cards to raise it's price when to sell your cards and when to use other players cards in order to lower their market prices.

I like this game a little more every time i play it.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2012)

Full disclosure: I am a friend of the designers AND I won the game in a lottery event.

This is the first game I play that was designed and developed here in my country (Colombia) so I’m very happy about it and I wish the best to Azahar Juegos. I hope they continue to publish more games.

So far, I have played Xanadu only once. This is a light card game but with some interesting decisions in it.

First of all, the theme is paper thin but the mechanics are quite good. I like the fact that you need to manage your hand, you can play each card as a building or as a worker, so you need to balance this. The rules are very easy to teach and the play time is relatively short.

My main concern has to do with the high VP buildings (yellow and green ones), they are very easy to sabotage so when a player plays them, all other players will try to screw him ASAP without regard to their own tactical situation. I mean every time they were played in our game, we sabotaged them no matter what resources they gave us, otherwise, the player who played them would win very easy. I feel this is an auto play with no strategy whatsoever which I don’t like. This whole situation led me to think that, perhaps, they are not worth playing or you need to play them just before the game ends but I need more plays to properly see if this is an issue or not.

For now I will play again Xanadu soon and I’m happy that games are being produced in my country :D

With more plays I found another issue with the game as was released. The last player has an unfair advantage as the game end immediately, in our games the last player ALWAYS won due to this. I think that Javier (the game designer) already addressed this issue. He also proposed some variants.

I’m downgrading it’s rating because nowadays I’m much harsher with my critics (I’m doing this for a lot of games). Xanadu is an ok game and I’m very proud it was produced in my country. I can’t wait to see their next game.

I have a confession to make. My previous ratings about Xanadu were biased because I felt bad giving a bad rating to a friend´s game and one for which I never paid anything. In fact I have won three copies of the game and I have sold each one of them.

All my previous comments are true, however, I’m changing the rating to one I feel the game deserves. It is true it has interesting decisions, however the game is broken IMO because the last player will win no matter what (perhaps this is fixed now). Also I dislike the auto-play when someone plays a yellow/green building (all other player sabotage it whether if gives them what they need or not) I feel the game lacked some playtesting before release. Still I don’t think I will ever play it again. It is way too light for my current tastes.

I feel bad writing this, but it is also liberating as I always felt I was lying to the public, and that made me feel even worse.

I'm fond of this kind of card games that use cards in a multifunctional way. On the con side the scoring/resource production system attracts potentially a lot of take that. Graphical layout is quite tight which makes following others' tableau a bit hard and with high amount of players this can be quite low on control. On the other hand with lower player count this can easily be a boring exercise of rinse and repeat.

Didn't worked for me as much as I expected (so far). The mechanic is fine, but it does not feel that you have much control and you should hope that everything goes fine until next turn that you can sell your building. However I can see that it might be possible that after more plays the strategies becomes more clear. The problem is "if" it succeeds to come to the table more...

Remarkable interaction between players but I found some issues I dislike from my first game of Xanadu: 
- It seems you will always depend on to other players to do something (what you can, rarely what you want).
- Very difficult to see one of your plans succeed.
- Since it is necessary to keep track of every player cards I find symbols need to be larger in order to make the game easily playable.

Jeu assez tactique. Difficile de planifier hors de son tour de jeu - contrôle partiel de la situation car pourrir le jeu adverse peut s'avérer doublement payant. Mécanique intéressante. Interface un peu difficile à lire - beaucoup d'éléments à observer et le tableau est continuellement changeant. Un brin trop chaotique. 

Le timing semble crucial. Dans ma seule partie jouée (3 joueurs), j'ai obtenu du succès en réussissant à planifier "quand" poser quelques gros édifices à gros pointage (vert) alors que mes adversaires avaient très peu de cartes en main. Évidemment, tout aurait pu être différent si les ressources disponibles avaient été autres.

[b]Xanadu[/b]

[i]This has been on my radar since the Carson City KS because I am a sucker for tableau building games. We played with the full player count of 5 and even though we were learning and things were rocky at first the game actually moved in at a good clip. This is a game that I think is easier to teach as you play, the rules sound convoluted if you try to explain all the interactions, but once you start playing everything makes sense. 

There is a lot of interaction for this type of game because you can play workers to cover u other peoples locations which will net you resources and quite possibly cost them VP. There is a gradual progression that takes place in this game as you eventually start to get rarer resources and can build some cards that will net you a lot of VPs. You really need to watch what other people are building because most cards actually become worth less if you keep placing workers on them for resources, so timing in this game becomes important. After one play I am eager to take another crack at it, unfortunately I don't think the 2p game would come close to a 3+ player game. There is a variant to play with 2, but I'm no longer interested in picking this up because I can't imagine getting this to the table with any frequency with 3+ players. So as it stands RftG is still my tableau builder of choice and now that we just got Xeno Invasion we'll be playing a lot of Race.[/i]

For some reason, I had a hell of a time parsing the rules to this one. While the gameplay is not difficult, it was a chore to figure out this game just from the rules. I'm not even sure if the "2 player variant" is a variant or if it's actually the 2 player rules. A lot of ambiguous language and less clear examples.

I'd like to sit down and try this again because the first game of it we called about 10 minutes in after being quite confused as to what to do.

In this game you get a hand of cards, and what you are looking to do is manage to play your cards, and then have them last long enough to sell them for points. Each card requires certain symbols to play, and you collect those symbols through having cards sitting in your tableau, or covering spots on cards in front of any player to take those resources. At the cards get covered, their values shift either up or down. The game requires you be very careful not to bump your cards, and you have to pay close attention to the tiny icons on other player's tableaus. The high flipluck is a problem here and I'm not sure what this game does better than any similar game, other than perhaps incentivise you to punch the person in last, due to the way the point values go on the cards that player was unlucky enough to draw.

An interesting card game, fairly short playing time.

OK to play once, but will not be rushing to play again anytime soon.

A game imported from Colombia. Customs investigated the package thoroughly so there is a cut and a hole in the box.

This is a nice worker placment card game with a high level of interaction! It is really cool to play. I really like the artwork.
During play you really have to look good what goods there are available, so that might take some time. The real fun is in damaging the precious buildings of the other users.

Great game! Recommended!

This is a very slick card game. I really like the way you can play on your own buildings to increase points and also play on your opponents buildings to reduce their points as well. Cards in hand is another resource you have to manage and try not to run low on which will limit your options. There's really a lot to like about this game. A good amount of depth with a fairly simple rule set.

I found the English 3rd edition rules that came in the box to be dreadful - particularly errors in examples and lack of examples. Apparently it's just me - the reviewers are saying the rules are easy. I gave up after spending half an hour trying to decipher them. Onto the next game!

A very exciting game to play. Combining elements from different sources, Xanadú manages to be a game of strategic depth, player interaction and resource management. It is by far my favorite three player game so far.

I loved the game. I think it offers a perfect balance of casualness and serious play.
I find the concept of using the reverse side of the cards very cool, I like the fact that you can choose to mess with other player's buildings but at the price of your own victory.
I wish the stock quality of the cards and the tong baos were better.

We really enjoy euro games so this was a no brainer and it is a great choice.  I really like the complexity of the game with the cards having so many uses and the challenge is figuring out how to use each card to your best advantage.  I also like that it has the high level of complexity without all the little bits that most euro games have.  While I still like those games, this is a nice one to pull out when you don't want a long setup and/or you want a portable game to take with you.  I also like that it's not too long of a game.  Really looking forward to sharing this game with my friends.  This is very novel and innovative game.

a drafting/hand management/worker placement game (!!!) with multi-use cards.

i'm not sure what i think of this. it is almost too clever for its own good. a card can be a building or a worker. you can use a building to generate resources or sell it for money (essentially VP). the more valuable resources a building generates, the less money it can be sold for, which creates some interesting tension. you have to decide whether to cash in while the price is high, or lower the cost to get resources for an even better building. you can also hurt your opponent by using their resources and devaluing their building. resources for new buildings seem a bit too scarce and the game almost has a little too much going on. this is a game that i feel like could be GREAT with a bit more development. Koi Pond: A Coy Card Game is another game that i feel is just a tweak or two away from greatness.

A friend got this game after meeting the designer in USA. Soon after the first game I found it as one small gem with a clever vision of handling a deep game only with cards. It is always a pleasure to play it and I think it will be reprinted soon with some improvements.

Interesting mechanic of placing cards to trigger persistent resources allowing you to fill contracts. There were some wonky rules limiting your ability to refill your hand.

Slightly swingy and random with 4 players; I'd like to try this again with three, or perhaps even two. The end game also felt a little disappointing, although that may have been a player just tanking the ending as they couldn't win.

An interesting premise, certainly.

Is it a 10? In the world of card games, if it's not, it's sure close - Wanting to play more, yes this is a must have for anyone that enjoys any kind of card game - it's easy and strategy, yes.

This is a neat game with some unique mechanics. It's a card game where cards can either be buildings or workers. You sell buildings for points. Some buildings flat out give you a virtual good on a turn. If you need other goods to build something else, you can convert cards to workers and put them on anyone's buildings to get a one-time benefit of whatever happens to be available on the open slots on those cards. But putting workers on cards changes things. Sometimes it let's the owner start producing virtual goods. Sometimes it changes the value of the card, up or down. And if you fill the last slot it autosells the card. That can make a difference as you only get 1 card a turn if you build or play workers, 3 cards if you sell (but not if someone autosold a building) or you can refill your hand to seven by passing.

This is not a game for the AP prone. You have to keep in mind which cards are in your hand that you want to try to build, which can be converted to workers, what cards cost to build, which cards produce goods, both automatically or upgraded, which cards you can play workers to in order to get one-time resources, how many points cards can be sold for and whether you need to try to upgrade them to either improve their value (your own presumably) or upgrade to trash the value (others). And that's not just for your own buildings, that's for everybodys! So it's a lot to keep juggling in your mental space, and it requires constantly rescanning everyone's buildings and keeping track of what gets played and what get upgraded and what the currently available resources are. It's a lot going on.

I rather liked it. It might be better if I had a better idea what all the cards were and which ones did what.

Card game reminiscent of the mechanics of Caylus and maybe Neuland. You draw cards randomly into a personal hand (yuck), and can build those cards as buildings (provided you have the resources) or deploy the cards as workers to (anybody's) buildings. Resources are either passively granted by a building to its owner, or are possessed in the act of placing a worker. In other words, you can't stockpile resources. Any resources you claim via worker placement need to be used immediately to build, or you lose them.

There are substantial side effects to placing workers. It can unlock "passive" resources for whoever owns the building. It can adjust the selling price of the building (generally upward for production buildings, and downward for buildings that are essentially for VP: money has no use except as the VP measure). A building can sustain four worker placements, each one with different effects. Once a fourth worker has been placed, it is automatically sold off by its owner.

There is not really long-term strategy or game state (aside from accumulated money/VP). You draw what you draw, and build or sell as you are able and as seems to make the most sense. I think there is a lot of room for short-term analysis, but it can be difficult as the game has 10 resource types and each player usually has at least a few buildings in play.

It ends up feeling repetitive, also comparable with Caylus (esp. in the Magna Carta form) or Neuland. No easy fix to that, I think. There is enough randomness that the game needs to be long in order for skill to prevail in picking a winner.

Overall I initially rate it 7, the same as Caylus and Neuland. But it's definitely more interesting than Caylus Magna Carta.

Worker placement where your buildings, workers and resources are cards and there is a high degree of player interaction (the hurt your opponent kind). Impressive execution of mechanics. The symbology on the cards is also very well thought out and doesn't repeat often. This makes building very difficult, which is part of the fun. It can also create the problem where you run out of things to build but then you revert to start game conditions. The only problem with a lot of players is it can get a bit AP, especially with people who tend to AP. Can't seriously imagine playing this with 6 unless the players are experienced gamers who can play quickly. Scales very well. 2 or 3 is probably the sweet spot here.

Card game, where workers are added on top of cards. Anything you build can be hit by other players as the point value often decreases when worker is placed on a card.

Most of this game you have seen before. Collect resources, trade them in to build buildings that then generate even more or better resources. It also has a bit of a Race for the Galaxy or San Juan feel, since you will usually have to discard much of your hand of options in order to collect those necessary resources. There's a wrinkle here though. Unlike those other games, this game has loads of direct and mean-spirited interaction.

The only victory condition in the game is the cash earned by the players. You only earn that cash by selling your buildings, the same buildings you need to generate the resources for future buildings. So very quickly you enter a decision space where you have to balance current needs with endgame goals. In fact, the main conceit of the game is that most of the buildings slowly grow more powerful the more often they are used to generate resources. Do you let them develop over time to their maximum effectiveness or do you sell it off early and cash out for maximum value? 

The obvious strategy is to let them grow at the beginning of the game and cash out at the end, that's where the big twist comes in. Most of the buildings function as precariously balanced one-way teeter-toters. When they hit maximum value, they also produce massive rewards for any opponent that wants to "loot" them. This makes sitting on the sweet spots incredibly dangerous, turning the game into a more push-your-luck experience, with no guarantees that the other players won't hit a juicy building and tip it over into worthlessness.

It's a simple game, but a thinky one nonetheless. I was pleasantly surprised by it and intend to track one down for my own collection.

A pretty cool little building game - a bit like Uruk, but not really.  Very tactical (as compared to strategic).  You are just making the best play you can every turn - most likely you'll be hosed out of whatever long term plan you had.

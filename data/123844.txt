I like the ideas behind this game including once around auctions for the privilege of taking certain actions in a round, buying parcels of land, spatial considerations in terms of building certain buildings, and a somewhat fixed economy.  Yet, the game itself is not quite fun enough for my tastes.  It reminded me somewhat of Power Struggle and Neue Heimat, two games that I might prefer to play over City Hall.  Still, there is a side of me that thinks that this game might get better with future plays.

Wow - bought this overlooked gem for $15 on Amazon because I had read some intriguing things about it.  Well, I was in for a surprise. After a bumpy start with the instructions, the game fell into a smooth rhythm, and two hours later, I had a new favorite in my collection. City Hall is great! Ugly but great! At $15 it's a steal. There are areas that could be improved, but there's no arguing with the feelings it elicited: excitement, tension, laughter, and woe. In other words: fun.

2014. 2-4p. 90 min. Bidding and tile pl... auctions ontop of auctions... Everything's an auction and you need to decide who to take money from when they have exactly the same bids (who's you're favorite?).

Surprisingly quite a good game. I was skeptical at first because you bid for EVERYTHING in this game, which I thought would be a real drag. Well, actually it is a horrible experience, but not to the detriment of the game: it just means that game decisions are very difficult, and sometimes miserable, but this is made up for by a tight, exciting game whose tension lasts through the final turn. 

The interconnectedness of each part of the board is very tricky to grasp: you need influence to bid for actions, you need money to buy plots and public approval, and you need plots and public approval to score points. But you also need plots to make money, and you need money and public approval to gain influence. The end result is a dizzying web of interconnected forms of income and scoring possibilities. Usually not my kind of game, but a very well-designed one nonetheless.

I'm not a giant auction game fan, and City Hall just didn't have anything that excited me to separate it from being just another ho-hum auction game for me.

There is some interest here in that you're bidding for roles that allow you to do stuff, and all of those roles interweave and interact with each other in order for you to get things accomplished.  I did find that part to be interesting and well done, but it was just that none of what I was trying to accomplish seemed all that interesting to me, and many times players just had to sit on the sidelines waiting to have influence to simply bid with.

I'd play this one if everyone else really wanted to play, but I'll be ditching my copy since it's not something I'd actively choose to play.  One of those games that is mechanically solid, but just lacks the fun for me.

Need another play to get a good opinion on it.  The first play was a blowout.  One player got ahead with stars and we could not real him back in.  He doubled all of our scores.  So I'm a bit worried about a runaway leader.  But since it was all our first play, we could have made some mistakes...such as letting him get 2 Manhattan housing permits next to one another.

Update: ok game just too dry to rate higher.  Once you get a lead...hard to be reigned back in.

This is a game of managing your influence.  It is everything.  We played a 3-player game where one was familiar, and two - including myself - were new.  However, I quickly caught on that hoarding influence was the key to doing everything you want in the game.  I'm not sure how normal this is, but I won by 30 points, so I felt that perhaps something wasn't quite right.  However, exploring this more, it seems that the other newb didn't quite get it, and the experienced player was simply off that game.  Score was much closer the next time around.

The appeal is in trying to chain effective actions in spite of the Goa-like, closed system auction where the auctioneer gets the fee. Sure, you can win one action but now you've given your opponent the currency he needs to beat you on the next one, so you have to figure out what to auction just to get influence (currency) and what to auction because you really want to do the action. Taking turn order is something you actually have to win like the other action auctions, so you have to plan when to burn a turn just to do that. I liked trying to find my own tempo and squeeze through while putting my opponents into the frame of "let's you and him fight!"

Some of these actions lead to a) buying land and then b) placing buildings on the land you own and there's a city-building element of adjacency that I found a bit underwhelming. Nothing wrong with it, just wasn't exciting, and players were able to max out on their adjacency benefits such that placing a factory -- which should be detrimental -- was neutered quite easily. The whole point of placing buildings is to build up the number of "stars" on your properties to use in probably the most important action of the game whereby you gain population for having the most stars. Population is one of the two factors multiplied at game end to give you a score.

The actions are fairly straightforward means to get more influence (for bidding) or money (for property and other things) or land/buildings, but population seems to be the key. The winner had 5 x 20ish(?) population plus some endgame bonuses for 140 points. I had 4x14=64 plus 40 endgame bonus points (the most endgame bonuses of anyone), so next time I'll be sure to fight for population more. Hey, my people had a park to frolic in (picnics!) and another player had a tower (nice view!) but the winner rode slums to victory, heh. Because houses provide the most stars (and they lead to population gains which lead to endgame X times Y scoring), it's hard not to feel the need to focus on them. Don't get me wrong, I liked the game, but I just wish it weren't so tilted into the importance of population.

An auction game: players are auctioning off actions in a difficult once-around auction. It's very tricky! The scoring is largely based on a multiplier, so players have to pay attention to both sides of that equation.  Tense & not too long. 

I was a playtester for this game for several years, and it's really made me appreciate the importance of graphic design; it seemed quite opaque to me until I saw the final board, when suddenly I was able to understand the game well and play much better.

* Kickstarted! *

Choose the action that will expand your control of territory within New York City -- but beware: after you choose it, the other players have a chance to influence who actually performs the action (so it may not be you, the person choosing!). Gets frustrating when your opponents keep doing the action you really want to do BUT, strangely, there are so many bonuses and scoring opportunities that you can rally fairly well to a balanced score in the end (and maybe a victory too).

PLUS: theme, quality of components
MINUS: you can lose the action you want on your own turn

Fairly generic Euro building game.  Lots are acquired, people bid for roles, one competes for acquiring the most stars on one's buildings by exploiting combos with adjacent buildings and there are bonus cards for having the most of a variety of different objectives/statuses.  Never seemed to have its own unique  mechanism that had not been done elsewhere.

Uninteresting strategy. One-dimensional play. Asinine bidding. Limited variability. Nonsensical endgame conditions.

MSRP of Scoville is $ 59,95. For City Hall it's also $ 59,95. I can't imagine why, as most of the box is filled with air and you only get a board, 4 sets of meeples and some cards.

The game itself is OK. But with 2 it will be extremely boring I think (haven't tested it yet), with 3 it's OK and 4 seems to be the true shining number for this game. But again, like Scoville, there is nothing new here: buildings that increase or decrease in value according to the types that are put next to each other: seen that, done that. The bidding system: nothing new, seen it before. Scoring system: multiplier, so increase each factor of your product, seen that.

Not that it doesn't work, you can't say that, but it becomes a bit too repetitive near the end to stay interesting.

I hope that Captains of Industry will provide me with a different feeling, because otherwise Tasty Minstrel Games seems to become the publisher who puts out mediocre games that don't add anything new to the games who are already out there.

Rating is tentative after one play of a prototype.

The game appears to be a really nice role-selection game the combines the money exchange found in Modern Art with the role selection found in Puerto Rico and similar games. Players select roles, but the role selected is auctioned off using the 'influence' currency in a once-around Modern Art style auction.

Like many games of this type, I had to work to figure out what I needed to do to win, and I spent a lot of the game trying to get a lot of the wrong thing.

I've committed to this on Kickstarter. It's a game I'd like to see published, and I'd like to play it again.

Edit -- I got the Kickstarter a few months ago, and I've played this a couple more times since then.

It's a good game. It feels a bit like Goa with the auctioning of the power. 

Money feels like it's next to worthless, but maybe I'm approaching it wrong.

I've moved my rating from 8 to 7. It's good, but not great.

It works well enough, and it had its fans in the game I played, but this isn't a title I'd be requesting too often. The auctions weren't as painful as I thought they would be, but the overall game is a bit dry. The game lacks a bit of glitz - too cut and dried.

I liked the auctions themselves where you can keep a rival's influence cards, and the scoring system brings up some interesting strategies where you need to optimize your money, influence bids and buildings, but like Suburbia, it just doesn't feel much like city building.

An unexpected treasure.  Multiple types of assets to pursue which interact nicely but which cannot be all gained makes for interesting and diverse strategies.

My only criticism is that the trackable hidden information is (a) pretty easy to track, and (b) very important to track.  Normally THI doesn't bug me too much, but this type make the end game unsatisfying.  Next time, I'll simply play with influence (and maybe cash) public or try to find a way to inject a small amount of true hidden info.  A minor criticism of a strong game!

I am glad I was introduced to this game. A friend has been trying to get me to play this, and I finally consented.  This is a fun game.  The art and the design of this game are really boring and doesn't really reflect the amount of fun in the game.  This is definitely an instance where you shouldn't judge the game by its cover or board.  The gameplay mechanisms are fun. The game really uses a different approach on auctions but makes the game more interactive. I only imagine I might have a tough time getting this to the table since the theme and the components are not really selling the game. I was glad I played it but unless that friend is back in town, it is not likely to get played again.  I will still make every attempt to get this back to the table

1 play, 4er (3 newbies)

My rating: 3? But I might try it one more time
Game quality: 6+ for people who like this kind of thing

It's auctions, auctions, auctions! Also, a bit of negotiation if you want to convince someone to take your '3' bid instead of that other player's '3' bid! I don't mind _some_ auctioning, but do not really want a game that is primarily an auction game -- I am terrible at them! And here, bids might go to other players instead of the bank (like Traumfabrik, for example; actually, more like Goa) so you have to be REALLY careful about these transactions! If you don't manage your currencies (influence, money) well, you can sit there at times with nothing to do. There is some interesting role selection and tile-laying stuff going on as well, but not enough to make this a winner for me. 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
[u]Setup[/u]
The board shows 3 boroughs of New York, each as a (boring, ugly) grid with one connection to each other borough. Players start the game with 3 influence and $20 (?), then draft (sort of) 2 spaces each: will place their meeple in those spots to mark ownership. They also each have 3 building cards: factory, tower, housing; place one on the board in one of your spaces, one in your hand, and one at the bottom of the building deck. Player tokens also go on the population track (1 space) and Approval Rating (1; multispace track max value 5, each value with several spaces). A star token goes on the marked space on the Approval track (according to player count).

[u]Start of Round[/u]
- skip this phase in first round of game
- if a player token or the star token are at the end of the Approval track: go to End of Game.
- earn one influence from bank

[u]Your Turn[/u] 
Choose one of the available roles to auction off: bid with influence, once around, 0 minimum, may duplicate previous bid, auctioneer bids last and must accept one of the highest bids. If win yourself, pay bank; otherwise winner pays you. Roles do a variety of things:
- get money (based on your pop, towers, factories)
- get influence (based on your approval rating; may also buy for $10 each, or sell for $7 each)
- increase approval rating (1, 2, or 3 for $0, $10, or $30)
- increase pop (based on your relative ranks in star tokens on all your buildings)
- acquire land (draw random from the deck, or pay $1 to select specific lot); the 2 unchosen lots are sweetened by adding $5 to the spaces
- acquire and/or play buildings: when you play to board, update the star token status of all adjacent buildings (generally there are +1 or -1 modifiers based on what kind of buildings are nearby; each building type has a max number of star tokens allowed). For each 
- become start player next turn

[u]End of Round[/u]
After all players have chosen a role:
- update the turn order if someone chose Deputy Mayor
- add one influence to every unchosen role
- players take their meeples back from the role spaces
- go to next round

[u]End of Game[/u]
- auction all 7 roles, in order shown on board
- do an additional scoring for your stars (with no role-based modifiers) to award population to players
- award end-of-game Endorsements: 10 VP ("votes") each for meeting a variety of conditions (most towers/housing/factories/parks, lowest approval, most money, most influence, most land, etc.). 
- earn votes (VP) = Approval x Population
- most votes wins

Interesting bidding system. The one initiating the bid can match the highest bid or accept a bid from those who bid the highest amount. Many choices to be made. Sometimes it's smart to select an office you don't even want to gain influence from bids for future bidding rounds of offices more important to you. Then again it could mean the office you want isn't activated at all this round.

Not recommended for only 2 players!

Keeping track of star values sucks. I'm thinking of making a special board where everyone's total is clearly visible at all times, without constantly calculating it after changes.

I was apprehensive starting to play this game, but I found the designer's description of the game intriguing enough to try it out. While we were playing, there were several people watching, who also got interested. There is a lot of thought in the design to give several paths to winning the game, so different play styles can be accommodated, and definite replay ability. I had a lot of fun.

I added my support to the Kickstarter as soon as I could.

Each turn you choose an office and everyone bids to take that action. You can take the high bid and let that player have the action or pay equal to the high bid and take the action.

There's not enough corruption, political dealing, and it feels like its all about bidding.   Also there isn't much of a catch-up facility and population never seems to go down.

Keller's recent game Captains of Industry totally blows this game out of the water for me.

1st play - the actual game here is a simplified ticket to ride, with cool minis and more kid friendly art. The scoring system is more complicated than I'd like but my 7 year old seemed to do ok with it

A bit of a surprise this one.  GulliPiratten looks like a kids' game and my reading of the rules did nothing to dispel that notion.  Play cards to move pirate critters along three ships, when one is installed in the captain's spot there is a division of treasures among the crew members.  The object is to collect sets and the bonus or enabling tiles that go with them.  The game's interest lies in the special abilities of the various critters and how each can best be used to achieve your aims and thwart your opponents.

I found the sewer pirates theme amusing and well implemented.  The artwork and miniatures are rather nice and overall production quality is excellent.

Initial Impression: The components for this game are simply wonderful. The cardboard is thick, the minis are wonderfully produced. The game is simple enough to teach and the kids enjoy it. With the addition of character powers, I can see that many tactics can be employed in order to win the game. With the short playtime this will be a good game to play before the kids go to bed. I really need to paint the minis.

This is a fantastic light Euro game and the best pirate themed games I have ever played. It also has some of the best cardboard bits around. The tiles are like an inch thick!

RATING: 7
The pieces are well crafted and the concept is fun.  The only problem I had with it was that I felt like the game was over before I had a chance to do hardly anything.  We resolved the issue by adding a third pile in front of each boat, and then the game seemed a lot more fun and allowed for a lot more strategy.

Pretty bits give it a bit of a ratings boost, if I ever play it again (I use the term loosely) it'll probably drop a point.

Didn't do it for me at all - this is a euro through and through with a pasted on cutesy theme. Decisions are rather obvious and there is little control. Overall game experience was a mix of bored, frustrated and just wanting it to end.

Can see why others like it, I don't. Much prefer to play Pirates Cove if there is a desire for a light pirate themed game ...

RATING: 9
Played a couple times and was quite taken with it - simple, lots of good choices, a good mix of tactical, press-your-luck, and auction elements. You need to get lots that are valuable to you, but you also need to do it efficiently, and you need to leverage special powers. Lots of good stuff in a compact package. I found the theme, while not an immediate selling point, actually rather engaging (helped of course by the great sculpts). We'll see about replay value, but this is the rare game that grabbed me quickly and which I was excited to play again.

RATING: 6
This was a pleasant surprise! I had thought it would be a pretty bad game, and even though it didn’t take me by storm, I liked it well enough to give it a few more plays. The fast play time surely helped about how I feel about the game, because if it had taken 15 minutes longer I probably would dislike the game. But for what it is and the amount it takes to play, this set collection game does offer some interesting decisions! 

I liked the variety of the different animals and I could definitely see different strategies be implemented according to which animals are available in the game. I liked how you should boarder the three boats and how you try to climb up to be the captain so you get first shot at the best tiles and the bonus tile. What I didn’t like was that you can get screwed by some blind drawing if you need a specific card, but I guess that’s true for any game. I would definitely like to play it again, probably with 4 players as there would be more competition on the boats. 5 is probably too chaotic, but I guess I will find out later because I’m not turning this game down until I’ve played it a couple of times more.

Man, people are hard on this game in the ratings! No idea why. Great components, really fun to play, the art is delightfully cockeyed (one of the pirate boats has a Barbie with her hair cut off for a figurehead).

Great game to play with a s.o. or someone who is newish to the hobby or for the end of a game night when you're all too fried to take on something heavier.

I like the timing aspect of choosing which boat to jump on with which guy.  I even grudgingly like the fact that becoming captain means you miss your next turn sailing the ship.  I'm just not sold that at the end of the day it's all that fun.

Very good game mechanics, 3 different variants that make it possible to play with young children with basic game rules (without loss of gameplay interest in my opinion).
First variant is like a new difficulty level in terms of rules as it gives every character type a distinct ability. In basic game every characters are identical.
Second variant is adding a recruit step at tavern (relevant only if playing also with first variant). It makes playing time longer but is quite fun to play.

Does the world really need another set collection game? In this case: yes, because it still felt fresh. Important is that you're playing with advanced rules, this means the miniatures have special abilities which are the salt in the soup/game, fighting for the captains place. As there are basic rules / advanced ones and an expert auction I feel the game scales very well to different target groups. The fun and also some turn angst it creates makes it a "Spiel des Jahres 2012" contender. I just wished it had another theme, sewer rats are not that likeable. A bit short for what it is (I always wish that game would continue for one or two turns to extend my set collections).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Nice family game with cool miniatures. The special powers of the different animals are interesting, but they are very unbalanced. There is some variance as, each game, you either use four of the six animals or auction crew members. You are jockeying for position in three boats, trying to collect sets and match different items, but it may be hard to get what you need and your plans will often be frustrated. This may lead to somewhat random outcomes, given the all-or-nothing scoring of some items. I eventually sold my copy, but I could have kept it if the game came in a more suitable small box (it's even a bit larger than the standard Kosmos square box).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An easy set-collection, card-driven game with 4 different types of pirates. The production of this game is amazing. The miniatures are great, so are the graphics. This looks really, really nice!

However, the game is more likely a family game, but a pretty good one. There is luck involved, but it's not dominating the game. I would say it fits perfectly. If you want a nice looking and good family game, you can stop searching right here.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (October 2013)

Gorgeous game with great art and production values. The game components are very nice and the minis are very detailed. It´s a shame the gameplay is so shallow.

On the good side, great components, easy to teach, short playtime, it has a lot of replayability because each time your characters are different.  The theme can appeal to some (not to me).

On the bad side, it is way too light and has way too much uncontrollable luck. The decisions are obvious, if you can’t make them is because you didn’t have the correct set of cards. 

Bottom line, a game that doesn’t appeal to me in the least (way too simple), however it can be a fun game to play with the family or non-gamer friends. I won’t buy it. Perhaps if we played it in draft format of with different teams the rating could go up to a 5.0

Arrived, artwork is great and it will appeal to the kids greatly. Am really looking forwards to playing this with them at Christmas. Rules are simple enough for them to pick up, and offer enough gameplay for adults to enjoy it as well.

First play and i have to admit surprise, this is not just a game for kids. Way more decisions than you might expect. A nice little purchase and one that will get more play.

I have passed this on to a friend who will get more from it when played with his children. Its a quality game that i am hoping to get to play with them :)

Players compete in deception and tactics to fill the best positions aboard the three pirate frigates. A pirate's rank determines his share of the expected loot – but even the best crew ain't worth nothing without their talismans. Each of the three frigates has its special fetish, and no pirate would dare to board her without the matching talisman for fear of terrific calamities.

Happy to play a friend's copy from time to time.  I would be curious to try the auction draft in the future to see how much that adds to the game.  The different powers of the six miniatures were a clever twist to a set collection game.  I was frustrated that the player to my right never really gave me much to work with in my first play and I couldn't seem to break the vicious cycle as I always seemed unable to get into captaincy.

(4 plays)  Here you play a team of rats, bugs, and other vermin sailing the sewers collecting tasty and valuable garbage.  But you really want the BEST garbage.  What are Fries without Ketchup?  What are Burgers without an old nasty Malt?  What is a Can of Beans without a Can Opener?  What's a Teddy Bear without a Parrot to translate what it's thinking.....?  right.  That's Sewer Pirats.  That's "Pi" "Rats".  Get it?

Your hand of cards plays similar to "Ticket to Ride" in that you draw from a deck with face up cards to get the symbols you are looking for.  The turns are super-fast, as you get only one action per turn, and there aren't many different actions to choose from.  We played the landlubber variant to learn our first game, then added all the special powers for the vermin in our other games.

Ultimately, it's a set collection game, where the garbage tokens (points) are worth more if you match up the right sets and get a bunch of the same ones.

It is a fun family game with a cute theme that was easy to play.

Kind of cool.  The minis and theme are very good, but the game is basically just "place a tile, move a tile, score a ship."  The special abilities and bidding to acquire certain pirats seems a little contrived and tacked-on, but I get why they did it.  I think this game just suffers from trying too hard to be both a family game and something gamers would play.

Also like the advanced rules, random teams or team auctions.

I like this game a lot more than I expected to and have to thank Richard Ham for his overview for clueing me in on this one.  The game is fast and very cool.

There could be a better way of picking teams than those offered, but once you're rolling, it's awesome.

Very quick tactical game, which could almost be played as a filler. Best with 3, still okay with 4, with 5 too chaotic. In all my games the weasel (two actions at once) seems a bit overpowered and messes up many tactical (i.e. defensive) considerations.

Jogo bizarro, num universo de fantasia, habitado por uma data de animais de reputação duvidosa, cujo objectivo é saquear os despojos da humanidade contemporânea. Miniaturas bem detalhadas, suportes de tecnologia recente, tokens robustos e uma jogabilidade acessível a todos, tornam notável este "infiltrado" dos jogos familiares, visto que criações com este tipo de temática costumam ter um grau de complexidade muito maior. Merece uma olhadela séria!

I like the interaction, the racing against other players/characters, and the strategy (which often does not go as planned, lol).  I also like the theme - it is not-so-serious and the whole game works well with the theme.

The first game (learning curve) took almost 2 hours to play, with 3 players. The second game was 90 minutes. The scoring rules are important to understand up-front, because they determine your strategy.

I never use the auction to choose your characters. It is just easier to randomly pick from the "tribe" cards.  All the characters have good abilities, so any team has a chance to win.

This game feels like a completely unfinished idea.  There is potential here buried under a mountain of really clunky, obtuse gameplay but what comes in the box is really a frustrating and unfun experience.

The game is a rummy-style card-matching game much in the same vein of Ticket to Ride.  Each turn you collect 2 cards either from 4 face-up or a face-down draw pile.  If you don't collect cards you can discard them to place one of four different creature pirate figures on a boat, move one forward on a boat, or set sail on the boat.  Setting sail collects 1 or 2 of 4 face up tiles.  3 of the tiles are square and provide points...maybe.  The captain gets to collect the circular tile which either boosts the point total of all square tiles of a particular type OR unlocks the point values of certain types of higher-valued square tiles (which is why I said maybe).

There are a couple of nice things in this game.  The figures are cute and well-produced and some of the theme was entertaining.  I liked that the square doll tiles could only be turned in for points (ransomed) if you also collect a parrot because parrots can talk to humans.

Outside of that though this game was a MESS!  First of all, there are only 3 boats which accounts for 3 different cards you draw.  You are doing rummy/card-matching wrong if you only have 3 different types of cards in the deck.  Would you play Ticket to Ride if there were only 3 different colors of trains?  No?  Then don't design a game that uses the same mechanic with only 3 different kinds of cards.

The actual gameplay is so clunky too.  You have to turn in 1-3 matching cards to get on a boat.  Then turn in a number of cards to move forward a number of spaces, skipping over occupied spaces, and if you are the captain you have to set sail with your action.  There is only one captain space though and with the random distribution of the tiles that means there is almost definitely a most needed/valuable boat.  Which means if you go later in turn order you are fucked.  I started my play of this going last and never got to be captain because the boats I needed to get on had a captain before it got to my turn every time.  I could ignore those boats and pursue others but then I would lose anyway.  Especially when tons of tiles offer 0 points unless you unlock them with others.

Finally, they tried to inject some interesting gameplay into this crap factory by providing up to 6 different figures.  You can draft these to make up your crew but for our first game we all played with the same cast of characters, makes sense.  However some characters are far and away better than others.  In my game almost everybody used one character (the weasel which lets you take two actions instead of one each turn) 99% of the time and ignored the other 3.

I would avoid at all costs.

A fast playing and fun game of competing for the best position to collect sets of items.

Sewer Pirats is a miniature game, which is destined for nice family play. Its an easy strategy, where you have quite lot of options and several paths to victory. Each race has different skills and there is another loot in front of each ship for your men. For these gathered tokens, you get points at game end, but only in case, when you have collected right combinations. Therefore you have to not only send your men, but also pick the right ships, which are interesting for you to seize. Game excels with perfect processing. Although the box recommends game from 14 years, its not quite right – you can play it with a ten-year old. And it will still entertain more advanced players. Sewer Pirats is a pleasant and goodlooking fun.

A nifty little set-collection game that plays quickly, has an engaging theme and cute miniatures.

About [thing=102898][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=102898][/thing] is a light and quick set collection mixed with hand management game. In it, players have 4 critters as crew, and use them to get the best possible spaces in each of the three ships, in order to obtain the best booty - the Captain of the ship will take the first pick and the special treasure, and the others in the ship, will, in order, take the rest. It is mostly an abstract affair, not a truly thematic game.

[thing=102898][/thing] offers three modes of play: the basic one, where the critters don't have special abilities - works best when teaching the game or playing with kids. The simple landlubber variant, in which every player will get the same crew - now using the special abilities of each. And, finally, the crew member auction variant, in which players bid for critters in order to make their unique crew. Of course that, for more seasoned players, this last one is the way to go, even if it adds around 10 minutes to the duration of the game, as people having different crews is much more fun.

The game comes with some 30 good miniatures (not awesome in detalis, but very nice for a game that isn't truly a "minis game") and the overall graphic design and art is well done, being both pleasant and helpful to easily tell things apart - however, I had some confusions with people mixing the Ferrets with the Rats or the Weasels, but their poses and sizes give enough clues to separate them, except for those truly distracted.

In the end, [thing=102898][/thing] worked very well for us, allowing for some smart plays, constant decisions, light interaction, all inside a playing time of under one hour. A good surprise. 

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Once the set up is done and every players has a crew (either by simply taking one, or bidding for one) of 4 critters, there will be three ships and, in front of each, the booty, composed of 3 normal treasures and 1 special. Each ship has 4 spaces, one of these being the Captain space. Now players, in each turn, will have four options of actions:

a) Take 2 cards. This is like Ticket to Ride: there will be 4 open cards. The player can take from the open cards or blindly from the draw deck. They can mix also, taking one the open and one from the draw deck. After taking cards, if the player has more than 6 cards in hand, she must discarded until 6;
b) Move a figure to a crew space in one of the ships. To do this, the person discards cards of the type of the ship, putting the figure in space 1, 2 or 3, depending on how many cards were used. A critter can move, freely (usually), above another - say I move my Rat in the Fish ship, using 1 card. There is already a critter there, a Slug, in space 1. Therefore, my Rat go to space 2, passing the Slug;
c) Become Captain. To do this, a critter must have all spaces between it and the Capitain space occupied or having no space (if in the position 3). Then the player can use a card of the ship to move the critter past other critters, or simply moving from the 3 spot, to the Captain space;
d) Set sail. When a ship has a Captain, the player controlling that Captain, in her turn, [b]must[/b] set sail. The Captain take the special tile and one other. Then other critters on the ship take, one each, a treasure tile. It a critter on the ship didn't took a treasure, it remains on the ship, advancing one space. All critters that took a treasure, live the ship. After treasures are taken, the next batch of them, which was already revealed, it brought closer to the ship - it will be the next treasure. Then a new batch is put, showing what will become available next.

Critters, if playing above the basic level, have unique abilities: like the Rat take 2 booty tiles; the Cockroach walks one space for free; the Racoon takes one card from someone passing above it when moving; the Toad can choose to not take a treasure tile and, instead, remain on board; and others.

Once a ship doesn't have treasures in front of it, the game ends. Treasures will be scored in different ways: some will score no matter what, while others will need special tiles to give points - like, Canned Food can be worth a lot, but each Can requires a Can Opener, in order to score. Some special tiles will give bonus points for each of its connected food - for instance, Ketchup will give 5 extra points for each tile of French Fries; and Chilli Pepper will give 4 extra points for each tile of Chinese Noodles.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Mostly will be about which cards to take, which ship to enter (and advance) and with which critters, and which tiles to take. Nothing too big or difficult, but the decisions are constantly and matter.

The decision of which ship to enter also can have a more strategic depth, since there are usually two sets of treasures in front of the ships, players can see what the next bach will be. So maybe it can be best to enter in a ship, not to take something now, but to be in a good position for, later on, becoming a Capitain, to take an much needed special tile.

If playing the the crew bidding, then is also important to decide which critters you want to add to your crew, as the special abilities of each critter can be key in doing well in the game.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Very good production value, both for the tiles, bases to separate the critters owned by each player, and for the miniatures themselves;
- Easy to teach and to play, with enough depth to be interesting for the whole duration of the play;
- Moves quickly, ending in a properly sized frame of one hour or less;
- Scoring is smart, making every tile be relevant - the ones with lesser value, have the best special tiles, and also will surely score, while the ones with big score, might not, and have the smallest bonus;
- Three ways of playing are good to allow it to be played with people with different skill levels;
- The insert is useful, and even fits the cards with sleeves.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- The box could be smaller - around 20% smaller, for sure;
- Plays best with 4 - in smaller numbers, there is more control and less chaos, but some critters become under used (like the Toad and the Weasel); and with 5, the games ends so fast, and one lucky haul can decide everything;
- The theme and aparently childish art probably worked against the game.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Not truly like in a sewer-sea pirating and getting the Capitain's cut. As I mentioned, [thing=102898][/thing] isn't truly thematic: the theme is just added colors. It could be about merchants in the renaissance - a topic not fully explored so far, by the way. It could be about spaceships, or in a post-apocalyptic world. But it is about pirates (pirats) and critters. Ok.

The feel is that of a procedural game, in the vein of a [thing=9209][/thing] or many other euros. You will have a distanct feeling that what you are doing have a sense according to the theme, which is nice. But don't think you will feel the tang of the urinated sewer waters in your face and the warm poopy breeze in your sails. Hum, that is propably a good thing.

Anyway, [thing=102898][/thing] does what it meants to do well - a fast and good set collection mixed with hand management, able to the taught and played under one hour. It can work for family playing time or in more "serious" game nights, with the fellows, using the crew bidding variant. Still, in both cases, while providing interaction, [thing=102898][/thing] isn't an agressive game - once a critter is in the boat, there is no way for it to lose its spot, for instance, and even if there is no loot for it, it will stay on the ship, now one space above. Sure, there is some "cutting" regarding the Captain spots, and in the taking of treasure, however, you will also be doing, not just receiving, and there is basically no bash the leader here (nor there is a catch-up mechanism).

[thing=102898][/thing] is a friendly and smart option of a game for a that times you want to compete, but don't really want to be mean or too confrontational.

Is was surprise to like [thing=102898][/thing] as much as I did, considering its overall rank, but it serves to prove that there are plenty of good games hidden around.

After reading the rules and watching some video reviews I was afraid that this was going to be an OK game - just unremarkable. But my first game (regular ruleset) was quite a pleasant surprise. During play you get to experience some surprising situations due to the interactions of the characters' special abilities and player actions. Once you have an understanding of these interactions, you will regularly experience some turn angst. Good with two players (best with 3 or 4), in which case it can be played in 30-40 minutes (after explaining the rules).

Provisional rating, one play (first skill level). Good fun, needs thought but not too much. I admire the breadth of audience, kids to gamers, permitted by the set-up options.

Lighthearted fun.  Quite procedural, with a smidge of nastiness, and wonderful bits.  Seems like a perfect game for younger gamers.  Beautiful sculpts and silly-yet-dark animal theme will appeal to adolescent gamers and those looking for a cute experience.  The game itself is quite chaotic, yet not so long that it will get overly frustrating.  It's just short enough to make you want more, which is exactly what I'm looking for in a game like this.

Beyond the cute theme and nice animal figures, there's a fine game of jostling for position and exploiting your crew's special powers. It's essentially set collection and there are six different crew creatures, each with a different ability that can help you get the items you need to score the most points. In our plays, everyone had different opinions as to the value of each crew member, which made the crew draft exciting and affected the strategies that players used during the game. Although the draft adds a bit of time up front, the game doesn't outstay its welcome and there's reasonable replayability thanks to the variations between crew each time.

This is not so much like the kid game it may look like. There's a good amount of strategy and tactical play hidden under the fun veneer of a light family game. It can even be a bit of a brain burner (or perhaps "anguish machine" is a better term?) among gamers.

The Crew Drafting rules of the expert game, make it even more of a filler for gamers, and distances itself further from being a family game. I love how you recruit the sewer vermin from a seedy looking bar, consisting of the reverse side of the three pirate ships. Speaking of the components they are all top notch!

By the way, for any Swedes out there, we dubbed the game "Kloakpiråttorna" in Swedish.

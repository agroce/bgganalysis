An enjoyable game that can be played either quickly or with a lot of concentration. I prefer the former, although we all struggled at time to make up our minds. My strategy of building lots of influence in one brewery, and then pushing that one into three other pubs paid off quite well. I'm not sure if my opponents would let me do that again though. It's a clever game, and one that definitely rewards repeat plays. I hope I can continue with this one.

Fun game, good mix of actions, fast playing too. Paydays are kinda slow. The Drunken Bum and Pretty Waitress are key...And it about BEER!

Along with RoboRally, this is a brilliant game to play drunk. Sober, you can be paralysed as you calculate your expected revenue and analyse risk. However after a beer or two the level of mental arithmetic required is slightly over what the inebriated brain can accomplish. This leads to players following their instincts, with hilarious consequences.

This is generally a good game, but with the wrong crowd it can fall flat.  If all players are playing to win, it works out great.  If one player is playing to screw the others over(with no interest in winning) it becomes a nasty, nasty game.

{2 plays • 4 player} First I was liking it, then I wasn't... and now, after some thought... it's okay.  I like the streamlined business aspect - sort of a economic-lite game - but I'm bothered by card luck causing leaders *too early* in the game. (I have no problem if this happens later in a game, when, in theory, you may have used your skill to set yourself up for this "luck").  Mind you, most of us were newbies and kind of let the leader happen, but that brings up another nit of mine: games in which ALL players must pay attention and balance.  Also, I didn't like the single cube removal upon 6th card thing.  I can see how it creates tension, but it basically hit the players who were behind, so not only were they trailing, but they got unlucky, too.  Bad feelings all around.  Still, I'd play it again, maybe a few times... but after that, I suspect my rating may drop and I'll be done with this slightly different, mostly okay, not quite my thing game.

[initial rating: 6] (1 play later) Indeed, I've dropped my rating down a full point because AGAIN the luck of the cards created a runaway leader early in the game.  Even if further play will teach us all how to combat this, I'm not sure I'm interested anymore.

At its heart, this is a game of majorities.  But like many things involving beer (and lots of it) it can turn ugly if in the wrong crowd.  The game can be more brutal that expected.  While space in the beergarden may be seen as the key, it is actually the stocks in the bars and breweries that drives how the game will play out.  If the game is played lightly and in the spirit of sharing a pint or 2, expect to have some fun.  If your in a fiercely competitive group, expect the game to play out like rival bars slugging it out at an all-night boze-fest.  A good game but with the right crowd.

First Play: This is a game where the deal of the cards is pivotal throughout the game. At the start your initial hand is crucial. Get some unique placements and you are off to a cracking start, find yourself struggling in the same spot as other players and you will be up against it.

As the game continues there is the bluff/ guessology of trying to establish what the others will opt for. Fans say this is where the skill is. Being a hard nosed realist I'd say that this is where the only free will kicks in. If you guess a unique action, you have a double turn or a cheap card, find yourself the same as the others and it costs you dear.

Whilst the game is such an abject dire lottery I was unable to derive any enjoyment out of it at all. A very untidy chaotic experience, never to be repeated.

Pretty mathy economics game where you buy stock in pubs and breweries to make the most money. Allthough at it's heart this is an abstract game the theme does make sense. Just enough randomness in the game to keep the players from calculating every possibility into the extreme. Lots of back and forth for control of the companies topped of with second guessing because of the simultanuous action selection. Easy to learn and fast game with surprising depth.

Allthough I liked the game. My gaming group did not. If you have nobody to play with the game has to go. Traded it away.

I really like the bonus a player gets for choosing a unique action.  Someone in my group called it too random.  I don't see it that way.  It is about adjusting to a fluid situation while doing what you can to stay in a better situation.  It is not a game for people who prefer to plan every move four or five moves ahead.

I ended up trading this away because we just didn't play it, and I was never really in the mood to suggest it or try to explain it those who hadn't played.

Fun game.  There appears to be a lot of little factors to watch going on during gameplay.  But, so long as you pay attention you'll have a pile of fun.  The only drawback is that you need 3 or 4 players, no more, no less.  Good I suppose if you have  couples that play games, and you like beer...

okay based on 3 plays.  For some reason, I like these psychological games where you have to guess what the other guys are doing... and try to do something different from them to get a bonus.  The rules are not terribly complex.  lots of luck, but many tense moments.  if you don't have majority control of any breweries, you'd better have a solid 2nd place in a few of them or else you're going to get hosed by players changing contracts at the end.  the game is probably better with 3 players (instead of the full allowance of 4 players) because there are only 4 breweries and the game seems to go poorly for the 4th player if he gets locked out of the breweries.  my most recent play annoyed me because clumped cards caused fast locking up of 2 breweries and 1 or 2 pubs.

Only played it once, but I must not have been in the mood. I found it very fiddly and prone to analysis paralysis. Will definitely have to try it again, though. I find the theme oddly hilarious, and the beer wench token even more so. Not sure what put this on my husband's game raydar, but he picked it out (which is funny when you know that he doesn't like beer).

I hate, hate, HATE this game.  First game I played I simply disliked it. Then I gave it another try, and realized that turn order is HUGE. The only way to score is to have many cubes on the board, and the only way to get them is using the "shares" action. The other actions are eventually useless if you don't have enough cubes to keep Boss power and/or most cubes in an area. 
The Shares action strongly favors the first player, who is the only one with first choice of the cards currently showing, others get leftovers or random card. 
In the first "week" I had to wait until the 4th turn to get this first player advantage, and by then others had already gotten more cubes into the spots that the cards came up for. Then each of the other players got another first player advantage and we scored before I got to be first again. So I scored low and didn't have enough money to buy many shares. Adding in my poor luck in which cards came up, I never had a chance.

A really excellent share dealing game set in the beer gardens of Germany (where else?) during Octoberfest. The really clever idea is that you invest in both the beer gardens and the breweries and getting the right combination of both is the real trick.

I like this game, but you have to make sure you use the correct rule for moving the barmaid and the bum around.  The English rules have a *HUGE* error that allow you to move them anywhere you want.  The correct (German) rule is that they only move clockwise.  It makes a very big difference.

I really like the profit-splitting mechanism in this game - half to the shareholders of the brewery, half to those of the garden with the bosses getting all the remainders. There might be a bit too much luck in this for me to love it, but I think it beats Acquire as my go-to game for easy-going shareholding game.

I really like that the game comes with completely extraneous coasters.  That's like a full ratings point right there.

Unfortunately, the game itself didn't seem to work quite as well...or at least just didn't feel that interesting to me. The theme, while interesting, feels extremely thin. Not even the buxom beermaid can save it.

The choices I'm making aren't so bad. But the rock-paper-scissors nature of the action selection makes for a type of chaos/guessing that works much better elsewhere (like Hoity Toity). Too much of the outcome of the game depends on psyching out your opponents (or rather just dumb luck) in choosing actions that give you more to do. Also, the three available actions are dynamically valuable. Towards the early and late parts of the game, only really 2 of the actions are reasonably valuable to do. 

I'd be willing to play again, if someone really desperately wanted to, but I doubt it happens. Nothing really memorable here except the coasters.

RATING: 6
Goldbrau puts players in the role of investors with a finite capacity to invest in the 4 breweries and 6 beer gardens on the board. In essence, gardens are more lucrative to control in terms of being able to affect the board, as the garden size can only be expanded by the player with the boss token and the beer supplier can similarly only be changed by the person with control of said garden (and of the brewery as well). You can place your boss any place where you have at least 1 cube invested and where the current boss does not have an absolute majority of cubes, so there is some room for back and forth, though spending too much time on that can be bad and options for taking control can dry up by the late middle game as the stock cards for each location are sold out and singleton investment cubes are eliminated.

The trick to maximizing income is that there are 6 gardens and only 4 breweries, and at the end of each round sequence the gardens all have to split their income with the brewery 50/50. So theoretically you could win by not playing to the gardens at all, though in practice it is difficult to maintain a strong income without sway in at least 1-2 of the gardens as that is the only way you can actually influence the shape of the board which is where that base income number comes from to begin with. Even with a strong brewery presence, even 1 brewery outside your orbit could become the major supplier to up to half of the gardens, so you cannot completely specialize and be successful, or at least it would take some rather interesting circumstances for that to work.

It must be said: much of the game hinges on making sure that you are maximizing your cuts by having a large enough influence in the big beer gardens and the breweries serving those gardens, but ultimately a lot of the time your ability to influence that will come down to what comes into the card pool and where you sit in the turn order for buying cards as the ability to gain influence is pretty limited. What this means in effect is that you have a game that is pretty gamey in terms of min/maxing and scoring, but which has a pretty large inherent randomness. Good play can certainly help your score, as being smart with how you expand the gardens you have influence in, and how you play to your current board position can certainly add a lot of points to your score. That said, beyond that, there is a very big random factor inherent in the way cards are dealt with that players are going to have to accept as part of the package. This also goes for the movement of the busty lass and the drunken bum, as late token movements can also swing things pretty dramatically.

Overall this is a pretty fast paced medium weight game with an entertaining theme...my only real complaint is that the mathy scoring turns off the casual and the randomness tends to turn off the heavy gamers. I like it, because it has some fun, gamey decisions and plays very fast for what it is, but a lot of it does seem to turn on what cards come out when, so I understand why it has found a limited audience.

I'm not one for stock games, although I'm slowly getting the hang of them, and learning to avoid silly mistakes like continuing to purchase shares when the goal is money. So keep this in mind when reading what follows.

As a beer lover, I found Goldbräu's subject to be rather charming, although I wish the names of the breweries and taverns had been chosen a little more creatively. The game itself is fairly simple as I understand it: the players purchase stock in taverns and breweries, and then strive to gain as much money as possible from them. Taverns increase their 'worth' if they have a larger terrace, and have a pretty waitress; they can also lose money if there's a drunkard causing problems. A tavern signs a contract with a brewery, causing half the income of the tavern to go to the brewery. But such contracts can only be inked if a player has a 'boss' in both tavern and brewery, and you can only become boss if you have the absolute majority in shares. There's three payout days, and at the end of the game the player with the most money wins. It's really nothing complicated and as such could present players with a nice introduction to the vast body of stock games.

However, where the game falls flat quite forcibly in my opinion is in the scarcity of stock—there's but 6 shares for every tavern and brewery—and the luck of the draw in drawing shares. With only 6 shares and the nasty rule that once the 6th is made public everyone owning but a single share is deprived of it without compensation (!), it is too easy to simply get locked out of profitable businesses. And the fickleness of the waitress and drunkard means that a good tavern with solid share management can be brought to its knees or win the game.  

It is these factors which made me decide against the game for regular play. I won't say no, but more than once a year is overasking, really. I'd rather play something without the  problems of luck of the draw, too little shares and wild income fluctuations. Chicago Express comes to mind—although that has its own, pardon the pun, share of problems. But at least it plays a lot more smoothly.

I don't think the game works with 3 players, my low rating reflects that.  I'm still looking forward to playing it with 4, this is the type of game I should like.  It just didn't work with 3.  By the middle of the second (of three) rounds, it didn't matter what choice the person in last place made, their position was hopeless.  Update.  After playing with 4, my low rating stands.  I'd much rather have spent the time just drinking beer instead of playing a game about beer.

This is a great game that combines some mechanics from other games.  It has a simultaneous hidden action selection like Hoity Toity.  It has area control like Domaine/Lowenhertz.  And it also has you owning shares in compaines like several other games.  It plays quickly once you get the hang of it.  The theme of the beer gardens/brewerys works very well with the game.  THe players jointly own beer gardens and the brewerys that supply their beer.  The game lasts three weeks, with scoring at the end of every week.  Each day each player selects from one of three actions: expanding a beer garden (which will make it score more), placing a boss/placing a brewery contract (bosses give you leftover income and allow you to expand the garden or swap brewery contracts), or buy a share in a garden/brewery.  The income made by each beer garden is split between it and the brewery that supplies it.  The income of each garden and brewery is split between the players who own shares, proportional to their amount of shares, with remainders going to the player who controls the boss.  Plenty of interaction, and with simultaneous action selection, there is little down time.

Strange mix between simultaneous action selection and stock holding mechanics. Unforgiving and opaque, it requires too much dedication for the unpredictability of the outcome of some action.

I just stink at stock games and this is no exception. But despite that, there's a lot of clunkiness going on here, especially with the money distribution on payday. And some of the interface trainwrecks include the muted colors of the brewery contracts and the way the turn marker is passed.

This game borders on broken.  It's all about the shares.  If you get them you can win, if you don't, you will lose.  The theme is low-to-medium.  In the end, there just isn't enough decisions to make to warrant spending time playing it.  The theme of beer-houses is just cool enough to cover up its inadequacies...on the first couple of plays.  Unfortunately now I get a hangover at the mere sight of this game.

RATING: 5
Players are investors who can take shares in beer-gardens, or breweries.  Beer-gardens grow in size (like Domaine Kingdoms), with larger gardens earning more money.  Half the profits go to the respective share-holders in the Beer-garden and the supplying brewery.  Simple, simultaneous action game where players can become boss of a garden/brewery (allows change of suppliers, and gets left over profits); grow their beer-gardens; or purchase stock.  The game is okay but there are some concerns - the stock purchase mechanic is random making the game feel like a "ride"; scoring is likely to cause a migraine; and the rule of six is just cruel for solitaire share holders - making it very hard to dilute the earnings of a leader.

Enjoyed playing my first game of Goldbrau. Playing a board game which has breweries, pubs and beer as a theme is quite interesting. Splinting revenue between the breweries and pubs is cool. Player which owns more shares of the breweries and pubs gets the money. most money wins.

Traded 2 times. My copy and my cousin's copy.

Played 4 times. Good mechanics, nice art, well-chosen theme, but fell flat with the winner simply drawing more luckily from the draw pile.

That wasn't fun! // I got a rule wrong with 3 players, but I still didn't find this game much fun with the right rules and 4 players. I never felt like I had much control.

A game about the business of selling beer.    Game and beer in the same sentence is a good start, what awaits you with this game is a combination of simultaneous choice of actions (a group favorite) and brewery&area control.  Difficult choices abound and although the payout mechanism requires some effort, we really enjoyed this game.  I personally feel there should not be only two face up cards to choose from; 1 per player is probably a better proposition because it would increase the availability of choices and accelerate the cycling of the share/event deck.  Sobriety required, lots of thinking to be done.

A very fun game of trying to become manager of the breweries and beer garden, during the festival to make the most money.

This is an area majority type game, where players are trying to control the most profitable beer garden and breweries, throughout a three week period. It becomes quite cutthroat, as players try to outnumber each other on the game board. The game really has some nice mechanics, that all flow well with the game and the theme. It's a real joy to play. I'd say it's a mid weight game, that not to hard to learn, but it's more of a gamer's game, than it is a light family one.

I'd highly recommend everyone to at least try the game, if the chance arises.

Nice mid-weight game with a awesome theme. For some reason it reminds me of the GDW games of the 80's, but I am not sure why. Maybe it is the intimidating rules for set-up. The gameplay is very fast and simple. The scoring is its only weakness as it takes quite a while to score because of all the math.

RATING: 6
Initially had it rated higher, but I'm worried about how quickly players can fall out of the running.  For such a light game, Goldbrau appears to be very unforgiving of early mistakes.  I guess it's not quite as light as it seems, although the strategic depth is curtailed by the hugely unpredictable impact of the cards.  I'm conflicted on this one, and it'll take another play or two to sort things out.  If I don't see a close finish in my next game, then I'm probably done with Goldbräu.  I definitely have enjoyed it so far, although it has met with mixed reactions from my fellow players.

I wanted to like this game, but it was too random in which cards you get and it's too static in the bosses, as the games doesn't swing much.

It works well and there is nothing really wrong with it, but it is one of those games that leave me an impression that any player may win, no matter what he does.

Great theme, but ultimately dull due to math and money counting.

Ug. Even the math in Auf Heller und Pfenning takes mere seconds compared to this. I may have been spoiled...

RATING: 7
Good stock market game with a fairly unique theme.  The action mechanic, where you are rewarded for choosing things others aren't choosing is pretty cool.  Feels a little like you are doing the same thing over and over for 90 minutes, but I liked it.  The math is a little obnoxious, not hard, but printing the chart off the geek is nice.  The bar maid and old drunk are far too influential, the game would be much better if they weren't.  As it is, they can swing a game if turn order comes up correctly.  The luck of drawing shares from the deck is also probably a little too influential.  That could easily be remedied by a house rule to have 4 cards turned up to choose from instead of 2 or something like that.  I really like how the different mechanisms in the game work together, and I especially like the interaction between the distributors and the beer gardens.  Overall it is a neat stock game with a unique theme and I'd play it again.

RATING: 4
One play, and I'm sure we got a rule or two wrong regarding card distribution and use. The scoring is sort of mathy but no matter, the game can be played and won with an intuitive understanding of the values of the various bars and beer makers. A pleasant enough experience, but I probably won't be searching it out again.

After a second play, I'll be avoiding this. It is too likely to degenerate into situations where there is only one choice among your possible three actions. They are not equal in value, and so it's likely everyone will pick the most valuable one most often (that is, buying more share cards). That further drives up the price of share cards, making them harder to get.

One more thing: I'm still not sure we got the rules right in either play. I did not personally read them, but they seemed vague and poorly written from the description of the guy teaching. It took a long time to learn (and relearn) for such a light game.

Very enjoyable game, but it has an exceedingly fiddly scoring phase which really hampers the flow of the game. This could be an 8 or 9 from me if the scoring was better/easier. Maybe I'll just have to store a small calculator in the box.

Based on two plays.  
First time we played, there was some confusion with the rules which bogged down the game a bunch. Second play, better understanding by all, much better play!  This game may be subject to many gamers creating houserules to interpret some of the confusing translation errors(?) or modifing for different gamers' preferences.  For instance, when we played the second time, we reduced the numer of days in a week to 6 (for three players).  The first time we played, the options available were pretty limited near the end of the game. By taking out a couple turns, it created a more "down to the wire" feel that the first game lacked.  

A very satisfying game over all!

Goldbrau is a bit chaotic, but I'm a fan of the "Simultaneous Action Selection" mechanism, which works quite well here.  The fun, accessible theme has helped me get several of my non-gamer friends to give it a try.  Scoring takes some math, but it's straight-forward.  I'm always pleased to see solid game designs that don't rely on auctions or action-points.

Unfortunately, I fear Goldbrau ultimately falls into a trap Delonge himself described to Tom Vasel in an interview I read recently at GameFest.com: "...in the worst case, these games might fall through between the two chairs - too complicated for [casual gamers], too simple or luck-driven for [hard core gamers].

RATING: 6
Goldbräu takes the core concept of Acquire (invest in a portfolio of companies), adds a few light rules, and rethemes it around Beer Gardens and Breweries. In other words, I had to ignore its relatively low ranking and give it a try. It's not bad. Far from it, actually. It has 21 very quick turns a la Yspahan in which players simultaneously select one of three actions and receive bonuses for being the only player to choose an action. So there's an incentive to read opponents' probable actions, but you're not pulled up short if you're wrong (I'm looking at you, Race for the Galaxy.) There's a bit of luck in the turn order, since depending on how the cards flip you may be unable to stop opponents from buying a controlling share out from under you, but this accorded well with the game's weight and playtime. Goldbrau isn't destined to become a perennial favorite around here, but I'd gladly play again.

Update: 2nd play. Think this game needs three players. With four the simultaneous action selection becomes less interesting. Even so there just isn't much here to warrant repeat play.

The simultaneous action selection is really fun, and adds a lot of laughter in the group.
Some may find this game too luck based, but I don't think that's a problem. The game may not be so strategic, but it's really challenging to have the right tactics and timing to exploit the opportunities that emerge during the game.
The game also has a lot of ineraction between the players, that is good fun.
I always look forward to the yearly Oktober fest playing Goldbräu.

I understand why people compare this to Lowenherz (because of the action selection and territory expansion), but watch me go out on a limb and compare this to... 1830.  German style.  Goldbrau:1830 as Puerto Rico:Civilization.  Though not as good.

I see the comparison with 1830 because, as in that game, you're investing in shares that payoff proportionally.  You're trying to gain control not because it gives you a big profit margin but because it enables you to make the decisions for that business.

In Goldbrau all elements are greatly simplified, of course.  Expanding your company is just moving into an adjacent square.  Shares are acquired by drafting.

Not spectacular, but worthwhile for people who like business games with an element of simulation, but still want something quick and light.

RATING: 6
We played the 'boss' action wrong which made the game much more static. Nonetheless, I don't think the correct rules will make this a more than average game. Playing 18 rounds with the same single decision each turn, which of your three action cards you will play this turn, is too repetitive. Also, the luck factor of having the right shares turning up for auction when you are starting player or close to it does feel out of place in an economic game like this one considering the consequences of gaining or losing a majority. One of Delonge's weaker efforts.
---
Played a second time with the correct rules. Better but not great. The luck factor took out a player from the start when he got dealt four shares of the same brewery and only one of his eight inital shares was a beergarden. Add to this two or three decisive situations when the right shares were turned up and it's too much luck for a higher rating. A pity since there's a neat original economy here.

Another blind action game, which means I suck at it. Area control, stock acquisition, blind action selection, takeovers, a drunken bum and a hot waitress! It all comes together to make a decent game with a fun theme. +0.5 rating for the beer theme, but that still doesn't make it a 7 in my book.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The theme makes this game stand out a little for me.  Even though I don't drink beer, the theme is new and different, making it enjoyable to play.  The simultaneous action selection isn't too overwhelming, but it does seem like "buying shares" is the most used action, especially toward the end of the game, and that it may not even be worth it to do anything else.  It also seems like the pretty waitress may be a little too powerful.

Traded away.

A Basari-style game where players secretly choose actions and benefit from being the sole player picking the action. I found the payout mechanic to be extremely unique and well-thought out. Sadly, it seems that our game ended in a race to buy shares, and the luck of the draw really affected the game.

The group of gamers really has to be selected carefully for this game otherwise serious Analysis Paralysis could set in. It's quite easy to see how Game Theory could be used to analyse this game quite heavily. The blind simultaneous role selection mechanic with only three possible options works quite well but feels a little too limited. The general principle and theme is a good one.
The rules to this game are a little fiddly and there is a ton of mental arithmetic to get through throughout the game. I must reserve final judgement on this game as the rules weren't followed exactly in my one game. Something I'm prepared to come back to but so far I have felt more frustration than fun with this game.

An interesting take on share collection mechanism. I liked the way you have to have a stake on both the b2b and b2c levels of business to do well.

I think all the elements of the game come together nicely. I happen to like simultaneous action selection, though I'm not a fan of the paper-scissors-rock mechanic. I'm not a fan of stock-holding mechanics most of the time, so this game has a couple of strikes against it to start.

Nonetheless, the game works nicely, it isn't hard to understand or play, and it has a good length. A solid game.

Played once, 4p.  I hated this game, pretty much from the beginning.  It takes everything I hate about Hoity Toity and adds an unecessarily complicated scoring mechanism.  I will to admit that some of my distaste for the game can be attributed to the fact I was in last place the enitre game, but rock/paper/scissors games, where one or more players can be left with no action on their turn, turn me off totally.

First of all, I think the theme is great. Anything that can remind me of visiting the Hoffbrau Haus is a good thing. 

Entertaining theme aside, the game doesn't do anything that Wabash Cannonball doesn't do better and in less time. The game was a bit chaotic and seemed to drag (possibly because it was a learning game). 

[u]Recommendation[/u]: play Wabash Cannonball instead

PS. A gangster theme might fit better. The breweries become crime houses. The beer gardens become speak-easys (or places that serve specific vices). Bosses become capos. Replacing a boss becomes whacking a capo. Etc. It could work really well.

I loved this game at first as I thought it was vicious, and full of conflict. That assessment has not changed over time, but the sheen has dulled over the years. 

I love the area control, and I love the majorties game inherent to the system.

I hate the random luck of "who gets to do an action twice", and the share cards.

A recent play has brought me to the conclusion that the card luck is VERY difficult to overcome in this game. Therefore the rating as plummeted to a 6, and is probably soon to be an ex-game in my collection.

After three years owning this game, and dragging it along to game nights perhaps on 20 occasions, it finally made it to the table, and was well received.  There is a good game there, that will probably take me a few more plays to become good at playing - so far I'm terrible after two plays.  Fun amount of stick it to your neighbor play, but always for your own betterment, not true "take that" attacking.  Fun theme that is integrated with the mechanics, well produced artwork and nice bits.  I'd love to play it again soon.
The math is not that hard, really.  After one payday, it's a piece of cake, and takes time only because there are 10 businesses to distribute income from.

RATING: 7.6
This is a somewhat subtle economic game. There is a good bit to juggle but you need to maintain your sights on the shares which seems to be the most important thing. Sometimes it can be a little frustrating to pull the drunk or waitress cards when what you really want is more shares but other than that this is a great money building and influence game.

This game makes me feel like I'm the owner of some of the bars at the old market in Leuven (Although this game is really about the October festen in Germany). 
I can even buy shares of some breweries that provide those bars with the fluid that makes the world go around. 
Being a beer lover born in the beercenter of the world (Leuven), I have to love this game.

Goldbrau succeeds in bringing the theme alive with some very simple game mechanisms.
I love games that have the "there is benifit in knowing what you think" - mechanism (cfr [thing=120][/thing])

I love the theme. But as far as a market-manipulation/investment game, it sucks. There is very little control over the eventual outcome; there is not enough information in the first 4-5 days of the week to give players a good feel for where things are going to be going. But, if the card you want doesn't show up in the last 2-3 days (or if it does but you're stuck at the back of the action selection queue), well, though. As for the action-selection mechanism... well, I'm sick and tired of simultaneous action selection. Very few games do it right. "Doing it right" in my mind means giving enough information to players to at least have a shot at guessing at what the other players may select. There is none of this in Goldbrau -- either you're lucky and you're the only one who picked that action, or you're unlucky. Bleh.

RATING: 7
Great theme where players are investing in beer gardens and their suppliers.  Players have a hand of action cards and each round they each play one.  The actions allow you to expand a beer garden, become or change the boss of a beer garden or supplier/brewery OR buy a share card (2 face up or mystery meat). 

The actions have a cost and if more than one person has chosen that same action then the cost increases.  If you're the only person to choose the action then you pay a cheaper price and can receive a bonus action (for example expand a beer garden by 2 spaces instead of one).

There's some very interesting interaction in the game.  There is a finite space on the board to grow the beer gardens.  If you're the boss of two beer gardens then you can decide to grow one over another (thus reducing one).  Being the boss of a brewery and beer garden allows one to change that beer garden's supplier.  The key is that after each round payments are made to shareholders of each supplier/garden.  Shareholders in a garden receive 50% of it's profits (how big the garden is determines how much profit is to be made).  That garden's supplier will receive the other 50%. 

A drunk and waitress are also on the board (in the gardens) and can be moved around to other gardens in order to increase or decrease a garden's value. 

One issue I've seen is where a player had majority ownership of 2 gardens and was able to completely wipe out one of the gardens (shrink it to a minimum) without being stopped.  Near the end of the game a majority shareholder can position himself so that other players cannot overtake ownership.  This is something that needs to be stopped early on if possible.

There's also some luck in how cards come out, etc. but for me that only adds to the excitement of the game and most of the luck should be mitigated with later card draws.

RATING: 6
Players buy shares in beer gardens and breweries, try to expand their beer gardens, and then all the shareholders in each beer garden and brewery split the profits equally.  While this game has some neat mechanics, such as that players can make money either by trying to control beer gardens or breweries, there are some flaws.  Obtaining ownership stakes in various places is very random: it depends on which two cards are drawn at the start of each round, and what the player order is.  So, if someone is lucky enough they'll get the cards they need to get a majority stake in a beer garden early, and then can focus entirely on expanding it, thus guaranteeing huge income.  And, once all six shares of a beer garden or brewery get bought, all the minority stake holders (anyone who has only one share) get removed from the establishment, meaning that runaway winners are easily possible (as then instead of dividing the income between all shareholders, the lone remaining person gets all the money).    

I found the game OK overall, and wouldn't mind trying it again, but I think the overly luck-based ownership and winner-takes-all aspect of ownership at the end makes the game frustrating.

Comprato a pochi €uro su Milan-Spiele pensavo di essermi portato a casa un fondo di magazzino invece mi sono ritrovato un gioco molto simpatico, dall'ambientazione originale, con dinamiche semplici ma con strategie per nulla banali. Anche la durata del gioco è più che accettabile (1 ora). Tra i difetti ci metto che alla terza settimana il gioco può sembrare un po' ripetitivo, ma soprattutto come difetto trovo che il gioco è pensato solo per 4 giocatori, in 3 si può giocare ma, già dal regolamente si evince che è un adattamento. Comunque bella scoperta che si merita un voto in più per il prezzo!

A keeper (paper money gone). Also storing Looney Pyramids in box

There is some luck, but it is really about doing what you can with the circumstances at hand.

Some advice to make the game work like it should-
 
*Use poker chips vs. the paper money included. Much easier to track and payout.
 
*Use something to mark the businesses once all 6 shares have appeared and are out of game. I use black wooden cubes from another game.

*Understand how the boss action works. To block, one must prove absolute majority. This is a critical mechanic of the game that apparently many screw up. You got to play it this way for it to work.

*Know the waitress & bum can only move clockwise.

*I'm a big fan of open money in this game.  Why hide trackable information?  Doing so makes it a memory game, which this is not.

Update-March 09. I've made custom wooden selection pieces for each color, and added black cubes so you can ID businesses that have had all shares used.

RATING: 7
Goldbräu is a simultaneous action selection game in which players gradually build up stock in various biergartens and breweries, and then profit from them when payday comes around.  During each turn, players select one of three actions: expand a biergarten, place a boss/change a distributor, or buy a share.  If a player is the only one who chose a given action, they get to do it twice (except for buying stock, which just becomes cheaper).  The game has a few nasty elements, especially as players are fighting for control of biergartens, but nothing that really felt out of place--it should be noted that it's very difficult to have your stock taken away, so that at least feels fairly safe.  The SAS adds a large chaos element, as the rewards for being the singleton are large.  That said, I thought this was a generally enjoyable game that feels fairly different from other games out there.

More fun than I for some reason expected. It is cutthroat and fast moving and packed a lot of interesting moves in a relativley short playtime. "The drunk old man" or what's his name is a reminiscent of the robber in Settler. But he is more dangerous, especially close to the end in the third and final scoring round. Some luck in the way the shares are available and potentially some king-making, but if you can deal with that this is great stuff.

I think it's a more complex game than the weight rating on BGG indicates.

Ingenious game of [b]economics[/b]. Very abstract but the theme makes it easy to play with certain "house rules". Having the fridge filled with four types of beer for the four breweries and playing with the rule that the players can only drink the beers of the breweries where they have a boss has given our gaming group lots of fun moments and given the game more competition, since the players not having bosses in breweries tend to have [i]dry mouths[/i].

Incoming on a trade.. I think the subject matter will be a hit with my immediate circle of friends.

Update:  Read the rules.. I was excited as I was reading through, thinking: "Wow, this game would be GREAT for drinking while playing".. and then I got to the rules about scoring, and immediately rethought the idea.  Add this, divide that, then administer according to shares.  Yikes, where's ma calculator!?  Good thing I usually game with mathies.

Update: Yup, it happened.  The night in question there was a lot of beer going round and we wanted to give this game a shot.  Unfortunately, the maths required fizzled our brains before we even completed setting up the board.   Definately needs to be learned/initiated while NOT drunk, as opposed to what you may WANT to do, given the theme of the game.

Update:  Ok, finally played.  Going to rate it, but it'll be nothing stellar.  Goldbrau is some fun, remeniscent of Lowenherz in mechanic, but thematically and strategically very different.There appears to be a chance for a runaway leader, and I don't much like this.  Love the theme, the math truly bites.

This might be better with some slight tactical tweaking (how about a bid instead of the dominance of turn order?) but even without it Goldbrau is clearly in my TOP-5 economic games.

Probably better with 4 rather than 3 players. Bad rulebook clearly affects game rating for some people.

RATING: 4
Once the rule re: drunk/maid movement has been cleared up, the game is mechanically sound with some knowledgeable deduction. Little elements of fun, but the concept of changing bosses and when to play shares caused confusion for some. So already interest waned, but to top off the dull experience was the highly painful maths involved in working out how much income players got(even with the aid of the table in the rules), as well as the fiddling around for change. I play games for entertainment reasons, not to endure accounting exercises. I understand some attitudes will differ.

Fast paced, nice looking game with interesting theme.  Definitely has a guess which of three actions your opponents will do aspect, but it isn't a complete guess usually.  Also has that delicious decision of "Do I need that extra share more than the expansion or maybe I need to switch bosses?"

Action selection/area control game, which seems to give a feeling that it's balanced overall but every now and then something happens which shakes your faith. Oh the turn order is important, oh the card draw this turn was lucky, oh this and oh that. Eventually leaving me a wee bit dissatisfied. I will play it again to see if it was my suboptimal moves which landed me in a soup, or something else.

Chicago Express with beer? Economic game where players are investors in breweries at Seehausen am See.

O livro de regras em inglês é uma anedota, para além disso, creio que nem mesmo o autor saiba muito bem as regras, pois há uma enorme margem para cada um inventar à sua maneira, assim como uma data de coisas que não fazem assim grande sentido; enfim, apenas o pressuposto, por baixo do jogo, é que é magnífico. Com "house rules" pode ficar um jogo interessante, porque alguns mecanismos são espetaculares!

Options depend on initial card setup or on random card draws, otherwise: no options! quite boring and a bit too much luck involved here. Luck can bring someone very far on top in the beginning and the other players have no way to stop this player. Great production and great theme, game could have been improved.

Well themed and engaging for just over an hour. It feels like it plays fast and there's good choices to be made each turn. It helps if you can count and divide quickly come scoring. I've got a few ideas I'd like to try out for future games - that's always a good sign of a good game for me.

RATING: 6
A strange Benno-Delonge machine: take the Basari action cards, toss in a share based economic system and Domaine-remniscent fence expansion and you get this game about building beer gardens and running breweries.

Unfortunately, it feels as though the systems were forced fit together. There's far too much maths, the swing of the waitress and bum could kill a player and the restrictions on actions just offer frustration instead of an elegant way of limiting players. Players are unable to do anything more than react tactically to cards that are turned over and where opponents are trying to put their bosses.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Stock, Area, Simultaneous Action Selection. Not bad, not the best FBD game. The choice of action each round is actually fairly agonizing, except it feels like your options really dwindle the last few rounds of the game -- everything is too tight at that point. I need another game or two to see if that is the norm or not.

I toted this bad boy around for a while.  I even set the damn thing up a few times only to have it put away again.  I figured that I would like it and I was right.  I really enjoy the game.  There is a wonderful balance between the tactical mapping, the area control and the stock market to keep me engaged right to the end.  The game plays quick, but I never felt that the moves were overly obvious.

Many fun choices.

This is most definately going to hit the table again.

Nice little economic game, actually, that I think is a bit underrated because it's available so cheaply.  I like the simultaneous action selection and the components are great, but I can't help wondering if the decision tree might be a bit too limited in that acquiring ownership by buying cards is your best bet for most of the game.

UPDATE #2: The limited decision tree and really having to get cards outweighs the psychology of trying to time getting them on the cheap.  A so-so economic game that isn't bad to play from time to time.

A pretty good game, but with some potential problems:
  1) a fairly big luck component (card draw, initial setup). I think this is probably somewhat manageable, but will have to play more.
  2) a lot of math in calculating payoffs - simple, but tedious
  3) probably need to play with people who all understand the game, or it may be difficult to see/stop the leader
  4) the Hoity Toity Piratenbucht guess-what-everyone-is-doing-and-don't-do-that psychological guesswork game ... I just don't like that type of game very much.

I'm a sucker for economic games and enjoyed it, although I had trouble wrapping my head around this one.  The rules with the boss and its powers confused me for most of the game (I think I got it now).  Also, I like the mechanic of half the earnings of the beer garden going to the brewery, but I kept forgetting that during the game also.  As a result, my rating could go up upon further playings, although I have a feeling it will maybe increase one point maximum, if at all.  Update:  played again and it still seemed non-intuitive, although I haven't played in a while.

Quite underrated!

Pah!  I cannot believe my "geekbuddies" are whining about mathiness in this game!  Geez, is dividing by two really that hard, c'mon! 

Anyway, this is a really strong game with a brilliant connection between gameplay and theme!  ou have to divide your attention between the breweries, the management of the bars, and the size of the beer gardens themselves.

It's medium weight, and the complexity of the interacting elements make it a game for experienced gamers.  It plays relatively quickly, although with 4 we generally run a little longer than the stated 60 minutes (more typically around 90).

The cards, by the way, are not some magical element to fix your poor gameplay--they are meant to add an dash of unknown and balance, they act like "inside information" in a  hostile takeover.  Too many people commenting here are apparently under the impression that the cards should be a major element (they should not!).

Although there is luck in the game in terms of what cards come up when for purchase, the brilliance is that even though the luck seems large at first play, the game actually has very little luck to it due to the action selection process.  You have almost complete control over your progression and can completely ignore the luck element by focusing on other actions.

Do not forget, if you're not 1st for the "day" you should also be playing to slow down a leader by choosing the action they want most to increase the cost to them.  Since the games are usually decided by less than $5 in our experience, increasing the cost to acquire a card you know they want can win the game for you.

:thumbsup: LIKE
- Contains 3 actions that plays on 3 mechanics: board layout, stock market and market placement/manipulation.
- Simultaneous action selection is always a good mechanic for me and the added bonus of doubling the action when you're the only one doing it brings lots of fun double guessing.
- Theme is fun and unique. Drunken bum and pretty waitress add to theme and gameplay. Oh and the game comes with coasters; how cool is that!
- It plays fast and the economic engine and scoring is not overly complicated and opened. So unless you have perfect memory, end game is tight and the winner is a surprise until the end.

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- Counting the money at the end of every week is terribly long and convoluted. It is necessary and it can't be done differently, but it really kills the flow of the game.
- English translation of the rule contain errors and could use some work. I think I played 5 games before getting the waitress/bum movement correctly (they must move clockwise).

:star: VERDICT
This game feels like a breath of fresh air.  Different little mechanics in a package I've never played before.
I've really enjoyed it and would get it out more often if it weren't for the money counting. Still deserves a repeated play every once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Initially hindered by a fairly creative translation effort on behalf of the English rulebook writer(s), I eventually figured out the game and got in a play with 3 other aspiring brewery/beer garden owners.  Goldbrau has a nose of dandelions and beer-brewing fun.  However, it's a little bland on the tongue and leaves a slightly hoppy/bitter after-taste.  By the end of the last payday, the game was feeling somewhat repetitive, fairly chaotic, very mathy, and despite some good ideas, not as fun as the combination of beer and board games ought to be.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5.5/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
A not intolerable stock market game where stocks are held in pubs (grow by adding more tables and an attractive bar wench) and breweries (supply to the pubs). 

The dividend calculation is unnecessarily bizarre, though though it does highlight the most interesting part of the design: the fee to the manager of the bar/brewery is the remainder after dividends are paid, so manipulating income and control can pay well. But the luck of the cards is high and control low, so win or lose it's not a satisfying experience. I might still rate it a little higher -- the simultaneous action selection is cute and I do enjoy the theme -- if not for the quality of the competition among stock-holding games. But when Chicago Express exists and plays in a similar timeframe, I would absolutely resist wasting the time on this instead.

A nice business game based on building a better beer garden. There are six beer gardens and four breweries. The beer gardens try to build the biggest gardens while the breweries supply the beer gardens. Players have interests in these businesses and manipulate them via cardplay very similar to Basari/Lowenherz. There are three paydays in the game, which would seem to be an accountant's wet dream, but left us woozy. Money and numbers flying every which way. The game does provide a very helpful table for payouts. Still, this will be played with poker chips in the future.

This is based on a single 3 player game. I want to play this game more. I think it would make a better 4 player game. There's a lot of luck involved but not so much that you have no effect on the outcome. very rich in theme. I played this again last night. Despite the fact that the opening is somewhat random and there is a chance for some hard luck, you can still win with a bad opening position. I was stuck with one beer garden the whole game, and I still won by three Thalers.

I enjoyed this despite all the flaws: too much luck in the setup, seemingly impossible to get the shares you need, and some rock paper scissors thrown in for even more luck.  And then there is the brain-crunching scoring.  And yet, there were so many moments where we all groaned when the action cards were revealed, and the game moves along very briskly with hardly any downtime.  I'd like to try this with the setup variant.

I was much more excited to try the game than I had fun playing it. I had a feeling that might be the case since I don't seem to like the games with these kind of action selections. That actually didn't bother me. The shares coming up in the way they did kinda bugged me. Why can't I just buy in to the places I want? I'm not happy with that mechanism.

The English rules have an error and are vague for the 3-player game.

I don't understand the high ratings this game gets.  Every time we've played, the ending has been anemic.  21 turns, and the last 4-5 everyone just chooses "draw share" because there's nothing else to do.Traded.

Good themed game, with plenty of in-game strategies in the role-choosing.  The money is not tight, so there's not too much financial management, and the game grinds to halt for 10 minutes to calculate the pay days.  But knowing how and when to maximize your opportunites is key in this game.

There's nothing really remarkable about this game apart from the cool theme. A nice little mechanic, the payment system lends nice smoothness to the area control mechanic and the game mostly seems to fit together well. More plays could well show up unbeatable strategies, which would drop this.

I was disappointed with this Franz-Benno Delonge game.  I was expecting big things, especially after enjoying Big City, Fjords, and TransAmerica (with Vexation) so much.  But Goldbrau just didn't do it for me.  I want to give it another try sometime, but I have removed it from my list of games to buy for the time being because the first play left me cold.  The decisions really weren't all that interesting, and it suffered from being dominated by that mechanic that bothered me so much in games like Basari, which is where everyone secretly and simultaneously picks 1 out of 3 actions, and then reveals, and you benefit greatly if you picked something that no one else picked.  It results in the classic Princess Bride conundrum of trying to figure out which thing your opponents are going to pick and out-think them.  This sounds good in theory, but it's just devolves to chaotic game play in practice.

Simple game (you need to be good in division by the way), that results in a very interesting game. It plays fast. Recommended for players that like economic games.

A neat area control/stock market game, where doing something different from everyone else pays off.  Perhaps a little too dependent on luck... in particular drawing the right start cards, or getting to move the waitress at the right time are big advantages.  Overall I enjoyed it though.

Art and style is great, but the game itself is rather lackluster. It's thankfully short, but the winner seems to be the person who got lucky to draw the right stock mix. Drawing stock will sometimes get you what you want, and sometimes will get you something mostly useless, like the drunken bum. The share mechanism, the central mechanic of the game, doesn't have much tension to it. Most of the time, you know whether you're going to get the share or not, because of turn order.  The whole game reeks of something that needed to go back for some serious redevelopment. Seems like too much was taken away to leave a decent game.

Goldbrau is a very, very cool game about gaining territory, trying to be the only person to choose a particular action, and gaining majority and control in companies.  Unlike some other games where you own shares in businesses, your shares in a business do not necessarily guarantee you control in Goldbrau.

RATING: 6
Rated after 2 games, the latest one was with 3 players. I have high hopes, that the game is better with 4 players and that I can rise the rating at least to seven.

Once you learn the rules, the game itself is quite fast. However the rulebook is quite bad (at least the English version we had).

Card Game; Seehausen am See. For many years, more and more people visit this idyllic village during the annual summer fest. In these three weeks, the breweries and beer gardens in the village make more money than during the rest of the year. So, you and your opponents become hardened businessmen, who rush to Seehausen am See to invest in the businesses there with an eye toward the large profits that come during the festival.

This is another stock game, with some mechanics thrown in there to make it different from what else is out there.  The scoring is unnecessarily complicated, but may seem less so with familiarity and a different way to keep up with money and who gets it.  There are better stock games out there, though.

An area/stock-control game based on bars and breweries. At first play, it is unclear what the strategy is. Also, there is a lot of luck -- benefit from action selection, starting positions, share card draws, etc. The major annoyance are the payouts -- which require tons of calculating and dividing.

One playing so far - A little undecided on this one, certainly not awful, but not necessarily a thing of beauty either.  Seems to be a lot of emphasis on the acquire share action with a bonus for chosing a different role from other players.  Definitely need another playing to decide on this one.

RATING: 6
This game seems to be a mix of pieces and parts that ends up resulting in relatively predictable moves based somewhat (if not heavily) on your (random) initial position.  The simultaneous action selection mechanism is cribbed from (but better done in) Edel, Stein & Reich, and the beer garden sizing is cribbed from (but again, better done in) Lowenhertz/Domaine.  I might just be missing something, but this one just didn't do anything for me.

Provisional rating after one play.  I don't know how the three player game plays out, but this really felt like a "four players only" game.  Timing the "take-over" of businesses (either the beer gardens or the breweries,) seems to be the most important thing.

I played this at a games day and was completely confused by it.  By the end of the game, I still didn't understand what I was doing.  I'd like to read the rules, and try it again sometime before I can rate this.  It looked like there was an interesting game here.  I assume that that's the case.

UPDATE:  OK, I've now played it a 2nd time and liked it a lot better.  This time I believe that I actually understood the rules (I'm not sure why I have such a mental roadblock set up with this game), and a few times I even tried using strategy, to good effect.  I think a 3rd time playing will cement this game for me.

UPDATE #2:  After a few playings, I really like this game.  I still can't decide if this has a steep learning curve for everyone, or if there's something about it that takes a long time to click for me personally.  At any rate, I really enjoy this game, and think it has some very good quirks.

Now I know why I got this in trade. Although I'm sure there's a decent game in there (somewhere), it is destroyed by fiddly rules, unintuitive play and a board absolutely crammed with bits. Although all who played it have played much more complex game, none of us could really get our head around any sort of strategy or even how to score points. Bleh.

Combining the mechanics of share holding, area majority and simultaneous action selection.  Goldbrau does not seem to do any of them particularly well.  Looking over the type of actions one can perform, expansion usually is best left to other people to choose unless you are the sole proprietor of the beer garden.  Challenging for the boss position is only useful nearing scoring or if you are trying to set yourself up to replace the contract with your own brewery (better if you can accomplish both on the same turn).  Then there's the card acquisition, which is almost too dependent on luck and if you never get the shares you need when you are the starting player, there is very little chance you will do well in the game.

Although the area majority aspect is slightly more interesting, but as indicated before it is limited to the luck of the draw, so no matter how good you are, if you don't have the right cards, there is very little you can do.  Not a bad game per se, but why would you spend time on one with a patchwork of poorly implemented mechanics when you could just play El Grande or Acquire?

There's a lot of fun to be had in deciding when to buy shares, and when to try for a hostile takeover. Expanding your beer garden and raking in the cash does have it's upside but on the downside I did have to do a lot of division, and it was my understanding that there would be no math.

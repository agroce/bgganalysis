This may be THE Market-Garden game out there.  It's complex without being overly complex.  It's detailed without being too detailed, and it is extremely fun and challenging.  The only negatives are that it takes awhile to play (but it does solo nicely) and the tiny print on the counters.  If the latter is an issue for you, go get [url=http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/?14@@.ee6ce3c/540]the Chris Fawcett alternate counters[/url].

Wow! Never tire of this game.  Always prefer playing the Allies because that's where the challenge is - to do as well or better than historical reality.  Dare I say it's too easy for the Germans?  Love the step loss and travel/combat mode features. Must say that the tiny printing on the counters is a nightmare.

The allies have a hard time in this game.  The German player knows exactly what the operation is targeting from the off.  The third bridge can be difficult to reach let alone fight for and hold.

Even a double blind system would suffer (this game is not double blind).  The Germans know what the allies are targeting even in the first hours of Operation Market Garden and the single road that they were advancing along means that the game of blind mans bluff is very limited.

I think this kind of operation (Battle of the Bulge as well) is difficult to simulate since the defence is not under any doubts what the attacker's objectives are (20-20 hindsight).

Having got that off my chest, this is a good game and one of these days one of my friends will get the right combination of luck and skill to win this game as the allied commander.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

A fascinating game. Good rules booklet, great map, shame about the tiny print on the counters. A very difficult game for the Allies, especially around Arnhem (as you'd expect). XXX Corps always take longer to cover ground in my games than historically though. Playing the full campaign really does feel like 4 mini battles in 1 though as the para divisions struggle to hold on. If you have an interest in Market Garden, you must get this.

Not my favourite combat system or map, but an interesting simulation nontheless. If the Paras don't get to the bridge on turn 2, they won't get there at all. However, the Allied player can still win, if the German player is too agressive or careless and loses too many troops. Long game.

Highly playable by virtue of manageable rules, maps that don't take up much space, and a game that can be finished in two sittings.  Counters, however, leave a bit to be desired, marred by Small Print and slightly-oversized for the hexes (cutting corners on counters will bypass that smoothly).  More than 30 years later, this is arguably the best Market-Garden game you can buy (if you can find a copy).

Another campaign that has always intrigued me. I am intrigued by desperate, long-odds scenarios like Market Garden. The valor, fidelity, and sacrifice by those in situations like the Red Devils at the Arnhem bridge are a source of awe and amazement. How did they do it? Why did they do it? What is it about human nature that allows them to hang on -- for one moment longer -- under trying circumstances? Having spent 30 years in the Navy, I think I know, although I never underwent anything like these folks did. 

In 2012 I picked up a set of updated counters from kerryanderson@shaw.ca. Much easier on the eyes, and a great addition to improve this classic game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As complex as it can be, it is more playable than the old SPI monster classic "Highway to the Reich".  John Butterfield's design is far more solitaire friendly than any other "Highway" airborne/ airdrop game.  The game map is very coloful and functional.  This is a rather intensive study on the campaign.  Immense joy is derived from the tinkering of the rules in mind.  An excellent game choice for 2 hard core players. 

The game might be a bit long to someone nowadays but the study pays.  The shortest scenario lasts 8 turns, simulating the first three days of the XXX Corps Breakout in an attempt to relieve 82nd and British 1st Airborne Divisions.  The other two scenarios, The Beiseged and Operation Market-Garden Campaign scenario both lasts 26 turns. There are three Campaign scenarios. One historical deployment scenario, one hidden Airborne Reinforcement (i.e. variable drop zones for the Airborne arriving after turn 3) and one Free Deployment.  Altogether, there are five scenarios to choose from, exploring almost all the historical options to the Allied Commander.    

A very special feature of this game is the way to handle movement and combat actions.  It is more complicated than some other WW2 wargames I have seen.  There are quite a number of different types of units and each can enter into “Travel” mode.  While all the units have movement allowance of six, the terrain cost differently when they are in different modes.  Needless to say the unit moves faster if it is in travel mode along a road.  The terrain is very mixed in the combat areas depicted by the beautiful horizontal maps, with forest, rough and mixed terrain types dominating.  One very unique rule here is  the “exploitation column” – units are organized into column in travel mode.  They can move after the lead unit, which is also in travel mode, through the just vacated hex by the enemy units in a retreat as a result of fire combat.   All motorized units in column therefore can move through the same hex and follow the lead unit as far as it can through the major road hexes, and there are quite a few of major roads in Holland.  Road congestion is reflected in that a unit in travel mode cannot pass through another one in travel mode, nor can it stack with another friendly unit who is also in travel mode.

There is also a distinction between light and heavy zone of control a unit can exert into its six surrounding hexes.   Unit with heavy weapons in “Combat” mode, i.e. when a unit is not in “Travel” mode, exerts heavy control except into city or across a river or canal hexside.   Enemy unit can only leave heavy zone of control by paying three additional movement points and cannot move directly into another hex in heavy control.  Enemy unit has to stop at the hex in heavy control but need not stop if it enters a hex in light control.  A unit can move out of a hex in light control by additional two movement points but can enter into anther hex in light control, however upon which the unit must stop.  

Fire combat is basically a strength-based, locating the correct column by the total no. of combat strength participating in the combat.  Dieroll modifiers mainly come from HQ support, anti-tank or engineer support.  Combat is always voluntary and you can choose not to attack an enemy unit in your unit ZoC.  A player always declares which units to attack and what are the target defending units.  But before the offensive fire is resolved, the defending player has the opportunity to declare and resolve defensive fire first.  This is particularly an advantage to the German many anti-tank units spreading across the towns and rivers lightly defended.  They are fully capable to disrupt the attacking units and thus stop their attacks.  At strength of 1 or 2, a defending anti-tank unit behind a river rolling a 5 or 6 with a dice can disrupt the attacking units as it benefits from terrain fire modifiers.  Other fire table results are 1 or 2, meaning the no. of step losses inflicted onto the enemy units.   For the result of 1, a defending unit is disrupted and can satisfy a step loss by retreat one hex.  An attacker unit receiving defensive fire result of 1 cannot convert such a step loss by retreat.  For the result of 2, the target unit (attacker or defender) must become disrupted, loose two step or retreat one hex and lose one step.      

Sounds intriguing? Yes, one must master the tactics of movement before playing good the game.  You have to know where to stop and when to attack.  A commander has to know how to deploy his units best and in what posture – attack or travel.  He should plan well ahead even long before engaging the enemy.  A good formation should keep every other intact and closely, and should be within the HQ to benefit from its support.  If you do everything right, the final result would be a blast to the enemy.     

I played a trial game of The Besieged scenario for a few turns.  The 1st, 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions began the game to drop into the landing zones, a specific hex number on each unit counter of these divisions and its six surrounding hexes.  During the Air Phase of Game-Turn 1, the Allied player performs the Airlanding Procedure, in that half the time the airborne unit would become disrupted, sometimes with a step loss too according to the Airlanding Table.  The terrain in which the unit is dropped into modifies the dieroll result.     

There are many more features in the game apart from the above: Supply and Isolation, Prepared and Entrenched Positions, German Reserves, Bridge Demolition and Repair etc.  They are not that hard to absorb and they add significant historical flavors to the campaign.  All the efforts are justified with a game that is well researched. The rules make sense.  They are all there for a good reason. The game develops the historical way and you could imagine you are sitting right there next to General Eisenhower as his aid-de-camp, overlooking the combat map while the units are battling out.  It can be said of what is an authentic operational study of the campaign when you are playing the game – or the simulation itself.  Time is very well spent and I enjoy every moment of the game.  I feel I gained a lot of insight into the Market-Garden Operations.  I am proud of the designer making it such a game accessible with the right amount of chromes.  It is definitely a game that worth to be played again and again, especially for those who are interested in this Allied campaign, fighting it out hard and tenaciously.

Hey, the counters are a bit of work to read but the game is a blast to play.  The German reserve system provides a wealth of options for the German while keeping the Allied player on his toes throughout the corridor.

This is the game that got me interested in the battlion level of simulation.  The number of situations in this game make it especially interesting.  The set piece assault by XXX Corps, the rush for the bridge and desperate defense by 1 Parachute, the fight for Nijmegen bridge by the undermanned 82nd and the need for the 101st to hold the corridor after the XX Corps passes.  Both sides get to attack and defend throughout the game.

The rule book is perhaps the best designed of any game of this complexity and this IS complex.  The rules are clear, illustrated and annotated.

Played this a ton back when it was first out, but haven't played it since the '80s. Probably as good a playable game on Market Garden as there is. One of the strengths of the design as I recall is in showing the terrain problems both sides faced. The British have their large Corps, but can't do much away from the 'island road', as was the case historically. Has an epic feel without the epic size of stuff like Highway to the Reich or the more recent MMP monsters.

I probably haven't played this game in almost twenty years. It takes a long time to play and the font on the counters are so small, I now need a magnifying glass to read them. So why do I rate this game so highly?

If you are a budding game designer, I implore you to get this game and read the rulebook. Observe the logical flow and readability of the rulebook and how the rules make perfect sense the first time you read them. Simply put, this is the best rulebook I have ever had the pleasure of reading and should be used as a template for all future game designs.

A really fun game... that monumental traffic jam as XXX Corp tries to drive down that highway! Market-Garden is a difficult subject for a wargame: the players have complete knowledge of what is going on whereas the actual participants were constantly encountering the unexpected. Hell's Highway handles this problem better than most.

RATING: N/A
One of the great grand tactical games, focused on Operation Market-Garden (A Bridge Too Far). While some complain about the complexity and time needed, this game is far better than the short Arnhem, yet far more playable than Highway to the Reich. Great multi-play for 3, 4, or 5. It does take approx 28 hours to play the entire campaign, but clearly shows that failing to hold Arnhem (historical) does not always lose the game!  Map hexes are very slightly smaller than counters though, so encourgage you to trim counters or enlarge map. Also, printing is very small and as a "seasoned" gamer, found that adding some color stripes along the edges helps with unit differentiation. Enjoy

Great game, very playable. one of the best of the Victory Games first generation. The map certainly looks like a last version developed by RAS. Sadly, the same is NOT true of the counters, which have TINY unit markings! But it is a playable, exciting version of HTTR. Lots of great things here - though I don't like the rules formating. Just set it up and get started, and it will make sense. Unlike SPI rules, you just can't seem to simply 'read' the first releases of Victory Games rules (Ambush, NATO, etc) and grasp them. You have to put them on the board and try to see what they are telling you. (The Civil War being the exception. They worked well in explanation.)

looking for an oppoent or team of players - Great game, lots of very close decision making to be made. love to play with multi-commanders, the game lends itself very well to multi play.  Covers all aspects of the battles, and links very well the strategic and tactical decisions and clearly shows how much S*** you can be in if the wrong strategic decisions are made.  has an excellent system of strategic movement for the germans and also offers alternative landing zones, times for amore honest game with the germans having to guess more.  I've played 3 times in the historical setting and it was still very close but I never made it to Arnhem with enough troops who were then able to get across the Rhine

I have played this several times over several decades. the Germans must keep zoc  on the roads to keep the allies from rolling all the way down the road to nijmagen.

The best Market-Garden game and a rule book that makes a complex system manageable. Uses the left side of each page for the rules and the right side for diagrams and examples of play.

This is the house rule on this game with which I played last year;Make a units of 9SS(6817)*2(each have 2 firepower 1 step)and replace original unit with these units(I uploaded the image).If the both players are well experienced to this game,these new units brings you much tence and interesting situation.We also have a good time in last game with these.
(Talking about the game balance,I feel that the dice roll of England 1st para troops heavyly influence on the outcome of the game.)

Indeed a brilliant design from John Butterfield. Plays great. Still relevant.  Never understood the small typeface for counters. Of course I never noticed it till recently. Hmm. Could be because I'm thirty years older?  Really love the maps. There was something simple, eye-pleasing and elegant about VG maps of this period in gaming.  And the unique entry staging areas actually gives the map an even greater attractiveness.  A winner from every perspective. 

Note: There are replacement third party counters now available out there.  Was treated to a copy of them by a friend.  Nicely done. Big numbers and even vehicle silhouettes.

Beautiful components. The game has some innovative features. The combat system is good but with more dice-rolling than necessary.

Victory Game's recreation of Operation Market-Garden.  A new combat system that suited this battle particularly well.

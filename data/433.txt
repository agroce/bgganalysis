The new revision is an excellent stock trading game - in some ways better than the excellent Acquire.  One niggly issue is that the rules have neglected to tell you that a hotel chain can have max. 7 hotels in it (or rather, it can have more but the value does not increase after 7) so a given chain has to be in 3 separate locations to end the game!

Enjoyable "take that" stock-trading game: I think I prefer it to Acquire, more choice in what to do and who to mess with, and slightly easier (I think) to see what's going on. Would like to play more.

yet another in a growing series of games where i feel like i need to read the rules myself because it feels so wrong.  this one left my scratching my head about whether or not it was played right, and glances at the rulebook seemed to show that it was clearly written but poorly organized.  onto the game it has a lot of stuff i should love: stock competition, dice activation, etc.  fell flat in play though, the game was actually aborted due to a combination of shutouts and non-interest.

A game that reminds me of Acquire, yet different in play. Fast buy and sell, a really nice economic game, simple system, but with enough deepness and you have to be constant alert.
Lowered my score from 9 to 7 because shark was back in those days a good game, but now, almost 10 years later I would always prefer Acquire.

RATING: 5
Bought this after finding it on an under-rated games list.

Unfortunately, I didn't find it at all under-rated; game play is fairly unexciting and, in a couple of three-player games, one player got locked out of the game almost completley simply due to bad card draws.

First Play: Initial impressions were that this had strong flavours of Acquire, the expansion of a colour, the collection and sale of shares. However its immediately apparent that its a heavy duty gambling game. Guess at the right shares to buy, roll the dice and get the guess right and you will be rolling in cash. Get it wrong and you will languish.

The options seem readily apparent, the opportunities for skill are out weighed by the effect of luck. Not a game I'd readily play again

It's like a roller coaster ride, and everyone has some influence on the ups & downs (for better or worse).  There is a lot of guesswork in buying stocks.  The dice roll for building placement adds more luck.  I recommend playing with the "Rule of 7" variant.  There is a lot of hurt-your-neighbor action in this game; personally, I don't need more of these games in my collection.

This is an interesting little game.  Sort of like acquire, but a little less tactical and more luck based.  The major flaw is that you often have numerous money transaction on each player's turn, which can really slow things down.  This is certainly a poker-chip game.  Other than that, it's quite enjoyable.

Pretty fun, light, stock trading game.  Basically, try to invest in "safe" companies and get out before they get gobbled up.  

The financial system here is also really odd.  When a stock goes up, not only does he value per share go up, but the owners also receive a dividend.  It just seems strange that players are rewarded twofold for their holdings, which I didn't really care for.

Also, getting behind early can be really tough to come back from, as owning more stock equals making more money for the most part in this game.  So long as the leader isn't taking unnecessary risks with his investments, he should do well.

Overall, fun once in a while, but I don't care for the mechanisms much.  I'd take Acquire over this, which has a similar feel, pretty much every time.

Surprisingly entertaining game. The luck of the roll seems to be way too dominant for my tastes, particularly the bonus for placement. But this is definitely one of the more solid luck-drenched speculation games.

Buy and sell based on the current board state, roll and place a pawn, possibly receive a bonus, buy and sell based on the new state. Repeat. Several colors of shares, pawns are placed in a rectangular grid with six areas. Roll a die with the colors (and a wild) and a regular d6. Place a pawn in the indicated area. Big groups of pawns make it go up in value. If it joins a group that is smaller, the smaller group blows up, costing the owners share value and cash.

Fun stock market game in the tradition of Acquire. Quite a slice of luck but moves along pretty fast - don't be afraid to sell.

You probably don't need this and Acquire as they occupy a very similar space - Acquire is a little more thinky while this is a bit more wild and 'free-wheelin'. This is the more 'fun' so this is the one I will go with.

RATING: 8
Players are investors on the stock markets, which is abstracted by a grid. The grid is divided into five or six areas (depending on what edition you have). Company buildings are positioned on the grid, and if they form groups, their stock grows. The idea is to speculate in stock purchases to get the jump on the other players, and to anticipate when a company is in danger and sell out before the stock plummets. Recommended. (Be aware: the 7 building chain rules are missing in the new English edition).  A firm favorite of mine, from the Flying Turtle edition days.

There's some randomness but it's mitigated. Definitely playing this again soon. It would work very well online.

A lighter, more freewheeling riff on Acquire, with stock values rising and falling precipitously. Recommended with the caveat that you should look for the vastly superior 2001 Ravensburger/Rio Grande edition (be careful, there's also a 1991 Ravensburger edition).

This is quite fun, especially around the middle-end. To me, it takes too long to play for what it offers (2 hours in a 4-player game is not unusual, I think, and even longer with 5-6 players), but it is a fun diversion. There's a huge luck factor in the dice roll, and a few lucky rolls can give you top bonuses, with the ability to buy good stocks, and make it hard for your opponents to catch up.

I managed to feel like I had more control over the game than Acquire, even though it also seems more random and wacky.  I think that it uses most of the fun elements of Acquire while being simpler and faster, so it's a little more entertaining.  I'm just not an Acquire fan.

Cuttroath game, I favor this one over Acquire; both can be compared (same subject matter, position on board influences values of shares), but this one is much more satisfying..

initial rating

Even though I own the Flying Turtle version we played with the "shark zone" as I made up the newer board to try it out. 

I'm not sure what happened, it could be that we all played too defensive because there were not too many takeovers so this is certainly an initial rating, we also only played with 3 which I could see now 4 or 5 might be better. From all I read this should have possibly been more fun than Acquire especially if you like screwage which I do but so far Acquire gets my vote. 

The luck in the dice really didn't help things either so I will have to try the roll two dice variant

=> traded

RATING: 8
AUG13. OK, Maybe not a 9 after all. Is it a Power Grid? No. But for what it is, it is a very good game that is miles better than most of today's light/family games.

JAN11. OK - I admit it. The board with the Shark is kind-of OK after all. Rating for that up to 8.5. The original still just holds the edge for me because you can play the variant with the eight-sided die which changes the game for the better.

NOV10. Have played the newer board a couple more times since and now I have adapted to the single central Zone, it will increase my rating to 7.8. Still prefer the original board - less "risk", more power/clout available per player.


Stumbled across this many, many years ago in a game sale in Hamleys (London). Bought it because I was looking for a great stock trading game. I can't say it's great, but I love the malice that this game always seems to bring forth whenever we play it, but most others hate the game for it. I prefer this to Acquire, but only just. Although I have the Ravensburger edition, I still play the original Flying Turtle version.

I recently tried the newer Ravensburger edition - the one with the central Shark zone. On one play I rate that version a lowly 4.

The pink sheet version of Acquire! It lacks the player options and innovative payout methods in the Sackson classic, but holds its own as a light, economic piece of nonsense for 6 players. Market timing is key, but also hedging against the fickle die rolls limiting tile placements. Although it's tempting to accumulate and dump shares regularly, holding steady and weathering the bumps often pays off. Beer and pretzels at its finest. Invites lots of table talk. Very social and fun game. Rating based on the 2001 Ravensburger edition. I haven't played the others.

UPDATE: I've since been introduced to Speculation, which scratches very much the same itch as a light stock game, but offers a bit more control. Speculation takes a slight edge head-to-head, so Shark will need to go.

Share-trading games are not too popular anymore. In the early age of boardgaming that must have been different. Acquire went through multiple editions. Ravensburger published various versions of Broker. Shark was republished by Ravensburger as well and was present for a long time. Acquire is the only one game of this type to remain popular (neglecting 18xx games which I consider a distinctive genre). Shark at least managed to maintain a very small group of gamers still mentioning and playing it occasionally. It’s also the most successful Flying Turtle release although that doesn’t mean much. 

I can see why some gamers like it. It’s easy to learn, it has relevant decisions, it’s gambling on dice rolls, it can be mean. Not surprisingly given these last two characteristics, nowadays it seems to be more popular over the pond than here in Europe where we like our (economic) games more deterministic. What I found most remarkable about Shark is the introduction of day-trading into boardgames by the possibility to buy shares before rolling the dice (betting on chances) and sell them afterwards again (minimizing exposure). Otherwise, nothing special here to entice further play. I’d rather go with Acquire or Friese’s Black Friday for this type of game.

Shark (the Ravensburger 1st edition) is excellent.  One of the few games that has survived with us for decades - and its still regularly played.  Its good with 3 players.. but absolutely deadly with 4 players as the risks get bigger and bigger.

Dont particularly like the new version with the central section, it seems to force the gameplay too much, get the old version if you can, probably the best stock trading game for 4 players around!

Central "shark" zone of Ravensburger edition and Rule-of-7 mandatory. Shark is more action-packed and forgiving than Acquire. Which means you can have a "good time" with more types of people.

Shark is just one of those games I always love to play. There are not many share dealing games that work well - generally they are heavily luck based and although there is an element of luck in Shark I think its minimal compared to others in this genre. The skill in this game is playing with the share purchases, on your turn you can buy a maximum of 5 shares, you can buy before and/or after your die roll (the die roll will probably affect the price of some shares), however at some point the single shares run out and you are left buying in sets of 5 so it is more difficult to spread your portfolio. Your die roll is the luck element of the game, but you do have influence on how its used, strengthening a share or putting it in jeopardy of crashing. Highly reccomended - as an aside I prefer the older version to the newer one.  

This is the earlier Ravensburger version.

I really enjoy this stock speculation game, which I fondly referred to as "Acquire's Evil-twin brother".  Prefer the Rio Grande, english edition because of the stragetic, centralized fifth shark zone (whereas as the Flying Turtle edition just simply has six zones 2 by 3).  The central shark zone connects to all four zones and adds much more of a risk element (and fun) to the gameplay.  Rules are tweaked differently between the two versions, for example, in the Rio edition the player who places has merger immunity from stock losses thus this always makes holding stock riskier (until your next turn).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Buy and sell stocks based on chains of "hotels" which push value up or down.  Placement of hotels is somewhat luck dependant as its based on a die roll.  While one can play with only two, its better with 3 or more.

Ultimately, I'd prefer to play Acquire to scratch this same itch so this one moves on out of my collection.  

If you are looking to pick up this game, I'd recommend pursuing the Ravensburger edition as it is beautifully produced.

This is the best edition of this game you can get. I much prefer this to Acquire. I much prefer the stock buying/selling in this game. Acquire doesn't really reward/punish owning a particular stock, which makes no economic sense. This game makes you play the stock market.

I enjoyed the early turns of this game and even preferred the viciousness and tense placement choices of this game to Acquire but my first playing was marred by a very long endgame.  We replaced pawns lost to mergers into the supply and the game ran over 2 hours -- according to at least one rule set here we seemed to have misplayed that.  My rating reflects how I would feel about the game if we played according to the more common rule.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Vicious, vicious game -- made more vicious by the number of players playing! With 5 or 6 players, it's VERY easy for the rest of the table to conspire to sell off a color and kill it, sticking one player with the loss. Still, that's part of the game...it's tough to win if you're not on the side that's forcing the losses.

Solid stock game where company pieces are placed onto a board into groups increasing the price of that company's shares.  If a large group from a company comes into contact with a smaller group from another company the smaller group is eaten off the board and its corresponding shares go down in value.  You need to know when to sell and buy and just like real-life you also need a bit of luck in order to come out on top.  I haven't played the Rio Grande edition but it looks like it could potentially be better since it has a tighter board with an intersecting grid (4 squares with an intersecting 5th in the center vs. Flying Turtles 6 squares in a rectangular 3x2 pattern).  2005-07

Our gaming group used play Acquire exclusively until we were introduced to the second edition of Shark. Now we only play Shark. It is by far a more nasty and devious sort of game than Acquire, and one that simulates market fluctuations far better. You can really lose your shirt in one turn, or ride the trends to riches. In addition, Shark allows the buying and SELLING of shares, something that Acquire doesnt allow. In my estimation Shark is far more tense, dramatic, and engaging than Acquire.

Similar to Acquire, but using dice to determine which quadrant you build in, stock purchase can be done almost anytime during your turn.

In a competitive game, players will, in tandem, abandon companies just as they are about to lose money by being taken over. Then make bets on the resulting shells of former companies. Which may grow them to the point that they take over another shell company. And continue this process -- no one company able to attain the game-ending condition of all markers used or value 15. As a result, to play competitively, one risks prolonging the game past the point of it being fun. It is not a good design to counterpose victory condition and a good time (cf 11 nimmt).

Well the similarities drawn to Acquire are valid, especially where you can be screwed right from the start because your colours simply aren't rolled. And here money begets money so you can be left in the dust from the start with little chance to get back. At least turns are more fun and the game is faster, so it gets rated more highly by me, but it's still got more flaws than assets in my book.

Great economic game. More cutthroat than Acquire, and less mathy. Interesting "simple" rules; easy to learn, but probably still best to be taught by someone; I feel a Shark lover should make a teaching video. The game has gone through a few evolutions, but each version is still fine. I will always hope to keep a version of Shark, along with Acquire, in my collection.

Someone please create an app version of this great game!

what a strange, simple game this is.  

We had one thing wrong in that we were not removing the pieces from the game when they were outnumbered and removed from the board.  That would have significantly cut the playing time of this game and enhanced enjoyment big time.

I bought this on a whim for $10 after seeing the lower quality of the 2008 Acquire reprint (which I had been waiting for). It came with the Flying Turtle six zone map so I printed up a five zone map and have played with that. I like it more than Acquire and it scratches that investing itch quite nicely. I expect it to get a lot of plays in my current game group.

The wide-open nature of this game makes it more fun than Acquire. So many opportunities to advance your position while wrecking the plans of the other players. Great fun in making co-operative 'virtual' alliances that will be abandoned out of greed; better get him/her before they hose you!

The play always follows a pattern of single-minded growth of 1 or sometimes 2 chains as the bonuses are just too attractive to pass up when given the opportunity. I'm trying a variant where the White dr requires building on the least valuable chain (ties being a choice) and the Black dr being no build.

Nasty, nasty game filled with lots of trash talk. Unfortuately too long for such a light and repetitive game, and the luck factor is HUGE (I own the original Flying Turtle edition). However, it does feel like you're playing the stock market more so than Acquire since the market is so volatile and you can sell stocks anytime.

This is a fun stock speculation game with some good elements in it.  I enjoyed my play, and would play again.  While similar to Acquire, it has a very different feel -  I like them both, but might prefer Acquire to Shark, slightly.  I need another play or two of both to make that decision, though.

I haven't played this is seven or eight year prior to 2013 so I was wondering if it stode the test of time.  I have to say I'm still on the same level with rating.  

This is like Acquire but a bit more cutthroat.  It's almost like the inverse of the Acquire.  really like this one and still I think i prefer it to Acquire and I like Acquire.  Sometimes you find yourself discussing what the best decisions are even when it hurts you.  strangely fun despite being a bit dry.  Probably my highest recommended investment game.

At first, this game seems totally random, but what it really comes down to is the group think.  You need to play riding on the coat tails of other's decisions then busting out with a couple strong power moves.  Your turns are many times dictated by the roll of the die, but the intuition to bail on a stock and the huge swings in what people perceive as being valuable make this game highly entertaining.  A lovely gem in the rough.

While the older version works fine, but the newer version is undoubtedly the better game.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 3er, Ravensburger map.

A dice-rolling game, almost roll-and-move 'cause the rules are almost that simple, except that you're not really moving! It has the company growth feel of Acquire, but with even less look-ahead possible since your token placement is dictated by the dice roll instead of having a bunch of tiles from which to choose/plan. Seems like going first could be a slight advantage? And, of course, rolling the "right" color early in the game, to earn some money and start investing before others do -- should you start with _some_ cash?

I wouldn't mind playing again, but with more players. With 3, the business collapses were very rare, and the game seemed slow to get going.

--- Summary ---
Setup: all stocks start at value 0. Players each take 1 share of any stock.
Turn: Roll the dice (one to set color, one to set board area) and place an appropriate token at that location. Before and/or after the roll, may sell as many shares as you want and buy up to 5 total shares. When placing marker on board, company's value increases if you added to or created an orthogonally connected group of that color (variant: max value 7 per group). May only place token adjacent to different color token if doing so results in creating a larger group, which will destroy (remove from game) all tokens of the smaller group. If after your move a company's value increases, get a bonus equal to new value; also, all shares paid equal to the amount of the increase. If a company's value decreases, all _other_ players with that share must immediately pay the amount of the decrease _per share_.

Game ends when all markers of a color have been played, or all shares bought, or any company reaches value 15. Players cash out their shares; most money wins.

We are still having fun over and over with Shark, a rock-solid speculation contest in which the "game arc" can be very different from playing to playing.  (A few weeks ago we had a game end by every piece of stock being sold, something we had previously thought would never happen!)  If you're going to play the game more than once, we definitely recommend the black buildings (a variant described in the rulebook) AND the designer's rule of 7 which was part of the rulebook in 1990 but goes unmentioned in the new Rio Grande edition.

Didn't like the 'pay out if stock value goes down' rule, since it means that a strong player could quickly go backrupt in one turn with the right luck and placement (no, it didn't happen to me, just someone else in the game I was playing).  I much prefer Acquire where at least you get something for being absorbed.  This method makes me think too much of landing on a Park Avenue hotel spot in Monopoly.

Investment in stocks is a prominent mechanic in several games I love (Imperial, Reef Encounter, Stephensons Rocket, 18XX), but games like Acquire and Shark leave me cold.

RATING: 8
Fun game.  Finally managed to get the Ravensburger edition, as it's far superior to the Flying Turtle edition.  The "shark" region of the board, and the way that players place their pieces on the board, ensure that every game plays out differently.  The push-your-luck element adds a nice tension to the game.

RATING: 6.5
I like stock games, and Shark definitely shares some similarities with Acquire, except that mergers are bad for shareholders.  My biggest problem with the game is the randomness of the dice rolling, it is possible to earn very little for yourself turn after turn while continuing to enlarge your opponents' assets, or even to be eliminated on the first turn.  Although tile drawing is also dependent on luck, at least you have a choice in what to play, as well as the ability to plan ahead, something that you can't do in Shark.  So while I like the concept and the theme, I don't really care for the execution.  I would play Acquire over this any day.

RATING: 5
I dunno...I expected more from Shark and it fell a little flat with me.  Maybe we weren't cutthroat enough.  Maybe it needs another play or three.  As of right now, I won't be clamoring to get it to the table again anytime soon.

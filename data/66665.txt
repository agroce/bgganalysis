Good brazilian game, it tries too hard to be an euro game.
Have rules that don't make sense to me, seems like the rule is there just to make you overthink things, but don't fit the theme

Generally, I like engine building in games.  But in Recicle the differentiation between players was just minimal and not exciting.  One player collects blue, which are slightly cheaper to buy and sell than another who collects grey.  It takes so long to get an engine going, and the whole game is one dollar here or another there.  The game completely failed to capture my imagination in any way.

Recicle is a resource optimization game. At the beginning, players spend money they don't have to buy extensions for their recycling plant, thereby digging holes for themselves that they hope to climb out of again towards the end.

There is no reason to complain about the production values of the game but it might have benefitted from a little more development. Some of the extension prices seem a little off, and there is little to no development arc. At the end you'll still be doing much the same things as at the start of the game. It is very likely that there are still opportunities for optimization after your first play. It is, however, not clear that the game will change much if you do seize those opportunities, apart from ending up with a little more money and VPs. Also, if you don't manage to obtain certain improvements some of the available actions will rarely be worthwhile, further reducing the choices available.

Jogo muito bem feito. Com um tema brilhante. Joguei com as modificações propostas pelo autor e elas me pareceram bem mais fluídas. Movimento de área com gerenciamento e entrega de recursos muito bem executado. Preciso jogar mais vezes!

This is probably the best euro-like game Brazilian designers have managed to develop.
The mechanics of the game fits perfectly with the theme. You do exactly what a collector in brazil would do... well, not the same thing, but you get the gist of it...
The components are of B+ quality (A is always too much in any situation). 
People say you end up doing the same thing from the very begining of the game until the end. That's partly true, however you get really excited to see the engine you're building grow up in production and the whole system that it involves.
The only down side of the game is that the organic material strategy is really overpowred. If one player monopolizes it, the game gets really unfair to the other players. 
Also, people tend to undermine the power of action cards.
Bottom line: greatest euro like brazilian game so far. A great addition for you collection.

Recicle is a solid economic optimization game but it is not the hidden gem people are always looking out for. It could have needed some further development as usual for small publishers. Gameplay chugs along, the money track feels odd, some of the available purchases seem to be priced wrong and replayability is limited once the purchases and extra cards are understood and compiled into working order as there's no random factor in setup or play. Still, there's some interesting decisions to be made to squeeze out that extra efficiency that lets you gain the one or two additional VP's that will decide the game.

rating after first play. Will change for sure. I am convinced we played some rules wrong. Nobody bought warehouses, and they were not needed at all. I am also sure the card combo was not played well.

I see potential here. Will try it again after checking the problems we encountered.

Good that I came across this.

Very interesting game about recycling goods in Brazil.  Extremely tight economy, eps. early in the game.  Margins are very, very small.  Clever move mechanisms can get you in big trouble.  We didn't use most of the cards, and building construction stopped at a certain point.  Would be really crowded with four players.  A good effort.

Wow, the game is amazing! I loved the theme of sustainability ... I liked a lot too because I won all the matches I played! \o/

It'll take another play or two to see if I've really got a shine for this game -- because it'll TAKE more than one play for you to 'get' what's going on here.  I'm so willing to write this game off as yet another efficiency engine game, but something holds me back.

I usually hate artificial round limits, but it helps keep things tight here, both in terms of game play and game length.  Huh.

Good strategic game. Lots of opportunities and strategies. I've played it at least 30 times and still looking for my favorite strategy ! lol !

The theme is also interesting. Makes you think about recycling and how much is it important for society.

About [thing=66665][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=66665][/thing] is a strategy game that uses pick and deliver as main mechanic, and some economic concerns alongside.

In [thing=66665][/thing] players try to make the best use of their workers to gather material, either to sell to the market, or, which is best, to use on their own recycling plants in order to gain money and points.

It is a very straightforward game: the actions are very easy and simple to be done; the use of tiles is quite clear; even the cards, which is the part the adds more rules and exceptions to the game, considering that the cards is in limited supply and they are always the same during the game (players only take them to use in the same round, and give them back at the end of round), this complication is rather small.

[thing=66665][/thing] has a good amount of room to smart decisions and requires some forethought, as the movement of workers are, at least every other round, sending players in a different direction then the most optimized one. Yet, knowing how to make the best use of a place, is one of the main keys in doing well in the game.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every round players will use their three collectors to gather materials and/or cards. The collectors are numbered 1, 2 and 3, and players activate their workers in the order of the numbers, one at a time, starting from 1. The places on the board often give players two or three materials, which go, usually, to the cooperative. From there, the player can buy (and only the person can by from her own cooperative) or sell up to three materials to the market, receiving $1 for each - there is a limited space for materials in the market. Some spaces om the board can give players cards, or the option of buying materials from the cooperative, or gaining directly some materials, or collecting compound materials, which also go directly to the player store, but without a composting plant, their have little value - and can be very good with plant and some upgrades, like trucks.

After a collector is used, the person can do a secondary actions, which is buying a recycling plant, upgrades, hiring; or buying materials from the Cooperatives, if the person has a worker in a place that allows this; or sell materials to the market.

Once everyone has used all their collectors, then players buy, in reverse order from the one in the use of the collectors (the player that was activating last, will buy first), materials from the market. First players buy, in order, one material. Then, 2 materials. Then one - always in order.

Afterwards, is time to recycle. Players that have enough materials to activate a recycling plant, can do so. These will give the player money and points. The same plant can be used several times, if the person has enough materials stored to do so.

This will end the round. After six rounds the game ends. Players will gain 1 point for every $5 and gain points from some upgrades they have acquired. The person with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
The main two are: where to move the collector and what to buy.

The movement is important because not everything is easily within reach, and collectors can only travel one space at a time. Still, every place is good - just maybe not what you are looking for. The movement is also directly linked to your options, now and in the future, in several ways: the materials you gather may be sold to the market, from where, later, you will buy them to active your recycling plant; or the movement allows you to buy from your cooperative, meaning you can buy as much as you want or can pay; or can give you cards, that will boost your later actions; and so on.

What material to buy is usually given by what recycling plants you have. You can upgrade your storage space, and this can open more room for decisions in regards of what to buy, but not all that much, since players can use the same plant or atelier over and over.

This means that what to buy is a more relevant decisions when considering the plants and upgrades. This will send you in a direction and give you more options: be that you gain more money when selling, or buy cheaper, or collect more compound, or even is allowed to activate a collector twice; etc.

While the decisions, on themselves, aren't all that hard to be made (but the availability of materials, both in your cooperative and in the market; and how much money you have to buy things; can induce to some tough moments), they carry weight and have a branching importance.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Has a environmental theme (the recycling industry, from the collection of materials to the recycling plants) and use it right, withtout being cheesy or preachy;
- Good production value;
- Is all about strategy and decisions: no hidden information, no random events;
- Open paths to victory.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Best with 4 players, a number not often possible;
- Once you have set up a "engine" is mostly a matter of rinse and repeat, but this will mostly be the case when playing with less than 4 people;
- The same above can be valid for the movement of collectors;
- The arc of development is shallow - there is little change in what you do at the start and what you will be doing in the end;
- Replay value can suffer, as there is not even a random set up.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Learning that, in the recycling business, there is little money - most of the part, during the game, players are in the negative level of money (working on loans) - and the margins are pretty small, as unless the market is flooded with the types of material you want, chances are you will gain nothing monetarily, just points (which is what wins the game, I know). While the materials aren't in short order (very thematic), money is.

In the end, [thing=66665][/thing] offers a nice control and strategic feel throughout the play, as there are no hidden information nor unknown aspect coming from the game. As a kicker, the game deals with a theme seldom used: collectors, cooperatives and recycling, which is a big plus. But it also has issues: replay can be a concern; the arc of development is small; one strategy can be dominant if left unchecked, etc. Not perfect, but, still, with players that know the ins and outs, it can be a good option for someone looking for an strategy game of optimization and pick and deliver.

Some decent things going on in this pick up and deliver style game, but it is very incremental and the payoff just isn't there.

Really like the overall play of this game.  The contention for control of region, The selection of actions and management of worker type.  I dislike the end game scoring though.  Feel like this detracts from overall play based on the sheer amount of points and categories.

Good medium-heavy euro. One caveat, I personally think the game only really works with 4 players.

RATING: 7
3 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: Good engine building. I like the meeple color selection action and the interaction with the influence tokens. It works, and you do feel tension trying to compete with the other players. Lots of paths to explore.

DISLIKE: The game feels fiddly and disconnected when collecting the bonuses for certain actions. Occasionally we forgot to collect a bonus here or there, which caused a little disappointment. There is a turn order disadvantage.

OVERALL: Solid game. Not complicated, but dense with the amount of decisions and how different actions interact. I wish the game was just a tad more streamlined with the bonuses, but overall I enjoyed it.

A fast heavy euro which is driven by what they call a worker takement mechanic. Includes economy, production and area majority. What you get points for in the end game scoring is mainly chosen by yourself, which is kind of interesting.

Nippon, from the designers Paulo Soledade and Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro, is a very solid Euro. The theme is sure to be there, but it could be pasted in other scenarios. I loved the way the play flows, with no defined Rounds. Players simply do what the must with the actions taking meeples or consolidate. The design of this game is clever and elegant for a heavy euro.

Lots of iconography and not being in the mood for it put me out on the wrong foot. It turned out to be an OK game although I am not sure we played it right since even the guy teaching it had never actually PLAYED it other than walking through the rulebook by himself. With more experience and rules knowledge it might get down to a reasonable play time of 60-90 minutes.

Uno de mis juegos preferidos. Un euro muy temático, con unas reglas muy bien contextualizadas. Escala muy bien y me encanta la cadena de procesos que se genera en la partida. Tienes que empezar de cero en el mundillo empresarial de la época, construyendo fábricas, mejorandolas, contratando a gente, para luego producir y tomar la decisión de en qué vas a invertir los producido: en la firma de contratos locales o en la venta en el mercado exterior. Must have.

One of the best WYG games. The interconnection of the pieces of your engine, the decision and cost of deciding when to enter the area control game, the interaction with other player in meeple selection...it's all crunchy and incredible. The consolidate mechanic, which allows you to craft your own end game scoring, is very unique and a stellar addition. This one is a keeper, for sure.

Mild concern about turn order, as going last in a 4 player game feels far worse than the 3 VP compensation you get (depending on what players do, you'll likely get shut out of blueprint island making it hard to tech up in factories at the same rate as others). There are lots of options in this game and I don't think there are really build orders, but still, feels a bit off.

Played this 4 handed at club night and had a great time - lots of strategies to gain victory points and you need to keep los of "plates spinning" rather than single stream. You get VPs multiple times for having dominance/presence in the regions so this should always be part of your strategy

RATING: 6
Half an hour into the rules explanation of Nippon I was pining for the golden age of Knizia and Kramer; of tough decisions generated by mechanisms sparingly applied.  If Knizia is the Rothko of game design then Sentieiro and Soledade are the Jackson Pollocks, spattering the canvas with layer upon layer of paint. 

As it turns out, Nippon is more straightforward than all those rules make it appear. At heart it is an efficiency game; build factories, produce stuff, sell stuff, build more factories...In the modern style, a whole raft of things will score victory points and players really need to decide what they will concentrate on early.  One of those things is an area control (of internal markets) element that generates a lot of points.    That offers potential for interaction that seems largely to be neutered or rendered arbitrary by placement restrictions.  The action selection mechanism is the most interesting element of the game until players accrue enough income to not worry quite so much about the colours of the workers they choose (each colour is a -3 penalty when you next take income).  Nippon resolutely doesn't bring the industrialisation of Japan to life.  You could apply this entire design to any developing economy.  

Production quality and artwork are both pretty good.

This is a decent game with decent mechanics and theme that manages to be reasonably interesting to play.  Yet, nothing really stands out mechanically or thematically as something that is particularly fun to play around with.  The novel meeple color decisions came close to being fun to think about, but for me, just didn't quite get there.  

On first play, the building acquisition bonuses felt unbalanced, and curiously decisive in the game, almost as if a game can be decided on the first turn, depending upon which building you choose.

Nevertheless, I am willing to give Nippon another try to see if I missed something.  Our first game was a three player game.  Perhaps a four player game will be better, with more competition for spots on the board.

Update:  Yes, a much better game with four players, though I still have some concerns on the advantages of going first or second, and thus taking the best building or buildings.

RATING: 9
A great game, a nicely thematic euro with much depth. There are so many tactical and strategic decisions to be made in both the action selection and in the area control. Timing is the key as is efficiency. The area control aspect is simple, but well done in this game. It's also great that the game has a clear focus (area control) unlike the too many point salady euros out there. All the actions and mechanics are intertwined and also make nice thematic sense. Many call this dry, but I think the theme shines through easily (except the final scoring is a bit gamey). I also love the art. The quality of the cardboard pieces however are not that great. The cutting of the punchboards wasn't quite centered. I only wish the factories were little more balanced and the knowledge track a bit more useful. Those things keep this from being a 10.

Fun factor: 5/5

Definitely a gamer's game, which are generally too complex for my taste. This is one of the most complex I've ever played. From now on, I'll call such games "Kitchen Sink" games-- those which have everything but the kitchen sink thrown into them. Nippon is ultimately an area-control game, but to get there you have to deal with worker placement; coal, money and knowledge generation; building factories; producing goods; and various bonuses and enhancements. Way too many steps -- I'll take El Grande any day of the week.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Intense game largely due to the self-determination of strategies. That is to say, not only is the game low luck (only the player drop and meeple selection are random), you strategy is entirely made by choices without the game providing help (e.g., objectives).

At its core this is a simple action selection game - like a worker placement but without spaces getting blocked.  Instead it has a novel mechanism where you take a meeple each time you choose an action and every so often you need to consolidate and pay for the number of different colours of meeples you have collected.  I dont see this as a mechanism that will catch on but it works well enough.  The end game bonus multipliers I like a good bit more.  There are a lot of moving parts in this game and this masks what is at its heart quite a simple game.  First game feels very much like a training game, is a moderate amount of theme here but nothing really to make me want to pick this over other games but will always be happy to play it.

:d10-4:

3/16: Subsequent plays have confirmed my hopes that there are interesting decisions to be made. We had some interesting theory-crafting around starting factories, speed of local market sales, and consolidation frequency. Raised to an 8, but limited to 4-player only.

10/15: I'm interested in playing this game again. It plays like Russian Railroads if it was designed by the Panamax guys. Lots of interlocking systems and bonus chits galore with a few obvious paths and glimpses of others. The tempo of short-term and long-term planning feels just right. I wish there were a player-controlled way to speed the game, so that there was another tension between short and long-term strategies.

One of the best from WYG. It does not bring nothing new or very exciting and the area control is the only way to win the game. Trains and shipps worth a lot.

Had looked forward to this game for a while because of the Essen hype and my love for Madeira and it is a winner indeed.

[b]What I like about it:
[/b]
- The meeple selection mechanic is rather brilliant and offers very meaningful choices every round. Do you take the action you want even if you get a meeple of a wrong colour that will limit your next income? Do you take suboptimal actions to keep from consolidating early and in turn get a better bonus? Really nice choices. There is quite a bit of luck involved here, which is OK. There are also plenty of opportunities for screwing with the other players, which is nice.

- Quite a lot of interactivity both in the meeple selection proces and in the area control aspect of the game.

- Quite a bit of randomization in setup and in drawing meeples from the bag, makes it more difficult to make standardized strategies.

- Lots of end bonus scorings mean that you don't really know whos winning until the end. Keeps it exciting for most players.

[b]What I don't like:
[/b]
- There seems to be quite a bit of a starting player advantage. Don't know HOW big the advantage is because I have only played it once.

- The game seemed just a bit short. There was barely time to get any engine going. Mind you, this is something that most engine building games these days have in common, so this is a very minor complaint.

[b]Is it better than Madeira?
[/b]
Not for me. Nippon is substantially lighter and I tend to prefer deep heavy games.

[b]Is it better than Panamax?[/b]
No idea, since I haven't played Panamax. However, Panamax is now very high on my list of games that I want to try.

Overall, a very good game indeed.

Update after a few more plays: My wife doesn't enjoy the game and thinks that there is just too much going on. She dislikes the are majority element and used the phrase "complex for complexities sake". I still really enjoy the game and LOVE the worker action selection mechanism. I also really enjoy the puzzle of optimizing your coal and money usage, and balancing this vs. consolidation.

What an awesome game this is! 
To think that I almost sold this game because I couldn't find a group to play the game with just make me the shivers. I found the right crowd the invited me to play Kingsburg and we have a blast. Today I brought Nippon to my new found group and we had a 4 player game and what a bloody terrific time. I think that the game is so much better than Kingsburg as there are a lot of tough and meaningful decisions to make like do I consolidate early and get income and coal or should I wait to consolidate and get those big multipliers for the end game. Go for the action that I want now or go after another one to match the color of your workers ... Go after boats and railroads or increase your knowledge to go after the big factories.... awesome, awesome stuff. Nippon will have a very special place in my collection and I want to play the game again. Furthermore, the score was close the difference of victory points between the second and 4th place was 2... The winner --yours truly-- won at the very end by having big multipliers and by knocking an influence of the guy that was looking to be the winner on my last turn!

We played this as the BGG con hot games area was closing, so went into hyperspeed mode and shoved the game into an improbably short period of time. The downside was that much of it is a fuzzy memory blur, so we need to revisit. It is an interesting economic game though, with the usual tradeoffs between production, majorities, and resource generation.

I went to Essen this year having not even heard of this game. However after sharing a taxi from Dusseldorf with one Paul Grogan and hearing what he had to say about it I decided to go and get a copy. As with any recommendation from Paul, I was not disappointed. This is a fantastic game. 

This is a proper heavy euro, the theme is absolutely wonderful and the gameplay is fantastic. It features a 'reverse worker placement' mechanic which works really well and I like it a lot; essentially you take meeples from the board to perform an action. It also features a mechanic where you pay wages based on the number of different types of worker used, not simply the number of workers. This means you end up looking for paths through the game that I've never experienced with a heavy euro before.

In short, this is a brilliant game and if you can get your hands on a copy you won't be disappointed.

From the rules, you think this is going to be a very long slog of a game, and there are a lot of thorny rules. But it plays very quickly and smoothly, maybe 25 minutes pre player for a first play, and the turns are quick and many times you can go as the person before you executes their action. 

Not a ton of interaction, but as the board fills up toward the end, it can become somewhat vicious, and you do have to pay attention to colors people are taking. The action selection is interesting (calling this worker placement seems to stretch the term into the meaningless - I think of worker placement as action claiming, and here you can never be shut out of an action.) All in all, I think after a couple of plays this will be super-filler length for a pretty meaty game. Nice effort.

Heavy euro that looks daunting at first glance but is rather straight forward. The mechanics blend together nicely. The area control aspect really needs everyone's full attention, otherwise someone could run away with the game. I like the penalty for using diverse workers. It really keeps players thinking about which action to take. Something I would definitely like to keep playing.

Good, but not great. I was very excited during my first 1-2 plays, but this excitement slowly waned, as I realized that some parts of the game are less important than others. And I am not talking about the area control mechanism, which is key to the game, this is given. I am talking about elements that seem underdeveloped and not worthwhile pursuing (2 VP placement bonus areas, knowledge track,...). A good game, from a favorite designer, but not one that I need to own.

+ extremely clever area control mechanism
+ the limited influence tiles create lots of delicious complications
+ the consolidation action gives an interesting timing element to the game
+ money is nicely tight
+ the game seems well balanced
+ players have influence over when the game ends, which is always a fascinating mechanism
+ lovely art, as usual from Mariano Iannelli

= the cardboard components were not easy to punch out and the player mats are already bent
= the meeple selection mechanism seems ok, just nothing special

- the factory powers seem unexciting
- some parts feel underdeveloped, or of lesser importance
- the game feels a bit long and repetitive towards the end
- although the end game scoring bonuses allow you flexibility over what you score, you don't really set up your scoring goals, you just slightly manipulate them

Played it in Essen. First of all let me thank to the designers. Great work explaining the game. The game was explained to me by one of them and then the other helped with some details.

Game is very fun to play, fast paced and really thematic. Bought it immediately after playing it. Probably the best game of the show this year.

Regrettably I was made to play another 'involved' game of the WyG? stable despite declaring after ZhanGuo that I wouldn't anymore. But someone insisted, and I gave in. To make a long story short: if you like the kind of games WyG? has been putting out of late then Nippon will certainly press all the right buttons anew. Go out and play it if you haven't already, then. 

So where does that leave people like me, who don't like the new shiny bling? Well, in game feel it would appear that ZhanGuo and Nippon don't differ all that much. Both offer elaborate structures and routes and obfuscated VP gathering mechanisms with emphasis mostly being on learning the ropes rather than working out some clever strategy. My lesson learnt was that it really doesn't much matter who is getting what multiplier as the base number of VPs to be had in every catergory is equal across the board. Shortage of multipliers and an interdiction to change what is already placed do the rest. The points come in from the (hard to read) main board where a majority game takes place... literally by totalling numbers to work out the amount of influence. Yay. In the end it's not really a dysfunctional game, of course, but at the same time my fellow players and I wondered where the long-time attraction was supposed to be hiding. The worker mechanism is cute, but so prohibitively expensive that I genuinely wonder if you'd ever try an extremal strategy of [i]I pick the actions that I want and damn the cost[/i] apart from the novelty factor. What then remains is a contrived majorities game; not a bad thing to have anno 2015, but compared to the clean designs of yesteryear not really necessary to play nor own. 2015 was also the year Mexica, 3rd in the famous Mask Trilogy, got a reprint: I suggest you turn to that game instead, with its far cleverer combination of gerrymandering and parasitic VP leeching, for your majorities fix, and leave the cutesy worker selection to a genuine worker placement game.

Hay tendencia al AP y más en los últimos turnos, sobre todo a los que les gusta apurar como sea para rascar la máxima cantidad de puntos posibles para desesperación de los demás jugadores.
El juego es entretenido, pero para mí no es el juegazo que he oido por ahí. Me quedo con el Signorie de la misma editorial, aunque por fortuna, no tienen nada que ver.

I'm still chewing on this one. The area-majority competition has different dynamics than any I've seen in other games, due to a variety of factors (see [listitem=4298598]this GeekList entry[/listitem]), and I really like the multiplier-based scoring system. It doesn't shout loudly for me to play more, but I certainly would be happy to explore it given opportunity.

While mechanically the game is sound, it is a bit fiddly.  The limited area of influence tokens feel a bit contrived.  Between these tokens, only bumping small tokens, and only 1 good being able to be placed in certain locations it feels much more like you are competing with the game and your own engine, than the other players.  

Would play again if a very good friend was very excited about the game.

Nippon has an unusual worker displacement mechanic, where you remove a worker from the common pool to perform an action, but that's the only original thing here.  The rest is your standard melange of area control, upgrades, and bonuses.

Solid and competent, but it just doesn't stand out from the crowd.

An excellent game with lots of new ideias.

As in other games of industrial development, the player must well balance its production and its investments, trying to keep some money to buy raw materials (coal) but trying, at the same time, not losing the chance to invest the money earned, at risk of losing it. 
The new feature here is that, beyond that balance, there are also "production trecks" of knowledge and money (like science and culture trecks in "Trough the Ages") that must be also developed.
Other great and new ideia about the game´s mechanics is that there are no turns in the game: The players go allocating workers from a common bank to realize actions until they decide (or are forced) to stop to perform a "reset" action (to produce goods and cash in).
There is also great interaction between the players as they compete to occupy the same (and limited) spots of trade in the different regions of the map (the spot you need may be occupied earlier by another player).
A minor drawback of the game is the not so intuitive drawing tiles of the factories features, forcing often to consult the rules or asking buddies about its meanings.

[Sep 2016] - 8 (2 plays)
Fast paced economic simulation during Japan's industrial revolution. The number of turns in the game is primarily controlled by how quickly the workers are depleted from the main board. For the most part you'll be developing industries and selling goods to Japan and abroad. The tough decision involves timing when to perform consolidation. Too late and you might end up paying more wages. Too soon and you'll blow a turn. It's a fun game that does play in about 45-60 minutes per player. Decisions seem to slow down as the game goes on. Scoring is straightforward and not very complex. Very streamlined. If you do decide to play this, make sure you watch the rules overview video at Gaming Rules! Superb learning aide that is very well done.

[17 Jul 2017] - 7.25 (6 plays)
Realized that for 2 players, I had been using too many workers in the market. After correcting, the game goes much faster and leaves you wanting more turns to get everything done. Chaining actions become critical with the reduced turns and many opening actions can seem scripted. Ignoring the demand in Japan isn't an option and shorter consolidation cycles are probably a better option in the beginning of the game. Dropped the rating because as we play, it's less of a brain burner game and more about the tactical decisions on when to consolidate and making sure you're keeping up with the leader.

[17 Aug 2017] - 7 (7 plays)
Just realized that we had been doing the endgame scoring wrong for 7 plays. It's subtle and not in the rulebook next to the rest of the endgame scoring but you need to run through a limited consolidation process that's documented on the reference sheet (WTF) before you run through the player selected scoring. Separating out that key rule from the rest of the scoring rules seems like a horrible decision and one that does change what players would do headed towards the endgame. The layout of the rules could be clearer.

[27 Nov 2017] - 7 (13 plays)
Finished off this for my 2017 10x10 challenge. I get the various rules and mechanisms but can't seem to figure out how to string them together in a great engine. By this point I'm sure every rule is correct and I've scoured the forums looking at good openings to try. When I'm not killing myself to play 100 heavy games in a year I might pull this one out and try to pick apart a two player solo game to see where I'm going wrong.

What’s Your Game published the pinnacle of a complex Euro when they launched the incredible Madeira into the world. Maderia was designed by Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro and Paulo Soledade. And here we have the same publisher and the same designers back together with a new game...and by that Madeira yardstick will they be forever measured. 

Nippon is a solid Euro but is ain’t no Madeira. There is a very clever action selection mechanism whereby you take a coloured meeple from the action area, and the more different colour meeples you collect the higher the cost of the action.

That aside we have here in essence an area majority game, with some other multiplier scoring mechanisms thrown in to give some balance. Area Majority is not a personal favourite of mine so this will bias me a little against Nippon, and the other scoring areas are cleverly designed to allow you to compete even if you are not winning in the area majority scoring, so there is more than one strategy to follow.

It all works well, seamlessly and enjoyably. It is missing that something which moves it toward a real memorable game. Is it a keeper? It needs more plays but at the moment it might not be. 

Of the Essen 2015 Euro crop it certainly is dwarfed by Mombasa and Haspelknecht in my eyes.

It's an ok game, but it's dry.  Dry.  Dry dry dry.  Shame since the cover is soooo beautiful.

I'd play it again, but this one won't ever make my shelf or be on my "want to play" list.  I just didn't find anything interesting here.  You go through the motions, you find out who won, but it doesn't engage you.  It's not really because it's pointless, either.  You can pick up a really big rock and toss it in a lake and wait for the satisfying kerplunk as it carves a hole into the water - totally pointless, but satisfying.  Nippon is less engaging than that timeless activity so I'll leave it to the robbits.

Players must act creatively in order to truly excel in this game. You have to manage your finances, coal, factories, influence, trains & boats, machinery, knowledge, contracts, and more. Though there are certainly several ways to complete any small task, the game at large doesn't vary much from game to game. Acquiring a strong grasp on the strategy is difficult and worth exploring, but offers very little once players achieve that level of experience.

Yet another outstanding euro-game from this team -- I love both Madeira and Panamax, and this is right up there with them.  The "worker-takement" mechanism is a delightful and unique twist, fitting in nicely with this game's many interacting parts and  multiple paths to victory, and playing into your efforts to find/develop the best synergies possible among them as things unfold.

A fantastic economic and area control game that utilizes a clever “worker displacement” mechanism allowing players to control the timing and pace of the game, which creates a ton of tension and makes the game feel somewhat like a race.  

Nippon is a tight, medium-heavy (and accessible) euro that has plenty of strategic depth, but is narrower in its decision space.  Be warned though, this is a euro that has teeth.  The fight to control the industrializing nation of Japan can get bloody.  

My only gripe, which is more of a production quality issue than anything else, is that the player boards and game board came warped out of the box and the game board is now creasing funny... irritating.  Also, I thought the "placeholder" artwork was fantastic!  Why the change?  The game is good enough that I can overlook it but a "deluxe" version of the game with the (hopefully) coming expansion would be awesome.

For the most part, I like the game as my style of euro. My concern is seeing a friend win the game with a score of 220 points (way ahead of the rest of us) in a way that makes me wonder why I wouldn’t do that every game. 

He eschewed the level 2 factories and did a series of “increase knowledge, increase knowledge, consolidate” short turn cycles to get into level 4 Knowledge and then only bought the level 4 and 6 factories such that his area majority chits were much better than those of us messing around with the level 2s. I think the idea of the level 2s is to use them to fulfill contracts, but contracts are not nearly as important as board scoring, so I can’t see myself ever bothering with them again in future games except at game end for excess goods that I want to use. 

The game is just too short to mess around with the level 2 factories. In fact, I think the prices for the factories should have been staggered to reflect the lower to higher qualities of them -- or the bonus powers should have been set as more-to-less powerful for the level 2-4-6 factories to make buying the lower ones more tempting. 

As a result, I want to try the game again to see what happens if we all do that, but after seeing him eviscerate the game, it feels partially solved.

RATING: 6.75
For two player this can (provided the various bits of factory selection, demand, and actions selected line up) get cut throat between two people.  The competitive nature of the game probably comes out more in higher player counts.

The randomness of the meeples forces you to balance between the engine you're trying to build to affect the area control aspect and opportunistic points.  

For our two player games our avg score is mean + one standard deviation almost exactly and it's generally a one random decision action decider.  One random decision, any decision, could have rendered a different outcome.

This is rather unsatisfying and has lowered the score substantially for this game.  Folks aren't walking away from a finished game feeling like they've gotten something additional from the experience.

It's still a good game.  It's just not a great one.

After 3 games still unsure about the rating.
After the first game I would have given it a 9.
After the 2nd it went down to 5 when I realised that in the last round a fellow player can totally screw up your final scoring
After the 3rd game I now realised that you can - at least to some extent - prevent this. However, this would require checking the action possibilities of each of your fellow players. This is of course not a negative aspect per se, however, in this game it would lead to severe AP. And this is not really for me.

Nippon is really just more of the Madeira malady. It is a very simple area majority system at the bottom with various layers of complexity for complexity's sake laid on top of it. One point that irks me in particular is how the game seems to try to force some interaction (by providing few spaces for placing influence and allowing to overbuild other players) but then adds so many restrictions for actually placing influence that the interaction that does happen resembles a random drive-by shooting far more than intentional play. Subtlety certainly isn't one of the game's strength.

WYG bleibt sich seiner Linie treu: NIPPON ist ein Abendmonster, ein Godzilla des Überblicks, Hirntod für Grübler. Dabei ist der zentrale Worker-Displacement-Mechanismus mit japanischen Leiharbeitern hübsch und simpel und im Spannungsverhältnis zwischen Engine-Überlegungen und Mehrheitenspiel gelungen. Eine spieldesignige Verwandtschaft zu Vital Lacerda ist unverkennbar. Man scheint sich gut zu kennen in Portugal. Doch während VL der rotweinigen Liebe zum persönlichen Thema frönt, verlassen Paulo und Bizarro das thematische PANAMAX und gehen den Pfad der nackten Abstraktion. Verzichtet man darauf, NIPPON zu zerdenken und spielt das taktische Momentum, das NIPPON in seinen Planspielen erlaubt, dann wartet ein Erlebnis für welches der Begriff Expertenspiel erfunden wurde. Ein Wermutstropfen Blut bleibt: das einst liebliche Asia-Art-Artwork des Prototyps wurde einer bronzegebürsteten Darstellung von Japan geopfert, was dem Spiel eine zarte Ebene nimmt, die der grünblaukalten Abstraktion gut getan hätte. Die konsequente CI von WYG ist im Falle von NIPPON die verpasste Gelegenheit von Poesie.

Nippon has now set the bar for when a Euro goes toooo far with Euro mechanics.  Nippon is so much a spreadsheet manipulation game.  There is nothing about the graphics, theme or other game mechanics which can save it from its obviously clear "serve the spreadsheet" ethos.  So many weird rules and bloat that is just there to restrict and confound the player into being as optimal with its often arbitrary design.  Nippon does have an interesting "worker removal" mechanic which works well, but it has no connection to theme in the slightest. I can see where parts relate to each other, but Nippon feels heavy in areas that it shouldn't and way too light in areas that should feel more developed.  Maybe one of the driest examples of a Euro I have ever played (and I'm a huge Euro fan!)  And it's a boring game. I recognize that it is well-rated by a good number of people, so I know this is more my opinion than anything else.  Certainly there is a good game in here if this is what you are looking for. But holy moly will I never play this or a game like this ever again. Playing Nippon really woke me up to what I need to look out for in a rulebook before I commit to playing.  (Truth be told, I asked to play a copy of a friend's game who had already said they were getting rid of it.  They were good enough to let me try it out before putting it on the market.)

RATING: 4
This is a relatively complex, heavy Euro that IMO is more complex than it needs to be. 

It also has a lot of chaos - situations where player interaction creates effectively random outcomes, where who gets helped and hurt is more a side effect than a direct intention. The worker removal mechanic and choosing who to overlay on the board are two places where this happens a lot. As a result, you can end up behind through no fault of your own and there isn't much in the way of catch-up mechanisms. And it's a long game.

One play so far.  It was enjoyable, but not overly impressive.  Lots of interesting options and different paths to pursue, and consolidation was delightfully clever.   However, the overall objectives were just a bit too abstract.  I like area control a lot, but that's not really what this is.  The limited set of control tokens was different, but not much fun and downright frustrating when making a newbie mistake.  Overall, a clever Euro, but not the most exciting.  I would play again if asked, but I won't be the one asking.

Opinion: fall in love with the game, how the actions are selected and the consolidation phase are done is lovely. Keep in mind that this is a control area game, although the bonus you get during the game are a good boost at the end, the main VP's are scored through the areas. One thing you have to take into account is that the game can suffer of king making, if someone run away in the first scorings, could be the target of other mean players. Despite this, this is an awesome game with many ways to go for your goal (area control, bonuses, contracts)

I enjoyed the way the different colours of workers make your decisions of what actions to take more difficult each turn. Choosing which factories to build is also very tough - do you go for an instant bonus or something that could pay off better in the long term. Choosing what goods to make is also tough, depending on what the other players are doing, the layout of the board, and what bonuses you want. Very fun game.

Essen'15
Euro econòmic amb mecanisme de selecció d'accions similar a La Villa (meeples/cubs de diferents colors que vas agafant del taulell per fer diferents accions). Es puntua per majories, i aquestes majories s'asoleixen afegint influencia a determinades zones del taulell (ciutats) pagant un cert nombre de un tipus de recurs determinat. Per aconseguir aquests recursos, es necessiten fàbriques i materia prima (tot es fa mitjançant accions: aconseguir materies primeres, construir fàbriques, produir, etc...).

El joc en si no té mala pinta, però em dona la impressió que no deixa de ser un euro mig, sense res massa destacable. Possiblement el jugaria una o dues vegades i el vendria. En certs aspectes, em recorda al Vinhos (que em va passar exactament això que comento).

Opinió després de jugarlo: bon joc econòmic, amb un mecanisme de selecció d'accions molt ben fet i que té interacció. Tot i això li veig alguns problemes que em tiren enrere a l'hora de comprarlo:

- A la puntuació de cada zona, només puntuen els 3 primers (comptant amb la "maquina"), independenment del nombre de jugadors... Tenint en compte les poques zones que hi han i que només es fan 3 puntuacions durant la partida, quedar fora d'algún lloc és massa dur. Per fer-ho bé crec que haurien d'haver-ho fet escalable en funció del num de jugadors, de manera que tots puntuin.

- Les fàbriques, contractes, etc... sempre son els mateixos. Això pot fer que el joc es torni repetitiu i que hi hagi alguna estrategia més bona que una altre (similar amb el que pasa amb l'Arkwright però més lleu).

- Que et puguin fer fora d'una zona sense rebre cap compensació a canvi és massa penalització. Això provoca que tothom jugui a assegurar i només coloquin les losetes més altes (3,5 i 7), les que no es poden treure...

Played one and a half session during SPIEL15.

I like the big "industrial" feel. The variety of factories is a bit intimidating; the shared board/market is tight and interesting; the worker and action selection mechanisms are straight-forward.

All in all a very good game that I'd like to explore more. Due to its relative weight, I'd have a hard time getting it to the table, though -- so I haven't got a copy.

The artwork is mostly functional and good. I was disappointed by the map design though.

Played it online a bunch: perhaps my favorite What's Your Game title now. Madeira is a more grandiose game, but it's also painfully headache inducing. Nippon is a little more forgiving and pleasant to play.

Great mechanics but I'm not convinced that the different strategies are all as balanced as they could be. I also feel I'd like the blueprints to be multifunctional by say allowing you to cash them in to bump up the number tile which you place in a region - this would stop your 3s on the level one buildings from being entirely safe

It's better than I was expecting it to be with 3/4... but I'm still not entirely sure there are multiple paths to victory and hence I'm knocking it down from 8.5 to 7.5.

After 20+ plays on BGA I can confirm the dominant strategy is to go for the 5 Yen factory right at the start, then buy 2 Machinery, sell to Region 2 (if possible), produce a second time and then carry out a contract

Failing this (assuming another player went first and took it), then I just start by buying 2 machinery, then up on the Coal track twice, that should leave you with 3 meeples - enough to snatch up the 2 blueprint bonus with the 2 multiplier and it should reset you for an opportunity at buying a middle tier building. If you keep selling into region 1 then you can survive with little or no knowledge, just keep picking up those blueprints.

Other strategies just aren't worth bothering with. Paper is especially rubbish!! I mean if you get high on the knowledge track then great you can build more factories, but without enough coal and money you won't have enough resources or meeples to actually run the damn things... And that's basically my point, these 2 tracks are essential and it's unlikely you can invest in getting to the top of all three while also dominating on the board.

Finally ships/locos/machinery all have the same cost - but machines are clearly FAR superior and ships are pretty good too. How did they really come to the decision to have them all the same cost?

Her står det mellom Madeira og Nippon. Madeira er litt mer komplekst og har "Objectives", Nippon er litt enklere men har ikke "Objectives" (Sandbox game). Begge er dog regnet som "Heavy Euro Games" og har samme utviklerteam.

I guess this is what passes for a top flight Euro these days. It's about starting with money and coal and using this to create factories and goods which lead to majorities on the board. It's perfectly competent by the standards of most Kickstarter releases, but it just feels a bit 'loose', it's a bit too easy to make progress even without much of one critical resource (like coal). A Kramer design (which to some extent this resembles) would have been much tighter. Bottom line is though, when a game takes 30 minutes just to explain, it's too complicated.

This is a themeless euro that has some fun to it.  It took me a game or two to understand what was going on, then I had a number of pretty fun games, and finally that fun started to decrease quickly.  It seems like there are only a few opening routes to victory unless you try to force a different route and get really lucky, and the variability from game to game is too minimal (the board barely changes and the meeple positioning isn't exciting enough), hurting replayability.  After 10-15 games, I had little desire to continue playing new games of it.

It was OK.  Very tight actions.  If you mess up one, you probably won't win.  If you mess up two?  You'll lose by 20 points.

I feel fairly confident after one play that chasing the white track is folly, doing Railroads more than once is probably folly, and buying machinery is unquestionably the best choice early.  It's so important anybody that doesn't do it probably won't win.  Also, the regions are nowhere near balanced with the 2VP and 5$ ones being vastly better.

Really fun, open game. Definitely a game where you can choose what you want to focus on at the beginning. I was hoping that the colored workers would add something to the decision-making, but honestly it seemed like most of the time there were one or two actions you needed, and so at that point you were just hoping for a good color. Plus sometimes you consolidate right before a board reset and at that point you're picking your first color somewhat blind. This should happen fairly evenly to everyone and getting one extra color isn't the end of the world, so I'm not saying it's unfair or too much luck, it just felt like it should have been an opportunity to add an extra dimension to your decision and in practice it didn't seem to. I did really like how the different factories have different bonuses on them and since they're sort of themed that might lead you toward certain products over others. But since the desires of the populous are also randomly assigned each game and different areas come with different bonuses, this might also guide you toward one area over another. Really interesting game and I'm looking forward to trying out other strategies in the future.

This is definitely an interesting medium-heavy weight game. It's not ground-breaking but it's worth a spot on the shelf and very much in the "What's Your Game?" wheelhouse.

Nippon has some fantastic mechanics, namely the achievement-based bonus scoring structure and the way players attempt to minimize monetary penalties when retrieving workers during action selection. Mechanics like these are wrapped into some solid engine-building gameplay. Unfortunately, all this wonderful design is wasted in simplistic, completely uninspiring area control mechanics where the majority of the game's points are scored and entire engines can be crushed based on the whims of players. This makes Nippon one of the most disappointing games I've played.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2017)

What's Your Game? is perhaps my favorite game company and they haven’t let me down yet with any of their tittles, Nippon isn’t the exception, I like it a lot. I also love Madeira so I was keen to try Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro and Paulo Soledade´s last game.

Nippon is a medium weight Euro game with very interesting decisions.

The rules aren’t complex, but there are many of them. You can teach the game in about 20 minutes and you can play it in around two hours. 

The theme is ok but nothing exciting.

Best with 3 players but I would play any player configuration.

The game decision’s aren’t obvious in any way. In each turn you have only two decisions to make, to consolidate or to take a worker, but that decision is not easy. It is painfully interesting and if you do take a worker you have many options to choose from (should I buy a new factory? which one?, should I advance in my knowledge track, should I advance in my coal track? Should I deliver some goods?, should I manufacture products? Which color of worker should I take?). It isn’t easy and I really like it. The game has a lot of depth I want to explore.

Bottom line, I really like Nippon and it is a keeper for me. It is a satisfying Euro game with meaty decisions and easy to teach/understand rules. I think I like it better than Signoire. What's Your Game? has produced another winner in my book.

Really, really impressed by the action selection mechanism in this game. Very nice balancing act between on the one hand taking workers in fewer colors and having less different actions available but paying less salary and on the other hand having more different actions available by taking workers of more different colors but paying more salary. Then there's the whole when to consolidate consideration to take in account and on top of that, the decision space is further influenced by which colors the opponents pick and which colors are in the worker-row (queue) that become available in future turns. Thats the good jummy euro deliciousness part. Now the rest of the game felt a bit lackluster same tedium euro mechanisms all over again. And as with many euro's the theme is very pasted on.

RATING: 6
Nippon is a game of the Japanese industrial revolution. Players are Zaibatsu, one of the four giant corporations competing to contribute the most to the industrialization of Japan. On a turn, players either select an action or consolidate. The game comes with many pawns in 6 different colors and these are randomly distributed in sets of 3 to each action box, each of which is a associated with 1 or 2 possible actions. To pick an action, a player takes a pawn from the action box of their choice, perform the action, and add the pawn to their player board, which can hold up to six pawns. The trick here is that when you consolidate - which you can do on any turn, but you must do when you've collected six pawns - you have to pay a maintenance cost for each different color you've collected. So you want to collect as few colors as possible, which potentially makes some actions more expensive depending on the colors that are available. This decision point is the best, most original part of the game. The actions themselves are pretty mundane - build a factory, produce goods, advance on income tracks, use goods to complete contracts, use goods to add influence tiles to the board, or add influence and point bonuses to regions. Nothing too special. Another interesting aspect is that the more pawns you return during consolidation, the higher end-game scoring chip you get to apply to an end-game scoring category of your choice.

It's great weighing the cost of the available colors for action selection and evaluating what colors might be coming up after the next bag draw based on what's been consolidated back into the bag to minimize your color differences and your costs. The rest of the game however feels really pedestrian to me.

Nippon is a good game if you like lots of ways to get VPs and a relatively short time to get it all done.  Manipulating things in order to control the timing of the scoring phases is important.  Scoring is area majority and multipliers like Concordia or Hamburgum.  Point salad games are not my thing.  Gamey timing manipulation is not my thing either.  Area majority is generally not my thing.

Nippon is a game that leaves you wanting to do more. You need coal, money, and knowledge. You need many factories, and upgraded factories. You need boats to score more points, and trains to help you score them in the first place. It's the classic Euro feeling of not having enough time/actions to do everything you want. 

This tension is exploited even further by the action selection mechanism which makes action efficiency expensive. To take an action you must select a meeple from the corresponding location, each location is associated with two actions and will have at most 3 meeples, and at least 1. Meeples come in 8 different colours. When you select a meeple you add it to your player board and perform the action, however you must eventually pass on your turn and do a consolidate action. You must consolidate if you have 6 meeples on your player board, but you can choose to do it earlier. You receive your income of coal and money when you consolidate, however, for each different coloured meeple you have you must pay $3, or 2VP if you run out of money. 

[center][ImageID=2708342 medium][/center]

So selecting an action isn't necessarily simple. You need to plan your future actions based on what you want to accomplish and which meeple colours are present on those actions. You also need to consider your right neighbor, because you really don't want to collect a colour of meeple they are interested in. For me this was the central source of fun (i.e. pain) in the game and was a bit of a mixed bag. I do really like the tight economy and the tension in action selection. However, I don't like the extreme left-right coupling, and I don't like how abstract and devoid of theme this action selection mechanism is. 

The consolidate action is important for another reason as well, if you have 3 to 6 meeples collected you will gain a VP multiplier of 2x to 5x. This adds to the pressure to take meeples even when their colours don't work for you. Each player board has several categories pictured and when you gain a multiplier you must assign it to one of the categories, once assigned you cannot move it and you cannot assign a different multiplier later. This creates some interesting decisions because it forces you to decide which categories you are going to focus on.

I found the game very enjoyable, and I am eager to play again and see what can be accomplished. There are several areas that you can focus on and the game gave me the impression of having a lot of depth to explore in that regard.

Portuguese-Italian design school, various complexly intertwined mechanisms. A central area majority element is combined with action selection, an economic system with two currencies (money, coal) and engine building (factories, knowledge). It seems mandatory in this design school that players define their endgame scorings themselves, a feature taken from Gerdts' rondel games.

Differentiating traits of Nippon compared to the authors / publishers previous games are the focus on area majority and the comparably clear strategic options.

RATING: 8
Brainburner with an exciting connection between worker drafting and income as the core of the game. This core breathes through timing of your moves. When to consolidate your business and when to let new workers enter the market and when to trigger end of the round, especially when causing scoring, are crucial decisions in this game. Victory points are generated by transforming raw materials into goods with which you are either peacefully fulfilling contracts or fighting for area majorities with additional end game scoring affected by your in-game consolidation decisions. This may sound boring, but the theme has been subtly integrated. You need to have diverse economy which in turn requires innovation and need to also strengthen your machinery and transportation capabilities throughout the game. Nippon is demanding both on strategic as well as tactical level and therefore I suggest not playing this with AP prone players. The game is set up with WYG's trademark passive color scheme which in this occasion supports the theme very well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I divide game mechanisms in 3 categories: action selection, actions, and scoring, which I describe as "how you choose what you do, what you do, and how the winner is determined". Nippon manages to give you interesting puzzles on all three fronts, without becoming overwhelming. It amazes me that a game this complex can be so straightforward. One pet peeve is the scoring tiles, specifically when it comes to your first game or two: assigning them really is a shot in the dark, and given their importance in determining the winner, they can really leave a sour taste in a beginner's mouth.

Heavy but fun worker removal game. Lots of interesting options... for example, in my first game I did a sub-optimal move... thus triggering the scoring phase before the opponent could execute the plan he had been forming for a few turns to wrest control from me in a certain region. So while the move itself was sub-optimal it did bring me lots of points!

Games like this, where you have lots of good and interesting choices, both blatantly obvious and some rather hidden, are quite fun ;)

For such a heavy game it also has a good theme. Altough the "bento" factory kinda... seems forced in? Was this actually a big industry back then? O_o

About the score... I rate this game a 7. I would've liked to give it an 8 but the scoring stopped me from doing so. It's just... up until the final round of (lots of) math you can't really know just how well you've done... I played quite well once but the score didn't reflect this. Then the final scoring phase triggered and after doing all the math I... came in first? The entire game I felt like an underdog and then I won? Huh?
I like winning but this... didn't feel deserved.
The problem is simple: the scoring system is, unless you're playing with robots, just not fun to constantly keep in your head and calculate. As such, just how well everyone is doing... isn't clear until the game is over.
And that I don't like. But still a great game! So it gets a 7.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

As is typical of What's Your Game productions, this one felt a bit overwhelming at first blush. However, this one felt like it fell into rhythm faster than other games by this company which was a pleasant surprise. Not quite as much of a mishmash of mechanics although there is still a fair bit involved within the game. Found the scoring aspect for the end game quite intriguing as you select which item you are going to score with a multiplier dependent upon how many workers you turned in when you reset. In addition, the salary aspect was interesting as you collected a base income minus $3 for each color of meeple used when you reset. Theme was largely missing - can't say I really thought immersed myself into the concept of industrializing Japan - it was all about points and manufacturing efficient ways to do this.

Initial Impressions: This is a mash of mechanisms that is pretty themeless, but it is a mash of mechanisms that still makes the game flow fairly smooth once you've played a few turns: take an action or reset, and you are trying to build factories to produce resources to deliver them for area control. While mechanically fairly different to Puerto Rico this game gives me a similar if heavier feel in that both have little theme but are easier to learn than they would seem, have a rather static setup each game but has a large decision space to try different strategies without just overloading you with actions the way Uwe Rosenberg does, have you building buildings/factories to give you abilities and produce resources with some being a little imbalanced (at least according to someone who has played Nippon like a hundred times), you don't want to just produce willy nilly (moreso in Puerto Rico), timing of the order of your actions is fairly important, and there is an above average level of interaction for a euro (in Nippon through the area control and the thematically illogical wanting to only collect workers of as few colors as possible).

Hoped for really different paths to victory, but the majority scoring on the main board is more important than all the other scorings, so it's more like majority scoring with some minor options in other ways. Also pretty fiddly to set up the game. Main action selection and consolidating mechanism is great and I'd like to see more of it.

A couple things do bother me about this game.  The theme is really not all that strong and the bonuses given to factories make no real sense.  Also, I'm disappointed by the artwork; I'd have preferred it more in the wood block style common in the early Meiji Period.  Artwork aside, the game play works very well for my wife and I.  Select a worker, take one of the two corresponding actions, end turn.  It moves quickly and even the "consolidation" action doesn't take that much more time.

I really like this game, it is one of my favorite Area Majority games and on route to being one of my favorite top 20 games.  It has the right amount of crunchiness/intuitiveness/complexity/openness ratio for me that it feels fresh and interesting every time.  Downtime is small, choices matter.  The graphics and components are beautiful the iconography is excellent.  The rules are easy to remember.  Unless i will discover after many plays some game breaking mechanism, it feels well tested and it works well.  The scoring of the achievements at the end keeps players guessing about the final position and fighting till the end.  The main problem with this game is the amount of time it takes to explain the rules to new players and the fact that some players will be overwhelmed by the rules details and some parts of the game the first time they play, which limits the opportunities to bring it to the table.  The game has a long setup/takedown due to the many bits. 
 Also, the game easily plays longer than advertised, over two hours in 4 players, and later in the game the downtime between turns does get longer.  Small pickings, what the designers have accomplished it's remarkable.  I usually like games with more elegant rulesets, this is the exception, I really like this game and it really fits me like a glove.

Madeira I made eyes at you but my mind made me look away for the sake of sanity. Panamax we met and had a few moments together and it was fun. 

And then came Nippon. What a great game. Easy to learn and teach. Nice to look at and the smooth gameplay and surprisingly lightness of weight seems to be the product of a refinement process by the developers of all three games (don't get me wrong it's not light but it also doesn't feel like you're Samson after a haircut trying to hold the weight of Dagon's temple as it is collapsing on you). It is the one I like the most ... but I never did get around to playing Madeira so take that opinion with a pinch of salt.

Industrialisation of Japan has never been so much fun. I really like the way the individual actions you can choose from on your turn (from memory there are 9 of them) all seem different but some how seem to riff off of the same core game mechanics so are easy to pick up and remember. I also really like the way the game leads you by the hand through the choice of factory's by only initially having the technology to build level one factories. The rest are so appealing but you learn the game as you develop your ability to build them. It is then that your decision tree opens up drastically as you start to looked concerned and bewildered at the level of foreign influence on your beloved Japan and work out more devious and efficient ways of kicking out the foriegners than your fellow Japanese players. But then sometimes you work out even more dastardly, devious and efficient ways to kick out your fellow Japanese players and that is even more enjoyable. It is about at this point that you happen to glance at the turn marker and realise that you only have 3 turns left and you have to spend one of them consolidating. You look at your work force and realise you have employed the United Colours Of Beenforgotten and it is going to cost you a fortune to pay for them all and this will mean you won't have the money to invest in trains, boats, coal, technology etc meaning you can't do the 500 other things you wanted to do in the two turns you have left.

The mechanic whereby you select a coloured japeeple (?) from the action spot you select each turn and then within 6 turns (your choice exactly when) you have to consolidate and pay money depending on the number of different coloured workers you have used is genius. Also very good is the fact that the longer you wait to consolidate the better the personal final score multiplier you get is. It is just difficult to know what you are going to be good at at the start of the game!


I have come to enjoy the game even more. It's fairly easy to explain and I really enjoy the decisions it leads you as a player to make. It does take a bit of a set up but it is really worth it and having a play time of slightly shorter than you would imagine from looking at its woodcut illustrated gorgeousness is a complete bonus.

These were both 3 player games and it works very well at this player count. I do have one observation of the 3 player game. It may be beneficial to play the waiting game when choosing factories at the 3 levels. If you can get into one type of factory that the other two don't have you may have a slight advantage as they fight it out for area influence with the same products. I say slight as there are so many other ways you can make the wrong decision and completely mess up a cunning plan that I am sure it all evens out!

... Oh and yes I have since ordered Madiera

RATING: 9
An entertaining mix of area control with economy management. The game has a lot of depth that can be explored only after at least several playthroughs. Do I want to get a same-color worker but do a less optimal action this turn, or do I sacrifice income but do what I wanted in the first place? Should I just consolidate instead so that I can better prepare for scoring or incoming worker groups? 
However, the game feels rather bland and quite dull (except for the box's cover) in terms of graphics; the theme I could not really 'feel' in my first game. Hoping to improve this on further plays.
Definitely cannot wait to play this game again and again.

RATING: 7
An area control game with a few twists--the worker placement (worker removal?) system is unusual and gives a nice pace to the game. The fact that you have a very limited number of tiles to put down means that you're constantly faced with interesting quandaries--it's sometimes better to retain positional flexibility by putting down a lot of medium- and low-value tiles rather than staking everything on a 7 tile (which you'll never be able to move from that point onward). The art is a bit dark and drab--it's hard to tell apart the numerous grey/black squares with the numbers 1 or 2 on them. Basically this is a very abstract game--sometimes too much so, as when foreign influences are represented merely by the numbers 1, 2 and 3 ringing each city. 

My main hesitation about the game is that some factories are vastly better than others, so there's a distinct first-player advantage: whoever goes 4th is going to get a subpar starting factory. (Also, why is there a knowledge track you basically never need to advance on past the 2 mark? As long as you're placing influence in region 1 you'll always have blueprints.)

RATING: 9.15
Playing one of the industrialist in Meiji period is a very interesting subject to me. Nippon is very thematic, and the worker displacement mechanic is very innovative. A lot of complain about the disconnect of the meeple color to the theme, but it actually makes sense as Japan opened it doors to outsiders, mix of people from different nations and background could cost problems, and this is abstracted in the cost you pay. Replayability is not a problem, as the area control market demand changes the game, forcing one to change their factory strategies. One of my favourite euros of all time

Just 1 play so far, but this is a nice medium-heavy Euro type board game.  Got one of the rules wrong which extended game play (only 3 turns per player  after 2nd scoring), but believe playing with correct rules would only make the game better (quicker and more tense forcing players to really focus on end game objectives).

After 2nd play with 4, this is a solid Euro brain burner.  Very good!

Fantastic Euro of supply and demand. Nippon feels like work, but it feels like "fun work," if that's possible. The worker displacement mechanism is really cool. It works much better here than it does in Signorie. Planning for consolidation is also interesting, as you want to make sure you time it just right. This definitely fits in the same line as games like Brass and Power Grid, but this feels more like a Euro game in economic clothing rather than the other way around.

Great game. Really enjoyed my first play of it. Nippon is for sure the best game from the team Soledade, Sentieiro and Mariano, and one of the best medium weight games I played this year. Probably one of the most well-accomplished games from WYG, just after Vinhos of course. :)

RATING: 6
Nippon is a surprisingly streamlined euro with quick and predictable actions which minimizes the downtime. It's basically an area control game, where you need to obtain influence majority in markets by delivering demanded goods. To do this, you need to set up an engine where you obtain money, coal and knowledge to invest in and run factories, trains and ships. A distinguishing feature is the action selection mechanism, where the actions are represented by workers in random colors and where you're never blocked but punished the more different colors you take. I particularly like that Nippon is not a point salad - you have many choices but they must all aim at controlling the markets.

I need more plays to assess whether Nippon is an interactive fight for market shares or rather a solitaire optimization game and I'm also concerned about the ability to catch up after a bad start. Nevertheless, Nippon stands a comparison with the classic euro games where you always feel that you don'thave enough actions for all your needs.

From the same designers of Madeira, comes the Meiji period of Japan where industrialization is taking place. Players first choose a colored meeple, then do the action associated with the location of the meeple: build factory, build ships, build trains, produce, advance on knowledge, advance on coal or perform contracts. You also have a choice to consolidate on your turn, paying money for different colored meeples you have chosen already, then you can start fresh.

It's a clean mechanic where you choose your action. There are multiple strategies which I like. I was afraid it was going to be as complex as Madeira, but this game is easy to grasp, and there are various things you can do.  There are so many tracks you can advance, and I don't think one track has a large advantage over another. I'm looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 7.5
First impressions after 1 play.
Love these mechanisms:
- long term strategy. Driven through area control and placement of multipliers for different bonus. These both are highly linked to which factories you buy during the game.
- High interaction through area control (ability to replace opponents'industries), limited factories, limited multipliers. In less degree, for same color actions.
Meh:
- Doubts about replay-ability. Only demand tiles change between games. Will it be enough to keep the game fresh?
- Too many multiplier tiles, it distracts and gives it a false sense of point salad that does not fit with the rest of the game in my opinion. Not a big deal, most VP come from area control.

My 2nd play did not show many new strategies to follow, I tried to go with low value factories and qty, but being limited in number, it failed big. Victory path seems narrow, go for the big factories ASAP

RATING: 7
Madeira was already among my favourite games, both for its delicious complexity and theme use. Nippon, admitedly, has much less theme: I get that almost everything here has a good explanation, but it sure doesn't feel like controlling Zaibatsus in Japan. On the other hand, it has such beautiful and smooth mechanisms, enough to make it almost tie with Madeira as my favourite Sentieiro e Soledade game. Perhaps the best way to describe how nice is to play this game is that it feels, as a friend mentioned, like a constant and smooth flow, without bumps along the way. Great game.

Not as intricate/obsession-worthy as their others (especially Madeira, but [i]especially[/i] Panamax), so I'm left wondering if they're downshifting to a more Feldian mode. Which is still solid, but they had helped to set the bar higher for the modern euro.

Gioco strategico interessante con dinamiche da approfondire. Partendo dai materiali confermo che la grafica del prototipo o per lo meno la cover che inizialmente pareva dovesse uscire mi piaceva molto di più. I materiali sono di buona fattura ma le banconote, molto graziose, non sono comode nel formato mignon. Anche gli indicatori per gli avanzamenti tecnologici risultano poco stabili e inclini ad errori. Parlando del gioco ho trovato il tutto molto interessante, la particolarità del colore dei lavoratori utilizzati rende ogni partita unica e mai banale condizionando anche le strategie da adottare. E' bello analizzare le diverse e differenti possibilità di conquistare punti vittoria anche se, a prima vista, mi pare che puntare sullo sviluppo sulla mappa paghi più che concentrarsi sui contratti. Mi lascia un po' perplesso la forte interazione che si ha sulla mappa permettendo di sovrascrivere la fabbrica altrui eliminandolo di fatto. Questa dinamica molto invasiva mi porta a valutare solo la costruzione di fabbriche non 'scalzabili'. Altro aspetto da approfondire e comprendere meglio è 'l'insalata' di punti di fine partita che distribuisce circa il 50% dei punti che si fanno in tutta la partita. Un gioco da rigiocare per approfondire meglio visto che mi lascia appetito per l'intricato sistema strategico ma un po' di amaro in bocca per gli aspetti che non mi hanno convinto del tutto.

C'mon... this is not a 3.75 complexity rating game. It is actually relatively simple for the interesting depth it offers. You can play your learning game with a 10 minutes overview. The wide horizon of choices... and combos... and timing... that can make the game fell challenging to play, even daunting. But I encourage people not into "heavy" euros to try it out with 4 players. It has a fast pace, it's not punishing, and you can all bash the leader if it's running away. Probably a good gateway to the heavier Portuguese euros.

Probably a highish 7 because there's some interesting stuff, but it's still very JASE. I like the payment mechanism where you often choose between paying more for an action you'd like to do over the actions you could take for effectively no cost. The buildings provide some interesting tech paths to explore to provide game to game variety. I'm not a fan of area majority, but at least here player put-downs are limited to the places which match their factories, so you can work out where you're under threat if you can be bothered to track other people's factory output. The occasional required personal re-set back to your base income / base resources provides something different ... spend it before you lose it. Turns are fast enough. Perhaps it felt a bit same-y after 2 hours (with 4 players) which is why it doesn't earn a higher rating, plus there's no theme immersion at all. Still, it's engaging enough to warrant decent play.

Deceptively simple mechanics combined with a variety of ways of winning the game equals a winner in my book. I haven’t rated yet because I still want to play it more but as of now, it is up there with some of Lucerta’s best games (which is saying a lot). My only complaint is the time length. With two players, it can be finished in a couple of hours but with four players, it overstays its welcome somewhat, so I am docking it a point.

It is a clever design and one that I am glad that I own. However, I am hoping that repeated plays will speed up game time,

Based on one play: One of those intertwined euros where you can get points in many ways however in this one there is a connection between all the methods to get points and you have a lot of control of what you go after. The interaction between players in fairly low, you chose from the same actions however you cannot really block anyone just make it a little more expensive for them. Where you can really influence others is on the main board where you sell goods as you are fighting for majority. Tough decisions and lots of control makes this a must replay for me.

Nippon was a very smooth-playing game for its weight. You're building factories that produce goods that can be used either in area control on the board, or to complete contracts. The real interesting part, though, is the action selection mechanism--each action has randomly-pulled colored pawns on it, which you take, and when you decide to get income, the more differently-colored pawns you have, the more your income is reduced. And, the more pawns you took before collecting income, the bigger end-game multiplier chit you were entitled to. It was pretty neat.

Well, WYG? does it again. A solid gamers game that is well developed. 

How things work are - for once - quite clear in this game: get knowledge to get factories, which you can improve to get more goods with a single run. Get coal to produce goods with your factory. Use this goods to either forfill contracts or to get influence. Built trains to add influence in a region were you already have influence or add ships to score more points when scoring 1st or 2nd.

The hard part in this game comes from the consolidate action, were you have to balance taking an extra action with a colour you don't have yet and starting with 3.000 Yen less, or to simply consolidate. But the hardest part from the consolidate-action is the fact that you will probably get an emperor reward and immediately have to decide were to put it. This implicates that in fact you have to know upfront (right from the start of the game)on which things you will focus and put over there a 4x or 5x multiplier.

The game also progresses much faster then you would imagine if you see those 30 meeples (with 4 players) at the start of the game. As in the beginning most of the players are sort of taking the same actions, those extra workers come in quite fast and before you know it, it's scoring time!

Difficult to start but easy to get into. "What's your game" game so it will most likely have complex rules and it did. Really well done and interesting mechanics. Choices to be made and paths to take. I really want to play again soon to get a full grasp. I played with a table that found it mediocre like other games by this publisher. I happen to really enjoy the games so you should try to play with people who enjoy the "WYG" gams. Definitely recommended.

While this game looks intimidating, it's actually a very simple game. The board has a map with different regions that all want different resources as a cost to place a marker in them. Then there are a few areas at the top where meeples collect. On your turn, you take a meeple from one of those areas, preform one of the actions below the area from where he was taken, then add the meeple to one of the slots on your board, where he takes up space. If you don't want to do an action, or are out of space, your turn is to reset, which is get new income, return your meeples to the bag, and then pay some money depending on how many colors of guys you chose to take. The game has multiple paths to victory, where you can chose to focus on the main board, or focus on building your player board. It's enjoyable, it gives you that nice feeling of never quite having what you need when you need it.

I have a mixed feelings about Nippon. I like it a lot and I would love to explore this game as much as possible, but due to longer playtime it´s hard for me to get it to the table. I love the theme (even though many people would call it bland), love the all kinds of factories you can build, very different approaches in strategy and so on. What I dont like is longer playtime (even 2p) and not enough tension with 2p in the area control part of a game - which is understandable and I have to say I actually like the rules fix for this matter.

RATING: 8
excellent game, with yet another interesting novelties and mechanics to keep it fresh. Would have given it a 9 if they however taken their time to properly design the game: it looks awfully bland, it's clear they rushed the graphic design of this game to make it in time for Essen. Inconsistenties in the colours of the goods/coal, and a player board that looks like a prototype board... WYG, you can do much better than this.

Very good heavy game. Select actions to build and run factories, fulfill contracts, increase income, prestige and coal, supply local markets (which provide area control for scoring), etc. -- all while trying to limit colors of pawns used, an interesting twist. The game plays quickly, is very balanced, and ends before you know it. Great theme, great production.

I bought this for another member of our gaming group for Christmas, as he generally likes economic games but prefers relatively simple rules and fast-moving games. From the reviews I read, this seemed like a good fit - and I think I chose well, because he likes it, and I like it too :)

It's quite close to the border between a 7 and an 8 for me, I'm staying on the side of caution for now, because I'm not sure how much longevity and replayability this game has. But it's certainly an interesting blend of typical Euro-style resource juggling and area control, with some really very tough decisions and yet generally very quick turns. I've only played twice so far, but would be more than happy to play several times again in the near future.

RATING: 8.3
(+) very original and clever 'worker takement' mechanic resulting in an interesting balance of freedom and restriction in the actions available to players. This drives the game smoothly and creates some subtle player interaction each turn

(+) Turns move quickly, little to no downtime and yet very interesting and meaningful decisions offered every turn

(+) The game grows: your income rises, new technologies become available, the points to be won increase - however, competition also becomes stronger. Nice build up

(+) accessible and structured rules, easy to teach and understand the game

(+) Some clever resource management going on, as you try to optimize the use of your stock in maximum 6 turns. Any left-overs perish afterwards before you receive your income. Also interesting that your influence tiles are very limited. All the while this game gives you the delightful (simulated :)) feeling that you are short on absolutely everything: coal, money, knowledge, influence tiles and... actions/time!

(+) Tense build ups when a scoring round approaches. Will players drive to ensue scoring early or late? This is potential for significant point swings!


(-) as always with 'What's your Game' titles, the gameboard is very functional with all relevant informant displayed and with well drawn graphics. However, this time, I'm not really drawn into the art, its style is rather dry with lots of tables and few 'thematic decorations'.

(-) There are quite a few ways to approach the game, but as majority scoring in the 4 Japanese regions delivers so many points, it seems impossible to neglect this aspect of the game. Luckily, to participate in this scoring the game will have forced you to invest in income, coal, knowledge/technology, factories, machinery, ... In my opinion, the freedom of strategies is mainly involved with the end game bonusses and the ways in which you build up your company, but not in the main way to generate points: whatever you do, some way of the other you need to invest in the home market.

(-) For me personally, the game might have lasted a little bit longer. However, the variable play time (depending on how often players consolidate and which actions are popular during the course of the game) is certainly an intruiging aspect of the game.

Conclusion: Very elegant and interesting euro driven by an ingeniuous 'worker takement' mechanic. It offers lots of intresting things to wrap your head around and certainly delivers. However, don't lose yourself in building up your company distracting you too much from the area scoring and be aware that this game with all its tables is a lot of fun to play, but not a lot of fun to watch. Congratulations to Nuno and Paulo: they have made one of the top games of 2015 (maybe the best?). To me, Nippon is the best game they developped so far (and that's saying a lot, as Panamax and certainly Madeira are amongst my favorites!)

Tip: In our (limited) experience, you can expect to consolidate about 5 times during a game.

Approx game time: about 30 min / player

Looking forward to this one. It only needs to be half as good as Madeira (by the same designers) to be brilliant!

And now I've played it. Very good game. The impact of the different coloured meeples leads to some very brain-burning decisions. (The more colours you take in your action selection, the more it will cost you.) There's a lot going on in the game, many actions, VP multipliers to collect, the "take that" element of replacing an opponent's influence, etc. I suspect that it will take several plays to reveal the full strategic depths of the game. Another very solid game from this design team.

RATING: 6.5
My first game of Nippon left favourable impressions primarily due to the action selection mechanism. It seemed to require careful balancing of the workers' colours, desired actions and the timing of consolidation. (I also liked how the word [i]consolidate[/i] rolls off the tongue.) 

But my second game dimmed those impressions somewhat. Players aren't really [i]that[/i] free to choose any action they desire, because the cost of taking on a third colour is far too great. At the same time, the decision of when to consolidate seems to be fairly obvious. (I still like to say [i]consolidate[/i] though.)

The rest of the game is standard Euro fare – convert resources to goods, then ship those goods out in an area majority subgame. At this point, I should mention that Nippon's take on area majority is a little problematic. Players have to preempt their opponents' capacity to overtake majorities, which in turn causes the final few rounds to drag. And as much as I like the idea of choosing the multipliers for endgame elements, this mechanism feels tacked on purely for balancing purposes. 

But unlike last year's Zhangguo, Nippon feels more thematically coherent and less complex for complexities' sake.

2017: 8. Only a few turns into my first game (playing online) and my brain is on fire. What others have said seems true : there's a lot to take in at first, but the game isn't too fiddly/exception-y so once the system is in your head, it appears to flow smoothly. In a live game, I expect I'd have some AP though, not in figuring out what action to take but what my next 3-4 actions will be plus a backup plan. The game sure makes you feel *really* smart when you do manage to chain your actions together with a near-monochromatic collection of workers!

TBD is whether to grab a copy; I'd love to have it but my local player pool for something this heavy would be limited.

RATING: 7
A good euro with an aspect of luck-pushing on what workers you take. Heavy for my tastes, but I enjoyed it. I think going language-independent (although I can imagine there were very good reasons to) means the game suffers from rulebookitis - we had to keep checking everything.

So many things for me to like about this game:  tough decisions, many paths to victory, meaningful player interaction (both subtle and overt), some fresh mechanics (timing your "consolidations" to maximum efficiency), a great marrying of gameplay with theme (which makes teaching the complex rules much easier) and wonderful art.

However, it is definitely not for everyone, not only because of the complexity but because of the overt fighting that is part and parcel to an area control game.  It fits right in my wheelhouse, though.

This game hits all the things I love about board games.  If you like games with open choices but maximizing each turn with the choices you make this is the game for you.  Reminds me of Orleans and figuring out the best strategy to get everything done but still score the points at the end of this game.  End game points is what you are working the entire game for with a few points given out during your turns.  Plays great with 2 players and in the end we were 2 points apart.

2 plays

This game has the look of Madeira (same artist, I'd guess?) but, although it's still a heavy game, play is more streamlined and simpler and much quicker. Our game, with all newbies, took just under 2 hours to finish.

It's an action selection game with a unique selection system, which also ties into its unique scoring system. Actions are paired, with each pair getting a random assortment of 3 colored meeples. You take an action by adding one of those meeples to your board. Later, the more colors of meeples you've chosen, the more you pay. Those meeples are also a game timer: after enough have been used, the game advances to the next Turn. Actions allow you to do a variety of things:
- advance on coal (to increase production) or knowledge (access to better factories) tracks
- buy a factory (6 types x 4, each with a unique power)
- buy factory improvements
- run up to 3 factories (each consumes 2-4 coal and produces 1-3 goods)
- make 1-3 deliveries (1-3 goods each) to one of the 4 regions on the board, or to a single personal contract (everyone has the same set available to them) for income/VP
- place ships (increased VP) or trains (adds to your influence in areas)
Every once in a while (1-6 actions), players have to "consolidate": discard all money/coal, earn coal/cash income, then pay the meeples they've collected ($3K per color). You also get a one-time bonus (2 extra coal, $5 cash, or 2 tech), and a 2x-5x multiplier (more actions taken = higher multiplier earned) to immediately place on a scoring category.

You earn VP along the way as you build factories and deliver goods. There are also scorings after every few Turns, rewarding VP based on presence (which you get by making deliveries) in each of the 4 regions, area-influence style. End game scoring is for a variety of things (every $6 cash, number of advanced factories you've built, progress on the tech tracks, etc.): each of these is multiplied by 0-5, depending on the multiplier you may have allocated to that scoring category. Most VP wins.

There is a lot to juggle here:
- which workers to take, and which to leave for your opponents
- which factories to choose (which affects your ability to enter the regions and play for majorities; also, the unique powers may direct you down a certain path)
- how to manage your timing: manage money/coal to use everything before consolidating, or cycle earlier to take better advantage of board position? make sure you can do what you need to do before that next scoring ... or maybe you should try to trigger it yourself?
- when you consolidate, which category should you choose for that multiplier?
- watch out for the end ... it'll sneak up on you!

Very fun game!

I had been wanting to have a game of this for some time and was not disappointed when I finally got the opportunity. A worker-placement game with an element of area control through building up influence, it offers a lot of different strategic options and it was not at all clear who would win until the third and final scoring was completed. As usual with What's Your Game? productions, the board tells you almost everything you need to know, so that once you understand the iconography there is seldom any need to refer to the rules
WYG say that the game is fast-moving , which is true - it is rather like a roundel game with a single action taken each turn, which will usually be pre-planned. A plan B has to be kept in mind in case the preferred worker has been snaffled, but AP is not much of a problem. The game is still likely to take 2 - 3 hours as it is clearly designed to allow long-term plans to come to fruition; it got quite hectic in the final rounds as pent-up money and influence were unleashed.
So, a satisfying game that doesn't make your brains leak out of your ears - it is possible to flounder through the first game quite successfully. Added to my list of favourites, but being quite long, it probably won't get played as often as I would like. If I'm proved wrong on that, I'll amend the rating upwards

It’s a fun and quite interactive efficiency race/area control game. I like the tough decisions on when to consolidate and to time your deliveries to the local markets just before the scoring phases.

The different colored workers and their impact on your economy will give each round interesting choices.

Two negatives lower my rating:
 
-	I feel that many of the factories are quite useless and will never be played which seems to be a wasted opportunity to give the game additional strategic directions.

-	Also I believe that a player will fall too far behind if they waste money and actions on upgrading the knowledge (white) track. Unfortunately it seems to be a trap for inexperienced players and I wish it was more to it.

A nice Euro where you gather workers types to do work for you and you must pay the number of worker types you use.  I mis-understood a rule at the beginning and ignored the onboard end of game bonuses and concentrated on my own board bonuses and lost handily.  It was an interesting experience with a solid new mech of managing your worker types, yet it was not intriguing enough for me to want to purchase this game.  I have so many of this style of game and the theme did not grab me and I have found out that is key for me between buying the game and not.  I will happily paly someone else's version as I am now starting into a major downsizing of my collection.

RATING: 7
Gameplay is not that difficult mechanically, but there are a plethora of options to consider.

Replayability looks good with unique factory abilities and the rotating City demand tiles (the "Outsider", non- player foreign interest at setup is an excellent design touch, quite thematic).

We found the all-icon player aid card to be kind of useless, but that's OK - the reference sheet (just 1 included, so you'll want to make several extra copies) clears everything up. I also have a balance concern in a few areas, but will need some more plays to fathom. 

Unfortunately this release has been lost in the crowd, and our group just doesn't table it often because it failed to register with most of us. [update: things have improved with a re-visit].

Definitely one of the best games of 2015.  Simple mechanics with great depth combine for a great slightly heavier than medium Euro experience.  The action selection mechanic (worker displacement, I call it), shines.  I couldn't decide whether I thought this game or The Gallerist was the best of 2015 - sooo difficult to choose (and then I played Mombasa, and the comparison became irrelevant).  Nonetheless, great, great game I can see myself playing for quite some time to come.  Top 3 of 2015, in my top 20 of all time, perhaps can sneak into my top 10.

Learning the rules was a bit of a slog, but the design is sound and the many features of the game became second nature shortly after playing a while. Interesting, little used mechanisms like consolidation which allows the players to be flexible regarding when their own set of turns is reset. Also interesting is how the victory point multipliers are set over the course of the game for each player individually at their choice. A bit fiddly with the many bits to set up and take down.

About [thing=154809][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
Is a medium-heavy game about the industrialization of Japan. It blends the development of an economic engine with an area influence/control, which is where the biggest points come from.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
[thing=154809][/thing] is a complex game, with several possible actions and many interlocking paths to make things work and go foward. The main parts are:

a) Players take meeples of different colors in order to do one of two possible actions that are available in the spot that the meeple was;

b) Actions are used to increase income of money, coal, knowledge; to build industries, trains, ships; to improve machinery; to produce in the industries; to fulfill orders; and to attend the demands of regions of Japan regarding types of products;

c) The only action not done by taking meeples is consolidate. When the player do this, he loses every coal and money he currently has, than receives his income of coal and money, than pays $3000 yen for each color of meeple he has in his board (this is why is good to take meeples of the same color). Also, if the player has 3, 4, 5 or 6 meeples when he consolidate, he can take a bonus token (blueprints, coal or money), which, after giving what is it, the token is flipped and becomes a multiplier for end of game bonus points.

d) When attending to the demands of Japan, the player fills spots on the regions that match the type of goods he is selling to japan. There are three levels of goods (1st: paper and silk; 2nd: bento and lens; 3rd: clocks and lamps), and each level, depending on the number of goods sold, influence the region in different amounts - for instance, two level one goods puts 2 influence, while 2 level three goods puts 6 influence. The types of goods the the regions are interested in is randomly set at the start of each play.

[thing=154809][/thing] doesn't have a set number of turns for a round to end - this happens when there isn't meeples to fill a space of actions. In the second time this happens, occurs the first scoring of regions, accordingly to the influence in them - the outside market (importation) has lots of influence early on, but loses space as play proceeds. In the fourth time meeples end, comes the second scoring. After the sixth time, player will have three more actions each, then will happen the third and final score. 

The player with the most points wins.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
There are dozens and dozens: which action to activate, which meeple to take; which industry to build (not only the type, which is already a big deal, as it will allow the influence of some regions and less, if at all, of others; but also every industry, even of the same type of good, has some different bonus for the player when build); when to rise income for money, coal and knowledge; when and where to build trains and ships; when consolidate (to gain money and coal, and, also, rewards and bonus multipliers); when produce; if attend the needs of the  foreign countries (normally to increase income of money and to gain some points or money) or using satisfy local needs (to influence areas and to gain some immediate bonus); how much to spend and in what; and others.

There is a good deal of timming in the game, which also weights in on the decision-making. Players are bound to have to make some hard calls during game.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Very rich in paths to follow;
- a complex game with depth, as is heavy on strategy: one action you might intend to do three, four turns from now, you will need to start preparing for it now, or it will be underused or even impossible to be done (normally for lack of money, coal or knowledge);
- almost everything works together well - just the meeples part seems disconnected with the others, but as a mechanic to add a layer in the choices, it works;
- isn't as long as one might expect for a deep game, ending in around 90-120 minutes;
- unique - even though the several mechanisms aren't new, the end result is a game that I can't really compare with others in pace and feel.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- A lot to learn for the first game - the explanation will take a while and can scare non-gamers;
- theme, while present, isn't very strong nor plays a big part in the game;
- the board is bland and the regions should have different colors;
- there is some luck in the meeples, considering colors and places they go, but, for the most part, good players will be able to work around or even use them for their own purposes, still, this speck of luck is there;
- little player interaction: it stays in "you took what I wanted" (for industries and rewards after consolidates) and in the area influence of regions.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like a busy industrial boss in Japan. No mean feat, I tell you. So many things to choose from, so much to juggle while trying to come up with profit and leave a mark in the market. None of the mechanics, by themselves, are hard to learn and to apply, but the overhaul of several rules has a its toll, weighting in the players.

In the end, [thing=154809][/thing] is a solid euro game, rich in paths to victory and with plenty of room for strategy and smart play, being also unique in this field of more and more similar games. However, you do play more the game than the players, the huge number of choices can lead to some AP and the theme isn't what it could be. Ovearll, a good game and one I recommend.

Provisional rating, one incomplete play at Spiel.  Does something that may be novel in the worker placement genre (i.e. worker removal), and it is the kind of wp I dislike less (i.e. quite forgiving), but behind that is a game we have seen before of building an efficient engine and balancing resource- and VP-production.

Seems very solid, but not that original. I also thought it was a bit long, but that could be because of the environnement of the fair.

Mid-heavy weight economic game with a lot of indirect confrontation. So much conflict between the players it almost felt like a wargame but somehow even crueller as the opponents just pull the carpet from under your feet :-).

This game is so unforgiving. The game really centers play efficiency and area majority with worker / action selection distraction. If you make a single mistake, you won't survive the game without your opponents' mistakes.
I love it how it's pretty much different with Madeira and Panamax.

Nippon has multiple disjoint mechanics, each largely transparent in its own right, and thus ends up being a game profoundly lacking in both elegance and opacity. Interaction is minimal, and the game doesn't have enough depth to sustain its length; there just isn't a lot of 'there' there. I understood exactly what was going on after listening to the rules explanation, which was a real turnoff (see above re: lack of opacity).

Nuno and Paulo knocked it out of the park again with this release. While not nearly as convoluted (in the good way) as Madeira, there is still quite a bit of deep strategy hiding out in Nippon. It didn't seem like there were many paths when I walked through the rulebook, but once we got the game to the table, it really came alive. While the paths seemed to be sort of straight forward, the worker removal mechanism provides a ton of tactical considerations that can really force you off the path. That and the fact that there is only one copy of each building required for each path means that players can't help but get in each other's way.

Honestly, while it is less complicated than Madeira, I have a hard time not saying that is every bit as good, and easier to teach, to boot. I haven't heard much about it post-release, but even though it is more straight forward than Madiera, it still has some pretty weird concepts, like throwing away your money and resource stockpiles every turn, which maybe answers my own question about the silence. Regardless, the low buzz will probably eventually translate into low prices, so make sure you grab a copy when the opportunity presents itself.

Very good ecomomic euro, you really have to plan ahead and optimize your moves in order to stay competitive. The mechanism of drafing workers of different colors and the whole scoring system are very clever and introduce a lot of tension to the game. 

The downside is that explaining all the rules and setting up the game takes a lot of time. Also, the iconography is not very intuitive at first so players less experienced with heavy euro games will feel overwhelmed by all the information on the board. I enjoyed Nippon very much and I would gladly play it again, but for the abovementioned reasons I don't think that it would hit the table all that often so I don't intent to buy it.

Another medium to heavy game from What's Your Game.

While the underlying game is relatively mundane, the action selection mechanic is novel and painful (Think Vanuatu for a similar game where the underlying game is pretty "normal" but the action selection mechanic "makes" the game.)

This is an excellent, thinky game where each turn is one simple action, yet the decisions surrounding that action are complex and engaging. While I like many things about the game itself, I think the board is larger than necessary, and despite its huge size, it lacks compelling table presence due to bland art. The board is a missed opportunity to bring the theme to life.

Heavyish euro worker placement depicting the industrialization of feudal Japan driven by the powerful family corporations or Zaibatsu. Build factories to produce silk, bento, paper, or optics for export or to influence local markets. Manage coal energy, tight money, and R&D for factory upgrades. Worker selection is the distinguishing feature of this game. Choose action spaces randomly seeded with colored worker meeps. The more colors you employ, the higher your labor cost. During the consolidation phases, lock in profits, earn bonuses which influence strategy and pay these labor costs. I love the fact that each Zaibatsu player can enter into the different phases at their own pace without structured turns. Much of the game setup is random. This game rewards specialization, yet to see a balanced strategy win. I don't normally go for heavy economic euros but this one speaks to me. I love the worker placement interaction combined with the timing of your consolidations.

Solid euro. There seems to be few paths to victory, and the areas are not balanced to increase fun gameplay. Not my favourite game in this genre.

Played the game, then did it again right after the first play, not because we did anything wrong per se. We were just so taken by the mechanics of it. Zhang guo was my first foray into whats your game, and I thought it a little to clunky for my tastes. This brings me back into the fold.
I picked up madiera right after my 4th play of this, and I have my eye on these designers now. This game is very solid both for me and my group!

It's all about getting your tiles to the map. Medium-weight euro game about efficiency and claiming influence on the map. How efficient can you make your moves, how can you make your factories more efficient?   

I do sort of like it, and I sort of don't.

I like the pace of the game, it's simply take 1 action, execute and move on to the next player.  I like the efficiency engine part.

I however don't feel the game has much staying power; it really comes down to "how do you get to the map as quickly as possible" game; because that's the only thing that really matters.  If you're not in the race to get to the map, you will lose.

Further, the first few moves could be argued as scripted.  But it depends on what your going for.

The trains/ships really don't do anything except modify either scoring or area control in a given region; and I wish that there was a specific train strategy, or a ship strategy.  Instead, I often feel the trains/ships only are useful to solidify my lead in an area.

Its a good game, I'm just finding it very one-way street with not much else going on.  Worth playing online to get a feel of it, but whether its worth buying/keeping I'm not sure.

Overall 6.6/10

played @ celebration of boardgames 2015.
It is a decent game, bit it did not impressed me enough to buy it.
I don't mind, if a game is not an eye-candy but I felt the looks of this game flat.
I liked the mechanics of the game, but I felt the theme poorly integrated. It's weird to say this, because usually I don't mind if a theme is disconnected.
I did like some of the mechanics in the game though, but somehow I don't feel interested in this game at all.

I didn't feel like I was producing wares of building huge factories.
Usually I don't mind if the theme is disconnected of the design is flat, but somehow both of this concerns me in this particular game.

Good area control eurogame. The unique mechanism is that when chosing an action the colour of the meeple is important and can make you choose to do a less optimal action. The gameplay is really solid with everyone enjoying it. The question however is, how much variation in strategy is there really possible?

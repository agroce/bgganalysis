Wargame? Check. 
Assymetric gameplay, with both sides uniquely different without being bogged by too many exception rules? Check. Positional Strategy that relies on Maneuverability and GO like mechanics? Check.
Card driven gameplay but with cards dealt only refining rather than defining your strategy? Check.
Playable in under 3 hours? Check. 
Concise and clear rules with a turn-by-turn playbook and only a minimal errata (which in 99% of cases does not ever turn up during play)? Check.

What more can I say?

Better than its predecessor We the People.
Fixed many defects WTP.
Asymmetrical armies/generals struggle for the political control of North America.
The british cost more to activate but the control of the seas enable them to undertake dramatic offensives in unexpected places of the territory.
A lot of posibilities and strategies for both sides.
Curiously in Our numerous plays we never saw the emergence of the French in the conflict!
EDIT: 2015.08. After several recent plays (6) I have to downgrade the initial rating.
The design of card deck allows many situations that can crippled a player: The card "Pennylvania and N jersey line Mutinies" in the english player hand in two consecutive Turns !! (The 1st and 2nd !?)
I feel the luck of the card hand can spoil a game.
Anyway a simple wargame that can be played in 1:30-2:30 hours.

C3i article written by Mark Herman was an eye opener! I liked the game before reading it, but failed to see the depth and thought that went into the design.

An excellent intro game to bring someone into the CDG genre. Expert CDG players should definitely have a copy in their collection.

RATING: 10
My favorite game, period, and I seriously doubt that will ever change.  We the People was great because it was the first strategic American Revolution game that "got it" in terms of the Americans not winning the war by winning strategic cities and it captured the politics, albeit in an abstract manner, at least it had something more than victory point cities.  And has any other game attempted to capture the Declaration of Independence and its effect on the war?  How many American Revolution games can mimic Greene's Southern Strategy of losing the battles, but winning the war?

But as good as WtP was, this game is much better.  I don't think there is a really accurate sim for this war and if there were, I don't think it would be much fun.  Washington parked outside of New York for pretty much 4 years.  That's not fun.  

No, instead, where this shines is that you [i]feel[/i] connected to Washington because you get aggravated at the unreliability of the militia (attrition rules), which We the People never looked at.  You can never get the force needed to stand toe-to-toe with the British unless you simply catch them sleeping and they make a blunder.  On the opposite side, you get frustrated with the British having to manage that 3,000 mile supply line and having generals that were too slow to act.  Sure they can win the battles, but they can't win whack-a-mole.

Also, the French Navy is better in this vs. WtP, though not dominant (as it should be).  Blocking zones, rather than a location was a big plus.  But most importantly, the French track makes the Americans [u]want[/u] to fight winnable, yet strategically unimportant battles (such as Trenton/Princeton), because it moves the track, and in this aspect, you really get the Fabian feel unlike any other game.  This is far better system to bring in the French than a single card.  And for those who complain that the French may never join, hey, I win almost all of my games as the Americans, and I only get the French about 1/3 of the time.  Maybe that's not "realistic" or abstractly captures the economic support without the military support (and think about it, outside of Yorktown, the French did not distinguish themselves on the battlefield by and large).

I also like that you can look at the "what ifs", such as "What were the effects if the Declaration of Independence were signed in 1780?"  The longer it takes, the less the impact.  

The dice vs. cards has been debated for years, as has the 50% roll for General's ratings.  That 50% captures the difference between Ft. Washington and Trenton for George Washington.  Also, it adds unpredictability, so you cannot guarantee victory with anything less than an overwhelming advantage.  The dice make this game playable by e-mail, which WtP was not, and it speeds up the game and takes the poker element out. 

Finally, the operation queue borrowed from For the People, discarding events for PC actions, and buying events add a level of depth to this that WtP simply cannot match.  I have had the Brits in WtP and had an entire hand where I could do nothing.  Well, I take that back.  I could use a 1 OP card to bring in a lone reinforcement.  But having a bunch of 1s and opponents events is no way to play a game.  The red/blue card vs. discarding an opponents event in battle (space racing it) was brilliant, because in times of desperation, do you really want to lose the initiative or win this battle?

Mark Herman took the best game on this subject and made it that much better.  It's a masterpiece.

RATING: 8.5
A very good and solid moderately complex wargame for an evening's gaming time. An average game will usually bring you at least 4-5 turns worth of manuever and skirmish before the mid game decisions set in. 

Lots of options for both players. Each army has their own strength and weaknesses that makes this game very replayable. 

Like any other card driven wargame. The draw of the card will decide who has the upper hand for that turn. Your 1 OPs will not equate to his 3 OPs. And if you fall behind with a few lower OPs cards, it could really put a stop to your strategy. 

The flip and counter flip of PCs is probably the part that I do not quite agree.

Very nice 2-player only CDG with interesting decisions and it plays very quick in about 90' as advertised! The components are of excellent quality and it has one of the most beautiful covers that I've seen in a board game as it is the actuall painting of John Trumbull for the Battle of Princeton. I recommend this to anyone that likes to have a quick and easy strategy game with historical and political flavour.

GMT 2010 Fall Sales.  

Very different CDG, doing away with the battle cards was brilliant.  We had a very tense game.  I had a great opening hand with minor campaign on 1st turn which allowed me to chase the continental congress out of Philly since I did landing party and then a full 5CU in Wilmington.  Greg make the mistake of not wintering properly but I also got carry away with chasing the congress which showed up in south carolina.  I lost 5 cu when I ended in his PC and had no way to retreat when Greene army stormed in.  Bad play since all I really need is just 1 cu force.  Greg used Washington to chased me out of NH and did some major damages to my amies.
However on last turn I ended up removing a lot of his pc via events and ended with a tie and a British victory.

    Need to play the US side next time.

RATING: 7.5
Playable pleasant looking wargame. 

The card events itselves and the event effects are somewhat disconnected to one another. In other words the historical events doesn't flavor the game and makes you feel you are not playing the American war of independence.

The gameplay is a bit pingpongy - also known as flipflopping - to me.

The game depends heavily on the cards you draw. Sometimes it limited your options in a turn considerably. I also have the feeling that the British are in favour as long as they are economical with their units.

Another great card-driven wargame. Like Hannibal it's very much about political control. This one is very quick playing, and to be honest I can't think of many games with as much excitement packed into the time. I like the asymmetric sides and there's plenty of thematic, historical flavour without any unnecessary chrome to slow proceedings down. A masterful design.

The best implementation of GO in a non-abstract war simulation. Brilliant design.

And plays faster than Twilight Struggle.

But I still prefer For the People and Paths of Glory as real wargames driven by cards. On those games, the battles and the logistics of combat get more relevance than the local politics polarization aspect that drives Washington's War much more than the combat dimension.

It seems to be pretty well balanced, but it is clearly easier to play with the americans if you're inexperienced.

A good asymetric card driven war game like Twilight Struggle and Hannibal Rome vs. Carthage.  I played as the Americans but the British looked interesting as well.

There's not a lot of chrome in the rules, or even many of the events, and I'm not certain you'd learn much about the war by playing this game, but if you already know about the war, it's about as a good a simulation as you could get from a reasonably quick and easy to learn game.  Unlike many games this deep in strategy and intensity, I feel like I could play this two or three times in an evening, due to the fast pace and and easy set-up.

The best wargame I've played.
It reminds me of Hannibal. In a good way. I also like the theme: people rise all over the country against the self-appointed royalty who thinks world is its colony. I hope this is a lesson to modern day superpowers!

I like the colony control element and the different drm's in battle. I like the artwork. Perhaps GMT's best board in a game. I even enjoyed the historical accuracy though I almost never pay any attention to it in other games.
I like the mechanics. I don't care that they are so like Hannibal. I like Hannibal. I like Washington's War.

Recommended to every wargamer.

I typically play with tournament rules. A great CDG. This one still leans a bit away from a traditional war game, but not nearly as far as Wir Sind Das Volk. There's lots of interesting asymmetry between the British and American forces, and the asymmetry informs the players' strategy. The focus of the game is both on the hand management and on clever board play. The board play takes the center stage via the political control of the colonies and on the movement of the combat units/generals. 

The events and end-game trigger allow the players to experience the Revolutionary War in view of a player-influenced, but typically ahistorical, narrative. The main source of ahistory is the order in which the events occur. Certain events coming out later or earlier cause interesting questions to arise. For example, what is the best way for the British to react if the French entered into the war by 1777 due to Benjamin Franklin becoming ambassador earlier than 1778? However, I'm unsure about two things: (1) the indefinite end-game trigger, and (2) the size of the draw deck and the resulting instability that it provides.

Edit: So the draw deck doesn't bother me too much. The British got hosed on card draw all game, but made a comeback in 1780-1781. (They were helped by a late end game trigger.) They didn't win, but it was just about 50/50 in the final round. There are ways to push through and deal with bad draws. The variable end game does add a nice amount of tension. This game is an exemplar at providing, within 2 hours, fluid and differing strategies in combination with narrative.

In my view, they've needlessly complicated a perfectly good game. "We the People" was a nice easy game to learn and a fun game to play. "Washington's War" has a needlessly complicated and long-winded rulebook which will put it beyond the reach of people who don't want to read the rules equivalent of "War and Peace" before they sit down to play a boardgame.

RATING: 7
The inability to intercept is annoying. The game feels very simple and I was dismissive of it after my first two plays, but appreciated its subtle intricacies in my third and fourth playings. So, it is one of the simplest CDGs, quite suitable as an introductory game, but also capable of being played competitively and rewarding skill.

I dislike the map tracks orientation. Text is meant to be read looking north when it should be facing south so that it is not upside down to the players who are sitting East-West.

RATING: 1
I consider it to be bad taste, at best, to have people involved with the game also involved in rating it: haven't we been down this hoary path too many times?  My request to the designer, aka, "The Oracle," has fallen upon deaf ears.  He does not want to restrict freedom of speech unless the comments are critical of his designs (just see what is said on the Consim site if you doubt).

The sycophant chorus for this game is vile.  I haven't quite seen anything like is since Warriors of God.  At what point did so many Geeks leave aside their dignity and integrity to become sycophants?  One seldom finds a serious discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of a design.  One either joins the masses or is shouted down.  In George Orwell's "1984," Winston Smith's "comrade," Syme, has a Newspeak word for such people: it is called "duckspeak."  This quacking noise is what passes for constructive criticism in regards to Washington's War.

Is anyone taking Chris Farrell's comments, and his six, seriously?  Chris can be wrong (just look at his comments on Pursuit of Glory and compare them with the actual game).  Chris has good gaming instincts, if you choose to ignore the time factor (everything is too long for him) and chrome (everything is too detailed).  Other than these, he is usually okay.  The issues Chris raises about the ratings of general are strong.  I like his Hannibal idea, something every CDG should consider having.  

Washington's War is a game that I want to like, but I have yet to warm up to it.  Here are some reasons why.

First, the talk of asymetrical warfare is an example of the emperor's new clothes: to those outside the sycophant chorus, it is just not there.  The British ability to move forces from one port to another, American controlled port, in conjunction with other armies moving by land, is dependent upon a campaign card, and those are far and few between.  Thus, the ability to practice this aspect of asymetrical warfare is dependent upon luck, not upon careful planning or strategy.  It is all neat and fun when it happens, but how often does it happen?  Thus, only sometimes do you find the emperor properly dressed.

Second, too much stress is placed upon General Washington to the degree that he becomes this "ubergeneral."  When it comes to the offensive, he is as powerful as Howe, an odd thing given that Howe bested General George in every battlefield encounter.  Washington has the special ability to lead a last card played/Winter offensive every year, another odd thing given how Trenton & Princeton (which were bloody brilliant and a turning point, no doubt)happened once, and that out of desperation.

Third, I hope my rating of one leads the sycophant chorus to up their ratings to eleven and higher.  

More to follow . . . and it would follow, but I traded away the game.  I only miss it to the degree that I wish I could point out more of its flaws.  I do have We the People, but it isn't nearly as pretty, and it is just as annoying, so why bother.

Strange game of Card Driven GO-like (yes, I mean the old Japanese game) "coloring" territories with some pointless moving armies on these territories with far worst combat system in strategy game I have played - it is simplistic and strangely abstract, but with plenty of unintuitive modificators and many separated die rolls (roll for leader bonus, roll for combat, roll for losses). 0 realism, 0 feel of war, 0 fun. Only + are very good components.

Washington's War is probably the lightest of the CDGs I've played.  While game play is quite similar to Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage in many respects, I found it to be more about political control and less about maneuvering armies around the board than H:RvC.  The rule book is conversational and considerably longer than it needs to be.

A good game that can be picked up fairly easily and played twice in an evening.

Elegant and simple.  But with absolutely all due respect to this as the UR game of CDGs, I found the core of my game worries to be the placing and removal of PCs.  Oddly, I was/am fine with this in For the People and Hannibal, perhaps because those games seem to have much more robust military and political dimensions (via event cards) and consequences. In this game, battles and events don't seem to get you much, making the PC flip-flop, dance of PC death the central thread.  When I have more reasons to play an Ops card to place and remove markers, vice moving forces, I feel I'm too far on the wrong side of "abstract."  In the same vein, I would also have to concur with some other folks' observations about generals' ratings on both sides; it seems a lot of ratings got tweaked for overall effect, vice historicity; the issue of Washington as Ubergeneral does seem to have merit, however heartening it is to make use of him as your go-to guy on the American side.  Overall, it requires too much historical squinting (to fuzz out the rankling design compromises) for me to enjoy fully.

First of what has become a legendary series of games (CDG). Arguably not the best of the series but it is what started it all. I have the original and mostly enjoyed playing it. I preordered this puppy and have great hopes for it. There are those that mourn the passing of the Battle Cards, but I am not among them. The CDG bar needs to be re-set, maybe this will...
------
Have the game in hand and it is beautiful! GMT has done a great job of re-engineering this classic, mounted map-board and all (a long awaited welcome trend). Gameplay will follow roughly the same trajectory but the new edition has sone some interesting things I can't wait to try. Rating preliminary - stay tuned...

Concerns: The strategy deck seems to have grown - one of the problems with CDGs can be too many cards. The cards are still either Event or Ops. Granted, there are now some things that can be done with "useless" event cards but I'm not sure how well this is going to work. I'm also concerned that this version is going to take longer to play - one of the earlier version's strengths was its relatively short playing time.
------
First play is mostly all good news! The card deck is not all that bad - maybe could have trimmed some of the Ops cards and included a couple more Campaign cards - only one Major Campaign card out of 110? However, if the game goes the distance, you will have seen most of them. Or you would except for the high probability of a reshuffle. I'm not sure we needed quite as many reshuffles as there can be.

The combat routines are great! Far superior to the Battle Cards (I'm hopeful something like it can be ported over to Hannibal). The game has even more asymmetric elements to it now which I think is an improvement. I still think it would have been cleaner to have combined Ops and Events but the mechanics for dispensing "useless" cards, while fiddly, become familiar quickly enough. Game length is not drastically altered, thankfully. Bottom line - Not quite Hannibal but an improvement over the original. Congratulations Mark!

In regards to the learning aspect, the clarity of the map, the small number of spaces and armies and the single usage of the cards (either OPs or event) aid new players in focusing on strategy and hand management without getting bogged down with other details. The single deck also means that deck management is not up for consideration.

As I learn more about the game and treat it less like a traditional "bash his head in" wargame, I find that the positional play rises even more to the fore in my strategic/tactical outlook. There is a distict "Go" impression that I get from it.

It strips away a lot of the clutter found in other CDGs which helps a newbie to focus on the board, their hand and the card in play. One gets a good sense of the importance of positional play (again, like Go) and also when and why to fight a inherently risky battle. 

PROS: Fun. Tense. Lots of decision points. Quick playing. Large desk size improves replay possibilities. Asymmetric sides provide interest.

CONS: A bad hand or two can be a significant setback given the brevity of the game especially for the British, but tough beans! American side could be more reactive which may take the fun away for that player, but it need not. Some folks may not like the variable game end via card play.

Wow, this game is good.  I never had the chance to play We the People, but we did have a nice hot 10 minutes with Hannibal, before Ashar (well, both of us really) decided that, while an undeniably great game, it was not for us.  Too long, too tedious, not a theme we cared so much about.  And the battle cards... made the game much longer than it should have been.  

Washington's War takes all those problems and simply ditches them.  While not a 90 minute game for us (yet), it is much shorter than Hannibal (about 2 hours) and hits all those sweet spots.  The game is very streamlined, and is all about the card play.  And the card system is the best of any of the card driven war games I've played.  The cards are amazingly versatile, and gives you just enough options.  So far, every game has felt quite unique.  Some of the early turns have a slightly scripted feel, but by the middle to end game, you will be jockeying for political control in earnest.  The linkage between military tactics and political control here is incredibly strong and compelling, and makes for some very tense, make-or-break moments.  In every game (except the first, perhaps), we've had tense finishes that went down to the wire.  This game feels right.  It is thematic in all the right ways - you feel like it models history in the making.  Perhaps this is just a user-effect, but whatever it is, give me more!

Finest strategic game covering the entire American Revolution, marrying the military and political events into entwined movements.  Don't get cocky if you think you're winning... wild swings of fortune are part of the design.  You can never call it over until it's over.

RATING: 5
Tough call. The game as a whole works better than We The People, by virtue mainly of Washington's War's newly-functional and actually quite good combat resolution system. I like the new general ratings especially, as they give the guys more nuance pretty cheaply. And the combat cards which allow you to draw a strategy card after the combat are a terrific addition to the toolset for CDG designers, adding a good deal of interest extremely cheaply.

But a lot of the appeal of We the People was its simplicity and brevity, and Washington's War is no longer quite simple. We've now got some very gritty rules for discarding enemy event cards, which I am not a fan of. And the new wintering rules seem to be problematic, in that rules have been added that actually narrow the decision space. For the most part the US player no longer cares about wintering because it's the same for them everywhere, sunny Charleston, SC or frigid middle-of-nowhere Albany, NY. Except for the exceptions for Washington and the French. There had to be a cleaner and more direct way to get the effect the game was going for.

It seems like the "ops queue" is unneeded rules grit in light of the new deck constitution, which seems to have many more ops and many more 3s.

The ability to play events as combat cards is very awkward and leads to very gamey and unintuitive tactics with respect to playing your opponent's events.

Speaking of which, the event card deck still doesn't seem right to me either. The ops cards are now there so that the British don't get screwed for simple want of cards. But the massive strategy deck (110 cards) seems to dilute the interesting events so much that you lose narrative traction. How is it that you can fight the whole Revolutionary War without ever having a Declaration of Independence?

Also unfortunately, about half the pool of Generals for both sides is still worthless and will rarely see play. It would have been better to either give them all some distinctive characteristics (as was done so brilliantly in Hannibal) to at least make them useful under some circumstances, or to just get rid of them.

It could also seriously use some sensible auto-victory conditions; it's entirely possible to play a basically lost game for another hour past any realistic point of return.

Anyway, I dunno. I was not a huge We the People fan, so maybe it was too much to expect that Washington's War would win me over. I like the new game well enough, just because the combat system is so much better, but in retrospect I think the only real chance it had to become a game that I personally would choose to play was if it had gone back to basics and re-done some core elements of the design. Specifically, if the card deck had been re-done in the Hannibal style, I think that would have opened up a lot of possibilities. The dual-use cards in Hannibal are not only somewhat more interesting strategically and tactically and better for game balance, they are also a huge accelerator in terms of theme and narrative when done well (as Hannibal did, and few follow-ons have managed). Because you see the *possibility* of so many more events in that system, you can get thematic bang even when the events aren't played, because the player has made a choice to decline them in favor of more urgent action, instead of the non-choice we have in Washington's War. Going back to single-use cards in Washington's War and Unhappy King Charles! has just felt really clunky; both games have had to add awkward rules for using unplayable events as limited ops or in other special ways, and Washington's War has further added rules for reclaiming event cards from the discard pile to get more events into play. These all seem to me to be quick-fixes which are trying to solve the same basic problems that are far more cleanly solved with dual-use cards and thinner strategy decks.

Lastly, I think another serious problem Washington's War has, from a purely game perspective, is the universally high Initiative ratings of the US generals vs. the universally low ratings on their British counterparts, which drastically limits the interest of the activation system beyond wondering how many 3s are in the British players' hand. The US will never play a 3 card for ops, while the Brits will never use a 1 card for the same. Perhaps historically accurate, but the game suffers; if the US had a 3-rated general that was plausibly useful, or if the Brits had any sort of 1-rated general, it would greatly increase the interest of the game.

Anyway, Washington's War is better than We the People and is decent, if not great, fun. But there is still a great game here waiting to be made on this topic using these ideas.

I'm kind of torn on Washington's War. It is a fantastic piece of game design for sure. But I came into the game expecting a wargame and found something closer to a euro area-control number. Control-drive card play is an interesting way to abstractly portray the political side of a conflict, and it works thematically for the American Revolution a lot better than it does in Twilight Struggle (TS makes a lot of bizarre assumptions about what each "side" was up to in the Cold War), but I really was a little surprised at how abstract it felt.  

I've had this same sort of experience with Twilight Struggle (hated) and Hannibal (better than TS, but still not a favorite of mine). CDG's have yet to really click with me. Something about the CDG mechanics feels awkward, constrained, and, ironically given the cards, very abstract.

Still, I admire the overall presentation, and, unlike TS or Hannibal, I'd definitely like to play this one again. Maybe that feeling of distanced abstraction from the history will go away once I've gotten the rules down. I'm looking to get a hold of it again.

Thrilling and accurate simulation of the military/political warfare waged between the Brits and the Patriots. The rules are not easy to assimilate due to its high level of asymmetry between the opposing forces. Need to frequently look at reference sheets for various exceptions like fortified ports and political realignments.
 
Still the game is a blast. Playing the British properly takes some doing. But once you know how to balance your hand management between political counters and military battles you can establish a formidable barrier. In addition, it takes careful advance planning in order to ensnare Washington without blowing your own overall strategic victory plan.

Top quality production by GMT. Very colourful and useful rule and play books, solid counters (each general's illustration is unique) and heavy board that will lie flat under its own weight. The card deck is huge and the card quality is very good. 

Minor gripes: The generals' stands don't fit too well and tend to fall off and there is an unfortunate but minor printing error with the 'at-a-glance' control markers. The box cover art is not as attractive as We The People's.

 For a 90-minute game the rules are long - comparable to Hannibal and Twilight Struggle. The rules concerning the use of ops/event cards to place/flip/remove PCs by the British/Americans are a headache to remember. (Major Sholto's player aid is worth it's weight in geekgold).

The quantity of cards makes thorough shuffling vital. There's not much variety in the type of cards. The choice of generals for reinforcements seems rather obvious as the poor ones have no redeeming qualities unlike in Hannibal where strategy and battle ratings are rather more mixed up and each one has a special ability. Also battles can be forgone conclusions which is pretty anticlimactic.

RATING: 4
updated 7-4-2014  When faced with the choice of playing this or 'We the People' we both chose WtP.  Why?  They're both area control games with plenty of chaos wherein a bad hand of cards can screw you; but WtP is simpler, more engaging, and manages to create a plausible narrative of the American War of Independence.  I docked this game's rating accordingly.
----------------------------------------

Yes there are changes from WtP, but not real improvements.  I suspect that given the success of Hannibal (which remains the King of CDGs), and the ways we've seen CDGs evolve since (particularly through PoG and her offspring), a return to the single deck, single use cards just doesn't play well with me.

The worst aspect of the redesign for me was the feeling that the game has become more abstract and less a simulation of historical events.

Newbies might love the game - CDG grognards, prepare to be underwhelmed.

My first CDG, and on of the first Wargames in my collection. I enjoy this game immensely. The components are excellent, the map is gorgeous, and rule-book/playbook excedes even the high expectations that GMT has established with its products. A fun two-player game that gives you a serious feel for the American War for Independence. Coming in at around an hour and a half, this is a very quick play. The games I have played have always been close. This is a game I'm always excited to get on the table.

Tidily improves on We The People without actually changing that much. At base, Washington's War is more of a win-hearts-and-minds game than a win-battles-on-the-field game; all your troop maneuvers are a means to the end of getting more of the all-important flags on the board. The specific form that the hearts-and-minds battle takes is a bit of an abstract strategy game that borrows liberally from Go, of all things. 

It plays quickly, particularly early on, but that layer of flag placement and counter-placement ends up actually being quite subtle and intriguing as the board fills up. Plus it's quite accessible -- the rules are a bit more grisly than, say, Twilight Struggle, but only a bit, and apart from a rather wristy combat resolution procedure that requires a sequence of multiple die rolls to complete, there's nothing that can't be picked up rather quickly by a motivated person, especially one who's played a CDG before.

Almost every CDG after We The People ditched the distinction between Ops cards and Event cards (including many [all?] of Mark Herman's subsequent designs) in favor of dual-use cards that give the player a choice between using it for the Ops or the event, and I am unconvinced by the argument for why this distinction survived in the re-design. Event cards can only be played for the event, discarded as a battle DRM (at the cost of reducing your hand size) or discarded on your turn to be used as a very limited 1 Ops card. To be fair, there is a somewhat interesting rule that allows you to trigger one of your events that an opponent has discarded -- somewhat reminiscent of the use of Momentum tokens in 1960 -- but it does feel like potential lost all the same. Then again, more events might not have been all that significant seeing as the great mass of the events that [i]are[/i] present are a variation on the theme of "remove/add a couple of flags somewhere."

That really strikes at the heart of why you might or might not like Washington's War. Unlike a game like Wilderness War, which really strives to make you feel like a commander maneuvering forces around a theater of war, the ways that the two layers of Washington's War (the more concrete troop-movement game and the more abstract layer of the aforementioned Go-like area control game) do and do not interact, while they are frequently interesting from a strategic perspective, [i]do[/i] have a tendency to to take you out of the moment and conflict with the game functioning as an emergent story. If you don't find the game qua game interesting, this could be a deal-breaker. It isn't for me, in the end, in part because it is a good game, but also because the details that are being abstracted away are being so abstracted in the service of keeping the game short without oversimplifying to the point that the game doesn't feel like the American Revolution at all.

Complaints aside, I think this is an excellent game, and (especially when you factor in play time as a consideration) arguably the best of the light CDGs, Twilight Struggle included.

A very fun, relatively abstract game on the American War of Independence.  The game has lots of chrome for a 90-minute game, and I am learning as I get older that I LIKE more chrome.  This game scratches just the right itch for me as a really fun game that still feels like a simulation.

Looks great!!

Learning game 2/25/12: lost as Americans. Benedict Arnold in the South gave us the momentum until his vile TREACHERY at a key battle turned everything upside down. Nooo! (4 hours with learning and lunch.) Just starting to see what's in this diabolical game.

Based on 1 play, the game is good!

I have been trying to rationalize the Go "liberty" rule which may be more good game design than good political history feel. Why does a movement need an uncommitted or neutral locale connection to survive? Some kind of suffocation of ideas as a lifeform? There may be ways to rationalize such as ebb and flow of ferment, pre or post "jumping the shark", a loose extrapolation of Frederick Jackson's idea of frontier as forming American character...?

RATING: 9
A very interesting amalgam of Go, hand management, dice rolling and area control. The mechanisms work well together and result in engaging and tense gameplay. There is a lot of depth to explore, including several strategies to pursue, and lots of tactical nuances to discover. If one goes into the game expecting a classic card-driven game one will probably get disappointed. This is a disguised abstract dressed in a fine, rich theme, masterfully using design for effect to communicate the historical setting. Battles and force stand in the periphery, they are costly and unashamedly luck-ridden, as they probably should be. The game, as Mark Herman himself eloquently explained in the related C3i article, is about controlling the colonies and the mind and hearts of the people. A well-crafted and unique hybrid that deserves attention and table time from gamers. Heartily recommended.

+ Solid and tested mechanisms, woven together masterfully
+ Theme-carrying chrome aplenty
+ Immense replayability
+ Non-fiddly, moderate components that sit well on the map
+ Well-balanced, tense and seriously engaging
+ Plays in 2 hours
+ Great art and components

= Direct and indirect conflict all the way
= Requires ability to tolerate and play both good and bad hands
= Battles are lucky affairs, only reserved for special circumstances
= Neither a thoroughbred card-driven game  nor a thoroughbred wargame

- Many exceptions in the rules, that need repeat study or an experienced player

As a fan of We the People, I looked forward to Washington's War a lot. Overall, I think all the changes are improvements. No more drawing of opponents events for a dead hand. 

But what I found was that my tastes had changed as the CDG genre advanced. Even though I love the subject matter, I found WW to be simpler than I wanted. It was less satisfying than Hannibal, and about equally simplistic. 

Its a great choice for a light, short 2p wargame...but I want more.

I have mixed feelings on this game.  Beautiful components.  A good simulation of the American Revolution.  I'm just not sure if it is fun.

It can be frustrating at times, especially for the British.  With a hand devoid of three point ops cards your three value generals just sit around doing nothing.  Historical, since Clinton did spend most of the war lounging around in New York.  But not very exiting.

There is a lot of strategy in the game.  And it's correctly all about political control rather than fighting battles.  But sometimes it feels more like playing Reversi than playing a wargame.

The rules are enough different from the standard hex game to make them not easy to pick up quickly.  But play the game and all falls into place.  Key objective for the British is to convert enough spaces to win while the Americans snipe at you constantly keeping this from happening.  The only thing that is missing for me is the great tension that I have found in Paths of Glory or Pursuit of Glory.

RATING: 8
Not a comprehensive military sim of the American Revolution, and isn‚Äôt intended to be.  It is a fun and a fast-playing impression of the conflict, emphasizing asymmetric forces and the importance of establishing political control over large areas that the armies may never touch. The isolation rules, randomization of the cards, and variable ending year add plenty of delicious chaos.  Yes there‚Äôs a Go-like aspect to placing/removing PC Markers that‚Äôs a bit gamey, but hey, it is a game!  A bigger drawback for me is the somewhat clunky combat procedure, involving several die roll modifiers and multiple rolls for a simple result.  It feels anticlimactic but maybe it should be, as AmRev battles were only occasional and rarely decisive.  Anyway, these are small complaints.

As my first Herman-style CDG it took some time to wrap my head around the rules, which are otherwise tight as a drum.  Still would make a good intro to the hobby, I think.  Also solos better than I expected, although it‚Äôs clearly not optimized for that. I do wish an annotated list of event cards was included as with the COIN games.  And maybe a variant scenario or two.  And a paper battle pad for calculating the several modifiers - I made my own.    

It is a good, rare thing to have a solid wargame that provides a full campaign play in a couple hours.  A keeper.

Probably the easiest of the CDG wargames I've played, but still a great game. Many things are abstracted, such as the British naval support, militia, and sieges. 

The cards are played slightly differently than others in the genre, as playing an opponent's event only provides one limited operations point. The event does NOT trigger and the card is discarded. BUT, your opponent now has the option of discarding an OPS card to take that event into his hand. Not all cards have an associated event, some being only 1, 2 or 3 OPS. 

There is an area control aspect to the game that should not be overlooked. Military is a means to an end, but political control of the colonies is how to win the game. I suspect that completely eliminating all of an opponent's armies is very difficult. 

There are few rules exceptions, but they are clearly marked on the map or player aid, and are even easy to remember with a familiarity with the historical period (e.g. Benedict Arnold being able to travel cross-country between Falmouth and Quebec). 

My gripes: unlike other CDGs, there is only a single use for most of the cards. No choice to use for the event or for OPs. Also, the Game End cards are a waste, being of no use to a player who holds them (other than the knowledge that they will be played). Lastly, the events are rather lackluster. Compared to other CDGs (Hannibal, For the People, Wilderness War), the events in Washington's War seem to merely add/remove control markers. I find it a bit too abstract and dull in this regard.

The additional chrome (landing parties, variable battle ratings, agility ratings, battle cards); the altered or new mechanics (varied attrition, event card discard/pickup, French alliance track, ops Q); and the new player aids (colony control schematic, number of colony spaces listed on the map), all really make WW hit a sweet spot of fast and easy gameplay, tough decision making, and solid historical feel.

Unlike WtP, the game does not devolve into a PC-placing race followed by a game of "Go." This is because the new event discard mechanic adds so many more options that just slapping down PCs no longer seems like the thing to do. This is particularly true for the Rebels, who must now respect a more powerful British naval capability, and the somewhat more mobile British armies (thanks to the Ops Q). And no more do we have the dull discarding of the opponent's events draining the fun out of a turn. 

As a wargame, WtP always seemed just a bit sterile--slightly more of a board game than a history game. The added chrome of WW (especially battle cards and landing parties) pushes WW over onto the history game side, and the game now feels much more like an Am Rev strategy game.

Got through a rushed half game.  Not really that impressed, and not a huge fan of the theme (I don't like American history), but the reviews say otherwise, so I need to try this one again before deciding to part with it or not.  Good news is that I got the extra state control markers in a C3i magazine...

RATING: 6
Tentative rating after 2 plays. The components for this game are very nice, even the box itself is extra sturdy and glossy. The player aids are handy, the map is beautiful, the counters all helpful, and the rulebook is pretty well written.

Unfortunately, the game balance appears to be off. The Americans were pretty handily defeated in our first game. The second game went better for the Americans, but they still lost, though it still would have been a decisive victory for the Brits had the turn ended sooner. It's never a good sign when, in a post analysis, your opponent tells you he isn't sure what you could have done differently after a loss.

If the Brits get lots of early ops and the Americans don't, or the Americans don't get any of the French ally cards, or if the Americans get too many British events, or the Brits get the PC prevention cards early, or the Americans don't get the Franklin card, or some combination of any of the events just described, the Americans are in trouble.

It feels like there are just too many combinations of things that can go wrong for the Americans in terms of card draw, an upshot of the 110 card mono deck, and some events that felt overpowered for the British. I don't understand why MH continues to do this. How can you reasonably expect to generate anything resembling a coherent narrative when you have a single giant deck? I understand the desire for variation, and the desire to avoid excessive scripting, but with the giant mono-deck you're going to end up with far too much variability in terms of luck of the draw influencing the overall outcome because there are a handful of events that are [i]really[/i] overpowered in relation to most of the other cards.

In terms of how the games played out in practice, it felt the exact opposite of how I expected. The Americans had to strike much more often that I would have imagined, mainly to get the French into the war sooner. Better hope you get the die rolls! The Brits, meanwhile, can play a largely defensive role and let the Americans come to them.

Based on some other comments, I can see how the British player might get hosed if the situation were reversed, i.e. the British get a series of low ops hands. So, unlike [i]Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage[/i] where you feel like your strategy actually matters, and you simply adapt based on your hand, this game feels like you're completely at the mercy of the hand you drew.

So, ultimately, I think CDG's like Hannibal, Wilderness War, and Paths of Glory are better and more enjoyable games, even if they are a bit longer.

At least it's better than [i]Unhappy King Charles[/i].

On a side note, I do like the "ops queue" concept, although it's pretty clear that it's only the British who are going to be using it. I might adopt it as a variant for [i]Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage[/i].

This game is a true classic. Easy enough to teach newcomers; yet dynamic and deep enough to keep veterans coming back for more. There are a few minor quirks I don't like (e.g., how the 'War Ends' cards are played), but they really don't detract from the experience as a whole. If you are new to war or strategy games, I would highly recommend this as your gateway game.

Preordered December 1st 2009. Received March 24, 2010.

Quite a different game from most other CDGs I've tried. More maneuvering and less fights or at least smaller fights than you're used to. Not really sure if this is a good or bad thing but certainly captures the actual war better than Washington running around with a huge army and so on.

After one play the feeling is that the luck of the draw is very important here, especially for the British. Ok, they had a harder time moving around, but some turns you can't move at all which feels a bit silly.

Still a game I'll gladly play again and once we understand the strengths and weaknesses of the different sides better the rating will probably improve to an 8, but I can't see it going higher than that.

I like what they've done with it.  A lot of issues have been cleaned up from We the People.  Better balanced now.  I really wish they had kept the combat cards.   I think that alone will keep me from buying it as I prefer the good-natured, angsty, back and forth combat.

Is it possible to play with Washington War's more balanced rules + WtP's combat cards?  I hope so.

At the beginning of the month I was trying to decide if I wanted to acquire Washington‚Äôs War or Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage next. I decided on Washington‚Äôs War, but unexpectedly received a free copy of Hannibal too, so I ended up being in the fun position of being able to play and compare them both in rapid succession. While I found Hannibal to ultimately be superior, Washington‚Äôs War is a fine game and one that I am looking forward to exploring in the future. I rate it an 8.

Washington‚Äôs War shares many mechanics with Hannibal, and the games are very clearly close relatives. In fact, it is rather interesting to see how each game takes the same basic ideas and implements them differently. How armies are organized, the limited nature of being able to switch political control, and the nature of reinforcements are all similar in general structure but different enough to have subtle yet large effects on how the game is played. For the most part I find these subtle differences to mostly be in Hannibal's favor, despite this there are a few things that I like about Washington's War that will keep it on the table.

The first of these is the shorter play time. I suspect that when all is said and done that Hannibal will frequently end up taking about twice as much time as Washington‚Äôs War. While I would rather play Hannibal than two games of Washington‚Äôs War, since game length is not that big of a deal to me, there are times when that is not going to be possible, and in those situations Washington‚Äôs War will come out on top.

I also appreciate the degree of differentiation between the American and British sides in Washington‚Äôs War. While the degree of differences between what the Americans and British could do added a bit to the amount of time it took to learn the game, its to the overall enjoyment of the game.

Additionally, I liked the overall graphic design and layout of the Washington‚Äôs War board quite a bit. A lot of the information you need to play the game is on the board, and the items that are not are easily available on the two high quality player aids. The components in general are top notch besides some misprinted markers, and even those are only something that is helpful for the game, rather than something that negatively impacts the overall game play experience.

Ultimately I found that Washington's War did not quite have the resonance of Hannibal for me. It was a fine game, but I never saw myself playing it again when I had Hannibal available.

Players are either the British or Rebels, fighting for control of the American colonies during the Revolutionary War.  Players alternate playing cards to either activate generals/troops, place political influence, or enact some event.  It's all about enforcing your political will onto the thirteen colonies, plus Canada and making sure you have more of it than your opponent when the game ends.  Remake/retweak of the more elegant We The People, a game that was part area influence, part wargame and the first of a new genre of card driven games.  It's certainly a lot more fiddly and takes a game or two to pick up the subtle stuff.  Nice cosmetic touches, such as the double size map, etc, as well as some not so nice.  Overall, nice to see it available again - probably better than We The People ... at least you'd hope so!  Needs more play but enjoying it so far.

This is probably a better tournament game than Hannibal (which has a very similar ruleset) and might be the best competitive CDG as it poses lots of difficult tactical and strategic questions each turn over a simple quick playing ruleset. However I didn't find it especially immersive, in that sense I preferred 1776 for this conflict and many other CDGs for this game type. It might grow on me with more knowledge of the card deck. I look forward to exploring its depth but as far as historical story telling it hasn't worked for me thus far.

2016-02-18 : A remark my opponent made during our play struck me : this game is indeed a bit like Go : it's all about where you put your political markers, timing and how you maneuver with your units. All in a game that can be played on a weeknight. What also hit me is that with most games I can figure out how to do well during or after the first play, but not this one - it has layers and it is deep. I want to become better at it, so I'm going to take a real good look at the map before my next play.

Good game to represent the asymmetric British vs American capabilities, but I'm confused - it is a CDG wargame?  Is it some sort of area control / Go-type game?

The loss rolls should be aligned as we became confused - do i need a high roll or a low?

RATING: 7
I suppose there's a reason why CDGs moved to dual-use cards. It thins the deck, allowing faster deck cycling, and provides players with more decision-making dilemmas. In that sense, Washington's War is a throwback to a more primitive game design. There's a sense that many of the rules are designed to overcome the problems inherent in a single-use card deck - the Ops Queue, discard event card etc. But it seems like a lot of work to get around a problem which could have been dealt with in a simpler manner, like making the cards dual-use. 1 Ops cards for the British are really, really a waste of time. 

The 1 Ops British problem is an even bigger deal considering the British have no 1 Ops commander. Can be argued that it is historical. I won't question that but there aren't that many 3 Ops cards in the deck and if the British player doesn't draw 3 Ops cards for much of his game, he's stuck with only two playable generals. 

That said, Washington's War is still a fun game in its category - a light wargame with a short playing time. It's been mentioned that the history is a bit off, but I think the balance between history and game design is relatively well-struck.

Overall, it's just not as good as Hannibal or even Wilderness War.

One of the lightest CDGs.  The good? Much faster play time with not too much lost in decision making. The bad? Only grabs the essence of the conflict without really biting down into the meat of the history. There aren't enough unique events in the deck; much of it is plain ops cards.

I'm a huge fan of WTP, but after playing WW, I don't know why I'd go back.  Personally, I prefer the new combat system.  I think Battle Cards work in Hannibal, but I feel like the small forces sizes in WTP led to anticlimactic battles that involved more shuffling than card dueling. I feel like the variable general ratings provide the same unpredictable feeling as the battle cards without lots of reshuffling.  I also like the fact that the attacker now takes casualties occasionally, instead of avoiding the Frontal Assault card like the plague.  Tying the French Alliance to military victory is a nice touch, too.

But those aren't the most interesting changes.  I love that you can discard an enemy's event to remove an enemy PC, and I like how you can trade an Ops card for a critical event your enemy just threw away (unless he threw it out in battle, in which case it cost him an impulse).  I didn't mind the "dead hand" aspect of WTP, but I feel like being able to do SOMETHING with an enemy card is nice.

The larger deck of cards means that you won't encounter every one during play, and as a result, I feel like the war's expiration date is more stable.  We only came across 3 or 4 end of war cards during play. 

The thing I like most are the new attrition rules.  The British system remains the same, but any American troops that aren't under Washington take attrition every turn, which I think reflects the history better.  It also facilitates a very different style of play for the Americans, where the British have to deal with a bunch of small armies constantly wearing them down. 

A beautiful game.

Edit: Bumped up to a 10.  I will play this game anywhere, any time.  One of the few games I'm willing to play several times in a row.  Brilliant and damn near perfect.

Fantastic production quality and provides a tense, nerve-wrecking game experience.

[5 plays]  I just can't get the time down on this one enough to justify what a grind it is.  It's really tight, and there's some interesting stuff, just not enough.  Anytime the game goes the full length it really overstays its welcome. 

[3 plays]  Really liking this one now.  A tough balance for both sides and a lot of game in a little time.

[1 play]  Washington's war has a lot going for it.  The difference in colonies makes for some interesting choices.  Both sides have to approach the game very differently.  I'm not totally sure, but I like that the Americans don't feel like a force completely on the defensive.  They are to some extent, but their much greater mobility in reinforcements, movement, and PC markers, allows them to approach battles from a more opportunistic guerrilla stance.  Like all these types of CDGs, the card deck consists of mostly ops cards and events with different names that do the same thing.  While there are some key events that really add some interesting flavor throughout the deck, I find myself wanting more in the vein of Twilight Struggle and Here I Stand.

A card driven wargame that may be single-handedly responsible for bringing me back to wargaming.  A lovely production by GMT with a heavy mounted board, thick counters and cards, and full color rules.  The rulebook is well laid out and the rules are immediately digestible for a part-time wargamer.  The game flows nicely with great tension and back and forth play.  I love the asymmetrical nature of both sides.  Very different tactics are required for both players.  I would love to see more games of this quality, game length, and rules overheard.  Marvelous!

RATING: 6
Preliminary rating: This appears to be not so much an upgrade but a tweaking of the old "We, the People" game. Basically, there seems to be three important changes: first, the battle card system has been exchanged for a dice roll plus DRM system, second, Events now have a limited OPS points ability to convert nearby enemy or neutral PC to your cause, and third, you may "buy" event cards discarded by your opponent. Apparently, the designer has decided to move away from the tension and hard choices offered by a game like Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, which is generally considered the apex of CDG (Card Driven Games) and move towards the "just read the cards" style now in vogue.

Update: I've only read the rules and played one game, so this is still a preliminary rating. The game is balanced but it seems to lack tension, among other things. It‚Äôs a solid design but it seems to have been purposefully cut down in complexity. Now the right balance of complexity in a game is hard to judge but Washington‚Äôs War seems to have gone too far over in one direction. For example: all the battlefield cards produce the exact same + 2DRM and most of the event cards have effects along the line of "place 2 PC" or "take off 2 PC," so what one player does, the other can usually undo immediately. There is a sameness in the options that is unnecessary, which produces a samenss in the play that is unnecessary. And when, in battle, the attacker accumulates a +5 DRM advantage he must win, as it depends on the roll of a 6-sided die and attackers win ties. It‚Äôs things like that. I guess what I'm saying is that whenever the designer had to decide between creating a bit of tension or simplifying the game, he went with simplifying it. It‚Äôs not a bad game, and its components are great, but it could be so much better.

A reimplementation of "We the People" with the same character, speed of play, but tweaks that more closely reflect the war.  The French Alliance follows a track,players may discard enemy events and use it to flip or gain PC (albeit the opponent may recover the recent discard for an ops), combat is via a die roll with modifiers, the British Navy is supreme as holding the coast is more of a challenge for the Americans, and 'winter attrition' affects all American CUs regardless of location, except the Continential Army (Washington and his CUs), among some other tweaks.

All in all a most excellent game, further solidifying Mark Herman's brilliant abilities in game design and is coupled with GMT's usual excellent production values,including a mounted map

Playtested it and I liked it. It is a big improvement over [i]We the People[/i]. Asymmetrical forces and realistic strategic goals make it just accurate enough. My only gripe is that for a game emphasizing politics, political influence, which was critical in determining who was in and out of command, is absent. Howe will never leave the war, and Lincoln, Lee, and Gates will never see action. Otherwise, I'd give this a 10.

We The People was an important step in wargaming history, but unlike Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, it hasn't aged well. Twenty years later, I just can't go back to this inflexible style of strategy cards after being spoiled by the multi-use cards of its successors.

RATING: 7.5
Looks like an amelioration of Hannnibal, yet it has its own peculiar asymmetric characteristics which makes it well suited to model the american revolution. 

I'm not particularly fond of the american revolution, nor of Hannibal (the game), therefore this is not a hit with me. I'm willing, nevertheless, to play again - this time with the americans - to see if the first exercise of frustration was only due to newbie inexperience.

The War of American Independence is just a terrible conflict to try and game.  There's almost no way that the British can win, and so we make arbitrary games that are vaguely ARW themed because the actual war is dull. This one suffers from basically being a convoluted Go game with battles thrown in and having the deck of cards being either OPS or Events, many of which will have no use to either player.

After one play, so rating may change.

Thanks Don for the teaching game.

I like the (usual) balance of trading off multiple "wants" and imperatives. Also, it does seem to recreate the issues faced by the sides in the conflict. Need to remember the "Go like" nature of PC survival - need liberties (sort of serendipitous coincidence of naming), and at the macro level of PC placement & removal.

I don't like the impact of the cards and that sometimes there are too few choices available. Need to play more to get a better feel for this part.

Had played We the People once or twice years ago. From what I recall, this feels different. Need to play WtP again...

Wonderful card-driven war game with asymmetric sides which nicely captures the American revolutionary war.  I especially like the Go-like mechanism of area control and the dynamics created by the winter attrition.  The rulebook is pretty large (german version has 20+ pages) but the game itself is rather simple and elegant and plays VERY smoothly.  One game should be finished in no more than 2 to at most 3 hours (with slow players).

RATING: 6
One must give credit for designing a 90 minute CDG--so kudos on that. There are two major problems, though.
First, the luck of the draw is really potentially huge. There are the War Ends events, which are essentially just forcing you to pass, and then there are all your opponent's events. Usually a CDG offers you an OPs vs. event decision to mitigate this, but that's not on offer here. Couple that with the British desperately needing 3 OPs cards, and the game can be over before it has begun.
Secondly, the rules grit is out of whack for a 90 minute game. The asymmetry, although potentially interesting, just ends up as so much obfuscation.

Played this, another great game in the family of Mark Herman games.  Not as complex rules-wise as some of its cousins like PoG, or even TS, but perhaps more complex tactically due to the lack of tactical constraints that you see in some of the other games in the family.  I really like it!

RATING: 7.5
I really like this game. It is well designed, and can easily be finished in an evening. The only drawback to this game is that I am not as engrossed in the theme as much as other games. It is in part because of the abstract game mechanics, but also due to the generic 1,2,3ops, and campaign cards. I find it ironic that given my last statement, the abstract PC marker/ Go mechanic is what adds depth to the game. I love the variable turn ending too. Don't be turned off by my rating. Anything 7 or higher is worth owning. It falls a little short on theme, but is very tense and deep game.

A strong 8 on a first solo play.  At a high level, Mark Herman has tightened up the game from We the People, making it tighter, quicker playing and more seamless.

On the other hand, the old Battle Cards were quite fun, and some of the guesswork and gamesmanship has gone out of the game, despite the better balanced play between the British and Americans (my first solo play ended in 1779, with a 7-colony tie going to the British on the tiebreak, well-established in the North and he South).

I still love the play of the older game, but everything about the new packaging and design is beautiful and well thought-out, and he same game fits in half the shelf space of the old one.  A triumph of design- certainly one of the best of 2010 for me.

Dropped to 7.75 while balancing ratings- mostly on recommendation of play, because it is a wargame and not for every moment- but it's still among the very best of wargames.

I have CDGs that I prefer a lot more.  I now find this frustrating.  Won't play it again.

Here are the WBC tournament rules:

1) The British player‚Äôs at start For the King PC bonus is increased from two PC‚Äôs to three PC‚Äôs. 
2) The colony restrictions for the ‚ÄúFor the King‚Äù PC‚Äôs are eliminated. They may now be placed in any colony. The placement restrictions of Rule 10.11.B are otherwise unchanged. (
3) Whenever the British player plays either the Declaration of Independence or the Benjamin Franklin: Minister to France Special Events, the event takes effect as it normally does. However, the British player may then draw a replacement card and immediately take another action using any card (not necessarily the replacement card). The DOI and Franklin events always occur first. 
4) In the very next turn FOLLOWING a turn in which the Continental Congress is dispersed, the British player, not the American player, decides which player goes first in that turn. In such a case the American player would NOT have an option to go first with a Campaign event.

RATING: 7
Yes, it's good and tense game, playable in less than two hours; but I miss the double role of cards being playable for events or for Ops which is in the other CDGs I've played. Twilight Struggle obviously has its own spin with mandatory play of your opponent's events, and I don't think every CDG needs to focus on hand management to that extent, but dual use cards also serve as a kind of balancing mechanism - here if you get dealt 4 enemy events, your turn's basically a write-off. For that reason, and because I find it a bit too simple and lacking in chrome, it's probably the least interesting of the CDGs I've played.

PbeM suitability: high, with few interrupts as interceptions are rarer than in most CDGs. There's a good VASSAL module.

Love the theme and the physical presentation, but the rules were a bit fiddly for me. Seemed like there were about a half dozen differences between the Americans and the British -- how their units capture, what they can do with their cards, how they handle winter, etc. -- that we kept getting wrong and having to refer back to the rulebook to clarify.

Washington's War is a very well presented game with relatively clear and straightforward rules and a moderate playing time, and yet it offers a fair amount of historical flavour - I particularly like the asymmetry between the two sides. There are a number of strategic options for both players, athough clearly the strengths and weaknesses of each side make some choices more obvious. I do, however, have concerns about the card aspect of the game. A hand with few or low-numbered OPS cards really limits the available options for both sides, and even a good hand may not present much of a choice (especially given the strategy ratings of the generals: high for the British, and low for the Americans). Furthermore, the luck of the cards determines when the game ends and plays a major role in the French Alliance Track. Washington's War is a good game but not does work as well as the best of its type: Hannibal.

I enjoy playing the British because the mechanics that govern their PC placement require that you actually develop a campaign type strategy to be able to reach the interior of the colonies and stop the colonial rebels. The Americans can potentially win the game without ever winning a battle, and that speaks volumes to me about how subtle the strategies are in this game.

RATING: 7
Light American Revolution wargame, one that adequately fills the void left by its predecessor We the People. Ditching the battle card system for a simple, one roll method of resolving battle speeds the game up noticeably. 

The rules are considerably longer than WTP due in part to the inclusion of some fussy rules for how to unclog your hand of enemy event cards. Despite what the self-backpatting party on Consimworld would have you believe, I think the rules are a bit of a disaster. Unfortunately several of the cards have glaring grammatical errors on them, too. 

Still, with the improved GMT treatment (mounted map, nicer card stock, slightly thicker counters), it's a tremendous value and is playable in around 2 hours.

RATING: 5
One play isn't enough to call it, but this seems quite unlikely to outshine We the People for me. Three strikes and you're out:

New Attrition rules for the Americans mean lots of temporary holding actions that the game negates shortly thereafter. I don't need any Agricola in my wargames, thanks. 

New dice-based combat resolution means that smaller stacks almost never want to attack bigger stacks, and seems to go a long way toward discouraging both combat and maneuvering in general. Hmmm... a wargame with rare combat and lackluster maneuvering. 

New raiding mechanic bogs the game down with mind-numbing tit-for-tat play. I don't need any 1960 in my wargames, thanks. 

It's possible this game "works" in some sense, but it's hard to see why I, personally, would invest much effort in figuring it out when We the People made a clear and positive impression on me. 

Also, 8 pages of rules in WtP and 24 in Washington's War. What the heck?

Didn't really feel like the conflict it sought to portray.

This is another very good CDG by GMT.  This game is very similar to Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage.  The game does a good job of combining area control with both use of cards, influence, and military strength.  The cards are well designed.  The components are nice quality but I have a major issue with the PC markers causing any generals and associated units from toppling over on a regular basis.  The area to track control over the 13 colonies is also poor (there is an improved overlay available in the files section).  I think I prefer this game slightly over Hannibal simply because Hannibal's generals are too restricted in where they can go and what they can do.  WW gives you free reign to make your own strategy.

Really a great game. It almost reminds me of chess. It is dense and you have a lot of different strategies from the beginning to the end of the game. It does have a luck factor regarding the cards and dice based combat system. But some how in the end it evens its self out. The card system is fun because you have to basically adapt your strategies according to the cards you have drawn. 

This games is very similar to Hannibal but the game time is shorter. I do recommend this game to anyone who loves CDG style games, especially if you like Hannibal.

Felt a bit disconnected from the subject matter, strangely more of an abstract area control game with some military grafted on.

This just showed up today, and holy cow it looks nice.  GMT's die cutting isn't as good as some others (how am I supposed to clip counters which have fuzzy tufts in the [i]middle[/i] of the edge instead of the corners!?), but the board looks great & the box could stop a bullet.

Update: misprint(?) on the colony control markers makes them nearly useless, and they cover up the colony names anyway, so I will probably use glass beads here.  Will also be looking at fan-made player aids, as the ones in the box are frustratingly limited.  Also there are a few things I had trouble with in the rules.  (e.g., campaign cards [i]are[/i] considered events for the purposes of discarding?  And the rules on discarding events to flip PCs say something like, you can do X, subject to the limitations of this other section... which says you [i]can't[/i] do X.  I [i]guess[/i] that means you can do X, but then why refer back to that other section?)

I like the sides' asymmetry, but my feeling after one learning game is that this may be the game which ends my attempts to enjoy CDGs.

Update: Major Sholto's player aids corrected at least one place where I had misunderstood the rules.

Update: I think I gave or traded this to someone.

I recently got the opportunity to play at WBC and I can say that my fears were unwarranted -- the game retains its original appeal and the developments seem to improve the original in all respects (though I still miss the battle cards a bit). I have now played the official version and can confirm that I still feel the same way and am pleased with the components as well.

You can't miss it when it is a level up of "We the People".  Coming in July 09 - delayed to Feb 2010.  Arrived 20 Apr, 2010. What a great memory of holding a game weight of mounted mapboards that can bring you back to the 80's!       

I don't have We the People and GMT appears not to be going to publish it again.  This should be the game that compensates.  Mark Herman is one of the top wargame designer that I admire.  It seems it is a more playable game than his other designs, e.g. Empire of the Sun.  Really looking forward to this. 

The game has a cool quick combat result determination process.  Both sides got to roll a die and after possible modifiers (about 6 of them), the side with a net result of equal to or greater than 1 is the winner and vice versa.  (i.e. there is no tie result which goes into another round of combat. This is somewhat different to the playtest game version whereas tie is possible and the longer the battle takes place, the more casualties inflicted on the losing side).  Combat proceudre is very much simplified.  Players can therefore concentrate on the strategy of movements and events taking place.    

The game is all about controlling the colonies via political control over the former 13 colonies in the northeastern coast of the U.S. Although the colonies can be subdued under military might, the most common way is to use the operation cards (OPS) to gain control of the majority of the cities in a colony.  At the game end (which is uncertain by the random draw of the year in one of the "Lord North's Government Falls - War Ends" cards which indicates the game should have ended in the previous or current turn), the British win if he controls 6 or more colonies (Canada, although not one of the colonies, is counted as one of the colony for victory determination).  The American wins if he controls 7 or more.  If both "achieves" its victory  (yes, because 7+6=13 and it is perfectly possible for both sides to achieve victory with 14 colonies), or none achieves a victory, the British win by default. However, this game is in very need of extra control markers from C3i, at least for the British control markers.  

Each turn a player is dealt 7 "strategy" cards.  Most of them are numeric OPS cards which are used to move the generals and their armies.  Both sides can move up to 4 spaces with each individual general taking a maximum 5 combat units ("CU") along the way (picking up and leaving CU behind is always allowed as long as the maximum 5 is not exceeded at any one time).  The American has the mobility to move 5 spaces if the armies do not execute an overrun nor ending in an enemy CU occupied spaces (cities).  

Ending in an enemy CU occupied spaces always results in a battle unless the American attempts to retreat with 1d6 less than or equal to the general's agility rating.  Interestingly, American unit can perform intercept and if unsuccessful, can still perform a retreat.  An intercepting force, if successful on an intercept roll same as the retreat mechanics, is considered to be in the space before the arrival of the British army (if the space had no British CU already in place).  Both retreat and intercept can only be conducted by the American only, making the rebellions like agile mouses all over the land. 

The British has naval supermacy and so a battle occuring in a port (unless it is located in a blockaded zone by the French if they allied with the Americans) always confer a +1 drm to the British.  The British also has regular unit advantage (also a +1 drm) until it lost a significant battle with 3CUs or more losses, or a "Surrender" happens (when there is no legal retreat route), or Von Stueben trains the rebellion into a Continental Army with an event strategy card.

Schedule for Brisitish reinforcements is fixed each turn and they are indicated in the turn track.  American use OPS to bring in the number of CUs as the OP no.  In "Winter Attrition Phase", all American Armies loose half of their CUs while only those British not in a quarter space north of the Winter Attrition Line suffers the same.  

Washington's War deepens my understanding of the American Independence War.  On the downside, somehow I am not totally satisfied with the game fully - kind of too abstract to my taste to the making and deployment of political will.  Washington's role is also downplayed and in fact, he doesn't fight.  The winter effects on both sides are huge and the forces should be returned to winter quarter every year.  Some people find the card redemption mechanism a bit confusing.  The uncertainty of the card events arriving is a good thing, though they might pose unexpected consequences a lot to the general strategy of the player undertaken.

This is a great game.  It plays quickly has a good amount of strategy to it and it is just fun to play while always feeling historical. On one recent play the Brits just barely won in 1780 and the Declaration of Independence never happened.  Out of curiosity I looked for the card and found that it was the very last card in the draw deck, some bad luck there, LOL.

Quite a good game, using the now famous Events/OPs card-driven game engine. The PC back-and-forth is a little abstract, I think. Nice leader mechanics. Battles are easy to resolve but still tense. Very different depending upon which side you play (as it should be in a game about the AWI). Took me a while to get the hang of this one: the different rules for PC placement are a tad confusing.

5 / 5 - Outstanding

Strikes a fantastic balance between deep, demanding strategy with decisions rarely, if ever, obvious and multiple factors to track through the game and enough randomness to keep things exciting and keep you on your toes tactically. The fact it's so short is a massive bonus, circumventing a lot of the issues with randomness that annoyed me in Hannibal: if you do get multiple instances of bad luck it's all over soon and you can start again! It's a fiddly game, true, oddly complex for it's quick play time, the odd run of bad luck leaves a sour taste and some of the design decisions around the event deck seem questionable but these are minor issues in a cracking design.

Tense, fun game. I really like the battle system - enough chrome to make the decisions interesting, but both simple and exciting to resolve. My only criticism at this point is that a lot of events seem generic in the sense that they all do the same sorts of things (place a couple PCs, remove a couple PCs, flip a PC, etc). I guess I've come to like the complex events of later CDGs. The fact that this plays so quickly though will keep this on table more so than those other games I imagine.

08/19/17 Played a game in 3.9 hours. 
Its a good game. As to the changes made to We the People, to me they fell into three categories. Some were beneficial (they corrected some flaw or streamlined play). Some were neutral (changes to city connections on the board, etc.) And several sure seemed to hurt the Americans. The game owner speculated the designer must have thought We the People too easy for the Americans. Maybe so. But I thought We the People quite balanced. I'd played it 12 times, and the victories had been pretty evenly split. So I took off a point from my rating of We the People (8) for this reason, and gave Washington's War a "7". 
Count me as one who misses the battle cards. Reducing them to die roll modifiers does streamline play, but at the cost of basically making Washington's War much like every other wargame.  I vote for uniqueness!

The more I play WW the more I feel its depth.  I bought this game to fill the void between Memoir '44 (lower playing time but sometimes feels too light and dicey) and Twilight Struggle (most games take us upwards of at least 3 hours).  My hope is that games would take 90 to 120 minutes and scratch the Twilight Struggle itch when there is not enough time to make it through the Cold War.

RATING: 7.5
Good game. Probably is a little quicker and a little lighter than the other CDGs. There is less to think about with the cards than in other games, and it is possible in WW to be dealt a truly dire hand (which makes it IMHO) a little more luck-based.

I have only recently received this game, and only have a couple of solitaire playings in, but I do like it for what it is -- a lighter, high level strategic look at the American Revolution. I thought I would dislike the placement of PC markers, but I think it mostly works. The 'Go' aspect gets a little weird when you have a bunch of Political Control markers surrounded and taken off the map in one fell swoop -- that's when it feels like just a game mechanic to me. But I do generally like the system of placing PC, and using that to determine which way colonies are leaning. Other than when the 'Go' tactics really show their face, it works for me as a model for asymmetrical/ guerrilla warfare. 

I was surprised to see the 23 page rulebook, but it's actually a pretty easy game to learn. The rulebook, although perhaps more lengthy than necessary, has the virtue of being extremely clear and a great reference when you need to check a rule.

There is not much historical straitjacketing in this game (both players draw from the same deck), so you won't see it necessarily model history, if that's what is most important to you. On the other hand, it's extremely re-playable. Even if it doesn't work for some as a traditional 'wargame', it seems to be a fascinating 'game'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'd be willing to play this now and then, because it's got interesting mechanics and is a change of pace game for me. Of course, it's not a topic of high interest, and I don't think I'd ever play this enough to become proficient at the strategy (it's a pretty deep game, despite the relatively simple rules.) If this were a WWII game, it might well be an 8.

For a Revolutionary War buff, this could be the definitive game, and for the only such person I know, it is in fact the definitive game. So there, I know what I'm talking about for once.

Based on four plays, and they were good ones.  Very streamlined, easier CDG with assymetric sides adds real interest.

Finally managed to win as the Americans!

Nice heavy box, solid board, sturdy cards, thick counters, laminated player aids, rule book and play book.  Most impressive.

Enjoyed my first play.  This game is tricky for sure.  I lost as the US, but would like to try again.  At least once or twice more for both sides to get the real feel for it.  It is definitely not a "battle" game.

Enjoyed after my second play and want to play again.

it is ok and might warrant some other plays, but i just find it inferior to the other cdgs that are around.  granted, none of those will likely play in the 90-120 minutes that WW will settle into, but they present a more polished and complete experience.  

Winter Attrition and the way the generals will be used feels a bit off and unnecessarily streamlined/truncated.  Compared to other CDGs, the ops deck feels bloated.  With well over half the cards ops only, it removes some of the more interesting decisions present with WWs peers.  

A good intro CDG, probably, but Hannibal is roughly as accessible and a true gem in the genre.  WW did make me revisit We the People and it had been a long-time since it had come off the shelf and I think it might be the better Revolutionary War CDG... with its different set of flaws.  

Maybe if WW did not try and chop itself into such a short time frame, I think simply an extra 30 minutes of playtime would have allowed for everything to be a bit more fluid.

RATING: 8
Not a lot of experience with the game so far, but I tentatively think it is an improvement over WtP.  I'm alright with the dice combat system due to speed of play and it seems to work well.

Rules could be improved and the index was not as helpful as it could be.  Production values are excellent and the map is a joy to play on.

I'm not so sure about the larger card deck... many of the events seem kind of samey "remove X no. of PC markers here" and so on without adding much historical feel to the game, while diluting the chance of more important thematic cards, like the Declaration of Independence from showing up.

A trimmer card deck might improve the game, I think.  Anyway, I do enjoy the game and look forward to future plays.

My first Mark Herman game that I ever owned or played. I am definitely a Herman fan now. The game is quick playing compared to others, and I enjoy the differences in strategy and capabilities for both sides.

I believe the historical importance of political control for winning the war is portrayed perfectly in this game.

Play cards to trigger events and place influence to win the American Revolutionary War.

Plays: 2.
Type: Area control game = a game where you compete for control of areas.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: 2.
Playing time: 120-180 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources - states. Conflict.
Randomness: Medium - card draw, but you control the timing of card plays.

Replayability: Low, this feels to long for what it is.
Fun: Not so much, I'm not a fan of area-control games.
Memorability: Probably pretty good at creating stories, even having counters representing the important leaders, like Washington.

Thematic integration: Decent.
Components: Good.

Who will like this: Strategy gamers that want a CDG covering the Revolutionary War.

The placement of the pc markers is a bit on the abstract side which just feels wrong for a historical simulation. The game lacks the historical depth you normally get with a lot of the CDGs as most cards have no event on them but are strictly OP point cards. Thus in the end a good chunk of the game is just playing cards for points for PC markers.

Definitely the lightest of the CDGs. Two experienced players can play this in under 90 minutes without a problem.

Sold - because unlike GMT games like Twilight Struggle (my favorite game ever) where the rules are relatively clear but more importantly you get a LOT of pieces with which to do things, very quickly... my single playthrough of Washington's War with my good friend Justin saw a whole bunch of set up, and then such limited piece placement that we immediately ruined our own positions by trying to make moves.  That negative experience was enough to make us stop playing (though if memory serves, we also ran out of time) and as such I never picked it up again.  Looks great like all GMT games do, to me - and yet it didn't quite measure up.

UPDATE: I still cannot get entirely comfortable with the amount of useless events that fill one's hand in the early game, or with the amount of fiddle with no real return on the investment. 

Still a fun game, but is it actually an improvement on WtP? Yes, you can now discard your opponent's Events for effect, but you are still stuck with Must Play events filling your hand. There are other niggles that just seem odd considering the experience of the designer and developer, so I'm not actually convinced that this was an improvement. More plays will tell.

This game is just about the perfect example as to why I just don't get into GMT's games. I respect many of their designs, but with the amount of fiddly rules here, I'd rather just play 1775 Rebellion for a similar and more streamlined experience. Also, to call this game card driven is like saying that Risk is a dice game. Only about 1/3 of the cards have meaningful events, and most of them are based around moving your troops around or fighting anyway.

Mixed feelings here
While the game is not complex, there are a lot of rules so this can't be used as a gateway wargame
The game is quite short but the asymmetry makes you have to play it many times to understand strategies for both sides

At present, probably the best asymmetric "political control and generals" CDG playable in an evening (about 2 hours).

Faster, tenser, better balanced, and more [-]interesting[/-] strategically varied than Hannibal. Perfect for the time conscious weeknight warrior.

update: I love the combat and maneuver of this game, but the single deck can have brutal implications on your luck. There is an issue of parity. The excitement that a CDG brings to the table is the challenge of playing out a bad hand. A bad hand of your opponent's events in Twilight Struggle may have implications on play later since some of those cards were culled. There is no balancing factor like this in WWr. 

update #2: I continue to want to play this, but find myself disappointed each time I do. For me, it plays faster than Hannibal and TS, but is just not as much fun.

Washington's War is a nice and easy card driven strategic level wargame. It is a simple game that uses one deck of cards. It might not be a great simulation but it feels historical. The rules for placing and isolating political control markers are a bit abstract to my taste. However, I like the way the game plays. It really is a lot of fun. Moreover, I like the short playing time. Hey, this game plays in two hours! This is the wargame you can play with your non-wargamer friends in the middle of the week. That is a huge bonus! All in all this is a good wargame that will draw new people into the hobby.

What were they thinking? This wargame has the production quality of a euro?! It probably has big cross-over appeal for those that generally stick to less conflict style games as well.

Purchased new, May 2012. The rulebook is one of the worst-organized I‚Äôve ever encountered: it reminds me of the the one for "Hannibal vs. Rome," by the same designer, who's obviously very talented. I count 77 separate references which require going to a different page, none of which has a page reference, merely the typical [number, section, subsection reference] that leaves one flipping through various of the 21 pages with such cross-references. (Unfortunately, I had to totally cut and paste and rewrite that rulebook to make sense of it, and I fear I may have to do the same for this one.) This tops the 65 such cross references I counted for "Hannibal vs. Rome." This style of rules writing, so common to war games, and what I equate to the worst kind of bureaucratic manual writing, should have gone by the wayside at least 40 years ago. The designer has written a 4-page summary of the rules that leaves one wondering why he didn't just do it in the first place. One video review here on BGG also addresses in detail the poor organization of the rulebook, so I know it's not just me. Basically, I agree with video reviewer Enrico Viglino's comment that "Washington's War" is a great 'game', but there's a larger question, namely, whether what one is looking for on the subject is a 'game' or a 'war game/simulation', as much of what happens here in controlling territory doesn't have much to do with a standard war game, and even the battle resolution procedure leaves a lot to be desired (i.e., many times one side or the other may have such an advantage prior to a die roll that the roll is moot). In these regards I come down on Viglino's point of view--that is, it's a fine design, but much less of a war game than I'd expected and personally, therefore somewhat disappointing. Add to that my displeasure with how the rule book's laid out, and that's a bit of a double whammy in my book. My initial impression of the game was a '7' rating, and I half-expected it to go up some after playing enough to really have a handle on the rules, but taking my preceding comments into account, I'm going to dock it to 6, as overall I'm a little disappointed, and am not sure I'd play it again, as the rules are so much darn work and, as many others have noted, it's more an area-control game that a war game.

There's plenty of upgrade tweaks, but the game looks, feels and plays the same as its father, We The People. The British still have overwhelming troops but it's hard to move. The Americans find it hard to keep troops on the board but easier to move. Between these two strategy bookends, the game is still an area majority battle in each of the 13 states - placing your markers down either directly through card play or by judicious use of armed forces, taking advantage of the point-to-point geography to secure off areas and to isolate and kill off opponent markers. The game can have key swings, usually more as a result of good / unfortunate hands than an unlucky combat. Like We The People, there's a touch too much chrome to make it an "easy" pick up and play if it's languished on the shelf for a bit, but there's a lot of good decision angst and it's a good length for what it offers.

I've just "sort of" started playing a game and think WW will be an excellent game.  It takes a lot more to explain the rules to someone than the 15 minutes several people have said.  First, I took 90 minutes to read through the rulebook to get a basic understanding of the game mechanics.  Then it took me over 60 minutes to explain it to someone else (an experienced wargamer, including one other CDG).  Then we took 60 minutes playing along with the Playbook scenario (which is a wonderful help), then we took about 40 minutes to play our first real turn on our own.  So to teach my opponent and then play one turn (one year) it took over 2 1/2 hours.  And that's after I spent 1 1/2 hours learning the rules on my own.  The game production is fantastic, the rulebook is very well written, with most topics indexed in the back, and it looks like a very fun and playable game.  But, it definitely takes some time to learn.  Can't wait to play it again.

An interesting positional struggle for political influence emerges from asymmetrical military operations in this well designed point to point game.

Variable game length is built into the card driven mechanic that intentionally offers alternative choices. Some effort is required to get over the learning curve since the two nations play so differently, but the game is appreciated much better with multiple plays and definitely does not disappoint. One of the best games of its type.

Great game. Would probably be a 10 for me if the deck didn't suck. Why the regression in the system? They deck only contains ops, or events. Putting both ops and events on the same card would add so much awesomeness to this good game. Also, the stupid war end cards in the deck are a dead card for the unlucky person who draws one. Why not allow the player who plays one of those the option of drawing another card to replace it??? Some minor tweaks such as that would make this game so much better...

Anyone up for retooling the deck to include ops and events on all of the cards?

Washington's war is basically a terrible version of Twilight Struggle. What I mean by that is this: the rules are more convoluted, the cards are less balanced, and the game takes forever to end, even when the player has long since lost.

Giving the English and American player different but very similar rules is probably the most annoying part of the game. That said, getting a hand full of 1 ops cards that have no card effect, while your opponent draws a hand of 3 ops cards AND combat modifiers several turns in a row is downright stupid.

Shelve this piece of shit.

A tense battle that plays in a relatively short amount of time.  Not much complexity in the rules, but a lot of subtlety in how to execute a turn.  Have yet to see a blow-out in a game, with many coming down to 1 state or so at the very end.  Tense and exciting the whole way.

A strong candidate for an introductory wargame for some folks (especially as the PC element is much more important than all out conflicts) while being a challenge for old hands at the genre as well.

I'm looking forward to another play, and to learning some techniques.

Less Good:
- bland events (add/remove PC markers).
- lack of events/ops choice, and therefore hand-management aspect less interesting (although I understand the historical justification for it).
- tracing PC to empty spaces to avoid isolation makes no thematic sense.
- for me, personally, the total lack of interest in the subject matter.

RATING: 10
So glad that GMT re-released this in 2015. A heavy euro-wargame experience that simply but effectively portrays the assymetric challenges of the powers. The US can pop up anywhere but cannot except in rare occasions challenge the Brits militarily, and struggle with desertion. THe Brits can come in guns a blazing with umpteen troops at any port, and win combats and keep their troop numbers, but struggle terribly to produce the political will (ops cards) to move the troops around.

THis is nice as you can have the historical situation where the US loses near every battle but still wins the war by winning hearts & minds.

Combat is not what wins you the game, but it is what loses you the game, which is clever. It often takes a few devastating game losses to realize how to use & not use combat. Only 90-120 min, though, so play a few times in an evening! 

Mostly OPS cards, so no real deck memorization needed a la TS. I can't stand TS, actually, this, that game's daddy, puts it to shame, I won't play TS again (course I wasn't its biggest fan to begin with...).

people complain about the cards not having dual use, but that's just them being unable to change mindsets & stuck in habit, IMO. Not all CDGs need to be identical, guys. THe game works great with the 'you can grab a discarded card and switch it with one in hand' rule...produces similar painful decisions about whether to discard an opponent card to make a play, even though the opponent could pick it up...should you save the card for combat so it can't be picked up when discarded? should you wait to discard it for an action until the end of the turn where the opponent will likely not want to trade but to do their in hand actions? fun stuff. This game does not need the dual use cards. 

Best reference sheets I've seen in a wargame--highly pictoral (2015 ed has them--they're originally c3i inserts). A Friend remarked you could almost learn the whole game from them, they were so good. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Basically it's We the People with improved detail, no battle cards, tweaks here and there and a much better board. It's a bit different. It's even better. An excellent game. You get something a little bit fiddlier than We the People for sure, but now card discards are more interesting, there's more of a distinction between the generals, the French presence is earned by the Americans and counting controlling presence is easier. Prefer this over We the People (which is also a very good game).

As with We the People, there's a fair bit of luck in the cards, but there's a good chance it'll even out and the ride is a good one regardless. Certainly the cards can deal you a bad hand, but like Twilight Struggle it's how you play the hand that'll be the challenge. My only criticism is that the cards are imbalanced, unlike something like Columbia Games' Julius Caesar where cards are more or less balanced out through action points and levies. As such you can be unlucky, but that's also ramping up the challenge, the story telling and the moments that make gaming history. It'll probably all even out in the end and the ride is an extremely good one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What a great game.  Not a simulation, but a CDG that has a little of everything.  The card management is fantastic, the theme is rich and the game play is tense.  Very well balanced so both sides feel like they are winning and losing at the same time.  The variable turn end just adds to the tension.

Just an outstanding game to play, and it plays in far less time than most wargames.  

I have found the game to be somewhat unbalanced in tournament play.  In a dozen plays, the Americans have won 10 of them and should have won the 11th with even a poor card draw on the final hand.  Other people have better success as the British, I have not seen it yet though.  Despite that I have sweated out just about every game, completely unsure how the game would ultimately end so even with the results the game is nerve racking in a good way.

This game is a redesign of the [b]We the People[/b] system and thankfully they removed the battle cards, which slowed gameplay. The American Revolution, or American War of Independence, was a very asymmetric conflict. The British start off as an unwieldy juggernaut, with strong generals and a lot of troops, but their political control markers must be adjacent to existing ones to prevent isolation. The Americans have a small but nimble force, with seven generals, all of which have low activation ratings, including two generals that are extremely good at avoiding combat, and the ability to move an extra space if they don't engage in combat. The Americans can place PC markers anywhere on the map and only have to trace to friendly or empty area.

For the British, the game is reminiscent of 'whack-a-mole', constantly putting down rebellion and converting enemy into friendly political control markers using their army. Whereas for the Americans it is guerrilla warfare; where the enemy concentrates, they disperse their forces. You only need one general with one combat unit to flip a political control marker and you can pick‚Äìup and drop-off units in a single movement.

The only chance the British have of pinning the Americans is to enter the space where Continental Congress is camped, which causes them to disperse. Once dispersed, the Americans can't place political control markers for the rest of the game turn, although they can still flip PCs if there is a friendly combat unit in that space. Then the British have a chance to make some real headway. However, once the French Alliance occurs the Americans receive the French Navy, which can blockade ports, and the French general with 5 combat units.

Played 1 game as the British. I like the assymetry in this game, but it badly needs a cheat sheet to remind players of the differences between the British and the Americans. I found the contents of the rulebook a little poorly organised, and spent the first game flipping often through the rules.

The abstract half of this game is about placing PC markers on the board, and outmanouvering your opponent into isolation. The battle half of the game is the more fun part, though both parts are heavily related. The first game took close to 3 hours. Looking forward to shortening the playing time with more plays.

[3 plays] It had been more than long enough since I had played We The People that I had entirely forgotten how to play this game correctly. It is a game which is paramount about political control with just a little bit of fighting. Spreading that control and checking the flow of the enemy's efforts is the key.

This is superior to We the People in every way, yet essentially still the same game with a better battle resolution system. GMT did a great job with the production. An A+ efforts. Get Major Sholto's player aids and you are ready to rock. I can't wait to play a bunch more of Wash War.

Update May '13: More than ever I believe this is a game of political control with only a smattering of stereotypical wargame machinations needed to win. Choose your battles wisely, almost all efforts are better spent controlling the board. 

Most recent play May '13.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Card Driven. Great game. I think we played "wrong" the first time and spent too much time fighting, especially early. I think our next play will be quite different with more focus on winning the hearts and minds of the American people.

Not sure why I traded this away. A victim of the great purge of '12.

1 play as British against my dad.  For a wargame, this didn't "feel" like wargame.  I love card-driven games like 1960, and this had the same feel.  I wasn't always sure of what I was doing, but I was coached a little and felt my way through the rest.  I was able to tell good cards and not-so-good cards on my own for the most part and would be interested in trying this again from the American side.

I like the British-American asymmetry here. Battle resolution is smooth, but emphasis is on the political end. I'm not so sure about the deck: a lot of cards are ops-only eliminating the tension of Hannibal or Twilight Struggle of choosing between events or ops, and getting rid of enemy's events via battle feels a bit odd. For the British, a lot depends on actually getting 3-ops cards and campaign cards. The variable Lord North's government falls ending condition doesn't sit right with me -- if the British have the upper hand in the war, why is the government in London about to fall anyway?

In a word, WOW.  We the People drops the combat cards (along with an hour of brainless play time), increases the asymmetry, and gets a face lift.

Washington‚Äôs War is my second venture into the CDG field after trying (and enjoying) Hannibal last month.   While both games share control markers and similar army activation, the games are more different than they are similar.   In Hannibal both sides have 2-3 armies and a couple of those are set to clash in epic game changing wars of attrition.  In Washington‚Äôs War, it is a few British armies marching around trying to squash the endless recruitment of American harassing forces, while the smaller American armies are running around flipping control markers.  This situation is created by the way that each side has different rules for recruitment and winter attrition.  
I like Hannibal more; but there is a lot to like here.  After one play I am already visualizing several emerging strategies. I can‚Äôt wait for my next play.

Very heavy (physically).  Armored box.  Beautiful.  Real mounted board.  Smooth, fun gameplay.  Good rules.  Well-balanced.  Takes the at times stuttering gameplay of WTP and polishes it nicely.  Lots of shuffling of large deck though.  I'm liking this game more every time I play it.  Some of my cards have printing smears on them and the colony control markers were misprinted making there not be enough American counters.

A fantastic card driven wargame. It combines an area control mechanic with the adddition of combat units and a fairly simple dice driven combat system.  The components are of a very high quality, especially the beautiful map.  Whilst the rulebook is a little daunting in its size it‚Äôs well written and easy to follow.  I find the gameplay is very tense with the variable game-end via the cards adding constant uncertainty.  All the games I have played have been very close run things.  A highly recommended game.

Best Revolutionary War game I've played so far.  Best thing about it is that it plays in 2 hours.  Much more of a political/area control game than a wargame.  It can take a wargamer a little time to catch on that it's not all about military movement.  

Passed up We The People a few years ago and am kinda glad I waited for this.  I like the unscripted CDG that this is much more than the scripted CDG Twilight Struggle.  I feel like I am in much more control and that I am playing the game more than the game is playing me.  Twilight Struggle follows too closely to actual events where WW sets the scene at the begining of the game and lets the players take it from there.

I really like the simple but elegant design of this game plus the fact that playing time is only a little over 2 hours. It gives the players enough tactical choices without getting bogged down in cumbersome rules. It isn't an accurate simulation of the AWI, nor is it an indepth study of guerilla warfare. It is simply one of the most playable light wargames to come out in years. But more importantly it is immensely entertaining and fun.

Hmmm...A little underwhelmed in my first few plays, though my opponent was less impressed than I was.

Pros:  Plays quickly, Continental Congress creates nice focal point for campaigning, good asymmetry between the sides

Cons:  Event cards have a lot of sameness to them ("remove 2 opposing PCs from X location"), the special event cards create dead weight losses for the person who draws them which seems like a feature that could have been easily rectified, is Delaware really worth the same amount as Pennsylvania?

Big Sticking Point:  There are an awful lot of turns where the British can't really move.  2 "1" cards, 1 "2", American combat event, American event, British event, War Ends isn't a particularly fun hand to play.  I'm a bit worried that this game really needs consistent draws out of the deck to be fun (not even balanced, just FUN...it's not much fun to have a turn that consists of placing reinforcements, placing 5 PCs, and moving once).

Nearly the perfect game - easy to learn, accessible, quick playing, looks great, and tightly balanced.

But the thing that keeps it from being perfect is that I've experienced, seen, and heard about 'Hands from Hell' in too many sessions. In effect, the card draws (from a very large card deck) are too chaotic on occasion and can spoil the game.

Still, Washington's War is a masterstroke of design and playability.

I thoroughly enjoy Washington's War because it's a wargame with an extra twist.  The political aspect of the game is what really makes it golden.  The players not only have to deal with making sure their armies are decent (which is hard enough to do in this game) but also that they're swinging the colonies in their political favor.  A tense, fast-playing, and replayable game.

I'm on the fence about this one. You've got a pretty... peculiar... political control system (Go, anyone?) with a pretty interesting situation. The front-loaded Brits must crush the Americans immediately, whereas they just want to move around to fight another day. 

Note: Now off the fence. I don't like it. I see what it's doing and it's a lot better simulation than, say, 1776, but it still doesn't match the history. I think only a game where the British can "lose by winning" seems to work for the historical situation.

RATING: 9
Excellent card-driven game set during the American War of Independence. The game is basically a re-implementation of 'We the People' and it feels dated in some ways i.e. cards can only be used for one purpose, such as operation points or events, which is unlike other games that have taken the system and developed upon it providing the player with multiple choices per card. There is however a brilliant simplicity to the way the game plays as each side fights to gain political control over the majority of states, and the use of the point-to-point map works really well. This isn't a game that's centred solely on combat either as players can place political influence in areas without resorting to battle. It's an asymmetrical game with the British possessing greater military strength and being more immune to the effects of wintering, whilst the American colonists are more maneuverable and have a greater number of generals. Despite this it's a game that is almost perfectly balanced and is hugely enjoyable to play as a result.

Not a bad game, system is like Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage in that it uses Political control as some area control mechanic, while using generals for the wargaming aspect.

To gripes with the game: first, for me, the theme is less appealing as the antique Roman-Carthage struggle or f.e. the Cold War struggle in Twilight Struggle (which is not a wargame, but also uses cards to drive the area control, and a game I would consider when playing a meatier game with 2 persons). Bear in mind though I'm European so American History is probably a bit further removed from my interest as the typical American gamer. 

However, the greatest dichotomy in this game is combat. Count your forces, add your general and some modifiers and just roll a die. That's it. A simple die roll to determine the fate of a complete army. While it certainly helps to speed up the game, I strongly feel it is at odds with the rest of the game, which is much more about decision making. Also, I would not care if a die roll is used for some generic troops battles, like Nexus Ops, Risk etc. But not if you are scheming to get a particular general to do some particular thing and in the end it is 'who rolls highest' that determines success. This is what brought down the game from 'good' to merely 'ok'.

Given that I already own the (imho) superior Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage I won't be playing this game much, but won't mind if the friend who owns the game brings it to the table to get it played.

Comparisons to Twilight Struggle are inevitable. The games are obviously derived from the same basic structure.

Whereas Twilight Struggle draws a lot of tension from the card play, Washington's War is really about the balance between military operations and political control. Tension was high, and the game came down to the wire. In that sense, I really enjoyed my initial play of the game. Washington's War also covers an era of history that I'm interested in, and so the thematic, historical events described on the cards were a big source of enjoyment.

My criticism is of the battle system. It takes three die rolls from each player to complete a battle. The first roll is a 50/50, but the result can be devastating if it doesn't go your way. The second is a typical higher is better modifier. And the final roll is for damage after the winner has been determined. My problem is the first roll: it seems arbitrary and impossible to plan around. That arbitrariness left a bad taste in my mouth. On the other hand, the fact that it is possible to win a battle and still lose troops was very historical. A number of times I was able to lose a battle as the Americans, but still hurt the British -- which is of course how the Americans ultimately won the war.

Overall, the game is good, but loaded down with too many rules for more than occasional play. Twilight Struggle, although less interesting to me thematically, is a better game of a (very) similar ilk.

How cool is this game? Well I never played We The People even though I wanted to so I can't compare it to that. I've played some other CDG's though and it's awesome in comparison to those. Interestingly as the game was being taught and I was told that there are OPS cards and then there are event cards I thought it would be a step backwards design wise. Most CDGs I've played have both and you have to choose how to play them. Oh no this is such a cool idea. Really makes you think about how to play your hand step by step, card by card. You do not have the flexibility to just ignore an event and play it for the OPS. No sir that event card IS and event card, play or discard and run the risk of your opponent picking it up for a low OPS card himself. 

Awwwww man this game is just fricking cool.

A meaty game contained within a simple set of rules.  Many choices and tough decisions for both sides each turn through wonderfully simple mechanics. Game system rewards a good plan and execution of it.  Replay value is very high and unpredictable due to the cards device.

Have played Twilight Struggle & Hannibal before.

Found WW very hard to teach. The asymetrical nature of the game was cool, but in practice we could not keep track of who could do what. 

IE: "You can use any ops card to retrive a discard...whoops, sorry, the American player can only use a 2 or 3 ops card." 

Keeping track of how to place PC, how to flip PC, when PC gets isolated and when PC impacts game mechanics felt tricky and non-intuitive. 

Will try again and see if I can figure it out.

Washington‚Äôs War is not just a re-tread of my earlier design on the same subject, but a true re-design that is keeping the basic feel while simplifying and speeding up what was already a fast paced game. Washington‚Äôs War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that enables a player to play a discarded event for the cost of an operations card. Now unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers to push your strategy forward. Washington‚Äôs War is being broadly tested on the internet to give players a voice and a source of input prior to publication. What was old is new again‚Ä¶. Be the man on the white horse and forge a nation or save an empire.

The asymmetry of how each side functions is clever, but are the Americans fun to play? Do we play wargames to confront our opponents or plop political control markers around them? There are many improvements here over We the People, but the changes to American Winter Attrition and Combat makes the game a tremendous step backward and considerably less fun. The best American strategies will rely heavily on card draws and are incredibly dull.

This gets points for its quick play (a favorite for my short Sunday night sessions), its fantastic artwork, theme and exciting game play.  My only criticism is that it sometimes feels a little abstract (what with the Go-like placement of control markers), and not as "military" as I would like.  That's not the game's fault.  It does what it does so well.  Maybe I need to try 1776 for that sort of experience.  But the experience of Washington's War is a fine one.

Edit 11-7-17: Such a good game. The flavor of the cards really enhances the game play and teaches you about the war. The game play has been tuned up from the big play imbalance that existed in its first iteration (We the People).

2 things keeping it from being a 10 for me is that players can still get card dead much worse than say FtP (where each card has ops value) if they draw a bunch of war ends/opposing player event cards. sure you can discard for 1 PC action but if you have drawn great cards of the opposing side then you are giving him/her a big opening to exchange with ops from their own hand and then play them against you. only way to stop that is to play it as a battle card but then you are shortchanging yourself on impulses and may leave your opponent with 1 or 2 or more free plays at end of game turn where you can do nothing.

the other thing is the end condition. while i like the variable ending so you can't plan out exactly when you need to win, i much prefer Mark H's SW such as in FTP rather than having the war end with Lord North government falling without regard to how the war effort is going on either side. 

minor quibbles all in all, the game is great and can be played in a few hours tops, sometimes as little as 90 min. but you still get a lot of game in that time.

Rating after one play.  Hey, whaddaya know, a CDG that really DOES live up to its billing as fast.  There's a significant amount of rules overhead, but since I was coming to this after already having played [gameid=234], I was familiar with many of the basic concepts.  Still took us a while to get through the rules, but the game itself was quick.  I'm excited to try this some more, because this may be the rarest breed of wargames, the one that plays in less than three hours that is still very satisfying.

I am quite unsatisfied with the changes of We the People. 
The game is much more luck-dependent now, especially due to the - simple and very basic - dice-rolling for the general's battle rating and for the battle results. 
I prefer the battle system and the battle cards in We the People a lot. 

With bad card draw and especially with bad dice rolls the British player has no chance to win against an experienced American player. 
The American player can win even with bad card hands. 

Until 2010-05-18: 8 plays (3x American side, 5x British side)
Results: 5x the American player won, 3x the British player won

This is the second card-driven game that I ended up liking. Compared to TS, WW is much faster and more dynamic. The rules include really annoying details, but since they are never against the common sense, you will get them by the second or the third game. This is the lighter version of TS--shorter play time, a bit more luck-dependent, and more dynamic board situations.

Wow, first off the production on this is just spectacular. I think its the most beautiful looking game I own.

This fixes one of the main problems for me with WtP and H:RvC. The lack of battles. It's no longer just a war of positioning and Attrition. The 50/50 chance of a leader not fighting to his fullest (and lets be honest, everyone has a bad day) leaves the door open for more attacks/battles.

In record time, the new 2 player Eden War Room favorite.

Captures the essence of the war very well; easy rules, challenging.

Most excellent.

- gotta love the North cabinet falls end of war cards - a far superior mechanic to the roll a 6 dice roll mechanic some other CDGs use.

So many clever improvements on earlier CDGs, including the variable general ratings and the unforeseeable 'End War' mechanism. Simple games, very deep strategy. Deeply enjoyable - it certainly helps that it covers one of my favourite historical periods.

RATING: 7
I'll never enjoy card-driven wargames as much as block games due to my personal preference for down & dirty combat (plus "bluffability") over chit-based area control.  But Washington's War is short, fun, and one of the best examples of its type.

[i]Update:[/i]

Sold! If I ever want to play again, everyone I know owns a copy.

I'll never get the urge, anyway.  Too many other interesting games to try and enjoy: No Retreat!, Guelphs & Ghibellines, the [i]Storm Over...[/i] series, my Nap 20 treasures, EastFront & Hellenes and other unplayed block games, etc.

I'm no longer interested in playing games that aren't my style.  I'm not getting any younger, man.

RATING: 5
It's OK.  There are significant problems with the game, problems I believe mostly caused by the insistence by the designer to force a 90 minute playtime.  The CDG deck is too large.  Mandatory plays add randomness and swing and provide no benefit in return.  There is little reason for either side to engage in military conflict.  Ahistorically, the British do not suffer attrition in the Southern States.  The 'general' roll adds chance and fiddliness with no perceivable benefit.  Etc, etc.  Would I play it again?  Probably, but for the investment of another 30 minutes, I could fit in 'Hammer of the Scots' or 'Twilight Struggle'.

RATING: 8
This is a brisk playing strategic look at the American Revolution.  The asymmetric forces and asymmetric problems each faced are modeled well.  It doesn't have as much chrome as Hannibal: Rome v. Carthage even though it uses the same engine.  The payoff is that the game is quicker and cleaner (once you understand a couple of its unique systems).  I probably still prefer Hannibal if I have the time, but I'll take Washington's War if I don't.  It's an excellent high-level look at the war.

There is a nice rules re-write in the files section that's worth reading and you should definitely use Major Sholto's player aid, also in the files section (and I think printed formally in an issue of C3i).

This is almost Twilight Struggle with combat. It had a few more layers to it that were semi-fiddly but made sense as the game closed. I'd like to take at least another look at it now that I grasp what's going on. I definitely would have done a few things differently understanding all the rules now.

RATING: 9
Very abstract, very tense, great balance, fast-paced and lots of fun.  May contain wargame-like substances.  That describes WaWa.  This is not a classic wargame, but honestly, who cares because it is just so much fun.  The seeds of the CDG genre, sown by Mark Herman with this game's progenitor, are bearing fruit and this game is a great example.  It's easy to see why CDGs took hold when you play this game.  Mark Herman is a brilliant designer, and this title does not disappoint.  There are just so many paths to victory, and so many things that you need to do, both in defense and offense, and such limited means to do them that the resulting tension is really fantastic and really makes the game very interesting.  You must also develop early game and late game strategies, which are distinct from one another, but then variable game end also creates even more uncertainty and tension.  Just riveting.  Can be played multiple times in one sitting, which is another thing that is uncommon with CDGs.

A wargame with a Go-like surround-and-capture mechanic? Crazy! I had a really good time with this one, although the Americans just got stomped. The two sides are clearly meant to be played very differently, and the British are a lot more straightforward. I'd like to play again, but as the Americans next time, since I feel like, in crushing them, I got a better idea of what they should have been doing.

The only downsides I see to this game are that the rules are awfully intimidating relative to the actual amount of complexity, and that I think the Americans will be very hard to play for most beginners, even if the two sides are balanced in experienced hands.

Enjoyed my first play of this quite a bit, though something feels a bit off with the end of war cards.  Through no fault of your own, you are forced to play these with no benefit beyond controlling the end of the game, but even that is a moot point if you only draw one a turn.  Then you just have a dead card in hand.

I dunno, I have to think about it some more.  Again, this is after only one play so my opinion may change with more games under my belt.  Time will tell.  But the fact I'm thinking about it this much and actually writing about it is a good sign. :)

While I love Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage, this game left me underwhelmed. Although the cards seemed very similar, this game felt constrained and was not as tense.  Fewer battles and less exciting event cards and PC turf battles.  While the designer simplified combat a lot, rolling the dice was not as tense and interesting as the old battle card approach.  It just seemed weird that Rhode Island and Delaware were worth as much as New York, PA, or Virginia although they had many fewer spaces for political counters.

RATING: 9
Another highly enjoyable card driven wargame. Dice play far too large a role in combat for my taste. Otherwise solid gameplay mechanics. Procedure for discarding enemy's Event cards is better than in Twilight Struggle or Labyrinth, but Washington's War is thematically somewhat dry compared to those games. Still, much is saved by the historical significance of the events the game recreates.

Great game, lot's of strategic decisions conflict.  I changed this from a 9 to 10 when I discovered there were 5 people who had ranked this game below a 8.  Everyone has a right to their opinion but I don't think the game deserves a low rating with no comment as to why, so I am being opinionated back!

A bit sorry that my bad experience and personal taste makes me rate it so low (although, one vote will not matter). 
Found that the game is not really a wargame and not really a CDG, as one would expect. There is little actual war going on (at least for the Brits, whose generals are very expensive to activate) and the main goal is to place PC markers and try to isolate opponents territories. 
As for the CDG part - the mandatory events and limited use of opponents events can render ones turn almost non existent). 
For me this is just a map with counters, dice roll and throwing some pictures around. Not playing it ever again.

I like the CDW aspect of this game. Our first play was over very early (I believe the earliest turn it could be over) - I don't think we fully understood the goals and priorities until very late.

I was a bit disappointed with how little combat actually occurs - it's more focused on the political control markers and manipulating them. Combat is more an object to manipulate those markers than anything else. It's also difficult to isolate PC markers. I expect that isolation will come more into play in a longer game.

7/19/17 -- Rating 8:  Definitely an improvement over the original game, although at the cost of some added, fiddly complexity.  I think that, what with it's overhaul from We the People, there was a missed opportunity to modernize the CDG mechanisms to take advantage of some of the strides taken in CDG design.  In spite of that, it's still my favorite of the card-driven games, mainly for the subject-matter and the Go-with-armies style of play.

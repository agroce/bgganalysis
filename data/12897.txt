GAME: La Bataille de Ligny
RANK: 3579
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rules are a revision of the award winning system developed by Marshal Enterprises and cover the full range of features that were characteristic of the Napoleonic battlefield. The game is therefore designed with serious gamers in mind. - 
Its a real tactical fight of Napoleonic Warfare!!

Check http://www.tactiquesnapoleon.com for "Tactique Napol√©on" as a Spanish variant to these rules, by bringing together the best of both!

The rating is for the game series' system only; haven't played this one yet.

This isn't a wargame, more like figurine game without figurine. No command rules, lots of calculation for minor details and impossible french in unclear rules

As part of the 100 Days, a must.

Visited Ligny as part of the Zucker tour in May 2012.

There is a fairly comprehensive museum based in one of the strongpoints of the battle. Checked out the main bridges which featured and also checked out the field where Blucher was unhorsed and ridden over.

There also was a Waterloo prototype that was played that was linked to Ligny,Quatre Bras and Warve. Anything with the British was popular. Tactics continued to evolve and the game system incorporated these changes.

I wanted to have a look at the 'La Bataille' system so picked this up. The level of detail looks great but I think it has convinced me that I will stick to the 'Jour de Gloire' games which look much easier to get to the table. 

Anyway purpose served so I'm happy to sell/trade this.

Lots of needless complexity in this system, joined with great maps and counters, makes it hard to judge. But over time I have come to really despise this system as one that is lost in detail at the cost of playing. Too bad, as I have spent lots of money on the games in this system.

Nice developing battle around the hamlets around Ligny village. Great maps & counters, as always. I often wonder who still plays these old style games. I used to love to, but who has the time?

The French will get bogged down and slog it out around the St Amand area. If the French can break through the Prussian center to the windmill, the battle is lost for the Prussians.

Good: Napoleonic - Tactical - Medium / Difficult

Great game, bought it in order to combine it with La Bataille de Mont St. Jean. It is as large as the battle of Mont St- Jean and when I play this scale, I prefer to play the latter. Nevertheless a very interesting tactical situation and worth as a stand alone game.

RATING: 8
La Bataille Series. Recreated the romance of Tactical level Napoleonic Battles, Infantry with Column, Line, Skirmish, Square, Cavalry using charge or pursuit, Artillery fires. Each unit got their own morale rating. The best use of combined-arms-tactic in battlefield the higer chance to force enemy rout off from the battlefield. With the 4th edition cole rule added the command system and random activation, push it to a higher level of a masterwork wargame. I will give La Bataille Series Games a Rating of 8.

La Bataille de Ligny is a four 32"x22" maps game re-created the fight on June 16, 1815 around Ligny village.

Prussian with 2corps set-up on the map, another corps will enter the map as reinforcement. French with Imperial Guard Corp, 2 Infantry Corps, and 3 Cavalry Corps and a reinforcment under-strengh Corp. The battlefield around Ligny have plentiful terrain good for Prussian set-piece-defend, moreover the defend ground of prussian with tons of cultivate ground that blocked the LoS for Cavalry Charge, force French but only can frontal assault. Bloody Battle, both side got about equal chance to win the game, however if you play the french side and commited the Imperial Guards at the start of battle, I sure you will win this game, however, How to fight in the coming day vs British??

I still remember the day when I saw this game , coupled with Quatre Bras, unfolded on the billiard table at my friend Fabio's home: a great emotion! 
I've played it together with Quatre Bras at the italian convention of Montegrotto terme: the very top moment of my career as a wargamer.

I have Quatre Bras, so I thought I should complete the 16th of June 1815 in my La Bataille collection.  I decided against La Bataille de Dresde (Clash of Arms) and La Bataille de Aspern-Essling (Marshall Enterprises) on the grounds that they are too big and too terrain affected.

Ligny seems reasonably open - a chance to really get the essentials of Napoleonic warfare into play.

Really enjoy La Bataille. Beautiful games, great fun to play. The rules have come a long way. Still not easy games to play well, very intricate, especially the cavalry rules. If you don't mind the work, a truly rewarding game experience.

Ligny is great with 4 players. Maps are fantastic to look at, love all the leaders and combat/morale system.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Good monster games evoke something special in me. Fear, eager anticipation and a longing to see what will unfold. This game very much falls into that category when it is set up. 
Ligny makes for an engrossing tense game that will really challenge both players tenacity. The ability to wring everything out of every piece of cardboard will be telling. It is a game where both sides have the ability to act decisively.

At 4 maps, it is not for the faint of heart. However the package includes numerous smaller scenarios that focus on parts of the battle that make it far more manageable.

Currently playing this with the Marie Louise rules set, which have been a real asset for the La Bataille series as a whole.

La Bataille series finally get around to the Waterloo campaign. Ligny covers the fight with the Prussians, and the botched pursuit toward Wavre. Late series graphics produce very nice maps that look almost hand drawn, along with the colorful countermix that we've come to expect from this series. Further refinement of the series rules removes even more ambiguities.

RATING: 6
One of my favorites in the system. The French are in a little better position than the Prussians, but the Prussians can make them pay for every inch of ground. This game is best played in the context of the 4 game quad of the 1815 campaign since it gives both players a need to husband their reserves.

La batalla de Ligny. La batataille. Colosal es una palabra peque√±a para calificar lo que se mueve a lo largo de los cientos, miles de hex√°gonos que abarca. Con √©l te mover√°s al nivel de lo m√°s grande que ofrece el hobby.

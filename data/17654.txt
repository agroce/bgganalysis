RATING: 7
Some odd rules and trains, would like to try again sometime.

Second play, works much better with variants to swap the 10's and E trains, switch the first two privates and make all the $50 ones available. Still needs something to beef up the ferries which are pretty much useless for the amount of possiblity and map space they inhabit.

One playing with 4.  18xx:  Great-Lakes setting, 1826 style (less the 5/10 share companies).  Heavier on stock and train shenanigans and lighter on route building/running than I'd prefer.  Like 1826 towards the long end of the spectrum.

Another decent 18xx "kit" game. This one is longer and adds some new elements for the die hard XXer. A lot of privates (some of which do not appear in every game) will tend to make each session very different from the last. The different way loans are handled and the different way the merger corporation is formed will give 1856 fans a fresh look at some of the finer points of that game. 

Might be a critical flaw in the train roster where one level of train is actually worse than the level before it. I've considered various house rules, but generally reach for a different title instead.

Furthermore, my group can see no way for the merger corporation NOT to form. We wanted an optional borg but in this case it's gonna come.

Wow!  This is a solid second tier learning game for the 18xx series and is another title I am surprised to have not heard more about in the community.

Interesting mechanism for nationalization (Straight from 1826, I understand) but feels unpolished, overall (ferry is quite useless and draws a lot of attention for itself, for instance)

Not sure I like the consolidation railway that hits mid-game.  Seems to add an element of randomness to it.  This is a fairly long game to have that strike.  Maybe another play would increase the rating.

The 'E' trains are just... bad.  A few minors skew the game considerably.  Enjoyed at first, but after 5-6 plays, I have lost interest in this title.

Interesting privates and majors with a harsh (hex) train rush and some pretty interesting nationalization rules.  I really like it after one play and am mroe than happy to play again.

Good 18xx.  The lakes make the play more confined, with many chokepoints, and the capitalization rules, and plethora of privates, make stock decisions more difficult.

Edit: not-so-impressed with the number of 'special' tiles in this game, nor the almost invariable tile shortage of one particular tile: these both lead to somewhat formulaic track placement in some parts of the map.

A great medium length 18XX game overflowing with options. Beautiful components. Deepthoughtgames.com finishing is definately top notch. A beauty to look at. This is how handmade games should look.

I think I like this a bit more than 1856.  Maybe it is because I like the location!

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

18GL is a lesser known variation on 1826 (France) which itself isn't among the most popular 18xx variants. McGuffins are the hex locomotives, the private companies that feature unique capabilities but cannot be bought by the railroads, loans for the companies and a merger that will gather up all railroads without a locomotive at the time it can happen.
The focus is on track building, juggling assets between the companies and cleverly using the merger to dispose of liabilities. Already from the start companies can gain major income with their runs. A few rough edges exist that clearly show it as a fan effort such as the first company having such a strong capability that it probably will be bought by the first player directly or the ferries that add complexity without major effect.
I like it better than 1826 for doing away with the minor-major upgrade, the more interesting map and lack of a dominant railroad as the Belgian is.

RATING: 8
Not completely convinced about game balance (the eastern part of the board is really strong), and absolutely needs a variant for the initial auction. Many of the private companies don't feel like they're worth even their face value, and the $20 company that can just be bought without any bidding is way too good. The 18EU auction has worked well for us.

But it's good, brutal fun, especially the formation of the government and the token density that sometimes feels completely insane.

I don't expect to see this for at least another couple years. Either he's stopped producing games or hasn't updated his queue. Or both.

Modified game from 1826.  I would like to try it again with the variants recommended by the Chicago group and posted on Lou Jerkich's Game Corner.  I believe the game has serious problems without these fixes.

RATING: 5
(After 1 play) - so far my least liked 18xx of any I've tried. Although I was initially excited to try a game that contains so many variants on the standard play system, none of which on their own is all that complicated - in actual play I found it to frequently be a confusing mess trying to remember what differed from standard 18xx play and in what ways. Our PBEM game didn't even finish - most if not all of the players seemed to lose interest in it.

I'm not an 18xx regular and I only played this one once, so take these comments with a huge grain of salt.  I found the map really fun with the weird Chicago situation, the mountains and the ferries.  The private companies had some interesting powers, but many seemed to not come into play in time to be useful.  The big merger that happens midgame ended up being a deciding factor and it left a sour taste in everyone's mouth because it seemed impossible to prepare for (I ended up coming out ahead because of it through no grand strategy of my own), but maybe familiarity with the game would make the timing and ramifications easier to predict.  Definitely on the heavy side.  Very nice components.

overall a good member of 18xx, i think some changes are necessary:  get rid of the diesels(put in 5D's or 8's or something), get rid of the 1830 archaic auction and then you have a very solid game -- on the plus side the hex trains seemed to work in this one

Have played this three times now, twice on two players and once on three.  Very good heavier 18xx-game, need to time the trains so the right companies end up with 10Hs, Es and Ds (as one is not necessarily better than the other).  Quite fierce train rush can lead to several companies being forced to fold into the Contrail... again, proper timing is needed to keep one's companies out.  Endgame felt much less convoluted and less tediously drawn out than 1856 (in which there always seemed to be minor +10 upgrades to do).  A strong 9, might be a 10, more plays needed...

The longest 18xx game I have played in.  Took us three sessions (of maybe 2-3 hours each) to complete.  Probably has a lot to due with the number of companies involved.  The variations of being able to only build one track per turn; having the train runs limited to the number of hexes rather than cities; as well as certain tiles can never be upgraded took some adjusting to.  Overall I really liked 18GL because of the many options it gives to the players.  Even the privates seem more useful rather than tacked on just as a source of revenue in a lot of the other versions.

I do have one concern though.  With only one canal/lake route available.  It means that several companies will be limited in what runs they could do.  Which can either be interesting or frustrating.  The ConRail is a novel concept, reminds me a little bit of the Russian Rail from 1861 and could be manipulated to screw the others depending on the state of their train owerships.

All in all a very solid 18xx game that probably won't get played as much due to its length.

Alright game, but didn't do much for us.  Mechanics are straightforward and not terribly fiddly, but the actual scoring (while clever) tended to blow a player out and the range of abilities just wasn't that exciting for such an abstract game.

RATING: 4
A decidedly under-cooked design.  Lagoon has double-sided tiles in three colours (different colours front and back) and chits in the same three colours.  Whichever colour has a simple majority of face-up tiles when the draw bag is exhausted determines what scores.  Only chits in the majority colour score, only unravelled tiles (tiles discarded after they have been placed) of the other two colours score for their unravellers.  It seems to me that at any player count there is little alternative but to pick a colour and go all out for a majority in it.  Try something more subtle and balanced and you will lose to the competent player who goes all out.    

The special powers on the tiles might have provided some ways for alternative strategies to thrive, but for the most part they are either feeble or highly situational.     The better ones are not difficult to spot; you'll camp on them and use them repeatedly.  Combine the blandness of the powers with the severe strategic limitations and you have a pretty dull game.

The artwork is generally good, although the Cosmic Kinoko does look disturbingly like a lemon jelly.  Production quality is very good.  The rules suffer from a touch too much of both repetition and  thematic blather.

At first glance this games seems quite simple. You are moving your pawns across tiles trying to collect seeds in order to collect points at the end of the game. Also you draw tiles from a bag in order to expand and explore (the bag that comes with this game for drawing the tiles is a joke. If the tiles were Carcassonne size it might work but since the tiles are the size of Keyflower tiles & twice as thick it makes it impossible to shuffles the tiles about in the bag once you put them in)thus giving you and your opponents access to other abilities. However this isn't as easy as it seems. Pawns (called acolytes and Eldrids) can activate other tiles through other pawns as well as having abilities triggered during certain phases of the age,. In the end you are trying to unravel (remove) tiles from play in order to score them at the end of the game. But you score depending on how many of any one type of tile is the most numerous after it's all over. So you have to plan very very VERY carefully. This one brought out our AP more so that even Trajan (and that's saying something). So for real gamers the theme and components may be off putting but this is a very strategic game.

Waited awhile on getting this game, to the point that I'm not sure it's even being supported anymore, but was rather impressed by how the shifting of the tiles and exploration and maintaining the 'balance' of the energy types really conveys the fantasy druid theme very well. It's elegant enough once you've learned it, but really seems to play best with 2 or maybe 3. Artwork is great, lot of potential, I hope it hasn't just been abandoned but that seems likely.

Truth be told, I need to play this game to fully evaluate how I feel... but that's largely because of how unique this game is. On one hand, you have this strong abstraction. But on the other hand, you have a game that is nearly an area-control game. Overall, it provides lots of decisions to make.

Even without the Kickstarter wooden-disks, the component quality is amazing. Everything.... material, art work, iconography, durability... very impressed. 

I honestly think this game could go higher with additional plays.

Fun little game. We played 3 player. Final scores 11-4-3. This is basically an abstract strategy game. The powers of the tiles themselves seemed fairly simplistic and not of much use. There was a real fight to get the "main" color done (turned out to be blue). I will try the 2 player game next as I feel it will offer more control. Also, the solitaire game looks to be fun.

 I was initially under impressed with this game, but the more I played it, the more I enjoyed it.  I agree with the general complaint of the game, that most of the tiles just move around your pawns.  After playing it a few more times, however, I started to enjoy it for what I believe it is, relaxing game that is beautiful, easy to set up, and not very heavy.  Now, I quite enjoy the game, and I'm happy to have it in my collection. Also, it does not feel like anything else in my collection, which gives it a great value.  I personally do not think it compares with anything I've had ever played, and I have played a lot of games.  I think the game is uniqueness should be noted and appreciated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice game with a unique mechanic I have not experienced in any other game. An offshoot of area control, but the act of "scoring" removes it from the board, and the final state of the board defines what is worth points and what isn't. Easy to teach and easy to play. There is a good amount of small text on the individual tiles however, which can lead to some analysis paralysis and would be a burden if small text is difficult for you.

RATING: N/A
2014, 1-4p, 60 min.  Mostly abstract.  Collect seed tokens and landscape tiles (each in one of 3 colors), hoping that you can make the right color tile dominant on the board so you maximize your score.  Doesn't balance well as 3p because someone gets left behind (cannot keep up when 2 people are bashing the color landscape he is working toward).  Lots of thinking and trying to optimize your finite number of moves each turn, and making matters worse, you only get to reactivate 3 druids per turn but you might have 4 or 5 druids (another decision point and game staller).  The board and abilities are constantly changing as new tile abilities are uncovered and as players unravel (destroy/remove) tiles from the board.  Based on the end game scoring, it's almost an "all or nothing" situation where you get very few points for picking the wrong colors to collect or destroy.  The theme is weird and doesn't match the gameplay.  You cannot make any future plans because everything can change about the board/abilities between your turns as players add and destroy tiles; the 4p partnership game is maybe better but you still cannot really plan your turn before your turn starts (and all you can do is sit quietly until it's your turn again).  Yuck.  Also, the game reaches a certain point where a particular color (of the 3 colors) has a solid majority and there's nothing you can do about it (i.e., if you invested your efforts in the other colors you're gonna lose horribly).  Double yuck.  The 2p game is a little better because stuff isn't getting blown up as much or at least you can predict/see it coming.  Overall, it's a frustrating and rage-inducing game that may never get played again.

Solid game. Fun mechanics. Some really cool combos can be lined up. Shifting territories. Killer art.

Highly recommended.

*Not higher, due to solo rules setup language being overly confusing.
There must be a few easier ways to convey how to setup the game versus what's in the book.

Other than that tiny caveat, this game is AWESOME!

Kickstarter edition w/wooden pieces. Really great. I have the 3 promo tiles, the only promo item I'm missing is the Bear faction but since I don't think those came in wood, not really interested.

Rating reflects solitaire play. It's an interesting puzzle. I've played on neophyte and acolyte or whatever the two lowest difficulty are called. the lowest was an easy win but the acolyte level was a bit of a challenge. I enjoyed it but I fear it might not be a great game to play with another human - too much AP.

I have a 2nd, non-kickstarter copy with no promos as well.

I love this game, although it's complicated enough that I don't get to play it as much as I'd like. The artwork and components are luxurious (especially with the wooden seed tokens, but the hex tiles are satisfyingly heavy and solid too). The theme for each colour of magic is a nice touch (yellow recharges druids, red moves druids, blue moves tiles), and it's fun to try and figure out complex combo moves with your limited active druids, as well as the moment to possibly ditch your first preference and start chasing another colour.

I really like this game. The endgame scoring is innovative and the tile-laying and tile-removal aspects make this a really special game! There is a lot to think about each turn and it is important to plan 2-3 rounds in advance and carefully prepare your moves!
The only thing that makes this game a little dragging is the sheer amount of different actions and combinations of druids to activate that are available each turn. You will need some time to figure out your best move each turn, which also aligns with your overall strategy!

RATING: 7
A very interesting game. One of the better ones to come out recently. However, only partially to my taste. It has the delicate battle for control of one of three colors that king of Siam has, but that color is strengthened by the increased control in it, not decreased. This is because tiles of the other colors that are unravelled give you control of the third color. I imagine that experienced players will walk that line very carefully together. The part that is less appealing to me is the combo mechanism. It works remarkably well. Perhaps I would enjoy it more if the information of what the tiles do was more concisely articulated. Perhaps through som iconography?

Played KS P&P. Really interesting puzzle with lots of interlocking mechanics. It's a good application of game theory, using the idea of rock paper scissors competitive strategies. That leads to some interesting game states as the colour you are supporting needs to not eat all of it's natural victims, otherwise your natural predators can grow unchecked.

It surprises me that this isn't more popular. It's got elements of magic the gathering, elements of spatial games like hive, beautiful artwork, and some interesting mechanics. I'm still learning some of its nuances but the tiles having individual powers and the players trying to "unravel" the board to suit their goal really gives the game a feeling of strategic depth. It also passes one of my new wishlist criteria: It sets up quickly and can be explained (somewhat) quickly.

I have mixed feelings about this game. It seems like they should have streamlined the rules and made the theme less involved; there is a lot of jargon relating to the theme in the rulebooks. The art is amazing,as well as the quality of storage and components, but this really feels like this should only be a side game to this game's world. Alas, the "main" game will never be released, there has not been a peep from three hares games since 2014, sadly I assume the kickstarter and subsequent sale didn't pay for the production costs. Here's hoping he didn't have to sell his house.

Beautiful artwork with a lot of strategic depth.  3 player games unfortunately often degenerate into 2 vs 1 so this is best played 2 players or 4 player (which is just done as 2 teams of 2 players against each other) but even then you can get a run away winner.  Game is great when both sides are balanced and in the thick of it but needs polishing to make that happen more consistently.

Appeals to me as a magic the gathering player. It is hard to describe what the game is as it's a bit of a hybrid. 
The game does suffer from analysis paralysis if not played often, and is a bit of a brain burner. The main complaint comes from the way the board changes from turn to turn, all your plans can be ruined before your turn comes around... for that reason you have to adapt.  But by that puzzle solving nature I recommend the game with its solitaire variant.

Pretty art.  Seems to have good replay-ability, though I'm a little confused every time I play it regarding what is and is not a legal move. They made things difficult by half-inventing a language and using words from this "language" for several terms.  For example, there's three core colors that effect scoring - red, blue, and yellow, and they could have easily just called them "red, blue, and yellow", but instead they made up strange words and refer to the different colors as those words nearly everywhere in the directions.  This was completely unneccesary.  They just tried too hard to make the game thematic.

The description says its best with 2.  I say its worst with 2. (though I've never tried solo rules)

The ebb and flow of the rock-paper-scissors system used here is really smart. The natural building up and tearing down of player abilities prevents the game from getting too combinatorially overwhelming.

There is possibly too much advantage to going last, but the end is triggered, so play is structured around the fact.

There may not be much variety to play as most of the game is in deciding which of the three energies to support and then becoming too entrenched in the unwoven tiles to possibly switch focus. Perhaps this perception came about due to overzealous unraveling on my part.

Multiplayer is predictably not as good as two-player.

First Impressions: 6

I don't usually comment on components, but they are quite a waste here. The game is barely playable with four players-- really only intended for two-- and yet includes components enough for nine (!) players. I would have rather seen another five tiles than so many druid circles.

Lagoon: Land of Druids is a very unique experience.  The art and components are gorgeous.  The mechanics of the game are fairly simple (easy to teach) yet mastering this game is definitely a challenge.  As each game progresses everything becomes more intense and your strategy has to switch constantly.  Which of the three energies (Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin) will dominate?  Better figure out quickly because each game can turn at the flip of a switch.  This game has a lot more depth than you would expect and contains significant replayability.

Lovely spatial action point game based on rock-scissors-stone.  Can be very swingy, but is interesting trying to put together moves to unravel the right hexes.  Nice art, lovely components.  Hopefully future expansions will use all the otherwise superfluous bits.

The interesting part in this game is the way you can build/destroy the board to change which colors produce VP. I'm not a huge fan of special power games, and this one has a lot of that going on that would benefit from some symbols so that players can avoid rereading all the tiles. I would like to play the partnership game, rating still could fluctuate up or down a point.

All in all, a decent game with an interesting modular board. Easy to teach and get right into playing with a short play time.

Extremely abstract. First half of the game is just tile-placement. As soon as one player unravels their second site, the strategy begins. Considering a house rule that fixes this.

RATING: 5
Beautiful art. So beautiful. So, so, so beautiful...

I wanted to love this, and found that, while some turns were interesting puzzles, the tile effects were less varied than they seemed. Many of them boil down to "get a piece anywhere I want". Many of them boil down to "refresh X pieces". The nuances of board position made some turns different from each other, but not the tiles (or not much). 

I think if the stock-trading score mechanism had been something better this would probably be a solid point higher and have more chance of ever getting played again. As it is...

The art, presentation, and quality of components of this game are top notch.  The theme, however, doesn't really tie in very well with the game mechanics.  

If you like abstract games there is a lot to enjoy here.  Tile abilities are well balanced and the 'psychic bond' between pawns that allows use of other tiles is a really nice touch.

I almost backed this on Kickstarter. I am now happy I didn't and just acquired it through a trade. It was mostly boring. Very few of the available actions were a better option than exploring and unraveling as often as possible. With a game like this one, I want to be agonizing over the available actions, not trying to figure out how to spend my action allowance simply because I have it. Meh.

Underestimated game. Very unique. I still need to play it more, but my only complain is that it seems that the last player have to much power, and might till the balance of energies at the end. Muy bueno!! Ideal para dos jugadores. Uno va construyendo el tablero mientras hace mover sus druidas activando habilidades en los territorios. No es un juego para jugadores principiantes, es un juego denso que te hace pensar mucho para descifrar la estrategia ideal. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There's some cool stuff in here, but the game does one thing that I typically really dislike in games: wall o' text! The entire board becomes a few paragraphs-worth of text that you have to internalize, and in the case of my awful memory, that means I get to re-read a book every turn. If you have a general plan you don't have to read every tile, but it's enough to become a bit tiresome. Some symbols on the cards would have been very welcome. Perhaps just a symbol showing that a particular power lets you move the tile you're on would let me know at a glance if I needed to bother reading that tile for its details.

I'd play again, but I don't think it's ever going to excite. Might go up a point with familiarity.

And I can't imagine playing with 4. The chaos! The downtime!

RATING: 8.4
Wonderful designed abstract game. Seems best at 2. I like the solo play but ai may easily be beaten. I must try harder variants.

Gameplay evolves with every turn. It is a well designed game and a definitely hard one. Shouldnt be played with gamers who has high ap rate.

After few plays my rating grew quickly. This is definitely one of the best 2 players game i have ever played. Some tile powers seems useless for the first or second games but once you discover the tactical nature of the game, tile powers have become meaningful and well designed. There are not super powerful game changer tile powers like ameritrash style but all of tile offers brilliant choices for a suitable situation and need careful planning. It is hive-like strategy game after all. I have played a few game and none of them likes another.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (March 2017)

I wasn’t expecting much from Lagoon: Land of Druids. I bought the game some time ago and I bought it at full price, since then, I have seen it severely discounted in many stores, but after playing it, I can say it is much better than expected, but still not for me.

The rules are pretty easy to learn and teach. You can explain the game under 10 minutes. Playtime is under 60 minutes.

Theme is ok, but pasted on. It is mostly an abstract endeavor.

The game´s components are ok but the art is amazing! It looks great on the table.

Gameplay seemed fascinating at first, it seemed like you had many options and the best play wasn’t obvious (I love this in games) but that wasn’t the case. Each tile has text on it and you could potentially plan the best strategy, however, the power level of the tiles varies a lot. Most tiles are very situational while other are very good, so there is a lot of uncontrollable luck here. To summarize this point, it is luck if you draw the best tiles and most tiles aren’t very useful for most the game. That’s a shame as the whole game is composed of tiles. I love how the druids work but that isn’t enough.

Another issue with the game, to score points you have to have tokens of the dominant energy and tiles of the other two energies. From the beginning of the game, there will be a color that has less tiles that the others so you need to make sure to remove (unravel) some of its tiles and that’s the dominant strategy, that is, you need to pick a color and unravel it as much as you can, that will score you a lot of points without caring which of the other two colors ends up as the dominant one. With this strategy, the text on most of the tiles won’t be much of a consideration. The initial unbalance can be leveraged to your advantage. Due to this, I didn’t have much fun playing the game, it makes no sense to unravel tiles in any other color as that color could end up as the dominant one, thus scoring you zero points. At the beginning of the game I was excited, but at the end I never read the text of the tiles, I unraveled as much as I could and that was it. This also have the effect that you know who is going to win well before the game ends.

I didn’t have much fun playing the game :/, it was unexciting and gameplay becomes boring and repetitive soon.

Best with 2 players, but the 4 player partnership is also interesting.

Bottom line, Lagoon: Land of Druids has some very interesting ideas, but they seem underdeveloped and that’s a shame. As the game progresses, the text on most tiles becomes meaningless. It was better than expected though, but I already sold my copy of the game. I would play again if requested to see if my appreciations are correct.

Played Oct 2014

The fight to control which element is dominant, and hence endgame scoring, is very interesting. With 4p you are in two teams of two which I liked a lot. The key seems to be leveraging the special powers of various locations to accomplish goals on your turn. Without their help you usually need a two-turn plan to unravel a location. In this way the game feels a bit like a puzzle as you try to imagine all the possible combinations available to you. There is some luck in the tile draw which I think hurts the game a bit for me, but overall it was enjoyable.

RATING: 6
It's not a terrible game and actually had some interesting moments and decisions but I have no desire to play it again.  I didn't mind the rock / paper / scissors mechanic as much as I thought I would but what I did mind was the downtime.  You have to wait on every other players turn while they read a half dozen tiles on the board and decide how they want to play their turn, then they almost always draw a new tile, read both sides to determine what side they want to put in play, then everyone else has to read it to see how it will effect their decisions on their turns.  Snoozefest for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It has very cool mechanics of exploring and unraveling, and the emergent "destiny" which totally affects the scoring is novel and innovative.  

But unfortunately, after two 2-player games, we are disappointed that the powers on the tiles are all too low-power, mundane, and similar to each other; they generally just move tiles or druids.  I think this could be an awesome game system if all the tile powers were rethought and cranked up to become game-changing, as for example in Innovation.

p.s. The art is beautiful, and this was a very classily-run kickstarter.

Gyönyörű illusztrációk, átlagon felüli kivitelezés, nagyon vastag kartonelemek, a KS kiadásban ráadásul a játékos tokenek, illetve a "magok" fakorongok, de közben benne vannak a kartontokenek is.

Szerintem kimondottan egyedi a koncepció, három szín egyensúlyáról szól a játék, de előbb-utóbb valamelyik irányába elbillen a mérleg, ami a játék végi pontozást határozza meg. Maga a játékmenet viszonylag egyszerű, viszont minden lapkán jelentősnek mondható szövegmennyiség olvasható, ezek értelmezésre szorulnak, jelentősen befolyásolják a válaszható akciókat.
Az 1-4 játékosszámot szerintem hiba volt ráírni. Tipikusan 2 fős játéknak mondanám, 3 főnék akaratlanul is kedvezünk valamelyik ellenfelünknek, miközben a másikat meg "ok nélkül" károsítjuk meg, 4 főnél pedig párban vagyunk egymás ellen, tehát igazából mégiscsak kétfős. :D A szólószabály pedig önmagában plusz 3 oldal a szabálykönyvben, ebből sejthető, hogy igazából eléggé másképpen működik, mintha rendesen játszanánk.

Ha van egy kis rutin, meg már találkozunk a lapkákkal legalább 1-2x, gördülékeny a játékmenet, és bár nem látom át, de úgy érzem, komoly mélységei lehetnek. Talán valamennyire a mélyére ásunk majd idővel. :)

* After first play:

- I like how the 3 colors each have powers that have a common mechanical theme. This makes it easier to see through the large number of powers (1 per tile side = 54!).

- I like vying for the dominance of *one* color that is accessible to *all* players: this can give rise to *fights* whose goal is to impose a dominant color, or to *races* where the final dominant color is mostly established and people are trying to be the best at it.

- I like not knowing what the opponent's strategy is: it is nice to try to decipher it.

- Turns are long, but can be used for thinking, at least with two players (unlike those games where you have to wait and see what dice you will get, or games where the situation changes too much between turns).

- Turns are very quiet: there is enough freedom to scheme.

- The mechanics prevent too many options to be available on a given turn, in a way: not too many druids that are refreshed (usually 3), and usually each of them can take only *one* action, and mostly *only from the tile that they are on*, which limits the possible outcomes. However, there ample is room for scheming plays that use multiple activations of the same druid (generally over a few turns, sometimes in a single turn). The point-giving Unraveling limits the size of the Lagoon in a way that reduces the choices in a useful way (prevents them from being overwhelming).

- The rules are quite natural and simple.

- I don't understand why we have so many druid schools (?), since at most 4 players can play the game. This looks like waste too me. I would have preferred maybe some special powers for each school.

- It is nice to be able to regulate the length of the game at the start (through choosing fewer or more tiles).

- That said, despite all the 54 special powers, the game does not have the thematic/situational richness/thickness of, say, Magic: the Gathering, or Diskwars, where "dramas" of a very strong flavor happen more often, where new, very qualitatively different situation are likely to happen each game, even compared to a game like Race for the Galaxy, where different tableaux can have distinctively different flavors (especially with the expansions)—even though Race rarely has drama, as it is more like a race, without much gap between players, often.

- The art is definitely nice. The tiles and text are big. No problem.

* After second play

- I could really feel that I was getting more comfortable already with the game: it is nice to be able to strategize more and concentrate less on getting familiar with the game. The turns were clearly faster. Still full of "I'm doing this… uh… no… this…; moving there… uh… no… there".

- The dynamics of the colors was nice: having a single Haven, far from the tiles I wanted to Unravel, for most of the game changed things, as did not having any Red, which was Unraveled very quickly.

- The permanent effects are nice: they give bonuses, it's always nice to get something. It's also nice that their effect repeats: I got to know them better than the other tiles: Mani Temple, Awakening Portal.

* After not playing for a long time

- Going back into the game was quite easy. I had forgotten how many refreshes we get each turn (3), and I had to mostly check the rest just to make sure that my memory was not faulty (like what to do with the druids on unraveled sites).

So many strategic decisions to be made... and the board state can change so drastically between turns, leading to having to re-think plans... but that also leads to long turns as you re-strategize.  But a solid game for those mentally nimble enough to tackle it!

This game seems to seriously suffer if one player does not take an active role in destroying hexes and shaping the "destiny" of the board.  Our game came down to basically a coin toss of what tile came out last with one of us holding 10 yellow tiles and the other holding 4 blue and a red.

It can be difficult/impossible to plan your turn in advance because the board can be too dynamic.

This has an interesting rock-paper-scissors dynamic, but if one player doesn't pull his/her weight in the game, it becomes strange lopsided and can come down to a coin toss between the other players.

The core of the game is interesting to me, but all those special powers on every side of every tile break the experience for me. I don't want to have to read 10 paragraphs of special powers every turn. I wish the game systems were emphasized more over the special powers, then it might be a good game. As is it, I can not see myself picking this over other 2-4 player games.

A game that's all sizzle and no steak. It's a beautiful game, and provides a serene experience as you play, but ultimately it leaves me feeling very unsatisfied. Most of the time you're running out of useful actions to do, and it's pretty sad when both of my games so far have ended in a tie. This game is just wholly uninspired, and it shows. This is a prime example of a Kickstarter game where you can't judge it by its cover...and not in a good way.

Interesting mechanisms and awesome production values.  I would agree with the other comment that the game should only be played with three as the two player game has a runaway leader problem (I honestly have no idea short of lucky tile draws how the losing player can possible catch up).  This also means that the four player game would suffer from the same problem.

Initial rating after a few 2 player games.

I've never played a game quite like this before, so it's hard to put my head around it. Since the game state is always changing, it's important to be fluid in your game play. I love games in which you can outsmart your opponent with combos that they didn't see coming.

I'm sure that the more I play this game the more I'll enjoy it. Being unfamiliar with a site(s) abilities frustrates me because I know I'm not playing in an optimal way. But I'm sure it will be gratifying once I get more familiar with Lagoon.

Component quality is some of the best I've ever seen in a game. Based on my experience with prior Kickstarter projects - I did not expect the game to be as polished as it is. Two thumbs up for David Chott.

Edit - After further plays I am getting the feeling that many tile abilities are very circumstantial - which ultimately makes me feel there are too many 'dead tiles' on a given turn. Hence, making combos impossible.

Beautiful art and original mechanics compliment each other well in this game!  Me and my friends finally got to play it, and, while it can be difficult for four people to play because reading the directions on the cards is difficult unless everyone is on the same side of the playing area, we were drawn in by the drama of choosing a destiny for Lagoon, and the convoluted strategies that each team had to employ to try and win were fun to come up with.  Can't wait to play again!

RATING: 5.5
This game reminded me a lot of Shadows over the Empire. The mechanics are very different, but the feelings are quite similar. You have to be constantly checking the powers of the tiles, searching for combos. As in Shadows, the idea is very neat, but then the gameplay doesn't follow, because the result is not a game as open to different strategies as it seems and because the time between turns increases quite a bit (you can try to plan ahead, but the tile layout will likely change before it's your time to play, that means you'll have to think again during your turn and everybody will have to wait).

Indeed, in my only game, as soon as a kind of tile had some "advantage" over the others, everybody assumed it was going to win, and it was a race to win points specific for this kind of tiles. Of course, since everybody behaved this way, a few turns later it was evident that kind of tile would win.

The game did not feature deep tactics. We just placed our tiles where we needed them to be to destroy that kind of tiles, and explored to find tiles to be destroyed, and some tile position change to try to make things more difficult to the other side, but that din't work well, because we just had to undo what they did, using the very same tiles and resources.

I guess the ideal tactic would have been the opposite, to seek the tiles needed to destroy the tiles we were using to destroy the others, so that we couldn't use them anymore.

In any case, the game seems pretty much straightfoward, and there was no tension, no nothing. Also, the end felt unsinspired. I had to be absent during the last couple of turns, but it simply didn't convince us.

Otherwise, the art is very good and the tiles are thick. The remaining components are very nice too.

This is an oddly convoluted tile-placement and area-control game. Although I can't say I dislike the game, it does suffer from obtuse and unnecessary terminology, high potential for a runaway leader, and altogether unexciting gameplay.

Alright, I'll update this again after a few plays. Here are my thoughts. Beautiful artwork, fantastic quality pieces and very easy and clear to understand rules. The gameplay is solid, although I think a 3 player game can drag a bit. I feel like until I've played this a few times, the goals and usage of the tiles is not very straightforward. This can be a good thing, but we'll see if that continues to happen as we play.

My rating still has the potential to go up a point. Doubt it will reach 9 or 10, but it's a really solid game.

This game had a great implementation of theme that made it feel like everything I did mattered in the world of the game. The rules were fairly simple for the main part of the game but the powers that each land has added complexity and diversity. I was almost sure our game would run long, but in the end it was even less than an hour play through for 3 fresh players. Lagoon is def a game I will pick up when I get the chance to.

This game is kind of interesting. The idea is you get these little workers who walk around this hex board exploring areas, destroying areas and collecting tokens. There are three icons in the game, and at the end, whichever icon has the most presence left on the hex board determines what tokens and destroyed tiles are worth points. We played 3 player, and it felt like the player in first had a hard time, because he had two other players gunning his progress down. I will say that in 4 player mode, the game uses two teams, so I think perhaps 3p not an awesome player count for this game. The tiles had some interesting effects and combos. I'd play it again, but it didn't blow me out of the water.

Just got around to playing the P&P game - it's brilliant.

What I love is how the energy strategy you choose changes as you play. I was blue, blue, blue for most of the game, then the balance of power changed, so I went for red, then I considered yellow when Jasmine seemed to have flip-flopped too, then I went back to blue for the victory!

It came right down to the wire.

Fantastic game, really look forward to playing more.

simple. clever. contained. easy to teach. the tokens are sensible if not better than most meeple-based worker placement games. My only criticisms are that some players can get stuck in an AP loop and that I find the rule book difficult to reference during setup. (Something about the page layout makes it hard to identify how many druids you start with and I never remember that)

I had the chance to play Lagoon at Unpub 4 and I was incredibly impressed.  The game is simple mechanically, but has great depth once the tiles begin to reveal and the shared tableau takes shape.

This is a heavy thinking game for new players at least.  I find it really difficult to wrap my head around this one.   Is it a strategy game or a tactical game?   It's definitely a puzzle-y game on your turn as you are trying to optimize what you are doing.  It's a little lower rating for me as it has wild swings for a game with a high thought investment which actually takes a little fun away for me.  Maybe it just too difficult for me.  I think it has almost a stock market aspect as you are almost trying to invest in shares and properties based on how the final outcome of the world is.  Very unique game that I can see many liking a lot but for me it was a little bit like work rather than fun.  I might dabble with this one more as a solo.

RATING: 8
I've still only played this 4 times since it arrived in November 2014 (I backed it on Kickstarter). It's very hard for me to get to the table as it only pays 2 or 3, and my wife, and most others I game with regularly, have declared themselves unimpressed by it. Clearly BGG as a whole is too, judging from the game's ranking.

Yet, based on my limited plays, I think Lagoon is a really interesting and fun game (it's unquestionably unique), which while seeming a bit chaotic in the first few plays, I can see being a real game of skill. Using site powers and positioning one's druids correctly (as well as when and what to explore) will take several plays (at least) to master, and the whole rock-paper-scissors dynamic among the three energies in the game can lead to lots of really interesting situations. I'd love to play this one again, ideally several times, but I can see that it's unlikely to happen very often. (I did get in a 3p game just the other night, but I know they'll be rare, and 2p games even rarer.) Perhaps I should give the solo game a go? (It's unlikely, I don't enjoy any solo boardgames, and I recall the solo rules here being rather complicated.)

This game is an appreciable gem that never truly gained enough steam to warrant the expansion. It uses the tile laying mechanism with a twist, allowing you to manipulate the game state through tile capture and movement.

(+) The game retains straightforward gameplay but allows for plenty of deep tactical decisions and some limited player interaction. The complexity lies in the tile abilities and combinations.
(+) Unique rock-paper-scissors type scoring system in which certain colors dominate others and your final score will depend on the end-game state and tiles you captured.
(+) Beautiful artwork on tiles.

(-) Messy rulebook and unnecessarily obtuse game terimnology.
(-) Luck of the draw with the tiles can be hit or miss, but tiles are double sided to increase your options.
(-) Easily induces AP, more so to first-time players. As the game progresses, the accumulation of tiles can simultaneously expand and muddle the decisions to be made on your turn. Play can slog forward at times.

This is a good game that could have been amazing with a better development process.

It's an interesting mash up of weird powers and weird scoring rules.  The remote activation of times using a different druid really makes the game.  My biggest complaint is that too many powers are complex but nearly useless, so the board gets clutter with a lot of irrelevant text and it becomes an exercise in reading comprehension more than strategy.

Weaknesses
With more players there is probably some real downtime and the game state can change a lot before it gets back to your turn limiting strategic plays. Note this is not an issue with just 2p.

Note: My impressions are primarily for the solo game.

Having played this 10+ times now with the solo game, and have beaten it on its hardest difficulty, I think I have a good handle on what I think about this game.

Lagoon is effectively a stock-holding game where the winner is typically the person that backed the winning stock/color when the game ends.  Because of how scoring works, this person can often win by a very large margin, and the winner/loser can constantly flip back and forth from turn to turn.  As a result, the game really feels like it just boils down to being in the lead at the exact moment that the game ends, as opposed to steadily building up a lead over the course of the game.  Add on top of that the randomness of tile draws (and the randomness of the AI in the solo game), and it's all a bit too chaotic/swingy for my tastes.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Typical Kickstarter: there's some good ideas in here, but it lacks the polish to provide a balanced, compelling gaming experience. The removal of tiles as an objective is a pretty novel concept, and I like how they added a rock-paper-scissors type of scoring, where depending upon which faction has the most removed tiles decides how the scoring is performed. However, the scoring is also a weakness, as you're basically working in balancing which is going which faction is going to win out, and once someone gets a slight lead there, it's very difficult to catch them.

I believe that this is a very fine game design, but its weakness is that it is one of those games that require one to play it through once or twice before fully understanding the scope and strategy of the game. That may, I fear, deter some folks from playing it, as the first game, with very little knowledge of strategy and how it works in Lagoon, could fall very flat very quickly.

I played Lagoon over and over, each time hopeful that my rating would rise. I played solitaire, two-player, and three-player. I thought it obvious that the game would benefit from repeat plays and a greater understanding of how the different tile power interact with each other.

There is so much promise!

Lagoon is all about special powers. In theory, it's a combo-building game meets stock investment game -- such a cool mash-up. The opening is somewhat slow, even automatic. However, the mid-game opens up quickly as the tile powers become more relevant. By the end game, there can be some enjoyable tension even if the chance of a blow-out is high. "Blow-out" is perhaps misleading, though, as the relative point difference between first and second place is less telling of how close a game was if competition for the dominant color was tight. What you are aiming for is to be invested in the correct color, so if one person is collecting red, and the other blue, the competition becomes not about acquiring more of the other color, but instead about trying your best to push the "correct" color towards your side of the balance.

Over time, however, all the promise I described in the paragraph above seemed to vanish. My rating actually dropped over time. The tension I was hoping for never materialized on a regular basis. Games seem like a foregone conclusion too quickly, and the special powers on the cards end up feeling largely superfluous. The design is [i]too[/i] tight, which means it feels more like a tug of war with limited opportunities for interesting strategy than a creative exercise in board, alliance, or resource management. In a word: disappointing.

Beautiful artwork. Awesome components. Thinky gameplay. Much better with 2 or 4 players.

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy it. The key is knowing when to switch support from 1 energy to another. During the game there'll be an ebb and flow of majorities, and being able to read and anticipate it is the key to winning.

What a quirky and different little game this is. My biggest complaint is in the printed final rule book it states that there are elements that are to be ignored as they are for future expansions. SIGH. That means you know you didn't give me all of the game straight away. This hurts my rating of the game out the gates right there. DON'T do this publishers even if you know you are going to expand. 

This game isn't for everyone as you can't think laterally and really are some what out of control on based on how radically tiles can be changed and balances flipped. It's almost worth it to sandbag a bit and run the game down before locking in on a color to be victorious.

The game plays exactly as it is intended to play regardless of player count. A point in favor for this title.

Beautiful artwork. Nice quality tiles. Only played a few times so we don't have the strategy figured out just yet. Does require a good bit of space of you are playing the longer game scenario. Again the artwork is stunning. I want to play this game just to look at it.

Abstract hex-area game with awesome graphics.  Unfortunately the abstract play does not integrate with the theme of spreading Druidic influence through elemental forces so the game fails is connecting theme with game.

There's really not a lot going on here. There are only two ways to score points: unravel tiles or get tokens. There might be no tiles with powers that let you get extra tokens (I didn't see any), so in practice it's all about unraveling efficiently. That's not much to hang a game on, and it got boring pretty quickly.

RATING: N/A
Superb production with the (kickstarter) wooden components, thick tiles and the best artwork I've seen in a game, ever. 
The production totally enhances the experience for me, such that I'm tempted to rate this one a 9, despite it being far more abstract than I would usually play. That seems a bit rash after only 2 games however so I will rate it an 8 for now.

Reluctantly on the Marketplace - too many games, too little space and this is, after all, too abstract for us.

Functional and very pretty, but lacking something. A very mechanical game. 

Also does not play well with 3 because of the rock / paper / scissors system - if two players go for scissors and the third goes for rock, guess who's getting ahead? At four players it becomes a team game. So don't believe the player count, this should be a strictly 2p game.

This was a surprisingly good door prize at Arcticon 2015. Really awesome art, unique mechanics, and infinite replayability. 

I'm not the biggest fan of the shuffling tiles but it's not a big enough gripe to keep me from enjoying the game.

Odd blend of abstract and Ameritrash that doesn't quite sit right.  I've played it only with four, which makes it have a runaway leader problem and way too much chaos.  It's probably better with two.  The paper-rock-scissors nature of the three energies is intriguing, but I'm not a big fan of the high variance of the value of the tiles that you may draw out of the bag.  The abilities can be good, but the color of the tile drawn is often critical.  Tile draws have a tendency to swing the game, and for a game this abstract, that's frustrating.  Tack on art and a theme that feels completely removed from the mechanics, and there's little to recommend this title.

This is apparently a game for my abstract or strategic friends.

As [geekurl=/thread/1301246/even-weirder-review-lagoon-how-eat-dirt-and-influe]a review by Dave Hicks[/geekurl] put it, "If you want to feel like a magic man on a magical quest, this is not that game. This is a game where you feel like you’re playing Hive and Magic: The Gathering at the same time. You glower at the board for not being how you want it to be. Your head probably hurts. Whether or not you like that depends on what kind of person you are."

I have played 1-player, 2-player, and 3-player games (1 of each). This seems to be a game that should be played between players of similar strategic ability. That said, the 3-player game was won by the person who was least sure what was going on (owing to a bit of king-making, which was fine and actually quite enjoyable).

Casual players like the look of the game and the first few turns. As the game progresses, the combinations and permutations of possible actions increase faster.

I also have [gameid=174773].

Be the order of druids that most supports the world of Lagoon's dominant energy.  Refresh and exhaust dual-sided player marker and druid tokens (including the elder druid) to explore, occupy or unravel the dual-side hex tile land sites of Lagoon. The three energies are Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin which have a rock-paper-scissors relationship. Control the most dominant energy seeds and unravel weaker energy producing sites for glory. The meat of the game is coordinating your druid actions with the special abilities of the hexes that come into play. After a couple games the strategy is very satisfying combos. I can easily see expansions for more hexes.

Really looking forward to this one, but might be a bit of a brain burner - so many actions, so many possibilities. we'll see when it arrives.

One of the nicest looking sets of artwork that i think i've seen. Will depend on the printing job but hopefully this will come across in the pieces too.

The art and components for Lagoon are top notch and the game is worthy of them.  The spatial considerations and action chaining are interesting each turn though it can lead to some analysis paralysis, though I found it interesting to see other people feel through their moves and see how it effected your plans.  Trying to manipulate the board to give yourself a good score is a really neat twist on this type of game as well.  It does feel a little abstract, but its not hard to imagine druids walking around this magical wood and tapping into its various sites either.  

All in all a great effort from a first time designer/game company and I'm looking forward to many more enjoyable plays.

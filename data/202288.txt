RATING: 9
Excellent filler!  Yes, there's a lot of randomness in the card draw but that's the primary mechanism - push your luck (and push it you shall).  Accept it as the heart of the game and revel in the simplicity of it.  The game is so fast that I love it just for what it is.  It doesn't need to be anything more.

By the way, it has no real connection to the original game, Medici.  Do not pick this one up for a Medici-like experience.  Yes, there are boats you fill with goods, but that's it.  The mechanics are wildly different.  Just go in knowing that it's a completely different gaming experience.

Most times you here [boardgame]: The Card game, they never really have the same feel... but this one really does feel like Medici.  Changes in the auction for a push your luck mechanism, which I thought worked really well and was fun.  Another neat filler game to come out in 2017, and one I am keeping and looking forward to getting more plays in.

A quick card game more about pushing your luck to collect sets of resources. Players attempt to collect cards from the deck trying to get the most points on their ship and the most of a given resource. Most points (money) at the end of three rounds wins. The rules are easy to explain to new, non-gamers and the artwork is top notch. Game play moves fast and there is a bit of player interaction, trying to figure out what was left in the market, do you need it and do you take cards to block other players. Our first game ended in a tie. With no tie breaker list in the rule book, it was a bit of a disappointment and hence the lower rating. Really looking forward to trying with more players, especially non-gamers. The rating could go up with more plays.

RATING: 8
Very impressed, but shouldn't be surprised.  Players acquire cards and earn payouts at the end of three "trading days".  One a turn, zero to three goods cards can be flipped from the deck into the market line, then 1-3 cards can be taken and loaded onto the player ships.  The last card at the end of the line must be taken.  Cards are the good old Medici goods - spice, fur, etc - and they each have a value in good old Medici fashion.  Scoring is very similar to Medici, and most cash at the end of three days wins.  So, it's Medici with auctions removed, and a neat semi-original/semi-familiar card drafting mechanic inserted.  Feels a lot "easier" to play than Medici, as you aren't spending victory points for your goods.   However, the decisions aren't simplistic, and working the length of the market line creates nice problems and opportunities for knobbling opponents.

Lovely presentation, but it could have been in a smaller box (you really don't need the coins).  

Excellent.

Modern Art Card Game and Ra Dice Game showed us that you can take the auction out of a Knizia auction and still have a pretty good game, thanks to the interesting scoring mechanisms. And I also loves me some Medici, which is second only to Ra IMO among auction games.  However, watching the gameplay of this made me think I would rather just play Coloretto.

RATING: 6
The original Medici is more exciting for me because I like valuation and auctions so much. But the wrinkles this game adds (green cards, black cards, double-good cards) are interesting, as is the push-your-luck card draw. This is a well-designed, enjoyable, light game that might get played more with players who don't like auctions. (But I can't resist wondering if adding Medici-style auctions to this set of cards would be more fun with a group of auction-loving players.)

EDIT: I recently played this several times with 2 players, and I must say it sucked. There was VERY little decision making to do and the points barely grind back and forth until one player is lucky enough to win the harbor more times. This is a 4 with 2 players.

Really captures the flavor of the sister Medici games. The push your luck, card flipping element of the game is becoming a thing in mini games these days, and to be honest, I quite like the elegance of the mechanic. The scoring seemed a bit slanted to needing to win the harbor each round (as the points outstrip only collecting resource sets).

I still prefer the heady purchasing system of Medici vs Strozzi.

Jól sikerült kártyás implementációja a Medici játéknak. Eddig azt hittem, hogy a mediciben a licit a lényeg, de ezzel a játékkal kiderült, hogy maga a húzás legalább olyan fontos. Push your luck, a nagytesótól megismert fineszes, többdimenziós pontozással. Tipikusan bárkinek tanítható, de elég ahhoz képest nagyon mély játék, természetesen jó adag szerencsével.

"Medici without the auction" is an apt description here except that the small tweaks to the card selection make the game more interesting than that sounds. You have to balance short- and long-term scoring opportunities (as in the full game), but here you also have to balance guaranteed goods with FOMO. You always have to take the last card you turn over, and it's more tense than I thought it would be deciding whether to turn the next card. Great production and a very fun game.

RATING: 7.3
The game is a bit more of a push-your-luck game compared to Medici (there is no auction). You can only take five cards per round, but green cards do not count against your limit. It feels like this makes whoever flips green cards very lucky/they get a bigger advantage.

The game played okay with 6 and moved quickly, but this game seems like it may be more preferable with lower player count than high (as opposed to Medici)--since there is only payouts for being first or second in a good and being tied for second is absolutely worthless.

RATING: N/A
3-5 players? By Reiner Knizia. Card game. Set collection. Tableau building. Push your luck. Light complexity, but not a good party game because players should track other players' tableaus, and each player has two tableaus: a ship's hold and a warehouse. Player interaction is limited to claiming cards that other players might want. More exciting than the Medici board game according to Rahdo (youtu.be/oVHL7utbQTY). Video 139313 shows gameplay that has some excitement, but to achieve this, players really need to compare all tableaus before drawing.

Quite surprised how well Knizia is able to convert Medici into a card game sans auctions. The "push your luck" card draw is very reminiscence of the original game and in fact I felt its more important since you're "forced" to take the last drawn card into your tableau. Luck of the draw plays a big part in this game, so you could potentially be screwed due to pure bad luck. Also I don't understand the reasoning behind not having 1-value coins? Way too punishing for tied players for goods to earn so little coins. Despite all that, its a good little filler if you're itching for a Medici game.

Basically a pared-down version of Medici which replaces the auction mechanic with a push your luck card draw.  It works surprisingly well and plays quicker than the full game without a ton of compromise.  This seems easier for new players to grasp then the auction mechanic in the full game but also lacks some of the depth and gamesmanship.  This is a nice addition/companion to the full game and definitely worth owning.

[PNP] Straightforward push your luck game. Reiner Knizia really designs streamlined games that are easy to learn and it is also the case here. Not the deepest game there is but still presents enough meaningful choices and is quick enough to compensate for the luck based nature. Good game overall.

Based on one play with 5 players, the amount of decision making was minimal. Maybe it's due to the reduced boat size? At the two player boat size you have at least 3 rounds of picking up goods, whereas any other player count you probably only have 2. This seems like a small change but it makes a big difference.

Kicsit olyan érzésem van ezzel kapcsolatban, hogy "nincs már ilyen játék?". Annyira egyszerű push your luck & set collection kombó, hogy tényleg azt hinné az ember, ez nem valami új szerzemény. No de amúgy teljesen rendben van ez így, az egyik kedvenc kategóriám a könnyed kártyajáték, ez ráadásul annyira egyszerű, hogy aki kb 30-40-ig össze tud adni számokat, játszhatja. A 2-6 intervallum még rátesz egy lapáttal erre, mert így elég széles körben használható. A kivitelezés szuper, bár az inzerttel nem tudom, hogy mik voltak a tervek, mert a kártyák nem férnek bele, a pénzekhez meg adtak tasakot, de úgy van kialakítva a vájat, hogy bezacskózva nem lehet berakni oda... agyondicsérni nem tudom a tervezőjét. Knizia viszont remek munkát végzett, minimál melóval plusz egy játék került a neve mellé.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

While I see some of the connections to the board game, this reminds me more of Coloretto than Medici except for the scoring mechanisms. I'd play again as it plays quickly, but this pales in comparison to the board game of the same name. No auctions in this one, it is just straight up set collection and you are just drawing cards off the top of the draw deck on your turn.

RATING: 8
I admit, I was skeptical. One of the most famous pure auction games turned into a card game with NO auction? How and why? And yet, it absolutely works. Very similar tension, very similar decisions, except the focus has switched to a luck-pushing card draw instead of an auction. Doesn't replace Medici, but worthy of the title!

Enfin un jeu de Knizia vraiment original.
Il reprend la mécanique de son célèbre hit "Medici", en supprimant les enchères (qui ne plaisaient pas forcément à tout le monde). Cela en fait un jeu ultra fluide, malin, rapide. En un mot : génial. Un grand cru du maître qui prouve qu'il n'a pas perdu la main quand il se force un peu (et ça fait vraiment plaisir !!).

Un mauvais point pour les règles très mal rédigées concernant les bonus de 10 points et ce, dans toutes les langues (un comble !).

There's definitely some "feel" of the parent game here, mainly because of the way the scoring is done. A player at my last session said that it's almost identical to [gameid=5782] and I can certainly see that with the way that each player loads up an "offer" of cards.

Plays pretty fast, I like to play three full games with an aggregate score across the set because there's a "luck of the draw" aspect with drawing cards that allow you to win the £30 for the biggest ship. Having the biggest ship is a very significant route to victory - not quite the dominant strategy, but close.

[b]Medici: The Card Game[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]Medici: TCG was quite fun, in fact much better than what I expected. If you've played the board game everything will click after a couple of rounds. Collecting cards is done via a push your luck mechanic versus the auctions in Medici; however scoring is quite similar [i](boats still score and collecting more of the different goods than your opponents.)[/i] 

Herein lies my only concern, the game is not very intuitive for folks not familiar with Medici and the scoring will be even more opaque for folks you may play with who aren't serious gamers. In my opinion it leaves Medici: TCG as a great, quick filler on a game night, but maybe not very accessible for folks new to the hobby.[/i]

Mostly harmless. In fact I prefer it over the original Medici as it does away with all the incessant and interminable auction garbage (at the cost of rewarding the skill of valuation admittedly), replacing it with a simple draft process (which has a nice twist), by which you gradually gain your 5 cards each round. The rest of the game is virtually identical - same scoring for highest collection, same scoring for most in each set, same scoring for reaching a threshold in a set. The decision each turn is in the Zirkus Flohcati vein - do I settle for the cards available now, or push another card into the draft that might be worse. Sometimes the decision is easy, sometimes it's hard, and inevitably there'll be moments you kick yourself when you eventually see what the next card would have been. All of which is fine. Even better, the game is easy to teach and plays in a respectable timeframe appropriate for its luck level, which makes it much more approachable and replayable. Hence, a higher rating from me than the original.

Another great Knizia auction game has been streamlined into a very interesting and accessible filler. Like Ra The Dice Game and Master's Gallery, Medici the Card game has eliminated the auction of its parent game but maintained the Knizian scoring system.  Here, the auction has been replaced by a push your luck draw/draft mechanism similar to that found in Port Royal. On paper, it does not sound all that compelling, but in practice there are many decision points that are interesting and there turns out to be several things to consider as you watch your "boat" fill.  That said, i do think Medici The Card Game suffers a bit more than Ra the Dice Game and Master's Gallery with the auction being removed.  The push your luck mechanism, though fun, is not quite as competitive as the hand management mechanism of Master's Gallery or the dice in Ra Dice.  It is a bit more luck prone.  I also am not fond of how the rules tell you to deal with ties in the absence of 1 denomination coins.  And perhaps it is lack of experience, but in a two player game the boat scoring seems to dictate the winner nearly every time as someone is going to get 40 points from it minimum.  

As to the components, the cards are quite nice with great artwork.  However, the cards seem to be more prone to chipping than most other linen finish cards.  I have only played a few times now and the corners of the cards already show significant chipping.  The coins are nice but unnecessary. The 5 denomination coins are way too small.  Some of the font on the player aid cards is also too small.  Some of the info on the player aid cards is not intuitive.  The recesses in the plastic insert for the cards could have been deeper as they won't fit the scoring aids.

What a neat 2p filler game. 

It takes a few plays to see that there is a bit of depth to this one. Initially you just draw 3 cards every time and try to make them fit because you assume that the other player will shut you out before you can complete your hand. But you quickly realize that to win, you must play sets and combos. Each round you compete for overall points and that is a 20 point bump, but in addition, set dominance yields a 5 to 10 points depending on whether you are able to shut-out your competitor on that suit. Early on, it is easy to get shut-outs, but as hands build, most players have at least one of each set. But in later rounds, players begin competing for super-sets where you can get 20 points per suit. Getting too greedy or playing it too safe can bite you. You have to take smart chances and know that sometimes they pay off and sometimes they don't. Some games are high scoring and some are low-scoring depending on the pace of the game which is determined by how players interact - whether they have an early opportunity for a super-set or are playing broadly and trying to win or defend many small scoring opportunities.

It's smart, short, has simple mechanics, leads to good player interaction and smack-talking - it reminds me of a really good hand of blackjack where you're splitting and doubling and things get interesting. It is everything that I like from a filler.

Shocked there was no auction mechanic. I suppose if there were then it would just be Medici with no board. Which- might solve the problem of trying to find the best Medici board. I think it is fine push your luck game. I won't be rushing to play it a whole bunch but I will hang on to it for now. It is definitely cute. I rate Medici a 9 though- and it is my clear choice of the 2.

This is a nice light version of Medici. The bidding part of the game has been replaced with push your luck.

RATING: N/A
Pros:
* Very fast setup and cleanup time
* Very portable
* Played well with 2
* Beautiful art and functional graphic design

Cons:
* It's a pretty light game and may not have much staying power.
* Only a con if you sleeve - the insert doesn't fit sleeved cards. Without the insert, the sleeved cards fit fine.

Comparisons:
* I think Jaipur is the better game in this slot, but Medici:tCG is faster to setup, faster to play and scratches a similar itch.
* I've read many comparisons to Port Royal. As a push-your-luck game, I see where they're coming from, but the set gathering in M:tCG has no affect on your card drawing abilities or luck mitigation so I would argue they feel too different to compare.

We played this four times with the wrong rules and were just about ready to give it away when I decided to re-read the rules more carefully.

After drawing 1, 2 or 3 cards, you must take the most recently drawn card (got that part right), but you may then chose to take either or both of the prior 2 cards.

So if you draw 1 2 3 you can take {3} or {3,2} or {3,2,1} or {3,1}.

We played where you could only take {3} or {3,2} or {3,2,1} but NOT {3,1}

That simple ability to decide to skip over {2} makes a HUGE difference. With the incorrect rule, we couldn't figure out where the decisions were. It was harder to make groups of 7 (in a 2 player game) so the person who won two of the shipping phases pretty much always won the game.

With the wrong rule, this game is a 2 or 3 at best. With the correct rule, it will probably end up a high 6 or low 7.

It's a fun light game, very reminiscent of regular Medici and Circus Flohcati. I own both of those already, so I don't find it necessary to add this to my collection. In fact, I don't really recommend it over either of those titles, but it deserves a decent rating none the less.

Another solid minimalist game from Knizia.  As I have come to expect, the rules sound too simple to possibly function, yet they function beautifully and produce a lot of emergent tension.

Comparison:
The card game is a bit more random, a bit faster, and a bit more accessible.  It's also a very compact box.  I'll probably keep both to suit different audiences.  I prefer the original Medici, although the two are different enough that I might keep both -- the original is one of my favorite games of all times.

Concern:
I suspect the dominated strategy in 3p is to focus on point collection rather than goods collection, but I'm not sure yet.  If so, getting 7's might be too lucky.  A simple score table tweak might be in order if the issue persists.

Take the board game and replace the auctions with a push your luck drawing mechanic. The first thing you'll notice is that unlike the board game every player isn't engaged each turn because only one player has decisions to make on their turn. That's not a big deal because the turns are lightning fast. The second thing you'll notice is more significant, because without a board to keep score players are constantly having to look at their opponents and add up scores over and over again. Okay, that's not a big deal because it'd be easy enough to make a little scoring track to throw in with the game. So it comes down to which mechanic you like - auctions or push your luck card draws. If the answer is card drawing then you're in luck - you'll probably enjoy this game. I don't mind it. It comes in at the advertised 30 minute mark and the social encouragement and discouragement to draw or not draw another card puts it in the same group of games as another Knizia title - the dice rolling EXcape. Light and easy to teach, play and enjoy.

Excellent streamlining of an already good game.  Luck-of-the-draw is high but it generally seems to even out (he says, trying to convince himself.)

Despite the merchant theme being done to death, the card version of Medici is a fun little press your luck set collection game. Equally good at 2P to 4P. We upgraded the cardboard coins to great metal Scythe coins since currency is so integral to this game.

Press your luck set collection game. I was really not a fan of green cards. Never played the original Medici, so I am interested in playing that. Not sure if I am interested in playing this card version again.

I like the simple, press-your-luck drafting and set collection.  You stay engaged on other players turns by tracking their ship value and type of goods.  Fun game in a little box.

Gives a lot of the set collection feeling of the original game, but with drafting instead of auctions. This has more luck, but I like the way the set collection works better. A good way to ease new players into the concepts of Medici.

Interesting twist on Medici. It has some of the same feelings but does it in a more "push your luck" style way instead of bidding. Need to try again before forming an opinion on if it is too luck based or the decisions really matter.

EDIT: Played again and it feels a bit more luck based than normal Medici. I like the removal of bidding as it makes it more engaging for newer players, but there are some problems with this that makes it a bit swingy. Not sure which one I like better, but I think they are about on par with each other. Both good but I'd rather play something like Ra.

Distills the classic down to a new package that maintains much of the same feel but removes the auctions.  Add in a dash of push-your-luck and it's perfect.  Plays quickly as well and works for 2.

tl;dr: perfectly average card game

In this game you take some cards from the middle and add them to your tableau. At the end of each round a scoring takes place. So there's no auctions in this game, just majority scoring.
It plays well (as one might expect with a Knizia) and has some interesting choices, but by no means does this break any new ground. Perfectly serviceable to kill some time and gently (very gently) massage your brain, but not more than that.

So I love Medici, and after reading the rules for Medici:TCG, I thought that it was rather plain. But for some reason, there's a certain quality to this game that makes it addictive. Every card pull is a push-your-luck, and do you decide to push it based on what cards that already been revealed? Another excellent Knizia game indeed.

I typically don't love X: The Card Game as much as I love X: The Original Game. So I was curious, but hesitant about this game. I consider Medici a classic and wasn't sure this could compare well to the original.

In this game you flip up cards from the deck which represent (mostly) goods from the original game, which you will be filling your ship with. You can flip up to three cards. You must take the last card you flip and can optionally take the previous one or two cards before that. (And it's acceptable to flip one and take three). Like the original game, you only have so many spaces on your ship to hold goods. Unlike the original, there's some cards that don't take up space in your hold. And there's some cards that have double goods on them.

At the end of each day, you score points for largest ship, transfer goods to your warehouse and then score points for most goods in each good type (with a bonus if you have 5+ of a good). Most points after the third day wins.

I really enjoyed this game. It's different than the original, but successfully evokes the feel of the original game while providing a fulfilling game experience. Many of these "X: The Card Game" types of games remind me of the original game but provide a game experience that isn't nearly as good as the original game. Medici: The Card Game is good enough and different enough that I'm not sure I'd necessarily choose to play the original game over the card game.

I think both games have a place in a collection without stepping on each other. The original Medici is longer and is an auction game. The card game is shorter and while it keeps the tension of the race for most goods/largest ship, it's definitely not an auction game.

Amennyire szerettem Vincent Dutrait-t, annyira kezdem unni, ettől függetlenül már most le szeretném szögezni, h nagyon jó ránézni az asztalra lepakolt színes-szagos kártyákra. A játék az eredetihez képest semmiféle licitálást nem tartalmaz, de ez nekem inkább előny, mint hátrány. Egy push your luck kártyajátékról van szó, melyben a piactérről gyűjtjük be a különféle árukat, amiket aztán 3 fordulón keresztül lepontozunk. Van pár kisebb csavar, de ezek nem bonyolítják halálra a játékot, inkább csak érdekességet csempésznek az ismert mechanikába. Nekem tetszett, ha jó áron ki lehet majd fogni valahol, akkor megpróbálom majd becsempészni a baráti társaságunkba.

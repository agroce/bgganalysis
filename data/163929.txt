GAME: Coconuts Duo
RANK: 2942

RATING: N/A
This game is more of a gimmick than it is a game, but by god, it's fun. I've never heard my kid laugh harder than when flinging little coconuts that look like cat turds at me.

Almost not even a game. And the monkey catapult doesn't work as good as I want it to (hard to aim). But Catapults are amusing, so there's that.

Silly but fun game for when you want something not rule heavy, could have made a few more cards though as there is not many to foil opponents plans. I have acquired some more cards and made my own to throw in there.

If people show up at game night and are waiting for a game, I pull out Coconuts Duo because it is so quick to teach and is a bunch of fun. Who doesn't like throwing coconuts into cups?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
While a two player game of coconuts lacks the chaotic fun of having more players, the new cards and the ability to play the original cocnuts with up to 6 now makes this one totally worth it!

Expansion
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Expands Coconuts to up to 6 players and adds more magic cards. Since Duo came with 12 green coconuts, I would like to make a house rule that each player gets 2 of them t start the game and if you get a green coconut in a cup, you get to draw another magic card. So each player has the potential to get an additional 2 magic cards throughout the game.

our kids LOVE this game! my 2 and 4 year olds can play a fairly decent round of this, with several successful cups!
update 12/16: kids still love it and ask for it-I give in on occasion, but having to search for rubber coconuts after each play is annoying. Definitely more of an activity than game.

Kickstarted for 2 copies.
Still waiting for the f-ing things, 6 months after the delivery date.

How in the hell does a repackaging get delayed by 6(!!!!) f-ing months?
There have been several outright lies told to backers about deliveries being finished. Twice we received an update saying shipping was 'complete' a month apart.

Congratulations Mayday, you made my shitlist, right beside Iello.

That said, this game is pretty damn fun. The kids love it, and I have no problems playing with them at any point. It's a really fun dexterity game, and great for families.

Fun game. We have played with the cards maybe once or twice, as we simply like just trying to get the coconuts. Losing coconuts is highly.

Like its predecessor Coconuts Duo is just plain fun. Its one of those ingenious ideas you wish you had thought of, because lets face it, everyone loves monkeys throwing little brown nuggets across the room. Game play is easy just aim for the cups, get a "coconut" into the cup you get to take that cup and place it on your side. First person to six cups wins. Coconuts Duo definitely gets rid of one of the few problems with its parent, the downtime. With only two players you are quickly tossing those little rubber pieces across the room at lightening speed. The cards add a nice little touch to game play, and can be used in a number of different house rules. Overall Coconuts Duo is a simple joy which likes are rarely found in today's board games.

RATING: 6
Fun to watch the physical gymnastics that the 'rugby-shaped' coconuts perform, but until you get good at aiming (if it is possible) the game lulls a bit with lots of misses and feels it is overstaying its welcome, maybe rectified with at least 3 to increase target area.

RATING: 6
This game has a certain skill to it, and is highly repetitive, which makes it difficult to keep young kids engaged.  My four-year old can make some shots, but not quite as often as older kids or adults that have played before.  Stealing cups by making a long shot is a real setback to a young kid on the wrong end, and close games can switch to a blowout quickly.  With the four-year old, I have started to modify the rules so the kids don't lose cups they have acquired.  Probably best for the six and over crowd, although younger kids can certainly play it.  

My rating involves how eager I am to bring out the game compared to other games for children 3-8 years old.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game for adults and kids. Even my 4 year old plays this (and often beats her older sister). I would recommend picking up a few spare coconuts though as you do tend to loose them.

Can either be used as a standalone two player version of Coconuts, or as an expansion for up to 6 players.  We had so much fun playing the original that we picked this up on the last day of Gencon and before the end of the week we'd actually used it to play a 6 player game.  Good, silly, fun.

Plays the same as the original game but there are different cards.  The sore thumb one is great.  Works just fine as a two player game.  It comes with green coconuts but there isn't anything significant pertaining to them wish there was some variant but the game is good silly fun and look forward to adding it to the base set to play with 5 or 6.

Cute game, just like the original but with special single-use power cards (each person gets 2 at the start of the game) -- these help you, or penalize the other player in some way. Take turns flinging the coconuts into cups. If you get it into a yellow, take it and add to your cup pyramid. If red cup, also take another turn. The first player to build a complete pyramid wins. The game ends earlier if all coconuts are in cups; the player with more cups wins.

Definitely better with just 2 (compared to a full 6-player game, at least).

It's good to support up to 6p; but the game can run long in this case.

The card back of my version is different from the basic game; luckily, this doesn't affect the game much.

No denying the toy factor of this... but if you like dexterity games this is simply a lot of fun for all ages.  Even my normally game averse children really enjoy playing "the grown up way" though launching coconuts at Daddy and stealing my cups have a lot to do with that too...

We enjoyed this so much we ordered the basic game so we could have more monkeys right away!

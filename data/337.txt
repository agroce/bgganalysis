GAME: Circus Flohcati
RANK: 1359

RATING: 7
Rating based on 2 plays with kids, without the 'special' cards - which I can see the need for.

Update: now played twice with adults and realised I played it completely wrongly with the kids.
Anyway, fun filler both ways!

130929 Over the years I just haven't played the game...nor have I felt compelled to do so.  Maybe with kids or something this will change.  My memory of it is a tight little Reiner Design.

100726 looks like this will be a keeper!  Its a quick easy to learn push your luck game but its got some interesting decisions as you go a long.  I think it plays fine for 2P even though it is less meaty than Lost Cities.  Definitely a fun 3+ game tho.

RATING: 6
3 plays / 4,5 players

LIKE: Quick, simple game with minor depth. Turning over a single card is a nice push-your-luck aspect, and the main part of the game. I enjoy how the scoring works, very subtle, very smart.
DISLIKE: Some take-that cards, where one player takes another card from someone else.

OVERALL: I bought this as a quick filler or to play with non-gamers and younger gamers (9 yo). I think it will fit that spot nicely... although if the non-gamers are not paying attention, the game drags.

RATING: 7
Quite a fun filler to play with kids.  The push-your-luck element if fun and so are the cards - and learning a bit of German!  There's a few different ways of playing the cards you have to score, so there's something to think about.  It's not the deepest game that Knizia's ever made, but it's not a bad one.  It could also be played with adults - as a filler or over a bottle or two of wine.

You've got to love those fleas...a horrible creature made cute here.

Star Wars Ep 2 versionTo turn it back into Circus Flohcati (per Snoop)...You can remove the:(1) Mission Discs(2) Clone Trooper Cards, and the(3) Nute Gunray Cards (jokers)...and you've basically got Circus Flohcati.  I felt that the Mission Discs were superfluous, because they were pretty easy to get, and most players usually got them with with no problems. The players who *didn't* get them were hammered pretty hard for being unlucky.  The Clone Trooper cards I REALLY hate. Just added, random bonus points for those lucky enough to draw them. The game is already random enough without them.  And the Nute Gunray cards are simply jokers. See comments for Clone Trooper cards.  --  The good thing is, you can play either way, using the above rules or not.

i had played this is in the past, but forgot to rate it.  i decided to wait until i played it again to do so, because my memories of it were so foggy.  now i kinda know why they are, as there isn't an awful lot to remember, but the game is still modestly fun and certainly quick.  now that i've played it again i'm sure it'll be easy to remember the rules and such.  i think king's breakfast, geschenkt, etc are better games but this one is probably the easiest to teach and play of any of my card game fillers.

RATING: 9
(Rated as a family game) One of our favorite family games. There's a press-your-luck element to it which is fun. There's also choices to be made about which sets to lay down and which ones to keep in your hand. The game plays very quickly. And the setup is nice, you just shuffle up the cards and then start.My 6 year old and 8 year old can play it and understand the choices that they're making during the game. I like it that there are different ways to score points and different end game condition, but that the game stays very simple.

Also, the cards themselves are of good quality and have fun artwork.

Edit: Still like this game, but it's slowly getting replaced by Sushi Go

A true filler.  It plays so fast and fun and with some good choices.  I finally played it with my kids and it went over very well.  It's very similar to Duck, Duck, Bruce but better because, as my daughter said, "it provides you with more choices."  Still simple filler and also good with kids.

Fun, short game. Mostly luck based although there is a bit of strategy in what to take as far as colors you don't have in your hand and what card numbers still have the most matching cards left in the deck. There can be some "take that" to it with the action cards or if you take cards to disrupt your opponents.

Great, light filler, with push-your-luck being the main appeal.

Essentially, this is a set collecting game where you can either take one of the face-up cards, or flip cards until you find what you want.  However, if you flip a card of a color that is already on display, you lose your turn completely.  Good tension between going for a better card or busting!

I have found the perfect game for my 5 year old to play with the whole family.  I even like it, as do the grandparents.  Locke has a lot of fun playing the game and it is hilarious watching him play.  He is super cute.  "Keep Going.... keep going... ok let me look at my cards...  give me the 4!!!"  He has his own strategy of making sets of 3, but has more recently realized that he should also take 6s and 7s.  I am just glad we have a game we can all enjoy and Locke can just do his own thing, but still be very competitive with it.

RATING: 5
Maybe we didn't play it right? Or the social element failed here? Based on a few plays one day, it didn't work for me, but maybe it could do better. Maybe it was my mistake to think of this as a game for adults?  Not as good as I hoped, but there is a little bit of a game there.  The push-your-luck element (a mechanic I like a lot) wasn't as delicious as I wanted it to be, like it is in Beowulf. Update: Maybe I applied the wrong combination the Rio Grande rules and the original German rules. The combo I applied seemed to remove the thin ration of strategic choices in the game, compared to the potential. It may be worth another try... What variations make the best push-your-luck game?  -- 1. You must (not "may") play a triplet when you collect that third card, however you collect it;  2a. When you're adding cards to the display, you *must take* a color match (thus forcing possible triplet play if combined with "Must play a triplet" rule, thus when you add cards to the display you risk high card or Gala Show collection), or 2b. *must discard* it and lose your turn;  3. "Ask for card" = ask around the table for a card color, or one player for any card which then must be shown to all?  4. Play with or without Gala Show (10 big points) due to effect on viability of other choices? ...I don't know, maybe some combination works well. I'm willing to try again under conditions of incipient hilarity.

I'm not a big fan of the card games, generally...but this one works for me.  Its a pleasing filler...plays quickly and the zany flea art does the trick.  It cracks me up.

The game is probably a bit better than my rating, but my bias against card games dings it a notch.

A short, simple and wonderfully effective filler with a push-your-luck mechanism.  It does seem difficult to win without the gala show, but I have seen it done - especially in games with a larger number of players.  It's unfortunate (and a little annoying) that there are now different rule sets (Rio Grande's Circus Flohcati has some different rules than Amigo's Zirkus Flohcati).  It means one must decide on the rules they want to play and check with other players who might be used to different rules.

I give the Star Wars-themed reworking of this game an 8.  (It now has its own listing in the Geek database.)

Components: Great quality cards, and colors which are easy enough to distinguish (a feat, given that there are ten colored suits) though often difficult to name. The usual Amigo linen finish gives the cards great snap.

Experience: The game is quick and surprisingly entertaining for such a simple mechanism. It's a lot of fun to slowly build up my hand, and make tough decisions about settling for a face-up card or chancing the deck. The two specialty attack cards add just enough interaction that it is possible to throw a wrench in someone else's gears.

Simple play: Take any card on the tableau, or draw a card and add to the tableau -- if it matches the suit of a card already on the tableau ("no whammies!") you lose your turn. Otherwise, you get one card each turn and you're trying to obtain one of all 10 suits and/or rank triplets. Circus theme is colorful if not relevant, and the press-your-luck aspect is fun for all ages. We've played this lots.

Hey, this is pretty close to Ra (in many ways) but without the auction, of course.  Push your luck, collect when you can, make the best set(s).  Good stuff.

Excellent small and fast set collecting game with a strong push your luck element. There are differences between the English and German edition rules, so make sure you know which you are using before starting.

RATING: 6
This is a combination push your luck, set collection game. There is a deck comprised of ten suits and each suit has 8 levels (0 through 7). You flip over the top card of the deck and form a line. You're looking to complete a set of ten cards, one from each suit. Along the way you can collect triplets of numbers and meld them to make them safe. The first person to collect the ten different suits calls a gala event and scoring takes place. Repeat for each player in the game and get a total score.
The game has a fun aspect and my wide wins this game far more often than chance would allow. So, there is something going on here that I don't see. I'll play the game, but it's not one of my favorites.

RATING: 6.27459
Played with 6. Maybe slightly too many?

A fairly 'mechanical' game with no theme. Almost abstract.

The special cards reward memorisation, as does the existence of sets, but it's never overbearing nor feels essential.

Collecting the higher cards seems the fastest way to win (specially with so many players) and it turns into a push-your-luck game with some vague notion of probability being rewarded.

Largely luck-based, a player could theoretically win or lose purely based on the draws. However, someone memorising more draws and discards and making more intelligent decisions based on the probabilities when choosing to reveal or choose would be far more likely to win.

I did enjoy it but feel that evaluating probabilities and memorising cards aren't skills I'd enjoy practising regularly.

We were looking for a 6-player game, at which point simultaneous action becomes a big boon.

This is a very good game for teens and preteens. That is not to say adults will not enjoy it. You are trying to get high numbered cards in as many of ten suits as possible. You get a bonus if you have a card in each suit and there are ways to get points with your extra cards obtained during the game. During your turn you may turn over as many cards as you want as long as you do not turn over a suit already showing (bad) or an action card (good). If you choose when to stop you then take any one card showing to your hand. All in all pretty simple and fun.

UPDATE: Has improved on me after more plays and bumping up rating. 

There are alot of card game fillers out there and this one in particular didn't interest me that much. The press your luck factor is kind of neat, but there just isn't enough in this one to justify leaving the standard 52-card deck in the drawer.

Fun factor and push-your-luck element are appealing.  Cute artwork.  Decent filler, even younger children enjoy it.

The rules have changed with the Rio Grande edition, details here: [thread=1543508][/thread] (also older thread discussing differences [thread=29623]here[/thread]).  

I favour the original rules which gives a 10 point bonus for a "[thread=29079]Gala Show[/thread]", i.e. a 10-point bonus for ending the game by displaying a hand containing all 10 colors.  This gives some incentive to keep low cards like 0s and 1s in hand.  More playtesting needed for a final verdict on this.

A reasonable filler.

A slightly strange push-your-luck card game. You turn over cards until you decide to pick a card up, unless you turn over a card of the same colour as one that is already there - in which case turn over. 

Scoring is a combination of three numbers-of-a-kind played in front of you plus the highest of each colour in your hand.

I really like 'Flea Circus' because of the options in strategy you can use.  Going for the 'gala' or collecting the high numbers - the game seems to change an little each time you play it.  Of course the strategies vary with the different number of players on this one too.  I also like that it can be pretty much played anywhere and doesn't require too much set up or explaining.

[Original comment] Good family card game; no reading required, but involves planning and decision-making somewhat. Popular in our family game group.

(December 2006) We find this to be a good game for introducing people to Euro-style card games, and we play it fairly often. It works as well with 7-8 players as with 5-6.

May 2009 -- We still play this game a couple of times a year and have fun with it.

October 2011 -- I am surprised that this game still appeals to us, after having played it for many years. I suppose the simplicity and quick game time have much to do with it. It does not require a lot of deep thinking, so it is a good game to play with unrelated conversations going on at the table.

Quite light "push your luck" game. Very accessible and one of my most played games (it's easy to teach, fast to play, and often ends with calls for "one more time").

It's critical that a game-ending gala be worth only 5 points, rather than 10. This might not seem that huge a difference, but it means that you can't just blindly play for a gala. (The first eleven games I played with the original rules were won by the player who had a gala.)

[Initial Impression: 7]
A fun little game that's fast and incredibly easy to learn. A turn consists of: Flip cards, take a card, lay down sets of 3 cards if you wish. Scoring is also easy: 10 points per set of 3 on the table, plus face value of one card of each color in your hand (plus 10 points for having all ten colors if you play the Gala Show version). It's important to remember what your opponents have, and sometimes you should pick a card that, if left available, will benefit an opponent. Take some risks hoping for better cards, but take too many and you'll lose your turn (which really hurts - for every turn you lose, you're giving up potential points). Easy enough to play with kids, fun and interactive enough to play with anyone.

Another fun, light, and fast card game from Knizia centered around a flea circus.  There are 10 "suits" with card values from 0 to 7.  This is a press-your-luck & set collection game where you are trying to get cards in each "suit", but only the highest value card of each suit counts towards your score.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Children's game, but a little more than just a set collection game thanks to good Doktor Knizia.

The books of tens are very basic, but the card memory needed to recall what might be a neighbor's hand is key, and having to discard someone else's target card because it matched a face-up color is priceless.

Then there's the pull between playing that book, or saving the three cards to use as high-scorers at game end, which is also a nice little action that is game critical.

All in all still a family game, but these fleas have meat.

There are plenty of light, quick card games out there.  This is one.

It's really about trying to predict what the value of the cards is going to be at the end, so it has a strong press-your-luck element which I enjoy.  The special cards add a little flavor, but can occasionally become annoying when your opponents steal your cards.  Interesting but doesn't stand out.

I guess this game is fine, but I certainly wouldn't ever request it and I'd always try to play something else.  It works alright as a party game because it doesn't take much thought.  The new human-flea crossover artwork is a bit creepy.

First played this on April 6th, 2007.  This is a quick learn and very fast game.  It's a bit adictive and fun as well.  We played with three players and it might be more fun with more.  I'd recommend giving this a game play try or two.  There is a decent balance of luck and skill in this game as well.

Very fun light filler game that does what it sets out to do very well.  A push-your luck set collection game that plays very rapidly and entertains, presenting players with stimulating, light choices.  I found teh game to be very fun.  There is zero theme in this game, it is about collecting cards with particular numbers and colors in each player's efforts to maximize their score.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Circus Flohcati is a quick, painless game of luck and planning with a marginally entertaining theme (I'm refering to the occasional humming of the circus show song here).  Sure you can be screwed by luck or handed a whole lotta points, but the melds and Gala show mechanic keep it interesting.  This is a good contender for enjoyable filler for everyone.

Sep08: Another Knizia filler.  I like the zero setup time that this game offers.  Shuffle the deck and play.

It also offers interesting decisions on every turn.  Do you flip up just one more card?  Which of the available cards are worth taking?  Do you lay down that set or not?  Do you shoot for the grand Gala?

The scoring is simple enough to explain, but still has that Knizia touch.  All of your decisions are driven by that simple scoring method.

I need to try this one with some more players now.

Very quick and light filler that is pure push your luck, with a little set collecting and last only about 10 minutes which is just right for this.   

Its harmless and decent, we like push your luck and its got two ways to score so its decent, but I do own better fillers than this, including push your luck ones IIRC. 

Still I will likely keep it around, its nice and small and has almost no rules to learn, and plays in 10 minutes flat

RATING: 7
Fun little push your luck filler game which plays fairly quickly. I like how you have to make decisions if you're gonna be greedy and aim for the 10 set points or just go for individual card points. Also I played with the Japanese version which makes no sense at all in terms of the theme but has very beautiful artwork.

RATING: 6
While it's certainly not the most engaging game in the world, it's a little bit fun especially for non-gamers.  The luck factor is pretty heavy so far as the card draws go and the game is completely dependant on drawing well. The key is knowing when to draw for the final hand and when to just take a showing card to form sets. This is good for a quick 20 minute game and we play this during our work lunchtime.

Fun light game with some interesting decisions to make. Another hit from Knizia (who lately has failed to excite me with his newer games). It has a very high luck factor, almost no strategy and a weak theme but as it plays quickly I don’t care. It offers a lot of fun in a very short time frame.

It is ideal to play with your family and non-gamers friends.

I still like Circus Flohcati, it is easy to teach and fun to play. However, I´m on a crusade to get all my ratings up to date so I’m downgrading its rating to a 6.0. This is a game I like to play from time to time, but not every time. I will play it sporadically.

After another play, Now I find the game too light for my current tastes. The decisions are obvious (for the most part) and it has a lot of uncontrollable luck. It also have some “take that” and I don’t enjoy it as much as before.

Due to this I’m downgrading its rating and I’m selling the game ASAP.

I enjoy this game in much the same way I enjoy Coloretto.  This game has a bit of the push your luck element that I like,it adds tension.  The special action cards make the need for counting cards high, it helps a lot to remember what cards your opponents have already played, which ones they are holding in their hands, and which ones have already been discarded.  A quick, interesting game.

Yet another title by Knizia with a simple premise that generates interest more from the approach to scoring than from the mechanics. The game consists of ten card suits numbered 0-7 and 9 action cards. Players optionally draw until they want to stop and then take a card, or until they draw a suit already showing and their turn ends without taking a card. When a player collects one card of each suit (or the deck runs out) the game is over. Players can optionally lay down "trios" during the game (three cards with the same number) for 10 points each. You also get 10 points for going out first. Then you add up the highest card of each suit you have in your hand. Most points wins. (The RGG rules are different.)

The key decision in the game is whether or not to go for trios. They are worth points, but reduce your chances of going out first and getting more points at the end. That's pretty much the game right there. Not a bad filler, but not a great one, either. The original cartoon artwork was fun and funny, making this really appealing for kids if nothing else. The art on the new edition is creepy as they use life-like flea heads on human bodies. Ick.

Pleasant fast playing filler.  Players draw cards in 10 suits of values 0-7.  Only the highest value held by a player in each color scores.  Enjoyable risk aspect in which players draw more cards, hoping to find a good one, at the risk of busting.

RATING: 7
This has been a hit with non-gamers. We play with these variations from the official rules:

1) "Gala Show" gives a 5 point bonus rather than 10
2) No choosing a direction for "Pull" and "Request" cards, they always go clockwise
3) When you take a card from another player via Pull or Request, you must give them a card from your hand

RATING: 7
A real favourite in our informal group of old uni friends (who are mostly non-gamers but all cleverer than me).

Why is the game attractive to non-gamers?  I think this is because;
1) It is easy to explain but even easier to play
2) Requires a surprising level of thought and attention beyond the suggested simplicity of set-up and theme
3) Some interaction but light enough for no-one to be offended if they get picked on
4) Quick to play

A weakness of the game however is that to win you need cards and there is sometimes a disencentive to turn cards - this becomes more pronounced in 3 player games - especially if there is a real push your luck player in your midsts.  Therefore I prefer the game with either 4 or 5 players where this strategy is slightly mitigated and the action cards come more into play.

Strongly recommended if you have opportunities to play with non-gamers or for those who enjoy the lighter side of life.

A simple but elegant game by Reiner Knizia.  Collect cards of different colors and the highest value of each color is your score.  You can also score by collecting sets of 3 cards of the same color to get 10 points.  It is very simple press your luck mechanic of flipping a card from the top of stack and taking one card.  However, if you flip and get the same color card, you do not get to take a card.  

This is very quick and very fun.  Great for kids and a good filler game.

This made the game seem rather pointless which may account for low score. Trouble is now cannot get this back to the table.
Now have got back to the table and this is great. Its push your luck, good decisions about what to makes sets of and when to get out.

At the basic level you create sets of low numbers, then there is the small spanner in the works of taking cards from opponents. Really good rating 4-> 8

It felt almost too simple. So simple that the strategy eluded me.

I just don't see it right now. I need to come back to this one and give it another fair hearing. The Japanese artwork is lovely.

Pretty fun.  Simple set-collecting game with a bit of "push-your-luck" added.  Some good decisions to be made too.  Sets are worth 10 points a piece, but go for some high numbers and they'll add up as well.  Throw in just a few event cards that allow you to steal a card from an opponent and such (while not being the focus of the game) and you have a great well-rounded title to play with children and adults.  Some good opportunity for practicing math as well with the scoring.

Update: upgraded to a "9" rating.  This is great to play with just adults as well.  Awesome game for it's simplicity and quick play.  Good level of depth too.  Very happy to own this one.

Played 15-20 times. Nice, simple game. You actually score higher by keeping high cards in your hand rather than playing them as sets. I´m not sure if this is intentional as playing sets is probaly meant to be the main strategy.

Knizia. 3-5. Best with 3 or 4 says BGG poll.

                                                   I only recently discovered this game, and it is definitely in the filler category, but it's
                                                   really good filler. It's a good combination of jeapordy (flip one more card, or not?)
                                                   game and set collecting. The multiple paths to victory (despite claims I've read
                                                   elsewhere, the non-Gala players do win sometimes) makes it a quite filling little filler.

Game is okay, but I traded my German.  The RGG version has a number of rules changes that I don't like.  Putting symbols on the RGG action cards rather than text is understandable, but the graphics are poor.  Card quality has gone down and the card backs are tacky.  If I get this again I'll probably go for the Attack of the Clones version.

Definitely nothing special. Knizia tries his hand at push-your-luck. Plays fairly well with 3, but with 4 or 5 it becomes chaotic too fast and there is little way to control the content of your hand. The game is too short to develop a good strategy, but at the same time any longer and it would overstay its welcome.

I love this edition's art.  It is clearly inspired by Dadaism and has that cut and paste aesthetic with the variety of types and the irreverent humor combining the circus performers with fleas for this flea circus card game.  The art is a treat and the initial reason I even ordered the game.  

The game plays smoothly and we have had fun at various player counts.  Give it a go.

Light and fast card game from Knizia. There are 10 suits, valued from 0 to 7. On your turn, you flip over a card, which you may keep and your turn is over, or flip over more cards to attempt to get the card you need, but if the suit of a new card matches those already revealed this turn, you lose your turn. Action cards allow you to draw cards from your opponents or other abilities. Score for three of a kind, and the highest in each of your suits, and having one of each suit. Cute game, fairly luck oriented, fairly fun.

[Zirkus Flohcati] Cute little game with nice tension. I like the graphic in Zirkus Flohcati edition. Often I play it without special cards. Star Wars edition has some interesting twists too so I like both editions. It works well with any number of players between 3 and 5.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  You can teach pretty much anyone this game. It is incredibly simple. I will admit it’d be be slightly harder for color blind people, but because the colors correspond with a circus occupation, and the occupation is in large white letters, I think it wouldn’t be too much of a challenge.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  Like pretty much any push your luck game, there is a lot of excitement when you actually do take risks. The entire table watches in anticipation each time a card is pulled, and you can see everyone’s excitement culminate into either satisfaction ir disappointment depending on what card was drawn.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  From hearing discussion about this game, I feel like I’m the only person on the planet that likes the new art more than the older edition. The new art was interesting melding the fleas and the human bodies. Granted, they would fit right in to a horror movie, but they really aren’t scary or creepy considering the theme of the game.

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] Luck defines this game. I don’t think that’s a problem since I know what I’m hopping in to, but to people that dislike luck, I doubt games like this would appeal to you anyway... But the genre of this game is push your luck so if you're going into this game not expecting luck then something's wrong with you. I didn't mark down the rating for this, because it's what I like about the game, but it's a con for people that may consider it so.

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] The font makes the numbers hard to read at a first glance. It's nothing horribly debilitating, but it's an problem that really shouldn't be present.

[i][COLOR=#33CCFF]Final thoughts:[/COLOR]  I enjoy this game quite a bit for it's small footprint, ease of getting to the table, and excitement produced by the push-your-luck element to the game.               [/i]

This was an impulse buy, but it turned out to be pretty catchy. I really like the ridiculous art. There'a absolutely no rhyme or reason for it, yet it works for me. I never would've guessed that 1920's-style photographs of circus performers with the heads of crickets attached would be so freaky and appropriate all at once.

It's a quick, simple push-your-luck, set-collection card game by Knizia. Not much to say here. Whatever it may lack in some people's opinions I find is made up for in the art direction and quick playing time. An average game can be balanced out by an over-the-top, art direction.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]I was given a copy of Circus Flochati from my buddy Mat and played a few more times, but I've yet to introduce it to my family. I was very thankful that I got a copy of the older Rio Grande edition, I really don't like the creepy flea people photos used in the new edition.

Circus Flochati remains an excellent push your luck card game that plays quickly so there are plenty of opportunities to pull it out and play. I would highly recommend this game for just about anyone, it's great for families and gamers alike.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This was a surprise hit since I knew very little about the game and wasn't excited to play after the quick rules explanation. However; this ended up being a very fun, push your luck game that would be accessible to younger children (I'd love to try it with my youngest daughter who's 6). I'd previously played Port Royal, which I know has been a hit with many, but was less than impressed. I thought Port Royal ran on way to long for the decisions you make in the game and it wasn't as accessible as Circus Flohcati. I'll be looking to add a copy to my collection, but I would prefer the older Rio Grande version.[/i]

If I had to pick a favorite designer, Knizia, The King of Fillers, would probably be the closest to align with my tastes as a player. His games are smaller in scope, but heavy on strategic and meaningful decisions; they have simple rule sets with fast, one-action turns. And Circus Flohcati is no exception. Combining a push-your-luck mechanic with set collection, the game may look cute and playful, but there are many things to consider. This game remains one of my favorite ways to break up Euros and build up my confidence after being demolished in the last game. And this edition has great art!

RATING: 10
100+ plays. One of the best push your luck games out there. There are constant decisions to make, calcing the odds of possible gain, whether to go for the sure thing (pick up a low scorer with the expectation to meld it later for better points) or hang out and push for high scorers which are then denied the other players. But then a hand of all high scorers will be targetted by the 'steal' cards, so what balance of high vs low is best given the state of the draft as it comes to you each turn? Very quick to play (10 minutes), lots of fun groans, and the rating reflects that it fills its niche (opener, filler) perfectly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting way to acquire cards in your hand, as there is no "draw a card" phase. Easy to learn. Artwork is hilarious. 

For kids and families (including the grandparents), this should be a household staple game over Go Fish or Old Maid, because though this is an easy game, it still requires making thoughtful choices.

As light fillers go, Circus Flohcati is top-notch.  It'd probably only be a 6 if it weren't so fast and engaging.  Yeah, it's random, and yeah, you can get amazing flops or terrible ones, but we keep coming back to it again and again and I keep wanting to play.  There's a surprising amount of strategy as to when you pull the trigger on trios versus aiming for galas; while the person who galas *usually* wins, they don't always.  It's also super-easy to each, which is always a plus.

I'm not a huge fan of push-your-luck games, but this one is clever and fun.  There is a rather large luck element, and keeping track of what everyone else has is too hard to be worth it.  However, it's light and easy enough to make one look past those flaws.

OWN Xmas 04 (Circus Flohcati version).  Didn't like it without the 'gala' show, so we added it as 5-points with 4 players, and 10-points with 5 players.  Still worth nothing with 3 players.

ALL the Colors!! I love all the colors! Card game with SOME push your luck. You are trying to form sets and a collection of all the color cards (10). It is definitely cute.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've played a few of the "push your luck" style games, but for me this still stands as the best after now 10 years (sheesh). Most of the other designs rely on dice (Can't Stop, Exxtra, Pickimino, Cloud 9), so one reason why Circus is better is there is increased skill of probability assessment with the card deck in determining if you will be blowing out your turn in the pursuit of gain, instead of the more lucky roll of the dice. Circus has the same sitcom fun and groans when someone makes or breaks on their turn, but the card game heightens the tension due to the inherent set collecting commentary: my adrenalin kicks in when I see or draw a card for either a trio or finishing the game on a gala (which is more possible in a 3 player). Also the action cards provide some catchups, further groans and tension as well as an added incentive to push your luck. With dice there is the problem of spectator status but with cards non-turn players have to be attentive to do well by anticipating or pursuing a desired card from a player. What more can you ask for, except a push your luck design for 2 players or for more 5 (Diamant didn't work for me in the latter regard)? Like I say one of the best of it's type with only Beowulf coming close.

RATING: 9
An excellent quick game with set collecting and push your luck elements, that requires the player to make a choice between scoring now and keeping a big and diverse hand for the end scoring.

The theme could be anything. It is an abstract game at its core, as most of Knizia's games are.

The rules are simple and elegant but come together to make a deeper game than one would think at first glance.

Yet my 6 year old can play this one and almost be my equal.

Knizia at his best.
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
All plays with 5 players. Very fast and easy game to play. A good dose of luck but a little strategy (when to use up turns for triples). The game ends so suddenly that losing a turn or more by pressing-your-luck can be fatal; so taking what's available (usually low cards which are good for making triples) can be the best 'plan'.

I've had this on my gameshelf for a few years.  My initial play with my wife and little girl left us wondering what's the big deal.  It sat on the shelf until I kept seeing people mention it in geeklists so I had to try it again.  I'm glad I did,  it really is a fun little filler that I can't wait to try with a bigger group. My rating could improve.  3.16.06  Definitely one of my favorite fillers. Rating increased to 8.  8.13.06  My favorite filler now.  Quick and easy both to explain and setup.  Bumped to 9.

This is coming from someone that generally enjoys more complicated games, but I like this game. It's simple. It's something you could play with pretty much anyone that knows their numbers and colors, but there's quite a bit for anyone.

There's a push your luck element that I really enjoy, in that you can keep drawing cards but if you draw a card type that has already been drawn, the turn goes to the next player. This actually provides a surprising amount of thinking if you want to draw a card for a high number, or just take a small number and not risk losing your turn because you drew a duplicate type. 

Small numbers aren't absolutely useless, though. You can match 3 cards for a total of ten points, which can be a handy strategy if you have a really high number of a type of card, and there are a lot of that type of card on the table at that moment.

Overall I'd suggest getting this game if you have a bit of extra money to spare. It is a bit simplistic for me to suggest prioritizing it highly, especially because I feel like this game doesn't have the replay value to warrant being one of your first/only games.

The very rare Knizia that doesn't work for me. Two of the core mechanics (memory, and "take that") make this less-than-wonderful. I'd play it, but Circus Flohcati will never be a favorite.

The game is more fun than the simple rules will let you believe. It's one of those fillers where the 'catch' of the game isn't apparent in the rules (play down cards valued 3 or less, keep cards above that value), and players will only realise it once the game is in motion. Some players who tried this found the gameplay mechanical and dry, others loved the push-your-luck aspect. I stupidly tried this game with 2P (which isn't even listed on the box) and regretted it as the game just dragged on.

This is a decent childrens game that is suitable for a filler.  I admit there are some good laughs, as the game screws people in the most retarded way.  Regardless, I feel that the penalty for not making the most obvious decision is just way too steeped in luck and potentially rotten consiquences to be worth it.  This essentially means you play with what you are given, which can be moderate or you try to go for something bigger.  This risk taking element can be exciting in a game like Shark, but it is too sudden and just results in a lost turn here.  This is what I hate about most press your luck games. Any game where losing a turn is ever considered as a good basis for a mechanic generally loses serious points in my book, this is no exception.  I'd play it again, if coerced, but I'd never request it.

Works well for three.  I wonder whether I'll burn out on it since the basic strategic considerations are pretty obvious after a few plays.  Luck and the choices other players make still keep individual hands interesting and different from previous ones, but, over time and with repeated play, I'm finding less to think about.  Then again, it's such a short game that it's never tedious.

I did burn out -- lowered rating from a 7 to a 6.  But I'd stick by the 7 for people new to the game.  Definitely worth playing.  Just not worth playing until you're sick of it!!

RATING: 6
It's just a quick little push-your-luck set-collection game. Cards are numbered 0-7 in 10 colors, with a few extra special cards thrown in. Shuffle and make a draw pile. On your turn, flip cards until you decide to stop (add one of the face up cards to your hand) or you draw a card whose color matches another face up -- in that case, discard that card and end your turn. On your turn you may also play a set of 3 cards (same #, different colors) down in front of you -- worth 10 VP and end of game. The special cards allow you to either draw randomly from a player's hand, ask for a color and direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) - first player who has a card of that color gives it to you, or keep flipping cards until you decide to take one or you flip a color match - but your turn doesn't end, you still get to choose a face up card. The game ends at the end of the turn when someone draws the last card from the draw pile, OR when someone plays a full set of cards (all 10 colors) on their turn. At the end of the game, cards in hand are worth face value, but only 1 card per color. Most points wins!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I enjoy the mechanic of revealing cards in the hope that one you want will be revealed before a duplicate color appears.  I'm still unsure of the optimal strategy, but have had some success going for a "gala show" as quickly as possible.  A light fun game that only takes 10-15 minutes.  Okay with two players but better with more.

RATING: 6.5
[RGG 'Circus Flohcati' 2004 edition] {Animal, filler, kid; set collection, luck-pressing; optimal 3-4p} An enjoyable filler with luck-pressing element. It's fast-paced; a game usually runs within 15 minutes. The rule is simple and children can learn it easily. 

The theme is weak but the artwork is cute. A cue card should be provided to show all 10 colours. I can't name all colours correctly in my first play.

The 'sudden death' rule is very important (though many one ignore) or the game will be very static. It'd be better if more player interaction is involved: e.g. add a function card to rotate 3 cards to the right/left.

Players make only one kind of decision each turn: picking a card (value/colour) or opening a card. I haven't yet found a good strategy in CF though I usually won. Maybe, strong memory and good mathematics can help one evaluate the risk much better than others. I usually opt for a balance hand between the low- and high-value cards. I also try to collect all colours.

[German and English rule differences] Either play is similar fun for me. My friends and some geeks like the original 'Gala Show' rule but I don't think this rule really makes the game much better; it has pros and cons, still.

There is something amiss under the big top.

Maybe this one is on me.  I have yet to come across a worthwhile experience with any game that features a push your luck mechanic.  For a while,  I thought that this type of game just wasn't my cup of tea - but I am intrigued by odds and statistics, so, ostensibly, that flies in the face of logic - hence I continue to try them. 

I have tried all the usual suspects in this genre and if I had my druthers,  I would gather them all together in a neat little pile and commence with a bonfire.

But I am holding out hope ,  that someday a game will be published with this mechanic that pushes all the right buttons with me....or just maybe,  it's time to conclude,   that the push your luck mechanic and me - are in all likelihood,   lousy bedfellows.

Played it and initially thought, "eh". But after repeated play, I came to like it more and more.

Another good Knizia filler. I really enjoy the luck-based aspect of the game since fillers are meant to be more luck based anyways. A good game and certainly a hoot with the right crowd as it can get rowdy.

The game is light and intended as a filler and for lighter audiences. Still fills a niche and I enjoyed it tremendously.

Simple simple simple. Very crowd dependent.

RATING: 6
The push-your-luck element is pretty basic, but a fun family-weight design all the same. Going for triplets over a Grand Exposition (or whatever the "collect one each of all the suits" is called) makes for some basic tension, but the variable end-game can make plays drag.

For my money Medici: The Card Game makes for a more interesting push-your-luck, flip-cards-over-from-the-deck game, but it's also descended from Medici, which I love the crap out of.

A fun push-your-luck and set collection card game. A bit tricky for kids to manage a large hand of cards, the game works much better now that I let them use card holders.

Отличная красочная игра. На первый взгляд - ненапряжная, под пивко. Но желательно держать в памяти приобретения соперников, чтобы сыграть успешно. Одного верного тактического алгоритма и везения мало.
Партия длится 15-20 мин. Не требует большой поверхности стола. Хороший дачный или ж/д филлер.

A great filler game that I'll always play. I'm liking the ZIRKUS rules over the CIRCUS rules. You can find the original Zirkus rules in the files section of BGG.

Dropped the score a bit after multiple playings.  I still enjoy it, but it seems to be far too dependent on luck to develop any manageable strategy.

A light 15-minute game of collecting sets and managing your hand. There is a push-your-luck element as you can try to go for better cards at the risk of losing your turn. Seems a bit too light for me.

Rummy 500 type of game where you lay down sets and can try to go out via a "gala" to end the game.  Good filler and we have been playing it with 2 just fine.

Very simple card game. Playable by kids once they can add numbers up into the high double digits.

Not very good two player, but now that I've played it with three, it's fun! Especially if you get into "stealing" fleas that you know another player wants. Raising the rating.

UPDATE: The more I play this, the more I like it. Raising my rating to 7.5. This is a great filler, especially with kids.

This game really works for our family. The rules are rather simple, so our 7 year-old grandson can join in. At the same time there are decisions to be made and basic strategies to consider. Add the tension of a "push-your-luck" and you have a very enjoyable game for the whole family.

Nice filler, I like it alot.  

Last time I played a friend mentioned a time he called me out for trying to end the game early via the 10 different colors rule.  I was already more than half way there in this game and I made it!  Luckily some good high cards early on got me the win with 45...  Only 3 points away from second place!

That game reminds me about our family trip to Hokkaido. We bought it especially for our parents. Although my Dad got stroke several months after the trip, we did have good time playing and chatting together. Thank GOD.

Light, breezy filler featuring a push your luck race to collect sets of cards... Plays quickly, which is good since it lacks much thought. It's more a social exercise than a game, but it's still enjoyable -- especially when everyone hums some Carnival or Circus music when churning cards!

The scoring seems a bit too complicated for a filler game.  Don't really care for the push your luck element.  Would not miss it if I never played it again.

I've only played a handful of times, and I can see myself playing more...but once people catch on to what the optimal moves are, it all comes down to who's the luckiest, I think.  We'll see if this pans out.

RATING: 7
An excellent push your luck game. Extremely easy to explain and quick to play. Luck can get the better of you no matter what you do but you still find that you have at least 1 important decision to take every turn. The way scoring works at the end also means that you have several ways to play i.e go for Trios or hold on to the cards with the risk of losing them or points not counting for some cars. 

There's also interaction in the sense that you need to pay attention to what everyone else is taking to avoid getting your cards picked by them or letting them have cards which will benefit them. Also of course stealing cards from people you know have what you need.

I have the Grail games edition and i love the artwork.

(The rating of 5 is for the new version, which I find to have usability issues. I rate the gameplay a 6.5)

A cute and ultra-simple card game of set collection and pushing your luck. Easy to play, easy to teach, and over in about 15-20 minutes. This is a great filler.

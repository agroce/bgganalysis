I like the combining of Minor companies to public ones and that the Russian state acts as a clock to play against, which will also eat up anything unprofitable, adds a new spin to the game to try and profit as much as possible from minors while leaving shells for the government, very interesting, would like to play more.

It fell out of regular play as the game seemed decided once a 4 is bought, and the hard core players know the opening sequence very well which is where the game is contested. Imagine it is a fine game in that respect but not one I care to master at this time.

My first 18xx game, played with 3 players - first play for all of us, though the other two had played 18xx games before.  I really enjoyed it, even though I generally don't prefer stock-based games.  Very long game, though I barely noticed the first five hours go by (which says something positive for the game).  Would play again, though the game length is fairly prohibitive for me.

Rated 7 instead of higher, even though it's a great game, largely because it's not [i]my[/i] type of game.

EDIT:  Years and many 18xx games later, I would probably rate this higher (an 8 or 9) if I were to play it again.  It *is* my type of game and I love that type.

A very interesting varient of the 18xx theme, it is more of an empire building game than the other 18xx series which are more of a cut-throat game. The stock manulipation is lessen in this title than the others. Pay attention to the 4-trains came out rule, as we did screw it up in the first time and end up with most of the player's long term plan down the drain in our first playing. But I do like the design.

18OE is great as well.

My primary experience with 18xx are games with a little less 'bite' to them in terms of trashing your opponent's stock, etc.

RATING: 9
Rating based upon one play.  A kinder gentler 18XX game.  Unfortunately what I enjoy most about the 18XX games is that they are neither kind nor gentle.  A good intro to 18xx, but there still seems to be a ton of stuff to keep track of.  A beautiful game with high quality components.

The game ended up being a train race, and slowed down a lot towards the end as everyone tried to optimize their moves.  (Typical 18xx).  The race for the 3's is very important.  If you lose that race you can be out of the game.

Plays well with 4.  5 may be a to many people for this as it can be very long with that number of people.

This is an incredible gaming experience.  For fans of 18xx this is a must play!

Update: I have to slightly down grade this for the tame stock market.  When the director of a company sells stock the price moves down.  Not so for another player selling!  We played it wrong in the past and might continue to play it with the more aggressive variant, otherwise it's too tame.

Four playings, variously with 3 or 4 players.  Seems to sort of combine some of 1870 (the runs and endgame in particular) and 18EU (major formation and psuedo red-to-red with Ektarina-Moscow).  Endgame rules are quite different.  Much more train shenanigans than most 18xx games I've played, but almost completely lacking in stock manipulation (at least in the games I played).  The feel of the game seems to shift suddenly and unexpectedly - one round there's no money in the game, or runs are free and easy, the next everyone is awash in cash or the runs are constricted.  Tends towards the long end of the scale.

Start running a company as soon as the Presidents share is issued. Hmmm - interesting!

Well, I finally played this and enjoyed it. This is not a game of stock market manipulation, which generally is the side of 18xx that I prefer, but instead is a route building, company manipulation, engine optimisation game. 

The vast number of minors, the opportunity to time mergers, the acceleration of the train rush once the RSR gets going and so on builds the game up to a clever finish. You never seem to get the opportunity to run the same route with the same trains more than a couple of times before something rusts!

RATING: 8
I think this could work as an intro to 18xx - although the length could be a problem.

Lots here I like, especially the early game with the minors. Stock market isn't as interesting as I'd like, with very little activity - and the end game is a bit of a let down, but that aside I like the Russian State Railway mechanic of accelerating the trains.

All in all a solid 8. Rather play 1830 or 18Mex - but this or 1856 would be the next choice.

After 3 plays, I still don't have much to say about it.  It is a solid, but uninspiring game with minors and a public railroad.  The minors growing up is mildly more interesting than 18EU and I don't think the late game is as fiddly.  The state railroad serves solely as a game clock.  A good game and one I'm happy to play, but not one I'm ever excited about it.

RATING: 6.5
Rating based on one play with one relatively novice 18xx player, one experienced 18xx player, and one total 1861 shark.  Considerably heavier and more complex than any other 18xx game I've played, so while I appreciated the excellent design, I didn't exactly have fun while playing.  Would like to try it again soon before I forget how to play, but since I don't get 18xx games to the table very often, not sure I'll play it often enough to overcome the learning curve.

RATING: 8
Still quite fond of this one. It delivers some of the niffty '41 concepts without the
same overhead, and there is some interesting maneuver around the mergers
in relation to the train pace.

A lot of folk I respect are unimpressed by it, but after a couple of plays it has
my interest, and may remain in my middle tier choices. There are a lot of decisions,
but none of them are quite as dramatic in effect as I'm used to. It's more a game of tinkering to optimize, and planning for the best trains, rather than trying to crush your
opponents with the onslaught of trains.

RATING: 8
Played several times now with four and with five and I'm quite impressed. This 18xx feels like a combination of 1870 and 2038 and then simplified and streamlined into a package that plays in a lot less time than either of those great games. Lots of minor companies at the start means everyone has things to do. The private companies aren't overly powerful or unbalancing and players more than likely will not be hosed in the opening auction. The ability to skip stations is pretty powerful as nobody likes 10 stops, and pretty much every company can hit Moscow eventually.  But whether you combine minor companies via a merger or launch them as a major on their own or just say to heck with it and let the Russian national have em will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of the game.  The fact that you cannot go bankrupt and that you will get some compensation if you end up losing a company means this game is fine for 18xx beginners even with all the merger possibilities because, honestly, all the minors are worth buying even if you end up losing them because you will make money.  Overall, I think we'll be playing and exploring this title a lot more, and my rating could go up.  Ordered mine from Heron games when I found out they got the remaining stock 5/11/2010

RATING: 5
Kind of boring 18xx with an unbelievably long first act and a comatose stock market. Components are great. Art is solid. Map is nicely designed with helpful rule reminders in all the right places.  A common complaint levied against Caylus is that its designer just took bits and pieces from a big handful of Euros and tossed them in a blender.  I felt that way about this title.

Minor companies: Fine, and I suspect a little deeper than we gave them credit for.  Both they and you can make money fairly quickly in the early game, so holding off a little on mergers can not only put money in your pocket, but also plump up their pockets for a good position come merge-time.  The biggest problem with the monors is that they're kind of boring.  They're easy to run, and so the only good choices are how to bid for them and what to try to merge with what.

Stuff I have no idea what it is doing in the game: Loans are a complete waste of everyone's time.  There's a very little bit of early work minors might need to do to ensure they don't go belly-up, but we're talking 20 minutes of bookkeeping for about 3 minutes of interesting decision time.  Half-dividends I've never been a fan of, and they're useless here, too.  They reward (or rather, don't punish) players for sloppy planning, and don't even save any time since they add an additional option to what's already a challenging choice.  The RSR is a lame duck that will buy 1-2 trains during the game, 'speeding things along' at the cost of having to operate yet another company each OR. The 'threat' of getting folded into the RSR isn't much of one, considering the very generous bailout rules.  Rules for placing station markers are silly. Nobody used villages until they had a too-big train, and then it became $1/share microoptimization garbage.  Why are towns in the game?

This game is not a stock market game to the point where I'm not sure why there's a stock market in the game.  The move up the market is glacial yet perfectly consistent: companies make so much money due to the very generous capitalization situation that withholding is going to be rare. Companies almost never move down on the market.  Not interesting.The good news is that the track game is really fun, and the very mild train rush gives directors plenty of time to pull off fun train and cash shenanigans.

I really enjoy 18xx in general.

This game has fabulous production values. I like the idea of the nationalization.  The minor companies opportunity to merge or grown up into publics is the biggest place for thoughtful decision-making.

There is much less in the way of stock market shenanigans here than in 1830. It feels to me more like an offspring of the 1829 line.

I'd like to play more. Its not easy to get these games on the table, but I hope to get more playings in.

I like everything about the minor companies, but overall this is too fluffy for my tastes. The stockmarket is too static, players can't go bankrupt. (This game is not in the same branch as 1830). The game is a bit long for what it accomplishes, and the (optional) end game trains are rediculous. Gorgeous components for an 18xx.

Game features immediate partial floating.

[b]Pros[/b]
The minor companies and the relevant merger rounds are fantastic.
The majors are completely interchangeable.
[b]Cons[/b]
The train rush is too slow and the national railroad prevents players from going bankrupt.
Each sale of stock may only decrease a company's value once per batch sale.
The game features half-dividends.

This games feels substantially different to other games in the 18xx series that I have played. The emphasis in on the running of the railways rather than shafting others on the stock market.

The introduction of Minor Companies also makes a substantial change to the feel of the game.

As with all 18xx games, the big downside is the amount of time it takes to play the game.

[11 Apr 2017] - 9.5 (1 plays @ 3 players)
Wow, this was an enjoyable game! In terms of 18xx games, it seems like a great fit for new players or players who haven't explored everything in '61. Players start minor companies that get to operate quickly and produce cash. Incremental capitalization existed so the burden to getting into operating is low. There are loans to take out so companies really can operate quickly. Best of all, the Russian State will pay you cash for companies that fail for not having trains or running out of money; new players don't need to worry about going bankrupt. 

In our game this saved me when I took a gamble on trying to ride out the train rush, hoping my minors would get to operate. It didn't work and when the 2s rusted, I found 4 of my minors without a train. Good news is that I got paid out for running good companies and was then able to use that cash to take a nice sized stake in a major that was also being run good. This fueled my cash supplies and let me keep investing in the other majors as well as starting a well run major of my own. I ended up winning but could see how the rules took a lot of planning out of the picture and got me into the flow of 18xx instead. 

The one concern that keeps it from a "10" rating is whether the routes and play is fairly scripted. The city placement on the map suggests that you really only build east from Moscow and most of the N/S routes are on the western edge of the board. The end game also depends on the Russian State getting started so that might get tiring to some as well.

This is a great game. In the 18xx genre this is the second or third best game to pick. The reason for that is that also in the late game significant decisions have to be made and the game can yet be lost by poor late game decisions. This game focusses more or company management.

RATING: 6
18XX games are a lot of fun, but I'm not really a fan of this one.  My favorite thing about these games is the crazy stock market action.  Really, this game doesn't even need a stock market track.  In our 8 hour game, not a single share was ever sold to the bank.  And the only time the share price falls is when the president sells.  That doesn't make sense thematically + it hurt gameplay IMO.

The challenge of 1861 seems to be trying to judge the precise moment to turn your minors into publics.  Minors make good money for the player, while publics make a lot of money for the company.  Convert too early and you are broke.  Too late and you risk having your minor nationalized.  But even if your company is nationalized, you still get paid for it. Bankruptcy is not really possible.  On the plus side, 1861 offers some good strategy in terms of track/tile laying.  Unfortunately, I think it is just too cumbersome to recommend based on that positive.

An 18xx game set in Russia. The Russian State Railroad (RSR) offers very generous nationalization terms, being willing to pay current market price for any company it absorbs. As such, drooping companies into the RSR isn't very painful and can in fact be the best choice.

The game starts with only minor companies available. Managing your minor companies properly involves deciding which will buy additional trains, which will merge or upgrade to a major, and which will go into the RSR. The rhythm of this part of the game is relatively slow, but the pace picks up *fast* once the 4 trains hit.

A relatively long game. The stock market is important to manage, but doesn't generally have any wild swings. Dumping, while possible and still annoying, isn't as devastating as it can be in other games where if a company can't buy a train, the president is forced to pay for it.

Not supported by lemmi. Stock market mostly static.

1861 is, as far as 18XX games go, a breezy affair. It's lighter fare in the genre and I have taken to describe it via the analogy 1817 is to Bridge as 1861 is to Spades. I don't mean this analogy in a negative way of course but it raises the question: if 1817 is to Bridge and 1861 is to Spades, what's analogous to an 18XX-Euchre? The world may never know.

Personal: my favourite 18XX so far. The Stock market does not move as in 1830 but you should keep an eye on it. As Companies can take loans it is hard that you come with a Company with no future. With the minor Companies, the merge and the Russian Railroad you have many more options each turn

Got exactly what I was looking for in an 18xx game: simple stock market, interesting tile lays, many kinds of companies that evolve during the game and an endgame that is set by specific events in the game, not by money. Our first game of 5.5h didn't feel long at all except during the two last rounds before the 8-train was bought to trigger the end. It did feel like the 6 was the poisoned train this time because no-one wanted to buy it, because we didn't want to lose our 3-trains. In the end it was bought by a new company that had to get the 6 in order to reach Moscow & St. Petersburg. It felt like the best possible runs came from Ekaterinburg-Nishni Novgorod-Moscow-St.Petersburg-Poland, but that may have been just how our game played out.
Finally played a second F2F game (only 10 years after the first). Seemed like this game grew in spurts: lots of trains went out at the start. Then after a while (due to mergers) trains jumped from 3s to end of 5s and then finally when the last set of majors started, the RSR finally could buy something more than a 4 as well, so then we went from 6s to 8s in one set of ORs.

1861 is still my favourite 18xx title, even after 10 years and well over 100 plays. There are two main reasons for this:
a) the game is different every time, and
b) I can see where I went wrong, so I can improve my game next time.

So why not give it a 10? The game does have two minor flaws:
a) sometimes the game is decided at the purchase of the first 4-train (i.e. halfway through), and
b) although route-building is important, the financial aspects of the game dominate.

A rather bland 18xx, all the way from the flavourless Private Companies to identical Minors and Majors, played on a map where the towns don't matter. As in 1856 there are loans and a Government Railway to ease your pain when the game turns against you, but my main complaint is that the whole experience seems so ridiculously fair and balanced that it almost doesn't matter what you do, your score will be very close to everyone else's anyway. The same designer's 1812 is a better incarnation of this system, being shorter and more flavourful.

I am an avid fan of 18XX games and this is the worst 18XX game I have ever playd (I own about 10), I am disappointed with the game.

As my colleagues players have given the game such high marks, my first impression was that I might have read all of the rules wrong. However when rereading the rules and my experience with other 18 XX games I doubt this conclusion.

To be fair the board and pieces are probably the best I have seen for a 18XX game, this was the main reason I bought the game and so the game make a nice addition to my collection.

The game play was in my opinion heavily flawed and broken. And a lot of stuff in the game is really pointless, for example:

The game provides a whole lot of interesting difficult green and brown track types. As the game play fast at a certain point goes so extremely. you really don%u2019t need them, we only used the city upgrades.

What is the point of the Russian state railway? It only has historic value and no game play value what so ever and can be done without.

Why so many state loan markers, only the minor companies use a couple.

Also the villages, during the whole game that I plaid no one went over them, because if I read the rules correctly you are allowed to skip them.

And the game play an the end is really  ridiculous, the main companies own so much money at a certain point, the game goes from phase 5 to 10 in two operation rounds.

Because the pieces are so nice I am going to try and change the rules, to more of a 1835 style. Perhaps this gives a better play experience.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing.

We called the game early since one guy was pretty ahead and some other people showed up, so I don't have the fullest picture of this game, but I got a feel. I can definitely see the connection between this and 1867, though it's been long enough since I played that that I can't really say which I liked better. I can see the appeal of having two distinct sets of minors that come out one after the other, but I can also see the appeal of just letting them all go at once. And I can also see the appeal of the national company being more or less abstracted, but I didn't see enough of this game to see what kinds of stuff can happen with an actual national company and I don't remember 67 well enough to remember how the abstract one worked. I'd really like to get another play of this and also replay 67 at some point.

Currently unplayed, but I love what I've found in the box and the rulebook.  The game is beautifully produced, and the rules look very interesting.  I found it for $85 at a FLGS, and combined with the unlikelyhood of a reprint any time soon, I had to pick it up.

16 minor companies, 8 publics, the Russian juggernaut, and the typical array of private (annuity) companies.

No stock trashing, except by the hand of the current director.  Non-director sales of public shares don't drop the share price.  Publics float at 20%, and all shares (including first-time sales) are made at current market value.  

I'm very much looking forward to trying out this version, at which time I'll update this comment with more info.

After the 1st play: It was longer than I expected, but I enjoyed it as much as I thought I would.  The board was not as cutthroat as I had anticipated (or maybe just not as much as I'm used to in other 18xx games).  There appears to be a lot of loot to run off with in the form of defaulted loans, and that's something that I definitely want to explore more.  This first game was also good to gain a vague sense of how the minors might merge.

---
2nd game: I tried to pump up a company with 5 loans and transfer the cash to my "real" company.  All I really succeeded with is wasting a lot of time shuffling trains.  The rush through the 3-trains caught me by surprise.  When the first one is purchased, it opens up the 2nd half of the minors, and these things can chew up 3-trains in a hurry.  I'm still enjoying this game, and looking forward to trying it again.

After many different games 1861 was my first 18xx victory so I have a fondness for this one. Different to a lot of 18xx games I've experienced because the largest city in the game is pretty much the centre of the map. Also companies are usually flush with cash without withholding unlike a lot of others
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
1861, or at least 6p 1861, is too static for me after most of the minors are gone and the big mergers completed.

Because there's no stock trashing (except by the president) and virtually no chance of bankruptcy thanks to the Russian State Rail always being willing to nationalize a failing company, amassing wealth comes with little risk. Which turns the game into a giant economic snowball game. I like such games in general, but they need to be quicker in resolution than an 18xx if they're going to work for me.

Before I pass final judgment on 1861 I'd like to play it again with a smaller player count; I hate to generalize based on the 6p game since 6p 18xx tends to be an edge case. But I won't really be seeking out another opportunity when there are several other 18xx games out there I like more.

RATING: 4
Just as they say, this is an 18xx of managing a portfolio and operating strong companies (laying track wisely). There's almost no damage outside of some track maneuvering. I really enjoyed my first play of this, but only because of the hilarious context - big group of friends deciding to stay up all night on a whim. I'm not sure I can see investing more time in this game. Given that's everyone is just slowly amassing wealth, I think it takes way too long. Rating is tentative. 

Update: I've had a chance to sleep on my impressions of this game, and there's just not much here for me. Scandalous though it may be, I'd describe this 18xx game as innocuous. Almost bland. Sure, it's nice to see such a wide array of small companies. The mergers are sort of interesting in that they involve a bit of explicit negotiation, but they're such blips in this time-sink of a game. They suffer in comparison to the mergers in Indonesia, almost to the point where it's a silly comparison. 

All you do in this game is take little companies and start building an income from your stock portfolio. The companies get bigger. Trains run longer routes. Track gets more convoluted. More money floats around. Outside of the theme (which is awfully generic, as in most train games), where is the attraction? Sure, you get to feel like you're building something up, but it takes forever and it's not particularly interesting along the way. 1861 is not a bad game, but it is one of those games where it's almost impossible for me to see the attraction it holds for the fans. The one idea in here I liked was the weird endgame trains companies can buy. Honestly, I feel like these games need this kind of shake-up times ten.

From what I can tell, a very different game than most 18xx games. Very operations/route building-centric.  Stock values just a mirror of performance rather than something to be fiddled with by the players.

All in all, an enjoyable, almost relaxing game.  Great for a lazy afternoon.  Very approachable for new players, as bankruptcy/ stock trashing just doesn't happen.

Nice 18xx-variant with some interesting elements like the timing decision for the merger/conversion of the minor companies, the nationalisation treat/opportunity into the Russian Railway and the endgame being triggered by the selling of the first 8-train. Good game for beginners, as you can't go bancrupt and the stockmarket is rather friendly.

I am not even sure that this can properly be called an 18xx game, since there is so little emphasis on stocks, the stock market, and stock manipulation that you can almost forget they're in the game.  

1861 is an almost purely operational affair -- track building, money management management, train manipulation, token drops and that's about it.  Really, in fact, the game opens with a langurous process of running "minor railroads" that have no stock certificates and always pay half their run value to the owner and half into their own coffers.  I sort of liked these little things, as it's a quick way to add a varied setup to the game, and the decisions of if and when to merge them and when to make them go public were diverting enough, but there are SIXTEEN of these things!  And so you have at least a third of the game gone by before a single certificate is issued!

And then when you get into the main game, you find that there is no stock trashing.  Stocks only move downward on the chart when the company president sells them.  Anyone else sells and they're unaffected.  It's easy to keep them from moving backward since you can do half-dividends, and there are no brown or yellow regions on the chart to allow for the interesting strategies of purposefully withholding a company's dividends to use it as a feeder for other company's trains.

All that was left for me of interest in this game was managing trains and skirting the train rush.  (I do not find track-building or token drops an interesting aspect of 18xx.)  That was fun enough for awhile but this one overstayed its welcome even more markedly than most 18xx do with me.

1861 is probably the most beloved title in the local 18xx group I play with, and I asked one of the guys why he likes it. "It's a civil game," he said, one you could enjoy over a cup of tea.  In other words, a relaxing break from the aggression and cut-throat play of 1830 and the like.  I should have known better than to try this.

On a positive note, this has the nicest components of any 18xx I've played.

Really enjoying the minor companies and being able to merge or convert them. Very different from 1830-like games in that you cannot go bankrupt and the soft nationalization option seems to often be the right choice (rather than hurting your other companies to get all with trains, or merging all bad minors with others). So far, it seems to offer plenty of decisions and high value runs (implying the necessity to have not just solid but rather strong companies with two good trains). The loans are just enough to tide you over some shortages and seems to make sense to set up situations where you take 2 or 5 loans to grab a new train.

1841 is one of my favorite 18xx games so when I read that the game designer based much of his design for 1861 off of 1841 that was a real selling point for me.  I really like the 16 minor companies and how they eventually merge or convert into a public company.  I didn't realise the RSR would play as big a role in buying trains as it did, but our first game was probably atypical as seven minors were trainless when the 4 train was purchased.

I don't know whether it's simply the complexity of train-juggling for three or four companies that one has to do in the early stages of this one, or the doubt about what to do with my minor companies, but I find 1861 to be far more baffling than some other titles in the genre.  It's still fun to play, but I have yet to get to phase 4 and not have the sense that I'm already getting crushed.  

Update (Apr 08): A couple more plays and some discussion with other players has straightened a few things out, and this has made games more enjoyable.  I think I'm even starting to get the hang of things.  If anything, now I'm worried that this means that the game isn't as deep as some of the others; we'll see how I feel after another half-dozen plays.

Update (Aug 08): Browsing other user comments ... I must agree that the stock market is largely dead.  I don't think it could be easily removed due to the major company formation rules, but don't expect the roller-coaster ride that many of the other 18xx provide here.  As far as I can tell, this is principally a game about finance, company operation, and route planning, in that order.  I'd say that there's a side of portfolio management, but in general there isn't a lot of floating stock in the games that I've played... perhaps portfolio management for garnish (update Oct 09: there is an interplay between portfolio management and finance, in that sometimes you can't buy the shares you'd otherwise buy because you need to buy up to 50% or so of your own company).

As far as I can tell, the gameplay is pretty much done once the first six gets bought.  There's a little bit of wriggling around as to who can actually use the eight and who can use 2+2s and 5+5Es, and I cannot say that it's not important, but the bulk of the game happens early.

Update (Oct 09): It's also worth mentioning that there are significant timing elements to the game, although how much control one has over them is questionable.  A recent game saw me with an R-O with 2x 2T that I assumed wasn't going to get to run in OR 3-1 due to the imminent arrival of the 4T.  Instead, the prospective buyer waited to be able to keep a company other than M-B, and the 4T didn't show up until I bought it in OR 4-1.  For that and other reasons, I went on to win handily; I have little doubt that if the R-O had folded I was going to be bringing up the rear for the rest of the game.

(old material): I cannot fathom a game of this where no minors go into the RSR.  I can imagine that it happens, for the same reason that there are games of 1856 where the CGR doesn't form.  Consider, however: due to the government buyout rules, it seems incorrect to think of minors going to the government as a punishment for mismanagement.  In many cases it can be a reward for judiciously trimming away deadwood.

Liked it.  It is a railroad dev game in the 18xx lineup, and it (probably over-) simplifies the stock market.  You still have plenty of options on how to form corporations and the manipulation of minor companies makes for interesting strategy decisions.  I would have to say this is more an engineers version of 18xx as opposed to a portfolio management game but I like it very much.

Although the stock market is a bit weak, the merger rules are excellent, and make for many different paths you can take when playing this game.

To accommodate a more active stock market we usually play with share price drops regardless of who's making the sale.

Have tried using 1860’s 1-4 "jump"-rule (Dividend Yield approach), and it works fine here as well and allows for a share price trashed company with decent earnings to recover easily.

RATING: 6
April 2012: First game, five players, all experienced with the 18xx system, in particular 1841.

This feels like a smorgasbord 18xx game with its balls cut off -- a lot of different features I recognize in other 18xx games, but with an extremely tame stock market and overly generous capitalization rules.

I do like how all players are able to own two corporations right at the start of the game; I like 18xx games with a lot of corporations; it's fun to shift assets from one corporation to another. There are 16 minor corporations available, which behave as 1-share corporations that always pay out split dividends. I liked how 1861 does this over 18EU because the minors behaved as regular corporations without any tile laying restrictions (in 18EU, minors cannot upgrade tiles). Because the minors in 1861 are quite profitable, one significant decision players must face is when to merge or convert minors into public corporations. 

I agree with many of the BGG comments that this game is innocuous and bland, which is fine -- if the game hadn't lasted 6 hours. However, I have a good 18xx gaming group, so that itself made the game fun.

So this game is stuck in an uncomfortable middle ground: Tame enough for beginners but way too long, or rather, too bland for experienced 18xx gamers who want to play a 4+ hour 18xx game. I would suggest 18EU over 1861 if you want a lighter 18xx game that features a lot of corporations that merge together simply because it's shorter.

This is a game that I've owned twice.  I let it go the first time because there seemed to be a fair number of 18xx "experts" who didn't care for the way it played.  As I became a little more experienced on my own, these opinions seemed to hold less weight.  I care less for the stock market shenanigans than many of these folk do.  Thus, to me, the game is still interesting.  In addition, it was for me the first where the predominate means of starting companies was by combining minor companies.  I like the difference in this and many of the others out there and will happily play it again.  [03/13/2011]

Friendlier game than most other 18XX since there is no bankruptcy, instead the russian national railroad just buys the shares from players when a small company ends up with no train after the 4, 6, and 8 trains are bought.  The game itself doesn't have a lot of variation since the   companies always start in the same locations and the track generally ends up looking about the same since players always want to run the same routes every game.

I do think this is a fine introductory 18XX game and is worthy of a few plays for any 18XX enthusiast, but after playing it a several times my interest in playing it again is fairly low.  I'll play it for sure, but I'd never  vote for it as a first or second choice.

Compared to the other games in the 18xx series that I've played, this has a heavy focus on track building while the stock market remains pretty static.  The first part of the game everyone is pretty poor and there are no stocks to be had.  As opposed to other 18xx systems spending all your cash isn't always a good thing as there can be stock rounds from mergers in the middle of ORs.  This leads to some engaging choices in money management.

I wasn't sure how I felt about the minor companies at first, but I soon found them compelling as you tried to set them up for proper mergers or conversions.  This leads to a variable set-up which should allow for a significantly different game every time.  That said it certainly feels like you are in the "set-up phase".

The train rush wasn't as crazy here, but everyone was so poor that the threat of the Russian company added a sense of impending doom.  I think it would be tough to accidentally get sucked into the Russian Rails, but it does insure that you are on top of your game, and allows for some fun ways to liquidate companies that other players are heavily invested in.

Even with all the other stuff going on here with the towns nearly pointless, the lack of mobility on the stock market and the level of friction to get into the stock buying part of the game I felt that there is a bit of the game that is missing.  That isn't to say that I didn't really enjoy it, but there is a certain dynamicism that is lacking compared to 1856 or 1860.  Contrary to this though, I quite liked the map. I will gladly play this again with someone that knows why on earth other people like this.

UPDATE: I WON'T PLAY THIS AGAIN UNTIL THERE AREN'T BEGINNER RULES FOR THE STOCK MARKET.

I think there is less to this game than to some other 18xx.  But the decisions that are there I find really interesting.  The minors are really fun and I love the ability to either grow up or to merge and I love all the jostling for the trains around the rusting of the 2's.  I think the game is pretty much decided at that point.  The person who has managed the conversion to majors the best and who has the most stocks will probably go on to win.  The stock market isn't that exciting, there isn't really a way to negatively affect other people's fortunes and the end of the game just sort of plays it self out. There's a bit more jostling around getting a permanent train but that's about it.  When you can run a company with 2 shares and the rest are in the company, all the companies were flush with cash. Luckily I like all things 18xx and track development and token placement is fun.  2010/06/06

A cut above the other 18xx games.  The early game is quite fun, the end game is somewhat repetative, but I still like it.  Be sure to set aside enough time for this monster.  I also take issue with some of the cities having communist names since it is supposed to be set in 1861!

The opening is fairly variable due to the way the minors start and develop into publics, which is all good. However, the midgame tends to drag quite a bit, and track development in the midgame and later tends to follow some predictable patterns. Consequently, I haven't had much desire to play it the last few years.

Played 1 3-player game. I felt like the game was repeatedly teasing us. Here were more than a dozen minor companies, all set to merge and convert in lots of interesting ways. In fact, mergers were quite humdrum, and no one merged with their competitor. Nothing succombed to the RSR, which itself did nothing interesting. Nothing remotely interesting went on in the stock market. No companies changed ownership. The only two insolvencies happened in the last round. The only interesting things going on in the game were building track, which was pretty neat, deciding when to buy trains, which was only interesting a few times, and deciding which stock to buy, which was sort of a crap-shoot as all of the companies were gaining in value.

Great 18xx game of which I've only played 2 (2038 being the other).  There are 3 type of companies, privates, minors and publics.  You bid on the director's shares of the privates and the minors. The majors are formed by IPO, Mergers and/or Start ups.  Companies buy track and trains.  Players buy shares.  Companies stock goes up as they deliver and payout, go down if they don't pay out.  Trains rust as new models are bought.  The goal is to have the most money.  Don't attempt this game without a spreadsheet or your head might explode :).  All in all a great game but somewhat on the longish side.

It was good. More gentle than 1856. However, after this game, I decided that while I do enjoy train games, I don't really want to play a train game that will last 5+ hours. German politics aside, 5 hours is a long time for a game :)

(NEWBIE to 18xx comments.  After 1 5p game, my 2nd 18xx game ever with 18AL being the first)  It was indeed beginner friendly - no Bankruptcy, gentle stock market, limited blocking.  It was very difficult to tell who the leader was.  The minor companies were interesting.

Not my favorite. Too much "run a railroad well" for me. Yawn of a stock market.

Merge minor companies to major companies. Russian State Railways will collect trainless companies. Reasonably quick, three player game in four hours.

A mediocre 18xx game with a totally crippled stock system. 

The map is functionally skewed to be best played with 3 players. Additional players just means those who get shut out of Moscow are almost guaranteed to lose.

I'm looking for a 2.edition-copy of 1861.

Really really like this one, bidding on where to place companies, forming the Russian national, the only thing that puts Canada above this one is that it plays just a little quicker.

Certainly the most gentler 18xx games I've tried thus far.  The merger system is an interesting idea and seems to be where a lot of the strategy is focused.  Especially knowing when to take the plunge to either get ahead of or to force the train rusted.  However, I'm very ambivalent on the idea of the minor companies.  They not only neutered the stock market (making the earlier stock round a complete joke), which doesn't come into play until half-way through, but they also cut down the interaction significantly.  Certain ones such as the Nikolai you can't even build tracks until you can upgrade tiles, so all the owner can do is performing the same run turn after turn.

1861 is a solid game for sure, but what I love most about the 18xx series is the stocks and how you can manipulate the market through buying and selling, which in turn affect the rise and demise of companies.  1861 has none of that.  I would even go as far to say that the gameplay felt very solitaire-like for the most part because besides the track building, all you do is run the companies you started with.  What other people do really have little impact in your decisions.

I enjoyed my playing of 1861, but I don't think it lived up to my expectation.

Update #1: Ended up playing this again just a week after.  Took control of two different minors this time to an unimpressive dead last.  It seemed that in comparison to the other 18xx I've tried thus far getting the right trains at the right time is even more important in 1861, probably due to how many companies operate throughout the game.  I'm still not too keen on the reduced role of the stock market even though someone managed to steal control of a major line from another player.  It's a good game for sure, but for the most part it felt like the same race to profit off of the Moscow-Ekaterinburg connection.  I'd probably buy a copy if it's ever reprinted, but certainly does not worth the premium price that people are asking for right now.

Un juego y un sistema absolutamente maravillosos si uno está dispuesto a jugar durante unas 8 horas, y quiere darle bien al coco.

I just can't seem to get into railroading in Russia.  Call me a westernophile...

Quite fun game actually. Building 3d bucket pyramid and then playing trick to destroy opponents' ones. Requires planning how to place buckets, altought there is a lot room for luck.

RATING: 7
A new look for the classic game, using actual physics instead of the simulated kind!  The art is a little baffling and the suits don't read well, but still a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game that mixes a simple dexterity element to a somewhat standard trick taking game. The key though is the rule that says that if a person misses his chance to draw a card then he can't anymore. This produces a game where you have to pay attention, try to distract your opponents or prepare to take your turn fast before someone notices he has not drawn a card, which is hilarious. 
Downside is the you can accidentally knock your buckets down in the tension or rush to grab your 'forgotten' card and might not remember how you set it up before, which is important for the game. Overall, a very innovative design which is strategic, fun and hilarious, all at the same time.

The buckets are all a bit pointless I thought maybe there could be a strategy of getting the buckets out but the same amount fall no matter what which makes the mechanic pointless

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
There are some rule tweaks on this one, but the game pretty much felt the same as the previous version.  The 3d buckets are really neat, and definitely make the game more fun to play.  Both version have terrible art on the cards, so but oh well.

Build a pyramid with 10 buckets of 5 different colours. Every player starts with 10 coloured cards, each with a specific value. One player opens, the next player has to follow with the same colour and a higher value (may be multiple cards, where a 1 of the same colour can be combined with a value of any colour). The player who can't overbid, has to tick away a cup of the corresponding colour. Every cup that falls as a consequence of this action is removed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A pretty ridiculous ladder climbing card game where scoring is handled by poking colored plastic buckets out of a pyramid of said buckets.   Zany, so the Japanese art/theme fits...  I guess.   It's fast, funny, painless, but not something that people would want to play too often.

Essayé à Essen 2016
On construit une pyramide de petits seaux colorés. Chaque tour, le premier joueur pose des cartes d'une couleur donnée (correspondant aux seaux). Les joueurs suivants doivent surenchérir avec des cartes de la même couleur. Celui qui ne peut pas doit faire gicler un seau de sa pyramide (et on retire du jeu tout les seaux qui se pètent la gueule). Il faut, à la fin de la partie être celui avec le plus de seaux encore là. Amusant mais pas inoubliable. Facile d'ajouter une règle à boire, par contre...

Bucket King is a simple, little card game.  I can't believe this was a game before without the buckets.  What a boring game that must have been.  However, you add in this dexterity element and strategy of how to stack your buckets, now you've got yourself a game!  I noticed that playing aggressively may not be the best way to go about it.  I found myself losing more and more buckets.  And once you're down to one, let's face it, it's over!  I really enjoyed this one.  Great stuff here.

Fun little card game, although 3D baskets won't bring anything new to old game. The new rules aren't as good as old 'Bucket King' has, so use the older one instead the new one.

RATING: 3
FIRST IMPRESSION:

If you didn't like the original Bucket King, this isn't going to change much for you. I do like the tactical feel of the plastic buckets and the image it presents. Cards are horrible for color blind people. There is one change to the rules in that whoever starts a round decides which direction the round goes...and there is an additional variant using the wild ones to add a number of a different color to represent a different suit.

RATING: 6.75
牌庫: 5色 1~8 X2
心得:
疊金字塔時盡量不同顏色分散
然後看狀況輸掉也沒關係(如果要出兩張以上才能不掉的話)
有出牌權時
盡量出上方的水桶色
或是小數字牌
剩下的就是抽牌運了
規則:
*一人先發10張牌
*2~4人以下一人3*5個桶子，5~6人一人2*5個桶子排成金字塔
*起始玩家出1~3張牌，補一張，後面的一定要跟顏色且比較大
*起始玩家決定出牌方向
*在輪到自己時出的牌跟自己上次出的牌加總比上家大即可
*變體出1時可以連帶出其他顏色的牌，且也會多補牌，最多一次出5張
*掉水桶的成為新的起始玩家
*2~4人有人掉光就結束5~6人要兩個掉光，剩水桶最多的獲勝

This is a very simple trick taker at heart, but with a pretty hilarious bidding system twist. After being dealt your hand of cards, you examine them and then you construct a pyramid of upside-down plastic buckets whose position reflects the strength of your hand (if you have a lot of [or high] green high cards, green buckets help form the base of your pyramid, if you have no purple cards you place the purple buckets at the top, etc). Whenever you lose a trick, you flick a bucket to remove it (along with any others that were using it as support). So there's an added dexterity component to the game. It's simple and hilarious.

RATING: 6.5
Played once with 3P. Beneath the riot of colours lies a barebones climbing game of careful hand management. Combining cards sets up the next player to take a hit, but also permanently reduces your hand size. There's even a bit of deduction thrown in, as the way a player's pyramid is arranged indicates which colours she is likely to be strong in.

That said, there's still a lot of luck involved in the cards drawn throughout, so it is still a lightweight card game. The dexterity element of flicking away buckets is rather superfluous unless you are terrifically clumsy, and the rule that you may not draw a replacement card if you forget to during your turn becomes rather grating after a while. But this was quite a pleasant surprise nonetheless as I had almost written this off as a totally random game.

A fun combination of cards and dexterity, with a little "take that" thrown in to make it even better. With very few rules it's easy to teach, and quick set-up allows for repeated plays in a short period of time. Fun for kids and even adults, a great family or party game. Just plain silly fun.

What happened to the nice filler that is known as [gameid=3141] (which i rate a 7.5)? Ugly graphics, image/color choices that made the game very hard to play for colorblind players, and low bucket number so that you have to play a reduced game if you want to play with 5 or 6 (as we always do). And a pseudo-dexterity element - no player ever failed to flick the right bucket; maybe you need to be more drunk to play this.

This was sadly not as much fun as I had hoped. It's a decent enough card game, but I think it would've been more fun to flick away opponents' buckets rather than your own. On top of that, the buckets are so sturdy and well made that they don't topple over all too easy.

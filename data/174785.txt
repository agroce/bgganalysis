RATING: 6
1 play / 4 players

LIKE: A civilization game with multiple paths to victory. I really liked the special god powers. The trading round and choosing who builds or attacks first were nice interesting choices. The rubber mat board was great, but very large.
DISLIKE: The war tension is not really my thing. Also war can be a losing strategy because one person can turtle and win as the other players attack each other. I didn't feel the resource variation added much strategy to the trading portion.

OVERALL: Very similar to Antike, but more complexity and resources. It's a solid game, but I'm not really a fan of the war tension in these types of games. I'd play this every once in a while, but not often. Someone mentioned a team variant, which I think would elevate this game.

RATING: 7
It's pretty well designed overall, but there were a few things I didn't really like about it.  There was significant down time and it was difficult/impossible to keep track of what everyone was up to (and what resources they had).  Also, the trading phase is not well designed.

All in all, a good game though.  4 victory conditions mean there is some room for creative play.

Played twice with the expansion at six players.

When I saw the review of this game, I knew I would like it but did not expect to like it so much. The game gives me that same feeling as a long wargame with nations that play differently from each other but yet games end quickly in 1.5 to 2hrs in comparison. The word to describe the gameplay is streamlined. The rules are easy to learn and the play is quick and to the point and yet decisions have strategic value. The multiple paths to victory also means that players have a way to catch up by doing a less popular victory path and increases replayability. This also shortens the game as people sooner or later can't stop everyone from winning at the same time. 

The only con of the game is the same as with most multiplayer war like games in that kingmaking can be an issue. 

In conclusion, I played it 2 games in a row and would not have minded to play it again straight after. Thumbs up for me and a game not to be missed.

Voilà un jeu qui regroupe à la foi commerce, politique et de la baston dans des règles simples mais qui demande tout de même d'activer nos neurones pour élaborer des stratégies gagnantes ou pas :p. Tout d'abord le jeu est beau et niveau matériels c'est correct sauf pour les paravents.
Sinon pour vraiment apprécier ce jeu je conseille fortement de faire des parties avec joueurs qui ont au moins à leurs actifs deux ou trois parties car il suffit d'un nouveau joueur et la partie sera complètement déséquilibrée.

RATING: 6.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I'm a big sucker for civilization games that include conflict. It might be my background with Latin and Ancient Greek, but there's something irresistible about this type of game for me. Mare Nostrum. however, never really caught my attention, probably because of the very bland artwork and weird color choices. I really don't like how the game looks. Still, when I got a chance to play it, I didn't say no.

I fairly enjoyed my one play of Mare Nostrum. I like the fact that there's multiple ways to win the game: you can win with military, with culture, with politics and so on. I know this is basically a staple of this style of games, but I enjoy it nonetheless every time. Furthermore, there's one aspect of this design that I find really fascinating: the turn order/structure. I think it's really cool that the player furthermost on the corresponding track gets to choose how that phase of the round plays out. I think it's thematic and it's also something quite unique, that I've never seen in any other game.

Another aspect that I really liked about Mare Nostrum is the presence of different buildings that you can construct to make your engine better and the Heroes/Wonders that give you special abilities.

At the same time though, I'm really not a fan of the resource management system. It's quite cool for the commerce aspect that it introduces, but at the same time this whole thing of collecting sets of different resources seems very off to me. It doesn't quite fit the rest of the design and it feels like a mechanism from another era of board gaming. Maybe I'm letting this aspect influence too much my enjoyment of the game, but I really really disliked it.

This weird concept, combined with the bland artwork and an uninspired combat resolution mechanism, makes Mare Nostrum only a modestly enjoyable game for me. This new edition still feels like a product of a different time in game design... it's not quite as bad as Fief: France 1429 (another Academy Games title that disappointed me), but it's still a bit outdated. It's such a wasted opportunity. They should have used the chance of the reprint to make the game-play more modern. It could have been a much better game!

It is a great civilization game. It is a streamlined version of a lot of complicated civ games with map, like Sid Meyer's Civ, it reminds of it a lot specially the various winning conditions. I enjoyed the game a lot and would play it more time.

Not a bad game but feels weak next to Cyclades. Not as much fun factor and pyramid finish feels anticlimactic. I had high hopes for the goods exchanging mechanic but found it to be tedious, but loved the tension that comes with order selection of leaders. I am afraid it will be always be shadowed by other better games in the genre that I would rather play. Also, I did not feel too comfortable with mixed mythological characters/wonders across civilisations as it just felt wrong.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
I was part of this KS desaster. If you were a US backer - all is fine and well. If you were a non-US-backer I will give you the reason for my rating: The KS is not delivered yet (Sept 16; original date was 11/15; US versions since 06/16). We don't know what we will get even if we backed the same KS.
Promo-Heroes: not enough printed, reprint done: still only half of the needed amount was printed.
Plastic buildings: partly damaged, not enough to replace
any other stretch goal or added stuff: only the exact amount was printed, if something is missing or damaged there is nothing to replace it.

Responsibility: Academy claims it is Asynchron who claims it is Academy. But at least - to cite AG: THEY learnt a lot while processing this KS.

Good to know that I backed for education and not in my absurd dreams to get a game or even to get a complete game.

I have backed a few games over the years and some of my worse experiences with KS was someone running away with the money or a guy with a lot of great ideas but an absolute lack of business managing skills (...what do you mean I need written contracts with production-companies).  This KS clearly made it in my TOP 3. The lack of response, the constant "but it isn't our KS / we are not responsible" and the complete ignoring of any non-US-backer - while the last in line, the German distributor gets all the fire - speaks for itself. KS-parts were sold thru AG shop before even the KS was completely delivered (buildings f. ex.) and now the rest is scraped together for the "dogs at the table". 

If you are an US backer - support them; if you are a non-US-backer stay far away from any KS this company makes. Just a suggestion.

This might actually be a 9, and will adjust upward if I play it again and still enjoy it as much.  I don't get to play a lot of these games, but this one seems very solid.  I love the tension between building military and infrastructure.  Balancing the various paths to victory is non-trivial, and I really appreciate that.

With all the extra components this game is something extra. It's really a nice game. They only down side this game have is the play time. On 5-6 players we never played under 3,5 hours. And the Pyramid win seems a bit too easy compared to other win conditions. A game for gamers, but not som much for beginners I think.

Very happy with this Kickstarter.  Not too heavy - actually pretty streamlined game with cool mechanics (track leaders, player trading, multiple paths to victory).  Rule book makes the game seem heavier than it actually is..  This is most definitely a keeper!  Couldn't be happier.  Now only if we can better keep Egypt in check.....

RATING: 6
7/1/16:  Similar to a lot of other civ building games.  My biggest complaint is that the trading makes up a significant amount of length of the game, and doesn't seem to have a significant impact.  It seems like it's only in there to differentiate it from other civ building games, it doesn't add that much.

One downside that is common to games like this is that you are really subject to the personalities of the players next to you.  In a 5 player game, I  started out sitting between the two most aggressive players, and suffered as a result.  It's not a perfectly balanced Euro, you need to be comfortable with that.  A portion of the game is out of your control, and it doesn't matter how well you play.  If one player makes an aggressive move too early, it ends up hurting both him, and the person whose territory they took a chunk out of.  One thing that the game does to mitigate this is to have standard starting positions for each player rather than a random setup on the board.  This keeps players from setting up next to each other, crowding one player, and giving another a lot of room to grow.  I'm looking at you Fief.

Overall, the aesthetics of the board are wonderful.  The graphics are very well done.  In general Academy games always does a good job with their graphics.

The kickstarter ceramic resource chips and plastic buildings are wonderful.  After playing with them, I'm not certain that I'd be satisfied owning the game without them.  I'm a big fan of poker chips, so any time you replace cards, cardboard or paper with chips, it's a big improvement.

5 players took 3.5 hours on first play.

I have not played the original Civilization game, so this should been taken with a huge grain of salt, but from the description of that game, I would say this is a suitable 'mini'-version that take only a few hours to play. Comes complete with trading, building and (albeit partial random) combat.

I biggest quibble is how the inclusion of mythological and historical figures with the lack of any mystical/magical powers make the theme feel inconsistent. I would prefered purely historical or mythological setting.

Only played 3 1/2 games so far, but enjoyed them very much. 1 explaining and learning game, abandoned due to time restraints, with Greece being close to the 4 city win. 2 4-player games, both won by me. One 4 city victory as the Romans, one pyramid victory as the Greeks. 1 2-player game won by me as the Romans by leadership. My players have to learn to better observe me than just build towards their own goals ;-)

Best of all, my players also liked it and it fits into our weekly game night timeframe of 2 1/2 hours.

Also this game feels somewhat similar to Quartermaster General for me. It gives you the feel of an epic game in a short timeframe with a very streamlined and easy to teach ruleset.

As an added bonus it is very visually appealing. I already ordered the building expansion that I skipped on during the Kickstarter. Then it will look even better.

RATING: 6
Fast playing light Civ game. +1 for aesthetics and component quality. Multiple paths to victory.

After a few plays I think the game is flawed. Playing with hidden goods usually leads to surprise Pyramid victory which is rather unsatisfying. Playing with open goods leads to group plotting to stop a win and the game drags, eventually ending unsatisfactorily as well. Between the two I think hidden information is the best way to play since it does end faster.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
Definitely not just another "dudes on a map" game, and there are some neat choices to make due to a wide range of win conditions.  4 player does feel a bit off since one side of the board does seem a little more open than the other, but hard to tell after so few plays.  I do think though it would be better at the 5p count.  I do think its a bit over hyped, but overall its a good game, with some really nice components.  Definitely interested in playing more, and trying out some of the other Nations / Factions (Whatever they are called) & Player count combinations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Kickstarter copy with all the extras.  Base game, Atlas Expansion, KS Exclusives, Upgraded Resource Chips, Large Scale Game Board Mat, 3D Building Upgrade, etc.

Great game.  Gives you that 4x satisfaction without super complex rules.  A couple play-throughs and you should be pretty set.  The base game, even without any extras is very good.  We played this way a few times before even adding in anything and I can easily say we would enjoy the base game as is just fine if I didn't have all the extras.

The subtleties of how the round plays out are interesting.  Who determines what order players go in and other such mechanics really impact game play on a fairly constant basis.  Make sure you read how rounds work carefully.  While it's simple it's a little different than other games.  For example, if you control a certain aspect of one of the rounds within a turn you don't just pick who takes their turn up front.... you pick someone to take their turn and when they are done you pick the next person.  So what one single player does on, say, their build phase might cause you to change your mind about who you want to build next, and the process gives you that control.

I think this is a little simpler than Game of Thrones, but an overall better game in the overall genre.  Similar to Game of Thrones it plays well enough with three people, but you're probably going to see the game play out the same too often unless you change up the starting cultures.

Plastic dudes on a map, but not too intricate. Concise rules and pretty deep play. Only the symbols on the map and how they influence each other takes a bit of study, but the rest is straightforward and quicly explained to beginners.
Clearly a format that seems popular now. "Risk" on steroids comes to mind. Variable player powers, euro-style balancing and four different winning conditions.

Played once and liked it. I can imagine rating this higher after more plays.

Pretty solid production. The visual style is a strange mix. The artwork on the box is intense; Deep black with desert colored graphics, but only the wonder cards have the same look. The rest is more standard fare. It's a pity that the player boards are so flimsy. Nice and recognizable player units.

Interesting mechanics. Seemingly claustrophobic in both the number of occupiable regions and the number of troops available per faction, designed that way to induce interaction.

Seemed a bit limiting in that capacity, though, as the individuals of the various starting leaders are better equipped to make the most of such a cramped decision space.

Might need to play more to get a better sense of the strengths of the factions I've not yet played as.

Firstly I must say this is an excellently designed game and there is nothing wrong with it. We played the Kickstarter version with map cloth and the Atlantis expansion which has amazing components. Overall the game has streamlined systems, not very complicated and is easy to learn. The reason I am only giving it is a 5 is through no fault of the game itself or the design, which is topclass, I just personally don't have the desire to want to wade thru this type of game experience. To elaborate: Although it looks open, the gameplay is actually quite linear and scripted. In most games the first couple of turns players just build up their economy ( buy markets/temples/camels), then turns 3 to 6 purchase a new hero/wonder each turn and a few military units, possibly engage in a few combats and then the game ends in about turn 7 to 9 once they have their 5th hero/wonder or someone gets lucky with the pyramids. Although there are a vast array of heroes and wonders  to build, which create the illusion of an exciting and varied Cycladesesque type of game, it doesn't change the actual experience as to how the game flows which is a bland meandearing formulaic explore, expand and exterminate derivative. Another feature of this kind of game is it doesn't allow enough interplayer combat and action due to its limited turn length and map logistics of being able to get around. If you are on one end, it is difficult to have any effects on players at the other end. If they are left alone and/or get better trades they will most likely win and there is nothing you can do about it, it all feels very claustrophobic and inhibiting. The game in fact plays more like a Euro optimiser than a true wargame, as although combat does carry substantial rewards, there is simply to little time to do anything in the turns. Combat also comes with a large punitive opportunity cost if unsuccessful or leaving yourself open to counter attack. In our  6 player game there were only 2 shortish combats in the entire game. Basically the game is a fairly slow, sterile, predictable and processionary affair with little combat or excitement while everyone trying to optimise their trades and waiting for someone else to attack in the hopes of an opportunistic chance to grab something afterwards. Overall the game does improve on some elements in the base game but essentially I personally am looking for a more dynamic, inter-active, action packed and less scripted sort of multi player combat game like Eclipse or a game more similar to this, Cyclades (also a shorter playing time ). Once again I am not criticising anything about this game, its just a personal choice if you prefer a game like as opposed to the other types on offer.

This is a Euro civilization game with retractable fangs. It doesn't have to resort to conflict but you tend to see it in spurts in this new edition.

It clocks in at a great two hours and feels pretty meaty and fulfilling. Really love the leader board for each resource type, really love the trade phase, and really love the way you can pillage and occupy territories. Also dig the heroes and asymmetry of starting nations. 

Overall this is a great game that will get played and provides for a very even and measured experience that is opened up with conflict and multiple paths to victory.

A very simple ruleset is set up for the players to interact and compete. There are threats everywhere and a lot of different paths to take. The winning conditions are interesting, but as competitive as the game is, it plays better without a track everything and bash the winner mentality. Plays fast, which is amazing for a game that has an epic feel. I loved it.

Just received via my Kickstarter campaign.  Been wanting to play this one for a long time.  

Components:  My initial impressions of the components so far is not very positive given the price paid and the special Kickstarter attention given to this release.  Many of the screens and player aids feel cheap.  My biggest complaint is the size of the playing board is small compared to the size of the box.  Being the centerpiece of the play, skimping on the size that could have been offered with this sized box.  Guess that is why they were trying to promote a jumbo board instead.  We'll see if this is a big issue during game play, but my assumption at this point is that it could have been better.

LI. Quick civilization building game? Must check +++
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The 5 & 6 player setup was a bit disappointing. It does not do anything better than many other games and it does some things worse. Trading part is always fun, but every player can check anyone in just one turn, and with limited number of units you can build, it becomes very "game"-y very quickly. Does not give you a war game sense at all.

However, the reason I rated it high is due to it's 2-player variant, where the game really shines. It's brutal, you feel in control and there are many things to do which you simply won't have time for. And then it ends in a culmination of last ditch effort.

[January 2018 - 7.4]
I enjoy my plays of Mare Nostrum, but there isn't anything that really wows me beyond the beautiful design and components. The economic system of trading resources is OK, but there's not a lot of tense decision-making or inner workings to manipulate the market, which makes it feel like random trading at times ... especially toward the end of the phase when there are only a few tokens left. The special powers are good, but I'm reminded that I like this mechanic in Kemet a lot better. The area-control and battle portion of the game are pretty basic, albeit with some fiddly rules about overtaking opponents' capital province -- you can't ever completely wrestle control of it.  

In the end, this game that seems to be brimming with theme in its design, components and characters leaves me feeling like I'm just collecting stuff to reach a victory condition.  

On the plus side, it's not an overly complex game, and the multiple routes to victory offer everyone something to go after.

Nice game.  A lighter version of Advanced Civilization which presses most of the buttons that that game presses without having to play for 8+ hours and needing a full table of players.

I cannot see myself playing this game or the 2003 one ever again.  Adjusted rating of that one too (6 to 2).   The problems inherent in multiplayer 4x games are just too much for me to overlook.   This game may be a lot of fun for some people; however my gaming tastes have changed quite a bit in the past 10 years. "Lets you and him fight" are just not my type of games. 

I put a big army and a big fleet next to my home area, turtled, and won.  I crushed any small force that came my way.  It is possible for someone to be all but knocked out of this game as well...and have to piddle along for hours.

Big kingmaker problem.  I'm not going to be kingmaker and keep the leader in check at the expense of my own position.  I refuse to do that unless I'm a close 2nd.  I actually ended up winning because the other player in the arms race w/me abandoned the effort and attacked the leader...inadvertently crowning me.

brilliant !  ... in the ancient cradle of civilization surrounding the Mediterranean, Empires fight to control the planet as we know it -- each with a special ability (most annoying to your rivals) .. the choices are many : build wonders; hero's; ships; legions; fortresses; trade with your neighbours and attempt to out-guess them as you move to expand your interests -- the gathering of resources is critical, and every eye roves to the rare commodities as one seeks to keep building -- quite very much enjoy the three leader tracks (trade; culture; military) and the fact the leader in each can determine turn order (but one by one, not all at once at the start of a turn) .. this really ratchets up the tension a few notches and one can very much hear the knifes being sharpened -- the game scales exceedingly well for 3 or 4 or even 5 players and one never feels left out, as every move all make brings an instant flavour to the pot -- great tension and tactics and the eye must be kept on everyone and what is needed to each and all -- another grand feature being the trade leader can determine the number of goods up for trade in each round -- tremendous replay value, each and every match is oh so different, this is a very involved and super interesting game guaranteed to sharpen the wits -- super presentation with excellent game board map, wonderful top drawer poker chip resources (and quite a differing lot of resources to keep the game interesting) really nicely designed legion, tower, trireme , city & temple pieces -- great artwork throughout, very classic wonder & hero designs .. a great visual treat -- a brilliant battle of wits and a super absorbing evening always guaranteed -- out of the top drawer of civilization-'war' confrontation games

Have played now 2 times, including just this past Sunday with one of my boardgaming groups who enjoyed their experience.   A really  nice, medium weight empire/civilization building game with a really interesting trade mechanic, along with building and move/battle mechanics.  I just have the base components, but they work just fine.  I also have the Atlas expansion, so there's lots of replayability in this game, as well as flexibility for 2-6 players.  Looking forward to playing this game again many more times in the future.  Also, Academy Games has a really good ~23 minute tutorial which will get you into the basics of this game very quickly.

+ The game looks amazing, especially with 4 or 5 players on the big neoprene map. 
- It's probably a bit longer than I'd like given the true choices you have to make turn to turn.

This game seems to favor those that know what strategy should be taken by their particular faction based upon cities/resources available.  If you don't follow what you should be doing, you are probably not going to win.

You also need to keep track of what resources players are getting on their turns so that you can keep them out of what they need.  For example, I played Egypt and was able to get a wonder or 2 to get more money, and then on one turn traded for 4 more coins and the win on about turn 5.

RATING: 4
This game requires too much work from the players with the constant taking resources and using them to purchase upgrades.  Also the game ends before the last round ends; players all know who is going to win and everyone gives up.  This is a Risk/ CIV game that has promise with some of the mechanics but due to how much work it takes to move the game along and an anticlimactic ending it's a lot of work for too little reward.

Une MAJ plus qu'un nouveau jeu. Du coup ce n'est plus du tout dans les standards actuels. Le jeu est poussif et favorise l'immobilisme. Faire la guerre tot c'est invariablement perdre. La plupart des changements sont biens mis à part changer les cartes ressources par des jetons. 

Le jeu n'est pas aussi passif que ma 1ere impression.

Mais Dieu que les méchaniques sont frustrantes. Cette phase de Commerce ne sert à rien. Ce systeme de combat au dés est Soo XXe siècle. Les objectifs sont chiant. Les victoires en skred fréquentes ....

J'ai pas l'impression que les modules sauvent grand chose car ils font plus de kingmaking en fait.

Possible que ça soit moins nul avec des spécialistes mais autant être spécialiste dans un bon jeu ...

A Eurotrash hybrid and definitely not my type of game.

Suffers from fallaway loser syndrome, big time. One mistake and you're in for an hour and a half of either keeping good face while getting constantly beaten on, or kingmaking. Direct attacks mean that it's always advantageous to beat up on the weak guy before the others do that.

Requires diplomacy (as in Diplomacy), meaning whomever is best buddies with everyone will roll over less connected people. You need to start backstabbing and trash-talking from round 1.

Trading is an exercise in memory - remember who generated what and what have they got in hand.

And in the end it's a point-salad race with little theme integration - Ameritrash looks with Euro victory. Theme is entirely superfluous. It could be anything - this is not a civ or engine building game, it's a social deduction game with set collecting elements.

Very nice design work though, and great components in the KS version.

RATING: 7
I've wanted to play Mare Nostrum for awhile, even before the new edition came out. So I was glad that my first play was with this one, given that there have been decent improvements made since the first edition.  It really doesn't feel like a civilization game at all and wears its mechanics on its sleeve, but everything is streamlined, straightforward and relatively easy to grasp, but doesn't sacrifice depth for it (though the game is hardly "thinky" - turns move quickly). Multiple win conditions is always nice, though there is a feeling that you might have to concentrate on one and if players want to shut you down, it wouldn't be too difficult.  (Though this would most likely put their own win conditions in jeopardy.)  Bash-the-leader is encouraged through "diplomacy" though again, it would be situational and forces each player to keep their plan(s) somewhat covert to avoid such a situation.  The rule-breaking Leaders and Wonder tiles that you can pick up is always an aspect I enjoy in "dudes on a map" games. If I have one major complaint it is that a winner can be decided on where you begin and what your neighbour is doing.  With the seas separating a 4-player game into areas of 2 players each, and with the warring southern end of the board, neither player on that end wished to build boats and open up a second front to the north (smart thinking!) That being said, my opponent to the east (I being Rome and her being Greece) played defensively the whole time.  There was never a point where attacking would benefit me.  So I spent the game building a resource engine and turtling to the win.  That being said, experienced players would likely see this happening and have to be "diplomatic", cross the sea, and beat the snot out of a turtling player (who is most likely pursuing a Pyramids or Leaders/Wonders win).  Thus, the game should balance with repeat plays but then it will become a bash-the-leader/kingmaker game at times, so be prepared for that kind of game play if that really discourages you.  So overall, a good game of its type. Nothing revolutionary to the genre, but a good way to play out a map conquest sort of game.

There are some very good things about this game. I like the way that you need to trade to build bigger and better things. I like camels and yurts. I like the cities producing money. However I don't want to play this game (again) because not long after I build all those things I start butting up against the enemy and we have to fight and everything gets smashed. That part of the play doesn't interest me *at all*.

Do you think Diplomacy should be a boardgame genre?  Do you love Game of Thrones' grind towards dominance?    Then you'll  love Mare Nostrum.  Best played with a full compliment of players, Mare Nostrum delivers a rich twist on Diplomacy that you may even finish.  

Scrabble for advantage in trade, war, and economy all the while knowing that today's gain likely makes your opponents stronger tomorrow.  Talk your opponents into war or into taking care of the leader on their dime while you quietly solidify your own position.  A tight map gives you a turn or two of breathing room and then forces you into confrontation.  No sitting back and "turtling" in this game.

Definitely my favorite of this genre (which I generally hate).  I give it four out of four "will play it because my friends like it."

Best ancient civ game, that involves fighting, trade, alliances- without the complexity. It is fairly simple to explain and begin playing, unlike many civ games. Far better than any version of Antike (it's closest competitor), I think- less dry and evokes more theme.

Purchased the additional buildings pack & giant map. With the giant map and pieces, the game feels & looks truly epic... extraordinary & probably one of my top 10 games of all time.

The game just does not quite scratch the itch of war game, a 4x game, a diplomacy game or a civ game. The win conditions feel hollow, and the combat (decided by dice X units) seems to pretty much guarantee mutual destruction in most cases. At any rate, a very stylish presentation that ultimately comes off as very bland when being played. It doesn't help that your starting civ greatly constrains and largely dictates your strategy. I can't quite say it is a bad game, as all of the mechanics "work" but it's so unsatisfying, too lite for hobbyists and too heavy for casual players that I have appropriated the unit components for games of my own design... yeah. I'd still play the game under the right circumstances, but my copy has probably already seen the height of its reign, and it was hardly one for the history books.

This may be the civilization euro/wargame that we have been waiting for years. It has pretty much everything: asymmetric empires, a real map, special powers and different kinds of units. Yet it plays smoothly and very straightforward. Keep in mind that this is not really a development game; it's so furious that in a few turns you will be either attacking someone or defending from someone. It's easy to focus in one of the many winning conditions but it's a real challenge to prevent your opponents to reach their own.

This probably chimes well with the American psyche, it's all about having power and thoroughly screwing over those who do not, but the bottom line is than when one player (Greece) can be put out of contention by another (Rome) player's first action then the game is broken.

RATING: 3
High production value. Simple rules set. Mare Nostrum provides a "dudes on a map" experience set in the ancient Mediterranean Sea pitting non-contemporaneous empires against each other. There are four different victory conditions. Each province, when controlled militarily, provides some resource production. There is a wonky resource trading round each turn. Rounds also have resource production phase, purchasing phase, military movement. Maybe the most outstanding feature of Mare Nostrum: Empires, which would be an otherwise fairly banal design, are unique leaders and wonders that, after purchase, provide interesting, powerful persistent rule-breaking benefits. The resource trading seems a bit much, failing to deliver an experience payoff commensurate with the effort and time costs. I have come to understand that "dudes on a map" - area control compelling conquest and table diplomacy is a game mechanic I detest, particularly when the players don't start on an equal footing, that is where the different geographical starting points have varied advantages, for example one starting position has more room for peaceful expansion before fighting than others. I don't hate Mare Nostrum: Empires. Am I eager to play it? nope. 4.5/10

OK - let's first acknowledge that the game in gorgeous.  The deluxe bling edition is super-eye-candy.

The mechanics were neat and the game did some things other civ-building / operating games try, but in much less of a time commitment.

Game suffers from "Munchkin Syndrome."  It's a multi-player game . . . eventually, one player makes a move, several other players pounce on that player to keep them from winning . . . and the guy way across the board who neither gets pounded on by other players, nor has to commit any resources to keeping anyone in check, is the one who wins.  Basically, the player who is successful in drawing the least attention from other players is the one most likely to win.

I'd play again, acknowledging the limitations of the type of game that it is.

I've only played twice now, so my rating may go up or down a bit, but I think that for me this eclipses most other civ-lite and dudes-on-a-map games. I love how the core of the game is pretty simple (e.g., a battle is just one roll of the dice), but then that's overlaid with 4 ways to win and asymmetric starting forces and powers and the option to customize your strategy from there. Production values are excellent, with a great balance of form and function.

I haven't played Avalon Hills' Civilization, but this feels like what a modern version of that game would be. Several nations set around the Mediterranean trade resources, build, and attack each other to achieve one of several victory conditions. 

Things break down when less experienced players mix with veterans as the game can end suddenly without warning. It seemingly falls into a kingmaking problem but with experience players can recognize winning turns and act to stop them.

One of my favourite themes and the game I played was a deluxe version with giant neoprene map.

I've only played once, it was 6 players.  The only interaction I had with 4 of the players during the game was the trading.  It ended fairly quickly (c. 2 hrs) with Greece getting a 12 coin victory without having attacked or been attacked for the whole game.  

I did terribly as Atlantis and there seems nothing I could have done to mitigate that (other than rolled lucky dice throughout or persuaded Rome to stop attacking me).  Every player (other than Rome and Atlantis) was close to a victory condition by the end of the game.

Mare Nostrum: Empires is a wonderfully deep and satisfying civ experience that blends aspects of war and euro games elegantly. The trading and dynamic turn order mechanics provide fresh elements and key decisions along the way. Tension builds as players vie for territory, resources, leadership, etc. Superb design and components, especially each nation having unique legions. It is a bit fiddly and seems to require a full contingent of five experienced players to enjoy fully. If you can pull that off at your table, Mare Nostrum: Empires is worth the effort.

Two games played back to back one four player and one five player, I won both games by the be top on all three tracks condition. Very proud moment the second time I did it.


Really enjoy this type of game, love the theme, the map is great too as it give everyone there own space to expand slightly but you are always from the beginning right up against someone else if you wish.

The trading aspect takes up a lot of time when I feel it could just be a simple question of does anyone want to trade? Yes/No, done. 



Not a fan of the two player version personally.

Owned the game since it's release and was finally able to sit down and play a 6 player game.  I was learning the game with others that were seasoned veterans so I was always a turn or two behind in my strategy as I grasped the mechanics.  The game was very easy to learn and a lot of fun to play.  Battles can be brutal for the attacker especially if the defender has a fortress in play.  The game does have many tough decisions to make which I enjoy.  I am not a fan of trading/bartering elements in games but this one has a wonderful mechanic for trading so it is a lot of fun and adds to the tension.  Our 6 player game lasted about 2 hours 30 minutes but the rules were gone over before play commenced so I say more like 2 hours.

Empires in many respects improves upon the original edition, particularly in relation to the ease of adjusting player count and some aspects of the presentation, and it remains a well-designed game with easily grasped rules. The problem with it for me (also true in the first edition) is that its civ/4x trappings occlude the fact that this is at heart a set collection/resource game that requires players to be far more carefully attuned to their neighbors' resource collection than to the military state on the game board. In all three games I've played across editions (admittedly with mostly inexperienced players each time), someone's banged out a quick, "sneaky" win, usually with pyramid building, that ends the game before or just when the game was seeming to get started. This opacity leaves a bad taste in people's mouths in many cases and discourages repeat playing, which means that it either doesn't get played or gets played with people who fail to grasp the true nature of the game.

Interesting, but a bit slow moving area control game. Resource trading, multiple winning conditions and three layered turn order system are brilliant. You have to be very aware of the board position to prevent anyone from sneakily cruising to victory. With experienced players this might be very long, because you always have the chance to beat the leader very efficiently.

2017-01-08 - 7 - The first game started rather slow, becoming more and more interesting with time. The rules are rather simple, but not so easy to explain efficiently. Or I just need to play it more. The experience should make this game faster. I'm not exactly sure what to think about this one, but I guess the 7 rating will change and I hope it will change up.

2017-01-14 - The rating stays. Our second game was opposite of the first. The first half was exciting and second was slow, waaay too long and quite boring as noone was able to win. We decided to stop and call it a draw. Not a good sign. I guess we will try again, but with 5 (second game was with 4) and with all the wonders and heroes available.

2017-06-08 - 7->6 - It's difficult to bring to the table, especially when I don't really want to suggest it. My both games had some issues and lasted too long. I might give it last chance, but I might as well get rid of it.

The ruleset is clean, and it has a lot of interaction and different competing elements which aren't just there for the sake of it. I enjoy the system.

I put this in a similar boat to game of thrones - a decent strategy game you don't have to take too seriously. It's less fiddly and shorter, and feels like it might have more variety through the different win conditions and ability for everyone to directly engage each other.

RATING: 6
All in all not a bad game. But it just feels like the same every time. This is because of an setup that is always exactly the same for every faction. We also felt, that the faction limits the way you need to play to much, and that hero powers aren't properly balanced for the different combinations. While I do like a lot of the mechanics those mentioned things (and some more) made the game to less fun to really want to play and keep it.

RATING: 8
I like the original Mare Nostrum, as it's a civ game that takes an economical stance rather than a conflict one (though there definitely is some conflict.) It's never been an all-time favorite, but I don't mind playing it at all.

This edition, while less aesthetically attractive, does some great work with making it more streamlined and tight. The fact that you can't bog down the trade phase anymore is a huge improvement, and the visual cues for the items that gain one offices are also quite nice. Our game didn't have much conflict and the offices seldom changed, so hopefully that would change in other plays.

We included the Atlas expansion, which added a sixth player seamlessly. 

I'm not a MN superfan, and didn't have much issues with the original, but this version seems to really polish it up. Shame the artwork isn't as good.

Got in a play of this last week with a KS edition with upgraded Map, Minis and Tokens. I walked by when some people in our game group were setting up and was very impressed by how it looked. Game took about 3 hours with 4 players. What a great experience! I love how quickly the tides can turn towards the end of the game. There is also quite a bit of Diplomacy involved if the other players are willing to make deals. It was very engaging and very immersive and not overly complicated. Perfectly weighted in my opinion. I also love that turn order changes at every round based on what the culture, trade and military leaders decide.

A "waro", that mixes war game area control with winning conditions.  You play to either build the pyramids, a fifth hero or wonder, capture 4 capitals or legendary cities or dominate all leader tracks.   In the game you gather resources, trade resources, build military units, trade locations, cities and control markers, wonders or heroes.  You then use your military units to move and battle.  

The first play with newer players may end quickly, but more experienced players with quickly see that there are multiple paths to victory and need to work to their strengths economically.  

I love this game and cannot wait to play it again.  Many clever options in this game.

RATING: 7
Not a bad game, but I'm not sure if I am willing to chase it down.  The rules are streamlined with very little ambiguity involved.  The first game with 5 new people took 2.5 hours, which includes the teaching time.  

I do find the game to be one of the better and lighter 4X games.  Compared to games like Kemet and Cyclades, I find this one to be far more enjoyable and dynamic.  With the four multiple paths to win, it allows players to be creative and explore the system that Serge Laget has laid for them.  

My main concern is due to the game ending via specific victory conditions as opposed to rounds, the game can result in a "beat the leader" that games like Cyclades, Munchkin, and Inis suffer from.  I haven't played the game enough to judge that, but I can certainly see it as a possibility.

Funny thing is I would've probably purchased this game if Scythe didn't exist.  Since both are 4X games, I find Scythe to provide a far more interesting puzzle to solve and giving that Cold War tension while Mare Nostrum: Empire seemed a little more straightforward on what needs to be done.  I like games that provide tough choices to the player and while Mare Nostrum provides them, I just find Scythe's decision making to be a more interesting affair.

The other issue with Mare Nostrum is the fiddly nature of the game.  Numerous components, especially the goods, can easily sprawl all over the table making it a mess as the game goes forward.  Putting the game away also makes it a challenge where numerous bags are needed.  Setup was also a challenge due to the various chits that need to be placed on the map and near the player before the game starts.

This is not to say that Mare Nostrum is bad.  If you have any interest in civilization building games like Kemet or Cyclades, I would highly recommend checking this one out.

This game isn't as much a game as an excuse to argue two hours at the table with some tokens on it. This is really just Diplomacy pretending to be (and failing) a modern 3X (no Xploration). "Bash the leader", "rich get richer", "kingmaking", outcomes decided by luck... it's all there. The horrible looks don't help it, either.
But take me with a grain of salt, I don't overall like diplomatics in games. If I have to say one good thing about this, it's the multiple winning conditions, where their probabilities seem balanced pretty well.

Kickstarter. This is even fun with 2 player. Haven't tried out all the expansions bonuses but don't feel the need to yet. The only complaint I have is that you can do two player just fine with the base game and the fact that they imply you need Atlas is weird. I would have been upset if I wasn't a kickstarter and bought both only to find I can do it with the base game alone and didn't need to spend the extra $50.

I'm still looking for one of these war/Euro...Waro...games that I actually like. Mare Nostrum comes close, but ultimately it's a bit too dry for my tastes. I want a game that really captures the theme of ancient civilization, and this is simply a game of going after gold or a variety of different resources. The game feels less like a dudes on a map game, and more like a spiteful worker placement, even though in actuality it's just territory control. The combat system and trading are fairly unique, but I just wasn't excited by this. I'm beginning to think that finding one of these games that I like is futile...

RATING: 7
An ambitious attempt to create a civilization game without sacrificing the elements that give an epic feeling. Here you find expansion across land and sea, building of infrastructure and development of abilities and interactive trade - all exemplary well-oiled with low downtime. I particularly like how the leaders in different areas get to pick turn order as well as the trade where the players pick resources one by one. Perhaps the strategy is a bit restricted by the initial setup and the open victory conditions may result in king making but the risk should be small with experienced and competitive players.

Too long for just a frustrating game where if the other players want to they can just maintain your head under water for the whole game... Never see a game so repetitive, depending 100% on the actions of the others. The material is ok

Gioco interessante ma molto dipendente dalla fase delle contrattazioni e anche dal kingmaking. Come in tanti giochi di questo genere (Risiko, Shogun, Scythe) conviene non attaccare, stare in difesa, coltivare il proprio orticello cercando di non dare nell'occhio. Un gioco che porta i segni del tempo anche se la nuova versione Empires cerca di rifarsi il trucco per sembrare più moderno non riuscendo in toto nei sui propositi anche perché a rimanere abbastanza federe al suo predecessore.

Just have played a demo.  I am not sold on the dice combat but I love that it has several unique mechanics including turn order determined by the leaders and how the trading works.  If the playtime is really around 2 hours and I had the right group for it I think I could even get past the dice based combat and really really like this game.

El año arrancó con la reelaboración de un clásico.

Algunos lo consideran un juego de civilizaciones, y si bien no comparto, es verdad que Mare Nostrum incluye elementos que lo llevan más allá de ser un simple "dudes on the map". En lo personal, me da más sensación de 4X que de civ, porque todos están al alcance de todos y los combates hacen que las fronteras vayan y vuelvan de forma muy dinámica.

Otros lo consideran un Catán en esteroides, por el peso principal de la mecánica de intercambio. Claramente considero que este es el elemento que hace brillar al diseño y le otorga su propia personalidad. El intercambio sin negociación es una característica que ayuda mucho al paso fluido del juego y yo mismo incorporé en el diseño de Imperios Milenarios.

Otro elemento interesante que lo distingue de los juegos de "dudes on the map" es la engine de líderes que vas armando fuera del tablero. Entiendo que ahí están las pro-strategies, y buena parte de la variabilidad, pero me dejó un sabor amargo el azar en el orden que los líderes aparecen.

El track de prestigio en distintas áreas es un recurso bastante bien logrado, y que se ha consolidado como una fórmula en los juegos de este género (Terra Mystica por ejemplo). El efecto en la iniciativa funciona muy bien y es uno de los elementos más atractivos de la dinámica de juego, una vez que llegás a incorporar la importancia del orden de turno.

En resumen, un juego sólido, muy bien producido y mecánicamente muy interesante. Como un "purista" del género de civilización me deja sentimientos encontrados. El esquema de decisión es un tanto simple y directo, mayormente táctico y librado a variaciones arbitrarias de los demás jugadores. Por momentos siento que el juego me lleva de la mano, porque todos avanzamos más o menos al mismo paso y cualquiera al final está a punto de ganar. Combinado con la interacción directa, no es raro que la última ronda te presente el problema del kingmaking.

Es un sensación parecida a la que me dio el Cyclades. Genial temática y producción, engine elegante y fluida, balance dependiente de los jugadores y un final forzosamente ajustado. Está bien para un juego de complejidad media, un segundo paso después de los gateways, pero para juego avanzado le falta más pro, más broken. En Cyclades lo encontré en la expansión Titans. En Mare Nostrum, todavía no está ahi.

9 plays - Kickstarter Edition 2015. A war game that won't kill your whole evening. It's almost impossible to play a game without multiple poeple being on the verge of winning.

Mare Nostrum: Empires is a light-weight, civilization based, euro-war hybrid that adds in just the right mix of mythology to a mostly historically based game. With four different winning conditions you constantly have to pay attention to your opponents throughout the game but it leaves plenty of room for evolving strategies.

Pros:
* Great looking game board and components.
* Deceptively easy to teach and learn.

Cons:
* Most of the complaints come from easily correctable cosmetic issues.
* They should have stuck with infantry miniatures instead of helmets.
* The plastic building miniatures should be included with the base game.
* Spaces without tokens on the game board should have just been grayed out instead of the inverse color - this can lead to confusion during setup.
* Legendary city tokens should have been a different color than the regular cities not just larger.
* Resource tokens can become fiddly and some of the symbols on them are easy to confuse with others.
* Publisher requires you to register to download the rules - what is this the 1990's?

RATING: 5
One key issue, for me, was the way in which optimal moves quickly become transparent -- especially as the end game is approaching. e.g. Player X will be able to gain control of enough cities to win, so I need to do this to block him, and you will then need to do that to block my victory, etc... Or: If X is able to trade these two resources away, she'll be able to make the pyramids. So, you need to do so-and-so to prevent that...

The decisions players need to make are never that interesting or difficult. It's just a matter of grinding through the motions with the all the open information (e.g. everyone's resource production).

Remake of [thing=3931][/thing]. Can't say what the differences are. But, this is a war, trading, area control type game. generally I am not a fan of trading games but this game is quite clever. I really have to say I enjoy the trading mechanic here. It really had me thinking about how to best way to occupy the tracks and gain control of positions. I definitely want to give this game another go. The more I have been talking about it the more I want to play it again. Really got me thinking and I am definitely interested in this game and want to play again. I love the poker chips add on. Joe C is crazy and I love him for that but they were expensive and totally worth it. :)

First impressions: A streamlined civ game with interesting leader mechanic which allows players to control order of actions. Unfortunately, I feel the game is a little dry and repetitive. The constant bookkeeping for goods types is also a bit fiddly, and I can see the end game triggers being anti-climactic. The production quality of the game is top notch, however. I love the artwork and all the components are practical and look great on the board.

Played a six player game this, many of who had AP issues. But then the same AP-prone players were fun to trash talk! So lots of fun had to be had!

Players have to balance the game; the game doesn't do this for you. So Eurogame fans stay away. But like many of the comments for this game, it seems like the best strategy is not to get into fights.

I backed the kickstarter just expecting another over-complicated civ game (which I enjoy to collect and play, but most of my friends do not).  I was very pleasantly surprised to find out this game is incredibly accessible to players of all levels of play.  There appears to be a large amount of strategic depth to this game, but it is also very approachable for players of lighter games.  I highly recommend this game to any gaming group which enjoys games including direct conflict.

Update - This game has become the favorite of my gaming group, even beating out Scythe!  The game gets even better after everyone really understands the concepts.

Simple game of civilization building and light combat.

It has the same problem as many other combat-and-territory-control games: it's hard to affect players who start on the opposite edge of the map.

You have to rely on other players to keep distant opponents in check. Who wins may often be decided by which player is most left alone than by which player has the most skill.

RATING: 9.2
One of the best area/nations/history/map oriented strategy game. Very flexible with regard to player counts (very good for 4-6, even 3 looks good).

Some similiarities with Scythe are definitely there, but, both are very different games with different feel. Scythe is more dynamic, tactical and 'chaotic' (for the reason of moving abilities), Mare Nostrum is more strategic and requieres a lot of planning. Both games are great.

Luck present in MN is just perfect as dice values eliminates any extreme results. Logic of moving and battles is very good and adds a lot to the overall feel of the game. This is as close as possible to 'smooth develop/expand your civ in relatively short playing time' game.

MINUSES...

Although Poker Jetons are beautiful and buildings are very nice and usefull, you have to pay a lot of extra money to get them. Miniatures included are OK, other Mare Nostrum components are just subpar :-( Especially bad are Player boards, Players covers, low quality area/leadership tokens, even Hero/Wonders tokens are very low quality. Big disappointment is map which is just way too small. 

Scythe has much much better components overall,

Really love this game. Doesn't drag forever. Each game is different. Simple elements that make deep strategy. 

Player to player interaction is merciles - after few turns you need to gank the leader of he will win so alliances are really temporary and easily broken, wars are put on hold to fight someone else etc. 

Mostly language independent. So if you like me have non-english version of the game - to play with foreigner all you need to do is print one page and you are set to go

Don't play with loosers, crybabies or weakminded people.

Only 1 play in so far.  Seems like it can escalate VERY quickly, but you know what? I like that.  It keeps you on your toes the entire time and makes every turn from about 3 onwards very tense.

I'm less of a fan about the resource phase where everyone has to locate and grab chips (and then eventually put them back).  I feel like the cards from the old version would have made this a bit easier.

KS copy arrived right at the end of August 2016. Could have already bought it from an online store and had it delivered. As an overseas customer it's a bit of a disappointing KS experience really. Oh well, looking forward to getting it to the table real soon.

Doesn't disappoint. Not sure which of the many small rules tweaks from the original gives me a slightly more positive feeling about this game, but I'm thinking it's the additional two victory conditions that keeps the players on their toes. There's lots of little tweaks in the new edition, but nothing major that would screw up a good base of a game to build on. (e.g. Statue of Zeus is now a peace treaty for a turn instead of allowing you to build two Fortresses.) I particularly like the new escalating cost of the Heroes and Wonders, instead of the original nine goods value, because it brings many more interesting abilities into play faster than the original. So Academy Games have done a fine job at refining a game that needed a bit of fine tuning. There's got to be a few other candidate games out there looking for the Academy Games treatment.

The people I play this with like a bit of biffo, agro, in your face aggression in their games and this delivers, so that's why I play it with people who like that in their gaming time. If you can't handle having your cities trashed, your markets stolen from and four other players at the table beating you down if you're dominating then I don't recommend this for you. If you walking into the game expecting all that then build your fortresses, defend your borders, buy your defensive Heroes and Wonders... have fun. It's just a game.

The game has the potential to be quick if players plan ahead and concentrate on the game. It runs a fair bit longer if you're going to chat and not concentrate on the changing board (because you don't know the turn order beforehand), but social trading, building and warring can be a nice way to play as well. The five face up Wonders & Heroes is an idea I'd like to always play with. It'll mix up play between games and doesn't overload players with information or choices. Games should run only about 4-6 turns and 90 minutes with five players is very achievable.

The production is nice, although the original game had rather nice bits and board as well. (The helmet pieces are nice, the Triremes a bit too small. The market tokens are clearer to define from the city tokens. Trade chits are nicer to handle than cards.) I don't find the board too small in this edition. It wouldn't be hard to play your original edition of the game with a modified version of the new rules if you wished, so I'm not sure whether it's worth upgrading your copy if you have the original.

Rues have some discrepancies (particularly between translations). Note to self: FAQ seems to indicate that people are playing Fortresses get an automatic 5 to attack sum even when not rolling any dice. (ie. One auto hit.) They can also be used to initiate combat on player's move and battle turn.

FUN ★★★★✰
Gather 5-6 friends around the table, each becoming a emperor of a great civilization, and see what happens in terms of trade, politics, expansion, warfare, alliance, development. All the mates I played with have had a good time (around 4-5 hours a play). This game has a right balance between interest and rules complexity.

RULES ★★★★★
The rules are very well written, easy to catch and teach, comprehensive.

IMMERSION ★★★★✰
Players feel that they are building a civiization around the Mediterranean Sea. Each side has its own specifities through its leaders and the cards it can purchase. The changing turn order brings some excitement along the play.

DEPTH ★★★★✰
We played it around 8 times and every time we had fun and found new situations. There are different ways of winning the game, so that each civilization can win on its own strength using various schemes.

I have the original, which we play with house rules to improve game balance. This new version is better and doesn't seem to need any fine tuning. The plastic components look great, though I miss the wood for sentimental reasons. Using tokens instead of cards saves space on the table. Definitely recommended.

This is becoming my favorite 6 player game.  I give this a 10 because of the fun we have every time we have played.  Yes, the trade has some flaws in it and people can get butt hurt when a victory is stolen from them when the other players gang up to stop them from winning but when this happens you can always see where the mistakes were made.  The game is simple to learn but players forget rules or the definition of terms which causes you to frequent the rule book often during the first 5 or 6 games.  It is best to have a couple of people know the rules so they can keep track when an error is made.  I just read through the rules again and noticed I missed that everyone puts their trade goods out upside down and then all the players flip them over at the same time to reveal what will be traded this round.  I also missed that the victory won by taking over legendary and capital cities only needs to be occupied or controlled.  Occupy being the key word to this as this is much easier to obtain then control of a territory.

Very nice production. Good value for KS backers.

RATING: 6
If you're looking for a classic civ-building war game, Mare Nostrum is cleaner than most, but it doesn't reinvent the genre like Kemet or Blood Rage do. As a result, it shares a lot of classic wargame flaws. For example, if you get knocked down, it's really hard to come back.

RATING: N/A
Great theme play.  Moderately easy to learn & play.  Interesting combat mechanic.  Lot of bonus modifiers to keep track.  Components are excellent - colorful mounted board, plastic playing pieces, thick cardboard tokens & card stock player shield/board.  The rulebook is unclear and not well organized.  makes the mechanics seem more complicated than they are and makes the game harder to learn than it should be.  Game length is long by today's standards but does not drag since downtime is minimal.

Awesome and "slim" game.
To my opinion the best risk /eclipse style boardgame on the market.

Main pros are 
- the different victory conditions: so it is not about the military leader - it is just one option :-) 
- the rules: just 10 pages (!) and very few rules as they are streamlined to the raw essentiells 
- the variance in gameplay and the evolution within a group
- time: you can get away with 3h for 5 players: fits nicely in an evening

interesting strategy game with nice Classic Antiquity Mediterranean Sea theme

+ cool theme for that kind of game
+ several victory conditions and strategies
+ some nice mechanics (trade/cultural/military leader tracks, different leaders choose play order in different phases, resources system and trading, heroes/wonders unlock special abilities, interesting combat system, ...)
+ asymmetric player powers
- a bit fiddly and takes a bit to setup
- I wonder if the game is fully balanced (Greeks/Pericles and Ramses seemed overpowered). ?
- It's a bit hard to keep track of how close players are to winning (especially with Pyramids).
- fixed starting points and state for the factions (fitting for the theme but limits variance)

refreshingly different
but might have room for improvement


I wonder if the Pyramids and the 5 Heroes victory conditions make an interesting end game impossible Pyramids victory comes very sudden, 5 Heroes victory is kind of inevitable after x rounds. Both make a longer game with a lot of conquering impossible. In my first game we barely had one battle and then a sudden Pyramids victory. Maybe every side has to play a lot more aggressive to limit the resource production of others, I'm not sure.

Played around 25 games with 3, 4, 5 and 6 players.
Excellent game, very enjoyable. Definitely in my top-10. KS edition with big map & buildings add-on & the resource chips.  Must say the big map really adds to the immersion, very impressive. 
Average playtime: 1-2 hours, depending on number of players.

Easy to learn (although harder to master) and still with enough tactical depth, very accessible for casual players. Best tactic is to balance between resource gathering and defense/military. 
The only things that could use some improvement are the mediocre trade system (weak with 3-4 players) and some unbalanced heroes/wonders.  Some empires (Greece) are a bit stronger than others (Atlantis) although the new leader expansion will balance that out a bit better, especially for Egypt and Atlantis.

I think this is a great game for sure.  I need a few more plays to solidify a rating.  The upkeep between dolling out resources and moving everyone around on the three tracks is tedious.  But in the end its worth it.  Our first 2 games, both 5 players, were pyramid victories.  All players build up their military but everyone was too tentative to attack.  We could/should have stifled the leaders more than we did.  Fun game.  Love the different paths to victory.

RATING: 8
This game is great. The artwork is very beautiful and I especially like the Antike theme to it. I loved my first game and really wanted to play again. It feels very much like a mix of the computer-games Civilization and Total War. Just like a very well improved Risk.

At the same time, the winning conditions don't seem balanced to beginners. It may be possible, that gamers that play more recently may be able to prevent one of the players from building the pyramids. But if not, the pyramids seem way to overpowered to get an instant win. Sadly, military is way to difficult to win, so it's more like a possibility to screw you as well as another player. It's not really a winning option. Furthermore, Battlesystem could be improved upon. So while the game is great, in my opinion it lacks balance and it doesn't seem to be a good game for first-time-players, meaning gamers who play Mare Nostrum their first time. I'd love to have a game like Mare Nostrum, but some things just need to get fixed or balanced in order for me to consider buying it.

I am a sucker for civ building games and this one is really interesting in that it can play a variable amount of players with adaptable scenarios (sadly only one two-player scenario as of now available, hopefully fans will create more). This one is probably going to fill the "Risk"-shaped niche in my collection, more so than Golden Ages does (although that's a good one, too). It helps that my favorite german publisher - Schwerkraft - is involved with the german version. First play was great, despite being a solo multi-handed affair, two player games worked fine with the barbarians and the four player game was a hoot (and upped the rating).

After a single play.  I Really like the trading mechanic, but we played a 4p game with too many expansions and I'm not sure I liked the game balance.  I got hammered on three sides in this game an felt completely out of it for much of the game.  And I felt like Rome couldn't get a foothold.  Would try again, but not super excited to get it back to the table.

Excellent production value on the Kickstarter upgrades with the resource chips, buildings and neoprene oversized map.

Plays surprisingly well at 6 players.  I really love all of the different win conditions.  It's a little unintuitive how each race is slanted towards one of those conditions, definitely a game that rewards more plays, but I like there is flexibility to go in different directions.  The tech via power tiles is really neat.  The power meter thing super fiddly, and probably my biggest detractor, having to record every single thing  purchased, conquered, removed on a track with itty bitty markers is a pain.

RATING: 9
An excellent game with a streamlined approach to conquest, light trading, and set collection all in a highly interactive and rewarding production.

One of my favorite aspects is the interconnectedness of all of the player decisions. The leadership tracks make decisions on what to build and when even more critical than for their simple building abilities. Leadership powers provide meaningful capabilities that make them worth pursuing in their own right.

Hero and wonders provide great ways to tailor your empire's special abilities in addition to the asymmetry provided by the initial hero setups.

Best of all I feel that the 4 different victory conditions allow for all players to be in the game even if they aren't in a leading position. Clever play can bring a player that is unable to compete for a pyramid or hero victory in reach of a military one.

A delight to play but the learning curve means initial plays may result in some surprise wins or that unnecessary aggression prolongs the game duration.

Very good trading/civilization game.

-----

4-player:  very good at around 2 hours.
3-player: also good, but very exhausting with no room or time to rest and took longer at around 2.5-3 hours.
6-player: ok but definitely too long at 3-4 hours and Atlantis and Babylon felt too far away from each other, effectively playing separate games.

"EARLY DELIVERY If you back us on Kickstarter, you will receive the game several weeks before the games arrive in any other retail outlets!"

The game is now in stock and for sale in the UK, but I have still not received my game. Where is it? When will I receive it?

8.5-9. Area control, war, and resource management. Not too much downtime between players and dynamic. Reminiscent of Concordia but bloodthirsty. I usually dislike games which end immediately when someone meets the victory condition but building your empire feels substantial enough here where it is still satisfying in the end and you can see the end coming.

I was curious about this game, as I never got around to trying the original. While it wasn't awful, there is no reason I can think of to play this instead of Cyclades, which does the whole "2 hour whack-a-mole with a veneer of resource management" thing MUCH better. The trading phase is the only aspect of Mare Nostrum that isn't completely generic, but it's not very intriguing or fun. I also felt the myriad victory conditions were a flaw, as the game is entirely focused on not letting other players win. Having to parse through it all to figure out if anyone is close to any given victory condition is a lot of overhead for little payoff.

[i]Preliminary rating after two 5-player games.[/i]

A solid area control game with assymetrical special powers and strong economic core. The three civilization tracks are brilliant and force fierce competition for being the leader. I also like different victory conditions, you really have to watch out for what others are doing at any given time.

I definitely need much more than two plays to truly understand the interrelations between each and every action, but my first impressions were very positive.

The only drawback I can think of is that victory by building pyramids is somewhat anticlimactic - it's hard to keep track of everyone's resources and the game may end rather unexpectedly (someone just reveals their twelve tokens and says "I won" and that's it). I know that players are supposed to track that stuff, but counting everything can get tedious with 5 players.

RATING: 7
This is a partial game, but I’ve played before anyways. [b]Mare Nostrum: Empires[/b] replaces [b]Settlers of Catan[/b] for me. That sounds weird if you’ve played both games, but let me explain. The only part of [b]Catan[/b] that I truly enjoyed was the trading, however anyone who’s played it knows that you don’t always want to trade, whether you’re being a jerk on purpose or just trying to stifle others. It sounds realistic, but it’s not fun.

[b]Mare Nostrum[/b] _forces_ players to trade. At the beginning of each round, the trade leader will announce how many goods players will trade, then each player must put forth that many goods. One at a time, players will take a good from someone else, then that person takes a good, and so on. In this way, your highly specialized Egyptian culture can diversify it’s possible trade goods.

Why do you need trade goods? Well, in order to build anything you need _different_ trade goods or all money. Want to buy a soldier? You’ll need three different goods. How about a market? That’ll be six goods. Want to build the pyramids? That’s 12 different kinds of goods (in a game that only had 13 types of goods). Better get to trading.

This doesn’t even begin to cover building armies and ships and conquering others, but you don’t even have to go that route if you don’t want to.

Recommended.

A great Area Control / Resource Management game that actually combines those things remarkably well. My favorite thing of the game is the mechanics and how they are both simple and complex, and in some cases unlike most other games. The trade auction might be my favorite aspect of the game. That, and that each phase has a different player in control of either how trade goes down, Who builds first, or who moves/battles first. There is quite a bit of strategy here, and yet the game's rules are not overwhelming or out of control. I highly recommend checking this one out.

I wanted a short-term conquest- Civilization game with economic and resource management brushes,  I have an ocassional gaming group, most of us prefer few rules and simple steps, not really fans of convoluted gaming. I was spoting this game the whole year and finally arrived.  

It worked very well with my group. We have just play once but it turned to be very long +3 hours with explanation (~25 min incluiding warming round) and we didn't finish, though, we enjoyed very much. Surprisely each round was  very dramatic, quite fast and tense despite the same actions each round. Rules were quite intuitive for my group and we found the answers to our questions very fast in the rulebook. easy to grasp. It is a very balanced game because each choice implies a trade-off in all manners, cultural, economic militar, etc. I rate it with a plus star because there is a lot of interaction among players, which is a plus in all games I look for. 

I really liked the pawns, each according with their culture. I miss a lot the plastic components for buildings and caravans. I wish the game had all plastic components in the base game. In the other hand, I find that components and illustrations are very simple, basic and plain (personal and biased) for what it costs. Components are just ok, not cheap cardstock or material, I just complain the illustrations. Design works very well for the purpose of the game (layout, iconography, fonts, colors). The screen are really small and uselless, they fall down and are small.

Cyclades with more meat on the bones. Scratches the same itch. Solid game. Lots of strategy, fair bit of variety, multiple paths to victory etc. Good stuff.

Finally got this to the table. What a great game. Definitely will be brought to the table again! 

The flow of the game is so smooth, the turn mechanism is clean and easy to sort out and after the first round we're all sorted, which is impressive. Even playing our first game with 4 we ended in 90 minutes. We were utterly surprised since we thought, as with so many other games, we'd struggle to keep it even close to the typical game length. But it was no problem at all! So glad to have this in my collection.

For the moment it seems it is exclusively gamer's game which I didn't expect it to be... fell flat with non-hardcore gamers group because of the abrupt ending with pyramids. That being said, the problem was of course with players - they didn't fight a single battle, so obviously someone (Cleopatra with money) won with pyramids pretty fast. So "the problem" is that it requires repeated plays and very careful observance of others moves on which you are supposed to aggressively react - the game is not in very very simple rules, but in players (so called metagame)... that's why it's a strong gamer's game, albeit being very simple - new gamer's will be disappointed because it stimulates aggression as necessary, it punishes euro-style "I build my own empire and nobody messes with me" strategy with abrupt and dissatisfying ending.

Games that depend on the players who play them on such a high, general level - are "penalizing" group as a whole and not only individuals who play poorly - don't tend to score high in my collection so I even considered trading it away... Yet, maybe more chances need to be given.

Very challenging strategy game.  The number of ways to win or lose in this game is a big draw, and because of the multiple ways to win you are forced to adapt your strategy to your specific strengths/weaknesses in the setup.  You can choose the conquest route, economic or maybe political, but in any case you have a real chance to win.

Great game for price point (painted Mini's). Needs expansions for any kind of replay ability, and I would increase my score if there were more expansions.

[I]tl;dr - MtG:Arena has the unfortunate distinction of being a good game that's exactly the opposite of what I tend to seek out: two-player-only wizard duel with a large metagame and steep learning curve.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Nothing against Arena of the Planeswalkers, but two-player games like this are not for me. I'm not sure what to call them (the actual genre spans everything from deck-builders, to dudes on a map, to miniature games), but the general concept is a two-player duel game, usually with a lot of custom cards or fine-tuning that needs to be done to the deck/faction to make it playable. Other games in this vein would be Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn or Codex.

They may be fine games, but just aren't for me. For one, I value the accessibility of a game that doesn't make you build your own faction (though I recognize the richness of a game allowing you to do so). And for two, I just don't have a regular opponent for these types of games. 

Arena of the Planeswalkers may be a great game, but it wasn't for me.

I like this better than heroscape. The spells add a very interesting dynamic that the original was lacking. Now, if only they would release more content! 

I think the small packs wouldn't work though. Even the current medium box isn't ideal. I think a yearly full set would be best.

Interesting for sure.  I much prefer Summoner Wars, but that is probably not a fair comparison.  Maybe one 7-8 expansions have been released the game may get to where it is deeper and more interesting.  Right now, we are simply playing to discover the dominant strategy and/or faction I am certain exists.

Want to love this game, but as is I just sorta like it.

This looks like a money pit game. We played with 4 players and the game just is not that fun. It is basically a slog that just takes too long to be worth it. I do believe this would be a lot better 2vs2 or 2 player, but over all it is not that great. Sold it for this reason.

The special abilities, glyphs and spell cards bring a lot of variety to each skirmish. The miniatures are decent enough. The army and map building will be something to look forward to with the release of expansions. I'd like to see the addition of heroes, spells and 3d map pieces in the future.

A great evolution of HeroScape! The spell cards add a lot of variety and replayability to the game, and the five factions play very differently, while being very true to the CCG.
Really hope there will be expansions, as army and deck building will add even more to the game!!

[miniatures skirmish game, 2-4p]

Own all three boxes released for the game, plus aftermarket terrain.

Player loadouts will need some customization to make better.  Need to streamline the setup process.  Not sure if each card will stay permanently in a character's deck, or if I'll be okay with creating a deck on-the-spot from a list I keep in the box.

Also, my gut is to have each color only owned by a single player.  Will I have two monocolor builds each for the dualcolor planeswalkers, or will the dualcolor planeswalkers only come out in 1v1 games?

Are there any fun community-created scenarios?

May require terrain investment if I like the game.

A successful blend of Heroscape physical mechanics and Magic the Gathering's flavor. I do have a couple small gripes with the production, like the bland terrain and the fact the terrain maps aren't two sided (instead having useless character bios on the opposite side). Also I would not have minded using classic Planeswalker or wizard types rather than these 'young new hotness' characters, but I realize these must have more commercial appeal. Beyond that, it's a good dueling game, with intuitive movement rules, plenty of customization of battlefield, and more will come when they put out the inevitable expansions...IF it succeeds enough for continued support.

RATING: 4
Not so good. Could be talked into it.

I wanted to like it but:
The line-of-sight is fiddly and I could see how it could often be contentious. You line your eye up with the Target Point of the attacking figure and then you work out if you can see any part of the Hit Zone of the defending figure - which permits you to hit figures that are behind other figures/terrain, and also I presume, where terrain has gaps, you can hit through the gaps. All this, means that you then have to think about the orientation of your figure. Shields, weapons etc are not part of your figure’s Hit Zone. So depending on the orientation of a figure it may or may not get hit depending on whether any of it’s Hit Zone is visible or not. This is fiddly and probably even tedious. I much prefer Battlelore’s center of hex to center of hex.

The victory conditions in the scenario we played (Battlefield 1: The Duel), which is designed for 2-players, weren’t challenging enough to keep the game interesting. You either kill your opponents Planeswalker or you have the most PPF (Price Per Figure) points left on the board at the end of turn 30. I lost my ranged units, so getting close to my opponents Planeswalker was going to be difficult, but I had enough PPF to win the game. So, I just start running away. Now, my opponent has to chase me. Eventually, he manages to kill one of my units. He is winning by PPF and he starts to runs away. It was just this drawn out, trudge over the map. It felt so boring and dull. It just felt like going through the motions all the time. I just conceded so we could stop playing. I much prefer Battlelore’s system with the accumulation of victory points.

There are other odd things, they give you a D20, which only seems to be used to decide who goes first or to resolve line-of-sight disputes. The turn track is in the rules manual - so when you need to check a rule you need to remove and replace the turn tracker. It just doesn't feel like a well designed or even complete game. It's just lacking.

May benefit from some house rules:

Simplify line-of-sight to 'if you can see any part of a figure' then it can be attacked. Then the orientation of a figure won't matter.

Or don't worry about its orientation when placing unless it is actually attacked and then work out if it it need to be rotated to put a shield in the way, for instance.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
It was a mistake to realize the game in its current form.  There is not enough in the box to keep this game interesting.  The only choices for army building at this point is which Plainswalker to play with.  I also found that while the spell deck is important, it really feels like it doesn't have enough cards in it.  While this really is just heroscape, the mechanism that makes it interesting is the spell deck, but it feels like you run out of cards to quickly.  I also think the current army sizes are WAY too low, and at this point summoning your army is pretty pointless (they might as well just start on the board).  I could see this one growing on me when there is more content, but as of right now, I didn't find this one all that interesting.  For what it is worth, my brother who is a Magic player, liked it, so I do expect to give it a few more plays before moving on from it.

Aside from the fact it seems like the pyromancer is made to be able to murder someone is a single turn, I am just not a fan of games where hits aren't rolled often and you are often rolling close to the same dice in attack and defense.  This is kind of the same reason why I am not a big fan of X-wing because it just comes down to moving around and rolling dice over and over again until someone finally dies.

Exactly like Heroscape plus cards.........
Minus painted minis, terrain, variety, and fun.

Since the sole objective is to kill your opponent's planeswalker, it makes it so most of the battle (i.e. where the planeswalkers aren't) is inconsequential.

After having played this, it does make me appreciate Heroscape more.

Horrible miniatures with horrible paint jobs. Horrible rule book. Although, once I understood the rules, I found they made some solid changes from Heroscape; mostly I was surprised how much more fun not having to pre-program my units made the game. I couldn't imagine playing this without the original Heroscape terrain, though. When playing with Heroscape terrain I'd give it a 7. However, the base box terrain is crap so between that and the above stated "horribles", the base box gets knocked down 2 notches.

Is a blast, but I feel they should have taken over those Keyword Abilities from the original Trading Card Game, and keep it as a core mechanic. It would have made things interesting, since the Keyword Abilities are essentially what distinguishes the character of the Card Game. The problem with this base game is the problematic issue of imbalance, that removes from the elegance of the design of a game. Once rectified with your own rule tweaking, this is problem is swiftly accomplished, which I have done so with my variant, by making every Spell Card in the Game distinct in the sense that they are different, and yet balanced, with every Card serving its worth, being cost-effective and efficient., with similar power levels, and so there are no redundant Cards, or Cards that are significantly more powerful than others. This is especially true with the White Planeswalker, Gideon Jura, with Cards that repeat the same rule, but with one just more powerful than the other.

I wanted so badly to like this game. My strong Magic: the Gathering background made me cheer as I heard of the upcoming boardgame.

Unfortunately the base game comes with just 25% of its potential. It needs 2-3 expansions to reach the level where it should have started.

Where is the deck construction? Where are the different creatures?

Too bad that it took a year for the first expansion. Looks like the game won't last until the next expansions until I becomes playable and enjoyable.
Really sad.

I loved Heroscape and so far I love this game. With expansions, I could easily see this being a top 5 game for me.

A new Heroscape! That is what I was hoping for and I received more than I bargained for. It's Heroscape with a card playing mechanic. The figure quality is not the best, but good enough for this skirmish game at this price point. The prepainted Planewalkers look good to me. I do wish the bases were a separate piece as some of the molds are not flush flat. Added in with my Heroscape collection this is a must have for any Heroscape fan. As I already own plenty of Heroscape terrain I didn't mind the lack of tiles. Although the flat cardboard pieces do make a great base/starting point, and make setup a bit faster. Would recommend.

I missed the Heroscape party, but being a MTG fan as well as having recently tried the game I am fairly excited for the potential here. I hope expansions will start in early 2016, b/c that is what is going to make this game shine. I can understand wanting to keep the cost low to a base set, but Hasbro can blow a big opportunity here if there is no follow up. The idea of tactical strategy mixed with deck building is awesome. Simple rule set (once understood, I had to read some clarifications on here) and room for some deeper strategy while keeping it fairly light (about an hour playtime) makes this a solid choice.

My rating is for the entire game [family=38076]family[/family] with enough expansions to allow for true army and deck building (which I would say requires base game, Battle for Zendikar and Shadows over Innistrad). This deviates from my normal policy to rate base games and expansions separately. My rating for just this base game without any expansions would be a 6.
My rating includes a minus for how unclear many of the rule details are and that the designers are not present here on BGG at all to answer rules questions. :(
My rating also includes a minus for the line of sight rules, which I particularly dislike. I much prefer hex based rules which clearly tell you whether a figure will have line of sight or not *before you commit to your movement*. I hate a need for fiddly millimeter decisions with a laser pointer. I also hate that according to the rules, it affects line of sight how you position your figure *within* its hex.

Great game. Its a little simple, but good expansions will flesh the game out. Reminds me of a mash of Hoards and Heroscape.

Game is quick, and even if it gets added complexity, I can't see it adding to the play time by much, which I would say is great.

Played all day in a game store with many onlookers. Most complained that the components were bland, which I have to agree that they are a bit stale, but other than that its a great way to get a "Card flopper" to see what it feels like to become a real gamer. ;)

Very first board game I picked up after returning to board gaming by trading a bunch of MTG cards with a LGS that I used to go to when playing Modern MTG events. Rulebook is terrible, gameplay is uninteresting. I almost want to keep it as a reminder that I should vet every future purchase that I make, but I'd rather clear the space.

In hindsight, I'm not sure why I picked it up given how terrible Wizards of the Coast are managing MTG these days.

Magic as a board game instead of a card game. Each player controls a magician, a so called Planeswalker, and two armies of creatures with specific abilities. The objective is to gain control of some specific points on the board by the end of the game. Each Planeswalker and creature has a specific speed, attack range, offensive strength, defensive strength and health (number of wounds it can absorb before dying). These parameters can be changed by means of sorcery and enchantment cards.

The creatures should have maybe one more power and the action economy really needs work. Only acting with a single squad a turn sux! The game has a lot of potential but needs work.

Acquired 8/2015.
I picked this up because, well it had magic on it; and it had been years since I had participated in any kind of minis game.
My initial impression is that it's a solid skirmish game. The spell cards allow a player to push or reverse advantage in the right situation.
Ultimately I'm not going to be able to maintain buying new sets as they come out. I'd prefer to spend my money on games I'm more excited about. Also taking into the consideration the real-estate it eats up on my shelf.

SOLD IT! ($2)

Heroscape at held some interest by mixing cross genre characters, this is simply a VERY generic cash grab to sell a familiar licensed product with some very predictable tacked on "Magic" elements.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting game so far. Heroscape meets MtG. Rules can be confusing due to open-ended nature that anticipates expansions. It's going to get a lot better with expansions because you'll be able to draft your armies and spell decks. Right now, there's not choice there, but still a good game that should only get better. Gift from family.

RATING: 6
I think this is the right amount of everything for the start.
Easy to setup.
Fairly easy rules (I assume there is an update coming for the rulebook)
Quick to play (with 2)

Also seems like you can easily place your Heroscape figures into the mix as either an entire team or as a Summoned character.  If Heroscape characters were to be summoned, you would have to agree on if colors spells affect the Heroscape characters.  But if both sides agree on the conclusion... I say charge.  It would be great to watch Hulk defend a Planeswalker against a huge dragon.

Component quality is ok for the price. Low of course but the game was only 15 dollars so it is not really a worry. Card play is very fun. Evokes Magic. Feel stales over the board play. Maybe just not really my thing. I prefer cards for head to head battle rather than miniature posturing I guess.

Bottom line: lots of minis, which are fun to use and play with.  Change the rules and you will be happier.  Move one unit per turn makes the game nearly unbearable, there ends up being no real strategy.  The only analogy I have is watching two children break each others toys one at a time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's okay.

I mainly got it because I'm a veteran [thing=463][/thing] player, having little miniatures of the planeswalkers and creatures is cool, and because I got it really cheap.

It's not terribly complicated, but there's a huge luck factor when it comes to rolling the dice. Also, the board is almost too big which can lead to having to chase the other player around on the board.

Big fan of magic.  Never played heroscape.  Really liked the game play but hate that there isn't enough in the base set or available expansions to actually make this a customizable army and deck building game like it is meant to be.  Love the themes of the different colors just based on reading thru the cards and abilities. Looking forward to trying all 5 armies.

I had heard about Magic: The Gathering but was never intrigued enough to dive in, partly because it being "pay-to-win" and also because of having to find other players with similarly-leveled decks. Enter Arena of the Planeswalkers with its low entry cost and its promise of readily-balanced battles for up to five players. Also the new tactical layer with the map and the minis! And the very low cost! What was there not to like?

We really enjoy it every time. Cool things: when you open the box and see the full army of different minis (-quality, +every mini is different, +different colors, +did I mention it is cheap?); the variety of fighting styles of each army; the 2v2 battles; the nice card art and planeswalker images/bios; the balance between strategy/luck. Aspects I wish were better: more than one pre-designed 1v1 battlefield (the community should make their custom battlefields available to avoid always using the same tired one); battles can be as short as 15 minutes or as long as 2h (especially with more players or with over-analytic ones); some rules are unclear.

This is a fantastic game which is basically a continuation of heroscape, a game I absolutely love. This game is easy to learn , fast to play and fun with friends. That being said it still sufferes a few design flaws keeping it from a perfect 10 on my review.

1. They should of made the game board double sided for more map options

2. The quality of the figures is ok at best and the painting is sub par on the plainswalkers. 

3. In the core set there really isn't options to mix and match armies and according to the rule book you can't use another core set as unique squads can only be used once. 

4. This is a heroscape based game , why not make the figures comparable and interchangeable? 

5. Some rules are vague and I can see beginners being confused on easy concepts

Can't understand why anyone would give this a high rating. Probably people who played it only once.
Bad rulebook, worse rules.
There are several bad design choices or blatant oversights in this game. A lot of the things won't work as expected. Want to use your blue spell to copy a red spell of your opponent? Well, good luck, almost all of these spells require you to control a red creature or Planeswalker, which you won't have playing blue.
Black Planeswalker buffs Zombies, Zombies debuff black Planeswalker. Or do negative abilities only work on enemies? We'll never know.
Balance is not so good either.

[-]I've never played Heroscape and played very little of MtG. Need to give this one a few more plays before a definitive score, but I really enjoyed what I've experienced so far.  It does feel a little barren in the aesthetics department and the 3-d terrain seems sparse, but expansions and some used Heroscape terrain lots should take care of this.[/-]

Fired by Heroscape, which is better in every way. I'll probably keep these sets for the base terrain boards, which save some time, but the monsters and "Planeswalkers" are generic and uninteresting.

A solid attempt at evolving the Heroscape engine into the world of Magic the Gathering. It however misses the marks in what made the original Heroscape so fantastic.

The lack of quality, buildable terrain is a drawback. Despite that it makes set up time easy, it lacks the fun of building your own terrain.

The card element is neat and adds another level of play.

It lacks the order markers which allows players to plan their turn out in advance.

The lack of customization even with the expansions is poor.

The point system is difficult to quantify since it goes for figures as well as playable cards.

This is my first "collectible card" game (some may not call it that due to lack of content) game that I have bought and played. It is a very simple and easy to learn. Rules are intuitive which makes them easy to remember. I like the painted figures. They don't have lots of detail(for the most part) but good quality nonetheless. I found this will all the expansions for $25. I feel that the characters/ different magics are very well balanced. There are strength and weaknesses for each magic type, so when played with many people, it creates a great strategic game! There are different modes depending on the number of people. The 2v2 is the best part in my opinion but the free for all brawl with 5 people is also exciting. Overall, a great game for a great price. It won't take all night to play and changing up your deck is really fun. My negatives would include the cheap(ish) cardboard pieces that make up the terrain. Also, I wish there was more terrain that went upwards to make the board and game a bit more exciting.

It is very hard to understand how can anybody give a 1 rating to a game like this. Not saying that It should have a positive rating if you don't like it, but 1 ?  Please leave your hatred aside before giving an opinion, or better yet, elaborate!

With that aside, I think this game is the beginning of a new era on Magic. Still long ways to go, but definitely a firm and a forward step. It does have more depth that It would suggest with hand management, deck-army building, area movement. It also feels very balanced and It feels that brings lots of replay value. Hopefully some expansion would make it even more interesting.

Magic and Heroscape players would feel very attracted to this game and I am almost sure that most of them would love it (Except competitive-hard core Magic player) 

I played a demo almost all night long at a local store with some friends(Luckily I am friend with the owner and invited me :)

I will come back with in a month and review my rating for a more accurate information.

EDIT 1:
Mr.Hoss; Let me tell you that your creativity for answering an argument blew my mind away!! (in the negative sense of course), but It also left me wondering, Is it possible for someone to brain fart twice in a row?   


EDIT 2: So after playing the game for a couple of weeks in a row I can give a more accurate rating. I think the game is between 7 to 8 depending how much You like Heroscape. 
To have a chance to rise its rating, It needs more cards, figures, terrain and a BIG polishing to the rule book PLEASE!!
However I would leave the 10 rating just for Mr Hoss pleasure.

While not perfectly balanced, this game combines two of my favorite other games: Heroscape and Magic, so it's hard to really go wrong. The main problem here is simply redundancy. Since I already have a massive Heroscape collection, Star Wars: Epic Duels, and Dungeon Command (all of which are excellent) it's difficult to see what more this offers to me, especially considering the lack of painted squad figures. Interestingly, I am thinking that perhaps the first expansion will solve this problem, as it seems to be offering a co-op "raid boss" type of experience, which would be something that the other aforementioned games do not. I'm in wait-and-see mode on buying, but happy to play.

Good tactical while quick game! That's a nice package.. The artwork is of the usual awesome Magic quality. The components are.. not so good. The miniatures are bad, period. The board is okay, pretty samey & drab colours.

Played this with two, not sure if i'd enjoy the downtime in a 3 or 4 player game.

Some sound strategies you can apply, usually to the strength of your colour. Might become more versatile with expansioins.

Heroscape 2.0 - what is not to love.   The puzzle boards are funny to me, super happy I can just use HS stuff for this - since I have so much.

  After 2 plays I rate it a 10 cause I already love it.  The factions seemed balanced so far ( hard to tell I know after only 2 plays but I did read them all and the spell cards ).
  
   It will definitely start to really shine with expansions so lets hope they start to come fast and furious. for us.

  Cheap components in a way but a great way to keep the cost done, the ruins are wonky since they are added on top of the board and will negate hexes ( in HS the ruins fit perfectly in between the tiles - again the cheap buy in price ).   

  I am wondering if I will ever paint the commons?  I am guessing not, but that would make the game look so much better I am guessing.

 Bought 3 at Target on 7th of Aug.

Line of sight rules are annoying. They also almost never matter with such a wide open map, so I guess that's ok. I like the spells.

I didn't like Heroscape very much, mostly because I hated setting up the map. This avoids that at least. It still wasn't a very interesting game from what I recall. The spells I think are the only thing that save this game from a lower rating, but Arena is still only just OK

It's Heroscape light really. That said, as I've played it more I find myself enjoying it more. I refuse to play the base campaigns.

Also, after ~8 plays you will want more cards, but fans working on it in heroscape forum until expansions will be released

Arena of the Planeswalkers blends MTG and Heroscape, but it doesn't seem to bring the best of either game to the table. That being said, it is an enjoyable system in its own right and is enjoyable with proper expectations. The base set feels a bit minimal, but the expansions are cheap, so those make for easy add-ons for those so inclined. I'd almost always rather just play MTG, but this a novel, worthwhile game.

The epitome of everything I hate in gaming. Secret hidden special powers that you have to memorize for every faction to have a semblence of a chance. Faction balance is only potentially possible with highly skilled players. Luck of the draw. Dice chucking. Remeniscent of a BORG design minus thoughtfulness and elegance.

Needs a LOT more content(cards and squads).  The WalMart Bonus box comes with extra terrain, which is necessary.

Very good skirmish game, lots of strategy and tactics, low barrier to entry.  I will be happy to buy lots more content for this game and build my own deck/army.

*Overall rating has dropped because of lack of sufficient support by publisher.*

RATING: 5
As a huge Magic: The Gathering fan and a huge Heroscape fan, Arena of the Planeswalkers was so close to amazing. The thematic additions of the planeswalkers and magic cards is great, but they need to add a lot of expansions for the army building and game variety to feel fulfilling. The lack of terrain variety was also a disappointment. Hopefully with enough expansions it will be a unique and enjoyable experience.

Magic AND Heroscape? What's not to like?


Well, I can see how someone with no interest in either game might not be excited. The game is undeniably heroscape at the core. Aside from a few minor quibbles (rulebook could use more specifics), the gameplay is still great fun.

2015-10-13 - 7.5 - The board looks empty and not interesting. Except for that it is a very good game. Based on the fact that woman who explaned us this game at Spiel didn't know half the rules I think I might really enjoy this one playing properly.

2016-03-13 - 7.5->5 - I played it correctly couple of times and I think I had enough. This game seems underdeveloped as some of the rules are fiddly and I would like to houserule many things, which I really don't like to do. There is not too much strategy involved and while sometimes it doesn't bother me, here it does, as you just go there and throw your dice. Unfortunately for this game I played skirmish Imperial Assault the same day, where you move around your figures on the map and throw dice too and MtG is just worse in every aspect.

Heroscape 2.0! I am digging this, especially because I was able to get a Magic player that I work with to get a game going with me on lunch break. Setup and breakdown are super easy thanks to the six interlocking cardboard base mats.

They did away with Order Markers, but they added a whole new Spell Deck for each Player. Otherwise it's Heroscape for the most part.

Dice have the exact same distribution of sides, except they have a crossed swords icon instead of a skull icon. Shields are still shields. 

On your turn you draw one card from your spell deck, choose which army card you will be activating this turn, cast spells if you wish, move the unit or units that you selected, attack with the units you selected, cast spells if you wish (you may cast up to 3 spells each turn, either before moving or after attacking)... and then it's the next guys turn!

I must admit, I miss order markers quite a bit, but I also really like what the Spell deck adds to the game.

After a video review: seems very similar to heroscape. The game mechanics is now based around your character that can summon creatures and you try to kill the opposing players. 

The components are not as good as heroscape but is seems to sell cheaper. Could be interesting especially if you can cross over units from both games

There is also a mini spell deck for each player which is also very interesting.

the only issue for me is that I currently do not play much heroscape, but part of the reason is the time to assemble the game. this one might hit the table more easily.

The user reviews are pretty mixed because many of them does not like heroscape as a starting point.

Like other reviews have stated, this is Heroscape 2.0. If you liked Heroscape, the rules are nearly identicial, as are the plastic tile molds... but the rules they added on to Heroscape feel like they half-assed it a little. Once you get past the new rules, the game is simple, fun, and fast to play, with great tactics and strategy to be had! All for $29.99.

Very fast game to set up and play. You can easily fit a game or two within an hour, including setup time. It was more strategic than I anticipated. The game is not very forgiving of mistakes against a more knowledgeable player. I can trace each loss I've had to a very specific mistake I made, and in that, the game is very balanced in team-play. The game is not as balanced in 2-player mode, as some Planeswalkers simply have a leg up on other Planewalkers, at least until expansions release to balance them out a bit.

Current rating: 8 of 10

I might have given this an even higher rating if any of the following were true:
1) The rulebook was written better
2) The miniatures/tiles were painted
3) More tiles were included in the base game
4) More options existed for deck-construction
5) Expansions released simultaneously 

It earned an 8 for the following:
1) Well-painted planeswalkers
2) Unique miniatures are all different molds
3) They made the tiles compatible with Heroscape
4) It's MSRP is $29.99
5) The game is a legitimately good follow-up to Heroscape
6) I like the modular cardboard maps that make the game so affordable while still providing a large play area

It's essentially Heroscape 2.0 with a MTG theme.  That's not a bad thing at all.  After all, Heroscape is the game that got me into the hobby.  Well, the gameplay is solid.  Straightforward slug fest with lots of tactical decisions to make.  Less is more here.  I wish it came with more terrain and that the "land" just looked more pleasant.  It's pretty drab and boring.  But I know if they added more that would bring the price up considerably.  For what you pay you get a good game and some decent pieces.  Can't wait to see what the future holds for this game.

Not as prolific as Heroscape, and the seemingly indifferent attention Hasbro has given it has doomed it to a couple of expansions, but this is still lots of fun.

Gran variedad de minis y estrategias. Dependiente del idioma.

Maybe I'm just spoiled by other, similar games that employ a skirmish system in a better fashion, but Arena of the Planeswalkers is a total flop. Really the only redeeming thing about this game is what you get in the box. You get 5 painted miniatures, and 6 completely different figures in each color. Along with that, you get some high quality dice and map pieces. It's just too bad that the game's system is about as elementary as you can get. The cards spice things up a bit, but I do wish that there were more to choose from in the base set. I'm not the biggest MTG player these days, but I would much rather play that over this. Compared to games like Imperial Assault and Battlelore, Arena of the Planeswalkers is complete mass market trash.

A very solid game, which is reassuring since it is indeed a revival of sorts for Heroscape. Most of the core gameplay elements haven't been changed, and the integration of Magic the Gathering makes for a more variable experience thanks to the spell cards. Definitely worth playing if you're a fan of Magic as a new change of pace from the usual card gaming, and a great strategy game overall. The price for the whole package is very much a big plus for it, as $30 for everything you get is totally worth it. You don't even need to worry about whether or not expansions will come out for it, but I'm sure it will totally help.

The biggest issue is the rulebook, however. The basics of the gameplay are nicely detailed out with handy pictures for better visualization, but deeper card interactions are not discussed in any way. These aren't even corner cases, just a lack of clarification of how some card texts should function. The best way to deal with these issues is to use the Magic the Gathering rules since all the problems stem from the Magic part of the gameplay (like spells and army abilities), but that of course doesn't feel solid enough. I've nudged Hasbro a few times about some rules questions (they're in charge of the game, not Wizards of the Coast) so hopefully a nicely documented rules FAQ will be released sometime soon.

The rulebook issue may be a small barrier of entry to players who aren't extremely familiar with the intricacies of Magic, but often a quick question to someone who does know Magic can resolve it (temporarily I suppose). Otherwise, this is a game that is very much worth a few plays.

RATING: 6
Better than expected, but I was expecting little. The miniatures are decent for the price point, but the terrain is bland and the cardboard ruins are cheap and annoying. 

Rules are poorly written. For example, one of the black squads gives -2 defensive penalty to non-zombie units within so many squares of it. Does this also include Liliana? That would be idiotic but technically it is true. And putting the scenarios in the rulebook with a turn track and a tiny cardboard piece to mark the turn was asinine. If you pick up the book to look up a rule, you lose the turn track marker. Should have separated the rules and scenarios. 

Way too much luck involved with the dice. There should be more than 12 cards in a deck. So few makes it easy for opponents to memorize your options. I would have liked to see some instant and equipment spells. 

Thematically much does not make sense. The blue player searches through graveyards but not black?

Sorely needs a lot more cards and units if it wants to even think about being interesting.

Heroscape 2.0! Same ruleset, unfortunately simplified in a few ways, which is bizarre since Heroscape itself is fairly simple. There's just not enough expansions to supplement Deck and Army building, and it really looks like Hasbro dropped this crazy quick, so we probably will never see those needed expansions. The expansions they DID give us were great, however, and showed what kind of future this game should have had.

RATING: 6.5
At first glance, before playing it and after reading the rules, it appeared to me as the heavy dumbed down version of Heroscape... then I played it. It was worse than I imagined.

Important premise: Magic TG and Heroscape are two of the best games ever for me, which I rate both "10" here on BGG - I rate "10" only five games on over 700 I posses.

Let's start with the components. Quite good miniatures, although NOT painted and with low details (they remember me those of D&D - The Fantasy Adventure Boardgame). Not bad, but after seeing Heroscape ones... well, they are uncomparable. Planeswalkers are painted but... they are HORRIBLY painted (Nissa seems an orc, while Liliana seems to have a chaos-mutated arm!)
The rest of the components are frugally made; Glyphs and dice are BLACK and WHITE, remembering instantly some sort of prototype components and not real game pieces.
And finally the board... Ok, cardboard tiles are not so bad (also if art is quite poor) but the plastic tiles are a joke: 4 tiles. Yes, FOUR. Two 1-hex and two 3-hexes. It's pathetic in my opinion. I can't forget the opening of the first Heroscape set I bought in 2004 and the work (literally!) needed to put all the pieces again in the box after the first plays. What a difference!

Anyway, the worse comes with the gameplay. First: no Order Markers. Eeeh?! The game lose a lot of strategy without orders! Ah, but we have the simil-Magic cards here...! Sigh. The idea could have been good, but really badly implemented and - mostly - executed. Planeswalkers have strong abilities and some cards generate tremendous effects comboed with them AND you can play 3 cards per turn! They may appear so few... but 3 cards can be devastating! So in the end the card mechanic adds some more (heavy) randomness to a game that already possesses an heavy random factor by its own. The result is a more and more exponential, unpredictable game in wich some good/bad lucky moments can completely destroy the balance.

But the worst of the worst part is about Planeswalkers themselves. I remember the wise words of some very good Heroscape players suggesting by their experience to never create Heroscape teams heavily based on a single figure, because that's a very risky choice; some good rolls for the opponent could be devastating for a team losing its fulcrum character.
Now, here in Arena of the Planeswalker, if you lose your Planeswalker... you immediately lose the game! Argh! What kind of genius designer came out with this?! I ask to myself if they even played Heroscape once in their life! Now a completely suicidal attack can let you win the game suddenly. Add to this the fact that cards adds completely unpredictable effects (more movement, more attack and all sort of strange special things) and you can see the real weakness of the whole game design. All this sounds as a stupid nonsense to me.

In the end, I have two different final comments for this game.
If you have never seen Heroscape in your life and you know nothing about it, well, maybe you could appreciate the simpler and fast paced mechanics of Magic - Arena of the Planeswalkers (I'll define it as a super-easy entry-level for Heroscape).
But if you had the lucky to live the great Heroscape era as I did, you will compare immediately the two games and Arena of the Planeswalkers can't stand a chance. In this case, my suggestion is to retrieve some Heroscape material instead to invest in this absolutely trivial game.

For the price, this games offers some terrain and a lot of miniatures. I really like this game except for the dice rolls. A strategy is thrown out the window based on dice rolls. In the midst of this, the Magic cards definitely give the illusion that you are mitigating the luck, and that makes this one quite enjoyable. Worth the price.

Picked it up because of its pedigree. Heroscape has fascinated me since I became aware of it but it was already long out of print by the time it came on to my radar. Base game box is great value for the price (though the prepaints are awful) but the game is crying out for some expansions.

Definitely an enjoyable skirmish game and I can't wait to see where it goes. I can see it moving up the ratings.

I only played one first 3 player game at Essen fair "Spiel15".

It's more of a tabletop game than a tactical card game.

I enjoyed it and like to play again/more. But 3 player games seems not good because when 2 players fight each other then the 3rd player profits.
In our first game it was a lttle bit difficult to have an overview over all enchantments.
I like the rather simple but effective fight resolution with the dice.

I think I would have been faster in reading and understanding the card abilities if we had played the english edition because I know the MtG abilities by their english names rather than their german names.

I love heroscape and have played a lot of MTG, but I found this mesh a bit mellow.  I'm not sure random card draws is a good addition to heroscape, although it does open up a larger army customization space.  But more importantly there are not enough units to allow for much maneuvering, and most of the game devolves into just standing next to the other player's units and chucking dice until something gives way.  That reminds me too much of Marvelscape, which only redeemed itself by being perfectly compatible with Heroscape proper.  With 2v2, I could see the game being good, as there will be more units and more maneuvering.

1v1: 5/10
2v2: quite 6/10
as an intro to fantasy miniature gaming for kids: 8/10

update:  I also have had a good time playing this with my daughter, who gets into the game despite being notably below the minimum age for the game.  At least part of it is that the game includes 3 strong female characters, and she has latched onto two of them.  She can also grasp the basics of tactics, but we don't play with the full rules (or with spell cards).  We also play it cooperatively a lot, verging on an RPG.

14-09-2015. Rated after 3 plays. Magic: the boardgame is a fine game. It's a turn-based tactial skirmish game.

During your turn,
You draw a card.
Activate your planeswalker mini OR a squad of summoned mini's
Play enchantments to boost/hamper squads or sorceries that affect the game for a short while
You move and attack
Again play enchantments or sorceries.
Combat works incredibly easy, it's rolling dice for hits, defending model rolls defense. The residual is damage.

There are also some terrain effects. All in all, the game is pretty fun. It's very light, but interesting. I do notice that the game needs expansions to give it legs. I think as a basegame it's varried enough, but there is a lot  more to get out of this game.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With two plays in I'm giving this game an "OK" rating.  It's really really Junior Heroscape, with all of the larger-than-life aspects removed and much of the poor thematics of Magic replacing it.  I've played twice, the first game was awful and this second game harkened to Heroscape, but fell short.  The game also has an "every finish is close!" aspect to it that has felt disempowering.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a good game, but it stands in the shadow of a giant one, and begs the question -- why not buy Heroscape instead?

I find myself a little let down by Arena of the Planeswalkers, though that has more to do with the thinness of the content out of the box rather than the design itself. Heroscape is a durable chassis to build on, but it's hard to not feel that they put in the bare minimum into a core set. The license does feel a little forced too, so we'll see if future content improves it.

I never played Heroscape, which this game is a reimplementation of.  But I like the idea of of pared down miniature skirmish game with fun characters.  That's exactly what this is, a rules-light skirmish game using Planeswalkers from the Magic: The Gathering card game casting spells and summoning fantasy creatures.

In this game you and your opponent take turns activating one creature or group of creatures and casting spells until you accomplish your goals.  Each of your creatures has their own special powers and traits that vary the play of the game and the standard goal of a two-player duel is to kill your opponent.  The map makes things interesting too because there is water, elevated terrain, obstacles, and even power glyphs that give special bonuses when landed on.

I liked it and it is pretty accessible but unless it gets a lot more content I'm not sure of the legs on this one.  This set itself comes with one army of each of the 5 Magic: The Gathering colors.  The entire army is used in a standard 2-player duel and there isn't really room to vary things here.  Also, the map options are very scarce.  There are a handful of different ways you can configure the board with water spaces but it also only comes with two obstacles and 4 terrain pieces for elevating terrain. 
 Although you could reimplement pieces from Heroscape if you have them, the real problem is the lack of additional characters and spells.

Also, why wouldn't they just include a rules card or two and a turn track?  The turn tracks are printed on the same page as the scenario in the book and tracked with a little cardboard token.  And there are no rules cards so if you want to look something up you can't really use the turn track.  We just kept track of turns with ten-sided dice but this is kind of a stupid thing to neglect in the game.

It really feels like we're teetering on the edge of greatness here. With a few more expansions for more characters/squads, spells, and terrain, this could reach Heroscape levels of awesomeness. It feels very close to Heroscape already, but the addition of Planeswalkers casting spells and summoning creatures really takes things up a notch. I like where they're going, I'm just worried it will lose support before it gets there. C'mon Magic fans, notice this game.

Heroscape + MtG should be a peanut butter + chocolate sort of combo, but this game seems to miss the fun points of both. It lacks Heroscapes fantastic components and speed of play, but doesn't manage to get MtGs interesting combos and dynamic back and forth. Having to purchase (in games terms, with points) both an army and deck will make for awkward pre-game building if they release more sets. Why not have things driven by an energy system like magic?

Never played Heroscape but heard this game is a watered down version with a Magic The Gathering theme. That being said, without the expansions it is a lacking game. I like the premise but find some of the mechanics wonky like all the creatures are unique and your only allowed one squad of unique creatures. Doesn't really make sense. I do not have the expansions as I don't have anyone willing to play this with me. Unless you are a Magic fan and have someone that likes these types of games and also likes Magic you might want to pass on it.

My rating is specific to this base set.

This is Heroscape with a few changes.  Gone are the order markers (boo) and added in is card play (yay).  The disappointingly drab terrain, though, detracts from the experience.  I'd like to try it on a larger and more elaborate Heroscape map to pass proper judgment, but this isn't a super exciting release for anyone who has access to a decent Heroscape collection.

UPDATE: Unsurprisingly, this is much more fun on a big, elaborate Heroscape map.  It's also more fun with more than 2-players. (Or at least it is when you're playing on a big, elaborate Heroscape map...)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Have only played Heroscape once so I don't have a strong point of comparison there.

With that said, this game seems awesome based on my one play to learn it. Similar games that I've played (X-Wing, Armada, Mage Wars) are over-complicated with their myriad situational rules, long play time, fiddly movement, and (in the case of Mage Wars) novel-length list of keywords. This game strips all of that away and leaves you with a simple game of combat, plus a basic layer of card play. Much like one of my absolute favorite games, Summoner Wars.

Compared to Heroscape, the biggest improvement here is by far the board. I've personally seen it take over an hour for somebody to set up a Heroscape board, and that's just too long considering that the plastic board offers no real benefit over a traditional board. In this game, setup takes less than 10 minutes after opening the box. Plus the board has a nice look to it and has a better table presence than that cheap clunky Heroscape plastic.

The only negative notes I have are that the rulebook could be more detailed in a few areas, and the turn tracker is just printed on a page in the middle of the rulebook. This is incredibly cheap and inconvenient, so it will be immediately replaced with some other type of tracker.

I'm also really surprised that the units in the base box are all unique, so you can't use multiple copies. This is in contrast to more modern games, especially from Fantasy Flight, that encourage you to buy multiple copies of the base set. Arena of the Planeswalkers is actively discouraging you from buying a second core set, as the only reason to do so would be for extra dice and more options for setting up the board.

For $30 you really get your money's worth here. The game seems fun so far and I'm looking forward to getting more plays. Waiting to rate until at least one more play.

Update: After a few plays now, this game is still lots of fun. There's a good amount of gameplay in the box (five different planeswalkers, each with two different squads) but I'm excited to see what expansions will bring in terms of both new cards and new units.

So take a fun game, and remove 90% of what made it fun...  Still, $10 isn't bad considering HeroScape sets run for $300 now.

There are a lot of comparisons to "heroscape", and it sounds like there are... but I've never played Heroscape.

Coming at it from a mini's wargame enthusiast, I want to say this is probably the single best game for getting someone into the 'idea' of minis gaming. 

SUPER easy to learn and play. It's fast, which works in it's favor. It also has several missions to play, so if you don't feel like just killing your opponent, there is something to do. 

The miniatures are decently sculped. About the same quality you'll find with D&D minis. They are made of a rubbery plastic, (so if some of your minis are warped out of the package soak the warped bit in hot water then bend it to shape, and hold it until it cools). 

I will say that the paint job on the planeswalkers is... well... not good. Passable, but any experienced mini painter will want to re-do those paint jobs. All the non-planeswalker pieces are single color, which makes them easy to pick out who's is who's on the table. 

This is a solid model game, for entry level gamers, and a fun relaxing hex brawl for veterans.

(2 Copies: Personal & Talonz Gaming Guild)

As a long time HeroScape player and tournament organizer, I greatly appreciate this reboot of the system.  The addition of spell cards and the summoning of squads adds depth to the game.  The HeroScape dice have always been swingy, but the addition of multiple hit points to squad figures helps mitigate this issue.  I also appreciate the new win condition of killing the opposing planeswalker as it eliminates the "mop up" stage that occurred at the end of most HeroScape games.  While there are some bad planeswalker match-ups, the game plays particularly well 2v2 when a defeated planeswalker is allowed to continue controlling previously summoned creatures until both allied planeswalkers are dead.

While the components are not as good as the original HeroScape game, the price of entry is lower ($30 MSRP vs. $40 MSRP).  The shortage of 3-dimensional terrain is sure to disappoint many, but the new map boards only take 5 minutes to set up, whereas, HeroScape maps often took 30-40 minutes to assemble.  The reduced setup time makes the game more portable and easier to get to the table if you don't have a designated gaming area where you can leave maps assembled long term.

Although some decry the removal of order markers from the game, I actually view this as a plus.  In my experience, most winning army builds in HeroScape attempted to minimize the impact of order markers anyway (e.g., fielding multiples of the same common squad and loading that army card up with order markers).  Furthermore, without order markers, Arena of the Planeswalkers was able to eliminate the initiative roll that HeroScape required at the beginning of each round.  This is a huge improvement as the roll of a D20 granting a player two moves in a row at a key moment in the battle could often prove to be a deciding factor in the ultimate victor of a HeroScape match.

As with HeroScape, the lack of partial cover rules is one of my biggest complaints.  Being able to shoot a figure that is hiding behind a ruin with a full power attack simply because its hand is sticking out bothers me.  Hopefully, one of the first expansions will add defensive terrain to facilitate more tactical maneuvers around the battlefield.  Something similar to the shadow tiles HeroScape's Battle for Underdark Master Set would work well.

Production value is crap and what I'd expect from another Hasbro mass produced in China product. The boards have paper coming up off the links where they fit together, the paint job on the painted figures is bland and sloppy, there's no terrain differentiation other than elevation (it's all sand), and the supporting figures are lousy sculpts with no paint job. Even the ruins and wall bits are cardboard that don't align on the board. "But other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how'd you enjoy the play?"

It's Heroscape. Not "like" it, it's just downright Heroscape. If they'd made another expansion for it that added a new card casting ability to characters, these would be the characters with those abilities. Yes, it's MtG themed with a few mechanics from MtG like sleep sickness, but it's Heroscape... with crappy components. As such, it will be just as fun to play as Heroscape which is a good thing, and probably the best thing it has going for it. If you're a Heroscape fan, get it, it's probably a 7 rating for you on the low end. It's cheap (price wise) and when it goes the way of Heroscape, it'll be even cheaper getting blown out on the shelves of Targets and Wal-marts. If you're not a Heroscape fan (and you should know by now) then stay away, since this is just Heroscape in a different wrapping. 

Did I mention this is just Heroscape?

Oh, and if it weren't for the idiot savant Hoss Cartwright rating it a "1", I doubt this game would be getting so many "10" ratings. Hasn't anyone figured out yet that he rates games he loves a "1" just to generate the "10's" he wants for it?

While there's limited cardplay, this game is mostly "Magic" in theme rather than mechanics. However, the game is worth its low price, and likely to improve with expansions.

Used to play a bit Magic back in its earlier days, but it got too expensive around 5th Edition and I dropped out. My 4th Ed blue-white deck was amazing though.

Fantasy miniatures wargame. Magic leverages the planeswalker and familiar mana powered card casting and summoning elements into a hex modular battle grid.

[b]Another 3 players rule we use: [/b]
We play it so that when a player is attacked that player cannot be attacked again in the same round. This way you cannot be ganged up by two players and in fact force the players to distribute attacks to each other as well.

It's HeroScape, except for the lack of terrain pieces, painted figures, any variety of units in the core set, no order markers, and this has cards.

If I'd never played HeroScape, I would rate this a bit higher, I'm sure. It's going to need a ton more cards and units to be very interesting though. I have doubts the game will continue to get the expansion support it will need to get good.

Surprisingly fun game to play. I quite enjoyed it. It's also quite affordable at the time of this comment.

If there was any con, I'd say that while the game is stored nicely it's not well done and I basically took out certain parts in the box to make better room. 
Also I would have liked to see more content in the box, specifically for the spell cards(Well I guess everything) as there's suppose to be a cost limit to what you can bring to the battlefield so you have to budget your points to get what you think you'll need. At the moment in the base game it's functional enough that it can be played but there is a strong desire to wish for more in the box. There are expansions though but from what I heard from others that while those expansions helped they still wished for more.

But still this is a fun game worth checking out, and if you ever get a copy get 2 copies of it, it'll give you more to play with.

(rated as a potential kid-adult or kid-kid experience, despite the fact that we played a team-on-team adult game)

Fun, although the endgame condition (planeswalker death) made it longer than expected.  The factions may or may not be balanced, as my opponents were overly frustrated at my blue shenanigans.   This parallels the original MTG, of course, as it's always painful to have your attacking creatures unsummoned - particularly after they've been boosted with multiple power-enhancing effects.

As a historical note, I've never fully recovered from the fact that, in the original Heroscope, my kids mostly enjoyed building magnificent landscapes with the terrain tiles, rather than actually playing the game.  I own nearly every expansion, but I'm not sure that we played more than 10-12 full games over the six-year period when we were active 'scapers.

If nothing else, I appreciate that the set-up for Arena of the Planeswalkers is ten times faster than the original - which means that, you know, we can actually play.

This is a blatant knockoff of Heroscape while adding a little of the Magic The Gathering card game into the mix. Seems to me like it's meant to be a relatively cheap gateway into Magic The Gathering. Fortunately the units are still compatible with regular Heroscape. Just remove the summoning rules and the cards and you are good to go.

2-5 players customize the battlefield by designing the map, choosing one of five different Planeswalkers and moving their figure and unique creature squads around the map in a race to out-maneuver opponents and gain tactical advantages. Be the last Planeswalker standing to win.

I never really got the hype for Magic, but this board game version is super fun. A Heroscape style game for those of us, who never got to play that game

The game is very quick and, although I overall enjoy it, it feels like a single mistake can compromise your entire game. Need to play it more to be sure and, maybe, increase the rating.
Even if the base game already contains a lot of stuff, more expansions are required to do some army building.

Nothing really innovative, but a decent game nonetheless.  A bit limited in options without expansions.

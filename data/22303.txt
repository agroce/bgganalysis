Before I got Time's Up!, I was first introduced to this.  I didn't play with celebrity names, but played with a bunch of random nouns which was just as fun, if not more.

RATING: 8
see comments on time's up.  i found this game to be arguably superior because of the variety and personal flavor, but it can be taxing for people to create their own stuff and it seemed for us that patterns emerge where people were constantly banging on athletes, politicians, or some other trend.

The public domain version of Time's Up. Better because it's more up to date (in that the players write down celebrities) and may get duplicates.

(You don't need to buy anything to play this, just read the rules.)

Simply the greatest party game ever. I absolutely guarantee hysterical laughter and intense competition.

The core of the joy comes in the creation of arbitrary reference points over the course of the three times you go through the group's names. When those come up again in the charades and single word rounds, it's always funny.

We have found it helpful to outlaw references to gender and race in the charades round.

RATING: 7
Rating is for the free version we call "The Three Things Game", in which the players each write down three things, and these are the items that must be guessed.   Nearly always goes over well, even with people who haven't played it before. 

I don't have this one marked as "own" because I don't have a commercially packaged version.  I know the rules by heart and assemble the components whenever I want to play the game.

RATING: 7.5
Celebrities is the best party game. It centers on two mechanics that I find intrinsically fun: inside jokes and performance.

One game we played had Carolus Linnaeus; it was conveyed by someone visibly struggling to come up with a clue.

I love how the game uses increasing constraints from round to round in order to encourage players to pay attention to and remember everything that has occurred earlier in the game, creating a communal experience where players are rewarded for forming part of the community.

RATING: 5
This game has great potential but does depend on the players.  If you have people at your party who think an endless parade of Canadian politicians are 'celebrities' then you are probably playing the wrong game or more crucially mixing with the wrong type of people.

RATING: 6
One of the best party/icebreaker games out there, more so because the only required equipment is a pad of paper and a pen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the best parlor game.  It runs as long as you want (I like it with about 50 names in the hat [about 75-90 minutes], but any number is fine, really) and doesn't get cumbersome until you've got over 20 players.  Best with 8-12.  If you play it with fewer, they had better be close friends.  Play with these rules and you cannot have a bad time:

PLAY IN TWO TEAMS, NOT GROUPS OF TWO.  This speeds up the game and means more people are yelling out guesses at once, which is funnier than only one person at a time.

RUN THE TIMER FOR ONE MINUTE, NOT THIRTY SECONDS.  This speeds up the game and means if you get stuck on your first name, you have to flail around for longer, which is funnier.

WHAT'S THIS NONSENSE I AM HEARING ABOUT BEING ALLOWED TO SKIP NAMES?  That is completely bogus.  No passing!

NO 'SOUNDS' AFTER THE FIRST ROUND.  If you want to make a sound in the second round, that's fine.  It's your word.  You can say it (or sing it) a hundred times if you want but no more sounds.  No sounds in the third round, period.

A great game (the best game?) when you have an unlimited number of people who want to play the same party game, and you forgot to actually bring a game.  All you need is a pencil, paper, a bag, and a stopwatch.  With the right group, this can be hilarious.  I prefer having the players write out their own celebrity names to having the premade cards.

RATING: 9
One of the great party games.  I rate this higher than Time's Up strictly because it's free.  Time's Up is great if you don't have much time to setup, but you won't see some of the wacky names like in the freeform version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The party game that begat Time's Up - lots of fun.

So, why buy Time's Up? The pre-made cards cut a chunk out of set-up time... and the names are chosen so that there is potential confusion. (Confusion is a good thing in this game.)

Like Taboo, a party game that doesn't suffer when people have in-jokes or group shorthand-- trying to be clever usually just makes you lose, but if you pull it off, good for you.

SU&SD suggested playing a fourth round where you hide behind the sofa and cue things using only your hands, and then a fifth where you use only your face. This sounds like good fun but I haven't tried it yet.

Celebrities is a public domain party game that is great for energetic and friendly groups.  All you need are a few index cards to pass away an hour or two laughing your ass off.  This game is definitely not for the shy, slow, or timid - as are most party games - so your mileage may vary.  However, if you're into Charades, Password, or Taboo, you can't go wrong here.  It's all three in one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Never tried "Time's Up", but I seldom see reasons to buy public domain games.  Besides, if you provide your own names, you can tailor it to your own group.

I must admit, I'm a sucker for the charades bit.  The nice part is you already have a good idea of the names, so it doesn't seem impossible.  Still, seeing people jump up and down on chairs is just classic.

Quite a good party game.

RATING: N/A
[q="Summary"]Celebrities is a public domain game in which each player writes the names of celebrities (about 8) on pieces of paper or cards, one per piece of paper or card. The names are placed in a container, and players are assigned partners randomly (there must be an even number of players).

The first player pulls names out of the container one at a time and tries to get their partner to say the name on the paper by giving whatever clues they like, without saying the actual name on the paper. If their partner get a name right, they keep the paper; everything else goes back in the container. Each player has only 30 seconds. The names are passed to the next person, who repeats the process, and so on, with the names going around the table, and everyone getting chances to give clues and to guess, until all of the names are guessed. Teams score one point for each name guessed. All of the names are put back in the container, and a second round begins.

In the second round, the clue giver can give only one word clues for each name (with whatever other sounds or charades they like), and the guesser can guess only once. The round is played similar to the first round in everything else, and the names go back to the container at the end again, for a third round.

In the third round, no words at all are allowed for the clue giver; only charades and sounds (humming tunes) is allowed.

The team with the highest total score from the three rounds is the winner.[/q]

RATING: 3
Game in a Nutshell: A game of 'guess who' played in three rounds using the same celebs. Round one: say whatever you want; Round two: one word only; Final round: actions only.

Played as: Large group ~16 people

Pros: It might entertain half of your party if they're tired of real social interaction with each other. If you're playing this, at least you didn't waste your money on Time's Up!

Cons: Thinking up celebs to throw in the hat is often a drag. First round is so easy and dry that it's hard to convince people (me included) to keep playing. After that it's just charades; don't become fooled by the fancy progression of play.

Other: I would guess that I'm just not a party game type of person but after I went one round of this and like half the other people involved, was ready to leave, I think it's the game. Essentially killed the party.

Best Use: Maybe at a party where people know and see each other enough that they wouldn't mind the distraction.

I've played Time's Up but we found creating our own set of celebrity cards more fun.  We usually have each player add about 5 cards.  Index cards cut in half work really well.

My favorite party game.  Everyone writes down 5 or however many names you want.  They can be books, movies, celebrities, or whatever you want, really.  You put those words in a hat and form teams.  1 person draws, gives clues to get team to guess the word and goes to the next.  After the teams go through every word in the hat, you give a point for every one your team got.  The next round, use only 1 word to give a clue.  The 3rd round, act it out.  The brilliance is that everyone knows what is in the hat by that point, so it solves the problem I have with charades.

(I own a selfmade "edition" of the game. Basically just a lots of empty cardboard cards, pencils and 30 sec timer)

[gameid=1353] is the commercial version of this game. Game is simple and lots of fun. Having 24-30 names tends to take close to an hour which seems to be quite an optimum amount of time. Hilarious to play & to watch. I actually prefer this version over Time's Up! since you can play it anywhere (paper, pens and timer/clock are only things needed) and the unpredictable nature the selfwritten names gives.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The great part about this game is that in the second and third rounds, you have not only people's preexisting knowledge of the subject to draw on, but also particularly memorable events of previous rounds.

Figuring out how to say something succinctly / what your partner is trying to convey is very challenging.

--May2007-- Not quite sure why this is a different game than _Time's Up_; other than the self-selection of the "Celebrities" it's the same thing.  But, if forced to choose, I prefer this one to the productized version.

Love time's up.  My sister suggested this rules at a family gathering last year, she called it famous people.  Having each person write down names creates a list that is more significant to the group and names each player is somewhat invested in.  Really like that change from Time's up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played this at a team-building event. Catchphrase + ultra-Taboo + Charades, with a strong emphasis on collective memory (not just of the cards, but of how people thought of things). Can't go wrong with those 3, since I smoke asses in all of them. No need to own this; just need pencil and paper. But I do want Time's Up!, to entice those who need the visual stimulus.

3+5

RATING: 10
The most party of party games I've played. And though Activity is popular around these parts, the Taboo part instead of drawing makes sense as the game is faster and has a natural build up. 

edit: made slovenian version of time's up title recall (only slovene authors, man we don't know our own culture, mostly populated by 80s weird pop songs (pre globalisation era)). This is a great hit - even if people are doing badly in first round (trivia), they get up in second and third and the whole dramaturgy of game is just great. Public domain superstar. 

My version deserves a 10. Party game of choice every time. Deep interaction, double think, language skills, just a great game.

Great fun with the right crowd.  Superior to Time's up as you only play two teams rather than split into small two man teams forcing people to disappoint or frustrate their partner.  In addition the crowd dictates the "stars" so it becomes more personalized for the group.  Plus it is free.

I have to say that I would have enjoyed Celebrities a whole lot more if I didn't have a partner who'd belittle me with dirty looks and drop snide comments whenever I could not guess the right names.  To take a party game so seriously is just completely baffling to me.

With that said, I liked the first part.  However, since the rest of it involve the same exact list, it became more of a memory game.  The Password-esque round is ok, but I absolutely loathe the charade section.  Not only because I'm not a very expressive person, but also how long it tends to drag out.

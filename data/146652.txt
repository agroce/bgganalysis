Initial rating after one play.
Great thematic fun. Not sure how much of a game there is.
We played where one player became an alien. The alien cards were ridiculously powerful and tore the rest of us apart. But we did get to the last objective and see it. But then died.

Second game. Much more of a game. Played the same scenario so we knew what was coming. As a result felt less thematic and less fun. I'm kern to play the other scenarios, but some if the others thought it was too long.

Theme theme theme, it's dripping with it. Good components, the mat is amazing, and the game mechanics just thrust you into exciting cooperative and thrilling game play. A must have.

(edit to add)I have to say, the more we play this, the more enjoyable it is for me. Yes it is fun, but it is actually exciting and stressful. The solid mechanics really let the theme saturate the game experience. We especially love the times that we are certain that we are about to fail, and we manage to eek out a miraculous victory.

This game lacks depth. It's a light jaunt. If you want a hardcore co-op with atmosphere and decisions, get ghost stories. If, however, you want to relax with friends over a few beers while reminiscing about the alien movies then this might be the game for you.

My girlfriend hates the player elimination aspect, and I'm not too fond of it either to be honest. Haven't played it in 2017 and only the cool mat prevents me from selling it

RATING: 10
An excellent game.  Both extremely thematic and solid mechanics.  Organizing it out of the box is a nightmare (and I ended up with a copy with 50 cards missing; which were promptly provided by Upper Deck when I complained), but it is well worth it.  This has been a hit with everyone to whom I have introduced it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nothing wrong with the game as such, but it's just not my thing - very chromey and goes on for a loong time for very little to happen in terms of getting anywhere - it feels like treading water as you try to keep things off.  I know a lot of cooperative games are like that, but I really prefer Ydrassil, Pandemic or Forbidden island.  And for deck builders, I prefer Dominion.
Maybe I'd like the Marvel theme more and it would gain a point - but that would be it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like it better than Marvel Legendary, which I like quite a bit, because it's a better pure coop.  It's more difficult (though not by a lot from my limited experience), there are no points to earn and no single winner.  The Coordinate keyword adds far more cooperation to the game and takes away the feeling of being multiplayer solitaire (which I normally like, but is not a good thing for a coop), and I think makes it scale better with more players since you have more opportunities to play Coordinate cards.  My only complaint is that some of the images are a bit too gory for my taste.

Very tough, very thematic, very fun!

Only docked a point due to the shoddy way the cards were shrink-wrapped, and how much time it took to organize, along with reports of missing cards.

This has replaced Dominion for me, I believe.

Pretty decent for a cooperative game with player elimination (not my favorite mechanics).  It feels brutal and hopeless the whole time, and it seems like you really need to know the decks to do well.  Still, it was a good ride to ruin.  The theme is terrific and well-integrated.  Glad to hear they addressed all 4 movies!

RATING: 6.5
So this is an outstanding thematic experience if you want to play through the Alien movies. But it's a terrible deckbuilder.

Why? Well, the primary reason is that it uses a Star Realms style trade row -- instead of piles of specific cards a la Dominion, there are always 5 cards visible to buy, dealt randomly from a huge deck. This works fine in Star Realms and other deckbuilders, sure, but the problem here is that you're playing a cooperative game against a constructed deck that gets harder at a fast pace. So if good cards for your build don't come out, or the entire trade row is too expensive for anyone to buy anything for several turns, etc., you can easily get totally screwed by that alone. This problem is exacerbated with more players since it gets harder and harder to make every deck "good". 

There are other minor problems, like the way the card combos work -- every card has two symbols for possible combos, but if you mix and match characters instead of just playing the 4 preset movies over and over, half of those combo icons basically become useless. But really that main problem is the one outlined in the paragraph above: a curated and aggressively timed Hive deck is too hard of a match for a few bumbling space marines grabbing random tools out of a box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
1st play: I quite enjoyed this.  A refinement of the Legendary system, I like the exploration of the card rows and the sense of danger from flipping over the cards to see what happens.  The coordinate mechanism is cool, and allows for some interactivity.  It's not too difficult a choice, but it's nice to feel like you're able to contribute.  The theme is less awesome for me than Marvel, but the game is better.

2nd play: Quite a bit harder this game, and I ended up dying almost without any ability to react or prevent it.  I don't like when games make you lose without an ability to react.  In this case, I could probably have taken different actions to prevent it, but to do so would have been pretty sub-optimal (waste 3 attack points out of fear of a chestburster), and I took a strike that dumped my hand without any way to prevent or avoid it.  I still like the game, but not as much as the first play.

почитал правила, оказалось лучше, чем думал. ясная и чёткая структура игры, хоть начинай сразу. колодостроение по ходу игры, как в Громокамне. также постоянно нужно будет мешать колоду.

RATING: 5
My initial reaction was very negative. After playing the full campaign and playing each scenario multiple times I think I have a more clear view. My honest feeling about the game are "Meh". Its okay. There are no real meaningful choices, for a deckbuilder there isn't that many options to thin your deck, the game sometimes feels like it just chuggs along. On the other hand, those totally random moments that make no sense but are just epic are really exciting. That one in a hundred chance when you actually get a good hand and you get to do a lot of things to almost turn the game around, and then even with all your planning you die/lose because of a cheep card reveal wile frustrating is still exciting. I could take it or leave it.

I absolutely LOVE the Alien franchise and this game captures the films perfectly! The base setup can be very easy if you are at all experienced with deck builders.  Fortunately the difficulty can be cranked up more than enough by adding starting cards to the complex. Excellent for playing solo

RATING: 7
Αξιόλογο deck building game βασισμένο πάνω στην τετραλογία των ταινιών Alien. Μου άρεσε αρκετά η εικονογραφηση που σε βάζει στο κλίμα του παιχνιδιού. :) Οι κανόνες είναι σχετικά απλοί. Αρχικά διαλέγουμε ποια objectives θα παίξουμε. Ουσιαστικά ποιά ταινία θέλουμε να παίξουμε αν και υπάρχει η δυνατότητα να μπερδέψουμε τα objectives. Αυτά καθορίζουν ποιες κάρτες/εχθρούς θα αντιμετωπίσουμε αλλά και το ποιες κάρτες θα είναι διαθέσιμες για αγορά από τους παίκτες. 

Όλοι ξεκινάμε με ένα σχεδόν πανομοιότυπο deck και το βελτιώνουμε στην πορεία. Οι εχθροί βγαίνουν σιγά σιγά και προσπαθούν να φτάσουν σε μας. Μπορούμε να σκανάρουμε τις θέσεις τους και να τους επιτεθούμε όσο ακόμα είναι μακριά, αλλιώς τους αφήνουμε να έρθουν πάνω μας και ότι γίνει. :p 

Η συνεργασία μεταξύ των παικτών γίνεται μέσω του Coordinate μηχανισμού. Είναι ουσιαστικά κάποιες κάρτες που σου επιτρέπουν να δώσεις δώρο ένα σύμβολο στο συμπαίκτη σου επιτρέποντας τον έτσι να χρησιμοποιήσει το μπόνους ability κάποιων καρτών. Απλός μηχανισμός και δουλεύει ικανοποιητικά. :meeple:

Να προσθέσω πως υπάρχουν και variant rules για τους νεκρούς παίκτες να επιστρέφουν σαν Alien στο παιχνίδι, ή να υπάρχει traitor ανάμεσα στους παίκτες αλλά δεν δοκιμάσαμε κάτι από αυτά. Ακούγεται ενδιαφέρον πάντως. Επίσης μπορείς να ενώσεις το παιχνίδι με οποιδήποτε άλλο της εταιρίας και να έχεις πχ Alien μαζί με υπερήρωες της Marvel αλλά δεν μπορώ να φανταστώ γιατί να κάνει κάποιος κάτι τέτοιο. :shake:

Στα αρνητικά να βάλω την ύπαρξη player elimination αφού κάλιστα μπορεί κάποιος παίχτης να πεθάνει αλλά οι υπόλοιποι συνεχίζουν τον αγώνα. Είναι θεματικό μεν, αλλά δεν είναι γενικά ωραίο κάποιος από την παρέα να μην παίζει. Αυτό λύνεται με το Variant που αναφέρω παραπάνω ενώ αρνητικό είναι και το μπόλικο στήστιμο/μάζεμα του παιχνιδιού καθώς όλες οι κάρτες πρέπει να ξεχωριστούν. Κλασικό πρόβλημα σε πολλά deck building games. :(

Παίζεται ευχάριστα, ειδικά αν είσαι φαν των ταινιών και αναγνωρίζεις πρόσωπα και καταστάσεις.

The first scenario for "Alien" is quite difficult, at least as a 3 player game.  This is especially true during the first objective.  Unfortunately, this difficulty seems to come from the randomness of the initial draws rather than any real strategic or tactical errors.  It feels like the game is relying too much on theme and atmosphere and lacks worthwhile decision making.

I've now tried both Legendary and Legendary Encounters and neither has been a keeper for me.

The Alien Anthology in a box. Upper Deck delivers an awesome experience in this Alien themed gamed using their deck building system from Marvel Legendary. While it plays similar to Marvel you get a very different feel and the theme is far more immersive. It plays in about the same amount of time but due to the graphic nature of the artwork we wouldn't advise playing this with anyone under 13. 
 Really looking forward to expansions for this. Predators? Prometheus? Sure hope so!

Thematically wonderful! One of the few games of this "fight the aliens" genre that really gives a feel of the desperation of the endeavor. It helps that I like three of the four movies (especially Aliens), but the theme does extend to the personalities of the characters as played out through card abilities. Lots of variety in decks/replayability.

Seems like a jumbled mess when you first open the box, but then as you organize it and actually play it, you realize it's not...definitely an excellent adaptation of the Legendary system to embrace the theme of these beloved movies. Tense, frightening, lots of ways to vary up the play, whether you go straight through the movies or just mix and match objectives and characters. The added quirks like the 'Scan' mechanic rule, or the Chestbursters that get mixed into your deck when you fail to kill off a Facehugger; and there is always that uncertainty of what you drew from the Drone deck to mix with your Hives...amazing, really. I brushed it off at first but I am so glad I didn't in the end, because it is amazing.

This is a rating of a 5-player play, which is the least (but still) recommended player count. I'd risk a theory that a game for 5 is just not working. There is no deck building in a game that has deck building in the title. Throughout the game I've manage to buy about 5-7 cards, while in the deck there still was 11 (out of starting 12) basic cards. The small amount of better cards resulted in no single combo that I hoped to do. Deck building with no combos is like playing Talisman. Just do what the rules say and see what happens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Marvel Legendary sounded pretty lame when I heard about it, but something about the Encounters:Alien stuff just seemed to take a luke-warm idea up to something that might just sizzle.

Turns out that was the case.  I picked this up on a lark and was surprised at how engrossing this co-op deck builder can be.  Plus it is difficult!  

I still have aspects of the game to explore (like hidden agendas and a mission set-up beyond "The Nostromo") but so far this game is a bona fide hit that really evokes the feeling of the source material.

A side note:  I'm not a fan of the comic-book style art on the cards and there is much about the layout that could have been changed for the sake of clarity and gameplay.  That said it's not enough to take away from what really is a great time!

RATING: 10
This game never disapoints. Just for value alone I have played all scenarios more times then I can count with anywhere between 1-5 players, used every mode like the secret traitor/xenomorph players after death, and always enjoyed it.
But If yooour a solo player this game is a must own imo. I never even thought about solo gameplay before getting this but have found myself cracking this out over watching some late night TV more than a few times over the past year or so. 

Obviously you will want Predator too after this one just try to over look some of the questionable art choices :s

RATING: 9
One of the best implementations of the Legendary Engine.  There is a real tension and the game play makes sense.  Setup and cleanup are painful, but mostly worth the trouble.

The game is rated 17+, but I don't really feel the "theme" is so over the top to warrant that.  If you are willing to let your kids watch a PG-13 gore-fest, this game should be okay (it's no worse than a rick and morty episode).

Although I am a superhero fan more that an aliens fan, I cannot but accept the superiority of this game. The theme invoked is realised in a way more concise and fulfilling  way than in the Marvel deckbuilder, I so much prefer the mat vs the board, even though the iconography could potentially be made in a better, more  clear way. But this is just nitpicking. I so dig this game!

Fun deck builder with difficulty and pacing perfect for the theme. Coordination mechanic helps make this a Co-op game.

Would go out and buy a copy myself if it were re-released with built in sorting or if it went Digital.

It's great to have a game themed after the Alien movies, and this one does a great job. The art is strong, though I prefer the cards with painted artwork to the comic style. The game play is fun and intuitive. Legendary is a fantastic system, and this game can not only be combined with the Predator game for an appropriate crossover, but with the other Legendary games as well. Overall it doesn't vary too much from the other Legendary games; it gives a slightly different feel without straying too far from a proven winning strategy. I purchased Predator after just playing this one twice. you can't go wrong with Legendary, and adding more cards to your collection opens up many imaginative scenarios!

Initial Impression: This game is drips theme. From the moment the first card is revealed to the time that you're consumed, the game builds up tension akin to the movies up which they're based.

A better game than Marvel Legendary with a very cool story setup.  It loses a little due to a limited amount of balanced scenarios and a lack of the customization that its parent game shows.

Great thematic deck builder bit the swing of difficulty bothers me.

Sometimes it is very brutal and the next game it is nothing more than a cakewalk.

Nonetheless - Alien fans will like it very much.

It's Alien in your room.  Suspens, horror, strikes and death.  I feel the game is more efficient at 3-4 people (depending of team alchemy).  Rules are very simple, the theme is everywhere... Not perfect but very interesting to play.  I don't understand the size box (a lot of air) but... well... I don't play with it.

Great light cooperative deck builder. Really enjoyable onset of mechanics through the scenarios and really makes good use of the theme. This game only suffers in replay value for once each 'movie' is completed you can sort of work out the best tactic. Yes you can mix and match the sub scenarios, though I believe most people won't see this as an attractive feature.

[i]Posted: 5/9/16, Rated: 7[/i]

I like being open with you, and telling you when I want to like a game.  In the case of [i]Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game (LE:A)[/i], I'm a big fan of the source material.  Not in the, "I could watch this every day for the rest of my life" sort of way, but in the, "It's been a couple of years since the last viewing and I'm craving me some [i]Alien[/i]" way.  The first movie was hella scary back in the day although it has lost must of its punch: its effects don't hold up well to HDTV's.  The second movie is just pure awesomeness.  The third and fourth movies if they were to exist are terrible.

On top of all that, I've been listening to the folks over at the [url=http://www.dicetower.com/game/146652/legendary-encounters-an-alien-deck-building-game]Dice Tower raving about the game[/url].  When [company=517]Upper Deck[/company] released [i][thing=174570][/thing][/i] and it could be combined with [i]LE:A[/i], I was finally in for a copy.  Alien vs. Predator is a concept that was best done in the original Dark Horse comic books, yielded two execrable films, and some fun video games.  I'm rambling at this point.  Let's get to the game.

[i]LE:A[/i] is the first cooperative deck-building game I've played.  Right there, that's interesting.  This isn't just "my engine is better than yours."  It's "we're working together to beat these baddies."  From helping each other buy better cards (the "Sergeant" card), to killing facehuggers before they turn into chestbursters inside of your teammates, to helping them kill bosses, this really feels like a team experience.  The "Coordinate" action is the source of this synergy, and I really like it.

[i]LE:A[/i] does a great job of translating the menace and the fear of the movies into a board game.  Those alien cards keep flowing into the Complex, and you won't know what's coming unless you spend combat points to "scan" that room, or until it shows up in the Combat Zone.  It's easy to keep those places separate because the game includes a playmat -- finally!  It makes managing the experience a breeze.

The artwork on the cards aren't movie stills, but rather comic-like pictures of scenes in the movies.  And here is my first gripe: some of the cards do a great job of depicting Ripley or Captain Dallas, while others are barely recognizable.  The pictures of Corporal Hicks and Private Hudson do not look anything like Michael Biehn or Bill Paxton.  Since the movies were sci-fi horror films, some of the artwork is graphically violent.  Also, there could have been a greater variety of artwork used.  All "Facehugger" cards use the exact same graphic -- even the ones that go into the Strike Deck (how you determine damage taken from the aliens) or the Drone Deck (extra baddies that are shuffled in with the cards for each objective).  I initially thought I was missing a card because I didn't know what to expect.

That leads me to the biggest gripe I have with this game: sorting it all out.  I had heard how onerous sorting was, but I didn't believe it until I tried it on my own.  [b]The instructions don't tell you how.[/b]  They leave it up to you to realize that there are deck identifiers on the bottom of each card written in a smaller, faint font.  If you're thinking about buying this game, then be sure to print out [filepage=107161]this card list[/filepage] by [user=gwarjuice]gwarjuice[/user].  It's a tremendous help to organizing the game.  Upper Deck should have included this information in the instruction booklet.

[i]Legendary Encounters: Alien[/i] delivers a tense, highly thematic experience.  Its tension and gruesome nature means I won't be playing this game all the time.  I rather expect a few weeks or months will pass, and then I'll be craving me some [i]Alien.[/i]

(2-5 players, 60 min) The famous movie quadrilogy turned into a intensely creepy cooperative deckbuilding game. Play through each movie (or mix and match for new stories) recruiting your favorite characters as you stop the xenomorph infestations on LV-426, Fury 161, and the USM Auriga. Be careful not to get facehugged, or your life will become a ticking time bomb as the chestburster crawls its way to the top of your deck - and then it'll be all over.

Am a huge Aliens fan, so this was a no-brainer. And I love it, even though I've only played, and will most likely only play, solo. As far as deck builders go, it holds my interest far better than the likes of Dominion and Ascension, but then it's a world I'm familiar with. I would like to see more card variations for sure, especially those used to build the Barracks deck. and there's a rather large luck component with regards to the Hive deck. I was able to crush the game on my third try simply because the Hive deck played in my favor throughout. In comparison, a card I needed as part of the win condition in an earlier attempt was at the bottom of the deck, leaving little chance I would have ever survived long enough to pull out a victory. Still, what hope should I have of winning anyway? They're frickin' acid-spitting, face-hugging aliens for crying out loud! Game over, man. Game over.

Wow! I have gushed all over this one in other areas, but wanted to say something here in case you missed them: GREAT GAME.

Well done theme, mechanics, works wonderfully solo and is good and tense. My knee jerk is to rate it beyond the stratosphere, but I have long since learned against doing that, I will play more then rate, suffice to say I like it a lot. 

For those wondering YES it is different enough from Marvel to go and grab a copy if you like that one!

I find this game gets real good once you start mixing and matching random character cards and scenarios! Until I did that, the game felt kind of flat to me - it was as if all of the character's abilities synergized with one another so well it felt easy.

Love it now, but would play it way more of it wasn't a bit of a beast to set up and put away

EDIT: 

Eventually ended up selling. It being best at lower player counts lead to it not being played other than solo games, and I'd rather play so many other games solo. Plus now I'm not sure if deckbuilding is my thing after playing this and star realms

A great theme game, but an only 'okay' deckbuilder. It really depends on what you want out of it. If you're looking for a fun game to bring to the table and a good theme, this is great. I suspect this has really awesome 'anyone-can-play' potential to bring friends into games. But it also depends what you want out of it. I like complicated deckbuilders and euro games. This is not Trains or Puzzle Strike. This is Flash Point or Pandemic: the deckbuilding game. The game often plays you, but there are definitely important decisions to be made. Overall though, my primary feeling was that a whole lot of this game was really chance based more than any amount of tactics or strategy. For a deckbuilding game, this isn't that deep, for a coop, I prefer Space Alert or Robinson Crusoe, but for a theme-drenched entry-level game that anyone can enjoy? This is pretty good.

RATING: 10
Provisional rating, I need to play more to get a final rating, but so far looking really good.

I like the way the game feels different based on the objectives and cards you use in the barracks - very clever, it's like having multiple games in a kit in the box for you to build your own story.

The co-op element is strong too with the co-ordinate mechanic too.

Haven't tried the traitor mechanic (with agendas), nor the alien player, they'll certainly shake things up.

Overall, like it, a lot. 

[Update] played it more now and it gets better and better, now a 10 for me, want to play it at every opportunity :)

I like deck building as a mechanic well enough, but in the straight competitive games with it I can never seem to get things together because I hoard a bit too much.  But when it is cooperative like this, I love this kind of game, and the legendary system is an excellent system.  Looking forward to playing the predator version.

the rating of this game is raised by the theme. with another less magnetic theme, the rating were a 5. 

there are not so much real decisions to make (in fact, there are a lot, but all so obvious). the random factor is very high. there isn't a strategic planning.

as solo gamer, i think i miss some funny elements, like agendas or alien player. i think i'll try to make some home rules for include this kind of stuff.

So far, deckbuilding is one of my least favorite mechanics in games. I've disliked most I've played--there are some notable exceptions: Star Realms and Friday. I hate all the shuffling and setup. I like boards in board games! I strongly dislike the cartoony artwork in this game which I think is a disservice to its theme. The gameplay was tough, and it is a decent game, but it's just not for me.

Normally I'm not a big fan of pure deckbuilders.
Normally I'm not a fan of Co-Op games where you play multiplayer solo.
Normally I'm careful with games that recreate movies.

I was really happy with my Arctic Scavengers and I was fine with playing a round of Dominion with my spouse once in a while.
Then all of a sudden Legendary Encounters came along and I, as a big Alien (vs. Predator) fan, was ... interested.

When my replacement cards arrived (50 of the 600 were missprinted) I tried it...
...and fell in love with it.

Hell, yeah, I like this game. All the small details in the cards is so great. Fans will recognize so much...
And I was really surprised and happy as I scanned a room and unflipped Jonesy.

I am a bit afraid though that it might get dull after time passes by but help is on it's way. The predator box might cure that itch.

Nevertheless I'm looking forward to playing much much more of this.

Brilliant game. Very thematic and each scenario is varied. Slightly difficult but still fun to play even when you lose. A win feels incredibly satisfying. 

My biggest complaint is when you first purchase the game and have to sort the cards. Very confusing. But after they're organised, setting up a game is no issue. 

I usually dislike deck games, but this is unlike anything else. Fun solo and co-op. Any game that makes being killed by a cheatburster fun deserves to be Highly recommended!

Very fun and challenging.  The theme really enhances the gameplay and the four different scenarios actually have a different feel to them.  I highly recommend the game.  Unfortunately the card quality is poor.  Decks are not cut to the same size, so riffle shuffling becomes ridiculously difficult.  I don't know why publishers use cheap Chinese card manufacturers.  This is a CARD game -- the cards need to be of good quality!  Increase the price $5 and go with a company that knows how to cut cards to a consistent size -- PLEASE!

Sorting card the first time can be a pain for some (personally, I like taking the time to look at the cards, so it was fine by me) 


Note: 
I loooove this game. Played solo 4-5 times and managed to win 2-3 times. Played with people once and lost at one third of the game. 

Always willing to play!

This is a good game but I'm not sure if it's a great game.  It is highly thematic despite its roots in the Legendary system.  Really dig the scanning mechanics and the objective/hive deck system.  Brings out the flavor immensely.

Nitpicky complaints include the fact that this still has a long setup/teardown time, the card backs mimicking Legendary's are ugly for this theme and detract from the playmat, and the constant shuffling/rote tasks detract from solo play when running multiple characters.  

Still, overall this is a keeper.

The best of the Ascension style deckbuilders. Although, I don't much care for those, so I'm not sure yet if this is actually a compliment. But the purchase row, as opposed to stacks, is less objectionable in a coöp when order of appearance isn't like to swing victory to one player over another arbitrarily.

So first off: my boyfriend and I played through all four scenarios over the course of two evenings and won every one on the first try. Which brings me to my personal feelings on scenario-based games, which are completely arbitrary. 

So on the one hand it's neat to play a co-op game with these very designed challenges - having been an avid video game my whole life it is a familiar warm and fuzzy sort of feeling. And it's worth saying that this game would be nowhere near as interesting without the scenarios. They are much of the appeal of the game, and each one feels very, very unique which is really cool!

But on the other, whenever I complete all of the available scenarios for a game like this, I feel like I've "beaten" it and do not feel compelled to replay them or start making my own. Especially in this instance, where it's pretty clear that making your own won't increase the difficulty (which in the case of us beating all of them on the first try, is something this sorely needs to make me want to replay it). So for me: four games worth of content feels extremely slim for something so large and pricey.

I would be interested to try the traitor variant, which should make it harder and sufficiently change things up... but again I suspect I would probably only care to beat each of the four challenges again with a traitor. 

The alien player module is also a cool idea, but neither of us ever even died so I definitely won't be replaying just for that.

As for the game itself I'll put it this way: I enjoyed this more as a co-op game than as a deckbuilder. As a deckbuilder, there are very few options to prune your deck (it's basically scenario-dependent) and when combined with the fact that you can get stuck with a bunch of cards in the market that nobody wants it feels pretty lackluster compared to other games in the genre. An option to clear the market really feels like it should have been included.

But as a co-op the game presents some pretty fun challenges to overcome. The game is always engaging and there's a lot of tension - particularly around the scan mechanic which really hits that risk/reward sweet spot. The coordinate cards are a really nice touch and a great way to make you feel like you're working as a team. Largely this would be the same game solo, so it's nice to have that extra small mechanic.

I've mulled over the game's difficulty (or lack thereof?) a lot. I think it boils down to the fact that it seems to have taken the Ghost Stories route of difficulty where enemies can chain together in devastating and unexpected ways, but once you're familiar with the deck it's much easier to plan for. Though it feels a little better balanced here, where you can probably see a new enemy type and live to fight another turn.

I'll also say that I did not expect for the theme to be as engaging as it was. Once we were done, I immediately went and rewatched Alien. The cards and everything are very thoughtfully themed, but really the fact that this a game where the enemy is always creeping closer and you can never, ever dally is what takes it home. Even as a big fan of the first film, I tend not to care about licensed IP games so this was a very pleasant surprise in that respect.

So at the end of the day this is a fun game that I find hard to recommend buying. If you're personally not averse to replaying scenarios or making your own (even if they're not going to be more difficult), then sure pick it up. Otherwise... I don't know, maybe split the cost of a copy with your group and pass it around between all the couples or something.

As for me, I'm glad I didn't have to buy this. I got four games out of it, and at most I may get four more. We'll see.

Edit: oh and one more thing, but while I dig that this has the Star Realms-esque faction/alliance/whatever it's called in this one system I found its presentation poor - it was very easy for me to miss the ally required symbol on an ability. I wish they were visually separated into normal ability / faction ability like they are in Star Realms.

I think I like this better than Marvel, but I did like the semi co-op aspect of that one.  As with most co-ops, the game seems to play you.  Pretty boring, and the theme doesn't shine, but the mere existence of the theme makes it at least playable.

I've played this game 10 times and I still feel like I have barely scratched the surface of this game.  The artwork is great and I really like how all the quotes, missions and locations fit the movies perfectly.  It's too easy for 2 players but is ideal for 3 or 4.

Comments to come, but I just want to say that it's extremely unbalanced with 5 - WAY too hard, it makes no sense... But I admit it seems like a great coop with 2 or 3 players.
EDIT: tried it with 2 a couple of years after my first two plays, and we won 3 out of 4. Much easier - and much more enjoyable! Rating with 5 players = 3 at most; I don't want to play it again with that many players...

Nice deck builder with a good theme. I like not knowing what's coming and the cooperating aspect of fighting it off. With more than 4 I feel like the game can drag a little, especially if you don't have coordinate cards, just wait for your turn. There is definite danger of dying quick, everything could be fine then BOOM, face hugger, but that's realistic in the alien world.

RATING: 8
This game based on the movie series Alien, is quite a good co-op that has great theme integration and some fun mechanics (looking at you chestburster card!).  There is some deck building involved, but I enjoyed the moment in my first game where I realized that getting more money to buy more cards was actually not the right thing to do. The game can be brutal, but winnable with good play and good communication. The other things I liked about the game were how damage is done in strikes with differing values but the damage is healed that way too. On the down side, there are a ton of cards that are not easily sorted setting up or tearing down.

RATING: 7
One of the biggest gripes I have about the Legendary series is the lack of organization of cards at the initial break down of the game.  This is especially so with Legendary Encounters where the only distinction between two cards will be small print on the bottom of the card.  It took a while for me to verify that I had every card needed because so many of them look the same that they would get misfiled.

Legendary Encounters:Alien (LEA)... Legendary deck building games 系列中本人最喜歡LEA, BGG 在legendary DBG排名也是最高, 整體位於60名。我亦認為是 Alien friend 不可不試的遊戲, 此遊戲不是硬套了 legendary 的機制便說它好玩和不是硬加上了異形公仔卡便說它配合主題情景。整個deck building 過程玩家是經歷異形電影劇情, e.g. 貓出沒、救女孩、setup 自動機關槍、被出賣、在通風口打異形和見異后等等。更重要是整個遊戲可捕捉了alien 幼蟲吸面、附體 (藏於你的 deck 內)隨時把你成為他們的一份子的精彩片段。唯一令我有扣分的是 setup 時間長和可玩性不足。此game 我已經玩了八次及已完成所有scenarios. Solo 又得、多人亦得, 得得得。我給予8.5 /10 的評分。但今天我為何突然向大家說我已玩了很久的遊戲呢?  原因是....燈燈燈等....它在九月出expansion.  這是我期待到不能期待的。

I already liked Legendary, but this version, as many have said, is stronger mechanically. I also prefer the Alien theme to the Marvel theme, so I assumed this would be a slam dunk for me, and it hasn't disappointed. One of my favorite co-ops and probably my favorite deck builder.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A few fairly simple changes to the Legendary formula (such as full co-op, enemy cards staying face down until 'scanned' or about to attack you, the co-ordinate ability on some cards) make a much bigger impact than you'd think. The theme here is spot on - for example, you have the option to scan aliens and other hazards as they approach, and you can actually get impregnated by a facehugger if you're unlucky or reckless. In a stroke of genius, this is represented by a chestburster card being placed in your discard pile. When this card ends up in your hand in a future turn, well...that's it for you. Unless you or one of your buddies can trash the card beforehand, that is.

There are a few things I'm not keen on, though. The alien player (which comes into effect when someone is taken out by a chestburster - another clever touch) more-or-less plays on autopilot and is a bit too deadly. There is also player elimination in this game - a turn-off for me, but thankfully there are unofficial variants that address this nicely.

RATING: 8
Medium weight deckbuilder with emphasis on theme and player cooperation. The decisions are many times obvious to seasoned gamers, and can take a bit of time to set up, but when it comes to being enjoyable and tied to its theme, it's up there with the best. The wrench in the machinery are that the available card display can get clogged up so you need to balance deck efficiency with the need to see more cards, and I simply love that. It changes the game from a strict deck efficiency puzzle to a probabilistic min-max one. The other thing is that some of the cards are really cool and clever (facehugger anyone?) and that made me smile when I first encountered them. Lastly, the PvP option and hidden agendas variant, as well as the movie seanario progression, kick the package a notch up.

Overall, a very enjoyable and solid design, and one I will most definitely revisit quite a lot. Recommended.

+ Highly thematic and engaging
+ Easy to teach and with quite a smooth gameplay
+ Highly cooperative
+ The clogging up of the card display presents a nice twist
+ There is a lot to be explored between different movies, variants, characters...
+ Great components and art
+ Understandable rulebook

= Can have early player elimination in extreme circumstances
= Can be easy with 2 players (but you can take it up a notch with houserules)

- Can take  a bit of time to setup
- Buying it new (I didn't) results in a long chore of putting the decks together

Takes the sound mechanics of the Marvel Legendary game and puts it in a cooperative gameplay package with a killer theme. I love the artwork and the mounting sense of doom as the aliens swarm your team. Not as hot about the fact that a dead teammate has nothing to do but sit and watch.

RATING: 4
Too much luck involved with this game. Luck with the character draw deck, the hive draw deck, and your own deck. Other games have more mitigation for this like Mage Knight does. You can easily look at your character deck after losing and see all the "good cards". All cards should basically be good, just how you use them should matter. I found 3 players to be good for me due to the coordinate mechanic as 2 usually ended in failure. Others say 2 players is easiest, but from the play throughs on youtube and my experience I'd disagree. 4 players I have not tried.
Note that slimming out your deck as most deck builders do is very limited in this. Clogged up decks w/ low powered cards is more deadly than the Aliens. You play yourself. Also, don't see this as a non-solo game due to lack of decisions.  Not a very good game IMO. When you finally win you don't feel like trying it again. You feel like playing each movie/scenario until you win and then putting it away never to be taken out again.

RATING: 10
A Marveles verziót ismertem, és nagyon, de tényleg nagyon szerettem, mégis, annak ellen tudtam állni (ami köszönhető volt annak a szomorú ténynek is, hogy a főellenségek és karakterek egyetlen rajzot kaptak, ami a játékélménybe is belerondított). Aztán kijött ez az Alienes, továbbfejlesztett verzió, és nem bírtam tovább, beszereztem.

Egyetlen, két fős játék után azonnali 10 pontot adtam neki: egyszerűen ez a játék így tökéletes. Miért? Ha már 10 pontot adtam, 10 pontba foglalom:
1. A playmat (játéktábla, vászonból) csúcsszuper, mondhatni überfasza.
2. Végre minden más tulajdonságú kártya más-más, de csodaszép grafikát kapott.
3. Nem hiányzik belőle semmi, nem kíván kiegészítőt, így is tökéletesen teljes játék.
4. Fantasztikus antológia az Alien sorozathoz: mind a 4 film végigjátszható (persze akár keverni is lehet a dolgokat).
5. Az Alien-hangulat (és az ezzel járó játékfeszültség) 100%-os. Egy kis hátborzongató zene a háttérbe és néhány Alienke meg tojáska az űrhajón és garantált a cidri.
6. A játékosoknak van beleszólásuk egymás körébe (ez újdonság a Marveles verzióhoz képest). Ezzel nem csak a kooperációt erősítették fel, de ahhoz is hozzájárultak, hogy ne legyen holtidő, hiszen így állandóan figyelni kell saját lapunkat, tudunk-e vajon segíteni.
7. Egy másik újdonság: az ellenségeket szkennelni kell, amire újabb harci erőt kell szánni, ez pedig izgalmat és kíváncsiságot csempész a dologba, miközben meg is nehezíti a játékosok dolgát.
8. A sérülések nem szokványos módon érkeznek, az erre kialakított pakli rendkívül ötletes kártyákkal van ellátva.
9. A 16 különböző karakter (4-4 minden filmből), a 10 szerepkártya akiket megtestesítünk, a 4 helyszín (melyből minden játékban 1 van jelen), a 12 célkártya (melyből mindig 3 van játékban) és a drón dekk akkora változatosságot ad a játéknak, ami garantálja, hogy ne játsszuk ki pár nap alatt és ne unjunk rá egyhamar.
10. Mert egyszerű a szabály, mert könnyen megérthető és ennek ellenére mégis komplex.

Számomra az eddigi TOP1 deckbuilding építő játék amivel valaha játszottam! (És remélem ez a véleényem megmarad későbbi játékok után is, hisz mint mondtam, eddig csak 1 partin vagyunk túl... de holnap jön a következő! :) )

Tough cooperative deckbuilder.
It takes hours to sort the cards before you can actually play it the first time. Rulebook isn't the best. I HIGHLY recommend watching a youtube review before your first playthrough, this 'll speed up the first setup tremendously (especially since the card types aren't well indicated).

Apart from that: AMAZING game that oozes theme and offers endless variation. Highly recommended, but you need to get over the initial setup & sorting hurdles.

Compaired to marvel legendary.  It has more story, you progress through 3 mini stories.  Some of this sentiment may be movie nostalgia though.  More tension.  Part of this is the way cards are played.  Needing to scan to reveal a card is very suspenseful and the way creatures often are worse once in combat zone makes you want to dispose of them sooner.  In marvel often I didn't care if villain escaped, no real pressure.  The face hungers and chest burst card are very thematic.  You can still play as you are festering an alien, and still try to win before you die.  Set up still is a big pain in the a22.

I enjoyed this game the first three times I played it, but my interest has waned rapidly thereafter. The game lacks any sort of strategic element, presenting the same tactical challenge, turn-after-turn, of maximizing your recruiting and combat points. To my mind, this just reduces the game to a random outcome, relying on the order of card appearance from multiple decks.

RATING: 8.8
Legendary Encounters is an amazing cooperative deck-building game. If you are a fan of the Alien(s) movies, this is a must-have. The game design incorporates a number of improvements and refinements over Marvel Legendary. Each player has an avatar and a personalized starting deck. That's a nice improvement. I also like how the Hive deck ramps up in difficulty as you progress through the objectives. The objectives also provide some variety into the gameplay. Scanning to see what the enemies are is brilliantly thematic and adds tension to the gameplay. The ability to "Coordinate" is amazing and really adds to the cooperative nature of the game. It practically eliminates any downtime since you are involved on everyone's turn. The fact that the game is fully cooperative (when you don't incorporate the secret goals or traitor variant) isn't necessarily an improvement over Marvel Legendary, but it can be with the right group. Where the game suffers (compared to Marvel Legendary) is player elimination, unfortunately. It's no fun for your character to be killed and you have to watch the other players play. There are proposed house rules for eliminating the player elimination, but I haven't tried them yet. Having a chestbursted player turn into an Alien and play an Alien deck mitigates this somewhat, but only slightly since it's more likely that a player dies from strikes than a chestburster, and playing as an Alien simply isn't very fun. The game also currently suffers from the lack of replayability compared to Marvel Legendary's near infinite replayability. I just don't think it makes sense thematically to play scenarios that don't match up with one of the movies. I can't see ever mixing characters and movie objectives. Ultimately, I think I will get tired of playing the same movie scenarios more than a few times each, but, for now, I love it. It's possible the planned expansion could significantly improve the replayability. I hope so. As with Marvel Legendary, the game does not scale well with the number of players. The sweet spot seems to be 3 players. Do not play with 5 players unless you do a couple rounds of recruiting first. Solo play doesn't seem as well implemented as Marvel Legendary. The artwork is very uneven. It ranges from superb for the Aliens to rather poor for some of the characters.

The above comes across as more negative than I actually feel about the game. It's a really great cooperative and a lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A solid thematic deck builder, bringing the Alien quadrilogy to the table.

A cooperative game, this allows the players to work together to take on the iconic Aliens, complete the objectives from the films and try to survive.

I find the Legendary: Encounters games to be better than the Marvel Legendary game, as they're actually cooperative. Alien has a team of players fighting a common threat, Marvel feels more like individual heroes who happen to be fighting the same fight.

Alien also brings individual roles giving the players different abilities, a traitor mechanic and event the possibility of a player dying due to a Chestburster and becoming an Alien!

Would definitely play it, but I am more leaning towards the Marvel version.

After playing it I can say it wasn't bad, though the rules apparently had a bit of difficulty in their understanding. The time I played it the main person was a bit bossy and the deck seems somewhat stacked for their win, so it was a bit totalitarian. Still it was an okay game and I'd try it a couple more times.

RATING: 8
Atmospheric, wonderful game that, especially when you play the traitor rules, generates tense paranoia at every turn. Some of the best gaming sessions I have ever had centered around this game. I think it plays better with 4, in order to get the traitor in there.  Also, use the advanced rule where the dead players turn into Aliens for some real hopelessness. We had one game where the only ones left alive were a traitor, who killed off everybody...except one player who turned into an alien and ripped him to shreds. Imagine the table talk in this one!

A little bit fragile in combinations...probably best to stick to the correct scenario and character movie groups for best effect.

This game is simply awesome. It really has the feel of the Aliens films. Different scenarios for each movie feels like you have a base game and a bunch of expansions all in one box from the start it's great. Gameplay is tense and fun as hell. The only issue I had with it is that the difficulty is too easy for solo, but this is easily remedied by using the difficulty variants in the back of the rulebook, simply add more cards to the Hive from the start. Highly highly recommended for solo players, co-op lovers, and deckbuilding fanatics!

Coop for 1-5 players (plays well at any number, but is more difficult the more players in the game).
Game plays quick and fun, in 60-90 min. The problem is the setup and to put all back to the box: it takes a lot of time.
Nonetheless it's a good experience, specially the first game on each scenario with all the "plot twists". Afterwards, you know what to do but keeps being challenging despite the "surprise" effect is lost.

A tense game that is to some degree a puzzle: the players have to come up with enough attack power and resources/money to keep alive and to fulfill the objectives. You must plan multiple turns ahead. Hence this is also a very communicative game.

I'm a huge fan of the Alien movies. When I play Space Hulk I play an Alien game nothing else. With this boxe my appetite is fullfilled: I can play each film, I can mix the objectives to create a new scenario.I had a great gaming time this month, rewatching each film and replaying it the next days. As a bonus the difficulty ( always a problem in coop games)  can easily be modified.If you love the films it's a must have.
My only complaint: It'll be perfect if they have used photos from the films instead illustrations.

Yet another deck builder that has no reason to be a deck builder - no relation between theme and mechanism at all. If you like generic deck building, you like the Alien franchise, and you have no desire for anything innovative, this may appeal to you.

The deck-building aspect of the game is fairly standard but the theme is well woven into the objective cards plus the hive and barracks decks.

Only played the first movie so far (solo) but scored a fairly easy win - which is a bit worrying - was I playing right (UPDATE - no), and if so will the game have legs - UPDATE, I thinks so, getting better with more plays.

This surprised me by being really really good.  I'm not a big fan of co-op games, but this one hits the mark.  Not too complex or too abstract.  The scenarios aren't too easy, but not overly impossible. The theme is great, and the play has lots of angst.  We played it 3 times in a row which is always a good sign.  Thinking about buying it now.

Played this for the first time this week. We played the Aliens variant of the game. Made it all the way to the queen before we were smacked down one by one. There was only the two of us playing. It was fun, would do it again. We made some mistakes...need some better understanding of the cards and some of their descriptions/actions/use. Overall a fun experience.  Looking forward to playing with a larger group, where you have a traitor and others can turn against you.  Should be fun!

This game has some very nice implementation of its theme. However, the game mechanisms are not quite as interesting as some of its peers. There is also air if setup and take down burden. That makes it hard for me to choose this when I find Star Realms gameplay more interesting and streamlined. I don't know how long Aliens would hold my interest once I've played through all the scenarios.  So this game is a low 7 for me, meaning I'd always be happy to play someone else's copy, but it is an easy decision for me to not buy it myself.

If you are a fan of the Alien saga, then we don't need to argue, JUST BUY IT!
It's really clever how they tweaked the Marvel Legendary mechanics to fit the theme, it's better than the original and it oozes theme from all its pores: the feeling of dread and danger is palpable. You can choose to play any of the 4 Alien films, or an unlikely mix of them (although I never got past the Aliens film).
It is a deckbuilding game, where you will be upgrading your deck of cards as the game plays along garnering power to be able to fend off the xenomorphs and live long enough to complete your objectives. But awful things can happen, like a facehugger that could put a chestburster in your deck, and as soon as you draw that one... you're done.

Great co-op game and like the best of them, very difficult to beat.  It does seem much easier with more players at the table, but you definitely do not want to play the Alien deck when there's just two of you.  That deck is way too brutal for two players.

From the 4 or 5 rounds we played, there are a couple of hits - I'd say you're a bit hamstrung in which roles to play as you won't make it far if you don't bring the medic, and it seems the Barracks deck is far too random and needs some way of refreshing.  Nothing is worse than having a cost-9 card show up on the first draw and it just sits there all the live long day.  We house ruled this by shifting the HQ whenever someone had to reshuffle their deck and this seemed to work well.

This game is awesome!  It really ups the ante for Legendary, and it has some of the best thematic integration I've ever seen.  The game seems to run a lot smoother than Legendary too - I think it's due to the coordinate cards. The avatars are also a great touch.  Did I mention you can become an alien?  Did I mention you get an avatar as the alien?  Did I mention you get a big fat deck as the alien?  Oh yeah, you can have a traitors too and fight each other. A whole lot of thought went into making this a brilliant Alien masterpiece.  Amazing work here.  My favorite of the Legendary games, and probably my favorite cooperative game.

After a few plays of this, I can only say "Wow". As a big fan of the ALIEN movie franchise I knew I would get this, but I could never imagine a deckbuilder could feel so thematic, even after having played Thunderstone, which I also love. 

Legendary provides different game modes, great art and escalating tension as you can see doom unfolding right before your eyes when you think you have the Aliens and the objectives under control.

For now, the only thing that scares me a little is variery, as I don't know how would I feel mixing and matching objectives from different movies. But for now, awesome.

Same basic gameplay as Marvel Legendary, with a couple slight differences. It is co-op, with optional traitor mechanics. The play is much improved over Marvel, fitting the Alien theme well. The scenarios reflect the movies, to a certain extent. Each movie having it's own specialized cards, mechanics and personalities. You can still mix the cards and even add them to the Marvel version. Overall much better as a co-op game.

Mmmm. All the deckbuilding glory of Legendary and Thunderstone with all the blood and gore of Alien. Teens and above only, this game has some graphic artwork. Taken as a deckbuilder, its actually relatively simple. More Star Realms than Thunderstone. Slick as hell playmat included with the game. Great artwork. One of my games of 2014, and one I thoroughly enjoy.

Updated 4/20: Sleeved in Ultra-Pro black sleeves. Game looks *very* nice. Printed labels for the dividers, game is organized quite well and very easy to set-up/put away. Superior to Marvel Legendary? Probably at this point. It just offers more as a co-op, and can be played as a competitive coop.

What they’ve made here via the deckbuilding mechanism is a classic solo/coop adventure game. You fight bad guys, level up, then fight tougher bad guys until you either complete the game’s victory conditions or they wipe you out. The entire arc of fight-upgrade-fight while telling a story and applying appropriately increased tension is all here, and it’s all perfectly balanced and tuned. 

The key facet of the game is this enemy deck and track. The deck is made up of three tranches of cards that get increasingly harder (as in any good adventure game). Each turn a card is added facedown to the enemy track, pushing any cards there closer down to the combat zone (where they auto-activate). Events and hazards also come down this track and trigger different effects based on the location you’re playing (based on the movie) and the current objective card (you have to get through 3 objectives each game to win). 

You can spend your actions to scan (ie, flip over) cards in the track. Revealed enemies can be attacked. The events and hazards either outright hurt you or mess with your plans and provide a lot of variety for each section of each game in a simple and effective way. The facedown element provides a simple and nice fog of war and tension. The scaling works very well and by the time you’re in the bottom part of the enemy deck, you’re actually pretty badass. 

What takes it to another level of enjoyment for me is the way theme is incorporated into the game. Characters and situations and even quotes are made into cards. So you can actually have Jonesy the Cat or cute lil’ Newt as a card in your deck. "She'll breed. You'll die." is an Objective. Assuming you’re a fan of the genre, this works very well and all my friends have expressed delight flipping a card to find something memorable. 

Here’s one example of theme rendered well here: if you get a Facehugger attached to you, you have your turn and the next player’s turn to defeat it or you add a Chestburster card to your discard pile. When the Chestburster card is eventually drawn, you “suffer great pain and die.” You can become an alien player playing against the other players if you want to play that mode, otherwise, yeah, there is potential player elimination. Hey, you saw the movie; these things mean business.

I don’t want to oversell it. It falls in the light-to-medium category for depth of decisions but I find the overall package of depth, theme, and balance to be a great combination. They’ve hit on a rather simple system that lends itself to playing out a story very well. In fact, from what I’ve heard there are other franchises in the queue (Predator next and possibly Firefly at some point). If you're at all a fan of the Alien theme, consider this a must-have (or at least must-try). 

Caveat: the cards come all mixed up in a "52 pickup" kind of way. Print the card manifest from the Files section and set aside some time. I strongly printing custom dividers that several people have created.

I love, love, love:
- the nostalgia of the movies
- that I can play a full game of this in the time it takes to play the corresponding movie's soundtrack
- being able to play as the humans and as the Xenomorphs
- being able to play with hidden agendas, as in the movies
- the addition of a Chestburster to a player's deck if a Facehugger is not killed in time, so you don't know when it'll show and kill the player
- being able to play as an Alien player, should a player be eliminated from the game

I dislike:
- that, as with the Predator version, the pacing doesn't match the movies

Final verdict: As with the Predator version, but I'm not sure I can say which is the better game.

Let me start off by saying that this game is perfect for ME. So, if you are like me, you will love this game. If that's good enough for you, stop what you're doing and buy it.

Reasons this game is perfect for me: 
1. I am a huge film buff. I love movies, including the Alien franchise. Even the wacky fourth one that is confusing and weird.
2. I love challenging games. "Oh, we lost?... LET'S PLAY AGAIN!"
3. I am an gracious alpha gamer. I see all the best moves and know what we should do. In this game 85% of the time, there is a definite best move and a definite best way to play your hand. To make the game fun for everyone playing though, I allow mistakes, I let them play the game and I hold my breath. It makes it fun, cause guess what, if you're on a ship and aliens show up, you might make a mistake too.
4. I like 2 hour games. This game says 45 min... I haven't played a game in under 1 hour  yet, which I love. Great length.
5. I love co-op games. I used to HATE co-op games, now I LOVE them (good ones). I grew up yelling, fighting, blaming, complaining, during board games with my family because someone did something that hurt someones feelings... blah, blah, blah. So, co-op games for my family are a lifesaver.

Walk with me. I was researching games one day and felt convinced I would love this game. I didn't have the cash though so I called up my bro and told him to buy it... unfortunately, I knew he wouldn't love the theme or how difficult it was. BUT, what's this... Legendary Marvel. Boom. He bought the game one Thanksgiving and we all loved it. It was great. There were and are some problems with it though (for me).

Problems with Legendary: Marvel:
1. The bad guys escape and.... nothing happens. Most of the time it doesn't change anything and sometimes it can help you when the bad guys escape?! What? That literally doesn't make any sense.
2. It's a co-op game... that you're competing in? Why did they add those stupid victory points? The end game feels like this, "Yay! We won!" - me... "No, I did." - silly person who got most victory points... 
3. Because of the victory points, that changes what you buy and who you kill and thus fights can happen because "You're being selfish for doing that! Do this!" ... " But I want this..." "All you care about is yourself." This exchange happens often in Marvel.

Well, guess what ladies and gents. That's right. Legendary Encounters fixes all those problems with flying colors.

Things that make Legendary: Encounters the BEST themed game ever:
1. The enemy cards come out face down. Why? CAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THEM! They are running around in your ship and you'll only see them when you scan the room they are in. Genius.
2. When the enemy cards leave the Complex (in Marvel this is when the enemy "escapes") they come into the Combat Zone and you have to fight them. If you don't kill them you take damage and lose health. You only have limited health.
3. There are Coordinate cards. These make the game fantastic. The more players you play with, the quicker aliens come out. (It's math. Just trust me.) So, the game gives us Coordinate cards to help with that problem. The Coordinate cards really help with the teamwork aspect and adds another layer of fun.
4. When you have 1 health left, you're scared. You are genuinely fearing for your life. "Should I scan the room? What if I get a strike?!" "MEDIC!!! Someone heal me!"

Even if you die, the game is fun. Then you're rooting on your teammate and still advising on decisions. The very first game we played (which we played entirely wrong, which in turn made the game impossible at times. I'll explain later) was my friend, wife, and myself. We literally only won because my wife died. If she hadn't we would have all lost. But since she died, my friend got to go and he had enough damage to kill it. That was an amazing event that we still occasionally bring up.

At this point, I hope you are convinced. Buy the game. This is really the end of the review. But, for you who want to hear how you can totally mess the game up, continue reading.

Rules are important. Words are important.
Well, I read the rulebook and thought I understood the game.
I took the objective 1, 2, and 3 cards and shuffled them together to be our Hive deck. We also only had the # of Drone cards as # of people (It's actually the # of people x's 3). DON'T DO THIS! What this resulted in was 15+ games with minimal (like 3) wins. And when we did, it was SO HARD! We ended up having to keep the Main Alien in the complex for the whole game. Since we couldn't kill it till we had accomplished the first 2 objectives, we just had to pray that we would draw the other objective cards before we died. This was very hard. In the rules it says something like, "If the main alien gets there before the 2nd objective is completed, good luck" and that sentence formed in my brain the way I thought we had to play. Lol. I played many solo games to figure out how to make the game winnable. Then, my brother in law, bought the game, read the rules, and told me. Oh, my goodness. We have only lost 1 time since. So the game has gotten much easier. 

If any of you guys out there are wanting a tough, challenging, thrilling, rollercoaster of impending doom, I implore you to shuffle all the Hive cards together (with only the # of Drone cards as # of people) and give it a whirl.

A really solid game with a painful setup and teardown, I got rid of this mostly because I had other cooperative games that I was playing more.  I'd still consider getting other games from the Legendary system, and thought Alien Legendary did a great job of capturing its theme with the deck building mechanism, but it just wasn't seeing the table, so on the chopping block it went.

RATING: 5
Two plays.
I really like this one. Excellent use of Alien franchise and it's integrated really well into the game mechanics. Seems like aliens come out fast at the beginning and you're caught without good strike ability, but in my first game things eventually worked out to enable a win even after two player deaths. Love how the objectives and events escalate as the game goes on too. You think you've got it under control and then things turn to hell again very quickly.

I think there are cards that let you kill cards in your deck but I didn't see any and wish there were opportunities to do that. But still, it works pretty well without it.

Looking forward to playing with more options :)

Update 10.3.2016
Downgraded. The theme and co-op play are great but each turn practically plays itself, and there's not really any opportunity to get cards out of your deck. Traitor element sounds interesting but dunno if it will save this game.

As with the base game of Legendary, a really good idea but execution is poor.

This particular set of stand alone cards is based upon the four alien movies, but uses the same mechanics of the legendary game. 

The little symbols upon the cards that are needed to kick off the special abilities of card you play later in the turn are simply too small, and frankly quite irrelevant. The majority of the aliens are 3-4 strength to kill which can be achieved very easily. The river of cards you can buy into your deck seems to be full of repeat cards so essentially you build a one trick pony deck. i.e. it does this and this alone. YAY :shake:

The coordinate is a nice mechanic. I can play coordinate cards in other players turns to give then the buying power or damage from the card and then draw a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement you draw is generally not going to be as good as the coordinate card you played therefore you jeopardise your own turn.

Agh, there's not enough words to say how awesome this game is. It probably helps it along that I'm already a fan of the whole of the Alien franchise. But it's very, very thematic and the mechanics always go off without a hitch. After a year, though, it does seem to be losing a bit of it's shine and replayability.

2 plays at five players. 1st game total party killed after 4 or 5 player turns. That is about one cycle thru deck... Game 2 2/5 character again eliminated early ~ player turn 5 or 6.. so they got to sit and watch while the others 3 played for another 25-35 mins. 

This co-op is super difficult with 5 players and has (very common) player elimination not a mix of fun in my book. If the game was shorter or there was more difficult player elimination this game would be fun. Why yes the alien movies are brutal and most people die... a lot. but I don't want to watch someone play a game for 30 mins. I want to play a game for 30 mins.

This is a fantastic co-op deckbuilder. The mechanic of how you need to scan rooms for aliens is very fitting, as well as sometimes you don't actually want to scan the rooms in case you reveal soemthing awful. It's brutally hard with 5 but it also adds new cards that allow people to help out of turn if they have cards in their hand that match.

This is the ultimate deck-building game IMO.  It's fully cooperative, and the group truly feels like it is struggling together to stay alive.  It is this difficulty that keeps the tension and interest up, but the game also gives you several options for lowering or raising the difficulty as needed to match your mood.

I also have to say that, like Friday, this is an excellent solo deck-building game as long as you're willing to manage two player decks as this game does not work well with just one player deck.  In fact, the players' greatest strength (coordinating) doesn't exist with just one player deck.

Finally, I highly recommend investing in some good dividers.  Justin Hiltz produced an excellent set that I happily paid a local printer $30 to print on high quality, glossy card stock and it helps greatly with the setup and breakdown times, which can be daunting, but very worth it.

RATING: 6.9
Jópofa, erőteljesen hangulatos pakliépítés. A setup mondjuk fájdalmas, de ha mindenki képben van, akkor gyorsan megvan munkamegosztással. A pakliépítés részben nincs talán akkora mélység, mint mondjuk egy dominionban (vagy akár ascensionben), de a hangulat és a koop jelleg kárpótol. Az ellenfél körében kitehető kártyák, nagyon jó ötlet. Jók még a filmek szerint összeállítható tematikus sztorik is. Elsőre azt gondoltam, hogy kétséges, hogy mennyi újrajátszhatóság van benne, de végülis minden filmet le lehet tolni legalább kétszer-háromszor és még random is megér pár próbát. Így már 10-20 party körül járunk, ami nem kevés, mégha akkor eladásra is kerül.
Ja, és grafika közel se olyan szörnyű, mint a képekről sejteni lehet, sőt inkább stílusosan jól néz ki.
7.8

A harmadik filmet is kipróbálva, kicsit árnyalódott a véleményem. Nem teljesen értem, hogy mi értelme van ténylég megcsinálhatatlanul nehéz coop játékokat csinálni. Ez így tényleg húzok egy lapot és ha a piros ász nyertem, ha nem akkor vesztettem szint.

Strong thematic cooperative deck-builder.  The hidden cards in the complex add a sense of dread of what's coming and the events and hazards add challenges.  Uses similar mechanics to Legendary:Marvel, but adds unique twists which fit the theme well.

This is fast becoming one of my favourite deckbuilders, the theme is excellent, the movies are perfectly realised and the rules and actions very thematic.

It is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor Legendary Marvel.

Even replaying the same movie never feels old or boring

There are enough setup variants to give it life of it's own away from just replaying the movies all the time

I was expecting an extremely thematic deckbuilder along the lines of Thunderstone (which was my impression after reading about the slowly advancing enemies before bursting through). What I got was an often (but not always) thematic deckbuilder along the lines of Ascension. I'm not a fan of the Ascension system as a whole. It was some fun when I first got the app and played a bunch of games, but became quite stale once you tire of the luck of the draw and the "most expensive card is the best" deterministic draft. Legendary Encounters: Aliens is a better game than Ascension as the theme does come through much better. However, it is still just a deckbuilder with card effects that serve the constructs of the game more than the establishment of a narrative. Again, that's fine, but it didn't meet the expectations I had built up based on the reviews of others. Still, I think it's a fine game and it's nice to have a co-op of this sort. There's a good amount of tension that is built up. But at the end of the day the game is still weighted heavily on luck of the draw, and playing your cards down pretty much determines which alien you can kill and what you can buy. There's very little thinking behind it. There are little moments for ingenious play, and so I appreciate that. If that aspect wasn't there, I would have probably rated this the same as Ascension.

Świetna i niesamowicie klimatyczna gra! Wiele kombinacji, regrywalność, wiele scenariuszy (+10 do klimatu jeśli ktoś oglądał filmy i zauważa ciągle nawiązania). Alien powinien być wzorem dla innych planszówek, jak można przenieść treść i klimat filmu z ekranu telewizora na papier w formie planszówki. Po prostu nic dodać, nic ująć. Gra dostarcza wielu emocji, można faktycznie poczuć się jak jeden z bohaterów, ekscytująca presja jest wyczuwalna, a tryb coop się sprawdza. Plus również za nieprzewidywalność, bo nigdy nie możemy być do końca pewni zwycięstwa. A przegrać można będąc nawet jedną turę od wygranej... co tylko zachęca do dalszych prób. Myślę też, że nawet wielokrotne rozgrywanie jednego scenariusza nieprędko się znudzi, a to przez możliwość modyfikacji poziomu trudności. Jednym zdaniem - naprawdę świetna pozycja.

It's a bit different then regular Legendary. I like it a lot. There's more to think about in this one, and a little more going on under the hood. The thing I didn't like at all was all the sorting of cards, and then every time you need to put things back in their place. I eventually traded it for a friend's copy of Euphoria since he loves Legendary and I have a lot of Legendary games, and really enjoyed the play of Euphoria he and I did. He had won the Euphoria game during our 10 x 10 game playing in 2014.

INITIAL IMPRESSION

Team deck builder game. I've become less impressed by deck building games over the years but this one has a nice coop element to it.

The coordinates seem very important to getting symbol synergies going. The encounters are pretty challenging but there is a decent amount of RNG in it and also your own deck that you build since "trashing" seems to be a premium in this game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love, love, love that this is a fully cooperative game, unlike Marvel Legendary, but the theme doesn't engage me nearly as much. So, despite the abomination that is semi-cooperative gameplay, I continue to prefer the original.

Edit: I still love that this is fully cooperative, but I haven't had the urge to get it to the table in ages. I didn't even know that an expansion came out for it last year. I adjusted my rating slightly downward as a result.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Though the mechanics smartly reproduce the feel and themes of the films, the overall game play felt insipid and far too easy. Despite the illusion of choice, the right course of action at any given moment was usually obvious and I never felt the need to strategize about better approaches to a scenario. Losses always felt like the result of the various decks being stacked against me.

Note: Most often played solo with three hands--any more felt cumbersome--and 4/5 cards in the complex to start.

The more I play this the more I appreciate how thematic and tense the game is. Have only played solo as multiple characters but love it. It provides an amazing solo experience. Haven't got close to the 45 minute recommended play time yet. A game is usually taking just under 2 hours for me.

Played the Alien scenario twice.  First game, I decided to stop as a facehugger laid an alien in my character, and the Chestburster card was going to come out soon.  This happened within about 15 minutes!

Second game, I managed to finish the scenario.  It wasn't too hard, and I've definitely learned that this is a different sort of deckbuilder.  Deck thinning is tough to do, but I should have tried doing it somewhat early on.  

Wow. I used the card randomizer posted in the forum section for my third game and had an amazing experience. This game drips with Alien theme. The deck building gameplay absolutely blows away Dominion. I am so impressed!

1. Rated this game a 9 after the first play. This rating may go down after repeated plays and concerns about becoming stale with the current mix of cards.
2. Theme really shines in this game

THE BAD: 
1.HATED the sort after opening, beginners or first time players of a deck builder are going to put it back in box and drop it off at goodwill.

2. Rule book could of been better (this can be said about a lot of rule books though). This goes along with #1: no explanation of sorting the decks out.

3. could they make the print any smaller for the different decks/objectives?

This is such a solid deck builder! It’s seems to get a bit harder with more people.

RATING: 8
Very well done, with lots of tension that definitely builds up over the course of the game. Certainly feels like Aliens, thematically.

As a cooperative game, it works much better than the original Legendary. The original had almost no ability for the players to actually work together, so whether or not you beat the Villain was not based on how the team worked together. But here, with the new Coordinate mechanic, you have lots of opportunities to feel like you are working together. The decisions aren't as much of a puzzle as other coops like Pandemic, but you still get the feeling of cooperating.

We've stopped using the secret roles, though. Being evil is just not very fun or interesting, as you don't have many options to undermine the rest of the party.
Being the Alien player is fun, though.

Initial 2 playthroughs are awesome! If you like the aliens movies and the legendary deck building mechanic, there is no way you won't like this game! Very heavy theme! Vice versa, if you don't like previously mentioned stuff, you won't like this game. Only qualm with thus game was none of the cards were packed separated and I, as well as others, have had missing cards. Side note, upper deck is apparently really good about replacing missing cards, just save your receipt! (they are! No receipt needed, great customer service)

More playthroughs and the game is still going strong with some negative things that though are present, I would not change. If someone gets an alien buster or gets a 5 damage early in the game, there experience ends rather shortly. It matches greatly thematically though. Its hilariously watching someone get impregnated, then explode xo. 

The scout and medic I feel are some of the best roles to play. Maybe to good... I recommend alien and alien resurrection as the best scenarios. Wasn't a big fan of the second one because lack of deck reduction, I have not played the third scenario yet. the first scenario is best for beginners

Rating after one play (which the group won).
New record in unused space in a box. The cards only fill about a quarter of the box! Upper Deck must have planned a lot of expansions to fill it up.
I've got also over 50 cards with no purpose (back is printed on both sides), why did the publisher do that? There are dividers delivered, so those cards are not meant to be dividers. Print out the help sheet in the Files section to sort cards when you open the box and prepare your first game. So far I am only missing one card, so the game is playable. Bought this game in Essen 2014, too sad that there was not a single promo card for this game.
Just for the designers, I would rate this game higher, but for the mediocre job by the publisher, 7.5 must do it.
Edit: upgraded my rating a bit after second play to 7.8

 I just wished that there is a real expansion For this game ( increasing replayability ) as it is cool and there is so much space left in the box.

Seems to be a bit easier with fewer players.
Most games are close and seem to go down to the wire.
Edit after playing a few different Legendary games: Play as a single player nad they seem virtually impossible to lose, ramp up the group size and you ramp up the dificulty rating exponentially. Add in the random nature than can not be overcome with skill and it all makes for a very frustating experience. Dropped from an 8 to a 5.

The theme and feel of this game is superb.  You are able to play through all 4 Alien movies and each one feels distinct and different from the others, with all the places and characters you know and love from the films.  The game itself is great, with the Aliens relentlessly overwhelming the players, and rarely will you win a game without also being on the verge of losing.  The artwork on the cards veers from good to excellent and the ability to mix up the objectives and characters from the different movies adds endless replay value.

As far as the Legendary system goes, this is probably the best iteration of it.  The variants that come in the box (hidden objectives, Alien players) add quite a bit of versatility, which is a very good thing.  Still, the linear gameplay, the randomness of cards becoming available for purchase, and the lack of gripping story makes this just good, not great.

I am not a fan of Legendary not really a fan of deck builders, but this game is a huge improvement from Legendary.  Theme is paramount, the plot of the game literary follows the story's of the 4 movies to a tea, and the mechanics of the game fit perfectly in with the theme.  Face huggers, the Queen, Jonesy, Ash, Burke, Bishop, all worked into the game in interesting and thematic ways, that make sense.  With just enough randomness, each time you play, things happen in different and interesting ways.  Recruiting cards is strategic as there are powerful combos that you can try to put together. 

This is simply the best co-op game I know of, hands down.  Players must work together and play cards that help other players.  Play is tense and interesting.  You can even play with a trader, or as an Alien with the optional rules.  Tons of replayability with the 4 different movie decks and the 16 character decks which could be mixed together for all kinds of wild adventures.

I played this game with 2 players that are not even fans of the movies (one had never even seen them) and they liked it so much we played twice more after the first game.  

If you are fan of the movies this is a must have, even if your not and you like deck building or Co-op you have to give it a try.

A pakliépítés neve: Halál
Baráti társaságban sikerült kipróbálnom a játékot, ahol is szétrobbanó mellkassal végeztem a padlón. :) 
Nagy kedvencem a filmsorozat minden része (igen, még a 3. és 4. epizód is), így nagy kedvvel fogtam neki a játék megismerésének (örök élmény, amikor kedves amerikai barátainknak elmondtuk, hogy is került fordításra az első 3 film címe szóról szóra, és a reakció: whaaaaaaaat?). Természetesen itt sem feltétel a filmek megnézése, azonban rengeteget ad a játékhoz (úgy érzem, tipikusan rajongók részére készült játékról van szó). Na meg nem is olyan nagy ügy 3-4 jó film megtekintése a megszokott szappanoperák és híradó helyett. :)
Alapvetően a 4 film története elevenedik meg a kártyákon, miközben a játékosok az életükért küzdve próbálják megoldani a különböző feladatokat. Kártyáink kijátszásával új karaktereket toborozhatunk vagy sérüléseket okozhatunk saját körünkben (plusz egyéb hatások is segíthetik túlélésünket). Egyes kártyák lehetővé teszik segítségnyújtást más játékos körében is. Ezek kiemelt szerepet játszanak, mivel a játékos köre végén eldobja a megmaradt lapjait és mindig új „kezet” húz fel (összesen 6 lapot), tehát egyes nehéz feladatokhoz/ellenfelekhez bizony segíteni kell egymást.
Alapvető taktika az Őrmester beszerzése (klasszikus magyar szinkronban: „Nézz meg a szemfenekem!”, máig nem tudom elfelejteni.
A karakterek közül eddig leghasznosabb számomra a gyógyító képességű volt, szó szerint életeket tudsz menteni vele.
Mint minden pakliépítős játéknál, itt is minél jobban megismered a lapokat, annál jobb paklit építesz fel, jobb kombinációkat használsz és ennek megfelelő lapokat vásárolsz.
A játékban annak nehézségét szabályozhatod (normál módon is kihívás a küldetés teljesítése), a filmek végigjátszása mellett a későbbiekben keverheted a helyszíneket, küldetéseket, karaktereket kényedre-kedvedre. Sőt érdemes kipróbálni a full Ripley paklival való ténykedést is (bár azzal eddig egyetlen egyszer sem sikerült nyernem – mire szépen „muzsikálni” kezdett a pakli, egyszerűen kihaltam a pályáról).
Sokak számára furcsa lehet, hogy egy társasjátékot szólóban játszol, de ez arra is alkalmas, sőt nagyon kellemes tapasztalat, így magányos farkasoknak is bátran ajánlható.
Játszható áruló humán karakterrel is, valamint akár egy idegen harcost is irányíthatunk a játék során a többiek életének megnehezítésére.
Ha van kedved, háttérzenének hallgasd az adott film zenéjét. Külön élmény!
Itt már várom a kiegészítőt is az új karakterekkel, esetleg a Prometeus küldetéssel.

It is vastly more thematic than I thought it would be, which admittedly isn't saying much--an army of grunts, specialists, and the crew of the Nostromo killing a bunch of aliens isn't exactly consonant with the film. Arguably the game makes no sense except for Aliens, but whatever.
It's vastly too easy solitaire, so I'd be interested in seeing it with more.

I like deckbuilders in general, and this one has some interesting twists. The board/playmat is a little busy, with lots of things to track. However, I was very surprised by how thematic this game felt. As a huge fan of the property on which it is based, I loved the way playing it felt. Different sets of cards really provide different feelings of play, much like the movies on which they are based. This really demands to be played with people who love deckbuilding games and also love the Alien movies. Without really liking both of those things, I could see this falling a little flat. I happen to be in that core audience, but my suspicion is that I would end up enjoying this a lot more than most of the other people I would get to play it with.

RATING: 4

This is my biggest disappointment in 2015. Not just boardgame disappointments but like, this might be the worst thing that happened to me this year in general. This game is awful.


Pros:

- The artwork is gory and over the top and I'm a big fan. I'm really glad they didn't use stills from the movie as this always comes off as cheesy and reminds me of the sad games I used to play in the 80's.

- The game comes with dividers to section out the cards. They're just plain Jane and have no artwork or titles on them but still, that's pretty cool.

- LE: Alien does invoke a sense of urgency but it's not thematically integrated as well as Arkham Horror nor does it induce as much panic as the better State of Siege games.

- ......yeah that's all I can think of. Okay get ready because this next part is going to be pretty big.

Cons:

- The game comes in a big box that is about 50% air. You can sleeve all your cards and they occupy the better part of one side of the box. I initially thought that this was to accommodate the multiple expansions coming out but I hear more rumours of new Legendary Encounter stand alone games than I do expansions for existing games.

- The setup and tear down of this game takes too long for what it's worth. There is a lot of shuffling different decks together before you start the game and separating decks after the game is over. And remember that oversized box? Once you take out the required cards you need for your game, the cards remaining in the box seem to slip and slide under the cheap foam dividers which infuriated me to no end. Setting up, organizing and tearing down is a game unto itself.

- I take issue with this labeling itself as a deckbuilder as this is more of a card drafter. You start the game with 13 cards, 12 of them being shitty 1 point cards and you're stuck with them for the rest of the game. Options do come up during the game to get rid of a card but these are few and far between and I only mention it to appease the defenders of this game. So there's no deck pruning mechanism which takes a good amount of control away from you in terms of building your deck. Secondly, you buy cards and place them in your deck but these cards tend to be the same ten cards over and over with a rare popping up now and then. It's a very boring and constrictive mechanism.

- There is barely any player interaction. You play cards from your hand and if another player decides to, he can play a card during your turn that says "Coordinate" to add the points on that card to your point total.

- There is no tough decision making. There are choices but they all seem obvious and also during your turn you have 2 choices. Play strikes to kill something or play recruit points to buy a card. I won't get into room scanning here for length purposes, but paying to flip a card is pretty much all it is.

- Player elimination. I have seen a person die on the second round and had to sit out the rest of the game. There is no reason that boardgames today use this tired old mechanism. Nothing kills the enjoyment of a game more than this mechanism.

- The traitor rules seem tacked on at the last minute as if the developer wanted a traitor mechanism because "traitor games are hot right now".

- The whole game's ruleset just seems half finished and too open ended for no real reason. It's like they tried to cram everything into the game and thereby took away any semblance of elegance, personality or uniqueness.


I could go on about how the movies all feel the same. How every game is just flipping cards and playing strikes until you flip the objective card. How quickly the game grows stale. How little strategy is involved, how badly it scales, how face huggers and chest bursters could have been so much better but I want to keep this somewhat short. Anyway, this is a terrible game and shouldn't be in the top 50 thematic games let alone the top ten. The good news is I can quickly see this game taking a big fall over the next few years.

4/10

RATING: 9.5
Rating after 10 games, averaging about 60 minutes per game.

Will undoubtedly be the best DBG of 2014.

Game mat comes with the game; finally someone who understands the advantage of a mat over a board!

The first scenario was the most difficult for us, and our sweet spot was to add 1 Drone card per player +1.

A great enhancement on the Legendary system!!  Mechanically flawless, scales well, enjoyable, and brimming with theme.

The "coordination" mechanic adds to the Coop nature of the game.  You are picking up cards which will assist your teammates, and playing one on their turn is necessary more often than not.

The added need to scan for enemies really adds to this game, and plays well with the theme.  Once in the Combat Zone, you get attacked by each enemy present.  Nice!

Giving the "3" strength Sergeants "Coordinate" and a Character Class is brilliant!  Even low cost cards give you pause for consideration, depending on how you want to structure your deck.

Wounds do not clutter your deck, they accumulate besides your character until you are eliminated.  Player elimination is mitigated by the Alien player additional rule, which essentially ensures the game will end much quicker, so you can start a new one.  ;)

Although a 10 strength Alien is frightening, the worst enemy is the darn Facehugger!! "Ok, before scanning, be sure to keep at least 3 attack points in case you reveal a Facehugger !!!"


Only negative thing I can find... The name on each card indicating which deck they belong to is way too small... for me anyways.

At least one person I know picked up a copy with 50 duplicate cards...  A slight assembly error, which the publisher immediately recognized and advised would be sending the missing cards (within the next 3 weeks).

Looking forward to trying this with the traitor rules!! The added angst must be exhilarating!

[b]After 6 plays:[/b]  I want to give this an 8 in the worst way—and I often come by here to do just that—but something's holding me back.

I don't know if it's the player elimination—not something I normally have a problem with, as usually when people start dying the rest of the living aren't far behind, but sometimes one person will kick out early and for whatever reason the game will suddenly let up and enter a weird glide phase where things actually turn around, leaving the dead player with little to do other than dealing cards and sliding them around on the playmat forlornly.*

Or maybe it's that fragile variability where the card draws from the myriad decks conspire to make the game stutter between laughably easy and impossibly hard, with little rhyme or reason between either state.

It feels like it [i]wants[/i] to be a story game, but all the moving parts detract from that—and it's too swingy to function as a strategy game, stranding it in an ultimately unsatisfying limbo between the two.  It does neither well enough to really shine.

Also, the card art is hideously inconsistent, scribbling all over the map from cool/evocative to WTF/amateurish.

[size=7]*I suppose the "Player Aliens" advanced rule would solve this for those who die by chestburster, effectively accelerating the end, but what about the poor sap who died by other means?  And yeah, it's easy enough to houserule it so everyone who dies plays an alien, but that just feels like piling on... but maybe that's the whole point, right?  The only problem is that I'm violently allergic to houserules.[/size]

This deck-builder works well at every player count we've tried, although like many others, it's a bit easier with fewer.

Alien feels properly tense, Aliens feels like you're mowing down walking nightmares (or at least trying to), and... yeah, all of the films provide a fun experience.

The roles, the requirement to scan zones for enemies, the Chestburster (plus Alien role!), and many more elements. Oh, the Hidden Agendas!

If you like strong deck-builders with a entertaining narrative, this one is fantastic.

Pretty fun so far.  Played 2 players movie 1, 2 & 3.  Played game 1 with 5 and 3 as well.  Icons are a bit small and the card sorting on unboxing was painful but game is good so far.  Not too long, objectives are great, tense and fun.  Picked this up because we enjoyed Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle.  It has a darker theme, but the game is more balanced and tense.  The objectives make for lots of surprises and fun.  Important to note, the game is much harder with more players and the expansion has a table that explains to put more drones into the objectives decks with more players.

RATING: 7
I love the Alien movies, but I held out on this one because I really didn't like Marvel Legendary. However, when I found out about how this game integrates the progression of eggs to facehuggers to chestbursters, I knew I had to try it. And I'm so glad I did. It's great working together to battle the aliens, and having your own hand of cards and special ability means it's a bit more difficult for the "alpha player" to take over everything. The face-down enemy cards, creeping ever closer, create tension, and you never really know what's around the corner...just like the movies. Really enjoy this one. The problem is that the only scenario in the game that I really enjoy is the first movie, so rating gets bumped down because of that.

As the first Legendary Encounters spinoff from Marvel Legendary, I was hooked the first time I played.  As much as I like the Marvel game, I definitely prefer the Encounters system.

Still one of the most thematic deck-builders I've ever played. Alien Encounters was one the first games I bought coming into this hobby, so it has a soft-spot for me, but regardless it is an amazing game. I've introduced this to 4 different game groups and they all have loved it. Played all sets of players (2-5) and it works very well, even with the difficulty spike past 3+ players.

Pro: 
*Fun.

Cons:
*Too much luck: some games are a cake walk, while others are impossible. 
*Worst card stock for a game with lots of shuffling I've ever played with. One of my two "Somebody help!" cards from the strike deck was torn at the bottom right between what looks like small depressions made by metal clamps - I emailed UD, who made me jump thru some hoops but then mailed me a replacement.
*Poor graphic design with tiny sorting text, way too busy backgrounds, and very different cartoon styles (compare the 2 "thing with the knife" drawings). 
*No card inventory in the rule book, which must make the initial sorting without the inventory available here on BGG even more of a pain.
*Insufficient rule descriptions requiring an FAQ that's longer than the rule book.

Minor nitpicks:
*The theme doesn't work when playing with only the 1st or 3rd movies' cards because there aren't soldiers or multiple aliens in them.
*I'd've preferred photos from the movies instead of cartoon art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Like the original Legendary it is a pain to set up and put away. The way the bad things work has changed to introduce a Strike deck as well as the concept of hit points. Which allows player elimination. The ability to give some cards to other players in their turn and to heal other players makes the game more cooperative. The scheme and master mind have been replaced by scenarios and objectives. The way the bad cards come out face down and are only revealed as they leave the first 5 spaces and move into the combat area gives a feeling of the Alien movies. 

In terms of production values the cards looks too similar to each other and the text seems even smaller than the original game. It still doesn't have named dividers. It has a rubber play mat which is good.

Awesome game, I prefer the game itself to Marvel Legendary. That being said, I prefer the theme of Marvel to Alien. Highly thematic. Expansions will certainly help increase the replayability, which for now isn't comparable to Marvel. Be aware that the game is hard when you play custom scenarios mixing with superheroes.

RATING: 2.5
My first couple games were great, but in general the game seems to be incredibly uneven. Too many games wind up with the mid-game and on being completely stressless. Yet you still have to keep playing through because you can't finish until you complete the objective in the last deck, which may not be possible until you've drawn the very last card of the alien deck. So you just spin your wheels. The worst bit is that, if you're unlucky, a facehugger at the wrong time can simply kill somebody. Usually avoidable, but when it happens it feels cheap. And when you're playing 2-player, it basically just ends the game in an anti-climactic loss, because even if you could win by playing through, it's incredibly tedious for the surviving player and boring for the deceased player to do so.

I loved this at the beginning, but now it's on the trade pile. Super disappointing, because I was so pumped when I ordered it. Game's rating dropped from an 8 after 2 players to a 4 after about 5 or 6. Boo.

RATING: 8
Definitely a different and possibly better game than Marvel Legendary, especially if you are into the theme. Plays more easily with more players with the coordinate mechanism and I like it that there is not really a semi-cooperative mechanism from the get-go until you introduce the alien player variant.

Had to let it go though because there was a bit too much book-keeping to maintain for my liking, and the graphics may be too gory for my wife

I've played through the 1st movie (Alien) encounter solo and lost at the VERY end. I can't wait to try with others, and try the other movies!

Now played through the second movie, which went a lot smoother than the first. I love some of the cards in the Aliens movie, especially introducing the "Vigilant" mechanic. Ended up winning, and pretty handily at that. The best part was I played solo (2 handed) while watching the Aliens movie. The game synced up surprisingly well! The Aliens "cut power" as soon as I scanned that "They Cut the Power" card up. One of my better gaming experiences.

After two solo plays, i don't understand the love for this game yet(?) The deckbuilding options are limited. The wound (strike) cards are wildly variable (0-5 damage) to the point where an event that gives a player 2 strike cards can kill them immediately. 

I like the theme and the cards in the Hive deck are interesting as aposed to it just being a procession of monsters like in other games, it's just a shame that this is based on the legendary deckbuilding style.

I'm not a fan of the player elimination (which can occur on a player's second turn). While it serves as a motivating threat and fits the theme well, 30+ minutes removed from the game is obnoxious.

Some bits of the Legendary system irk me as well. It's a little too simple for me, and the limitations on card availability and deck-pruning are frustrating. For folks who are familiar with deck-building games, be warned that the only way you can weed-out cards is through card effects - no trashing as an action! Drawing an entire hand of starter cards during the endgame is super lame, I must admit.

Adherence to theme, on the other hand, is excellent. Face-down threats progress every turn as you urgently strengthen your deck. Most matches felt hopeless, but the few narrow victories were worth the struggle.

My first play, it was going badly for us. Then I became an alien and things were going badly for everyone else. So why wouldn't you just play to become the aliens? I didn't get it from the guy who was teaching, but I've since learned that each game is for points and you play multiple games to determine a winner. Nobody gets points if the aliens win. So this unpleasant experience I had is something I have to repeat over and over again if I want to get a meaningful result. I mean, yeah, next time I probably won't become an alien, and maybe I'll even get something resembling a good result. But that's an awful long way to go for a game that hasn't provided any joy yet.

Excellent addition to the Legendary series. It does a great job of modifying the game so it isn't a cookie-cutter copy of Legendary, but it still feels like Legendary. After trying out the Alien player (upon death) optional rule, I really didn't like it. It doesn't scale well and the Alien player really doesn't have much to think about on their turn. I haven't had a chance to try the agendas yet unfortunately.

600 cards jumbled together randomly was a real pain in the ass to sort, especially since I didn't initially spot how to do it since the writing is so tiny!

It's really a pain in the ass to play LEGENDARY solo but this game lends itself to it with the adventures set per the movies.

After Thunderstone:Advance, I was not all that impressed with deck-building games, but when I heard that Alien Deck-builder was going to come out, I had to check it out.

Absolutely fantastic first play-through! This is the Alien movie game in a box. The theme is just so rich in this game. I needed this! What I was looking for so dearly in Thunderstone:Advance is present in Encounters! This game restored my hopes for deck building games again.

The art...theme...I just cannot find a bad thing to say about this game other than set-up and breakdown time. All though it can be mitigated by well-organizing, but still I find it a bit chore to do. However, it is ok for me :)

Another winning game from Upper Deck.

Aliens are great to fight. 

Grab an Avatar and four characters and reenact one of the four Alien movies. Or mix and match. Great game. Not a push over at all. ALL games are tough. 

What a great concept. Looking forward to other games in the Legendary line.

First impression: My favorite of the Legendary system. I love the way this invokes its theme through scanning the cards and cooperating with your fellow players. I really dislike the player elimination, but I also really like the Facehugger/Chestburster mechanism. Bit of a conundrum there. If you dislike the random market, though, that is still present, and still feels very limited.

Wow, this game turned out to be even better than I expected. I've never played the Marvel Legendary game, but the theme alone hit the sweet spot for me. Beautiful comic style artwork. It's easy to pick up, a bitch to beat. Nice playmat included. My one complaint is that the card quality isn't great, but then there are 600 of them, so it's understandable that to keep costs down they went with a lesser card stock. I'm already seeing some wear, but I can't even conceive of sleeving this monster. 
A must buy for Aliens, Lengendary, and deckbuilding fans.

I had never played any of the Legendary game system before this. The box comes with card configurations to support playing versions around each of the first 4 alien films. After that, you can mix and match characters and objectives from the four movies to experience many alternate reality Alien films. Players are working together to defeat the Alien deck, which is comprised of three mini decks stacked on each other for objectives 1-3. The requirements for each objective is contained within its mini deck and be a simple as turning over a couple of cards to defeating incredibly difficult aliens in very specific circumstances that you usually need other cards to achieve. The alien deck is revealed slowly with face-down cards traveling through "The Complex" until reaching a combat zone where aliens can attack the players. As such, players are trying to reveal and take cards out of play while in The Complex before they have the ability to attack.

On a player's turn, she can fight any face-up aliens, scan The Complex in order to reveal the cards there or purchase a more powerful crew member to add to their decks. Players begin with very basic fight and purchase cards and need to improve pretty quick. Because many objectives are dependent on drawing certain cards, you have to be prepared to last through a spell of not getting the cards that will help you. A unique aspect to this game (and I assume all Legendary titles) is the "coordinate" ability. Cards with coordinate allow you to give their ability to another player while you draw another card. I have not seen another game with this ability and it really contributes well to the co-op intention of the designers. Because cards are drawn in a certain order, you are certainly at the mercy of the shuffle to a significant extent. If that doesn't bother you, then you'll find a good, tense, thematic game where seriously f'd up crap awaits with every flip of the card...

Awful build quality, card stock, organisation, and card filing "solution" offered. Really pitiful presentation for what will hopefully be a great game but I don't know yet as I have to spend another $40 on sleeves before I can play it.

12/04/15 - First game, won against first movie, so I suspect I am doing something wrong.

25/04/15 - Second game, died halfway through first objective of first mission. I suspect I am doing something right.

26/04/15 - Third game, got to the third objective of the first mission, so doing a bit better.

Jan-16 - Did the full stretch of four scenarios solo two-fisted. Great game, but doesn't have enough variety in the box to hang on to and play again.

This is largely the same game as Legendary, which in my opinion is very disappointing. Legendary is an okay game with some almost clever ideas so I was really hoping this iteration would step it up a notch or two. 

However, there are some positive changes. The game can now be played full co-op which is a definite improvement. Hopefully the game is more difficult. They have introduced some mechanics to help one another which should help the co-op feel come through. They also have a much smoother difficulty knob in the Drone cards so making the game harder should be easy.

It's also worth noting that given the similarity to Legendary they did an admirable job implementing the theme.

A cooperative deckbuilder where the theme dominates and gameplay takes a backseat. The first scenario didn't even remotely pose a challenge. It tells a nice story but overstays its welcome. For a thematic deckbuilder, Thunderstone offers more game while Ascension does the gameplay quicker and more to the point. I'm not Legendary's target group though, YMMV if your focus is on themes and you're more into cooperation.

Really enjoy this but does not scale well. If playing by the original rules a 5 player game is pretty much a guaranteed loss. Use the variants that come with the game, namely take one or two turns before the Aliens enter the complex. It does a good job of capturing moments from the movies but for the real "Aliens" experience nothing tops Leading Edge's Aliens boardgame.

Played a single 4-player game, and did the first movie scenario. I didn't like the deck building. Never felt like I even really got a chance to deck build. I felt trapped by my starting hand, as there no was no way to really cull it down. I never felt like I ramped up as the game went by. I never felt like I had any interesting choices.

I'll give it another shot as a 2-player game.

Setup takes too long for me to even have interest in it for a 1 player game.

The strong theme is both its merit and detriment for me. I really like how the four movie scenarios capture their respective themes. I think the game does a tremendous job here. But the idea of mixing characters from the various movies is abhorrent to me. In that regard the original Legendary offers more variability for me. I have much less problems mixing up the Marvel characters. But that's personal preference only. The stronger emphasis on cooperation is certainly an advantage of Legendary Encounters over the original.

The best Alien themed game so far. The hidden agenda and alien player decks spice up the game if needed and add tons of replayability to an already versatile game.

I was little disappointed by ability to manipulate deck (or more specifically it is lack). Also although games were interesting it seemed to always follow same route. Buy few sergeants to share funds and then start to buy more expensive cards. Although it was usually most beneficial to buy just few of them, so they could be quickly circulated.

I probably most liked movie 3 and 4. I was somehow disappointed by movie 2. 

Although option is there, I am not interested in mixing objectives and decks from various movies. 

We have also tried Alien player once and it seemed too unbalanced in his favour. It was interesting, but not much fun.

Overall I pretty enjoyed my few games, however I am not interested to play again. Mainly due to not interesting deckbuilding mechanic and inability to manipulate deck (I love Star Realms, which gives much more freedom). I have played all scenarios and repeated playing is not so much interesting due to lack of surprises.

Wow!  This game is a blast!  I adore the Alien movies (especially the first two), so this definitely grabbed my interest.  I do like deck building and co-op as mechanisms, so I did my research and scooped this one up without playing it first.  I made a good move.  Such a fun game!  It is dripping with theme.  You will feel the dread as you draw strikes or move new aliens down the complex to meet you in the combat zone.  It also can be played solo, which is a nice plus.  I understand that common opinion is that this is superior to the Marvel game, but I haven't tried that yet.  I don't really have interest in the Marvel theme, so this game was meant for me.  Do be warned that sorting the (600) cards the first time will take some time and there are sometimes missing cards.  I was missing one card and had to get UpperDeck to send it to me.  The individual card checklist found here on BGG is a necessity.  If you can get past those hurdles, the game is fantastic!  Best deck-builder that I have played.

Revendu.
Au premier contact, le jeu impressionne par la règle du Chestburster: Si vous récupérez un Facehugger, si il n'a pas était éliminé avant la fin de votre prochain tour vous devez piocher une carte chestburster et la mettre dans votre défausse. Arrivé à la fin de votre pioche, vous mélangez votre défausse qui redevient votre pioche. Si vous piochez le chestburster... GameOver!
Il est donc facile d'imaginer à quelle point cette règle créée une importante tension dans la partie dès qu'elle se déclenche. Malheureusement cette règle implique aussi que, si vous disposer de trop de cartes vous permettant de bannir des cartes de votre jeu (carte de la main de départ par exemple),  le chestburster sera trop facilement éliminé est ne sera donc plus un élément de tension. Du coup il est très compliqué de gérer la taille de sa pioche, ce qui engendre des moments ou on se refuse à acheter de nouvelles cartes  par ce que notre jeu est déjà bien assez épais  et que toutes vos bonnes cartes sont fonduent au milieu de la main de base et de quelques autres cartes de transition dont on aimerait bien se délester... Cette fausse bonne idée engendre aussi du coup une difficulté assez brutal du jeu. Difficulté qui s'amplifiera si vous mourrez et que vous prenez le deck Alien pour pourrir votre/vos ex partenaire(s).

Malgrés quelques bonnes idées le jeu rebute par le manque de maitrise de son deck et sa difficulté.

À jouer avec la bande son des films bien entendu.

RATING: 6.5
A personal favorite theme with some good story telling ability with a good amount of suspense; true to the nature of the movie. Outside of this however I feel the game falls a little flat. I feel characters are obviously pigeonholed to build a certain type of deck so there is a sense of false choice there. Unfortunately I feel this game also falls victim to the fact that the best/most efficient actions are very obvious. This leads to an overall feeling that you're essentially flipping over a bunch of cards, playing the most obvious best card/combo and hope you don't come up empty when a tough encounter appears. That's not to say there is no choice at all but I feel the fate of the shuffle weighs very heavy in this game. Fun to play out a scenario in a high suspense story telling manner but I wouldn't mistake this for a strategy/tactical game with hard decisions.

RATING: 9
Played about 10 solo games and a single 2 player game (with hidden agenda and alien player rules). Playing through all the movie scenarios first.

So far, this has been an excellent game. Really captures the mood of the movies. I don't normally enjoy solo games but this has kept my attention for a few days now. I think it will be a lot of fun when the game group meets. Sometimes the sequence of card flips and events really gives on the feel of being 'in the story', which is a pretty cool accomplishment for a card game.

Hard to say for sure, but the Alien (film 1) scenario seems really challenging to beat (that's good...took about 6 plays to win). Aliens (2) seems a bit too easy (played twice, won twice). Aliens3 was pretty easy the first and only time I played. Have not finished an Alien Resurrection based game yet.

If the game gets too easy with multi-players with the coordinate ability, it's easy enough to tweak the game according to the rule suggestions or even using the spare blank cards (i.e. as Barracks filler that takes up space in the HQ for a turn (or more)).

Giving it only a 9 because I've only played less than a week and the box didn't come filled with money or chocolate.

RATING: 7
Has a much stronger thematic feel than Marvel Legendary at the expense of having less scenarios. However, like Marvel Legendary has a bunch of effects that are pretty luck based (e.g. the effects that make you lose a random 1+ cost in your hand). In addition while there doesseem to be less really swingy luck based cards as Marvel Legendary (Feast, Loki's Father of Lies card, etc.) I really dislike the lack of ability to mill cards in the game.

The stronger thematic feel comes from 1: the mastermind not just sitting there the whole game for the most part not doing anything 2. each hero having a slightly different starting deck 3. scenarios that change more as the game is played (3 objectives per scenario with the events/hazards changing depending on which objective you're on) 4. monsters attacking you when they "escape". This is contrary to Marvel Legendary, where depending on the scheme there is often a significant population of villains that has no penalty when escaping. The "Coordinate" key word also makes the game more of a co-op instead of half multiplayer solitaire. Unfortunately this comes at the price of only have 4 scenarios in the game (albeit with several modules you can add on e.g. traitors). If I owned this game it would be fun creating my own scenarios but alas, the luck swings I mentioned in the previous paragraph makes this game not good enough to buy for me.

I don't understand why everyone thinks this game is so hard, unless you're playing with the traitor. Yes I was playing it as 2 players which meant my deck was a lot less diluted, yes I have a lot of deck building experience, and yes we technically probably should have lost because we accidentally scanned a room with a hazard before killing an alien, but we really didn't utilize the -2 health things in the second wave of the second scenario well, and we played it out, and if we had resolved things in the opposite order would have won with things quite under control. We also had 3 hive cards played to start with and used only 2-1-0 instead of 2-2-2 of the weak aliens.

An exvcellent experience game. Not sure how replayable it will be for me once I have completed the films, but I have played Alien and Aliens and they seriously felt like I was living through the films. The theme fits the system so well, if you are a fan of the films then you must check out this game.

A deck builder where you are trying to fight aliens from the Alien movie.  It is highly thematic where you can get infected and turn into an alien.  Game play is hard but winnable after a couple of tries.  There are several scenarios.

Some of the art was a little gruesome.  Not very kid friendly for younger kids.  Also the card backs were all the same making it very difficult to sort the cards at first.  But overall a solid game.  If you sleeve the game the setup complaints go away.

I think this is the only game in my collection that makes me visibly nervous while playing. The tension builds slowly as you accomplish objectives and watch the alien enemies grow in strength and tenacity. Win or lose, I'm always ready to give it another try. If this game only included one movie scenario it would still be awesome, but to have all four movies depicted on the cards makes it a tremendous value. Deck building with a purpose... SURVIVAL! Love this game and highly recommend it to everyone.

Very much enjoy playing this solo (Using 2 avatars).  Simple to learn, hard to win, tells a good story. Very thematic, art is excellent, you can see the movies playing out before you. 

I quite enjoy both this and Predator from the same publisher. Great art, great feeling of the movies when you play. Helps to be a fan of the subject matter of course. My comments are for having only played solo, but I do love it so.

Stop your grinning and drop your linen its a co-op deck building game based on the 4 aliens movies. play each movie and build your deck to complete each film. Mechanics fit each film fantastically and thematically.
If you like marvel legendary and your a fan of the aliens film this is a must. plenty of hudson quotes flying around. The more players the harder this is though - 5 seemed way too hard.each film comes with a set of barracks cards / deck and it would have been nice to have had a choice of decks to put in but that's only a small gripe.

Great fusion of mechanics and theme.  It feels like you are playing the movies, including the same level of suspense and intensity.  This has lots of life in it, as you can replay each scenario without knowing the flow or outcome.  The mixing of objectives/location adds a lot of possibilities.  Semi-compatible with other Legendary titles, but it can be done with online research and some creativity.  Solo play is challenging and enjoyable.  Difficulty can be increased or decreased.  Plus you can add a traitor element.  Lots of variety in the base game, perhaps more than Legendary Marvel.  It has the same limitations as Legendary Marvel: set-up/teardown takes a few minutes, 3-player game is the sweet spot, & rules can be a bit daunting to new players.  Overall, if you like deck-builders and love the Alien franchise, you will love this game.

I loved the Alien and Aliens movies. This game captures what makes those movies special and makes for a very fun co-op. It uses card art from the graphic novels, and I'm ok with that. There's a fair amount of replayability since you can recreate any of the five movies, or do a mash up and throw everything together. 

I highly dislike the "traitor" mechanism, which kicks in when a human player dies and becomes an alien player. My one experience with it was horrible. I don't know what the designers were thinking regarding play balance when they came up with it.

Marvel Legendary was a complete dud for me for several reasons, but mainly due to it being too easy and I wasn't a fan of the semi-coop nature of the game.  

Legendary Encounters surpasses it in many ways.  It is more difficult, but you can also adjust the difficulty by changing how many drones you add to the hive deck.  It's a pure coop and adds in Coordinate cards to help your teammates.  There is added tension since you need to scan locations to see what kind of aliens will pop out at you, but you're using up your attack power to do it.  You have to balance when to attack and when to scan more locations.  There are objectives to work towards - such as trapping a particular alien in a specific location to defeat them or setting up sentry guns.  

Maybe my rating will drop with more plays (currently at 10+), but it is a highly addictive game for me right now.

An excellent game that replicates the heart pounding tension of the Alien franchise very well.  To me, it also has a bit of a legacy game aspect since certain cards that come up may have certain permanent affects for the rest of the game and there's definitely a campaign feel to the game with the different objective, but without any replayability concerns. Speaking of replayability, no concerns here.  You can mix and match objectives, locations, and character decks across the 4 movies completely, plus there are advanced rules with hidden agendas and players who can actually become the alien!  If you are a fan of the Alien franchise or co-op games in general, this is a must-own.

Best solo game ever played!!!!!

1st mission, solo two players. Fun, although was easier than expected. Maybe next time will be more difficult. 
Ok, now I´ve played with fewer drone cards (1 deck 2, 2 deck 3) and the Aliens destroyed me.

2 Mission, I lost two times before I could win, way more challenging trhan mission 1...HOWEVER, I played with less drone cards (1 in deck 2 and 2 in deck 3). I´ll try this combination with mission 1.

3rd Mission, is the one I enjoyed the less so far

UNlike the movies I think Mission 4, is the best in the game. however, is too easy for 2 players solitaire

Thematically wonderful, mechanically it's deeply flawed.

It's more than just the multiple random elements potentially magnifying each other (for the players or against), but also things like the Alien players removing cards from players hands - effectively removing their ability to actually play the game or offer any counter play.

The first game we played, we should not have won, we were deep in the hole, and got a string of luck that enabled the win.

The second game we played, the trader outed immediately, nabbed a face hugger (via luck), and because an Alien before anything could be done by another player.  They then proceeded to get a second player infected, again without counter play ability.  In short order the two were aliens, and got a third infected.  All the while removing cards from the remaining players hands - resulting in the Aliens having all the actions/turns and the humans having none.  It was runaway with no counterplay - which is what you get when the players removing or destroy cards from player hands rather than inserting cards or manipulating the environment (poor design).  

Absolute shame, the theme is wonderful.

My favorite deckbuild, which I play solo and also with friends. Can be played as coop, hidden enemy or open enemy, with application of few house rules, even as competitive game. Wonderfully themed, catching the spirit of Alien movies, it is also very tense game and one of those, when I really even feel fear during game-play. Trust me, there is nothing worse, then have chestbuster card in your deck and waiting when it will show up.

[b]2016-01-09 8[/b] After 3x2p Plays:
Super thematic deck-building game that gives a much better co-op feel than its Marvel counterpart. The game is sufficiently difficult and the coordinate cards really bring the players together for most effective play. The one downside for us personally is the random draw of injury cards. In 2p game, if one unlucky player keeps drawing high injury card, they can be dead within a couple turns and it is not as fun for the surviving player to play on their own. This disadvantage will be balanced out at higher player count.

Theme and game play are mostly very well done.  The biggest problem with this game, any why I didn't rank it higher, is it's not balanced well.  The more players you add the more difficult you make it on yourself due to everyone have much weaker decks from taking less turns while you advance in difficulty just as quickly as you would with two players.

Mi primer deckbuilding game y que manera de comenzar en estos juegos!!
Espectacular, tremendamente temático e inmersivo, fácil de aprender y lleno de tensión... Como fan de las películas de Alien, capta perfectamente su esencia, se palpa el agobio de descubrir lo que esconde una carta y de verte sobrepasado por los aliens. El juego es asequible en solitario y  la dificultad va en aumento según se añadan jugadores. 
Un punto muy positivo es que se puede regular esta dificultad (se puede hacer mas fácil...y mas difícil!). En resumen, a día de hoy mi mejor adquisición del 2015.

Checking my card list to see if anything is missing and hope to try a solo game soon to learn the mechanics.

Seemed easy but then the wheels fell off and I got smashed.  Took longer than expected but maybe just learning creakiness.

Update, 8/15:  yep, had a great solo game and it went pretty quickly.  Also played five players and really enjoyed it, with a playtime close to 75 minutes.  Have yet to come close in the first scenario!

6/16:  now seven plays of the first scenario without a win.  Came so very close last night, down to the last three cards but drew a blank for battle cards, and two wounds did me in.  Very enjoyable game, solo or with others.  Plays pretty quickly and setup not too bad, but the box way too big.

9/25: Finally won the first scenario  on my ninth try!  Managed it with the scout character: I like this one.

7/17/17: Defeated the third scenario first try, handily, with the priest.  Will try this one on hard mode next time!  Game played very fast: I can crank out a game in under an hour now.

9/28/17:  Played the third again, twice, going one and one.  I should try hard version next time!  Playing with no extracards in the deck, as the expansion suggests, but has it made it too easy?

I haven't felt this wrapped up in a co-op game since the first time I played [gameid=823]. This was the highlight of BGG.CON 2014 for me. The thematic quality is top-notch. 

It takes the Legendary system, makes it completely cooperative and then adds a new keyword [b]Coordinate[/b] to help include all players each turn.

Especially cool is that players can become Aliens (then using a second deck) or traitors. The game can be quite difficult at times. Unlike [gameid=129437] you can't just fight Villains (Hive here) when they pop out. They rooms they're in first need to be Scanned (using Attack power). So the Aliens begin adding up quite quickly. In fact I would say they're probably impossible without the new Coordinate mechanism. 

Only issue with this game so far is the player elimination. In a multi-player game it's possible for someone to get knocked out fairly early. Here Wounds take away your hit points... if they're not healed, and some cannot be, you die.

One of the most mechanically thematic games I have ever played; the Hive deck just feels so much like the films. Lots of replayability included in the box to boot. I love this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent step forward in the legendary system but its difficulty and player elimination has it take two steps back. Plenty of replayability as there are multiple episodes and modes you can play. I especially like how the line up is face down and you have to pay to flip cards. This mechanic is just as heart pounding as the movies since you never know where a face-hugger is. Face-huggers are the best and worst part of this game as they provide the horror and thriller aspect to the game but they also provide immediate player elimination. The game is excellent and the cards and art are among the best around. And Thank you, thank you for finally going with a play mat.

RATING: 9
In the very first game I played, I had 3 eggs pop up at the same time, then an event came up and I had 3 facehuggers in front of me. We managed to kill 2, but the third did its job. Next reshuffle I was drawing cards one by one holding my breath. Turns out, I drew 3 full hands without drawing the chestburster! That gave me an out, as there were 4 cards in my deck, one of them the burster. And me and my brother both had a card that can kill the top card of a players deck. So 50-50 chance to get that burster before it gets me! 

Alas, it was at the very bottom of those 4 cards, and it did get me. Me being the medic, made sure that a huge explosion later and some very nasty strike cards killed my brother soon after, just as the perfect organism popped up in the complex. Gah! 

10/10, would get pregnant again.

A deck building game I actually like. The theme comes through, especially if you play the movie scenarios. Thankfully it's not semi co-op like its predecessor, Marvel, since that never worked for me. I look forward to using the hidden agendas and alien player decks.

Theme is the only reason to play this co-op over other similar co-ops. It shares general mechanisms with f.ex. LotR:LCG. I'd rather play that.

RATING: 7.5
Very preliminary rating, but so far so good here. I held off getting it for a long time but there's definitely enough differences between this and Marvel Legendary to make owning both worth it. Scanning before interacting adds some tension and I love the more constructed nature of the scenarios. That being said, even as an Alien fan I'm not sure I like the game better than Marvel, which seems to put me in the minority. Still very enjoyable.

RATING: 8.5
Creates tremendous tension and you can't help but make quote after quote with this one during play. Love how it takes the elements of each film, but doesn't tie you rigidly to them.
3rd September 2015: Up from an 8 to 8.5. I was concerned that repeated plays would lessen the fun as the scenarios are tied to the films (unless you mix the decks), but each feels very different and has given many different play experiences whilst almost always remaining tense and tight to the bitter end.

RATING: 9
The good - Great game, great mechanics. The artwork is almost perfect with the only proviso being it is in comic book form. What would have made it absolutely 100% perfect? Resurrecting Giger from the grave and having him do the cards. Either that or a more black and white Sin City approach. The cards fit in the box, even sleeved. Thankfully no vacuum molded divider that breaks in a week and wont fit the cards if sleeved. Game mat is great and fits in the box. 

The bad - All of this is real nitpicking. The decks come shrink wrapped in about ten packs and none of them are collated. This means initial sleeving and set up literally goes on for hours. I timed myself and it took over four hours to separate, sleeve and collate all the cards into their appropriate decks. The worst is the fact that the graphic design is horrendous (graphic design is different from artwork). For example - Event and Hazard cards go with specific decks. How do you know which deck? Get out a microscope and look for the teeny tiny type at the bottom of the card which indicates the deck it goes with. I was half way through setup before I saw this on the Event cards so make sure you take a good look for the tiny type at the bottom. The only other thing I would change is the card backs. Graphic design that was a little more Alien oriented would have been really nice here. It is totally weird to me that with all the time spent on great artwork for the mat and the cards it seems like the card backs were an afterthought. This could be solved through using sleeves with a cool back but it really seems anyone looking at the game with cards on the mat should have spoken up and said "you know, super hero blue with that logo really doesn't fit with all this other great stuff" 

Great game, my complaints really are just nitpicking, I would highly recommend getting this one.

Estoy super enganchado después de probarlo, de hecho lo he puesto en la primera posición de mi ránking....Juego que te sumerge totalmente en el ambiente de la pelicula y que tiene una rejugabilidad bestial ademas de escalar la dificultad. Juego cooperativo en el que se puede jugar con una versión de traidor oculto y con reglas avanzadas si te mata un chestbuster te vuelves alien...ESPECTACULAR

Since I don't enjoy deck building games in general, it should be a high praise that I even own this game.  Even with all of the dividers, set up takes a bit long.  This is really a game best for two to three people to get the best from the card combinations.  Solo this game is alright, but you should play two hands for the coop cards.  I prefer playing the Firefly LE for the extra ship elements and episode versus movie chapters.  Its artwork is lacking though and best as a 2P.  The Big Trouble In Little China LE is better for multiple players or first timers, because it is simple and the combo cards aren't necessarily needed to win.  I think the story elements from each franchise play a big role in enjoying the game, so I'd go with whichever is your fave.

A deck builder based in the Alien movie-verse.  Using the basic formula implemented in Legendary: Marvel but with player elimination and a greater co-operative focus with coordinate cards that players use to help each other.
There is an optional traitor mechanic as well, but I haven't used this and the game is tough enough anyway!
All in all a very enjoyable encounter but I still prefer the Marvel games :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Legendary: Alien covers all 4 Alien movies and somehow manages to convey both the theme and feel of each of those movies individually which I think is an amazing feat in itself, let alone from a card game!

It is very easy to understand and play, and because its totally coop has quite a light and breezy feel to it despite the depressive tone of the Alien movies.

There's so many things I like about how the game works and its so damn clever I honestly can't level much criticism against it!

One major point is that the number of players taking part drastically adjusts the difficulty level- 4 players makes the game so much harder then with 3 players you wouldn't believe the difference.

I heard there's also a Predator version coming soon. If its anything like this it will be worth having a go at.

Terrific variety in the objectives. Different enough to separate itself from Marvel Legendary. Artwork is terrific and theme is strong. The one big issue is that it might be TOO difficult.

Worst out-of-the-box game I've ever seen.  All of the cards are just randomly thrown in there!  Took me and a friend over an hour to get the cards sorted out.  After that, however, the game is fun and difficult.

Recommend playing the score to the Alien movies on Pandora (or whatever) to give atmosphere.

RATING: 7
Interesting deck builder that doesn't really feel like a deck builder. Feels a bit like Thunderstone meets Arkham Horror. Excellent production values (nice artwork, grip mat, card quality) make for a good theme and narrative. However, i never felt like my deck quite got the opportunity to get materially stronger as the game progressed. The lack of cards that help thin my deck was the main detractor here, and so it barely felt like most deck builders that I've played. I do need to give it another try and see if I can do better at buidling a stronger deck faster. Also, I'd refuse to play this with more than 4 players - there too much downtime otherwise.

This game is the ultimate board game! So much more difficult that anything Legendary Marvel can throw at you! Even Galactus can't hang with the Aliens game.

This hasn't got the variety of one of my favourite games (Marvel Legendary) but actually has better mechanics. It's hard and tense and even has hidden traitor and one vs all mechanics. I'm not sure how balanced the alien player deck is (we may have misread the rules, but I played only one card per player as playing the whole hand seemed too difficult).

Doesn't hook me in quite as much as I would like - maybe I need to savour it a little more - but still a convincing and enjoyable romp through the Alien tetralogy.

The great play mat almost makes up for the absurdly big and largely empty box.

Wore out the easy solo option early on but really enjoyed playing it whilst watching the movies.  Then went back to it and removed the drones to increase the difficulty and started to like it all over again.  

Multiplayer has been hit and miss with player elimination being an old school sort of situation - maybe I'm bitter because I usually get eliminated first!  That said it's still a fun game and the IP is ace.

As you'd expect, Upper Deck did a great job of capturing the feel of an Aliens film.  A little different than Legendary Marvel, you just have a set of goals to accomplish.  Even if you're getting pounded by Aliens, and all your friends are dying left and right, as long as you get those goals accomplished you win.  One of the guys working the tourny book said of 88 games played on Saturday, 10 won.  And the guy I demoed it with said he hadn't had a group win yet.  To win, it seems like you REALLY have to cooperate with each other, and you are always barely surviving- just like an Alien movie!

Ridiculously thematic!  There are so many good aspects to this game.  If you are interested in the Alien universe, like co-ops, or enjoy card games (specifically deck-building ones) this is a game you will not go wrong on buying.

The tension and suspense that is built is surprising; with a modicum of imagination one finds oneself pursued, desperate, and fighting panic.

I held off on getting this one for awhile not trusting the hype but was really glad when I finally did purchase it.  It was the best first game experience I have ever had.

And don't be intimidated by the sorting experience out of the box, 30 minutes of checking out the cards was actually pretty fun!

Board games created to follow the story line of a movie will turn me away most times, but Legendary Encounters gets it right. Following the story line of four Alien movies, you and your friends will attempt to stay alive through at least three stages. Legendary Encounters builds off the Legendary Marvel engine by adding player elimination and adding more to the plots. While I enjoy the plot lay out, I feel it limits the desire to play with a random set. Additionally I am not a fan of the player elimination in Encounters. I might be in the minority but I think Legendary Marvel is a better experience, but both are good games.

I like it quite a bit. The fact that you can play every movie is really cool, and it really does feel like you're helping each other out with some of the cards. I don't think it falls heavily to quarterbacking, at least in the play I had, but it does seem like that could be a potential problem.

[B]TTS Play:[/B] Played the crap out of this one...  Initial movie set up (Alien) played alright.  There was tension, but also some awkward downtime while cycling cards.  May need to skip drones, as the complexity was a bit questionable.  Despite all that, it was enjoyable and definitely worth playing to go through the four movies.  The Aliens movie was somewhat more boring than the original.  Only one alien ever made it to the Strike Zone...   It may be getting a bit repetitive as well.  The trend continues with Alien3.  No real tension or deep decision making.  Plus more obtuse and less active card interactions made it an effort to complete. The difficulty finally ramps - perhaps too much - with the fourth movie - strikes galore without much healing.  The final objective brought a world of hurt and my deck was sorely lacking (need to buy more purchase power during the early game).  The difficulty ramp redeems the game somewhat, but reveals its lack of solo play balance as many of the mechanics require multiple players.  Perhaps play with two hands would be interesting - or a major headache...  Fifth play was very different - totally schooled the alien beeaches.  Main difference: Sergeants - which I had not gained AT ALL the prior four games.  I was able to buy the card Ripley's mother, where I could gain an Alien as an attack card - BRUTAL.  I did get to 10/11 strikes, but was able to heal once...  Enjoyed this one...

I adore the Alien franchise. With that being said it's a great way to play through the movies. I also really enjoy that there could be a traitor. In addition an excellent option is becoming the xenomorph and wipping out the remaining human players. Solo gameplay is possible but if you want to beat the game a few players is a must.

Sometimes incredibly exciting, sometimes totally flat. I had one 5-player session that was tense and tight and ended in a clutch victory, making it one of my favorite gaming session of all time. But the very next 4-player game felt like there was nothing at all we could do, and we just watched as death slowly overcame us. It seems like a masterpiece when all the pieces come together, but the luck factor makes it rather fragile. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
This game shares the mechanisms with other Legendary games and it's partially compatible with them. I have not tried that.

It's a cooperative card game that tries to recreate the 4 Alien movies. We actually played the first Alien movie and it didn't seem anything like it. The second one is more like it, but even if the theme is there, it's not the theme feast some people claim.

The cooperative mechanics feel a bit artificial, but they work very well, mechanics wise.

Players have some roles that create differences and asymmetry between them. It becomes a bit dilluted as the deck grows, but it's ok.

Things I'm not a fan of:
-> Immense setup time (and also to sort out the cards after finishing).
-> Player elimination: can occur quite soon in the game. People will say it's not likely, but it's happened to me more than once.
-> Not a lot of options each turn, you don't have a lot of choices: you cards choose for you.
-> Basically you do the same from the first turn to the last one. You just have more powerful cards and enemies.
-> The deckbuilding aspect is not interesting. Not a lot of diversity, the combos are obvious and they force you to embark on a set path, and no real possibilities to prune your deck. At the end game it becomes huge and the luck of the draw becomes very important.

The thing I like the least is that I got the impression that the adventure was laid up for me to play it, we first have the same level 1 resurce cards and we face the same level 1 enemies, then we continue with the same level 2 resources and enemies, etc. It all seems very artificial to me, it is like a linear role playing adventure. I already played the first adventure and I think that playing it again will be no different. And the game contains too many cards and is way too expensive for such a limited replayability.

The components are not great. The cardstock is average at most, the illustrations/graphic are just OK (they could have been much better considering all the Alien stuff there's already around). The playmat though is excelent!

Pros: plays reasonably quickly, is easy to learn, adjustable difficulty, thematic

Cons: being the Alien player is really boring - I was hoping the Alien role was going to be a lot more exciting; hidden agendas also feel a little weak and this game is probably best as a pure co-op - but I will try a few more times before I abandon them; set-up/clean-up is a bit fiddly; unpacking and organizing the cards was a lot of work

Other: its light (is that good or bad?); it is co-op

I've only managed to play this once and I know there was one rule we got wrong, so this is far from my final verdict ... but man, was I disappointed with this.  From the reviews I've read I was under the impression that the game did a great job of capturing the feel of the Alien movies.  We played the first mission which is based on the first film.  The game essentially seemed to boil down to coping with a conveyor belt of aliens until various objective cards randomly popped out.  Didn't seem much choice involved and there wasn't any captivating story going on.

Enjoyable for what it is, but I find it less 'thematic' (although I don't really like this word, or the word 'theme', since it suggests a sort of superficial version of 'subject matter', which is what I prefer to speak of) than everyone else seems to. Characters from the films appear on the cards, but you don't actually play as those characters. You play as a generic medic, mercenary, or what have you. Also, it's a little odd that your character can usually survive several close combat strikes from the aliens, whereas in the films getting that close was invariably deadly for humans. The net result of all this is what could be called 'thematic dissonance', a feeling that the Alien subject matter has been dealt with in a way that is 'imaginatively confused', for want of a better term.

RATING: 7
Some different monster processing rules, but your turns are much the same experience as the original game. Draw your cards, acquire as many heroes as you can, kill as many monsters as you can. Get powers that feed off each other. It maintains the long setup and long putaway which was a major impediment in the original. It adds a more realistic and relevant (to my generation) theme, which is upside. The monster mechanics are better, and I like how there's increased pressure to kill stuff because random Hit Points are added directly to your hero for each one you don't kill off (rather than adding wounds to your deck). You'd think that not adding wounds to the deck would allow deck management to be easier, but my initial games here never really had enough turns to get my deck tuned enough to get synergies going. And of course getting synergistic turns is where the fun is in deck-builders, so this was a downer compared to the original. If you're keen, choose the one with the more attractive theme to you, otherwise it doesn't add much to the genre.

Best mechanics and theme in a Legendary game. Objectives and difficulty make it feel like you're in the Alien movie of the scenario you're playing.

Very Solid. Cards are balanced well. Difficulty is challenging and highly customizable using official rules.

Great for Solo and Coop. High replayability.

Here's a great review:

Fun. A true co-op deck-builder. Similar mechanisms to Marvel Legendary. Good design. I'm so glad this game got made.

I'm not sure if Legendary Encounters has the replayability that Marvel has, but we'll see with the upcoming expansion(s).

It's odd, in that you don't really take on the role of a particular protagonist.  Traded.

RATING: 8
"Compared to Legendary Marvel, I like that it is pure co-op. But it has player elimination (or betrayal), and isn't as good solo as the Golden solo variant for Marvel. The narrative arc is great, and the theme comes through, but you still feel like a manager more than a single character. Setup is non-trivial, but perhaps not as bad as some say."

What I like:
- Pure co-op (if you ignore the alien players and traitors)
- Very thematic
- Smooth engine similar to Legendary Marvel and Ascension
- Player mat works quite well (although it's a bit too long to fit crosswise on our table)
- Coordinate keyword is excellent

What I don't like:
- [b]Mini-deck identifiers should have been larger!!![/b]
- Box is an awkward size
- The game can feel like a brutal beat-down
- I'm not familiar with the Alien movies, and would prefer a less bloody theme
- Solo play loses the Coordinate keyword, so probably not as good as the Legendary Marvel "Golden" variant

I would put the weight around 2.8, just slightly above BGG voters.

Best themed deck building game I have played/own so far ...

This really has hit the mark for me /us plus the addition of role changing and playing as an alien really makes this game such fun...

I also really love the play  mat ...would take that over a warping board any day ...

My only tiny tiny criticism is I wish the company would not print generic card dividers but ones with card names /subject / card group etc a la resident evil etc ...

Guess it will just cost me some printer ink as some one has already created a set for printing ... Still wish the company would do it though as standard ...they are so necessary for this game given all the small and larger sub-sets in the cards it speeds up set up and put away time etc 

But this minor gripe certainly does not distract from this most excellent game though ...

The card stock could be a little better quality. I know that the comic style artwork put me off in the beginning but it actually works when you begin to play the game. The playmat is fantastic and all similar type card/deckbuilders should have one!!!

Gameplay is good. Mission structure is very good and makes sense from a narrative point of view.

Am really enjoying this at the moment - this is perhaps the best 1 player deckbuilder in my collection.

Thunderstone Adv has a much better organising system because the dividers are labelled so it is easier to know what to do. Thank God I found a video on YouTube or I would never have figured set-up and box layout.

I am looking forward to playing this with a few more people and seeing what happens when a character gets chestbursted or has a certain agenda...

RATING: 8.5
10+ plays - A great team game. A lot of fun and if you know the movies, it's even better. The mat is what really makes the game imo. The cards have some neat mechanics that interact with the mat in various ways that really make it feel quite thematic. In my opinion, a pure card game where you really "feel the theme" is pretty unique. 

The tension is always there, with the pressure mounting at various points, all the way until the end. Scanning the ship, only to find a missing part instead of ravenous alien (just as things are getting really 'hairy') is a fantastic gaming moment :D

The card organisation is a little tricky the first time, but I can pack this game up and down eerily fast now - label your dividers!

RATING: 6
Legendary Encounters is a cooperative deckbuilding game.  Monsters and other threats (as well as mission objectives) come out in a queue, and as they reach the active area, you have to deal with them or take wounds every round.  You can buy cards from a replenishing pool, and the cards have icons that make them work well in combination (though the effect of this seemed limited to me).  Some cards can be loaned to other players in an attempt to simulate cooperation.  This game clearly isn't aimed at me, as I'm a fan of neither cooperative games nor the Alien franchise. That said, I guess it did the things you'd want a deckbuilding coop to do. But I'm not the best judge here.

RATING: 8
Far superior to Marvel Legendary. I really didn't care for that game, but this is superb. The artwork is well done, the cards are fun and the objectives unique. I worry a bit about the replayabilty, but the movies can be mixed and the locations changed as well as the character cards to buy.

I think this game gets easier with fewer people, but each time I've played, it's been a great ride.

Update: Hell, after playing two 3 player games, we got smoked on Alien. I think this game can get really hard depending on card draws, cards from the barracks and just an unlucky order of scans. I found keeping up with scanning to be incredibly important. You NEED to be on top of it to see what is coming before it gets into the combat zone and you than HAVE to deal with it.

This game is a must-have for any fan of the Alien franchise. Like other deck building games, Alien comes with a substantial amount of cards with some really great artwork. Additionally, players also get a very large custom mat, also with lots of great artwork. Plays up to 5 people and allows users to play through the various movies (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection). Dying isn't the end of this game either. Players who receive a facehugger and the sometimes inevitable chestburster can come back as the dreaded Xenomorph to attack the other survivors. Highly recommended.

First scenario is HARD!
One play still leaves vivid memories  - the gunner and tech were kicking ass and had completed objective 1 and 2 with very little damage when the ship crashed (hazard 2 pulled top card of hive into confrontation area - hazard 3).  
The impact killed the gunner and seriously wounded the tech, who was then taken out by two skittering aliens.  
Awesome adventure!

I've you've played Legendary Marvel, there's a lot you'll recognise about this game. Essentially, this game is a deck builder where players buy new cards from a belt of cards, hoping to accumulate combos for the future, which will be used to defeat the belt of enemy cards. Each scenario has special rules for victory, which in this case is themed for the various Alien movies.

The art is a little weak to what I'm used to from reading Dark Horse Alien comic books from the 80s and 90s, but it's reasonably standard for a game in the Legendary series. Mechanically, I enjoy that this game is fully co-op as opposed to the strange system in the main Legendary games line where you are working together but also fighting for the most points. To that end, there's an awesome little mechanic here that allows you to assist another player during their turn by playing your assist card and then redrawing, helping you to cycle around to your better cards. Another fantastic element is that players have a character card which however much health, and wounds just stack up at the side of your board, rather than crapping up your card draws.

I liked Marvel Legendary, but I got annoyed by the semi-co-op nature, plus the unwieldiness of all the expansions, plus the focus on 90s characters and art really got to me. Legendary Alien brings along none of that baggage and doubles down on the things I liked about the game.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional

A fun and pretty thematic deck building game. I definitely like it better than Marvel Legendary, mostly because of the Coordinate cards that add in more to think about during other people's turns and give the game more of a truly cooperative feel.
There are some issues that keep it from being great, though. The theming is a bit weird in that it's unclear what the player is, thematically. You aren't one of the characters, because you are buying cards with multiple characters on them. You aren't some external agent. It's not a huge deal, but it keeps the theme from really feeling real. Also, while there are more meaningful decisions than in Marvel Legendary, there is a lot of randomness in the game, and at higher player counts it can feel very hard to improve your situation by playing well. There just aren't that many decisions to make during each turn.

This game uses its theme perfectly to take what could be  a middle-of-the-road game and make it really atmospheric. Played both the Alien and Aliens scenarios, and had a last minute loss and a rapid destruction respectively.

In-box deckbuilding games are not my favourite genre, but this one is the best I played.
The brand is clearly strong and the mechanics - although nothing original - are well done and you feel the deck working, if well made. A good surprise.

About components, the box is quite rich and complete, covering in theme all 4 Alien films. I like the artwork and the mat is very good. The box has a good 'collector' feeling.

RATING: N/A
As a semi-cooperative alien deckbuilder, I really expected this to be bloated, confusing, and imbalanced. After one play, I was very happy to find that it was none of these things. It was relatively easy to understand the options I had on my turn, and I felt that the decisions were usually non-obvious. I have never seen any of the Alien movies and I do not typically enjoy alien themes in games, but I did have fun playing this game.

I also want to give props to the coordinate mechanic. I consider this mechanic an absolute triumph of design, and I wouldn't be surprised to see future games steal it. The choice between helping yourself or a potentially traitorous ally is phenomenally engaging. We've seen this explored in games such as Battlestar Galactica before, but Legendary's clean implementation is the best yet, and  the coordinate cards are very important to the group's success, giving the game great tension.

There are other good things to talk about. The damage system provides a sense of danger while being very easy to understand. The rules are MOSTLY clear, as far as game rules go. A few minor negatives: setup/teardown is annoying, the order the enemies come out from the deck has a huge effect on ability to win, and the complexity is just a bit too high to play with non-gamers who love the movies, but without all those elements, the game wouldn't be as engaging, so honestly there is nothing ti complain about here. 

Put it all together, and it's almost impossible to believe that this thing comes from Upper Deck of all companies. Consider this their announcement that they are joining the big leagues.

I'm not a deck building fan, and didn't really like Legendary Marvel, but this adds abit more.  I'm a big fan of the Aliens movies which helps and the mechanics of this deck builder suits it.  The intensity not knowing what cards are coming until they reach the combat zone makes more sense.  You can even play as the alien if you die, there's even a hidden agenda where there's a traitor amongst your group.  So many ways to play this game that adds to the replayablility.

My favourite deckbuilder so far (not that I've played a lot of deckbuilders).

Also, of all the games I've played based on films, books, comics, etc, LE: Alien is the best at capturing the spirit of the original. And I'm including some full-blown RPGs in that.

Biggest flaw: Difficulty scales poorly with player count. (solo is "squad of ultimate badasses", four is "express elevator to hell", five is "game over, man, game over")

The art is a weak point. Not awful, overall (see LE: Firefly), but there's a couple of really bad cards (Buying Time being the worst) and quite a few mediocre ones.

I may be more of a superhero/comic book fan at heart, and not really that big of a fan of the Alien franchise, but this is the best thing to come from the Legendary game line, and possibly Upper Deck's greatest work yet. I love that players have their own special roles. In Marvel, I never felt like I was actually the heroes, but here I really feel like part of the action. I'm not usually a fan of player elimination, but I wouldn't have it any other way with this game. Using the variant to allow an alien player is great.this is probably the most thematically tense experience I've ever had with a board game.

A clever and thematic deck builder.  The first mission is a bit too easy, but when the scenarios are harder the game can be very tense.

Played solo, it is a little weak since you don't have much choice about what cards to buy -- since they only go away when you buy them, they sit there until you eventually put them in your deck.  With 2 or more players, there is at least a choice of who gets the card.  In a solo game, try adding "if you buy no cards, kill the entire HQ".

17-06-2015. Sold after 7 plays. I felt I got enough of the game. I like it, but it's not a game that feels fresh and interesting anymore. I still like it and would play again.

13-06-2015. Rated after 5 plays. Alien Encounter is the evolution of a game system I previously played and did not really enjoyed but felt was ok. Aliens changes the system.
You start the game by building a Hive deck and the Barracks, which based on the movie you want to play or random if you want to do that.

Each turn, you move a card from the Hive deck, a deck filled with Aliens, Hazards and events, facedown into the Complex. If there is no empty slot, the previous cards slide down towards the Airlock or combat zone if the Complex is fully filled. 

In  your action phase, you buy new cards and play cards for damage. There is also a cool mechanism with special abilities you can trigger by playing them if the types of previous cards align. Another cool twist is that you can coordinate with other players, allowing them to play an exact copy of the card you have and you replacing it with a new card. Interesting.

Then, if there are enemies in the combat zone they attack. Damage is random, but can consist of facehuggers that can mutate into chestbursters that can kill you in a later turn.

This game is very cool. I am no big fan of Aliens OR of Legendary, but this game has warmed me up to the system. It's good, I enjoy it and I think it's excellent.

Remember in the original Alien movie where hoards of aliens were overrunning the ship? Yeah, me neither. So, if you liked Aliens 2, then the game fits the theme. If not, pass on this game.

Thematically, the Character cards are still weak. I never felt like I was playing a character, or group of characters when playing my deck. 

*****

L:E Alien implements Aliens 2 better than Alien, because of the different types of Aliens in the decks. You explicitly have a character now, but I still don't get what the cards of the personalities represent. Are they NPCs who are running around back and forth between my and the other player's groups of soldiers? Are they fighting techniques that the name on the card told us how to do? Are they magical spirits whom we summoned and take their mystical powers as we fight evil? (The last sounds the most plausible since most of these guys are... dead.) Oh, and watch out for facehuggers when you scan!

I love the stacked objectives that give this game a sense of progression and story over time.  It feels tense and even though it doesn't feel like the most strategic of all deck builders, I still quite enjoy it.

The only big hit on this one (like many other games) is that there are 500+ cards and they start to show wear VERY quickly.  I feel like sleeving is a must, but I also don't want to buy that many :(.

This game shines in many aspects: excellent deck building mechanism, growing tension, high replayability. 

Moreover, the Alien franchise gives it a strong theme.

I like the fact that the game can be faced starting with the solo mode, then enlarging to a collaborative mode and finally
arriving at the full competitive mode.

Solid game. Seems to fix the only issue I had with Marvel Legendary - that the end game was too wonky. Maybe less inherent variability than Marvel, or leans more to a tendancy to play the classic movie scenarios? Shame that scalability is a bit of an issue - I'd mostly just want ot play this with 4 or 5.

RATING: 8.5
I'm not a big fan of classic deckbuilders like Dominion. Ok, I really just kinda hate Dominion (I like many others like Trains, Paperback, and Fantastiqa, that add something besides building your deck alongside each other). This one is a little different. It really is mostly just deckbuilding, but what really makes this for me are (a) the theme and atmosphere and thematic arc (actually a kind of three act structure like a movie), and (b) that it's cooperative, and not just on paper (like e.g. the Elder Sign base game). The coordinate cards are a really clever idea and make you feel as though you really are lending someone a hand and not just everybody doing what they are best at, as most other coops. 
Am really itching to try the Agenda card semi-coop variant.

Wow, the best-themed game of all time? OK, that's up for debate, but this is a fantastic, tight game that exquisitely distills the tension from the films while making tons of fun mechanics. There's a lot of game in this box; I still haven't played with one of the scenarios; Alien Resurrection, and I still haven't played with agendas or the Alien player variant. After all of that is done, I wonder if the 9 will hold (and I'm also not sure if BGG's definition of a 9+ being a game that should always wanted to be played; is it ok for a game to be a total experience, and then never be played again? Will that be the case with Legendary Encounters?)

Definitely a good game.
Reminiscent of earlier deck builders like Thunderstone, this masterpiece is a lot more polished than its predecessors.
The theme and mechanics are integrated together seamlessly, granting a truly captivating game experience.

 - Fast set up (once the initial organization of the contents is complete). 
 - Interesting and effective decisions to be made throughout all phases of the game.
 - Strong narrative, creating your own unique story.
 - Build up of tension through the session as encounters grow tougher and you hope your previous decisions will give you the might to defeat them. 
 - The ability to plan for and mitigate the random confrontations and events that get thrown at you.
 - Medium play time that allows multiple games in a session.

I expect to exhaust the core game sometime in 2018, so really looking forward to getting the expansion to fill my time for the following four years.
Although, I probably will be playing it again from the start, by then! 

Finally doing the whole Mix 'n' Match thing has revitalised this game for me.
Although I think of myself as a purest and disliked the idea of deviating from the movie scripts, the change in card interactions gives you new challenges and dynamics.
The games are just as enjoyable and still provide the interactions and decisions to experience an legendary saga.

Wow. I wasn't sure I would enjoy this as I have never seen the movies and the theme didn't appeal to me. But this is a very solid and fun game. If you enjoy deck builders and co-ops, you must give this a try. Hell, you should give it a try regardless. 

One negative note- the hundreds of cards did not come organized in our copy whatsoever. It took 30 minutes or more just for us to sort the cards into the appropriate decks. So be prepared for that. Once it is done though, you won't need to deal with it again.

A solid game with lots of challenge from the four Alien films, but the original artwork is a very mixed bag and sadly quite off-putting. Frankly, despite some grisly content on a few cards, it looks like a kids game. The Dark Horse comics series, any of them, put the ugly visuals here to shame and there's no excuse for it. It may even have been better to aim for straight stills from the films. Such as it is, even if you love Aliens, you would do well to take a look at the cards first before you shell out for the game. It could be a deal-breaker.

This is a fantastic game and honestly is the best implementation of the Legendary system. The artwork is a mixed bag, but it's still much better than some of the other games Upper Deck has released. It does a great job of mirroring the foreboding fear that is a hallmark of the films. However, the one thing that holds it back for me is the variety. You essentially play through the four films and while those are extremely well done and enjoyable, I feel like I've already experience everything that this game has to offer. While not as good, the Marvel version has so much variety that I don't know if it's possible to play them all. That game just works better for me and in an effort to save shelf space, one had to go.

I should start of by saying that I am a huge fan of the Alien Franchise so this game really hits the sweetspot for me!

Nonetheless, I feel that if you like co-op games this is an absolute MUST have .. we never get tired of playing this game. It's different every time and it really gives you that feeling of "How are we going to survive this".

Hidden agenda's and alien players can make everything even more difficult but even then, you're guaranteed to have an awesome time!

We are the point now where we are combining character decks, objectives & enemies just to create our very own experience.

With the expansion on the way and the predator game that just came out this becomes even more of a draw.; as you can mix these games together for an ultimate AvP experience.

Much better version of the Legendary system, now fully co-op. Probably one of the few deck builders with a theme as various face down monster cards slowly move towards the combat zone(where they will flip and activate...not good for your health) with you being totally clueless unless you spend previous attack value to scan them to reveal and then hopefully kill them. Has co-ordinate ability in cards which enhances the co-op aspect. Overall, if you like the legendary system and wanted a better co-op system absolutely go for it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
On of my favourite co-op games in recent memory. I haven't played Marvel Legendary so it's hard to compare but I really enjoy the deck-building aspect to this. I'm also a big fan of the Alien movies so that contributes a lot to my enjoyment of this.

I really like how enemies come out and creep across the board before being revealed and how that builds tension. The different scenarios are also really cool.

My biggest complaint against the game is simply the fact that the cards come COMPLETELY OUT OF ORDER and it took me almost 2 hours of sorting to get them separated properly (it's not clear at all how the cards should be organized when you first get the game). It was a nightmare to figure out/sort before we could play the first time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This takes the deck building genre, re-skins it with a cool theme, and turns it into a co-op experience to relive the Alien movies and survive.  I really like the hidden cards that need to be exposed, the multiple stages of the board that threats pass through, and the variation in threats.  My only gripe is I would like to see more depth in the deck building aspect.  Most of what I've seen in play are bulky, shallow engines versus the leaner and powerful equivalents like what you might see in a Dominion game.

I recall seeing the movie when it first came out.  It was one of my seminal movie moments along the likes of the first Star Wars movie.  The game is challenging and evokes the atmosphere of the movie nicely.  I highly recommend this game.   I'll tell you a secret.  If you store all the cards from each movie together, including the recommended characters, objectives etc etc the setup and take down is a breeze.  5 minutes to set up and 7 minutes to put away.  This system has saved me countless hours.

RATING: 8
If you are familiar with Marvel Legendary, this is a re-skin of the game in the Ridley Scott Alien universe with a few rules variations.

The main heft of the game is the same.  There is a deck of "heroes" (in this case characters from the four Alien movies) that you draft into your personal deck.  Each round you play your hand of cards to generate attack and buy power to buy more heroes or attack the bad guys which enter a line of locations from another deck.  The heroes all display the same symbols from Marvel Legendary that fuel the powers of other heroes the same way.

So what is different?  First all the heroes take on a specific identity.  These identities set a player's health, armor (only used in an advanced play mode), and give each player a special card to start.  Also, enemies enter the board face down and need to be scanned with attack power based on the location they are in before you can attack them.  The game also is won or lost based on 3 objectives and the enemy deck has many different cards in it from aliens you fight to obstacles related to the objective to Facehuggers.  That's another addition, if a player gets a Facehugger they have 2 turns to defeat it (and sometimes you get it at the end of a turn after you've already used all your cards so you really only have one, this happened to me in my first game) or they add a Chestburster card to their deck.  When the Chestburster card is drawn the player dies and becomes an alien player playing against the other players.

You can also play that the Chestburster card just kills the player instead of transforming him.  We played that it turned that player into an alien because that's more fun, especially for the player who would have to just sit out otherwise.  However this presents a very Shadows Over Camelot-esque problem.  I often felt Marvel Legendary was a bit too easy out-of-box.  This game seems to address that a bit and feels a bit more challenging even with everyone playing cooperatively.  The alien players really skew this though.  They get to play 6 cards a turn, all of which really ruin the other players days.  It was incredibly difficult, bordering on impossible for players to make any progress once an alien player is in the game having to fight against the game itself and another, extremely powerful, disruptive force.

All in all, the changes from Marvel Legendary all seem for the better.  I like the atmosphere it creates and the game feels a lot more focused in the experience it is trying to present to the players.  I will say the theme is one that I'm less interested in/familiar with than Marvel super-heroes.  I've seen 3 of the 4 Alien movies but they never really grabbed me so I care a lot less and even barely know any of the characters I draft into my deck in this game.  That does dock it some in my eyes but it is still a great game experience.

It may be worth mentioning that this game can be combined with some parts of the Marvel Legendary game and vice versa but the rules for that are a little hokey, it's probably best just to keep them separate.  But the options is there if you just really want Ripley and Spider-Man to team up against Dormammu and a Xenomorph.

Having played this solo, it's a pretty hard game. However, don't let this keep you from buying it!

I haven't got the chance yet playing its Marvel and Predator counterparts, but the theme and mechanics in itself are wonderfull and really gets you going. If you have the 2 other games, you can even use them if you wish! You can go for AvP or just using Deadpool or his friends to beat up some Aliens! 

If you don't have the other games, don't worry you'll be able to play through all 4 films! You can change objectives or characters how you see fit making the replayability pretty high.

The game is hard enough as it is, but it still gives you the opportunity of making it easier or harder by adding or leaving out specific cards.

I'd suggest getting the cards sleeved though, hence I'm only giving it a 7. (pricetag goes up this way if you need to buy around 500 sleeves)

This game is close to absolute drek.  I might play another person's copy if I were convinced, but it's highly unlikely.  I just didn't see any real balance here.  The game is fun with 3 players, but too hard with 4 and nigh impossible with 5 players without tweaking the rules.  Both of my plays with 4 players ended in sound and utter defeat before we even reached the third objective in Alien.  There is just too many bad cards too fast to be able to appropriately build your decks to deal with it before it overwhelms you.  I would like to give it another shot to see if it was just a myriad of bad experiences (we aborted our sole 5 player game when it was abundantly clear we could not win), but I doubt I will have a better experience.

RATING: 5.5
Clever co-op deckbuilding game descended from Ascension, most notable for its somewhat successful attempts at thematic integration. The structure of the game is relatively straightforward: on a player's turn they draw an enemy card, which joins the queue advancing towards them along the station track. Enemies turn face up either when they reach the end ("combat zone") or when a player ability scans one. Some cards are instant events etc. or otherwise have abilities when revealed, so scanning is not without risk. Cards remaining in the combat zone after a player's turn hurt them, requiring damage cards to be drawn from the strike deck.

The pile of cards players can buy from is assembled by combining smaller decks of cards representing characters from the film; the enemy deck is built from three smaller decks representing key plot points. In its most thematic format, players can roughly follow the plot of the first four Alien films, but of course the sub-decks can be mixed and matched for alternate-universe variety.

The theme does work relatively well. The enemy deck structure ensures that the difficulty ramps up quickly, and early tension (and a nice thematic twist) comes from the facehugger cards, which can appear suddenly and must be dealt with immediately; if they stay too long, the affected player puts a chestburster in their deck, which instantly kills them when drawn. (A variant allows a player thus afflicted to continue on as an enemy alien.)

As a game it is only light or medium weight and randomness plays a significant role. Damage from the strike deck ranges from 0-5, which does add tension to the draw but also makes survival a total crapshoot. Significant variation (Ascension style) in the character deck likewise makes achieving card synergies potentially challenging; some cards are unique and will very likely never turn up in any given game. To smooth out this randomness the design leans heavily on the ability of players to lend certain cards out in other players' turns, but no allowance is made for the number of players available to do so (for obvious reasons fewer in a 2p than a 5p game). 

Ultimately it's thematic chrome on an uninteresting engine and players' enjoyment is contingent on their enjoyment of making a story out of random events. I would suggest a roleplaying game instead.

One minor annoyance is the hugely painful setup and teardown, which is compounded by failure to spring for different backs for different types of card. This is not a game you want to play 600-card pickup with.

I have fallen in love with this game, going strictly co-op has proven to be much better for the Legendary franchise as the game can crank up the difficulty, also the Coordinate mechanic is a great addition that works so well.  Theme comes through loud & clear & haven't had a bad game yet.

Best thematic game I've played (and I'm a theme junkie). You can teach this game almost entirely through an understanding of the Alien(s) universe. 

Detracting a half-point due to how imbalanced the alien player rules are, and the lack of organization inside the box.

RATING: 8
It fixed everything I didn't like about Legendary's previous games. I'm now anxious to see the Predator version of this! My only problem with it is the recurring problem with missing cards (my copy was missing one, for example) and the way they come in the box - it takes a long time to sort everything in the right place, check if you have everything or if there are cards missing, and finally be ready to play.

My usual issues with deckbuilders aside, I'm really enjoying this. My wife seems to like it as well, which is cool. I like that there is a clear goal and enjoy the fact that it's co-op, as I've played too many deckbuilders where player interaction is a bit of an afterthought (dominion) or entirely unbalanced (star trek). Seems to work nicely.

Very thematic and captures the feel and dread of the constant onslaught of enemies.

Some card combinations can be overly powerful, and there doesn't feel to be as much strategy and interesting decisions to be made in the game as I'd like. Usually you just play all your cards and do the most obvious things (buy cards that work together, kill biggest threat, scan if nothing to kill).

Definitely fun though when just played casually and quickly. The biggest detractor is the long set up time though which is pretty brutal, even with dividers and everyone helping.

I just finished my first play of this game.  I was able to pick it up at my FLGS for cheaper than I can get it online so I grabbed it.  I really like Legendary (65 plays) and have read several reviews stating  that Legendary Encounters improves on the mechanics of the original.  One play is not enough to really tell, but I am impressed so far.  The objectives felt like the movie and feel more thematic to me.  I also like the fact that I can play as an actual character...wish Marvel Legendary could get an expansion that would allow for this as not feeling like I am playing as a superhero is one of my biggest disappointments with Legendary.  I played through the scenarios that correspond to the first movie and the designers did a much better job using the location rooms in Encounters...this was another aspect of Marvel Legendary that I thought could have been improved.  It's early yet but it looks like this is a better game.  I will still be playing the Marvel version a ton though because I enjoy the superhero theme more.  Oh yeah...I also like how the coordinate ability works and the fact that Encounters is a purely cooperative game.  That is three changes that I like better than the original.  I am curious about what type of expansions will come out for this game.  While there are a lot of ways to mix and match the objectives I might not be as interested in the game once I beat all of the "movies".

Thunderstone in space. Except you don't even have to make a decision whether to go to the village (shopping) or the dungeon (fighting) as you automatically do both. And there is no light parameter, but simply an increasing 'scan' cost to simulate a growing row of monsters to fight. Traps are simulated by events and hazards, treasures are the characters you find. So basically, it is a simplified version of Thunderstone.

Now, it does some clever things on its own, like adding attributes (like Vigilante) to your cards so you can manage your tableau even better. Also it introduces a 'Coordinate' mechanism which basically bogs down to 'always play it' as you get a replacement draw (hence every decent deckbuilder knows this will speed up your deck as well, so it is an automatic thing to do) and just pick someone you think can use it. Also, the Facehugger mechanism is a nice touch. These suddenly pop up into your face and you have to kill them immediately or else face inescapable death in the near future.

Luckily, that will almost never happen, as the biggest drawback of the game is that sadly, it is too easy. Monsters don't go into your deck, so you can tune your deck way better as in Thunderstone. The result of that is that if you follow the default route of deckbuilding (start culling as soon as possible, focus on cards that increase your spending power early on and just over half the game start focusing on the 'battle' cards) , by objective 2 you 'control' the game, meaning you've cleared out the Complex and just finish off whatever poor bastard will show up next as soon as there is a new one. As there is no way to 'speed up' the game, this becomes a boring, repetitive affair as you wait for the final wrench that might spice things up, but have to go through the repetitive motion of draw, buy cards (or pass on that), finish up, redraw. And as there is no way to 'cycle' the HQ (the shop), you are not even being rewarded for being in control. Blegh.

Finally, I feel the setup for the players is simply not diversified enough. You have no special abilities of your own, just one card in your starting deck of 14 will differ. Big whoop. In Sentinels of the Multiverse, another coop card game going up against the bad guys, you get a whole deck of different cards, PLUS a unique power to take with you. Here you're basically the next dude, save that one card.

Theme wise, it is done very nice. Artwork is done well and with a playmat the game absolutely looks gorgeous. But this is not enough to salvage my gripes of Alien: Legendary Encounters. As far as the mechanics go, I like Star Realms for its simplicity and quick playing time. Thunderstone for the meater 'build your deck' experience, and Sentinels of the Multiverse better as a cooperative game because of the asymmetric abilities this game lacks. 

This game? For trade.

mechanics arent original and this game takes up a lot of time without asking anything more than doing the simple math required of similar deck building games. I did not get a chance to study the roles and cards in the game and perhaps with more experience deeper strategy and more immersion might emerge, but I am not willing to invest the time. If you like this sort of game you might like it, very few rules questions, good art, reasonably exciting, so it works on that level 9.10.17 burger joint w/ grant spencer

Very good solo experience that puts you right on board the USCC Nostromo, Hadleys Hope and other film locations (in the forgettable sequels) and really gets the atmosphere pumping! Deck building buffs your ability to fight off the marauding alien menace which stalks you unseen.... but this takes time and builds the tension - will I be ready when the beasts come?! 

Listening to the Alien soundtrack enhances the mood - and - when playing solo I use it as a game timer (my variant) whereby the game is lost if the sound track finishes before the main objective is completed. Added stress! 

I have also played this twice at 5 players which felt more clunky probably because he others were learning which meant that the play wasn't as smooth. Still enjoyable tho.

Overall... A very good game!

tl;dr: it's what you'd expect

Take basic deck building. Inject it into a co-op game. Take the theme of one of the Alien movies and paste it on the cards (with little connection between the name of the card, the art and the function). You get this game. I like deck building. I like Alien. I'm OK with co-op. But of course that last part is the main part. It's kind of like [thing=30549][/thing]: everyone has a special ability, and you work together to fight the game that does a good job of undoing any progress you make.
It's all fine, but it didn't grab me at all. The theme felt really pasted on to me.
I wouldn't say no if someone would ask me to play again, but I probably won't request this.

Legendary is a good co-op deckbuilding engine, and I'm given to understand that this is the best incarnation. The tension is good and meshes well with the theme. My main active complaint is that it's hard to get consistent, as thinning cards are rare, and the game actually seems to perform better with 2 or 3 than with 4, simply because decks will cycle more so each individual buy gets more play.

I suppose it's also an issue that Legendary put all their component budget into the nice mat, and didn't provide labelled dividers or cards with rounded corners. Setup can take a little while with this game.

Contrary to what I thought when first learning many boardgame genres and mechanics, deckbuilder games are not really my favorite style of game(or maybe I just haven't played the right one). Alien does a pretty good job at making it to where you have to co-operate to do better and it is fun to take out all of the aliens and finish the game and feel like you completed the story. I like it but I don't love it will report back after more plays.

One of the best mechanics to theme integration I've ever experienced. It also has everything a great co-op needs; a fair amount of difficulty which can be adjusted, potential traitors, role cards with different abilities and immersive gameplay. You feel like you are playing through the movies. The tension is palpable. Epic recreations of Ripley vs the Alien Queen in a duel not forced, but made available via gameplay mechanics. The objectives are really well designed. I particularly love the hidden cards that move, eg the 'complex' system. The traitor system isn't the best, and the deckbuilding also isn't super amazing, but everything else about this game is.

This is a fun, thematic, and fast-paced co-op game.

Legendary Marvel is one of my favorite deck-builders, so I was annoyed to see all the rankings putting this one higher.  It seemed like that couldn't be possible, even though I love the Alien franchise.  Man, I was wrong.  The choices are more interesting, the gameplay is more difficult, and the overall idea of what you're doing makes more sense.  I cannot wait to play and integrate the Predator set!!

One note: just like the Marvel version, this game is a total bear to store, set up, and take down.  Consider yourself warned.

*** Update: played the first 3 movie plots constructed in the box and I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS GAME.

*** Second Update: I have now played through all four pre-constructed movie scenarios and hold fast at a nine rating.  Such a great game.  I've played solo only so far, and highly recommend you play as multiple characters while in solo play to get the full effect of the Coordinate cards. But I can't wait to get this to the table with the group, and work our way up toward the advanced rules where some players can be aliens and betrayers.

I was interested in this game because of my Marvel Legendary addiction. I wanted to see if the game held up even though I'm not as into Alien as I am into Marvel. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked the game. For one, aside from the straight mechanics of the game, it is a very different game from its Marvel counterpart. Unlike Marvel, there's a constant sense of terror and a horrific sense of helplessness. Even Thanos makes you feel like you just might beat him, in Alien you're trying desperately not to die. The theme is far from pasted on, it feels very much like the movies, but you don't have to know the movies chapter and verse to play. Great game.

Biggest flaw of this game is deck setup.  I've only played 2 or 3 times and the main reason is setup time.

The game is difficult (as a co-op should be) and the theme is just dripping out of the box.

A surprisingly good deck building coop game.

Pros: Super fast gameplay for an otherwise quite rewarding game combined with a fairly fast setup and increased difficulty creates a "let's go for another one" spirit. Dark and very armospheric - the theme works miracles. Cooperation is essential and very well supported, players can't play by themselves. Very fun and agonising gameplay. Serious decisions that are not obvious initially. A very simple game system that is easy to learn and get into that is however stretched to its total strategic limits and as a result allows for great variability and strategy. Excellent flow of play and pacing. Extra modes (traitor and may turn into allien modes) are welcome.

Cons: It's still a very basic system, mechanics wise. Why the rule "When a player is killed the others have one last round to finish the mission" is optional in coop mode is beyond me. Player elimination was a serious issue in our games until we added it.

Overall, it's a very fast and enjoyable, if fairly simple, cooperative game.

RATING: 9.5
This one combines my favourite film franchises with one of my favourite mechanics, deck-building. While I really liked Marvel Legendary, it had some problems and I didn't like the theme, which is strange since I really love Marvel comics. When Alien was announce I had my reservations but those quickly went away when I tried the game. It feels so thematic. Everything from the Chestburster in your deck to the (optional) hidden traitor and Alien player is just right. We've played this game so much and it still manages to beat us, which is really good for a coop game. 

Despite some of the games issues - flimsy cards, bad/inconsistent art and a long setup/tear-down time - I still love it and even frequently play it solo. In fact, it's probably my most-played solo game - though, to be fair, I actually don't play a lot of solo games. 

When played at my game group, we frequently play with both the hidden traitor AND Alien player modules and it's a hoot. We always end up quoting the film too, which, for me, just makes it even better. Definitely one of my favourite coop games out there.

Also own expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I was really excited to play this game, as cooperative games are my favorite kind, and this title had a lot of buzz regarding its quality. And I'm pleased to say it lived up to the hype. [thing=146652][/thing] is a good game, with some neat mechanics - the way the enemies and events run by the locations hidden is neat and tense, as we can see the threats advancing, without knowing what they are, unless we scan the place, which can, in turn, lead to even more nastiness. The game play is mostly the same as in Legendary - deckbuilding with two "currencies" - attack (to kill the aliens) and influence (to acquire new cards). Cards to purchase come all from the same deck, and a new one is revealed after one in the track is taken. 

[thing=146652][/thing] is based in scenarios, mostly similar to the movies - in the first scenario, Nostromo, for instance, the final goal is to kill the Perfect Organism. Once the enemies reach the combat zone, they will start to attack the players, making them, on their turns, to draw from the strike deck, which will, most of the time, cause injury to the characters - if the damage reaches the total HP of characters, he/she will be killed, and out of the play. There is another possibility: if a Facehugger isn't killed while it is in the play area, a Chest Buster will enter the character deck, and if it is drawn by the player, the character will be killed, but not out the game - he/she will start to play for the enemy!

The decisions are all that hard to be made - is mostly which card to buy (usually vying for combos, using cards of the same icon, like in regular Legendary), which enemy to attack and/or where to scan. Scan is done blindly - there is no way to know what will appear (and, well, how could be otherwise, right?). Which alien to attack is often given, either because there will be only one, or because if you have a lot of attack, you will normally attack the alien that is tougher to beat - this is only slightly changed when there is a Facehugger showing, as, as mentioned, these could became nastier than most.

There is plenty of luck of the draw: in the players deck, in the draw deck and in the enemy deck - in this last one the goal cards are shuffled, much in the way it happens in [thing=30549][/thing], as the cards are divided and the goal cards are shuffled in the parts, so players know that X card is among the, say, first 10, and the Y card among the 11 and 20, and so on. The luck of the draw can be a little reduced by the addition of Coordinate cards - these can be played by other players during someone else's turn in order to double the effect of a card used - this, besides talking about the the best way to proceed (which place to scan, who to heal, and so on), is the cooperation in the game.

As one could expect, deck builders aren't really the best mechanic to create a cooperative game, as the very nature of a person building her own deck is mostly a solitaire business. The Coordinate card is mainly all the interaction allowed by the game. One player can't, say, put his character in front of other to protect it from damage, nor they can share ammo, or split to cover more ground (ok, this part is good that can't happen). Maybe this can occur in later scenarios, but I'm not holding my breath. Still, the Coordinate is key to win and, considering several cards have this key-word (including the Sergeant card, that is a basic card, always present), Coordinate can happen often, so there is definitely a sense of cooperation between players, even if not as much as some other games.

The cards are a little on the flimsy side, but the game mat is awesome - is made of rubbery canvas (maybe "canvas" isn't the proper word, but I can't think of another to fit), and it feels great (and it doesn't have "memory" - i.e.: it doesn't curve the tips).

The bad part of [thing=146652][/thing] is the player elimination, a mechanic that, while thematic (and is necessary to properly give a sense of dread), can lead to someone leaving early (as there are some high damage cards in the strike deck, dealing 4, even 5 damage at once) and just watching the game go on - however, a play last around 45 minutes, so isn't going to be all that bad, but is worth mentioning - it would be good if the rules allowed for a "killed" character to be actually just badly hurt, so, instead of drawing a full hand of cards, the player would draw, say, 3 cards - enough to still do some things, and be in the game, but still so weak as to be, sometimes, carried by the others(could be really thematic, as a bleeding character is taken foward by her teammates; so the strike cards would be given to someone else - enhancing the cooperative feel of cooperation).

Overall, [thing=146652][/thing] is a good cooperative game, dynamic and tense, that doesn't go "easy" on players, even in the first scenario. The rules and flow are easy to understand, specially if the players already know [thing=129437][/thing]. There is truly a feel of the movies in the game - the unknown approach of aliens, and then you see the blip in the scan, but you don't know if you will be able to deal with everything, even with help, as the aliens are some tough nut to crack, and the damage is pilling on.

I am withholding my rating for a few more plays, but this game reeks with theme.  I am a huge fan of the movies and I just love how the scenarios follow the movies.  Yes, it is hard, but I have been crazy lucky and only lost the first initial game that I was learning on.  I played solo and beat it barely.  Then, played with my son and we beat it reasonably.  However, again, I think we got some really lucky draws and saved a killing twice in the game by lucky draws.  I love the game so far.  Played a few more times and I still love the game and want to play more.  It is very easy to teach, a logical mechanic, and cool scenarios to explore that follow the movies.  I can't wait for the predator version as I am just as big of fan as this series.

A clever, cooperative deck-building game tailor made for fans of the Aliens films that captures the desperation of battling. Be prepared for a fearsome challenge, as the random order of the opposing cards can sometimes eliminate a player from the game: watch out for those Facehuggers! All four Aliens films can be reenacted via the scenarios included in the box, or create a random challenge by mixing and matching from all four.

"...we just got our asses kicked, pal!"

Brutally difficult. Surprisingly thematic. Much more player interaction that I'd expected with two separate traitor mechanics. Did I mention brutally difficult?

Component quality is excellent, the artwork captures the films brilliantly while avoiding cheap cast shots and film stills which can look tacky. The rulebook is clear and well presented.

The only real downside is the sorting and labelling dividers: took the best part of an evening and even now the set up/ pack up is still relatively long. The neutral character cards which make up your starting deck, as well as the 'drone' card, feel a little incongruous in terms of simulating the first two films.

That said, gameplay works superbly and will be familiar to anyone who has played other deckbuilders. The mechanics did a great job of capturing the escalating tension and bursts of frantic action which characterise the films. The objective, hazard and event cards add masses of thematic flavour. We got lots of fun out of the constant references to movie lines which the advanced HQ cards make.

This is an absolute beast of a deckbuilder for anyone who enjoys sci-fi /horror. Pretty essential for fans of the films.

Rarely have I seen a theme so well integrated in a game! This is really a stellar implementation.  The art is evocative and sets the mood perfectly. The mechanics blend so well and make for a tense experience.  The player mat is really cool. Though we had a few rules questions, I think the rules were as well written as they could be for a game this involved.  The only reason I don't rate it a ten is that I have to be in the right mood to play a game this intense.

Wanted this game since I First saw it in development. Unfortunately the cost was a mayor factor for not buying it. But I always talked about the game, and how I must have it and will buy it one day no matter the cost. Luckily for me I have Slavica, and Slavica surprised me in the most beatiful way possible. A few days ago one guy was selling the game for half it's price. Unfortunately by the time I saw his post on Igranje.org, he was already contacted by one of my friends who wanted to buy it for our game room. I was in the conversation on Facebook for buying the game where I stated that it is a very good and thematic game, and we should take the oportunity and buy it. Few others were againts so we decided not to buy the game. Then Slavica contacted this friend and arranged with the guy who was selling it to sell it to her. So when I got to Slavica after work two days ago, and after some time noticed the game among our other games, I was literally shocked. I totally froze, and the First thing that crossed my mind was that I must be dreaming. Luckily I wasn't and it was the best surprise i got in a very very long time if ever. I love you baby :-*

I never cared much about the Legendary Marvel game, but the Alien theme of this one got me interested enough to give it a go. I enjoy this game but I would still prefer [family=9974]Ascension[/family] or [thing=68425][/thing] over Legendary Encounters as a multiplayer game, or maybe [thing=147020][/thing] if I'd like something more confrontational. But Legendary Encounters is in my opinion a much better solitaire game than the mentioned games, and I acquired it mainly for solitaire play so I'm quite happy. To get the most out of the game when playing solitaire I'd recommend playing two handed. I have to mention that the play mat is absolutely superb. My game arrived with a missing objective card but Upper Deck replaced it within a couple of weeks. 

Update: Got boring quite fast. Happy to have traded it away.

This is the high point of the Legendary system so far. Although a good eighty percent of the game is unchanged from the Marvel releases, the mission structure and traitor mechanics take the fun factor to another level. I almost wish this game had come out first so that Marvel Legendary would have a better scheme system.

the only downside to the whole production is sorting the cards between games. It's kind of a pain in most deck-builders anyway, but the dark illustrations and absolutely microscopic mission labels make it extra difficult. That's really about all I have to complain about though, as otherwise it's almost perfect.

Only negative comment is, it is a BEAR when you first get the game and try organize it, and it took me a couple hours.  Also, missing cards is a common complaint, and I was missing one.  I just requested the card through Upper Deck and they sent it right away.  Overall, those issues were/are easy enough to ignore for all the pleasure I've gotten and will get out of this game.

Personally, I don't mind when new games are spun out as a re-tread from an existing game system.  In this case, the classic Sci-fi movie series is powered with the Legendary Marvel Superhero deck building system.  With some cool twists. I like that the threat cards are placed on the city track face down and that each player takes on a role.  Very challenging co-op. Another very cool twist is that some of the team MAY have taken on secret objectives as an antagonist (just like in the movies).

The most robustly-designed version of Legendary that I've experienced; I don't care about the Alien franchise, but the mechanics were so well-rounded that I was instantly hooked.  Very expensive, though, and the box has so much empty space that I managed to get all my other Legendary cards (not the board from the superhero version, though) into it.  Something this size will be hard to carry around if you don't have a car, and it didn't really need to be so big.

We've only tried the first two movie scenarios, but at the moment this is my favorite Legendary product.  I truly enjoy Marvel Legendary and its endless expansions, so this is a genuine surprise.

Our last game (Aliens scenario) was particularly amazing, to the point where I considered a rating of 9 rather than 'only' an 8.  Both other players had been killed, and I was left to survive on my own for 10+ turns.  But my deck was sufficiently well tuned with vicious attacks and Vigilant armor that I eventually managed to send Mother to the acidic alien afterlife.

Lots of Pros: The stacked Hive deck creates a nice progression through the movie storyline(s), the gameplay integrates neat thematic elements (e.g., sentry guns and ventilation shafts), each character has a special starting card, the Coordination mechanic is great, and four completely independent scenarios provide good value for the money.

A few cons: The game is supposedly impossible to win with 4-5 players, but we've heeded the community warnings and only played with 2-3.  The Alien scenario (#1) occasionally results in early player death (my insides are on the outside! that's bad!), which is frustrating for the player who gets knocked out in 10-15 minutes - particularly since it can be almost unavoidable.  Though we ignore the advanced 'transform into alien' rules, as the game is hard enough without a former ally becoming an active opponent.

Anyway, I'm extremely glad that I traded a grail game for this and Legendary Predator.  If Predator is as good as this one, the trade will go down in history as my best swap ever.

Alien also has me looking forward to the Legendary versions of Firefly and Big Trouble in Little China, which is unexpected (and hurtful, money-wise).

What I like of this game:
- I like Alien movies very much and this game catches the spirit very well.
- It's very very very easy to learn.
- It's very well balanced and you can adjust the difficulty to play it harder or easier.

What I don't like of this game:
- Count with 2 or 3 hours to sort all cards after unboxing. The box is a mess.
- Hundreds of cards and the box is terrible, I don't know how to store the cards, and you probably will have to make a custom box, or custom dividers to have the game organized.
- I don't understand what happens with the art, some cards are amazing and the characters are very well represented. But other cards are just...well I will try to be polite and just say awful.

Conclusion: The bad things are related to game "hardware" and the theme and mechanics are so good that this makes me have a great experience, so I give it a 9.

Love this! Very thematic, the suspense is always there, and the game is gloriously unapologetic about player elimination. It's hard, but fair, with plenty of options to set the difficulty where you like it to be. Sorting and sleeving before first play is a must, and an hour of two of work. After that, setup and teardown are alright, as long as you keep your head at it.

I loved the Alien movies and I feel that this is a wonderful tribute to them. Everything feels so thematic and there are lots of great opportunities for teamwork.

-- Sold: 6/29/16 - Not at all because it's a bad game, but you really only need one legendary encounter game and I wanted to go with the Firefly theme instead. If like you Alien more, then this would still be the right choice.

Deeply nostalgic game that captures the fear and terror of the movies well.  Unfortunately, player balance is off, as it doesn't scale properly (e.g. solo is way too easy, and 5P is nigh impossible), 3P-4P hits the spot.  My only wrinkle for this fantastic game.

Beginning to enjoy this more than I initially did. It's taking time to adjust to the lower power level compared to Marvel Legendary. I've grown fonder of this after 10 or so plays.

There's a lot of game in this box with all the predator stuff in there too, it weighs a ton. The expansion contains quite a few cards I can't see us getting to but I like the extra variety in characters and objectives.

What I really like about this game is the coordinate cards. Much more a "Aliens" Game than a "Alien" game though. I don't really feel much of a difference what you play the different movies. They all feel like the "Aliens" Movie, so the replay value isn't that high for me.

I would like to see another fully co-op Legendary game with coordinate cards, maybe with a Western, X-COM or Ghostbusters* theme.

*with all the characters from both the old and the new movie.

I've never played any of the other Legendary games.  But, as a HUGE fan of the Alien series, this game delivers.  I won't necessarily say it would be for everyone.  And some of the added optional gameplay elements don't work nearly as well as one would hope (the *turn into an alien when you die* thing never really happens, and the *hidden traitor* addition is BROKEN.  I'll have to look up an errata for how to play with the traitor...  it should work, but somehow doesn't....  hard to explain).  But as a co-op game goes, if you like the theme, you will enjoy this game.  I guess my biggest complaint is that, while I'm sure there are cool card interactions if you combine LE with some of the other Legendary games, by itself, some of the scenarios (ie, each movie) feel like they really only work internally.  When you mix them together, you often end up with cards that REQUIRE some interaction (such as the *coordinate* mechanic) that you just didn't accommodate for when you selected your character decks.  
But, it's not a deal breaker: if you're an Alien fan, you will really enjoy playing through the movie beats - even the ones you aren't a fan of.  The objectives are fun, and the theme is really there.
Word of caution though:  like everyone else who has ever reviewed this game sais, you CAN'T play this straight out of the box.  you NEED to set aside an hour to sort through the poorly organized cards.  It's not complicated, but it is akin to buying a piece of IKEA furniture and trying to piece it all together.  Without the instructions.  Blindfolded.    
Well, maybe not that bad.  But until you sort through, learn and organize the cards, it will feel like someone threw all the cards on the ground and told you to play 52-pick up.  with ~600 cards....
Ya.... Not cool.  Not cool.  Manufactures and designers take note:  this is how to potentially alienate (no pun intended) people from what is actually a good game.

Most enjoyable game I have played in a long time.  Richly thematic with constant tension due to the steady flow of unseen cards into the Complex.  A win really feels like an accomplishment, and a loss is not at all disheartening (dying to the Aliens feels appropriately thematic as well). 

There may not be much strategic depth to this game.  I think the most important decisions relate to recruiting strategy; ensuring the maximum opportunities for important combos and just as importantly, knowing when to stop recruiting so as to keep your deck as efficient as possible.  

However, for me this game is much more experiential than tactical, and on that level it hits a grand slam (in the bottom of the ninth, world series game seven no less)! 

Thanks!

A deck-building és az Alien kombó régóta izgatott, hálistennek nem is csalódtam. Tematikus és nagyon izgalmas játékmenet, gyönyörű rajzok, jól felépített szkenáriók.

Egy új játékban viszonylag korán meghaltam, így alienként folytattam tovább a partit. :D :D 
Hatalmas fun szívatni a többieket, és így a kieső sem unatkozik. Hatalmas ötlet!

Újabb két játék, egy kicsit feljebb is pontozom, nagyon tematikus, nagyon jó, mindig élmény vele játszani.

Lost first three player game on objective 3.
Bailey & I got through the first three movies. Won all of them...barely. Not so lucky on the fourth film. Thought we were doing well, cruising through the first two objectives. Third objective, dead. Fast.

Better than the Marvel legendary. It's more difficult to win and more exciting, a much better coop game, more different ways to play, more different artwork and more thematic.

Amazingly thematic and difficult deck builder. I love the Aliens franchise and this game really makes you feel like you're going through one of the movies.

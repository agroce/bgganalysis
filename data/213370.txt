A good-looking tile game with some neat ideas, but it feels like this design could bake in the oven longer.  The base game didn't have much to it and it didn't seem like the variants were anything worthwhile.

A very simple tile-laying game that may be good for younger ones to get into gaming and/or tile-laying games. I enjoyed it more than I anticipated because the scoring has a few aspects to it that keep it interesting. I felt like it was worth playing and it's nothing amazing.

This is a VERY light tilelaying game. I generally like tile laying games, but this one was too light i.e. there weren't enough interesting decisions. Actually, there is almost none to be made. On your turn, you draw one of the 9 face-up tiles and add it to your castle (I know you can also flip it face down, but that makes almost no sense to do). That's it.

What bothers me, besides this minimalistic and boring decision space, is the fact that you can always rearrange your tiles (as in rearrange ALL of your tiles ALL the time you want), which removes a bit of the tension. Also, the scores seem to be extremely close to each other, which is something I really dislike in most games as it's basically just a single tile that can make the difference. In one of my plays, I won on the second tiebreaker, and I believe that that's going to be a regular thing, which in my opinion undermines the whole game and scoring system... Oh, and speaking of scoring, because the scores are so close, you absolutely need flag tiles, otherwise you don't stand a chance of winning, and this again is something I heavily dislike; when you really don't have a choice as those tiles are so important.

The best thing about the game is the speed variant, which is probably the only way I want to play it going forward, and the only reason my rating is so high (if not playing with the speed variant, the game would most likely be a "3" for me). I like speed games, and this variant definitely adds some tension (and takes 5-10 minutes to play).

Played and then purchased.  Great quick tile-laying and castle-building game.  I love that you can rearrange your tiles any time and always.  Scales well and the artwork is very nice.  Bought for my daughter to play with her friends as it is very accessible to non-gamers.

Played twice 2-player against my daughter. I won the first and we tied the second game with no tiebreakers conditions present.  Not as easy as it seems, but oddly satisfying when you rearrange your castle to have legally-placed tiles and scoring opportunities.  I am very glad I purchased this!

Solo game is light and pretty fun. More challenging than I thought it would be.

Didn't much care for the 'rearrange your castle as you go' aspect of the MP, so we'll see if it gets played that way...

As a solo game, I think I'd give this a solid 7. As a multiplayer game, maybe a 5. The constant rearranging just really kills it for me.

Quite similar to Les Cabanes de M'sieur Robinson (2006), probably a game that flew way under the radar, but which I wouldn't rate lower. That one had objects and monkeys on the tiles as well, and players building on 3 huts, so the comparison isn't 100% of course.

Simple tile laying game where you are building your own castle in the sky. Enjoy the speed variant

However the scoring leaves much to be desired as there are no real choices except build the biggest complete castle you can.

Lots of fun. Being able to take your castle apart and rearrange everything is such a hoot. You get to the end of the game and you realize that you are stuck taking tiles you can't use. BUT WAIT!! If I rearrange this and move that and put this over here...Aha! It does work. The artwork is really cute.

Very puzzley tile placement-ish game. There are essentially 3 different "terrain" types on a tile: stone, wood, and marble [??]. There is also sky. The edge of one tile must match the edge of what is adjacent to it (ie: like Carcassone). HOWEVER, you may rearrange your tiles ANY TIME. The tiles can be any orientation with two exceptions: the starting gate and any tiles with a flag cannot be rotated, (but that makes sense with the art, so easy to remember).

This is one of the games that is very pretty for no reason. EVERY tile has different artwork, even if the type is functionally the same. (for example, the tile might be wood on all four edges, but one version might have a stained glass window and a another might have some little critters on it).

In the games I've played, our scores end up incredibly close--it is basically a puzzle of how to use all of the tiles you get (as that is the best way to maximize your score), but I don't really care--I have a ton of fun just arranging the tiles.

This game needs a much higher rating than BGG has assigned it--- its a brilliant fun game for all ages, not boring at all for veteran gamers.  Its like a puzzle and while the mechanics are quick to pick up, there is lots of thought with how you use the pieces, and variants to spruce it up too.  And it can play pretty quick.    Highly recommend.

In Castles of Caladale you are drafting tiles in order to piece together a whimsical castle made of stone, tree and plaster. Tiles have one or a combination of two of these materials on 1, 2, 3, or 4 sides. When you select a tile, you can try to fit it into your castle immediately ...or not. You can completely rearrange your castle at any time, setting pieces aside and adding them in later. There are two game-like decisions each turn - which tile to draft and whether or not to use it for your castle or turn it face down for 1 point. Tiles fitted into your castle are 2 points. Tiles you keep but can't fit are -1 and so on. The "game" is really just players building their own puzzles and drafting their next pieces. That's it! That's all there is to it. The rules even provide a timer and various different modes of play, which feels like stabs at trying to make a game where there isn't one. I predict in most households, kids will bag the game fast and simply use the tiles to build crazy castles. Not that that is bad, but it isn't a game. This is to be filed on your puzzle or toy shelf, not your game shelf.

RATING: 8
The inherently relaxing quality of tile-laying games is amplified here by the fact that players are allowed to move the tiles around after their initial placement. The art and the theme are both fun and the rules are simple. I wish the components were a bit sturdier, but I suspect some sacrifices were made in the interest of keeping the price on the very reasonable point at which you will find the game sold.

Fantastic tile laying game in the same vein as kingdomino, Carcassonne and Fjords but with the cool ability to rearrange your castle tiles throughout the game.  Nice artwork, large tile drafting pool, and really interesting designs when you're finished.  Already a family favorite.

RATING: 7
Interesting idea.   Tile laying is a satisfying mechanic for me typically.  Being able to rearrange your pieces at will seems at bit odd and would appear to lead to Analysis Paralysis in some which gives me pause on long term re-playability as this might get worse over time with my group always looking for a "more perfect" solution.   Artwork is adorable.   A bit too close to being multi-player solitaire for me to rate it higher.

A nice and relaxing tile placement game that is great for beginners and families.
It lacks an interesting scoring mechanism for it to have any actual strategy and scoring enjoyment.

It does however do something new to tile placement by allowing you to restructure all your tiles whenever you want. This does not work great in this game however, so while it's a neat idea, I can't say it was successful.

A big plus for the creative artwork to allow the players to create the interesting castles in the game.

A minus for overly complex rules for tile placement (bridges/bottom edge).

Fun family style game. I like the fact that you can rearrange the tiles in your castle, but I hate it as well. I spend a half an hour rearranging my castle before realising that I couldn't possible fit every piece in. Yes I took this game a little too serious.... The speed variant is fun, but you need te be lucky to build something quick that works. In the end a little too light for me, but I recommend this as a family game to play with your kids.

[b]Castles of Caladale[/b] was sold via auction 9/22/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I hadn't heard of Castles of Caladale when it came out, but once I did I thought it'd be a great game for my youngest daughter [i](she's 7)[/i] due to the simple rules and cute theme/artwork [i](faires, gnomes and wizards)[/i]. 

Castles of Caladale is a straight forward tile laying game with one significant difference. During the game you are taking turns selecting tiles from a common display and adding them to your castle. There are three types of structures, wood [i](inhabited by fairies)[/i], stone [i](inhabited by wizards and dragons)[/i]and Tudor [i](inhabited by gnomes)[/i]. Some of the tiles have a combination of two castle types. There are a few rules pertaining to how you build, but what sets it apart from other tile layers is that at any point you can rebuild your entire castle. This really opens up the game and makes it very family friendly. There is an included timer you can use at the end of the game if someone is taking too long finishing their castle, this hasn't been an issue in any of our games so far. 

My only concern has been how tight scores have been and whether or not the game would end in an inordinate amount of ties. So far this hasn't been the case, while scores are close there seems to be just enough room in the game, especially tower bonus points, to make it harder than you think to achieve a "perfect" score. There is also a speed variant which we haven't tried yet, I have a feeling it will change the scoring dramatically since you'll have the added challenge of trying to complete your castle under a time crunch. 

Overall I am very happy with Castles of Caladale, it is definitely a game I would recommend for families with younger children. My 7yo picked it up quickly and while she hasn't won yet she is having fun playing and really enjoys the building a castle versus some of the other tile laying games we've played. Castles of Caladale has replaced Lanterns in our collection; the combination of theme and mechanics, specifically being able to rebuild, has been a hit with all three of our kids.[/i]

I love tile placing games.  This is a cute family style game with very simple rules and mechanics.  Each round you are choosing a tile from a tableau of 9 tiles and then adding it to your growing castle or turning it over for 1 victory point.  This game is unique in that at any point you can rearrange your castle to the best possible structure.  Tiles are beautifully designed and of course have to match existing tiles in a logical way.  Game ends when all tiles are gone.  What you have left with is a beautiful castle ... well, it may not be beautiful but it will be unique!  Pints are scored for the number of tiles in your castles, whether or not you have sky all around your castle, and the number of castle tops indicated by flags.  Very simple game...fun to play, but honestly, was hoping for a little more.

I played this game once upon a prototype 4 years ago at TotalCon. I am not sure I could count it as having played before so this will be my first play. I like that you can play turn base or real time. Probably best with real time. I love the quick tile placement in building up this huge structure. It is a fun puzzle and plays super fast. I enjoyed my play and would like to play it again!

Tried this new tile laying game, Castles of Caladale recently. It's pretty mellow, low interaction, great artwork though enjoyable only to an extent. Caladale has the odd mechanic that you can rearrange your tile placements throughout the game essentially whenever you want, even during other players turns. Not my favorite in the tile laying genre. I much prefer Carcassonne, Cacao and Kerala to scratch this itch.

This is one of those games I so badly want to rate higher just based on how pretty it is.  This game looks awesome when you are finished.  The game is about building a castle from 3 different building materials.  Each round players draft a tile and match up the building materials in their castle to make it as complete as possible.  You can rearrange your tiles at any time and as often as possible.  You can also flip a tile when you receive it for half points which will probably only happen with the last couple tiles in any game.

At game end you get 2 points for each tile in your castle, one for each flipped tile, and bonus points for having sky all around your castle and each tower you placed.  The main problem with this game is the scoring.  Unless someone really screws up since you are able to rearrange your tiles at any time scores are going to be pretty close and the winner seems to be whoever drafts the most towers which can be completely luck based.  With so few scoring opportunities this feels less like a competitive game and more like just a simultaneous castle building activity.

There is a timed mode which might make scoring more interesting but I'm not really interested in playing this again to see.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played both ways with two players, and both games were fun, but we felt that scoring was largely dependent either on when the towers came out in the non-speed version as they were immediately snatched up, or based on who had more in the initial deal, or was faster at snatching them from the offer.  As the game weight is so light and it plays relatively quickly, we were able to overlook the luck based draw.  However, I think this game will only come out infrequently, when we aren't too concerned about playing a game where strategy is a larger factor.

As a house rule, we decided that towers do not score points, but will break ties. This seems to make the game more balanced, and makes it into a nice little puzzler, where towers are actually harder to integrate as they cannot be rotated, but do finish off a vertical construction.

Obtained this from Renegade Games as a preview for developing photographs for the game.  Game plays well, though I horrible at it.  It's largely a spatial awareness and tile-laying game.  I had a good time, but I'm really bad at games like this.

No real player-player interaction in the game.  Feels very solitaire like.

{1 play • 5 player} Great components, especially for such a little box.  The game, however, is just okay.  I liked the amazing simplicity of it, and it seemed like it was going to be perfectly light and fun... but, well... after you play a few rounds, there really isn't as much bluffing as you'd think.  And once players (well, the group I played with anyway) "get" it, everyone's pretty much doing the same strategy, so it seems to boil down to the luck of the "scoring" cards.  In the game we played, for instance, the leader after two rounds, was pretty much guaranteed the win because his last "scoring" card matched most of the rest of ours.  Of course, we didn't know this until after, so maybe that's something :)

A simple concept can make for a really strategic game.  I love the way you have to decide whether to burn a NO vote, or hope that someone else will do it for you.  There is a lot of great bluffing involved.  Much more strategy than you would expect with how simple the rules are.  I also like the "shoot the moon" mechanism that can possibly allow a player to catch up and win the game.

I was really hoping for more than I ended up getting out of this experience.  Optimal strategy seems to call for minimal bluffing.  The "limited vote" mechanic (you have a limited number of times you may vote "no" on a coronation per round, then are forced to vote yes) seems to have so much promise but didn't pan out to a fun game.

RATING: 7
This is a light and fun filler game that plays quickly.  I have two issues with the components.  First, the scoring track should have larger squares.  The scoring blocks completely cover the squares and there isn't space for a second marker in each spot.  Second, the stand-up figures are two dimensional and if you do not have a good angle to view the board, then you might not be able to see which character is at which level.  I would have used counters which laid on the board instead of the stand-up figures which can be hard to see and are easy to knock over when a level gets full.

As a self-respecting court plot demands, Viva il re! (King me!) has you deceive your way to the throne, stab the pretenders and install your followers into the throne and the highest positions: actually there’s no lasting strategy in this light game but trying to disguise your scheme and confuse the other players about your true intentions, in the attempt they’ll take the bait and do the dirty work in your place.

If played loudly and lightly, Viva il re! can be fairly chaotic and moderately fun.

Very light and repetitive.  I'm not fond of voting games.  This one is full of psychology and randomness.  Should you always begin the game by moving your royal heirs to the tops spots, or will that cause everyone to veto (kill) them??  Saving your veto power can be very useful... but can you count on another player to veto this would-be king ??
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A good simple filler game or party game deserves a place in everyone's game collection. That being said; You can skip this one. I find it bland and unfun.

This game is an exercise in push your luck, where you try to get as many of your noblemen pushed up in ranks all the way up to the throne. Voting decides whether someone will rightfully claim the throne or be 'overthrone'.

There's so little control that the outcome is purely based on group think. And because everyone has a secret goal, group think means chaos. You can try and push your men and women up as quickly as possible or you can try to hold them back hoping to let as much of your people survive. It doesn't matter. At least it's over pretty quick.

I think that this game should get more mention as a "gateway" game.  The mechanics are simple and the game is a lot of fun.  The 26 points for the last round seems a little too strong.  I've won a few games that way...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game is very simple but enjoyable.  There are three points in the game where choices must be made: in the setup phase, who to place and which level to place them; in the moving phase, who to advance; and when voting, how to vote.  The moves a player makes (or doesn't make) can be read and second-guessed, and therein lies the fun.  Like any game that is based entirely upon hidden knowledge and bluffing, you can put as much or as little strategy into the game as you want.

I will never play Tiki Topple again: King Me! does it better in every way. I'm not so crazy about the choice of font on the cards and stand-ups (and the stand-up pieces were a curious choice), but those are minor quibbles in a fantastic game of cutthroat strategy and planning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Bluffing at its best: the game plays very quickly and is good as a "main course" for beginners and non-gamers or as a quick filler for experienced players. Nice graphics, the box is way too big for its contents. I don't like the bathroom variant: it brings some unnecessary gimmicks to an already good game.

A silly game of trying to time when to move your people forward as opposed to people who you don't care about.

The trick is, often rounds end, not because everyone wants the character in question to ascend to the thrown, but because everyone is counting on the others to prevent it.

Based on 1 play:

I had a lot of fun with this the one time I played it, but it was really hard to get a feel from it off just one play. I really want to play this one again but when we're in the mood for something light and fluffy we tend to go for one we all remember the rules for.

This would probably be at least a 7 if I could play it more and really get a feel for it, but for now it's staying at a six just because it never grabbed everyone the way other light partyish games have.

This is a quick little game with simple rules. I like the bluffing bit of it. The components are very attractive. The thing that kind of leaves me cold is that each turn has no impact on other turns. It feels like there should be some ramifications for what you choose to do in later turns, to me. Its nice for a filler. I probably wouldn't request or go out of my way to play it, but I would not complain about playing it, either.

Fun casual game that's easy to learn. Little strategy to it, in that you try to save your "no" voting cards and hope that other players burn theirs, but if they're thinking the same as you, then chances are a new king will be crowned that's not on your list and didn't want crowned in the first place. 10 points for everyone but you and the other genius with the same strategy and all those "no" cards.

A nice light diversion. Limited strategy but as a light game its just fine in fact I think it's one of the better ones. There is a great deal of fun factor to it.

Components: Colorful, fun components. It is difficult to visually locate my candidate to the throne, despite the letter-coding.

Experience: Very simple, very light, but a fun way to pass twenty minutes. I enjoy the uncertainty when a character is promoted to the throne room, and I don't know if the player came to praise Caesar or bury him. (Despite my usual reluctance with other games, in this game I actually count all three unrelated rounds as one game, just as the rules command.)

Players are advancing members of the royal court up the ladder towards the throne.  Once a character reaches there, the players vote on whether to crown the character.  If a character is crowned, the round ends and points are scored for character advancement against each players "secret agenda".  The game is played over three rounds, with a misere twist for come-from-behind wins on the final round.  Light game, but very well done.  Fantastic presentation.

A Euro-version of 1313Dead End Drive. What it adds in elegence and graphics it loses in theme and fun factor. It is a simple filler which is good for non-gamers with a nasty streak!

Okay game - quick and painless, but rather chaotic.  One nit-picky gripe about the components: it's difficult to identify all of the charcter tokens when they're standing up bunched together on the board.  There is always at least one person around the table who can't see several of the characters.  Big wooden blocks with a letter initial on the top would've been better.

I like the play of the game, but what annoyed me was the board. I spent too much time trying to see which character was which. They figures get in the way and should have just been checker sized tokens that can be looked down on.

A solid filler for up to 6 players that's pretty light but very amusing.  The artwork is excellent and gives the game a lot of charm.  From a production standpoint, the scoretrack is far too small, and they certainly could've cut down on the box size some.  Three times now, we ended a round almost immediately because everyone wanted to hold on to their 'No' votes.

I had some problem with the mechanics of this game not working very well, but whatever my beef with it was, it has been lost in the sands of time. Something about the voting system making the game drag on and someone winning just because people go last after others have burned all their no vote cards. Whatever the reason, I didn't like it at all and I'm not going to play again to refresh my memory about why I didn't like it.

This is a light and fun game, but I'm just not that thrilled with it. The decisions are very simple, and although there's a small element of bluff, it is mostly irrelevant. Fortunately, it is a very quick game, otherwise I would like it even less. Perhaps it plays better with more.

I think it's a really wonderful, lightly strategic game, but the physical copy does not play as well as the online version.

It went over like a lead balloon.

A light-medium filler game for up to 6 people -- can play 3 rounds in 30 minutes (or less).  Often, you'll play a pretender to level-5, then promote him to king just to veto him (because he's not on your scoring card).  But if you run out of vetoes too early, you'll have problems... the last person with vetoes has a good chance of determining the final king.

It looks like a kids' game, and I guess it could be, but it's a perfectly serviceable filler for adults.  It's just what you've heard.  Players have cards that indicate their secret preferences for which characters they would like to succeed, and get points for getting those characters higher on the ladder.  It's pretty fluffy, but not in a bad way.

King Up! is a voting game which adds in a small heap of bluffing which can really turn things on their head.  The game is generally chaos no matter the player count, but seems to play better in the 4 or 5 player range.  As much as I enjoyed it, which I did for the most part, I felt as if there was something missing.  When we finished our first game, we were like, "Is that it?".  And even with further plays, yep, that's pretty much it.

RATING: 3
The board is a royal castle with different levels, each with a point value (0,1,2,3,4,5,10). There are a handful of nobles that get placed on levels 0-4 to start. Players take turns advancing nobles to a higher level, hoping to maximize the points they will get for the 6 nobles on their secret goal cards. The 10 point level is the throne. When promoted to that position, all of the players vote by playing voting cards face-down. One "no" vote means the noble is eliminated and nets zero points. Each player gets 2 "no" votes and have to discard them after being played - so eventually the no votes will run out. After a king is crowned, all nobles are scored for the level they are on. Repeat two more times.

We ended up in a 3-way tie. We looked up the tie-breaker, recalculated, and the winner was... a 3-way tie. Seemed like an appropriate conclusion for a game that felt almost entirely out of your control. A game this light needs to be more fun. Simple as that.

This is another game that I’m sure members of my gaming group would want to buy if they could play it.  It’s quick, easy, and a lot of fun to play.  Allowing players to “shoot the moon” (as they say in hearts) in the final round is a stroke of genius.   Plus the theme/core idea behind the game is executed (no pun intended) in a way that’s different than most games.  I do not feel it is fair to call this a game of deduction though.  There’s not enough conclusive evidence to truly deduce what characters are on each players scoring card.  It’s too inconclusive to make an assertions based on what characters your opponents move.  It’s more a game of bluffing than anything else.  Still, this game is a lot of fun and I’m always happy to play.

It's hard not to give a decent rating to most quick games that have anything going for them at all.  King Me! is very quick, but we may be playing it too quickly to fully enjoy it.  Perhaps with more table talk, we could make better guesses as to who wants what.  Right now, it can be pretty arbitrary, and we have a lot of greedy friends who want to save their "no" votes, so some rounds have ended quite abruptly.

I have since traded the game away.

It's a cute, quick and light election game of bluffing (and some keen deduction involved) that can accommadate up to six.

RATING: 7
 An intrigue court ranking and scoring system puts the players keeping an eye on their "own" guys. Soon enough, we realized that the game encourages people to have the "wrong" guy on the throne first to be voted off (read "beheaded") so that when people have fewer and fewer "No" vote on hands, the "right" guy could sit on the throne when everyone has to say a "Yes". At that time, the remaining people on the ranks are scored for your "men" and "women". The highest score won. Somewhat randomized, but fun and exciting at times.

I have the King up version.  I enjoy playing this game with the kids.  It is like Kremlin without the part of claiming people and doing actions.  You just move guys up to the top and then vote yes or no as King.  The key is you can vote yes an unlimited number of times, but you are limited in how many "no" votes you get.  Fun, takes about 15 minutes to play 3 rounds.

Extremely simple but fun game. Try to read your opponents minds and play your (limited) "NO" cards at the right moment. 

Many characters try to become king and are placed on the throne, by you or your opponents. If everyone agrees to have him as king, the game ends. But you only score points for certain characters, and everyone has a hidden list of other characters on which they score points. So make sure that your characters climb the ladder as high as possible.

Plays very fast. Best with 4+ players.

RATING: 5
Rating based on 3 players.

I really don't think this works with three, as each player has four no votes and there's no real need to work together. It becomes an exercise in luck in which characters are shared rather than of bluffing or strategy. I will say, though, that I still want to try this with 5 or 6 before I give up on it, because I do like the premise and I find the art charming.

The first round of this was awful because there didn't seem to be any point or strategy. I still don't think there's a point, but judging whether to make a run for the throne for yourself or to push someone else's candidate up there in hopes of knocking him or her off is fairly amusing.

RATING: 5
Random-feeling light filler about helping your favourites going up in the medieval social ladder. There is a little bit of tension in the voting process, but that's about it. While there is a small element of bluff, it's pretty much all random anyways -- if you're lucky enough to have the most favourites on your mission card in common with other players, you'll probably score the most points in this round. 

The rules covering scoring ensure a tight point total throughout the game, enhancing the random feeling.

RATING: 7
A simple bluff / double-think filler. Each player receive a card showing the 6 of 13 characters they support. Players move characters up to the top of the castle (7 floors), once one reaches the throne there's a vote and if that character is crowned scoring takes place.  If that character isn't crowned it's eliminated (executed) so you won't be able to score it.  Has appeal for gamers and non-gamers.

An excellent light game to keep the fun going once all your groups' brains have been burned out by the brain-burners.  The game consists of 13 markers that each have a name on them, and a board with six different levels on it.  Players are dealt a card that lists six of those people, and their goal is to get them into the highest ranks on the board as possible, including getting one of them elected king.  To be elected king a single marker is nominated, and then all the players must agree, unanimously, to make that person king.  Players can cast up to two "no" votes, however,  adding a fun psychological element to the game.  There's enough strategy to make the game fun, but not so much as to tax anyone's brain.  Very good for what it is, especially considering how quick it is.

Super simple game of moving characters up a path to ultimately vote on individual characters to see who becomes king. There's almost no game here, but it works well enough, I suppose. I tried this with the recent news of the Super Mario retheme, but I have to admit that I'm far less excited for it now. This is sort of like Demo-crazy without the quirky humor.

RATING: 6
There is a castle with 7 levels. Each player is dealt a card showing which 6 characters they support (out of the 13 possible characters in the game).  Players are also dealt one 'yes' card and two 'no' cards. Players take turns moving characters up or placing them (with certain restrictions) in the castle. Once a character reaches the top, a vote is held. If all players vote 'yes' a scoring round takes place; if any player votes 'no', that character is discarded and so are all the 'no' cards that were used. Play in 3 rounds. A bluffing double think game that reminds me of Muscat a bit. You'll enjoy this one if you like Adel Verplicht. But I'm not a real fan of these games.

Rated as a filler.  First game played in only about 15 minutes (5p). I wouldn't play with less than 5 and its probably best with 6.

Good bluffing/voting game. 3 rounds and thats it.  It is equally important to try and eliminate opponents high scoring people, but it really kinda backfired on me in the 3rd and final round. I very early nominated a king and everyone approved it, thinking that someone else would use their "no" card!

This is a light simultaneous action selection game with hidden goal cards.  Each player has a secret card that indicates which nobles will score.  The closer the nobles are to being king, the more they will score.  During each turn, a player elevates a noble one level.  However, to elevate a noble to king, players must simultaneously vote: one veto will cause the noble to be removed from the game, scoring nothing for anyone.  Players have a limited number of vetoes, so eventually someone will have to become king, at which point the game will end.  A lot of the strategy lies in knowing when to try to make a noble king, sometimes with the intent just to kill him off.  So really, it's an interesting guessing game, but it's really just that: a guessing game.

TRY Aug/04: played on youplay.it, but they only support single-round, which pretty much kills the game for me.  I think this could be a neat game with more rounds (as people hold onto their vetos).  Feels like Mamma Mia, in a way.

As is (everyone gets all their votes back each round), I cannot rate it higher.

A simple concept that relies on disguising one's intentions when selecting a potential king to promote, and then blind voting to either eliminate or elect a king (a democratic monarchy?!).

I don't like it, just a random rock, paper and shissors game. Just guess what's the choice of other opponents, with the only possible strategy of trying to understand if opponents are bluffing or not. The whole game is chaotic. There are much better bluffing games.
I give it a six because of the graphics and the easy rules... and because its an Italian game.
But I would have given it a 8 if only some other elements were added to it, making it not just only a continuous guess-the-bluff game.

There aren't many "voting games" commonly available and that's why Viva Il Re! is interesting. Any of my candidates have never been crowned but I still had fun trying.
It's interesting to see that at the later turns players tend to trust that their fellow mates will somebody play "No"-card. Thus leading to a shortened game. That can happen, it's all psychological!

Really short and silly filler. There is a lot of bluffing here, because you don't want to waste your vote cards, so you have to measure how likely your opponents are to vote against.

Now played the full range of players and suspect 5 is best as with 3 characters starting in the "0" cellar there's a stronger possibility of dramatically "shooting the moon" in the last round. One space moves keeps the game brisk; but the pace is cut short by the scoring which can take longer than the play. So in some ways King Me is and isn't an improvement on Undercover. Like it's predecessor, I''m finding that table talk is necessary to make this game a fun experience. As your intent is secret, there is no sitcom to tune into. There is the inherent "aaargh" factor when all players vote yes, while you hope someone will veto, resulting in you not scoring much. One important thing to mention is that 3 of your characters will be on each other card in play; part of the interest is determining which player has which 3 so as to find alliances. The "4 to a floor" rule allows for some tactical play.As mentioned elsewhere, players crane necks to determine the identity of the 2 dimensional characters (cheap production decision or intentional design to watch the above behaviour to divine vested interest); so best played sitting opposite each other.

Well, on the positive side, it was fairly inexpensive, and plays quickly.

And I'm glad it does, because what "game" there is consists mostly of moving low quality components on a low quality board, and then figuring out if your opponents want that character to be king.  There's a vote, some quick arithmetic, and then...let's do it two more times!  

Alright, I'm being a little dramatic, but I was kind of unimpressed by this game.  When it isn't being mercilessly cutthroat, it is boring.  It FEELS old...like, the mechanics feel like they're from Hasbro in the late 80's.  It is clunky and the components really are crap.

King Me! is a simple chaotic game.  I initially purchased it because the description reminded me of Kremlin.  And there are some similarities.

King Me! is played over three rounds.  The player with the most points at that time wins, hurray!  The board represents a castle of seven levels.  The levels are numbered 0-5 with the highest level, the throne, numbered with a 10.  There are 15 characters and at the beginning of a round the players take turns placing them on levels 0-4. Also players will secretly have a list of five characters that will provide points for them at the end of the game.  A character is worth the number of points equal to the value of the castle level it is at when the round ends.

Once the characters have been placed the game commences.  On a turn a player simply moves a character up to the next higher level of the castle.  Only four characters are allowed per level so there are some blocking opprotunities.  If a character is moved on to the throne then all the players must vote on whether they want that character to be king (and worth 10 points).  If there are any "no" votes the presumptuous character is cast out of the castle and will be worth no points.  Herein lies the best part about the game.  Players can vote "yes" as many times as they want.  But can only vote "no" a finite number of times.  Ideally you don't want to have to vote "no" if you know someone else will.  So the trick is to try and predict, based on the characters they seem to favor, who the other players are backing.

The big problem with the game is there's not enough room in the opening to get a read on who's backing who.  As a result it can seem pretty chaotic.  In fact I've seen players win the game by playing randomly and not even looking at their list of favored characters.  Not a good sign for a strategy game, but King Me! isn't a strategy game.  A lesser problem is trying to keep track of five out of fifteen constantly changing characters.  A round may not last more than five minutes and then you'll get a new list of five.  It's not uncommon for me to think I'm still backing a character from the last round.

All that aside, King Me! is a pretty fun game.  It's almost a party game in simplicity and quickness of play while still having a little bit of a kick.

Prodotto (italiano) dalla dV GIOCHI! Il Re, ormai stufo di regnare, mette in palio la corona. Chi sarà il suo degno successore? Paladini, cuochi, pittori e tutti gli altri pretendenti si affannano per conquistare il trono, in un vorticoso giro di sotterfugi. Si giocano carte con astuzia per portare in alto i favoriti... ma solo uno degli strampalati sudditi sarà il nuovo Re! Si tratta di un gioco dalla meccanica piuttosto semplice, e quindi adatta a qualsiasi tipo di giocatore, ma il gioco ha una sua profondità strategica che si sviluppa essenzialmente nella fase di movimento. La scelta di chi mandare “in alto” può sia rivelare le vostre intenzioni agli altri, ma può anche fungere da specchietto per le allodole. Divertimento garantito con tante risate... Hahaha.

Kremlin lite is fun when played quickly. A nice and easy to play no brainer for 20 minutes. I actually don't mind it because you've not invested too much time in what turns out to be a groan worth opener or closer for the evening. For goodness sake though, play it quickly because it doesn't deserve to be played any other way.

I found this to be an interesting game of bluff and second-guessing.  Because of that, it can be played fairly seriously or fairly lightly.  When played lightly, it is a very fluffy light game.  When played seriously, the analysis can be quite intense.  Unfortunately, the game breaks down when you have a mixture of people playing lightly and seriously, at least for those playing seriously.  After all, you can't really tell the folks playing lightly the need to pay more attention when playing lightly is a legitimate way to play the game.  Of course, that is a problem that a lot of games like this can bump into. [01-01-2010]

RATING: 6.5
A few years ago, I played [thing=34373][/thing] and liked how it distilled the concept of hidden control of characters into a filler game, but the game also threw pretty much any player control out of the window. Happily, King Me! retains the same concept but allows players to have more control over the movement of characters as well as (ironically) vote on whether characters get to become king. There's still a lot of luck involved, but there is a bit of depth to how players choose to vote and sneak unlikely candidates up the social ladder.

The setting is also a bonus point, as it allows fantastical stories to be woven about how the scullery maid would eventually become king. The illustrations are appropriately storybook-like, but putting the characters' names on one side of the standee is a questionable design choice. I would have preferred flat chunky tokens to represent characters, but you can't win everything.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Hidden Info, Voting. Fun filler! Everyone is secretly backing several characters and trying to get them promoted by moving into higher and higher scoring tiers, but once someone makes it to the King space, a secret vote is taken to determine success or death. Players have a limited pool of NO votes, so the jockeying to conserve votes while axing opposing characters is a lot of fun. Could be a good gateway game.

Aranyos királycsináló játék. 13 udvaronc vetélkedik a királyi címért, akiket a játékosok juttathatnak fel a trónig, aholis mindenki szavaz, akarja-e a jelöltet a trónra. A nem szavazatok végesek, így idővel biztosan lesz új király. Minden játékosnak a célkártyáján hat trónkövetelő neve van feltüntve, az új király megválasztásakor a kártyán szereplő udvaroncok ranglétrán éppen elfoglalt helyük szerint pontozódnak. Érdekes, jó kis partyjáték, ahol talán túl egyértelmű a stratégia, de nem is kell túl nagy mélységet keresni ilyen játékban.

There is certainly some psychological aspects to this game, as you try to figure out who is promoting people to the king and why, but overall, it lasts a touch too long and feels too random with really limited options on what you can do on your turn.  Unlike other games, it doesn't really shine with this simplicity, but just ends up being unremarkable.

This is a simple, fun family game. A little strategy, but can be played without needing to think too much. I enjoyed it. It is nothing amazing, but I will play it every now and then for a break from the more involved games.

RATING: 6
2 plays.

I'd played this once before, many years ago. I remember not really liking it very much. But TedC was very enthusiastic about it so I gave it another try. There were 7 of us (me, TedC, BobA, SarahR, EarlB, MichelleC, BrianE), so Ted used a few coins as the voting cards - the game supported 7 just fine (says it's for up to 6).

Simple game: Each player gets a card with 6 letters on it, corresponding to several tokens labeled A-P (I think) - these are the 6 people you care about. Then, take turns placing these tokens in ranks worth 1, 2, 3, or 4 points. On your turn, you can advance a marker up 1 step (from 4->5->10). A max of 4 people per rank, and 1 at rank 10. If someone gets to 10, there's a vote: players have 2 NO votes and 1 YES. Votes are revealed simultaneously: any NOs --> token dies, and is removed from game. All NO votes are discarded (so each player may only veto 2 people each round). Keep playing till someone gets all YES votes (voted king), then tally points for the 6 people on your card, based on their current rank. After each round, retrieve your vote cards, deal out a new set of cards to people, and repeat the whole thing; then again (3 rounds). Highest points wins!

This was better the second time around! It's kind of an interesting bluffing/deduction game - who supports which character? Advance one of my people, or someone elses? Count of SOMEONE killing off the candidate, or use one of my precious 2 NO votes to make sure this one is not king? 

The game is a little light for me, but still not too bad.

[daVinci Games 'King Me!' edition] {Kingdoms, party; secret-goal, voting; optimal 5-6p} King me! is a decent party game. It is full of player interaction and fun. It is also very fast paced. Player have handful of decisions in getting high score. The secret goal is the cornerstone of King me! It provides double-guessing and intrigues between players.  It's a god party game but the repetitive turns bugged me. 

The theme is strong. Everything is nicely made. The illustration is very stylish but it is not very color-blinded friendly.

Fun little game! The only problem with it that I have (and this is a MAJOR nitpick) is the theme. It would have made more sense to me for this game to be called Corporate Ladder, with a retiring CEO, and the board of directors choosing his successor, since kings generally don't retire by choice, and their successors are not chosen, they are born. Like I said, this is incredibly minor, and does not affect the gameplay in the least. Great choice for beginning gamers, or for when time is limited, like at lunchtime. Would also be a good opener/closer for an evening of gaming. Recommended.

This is a decent filler game, as it plays quickly, and there are meaningful decisions to be made.  It doesn't quite reach the level of my favorite fillers though.  It's tough to be very clever with the bluffing aspect of the game, and it feels that it is almost random when everyone eventually all votes yes to end a round.  I do have a nagging feeling that there is more to this game than I am implying, however, so I would gladly play some more.

Great fun for families/slash kids.  

Works well with 4-6 players.

I have not yet played it with adults only, but suspect that there might be some fun strategies and bluffing that might develop.

Update:  Have played with adults.  Yes, they do strategize more, but I think you'd have to play this a lot more with the same group to really get into all the double-think.  There are so many characters on your card and so many on the board that people tend to play fast and loose instead of strategizing. 

I am not advocating deep analyses and the accompanying longer play times. It is just an observation about why this may never be as meta as I thought it might be. 

I still like it and the rating holds.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 3

The board is a "ladder" (castle) with the cellar up to the throne on top. The higher the room, the more points it gives. Each player gets a goal card with names on it. These guys he needs to get to the more point rooms.
Now at the start, the players in turns can place one guy each on the board (except for the two top-most rooms). The only other rule is that there mustn't be more than four people in one room.
After the placing, on your turn you can always draw one person up one step (never down). That goes on until someone reaches the top. Then a voting session comes up. Each player has a certain number of "no" cards in his hands and one "yes" card.
Only when all players play yes, the round ends and the guy becomes king. If there is a no, the no card is discarded and the guy to vote on gets discarded and is out for the round. 
If the king is chosen, every player gets points according to his hidden goal card and where these people on the card are placed. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins the game.
This is a very very fun little game. 
it has a cool gambling aspect cause you never know if you should use your veto or someone else does.
You don't really have a lot of control but that is somehow exactly what it has to be.

On the one hand, this is a neat game of thinking, out-thinking, and outwitting; on the other hand, I can see this getting very repetitious, especially with 3 rounds each turn.  This is a nicely produced game, though, that interests me.  If you like the sort of psychological challenges that these sort of games require, you might enjoy it.  My biggest issue with the game is that it's a filler idea in a medium-heavy timeslot.  There are other games I would rather play in that time.

Cute, quick filler with neat voting dynamics, push your luck and pseudo bluffing elements. Only real downside is there are sooo many characters, and the color scheme/font are hard to distinguish, so you need to constantly adjust the markers or get a closer look to evaluate what's going on -- and scoring at the end of each round is far, far too tedious. Still, novel enough to stand on its own and provide a different experience than other fillers of the same length.

My first impression was that this is a really lite version of Kremlin, in that you are trying to get a selective number of people to as high of a position you can without them being voted out by the other players.  The mechanic of moving these characters was completed dumbed down though.  Sure you can try to bluff by moving those not on your card, but more often than not nobody really pay attention to it to actually make it work to your advantage, besides getting a piece to the top level so you (or someone else) can remove it from the game.  A fairly dull experience overall.

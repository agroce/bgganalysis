Tried it once on vacation with friends, was fun, but since I rarely drink....  I still wonder why I backed this, knowing I don't drink beer...

This is my favorite nerdy drinking game. Just enough "take that" cards to keep you on your toes and very easy to help people take just a few more drinks even though they are going to win.

RATING: 8
Plays like Munchkin with a few different tweaks to the game with the added bonus of drinking added to defeat monsters, makes for a fun party game. Best part being is even if you do not win the game, the real win is seeing how much you can get your friends drunk throughout the game.

It's like Munchkin but you have to take drinks to defeat enemies and you have the option to NOT fight the monster. It's really stupid fun.

This does a great job at balancing with the drinking aspect. The first game we played, I drank to get power ups every turn.. but when we played after that, I chose not to. I won handily the first game. Not the second..

If you play this game WITHOUT beer or alcohol, you are doing it wrong.

With beer, this game acts as a nice catalyst for drunken shenanigans. My friends and I have never completely finished a game, since we end up stalemating at a certain level. Awesome artwork. Card stock is relatively low quality (which is a shame since there will always be a beverage at the table).

House rules make it a lot more interesting.

The game play itself is rather boring, if it wasn't a drinking game it would be frustrating and rank much lower.  But it is a pretty fun drinking game.  This game works better with smaller groups.  More than 8 people and it just isn't as fun.

This game will get you wrecked if you only have 4 players. The game seems to get easier with more players. Its like exactly how I used to play "drunken Munchkin"

It's tough to rate this one, because no one has ever survived a full game.  Think... munchkin... but with drinks instead of hitpoints.  The drink totals skyrocket quickly, so bring your liver's A game.  Other than that.. it looks neat and the cars are high quality.

RATING: 9
Very fun with the right people. It definitely could get repetitive, but we never made it far enough for that to really matter. The only real criticism I have is that (unless you're sipping beer ... and maybe even then, depending) you're going to get destroyed if you have anyone that has it out for you, assuming you are taking all your drinks. I've had drink stacks upwards of 30+ if I remember correctly (it's been a while).

Still, fun game. And maybe that ridiculousness is the point.

We had a great time. The game surprisingly had a good amount of strategy to it, if you were trying to get to level 6 without having to drink too much. If you are willing to drink whatever it takes to get to level 6, GOOD LUCK!

I really love the artwork on this game.  Wonderful!  It's clearly a drinking game, so don't expect any in-depth strategy.  Although there's only one winner, I find everyone wins (or loses) when the game is over.  Cheers!

KS'ed.  Highly awaiting my first video session of this beast. 

A much better party game than you would think.  Many people will poo poo it just due to the alcohol involved. 

But game has high interaction, high inclusion, easy- flexible rules and a high fun factor.  An oddly pleasant KS surprise. 

Cards get doused with alcohol and beer. 

Dropping due to quality of cards =/

I took this game out to a bunch of non-nerd, non-gamers at a party.

20 minutes later, they were wearing beer boxes as helmets and claiming drinks for their king.

Fun but very dependent on group, threshold for drinking, and the ability to teach them the game sober. Gets ugly but that's the fun. The play  are most memorable end in disaster and we definitely never have a winner, usually just a last man standing.

By choosing to play Drunk Quest we enjoyed a lively start to an evening but the game ended on a sour note of argument and confusion. You should prepare yourself to argue about the rules - which have no official F.A.Q. as of May 2014.

Binge drinking thinly disguised as a n RPG. Its definitely fun for getting hammered but the gameplay is hardly groundbreaking.

(Print and Play edition, custom printed, 100 lbs. card stock, laminated.  Cost: $114.00)

I wanted to like it...really, I did.  I love board games, and I enjoy a bit of binge drinking from time to time, but Drunk Quest has problems:
- First...drinking games are inherently kind of "screw your friends", but Drunk Quest?  That's pretty much all you do.  One person pulls a monster and everyone tries to make it tougher.  And by "tougher," I mean you just pile drinks onto it.  
- The point of get togethers is to drink and interact.  The point of Drunk Quest is to avoid drinking and seemingly keep the interaction down to playing one card to hurt your friend, or a random action that may or may not impact what is going on in the game at that moment.  
- The rules aren't complicated for gamers, but there are some design and rule choices that make it unnecessarily (and impractically) fussy for a drinking game.  Basically, I'd say this: imagine trying to explain to your non-gamer girlfriend how interrupts work in Magic the Gathering.  Yeah.  Not easy to teach.
- Can be endless.  With (many) level up and level down instants, you're far more likely to win in the middle of someone else's turn than by actually "defeating" a monster...which is the point of the game.  

+  On the plus side, the art is cool, and it is nice to see some one out there trying to blend the gaming and drinking worlds...


Unfortunately, the only thing this game really did was make me want to make up my own drinking game.

Honestly, I think this game deserves a higher rating but I'm going by BGG's system.

It's a bit like a version of Munchkin where the biggest issues are resolved by drinking - If people try to screw you over to stop you from winning, the worst they can do is make you drink more, which is rather the point; You can hence choose to wait till later or just get ridiculously drunk.

But...I don't really drink any more, and certainly not to the extent that this game encourages, so I've passed it on and have no intention of playing again.

For my taste, its just about perfect war game. Not too light, not too heavy.

RATING: 6
An absolutely essential re-mastering of Fantasy Flight's edition. WWII theme makes this game a yawn-fest for me (literally) but the gameplay itself is tight and this box is gigantic. With two huge armies, a bucket of dice, endless bags of chits, and the largest most amazing and thick modular playing boards that I've ever seen, Tide of Iron Next Wave was a must buy for me. It very much plays like old hex-and-chit wargames but instead with high quality minis and chits. Creating your own scenarios is practically a necessity since the game book's are completely unbalanced and garbage. Also you might want to house-rule some tank stats as every army's tanks are practically identical. There's nearly no customization with those units. However, every other single facet of this game is nearly perfect. Especially the customizable modular and specialized ground force units.

RATING: 5.5
Such beautiful components, even though I normally think miniatures are super tacky, but I don't really like being able to do everything I want to do in a game each turn. It feels... not very gamey.

Only 1 big scenario played so far, but I loved it.  The match had a great ebb and flow to it.  The dice rolls can be frustrating, but they always seem to even out in the end.  I felt like a legitimate field general directing my troops across a large front and making tough decisions in most cases.  I found myself thinking about things I could have done differently after the game several days and weeks later.  Very tactical and strategic.  I can't wait to get another game in.

A solid wargame sporting lots of plastic bits on top of relatively easy to understand ruleset.

RATING: 7.5
A lovely tactical WWII game.  Not too rules heavy but still more meat than Memoir '44.  The production is awesome (typical FFG) and the amount of scenarios and expansions now available are giving this game plenty of options.  A great game that I would play any time.

Includes: Designer Series Vol. 1 book

Fun game - more fiddly than the faster playing Memoir but it provides the tactical choices of the heavier wargames. Unlike Memoir, the alternating action sequence ensures all units get a chance to move in each round but present the challenge of which unit should go when. Scenarios also have round limits to ensure the attacker doesn't dilly dally.

The game is awesome! Although I have never played in any scenario excpet the first trial-scenarios :D Oh I dream about the opportunity to play the big battle scenario, but the game is quite complicated, so many rules, so many options... There is a lot to memorize, I hope that one day I will remember all these things and will be aple to play at once, because setup (at least of some scenarios) doesn't last too long. Excellent game for people interested in WWII or in strategy games.

I really like this game. You can quickly get into a game, but take more rules into play when comfortable with more complex gameplay. Especially like the kick starter extra rules, like vehicle facing!

An excellentt WWII wargame. The components are great, is not a hard strategic war game, but is deep and mutch more complete than Memoir'44. The preparation may take a while but worth the wait.

Includes:

- Designer Series Vol 1: A good add, with excellent historic scenarios made by famous wargame designers.

Same comments as the first edition except that the second edition (Next Wave) is better because the rules are more complete than the earlier edition rules.

Great tactical wargame with medium complexity. The rulebooks are a significant improvement over the original rulebook. This game also includes more scenarios and vehicles than the original game.

RATING: 9
Loving the added complexity of this compared to Memoir '44. I feel much more involved with each scenario! I think it is because every squad can be ordered every game round and there is no hoping you can accumulate the right order cards to do what you want to do.

A TOTAL LACK OF REALISM Tanks are not the right scale/size the combat between them is a joke they have individual tanks combining fire? and I don't think the fire or armour values are at all realistic American tank destroyer  nearly as good.as tiger tank ridiculous...lots of dice approach so massive LUCK factor very little difference between infantry on both sides would not want to play this again SOLD!

We own almost anything of FFG's version of the game.

The main reason we bought this is the fact that the miniatures are said to be a lot less "loosening up" when attached to their bases.

We do however still need to play this version and then we will put our "findings" on the Geek.

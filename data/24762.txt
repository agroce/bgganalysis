One of my favorate auction games is Medici. It is to no surprise that Medici vs Strozzi hit the spot with 2 players for me.  Never though that it could be done an aution game for two?  but Knizia made it.  This is my favorate 2 player auction game.  If you like Medici, this game is the 2 player version.  Very cool game.

RATING: 8
Quite interesting, mathy.  At first prices seem a little obvious -- how many points?  But "having the bag" is important, and ship space control is important.  And how much time is left matters for monopoly, so the math is "unsolvable."

Don't get people who dislike this because, yes, good play means you both lose money.  It's not even totally unrealistic, if you think of certain abstractions (for a while you might both be willing to lose money if you can end up the only player left in the game -- many a business doesn't make money for a few years!)

RATING: 6
This is not a light, fluffy, two player game. This is a game where careful analysis counts for 90% of the game and the luck of the draw counts for the rest. Controlling the tile draw muddles the value calculations somewhat -- and that is the way it should be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A terrific distillation of Medici for two players.  I draw 1-3 goods tiles and then set a price on them; either you pay that price and take the tiles or I do.  As with Medici, there are bonuses and scoring for the biggest ship to be considered.  Added to that, each round ends when one player fills their ships, so there are times when you have to think about paying over the odds just to prolong the round. 

This is a really intense head to head contest with plenty of agonising decisions.  An excellent gamers' game in a small package.

Wow, there's a LOT to think about in this game. Very different to plain ol' Medici; even harder to valuate lots. Throwing stuff in the harbor just to spite your opponent is fun, but frustrating from the other side. I'm going to have to play this one a few more times to truly get the hang of it.

RATING: 7
From a marketing perspective, auction games need some other element to distract/lure/entertain players as they learn how to value the auction (which often takes several plays). Until players learn to value the auction, their decisions feel arbitrary and the game may fall flat. Thus, when you look at popular auction games on BGG, they either have some other mechanic or a large player count (which creates a certain player dynamic that is fun/entertaining). And many people simply assume 2-player auction games don't work very well.

But they do... and Medici vs Strozzi may be one of the best auction games out there. Part of the reason is how dramatically the valuation of tiles can change; they change base on the fact that (1) the harbors have 2 scoring criteria, (2) the harbors have a memory, (3) the spatial elements the that ships create, and (4) the probabilistic decisions based on the finite distribution of the tiles. The other part is every action matter. In many auction games, players can sit back and pick and choose their battles. In this game you may need to purchase tiles that you can't place on your boat simply because it would be too advantageous for your opponent. And you may need to purchase overpriced tiles to stop your opponent from rushing the end of the round. 

Even among auction fans, I can't say this game is for everyone. Many players enjoy the player dynamics, which you find with a higher player count, and/or a combination of mechanics. But for those that enjoy the mental gymnastics involved in valuing deterministic and probabilistic information... this game is very very good.

Component wise... everything is dated and the blue/green colors are too similar. But mechanically, the design impresses it.

Does every freakin' game with the word "Medici" in it have to have terrible graphic designs? I'm not even color blind and I have a hard time telling the pastel blue column from the pastel green. Other than that minor complaint, I have to say this is a great 2er bidding game that captures the feeling of the original. Recommended for auction lovers.

A working auction mechanic for 2 players! That's awesome!
Although the theme is the usual Knizia paste-up, the game is very clever and one of my favorite 2-player games. It's very mathy, and apparently banal... but it carries in itself the antidote for its "formulaic banality" and mathyness, as probability management.

Medici vs Strozzi is a solid 2-player auction game.  The tile flip adds a healthy dose of randomness.  However, the downside is that the order in which the tiles flip can potentially swing the game in favor of the Medici... or Strozzi player.

As much as I like Medici, I actually like the rules of this two-player varient better. The money is more fiddly but necessary with no scoring track. On my sixth play, I finally ended the game with more money than I started with, both players did.

RATING: 6
In my opinion, better than the new 2-player variant included in Medici (2016 edition). Moving monopoly markers adds a second layer of considerations when evaluating a group of tiles. The zero valued tiles are very nice as well compared to the original Medici. They move the token two spaces on the monopoly track, but don't contribute for the most valuable ship bonus. Hmm... Good game.

Another Kosmos 2 player by the good doctor (how many does he have :)). This game pulls off a very difficult mechanism very well, the 2 player auction. 1 player names a price for various goods, and the other player either pays and takes them, or makes the 1st player pay the bank to take them. Unfortunately, in the games I have played, my opponent seemed to either wildly under or over value the tiles and the game wasn't very close at all. I need to try this one with a real gamer and see how I do.

Lots of decisions to make, and lots of bluffing in this one.  We quickly chose poor bidding increments and both went into big debt.  Doesn't matter though, it's the delta between your score (or debt) that counts.

A brutally unforgiving game.  You pull tiles, then offer a price.  The other player can pay that price, but if she doesn't, you must.  Imagine if a tile set is worth little to me but a lot to her.  If I bid too low, she'll say "OK!" and clean up.  If I bid too high, she'll say no and I'm going to suffer.  I find it very difficult to make this decision.

I do think it's a well-done game and gamers who don't mind such a challenge may enjoy it.

Finally, a game from Knizia where I perceive the typical complaints his detractors level at his games.  Usually I scoff at the vague claims that his games are soulless, inert or derivative, assuring myself that if this were actually true I would not enjoy his latest offering so very much.  Such is not the case with Medici vs. Strozzi, a game I had doubts about considering my ambivalence towards Medici and its two-player auction character.

The most glaring vicissitude is that it is not, in anyway, fun.  I glory in well-executed strategy, I can engage in mirth in some less serious game, or I boisterously decry some vicious but well-played move on the part of my opponent, but Medici vs. Strozzi doesn't provide on any of these levels.  Much like Medici, this game relies far too heavily on calculation, rather simple, but all too tedious, calculation.  Part of the appeal of so many of Knizia's auction games is how he weaves intuitive elements into the evaluation process, yet MvS rarely exhibits such a quality.  Therefore, it turns out to be dry, immensely boring and repetitious, much like its older sibling.  The common situation at the end of the game with players sitting on less money than they started with only exacerbates the notion that perhaps time could have been better spent elsewhere.

I do give it credit for alleviating some of the more annoying problems of Medici, though most of the responsibility for this rests in limiting the game to two players.  Medici has an unfortunate "policing" problem where it often required players to bid high just to forbid another player from winning a lot too cheaply, except a bid too high or a vindictive player could make you suffer for such a stunt.  Yes, I realize other games are also burdened with the same flaw, even other Knizia auction games, but I think the calculation endemic of Medici accentuates it.  MvS, because it is only two players, obviates this problem, with the side-effect of removing the little tension inherent in the original Medici design.

Early days - my rating might change. Like this one a lot - but I like Medici so it's not surprising. As it's a 2-player it's very min/max, doing something to hurt your opponent is just as good as doing something to help you. Bidding mechanic means you can often end the game with less money than you started, especially as you can calculate how much a particular tile (or group) is worth. This would be bad except the tile draws are blind, so the actual worth of a tile can vary depending what others appear. Only downside is the colours, I find it hard to distinguish between some of the commodities.

Cute two player game.  It has some flaws though.  It gets really unbalanced when one player is desperate to fill their ships.  You get outrageous bids at the end of each day.  And on the tail-end of the final day one person has the advantage of being able to total everything before bidding.

Ok, not as bad as Fiji, but otherwise this is the worst Euro I've played.  Made us wonder if we were playing a game, or doing work - math problems would be more fun.  Along with T&E (which I like, but certainly not to the extent of its reputation), makes me wonder if Knizia is just totally overrated, or if I'm just a hater.  Either way, seems doubtful his games will make it to our table too often.

Excellent scoring system ruined by a game economy that is way too open and undefined. "How much do you bid?" "Um... I don't know." The auctions drive the entire game, and I really don't want to have to play this a dozen more times before I get a feel for how much things are/should be worth. 

The auction-heavy nature of the game clearly shows its age, and as such, I am happy to let it fall into the dustbin of history. Cool theme, though.

The beginning and midgame are interesting as the players evaluate the bundles in terms of their long term and short term value, both to themselves and the other player.

However, the end game, being highly calculable is a bit long and dull due to all the calculations, and potential game ending packets are interminable as everything is calculated to determine the highest price point at which you win, and then the opponent mist purchase the packet and do the same calculations on their turn, back and forth, back and forth, until the game, mercifully, ends.

I also realize I am not a big fan of tug of war battles. It feels like I'm not going anywhere, and that all my work is too easily undone. This is often the case with area majority games where you can remove another player's cubes.

Don't let the arithmetic intimidate you, there is far more going on here than optimization.  In fact, approaching this as an optimization problem will get your head handed to you.  Tricky estimations, anticipating your opponents options, and judging the pace of play make for an ultimately mind-bending and intense gaming experience in a short amount of time.  If you are taking longer than the 30 min suggested time on the box, you are approaching this wrongly and your results will show.

After one playing, I have to admit this is a well-designed game. My problem was that it was too computational for my enjoyment. Perhaps it was not the best time for me to try it, at the end of a gaming session, but the game seems to take on a much harder edge in a 2-player struggle that the multiplayer game lacks.

This is good and bad. The good is that it becomes very tight and hard-fought. The bad is that a mis-play is compounded since it not only hurts you....it helps your opponent. I found myself not wanting to figure too exactly how much a lot would impact the score. I think played a different time with a different opponent my opinion may improve. 

I can certainly see why this game would appeal greatly to some players, maybe even me at a different time.

More than "fun," less than "excellent."

Initially Medici vs. Strozzi was a game I never paid much attention to, probably because of the dull Renaissance setting. A long time ago there was talk of since defunct publisher QWG issuing a Dutch edition, and if that had come to pass perhaps I might have played it earlier than I eventually did. I encountered the game on a friend's table, and realised there and then that I Needed To Have This Game.

MvS is an exceedingly devious (and functional!) auction game for two players, which in itself is highly unusual. If you like auctions, this game really ought to be in your collection. It works because of a few simple yet effective tricks. One is that you don't need to make more money than you started out with; just ending up with more money than your opponent is good enough. Even if you end up in the red: no problem. It's weird to play a game like so, but it works! The second trick is in creating asymmetry through monopoly positions. And the final, most ingenious trick of all: mingling deterministic with probabilistic valuations. You can calculate the value of an offer... if you ignore future possibilities which are just as important to take into account. How valuable is denying your opponent an extra action? Or losing the opportunity to draw 3 tiles? Which tiles remain in the bag and what can you (or your opponent) expect to draw still? You really have no idea how surprisingly difficult the valuation becomes if all of the above comes together.

There is, for the moment, a slight doubt as to the game's long-term longevity because once you both hit upon a good valuation, it becomes a matter of luck of the draw. That's not to say that hitting upon this 'formula' is easy (because it isn't), but I do suspect that you put your mind to it the game [i]will[/i] be done at some point. But you'll have had quite a pleasant journey up to that point. Even though I really don't play this game often enough, I've upgraded the rate by 1 point because of its highly unusual qualities.

Battle Line or Schotten Totten for gamers. Knizia is a Master.


[COLOR=#990000]**[Español** Éste juego es como un Schotten Totten para Gamers. Se juega más lento que este y también es más duro. Las decisiones pueden ser muy difíciles. Otro juego que debería ser todo un clásico moderno al igual que el Schotten Totten.

Cuando alguien pida un crédito, es mejor hacer que el otro jugador coja la misma cantidad de dinero para evitar un posible olvido de devolverlo.

Si te gusta este juego también es conveniente que le eches un ojo a los siguientes: Schotten Totten, Battle Line, Lost Cities, Medici, Marco Polo Expedition y la serie de 10 days.

Le subo la nota a 10 por que Knizia merece tener un juego de subastas rateado con 10.[/COLOR]

Production: Attractive art; sturdy tiles; functional coins of sizes reflecting their values; a nice cloth bag large enough to root one's hand around in.  Play: At first, I thought it was a fascinating game.  Having different commodities at different ports, and different sizes of ships to dock made for lots of interesting decisions about where best to invest one's money, especially with regard to quality of goods.  The central bidding mechanism at times just boils down to a zero-sum game of cost, but one player, with ships almost full, can threaten to end a round, and thus possibly extort large sums of money from the other player who wants to continue.  Players might also buys commodities they don't want, and which they don't care if their opponent gets, just to take control of the initiative.  My first playing resulted in a 347-point spread, with neither of us having regained our money from the beginning of the game; but unlike in Medici, where the player who stays out of the over-priced bidding is rewarded with free goods, in this game abstaining will just leave one with empty docks, and thus no resistance to the opponent's investment in commodities.  My second playing just wasn't all that interesting.  The market was extremely volatile; I had no idea what anything was worth most of the time, and when I could actually calculate its exact worth for both my opponent and I, we tended to set the bidding just below that price. (2 0 2) (2 plays)

Haven't played too much (2 times as of this comment) but I'm happy with both plays. I think it is a bit heavier than Medici, as each decision weighs more than in Medici (you can let a lot go and not worry too much). In Medici vs Strozzi, each lot is critical.

I know I'm going to enjoy more games for sure!

This tiny two-player game packs a serious punch.

While seemingly very similar to the 3+ player Medici, this one requires a significantly different approach. It's very (very) tricky to value both the immediate worth of tile lots as well as future implications of buying (or refusing) a particular lot.

Very interesting.

Players represent Italian families trying to corner the market in commodity trade.  A 2 player variation of the old Knizia auction game, which I like and still play a lot.  Players still flip up goods for auction in lots of 1-3, and if bought have to load them on ship.  However, now there are three ships, and three harbours (which associated commodity tracks).  Ships line up against harbours, which can change each round.  Nicely thought out, plays in about 20 grueling minutes.  Excellent adaptation of the older game.

RATING: 3
The bottom line for me on this one is that I find the bidding system profoundly unfun.  I was really looking forward to this game, but after a few plays, found it to be incredibly mathy.  Well, duh, it's a Knizia, but this is mathy squared.  For every lot you need to figure out how much it is worth to you, and then how much it is worth to your opponent.  Then you have to price it hoping that your opponent makes a mistake in THEIR calculations.  Ugh.  Plus, it always seems to work out that even the winner has lost a lot (if not most) of their money by the end of the game.  Ending up at a profit seems very unlikely if you're playing properly.  So this is a trading game where you strive to lose less money than your opponent.  That's not terribly thematic.  Medici and Strozzi must really have hated each other if they were willing to trade themselves into a hole out of spite.  I want to think I'm missing something here, but if I knew what that was then I wouldn't be missing it.  I generally love Knizia (he's my favorite designer), but occassionally the elegance of the design fails to generate the spark that makes the game fun.  This is one of those rare cases (Quo Vadis was the other for me).  If this game had a less granular bidding system, perhaps like the one in Ra or High Society, I may have liked it much more.

I think it's a good idea, but it just doesn't grab me.
The idea of the number on the merchandise tiles is good for one thing, and the number of tiles you have is good for another works really well.

However, the unlimited money does not.

It is all about calculating if this buy will pay of or not (including what it's worth for your opponent), and I don't find it any fun. I was going to rate this 5, but writing this, I'm taking it down to for.

The game is very Knizia, so if you are a fan, it will probably work for you. (I am not a fan.)

RATING: 7
Simple design with some fairly unremarkable looking pieces and mechanics, but what really sells this game is the purity of how goods are priced. There is no back-and-forth auction to get the exact value of a good, but rather players setting values based on their gut feeling, which can cause weird a flux in commodity evaluation that is just a cool effect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I want to give this another go, but my first impression is strongly negative due to the "mathiness" others have mentioned.  If you want to play optimally, it seems you should never offer more than one tile up for auction because it can only hurt you since your opponent has all the decision power in deciding whether to accept your price or not (regular Medici avoids this).  If one player achieves a lead early on, it's nearly impossible to catch up because you can calculate how much tiles are worth.  If optimal play occurs (one tile auctioned at a time) then you're left with a situation of tedious number crunching that just isn't very fun.

Really cool game. Emphasis is far more on set collection versus the auction element. I've yet to find a really strong traditional two player auction game, but this game is still a welcome addition to my collection. 

I expected this to be a lighter version of Medici, however it's definitely heavier than Medici. 

8 to 7. This game is probably the most unforgiving two player game I have. One mistake in round one is equal to three mistakes in round three. It's still a very strong game, but the tone it has brings its rating score down one.

2 player version of Medici.  With one person's gain is another's loss, it seem the balance can tip too easily -- possibly to the point of being too hard for the losing player to recoup over subsequent rounds.  However, it's about as good as a 2 person auction game can be.

I admit I have not really given it a fair chance, and perhaps with further plays it would start to make sense and be enjoyable.

Extremely mathy if you play optimally.  In fact, when played optimally, this game seems broken.  Both players benefit if they buy at lower auction prices, both players lose if they buy at higher auction prices.  If you can do the math and figure out roughly how many points the tiles on auction are worth to each player if played, you can then figure out an optimal price that is dead even for both players - always buy if you are offered something lower than this price, never buy if you are offered something higher than this price.  The optimal price is the exact mid-point of the approximate point-swings both players will potentially gain by playing the tiles on offer.  Example: if Player A will gain a point swing advantage of 40 points by playing the tiles, and Player B will gain a point swing advantage of 20 points by playing the tiles, then 30 is the magic number that players will want to offer - buying higher than this costs a player more, buying lower than this benefits a player more.  For any given auction, this optimal magic number will be the same for both players, so if both players play optimally, the game will be a matter of just calculating this number, and be very boring.  For more details and the math behind this formula, see here:

There are no penalties for going into negative money so, as one friend put it, it can seem like a race to lose money.

Well I am stunned. Knizia strikes again! He has managed to convert a classic multi-player auction game into a classic 2-player auction game, WITH NO AUCTION! Basically, I offer up the goods at a fixed price, and you either pay it or I do. All the other elements of Medici are there, the weight, the climbing, the bonuses, the zero tiles (cleverly getting two steps now), and having three different sized ships and then having totally cost-free unlimited loans is stunning. What an amazing game! Agonising decisions, we spent several minutes pondering what price to offer at key points. Oh the agony! That was too little, but wait, he needs a loan!!! Getting control of the tile bag is crucial, closing the round early can crush, but what a price you must pay. Top of my must-buy list now. 

***

Bought and played since. Still really enjoying it. A fair bit of luck in the tile drawing, but mitigated by which ship you choose. Still quite a mathematical game. You can sit there and work out the relative costs each tile will cause on your side or on the opponents and decide what to bid or pay. Interesting if you like that kind of qualitative decision.

What a cool, unexpected gem of a game this is!  I never thought I'd see a 2-player auction game that worked, but this one does it very elegantly.  My wife enjoyed it a lot more than I was expecting as well.  There are plenty of opportunities for devious blackmailing, clever plays, and subtle strategy, with still an element of luck as goods are drawn out of the tile bag.  This could very well become my favorite 2-player Euro-game.  I'll probably rate bump this up to a 9 after another couple of plays.  If you're looking for a meaty, 30 minute 2-player game, this one should be on your radar!

To me, MvS is "Container for 2 players" - probably because I played Container before MvS.

This is really fun to play - but be fore-warned... I'd classify it as a "quantitative abstract".  If you like bidding games and you often play with only two players, look no further - This  game really works. There is often significant agony in the decisions, so it must be good!

At first it seems that you can value things based on their expected return, but because of a feature that gives  like-kinds exponential returns, value ends up to be highly dependent on player behavior.  The fundemental characteristic that makes a bidding game good.

Actually it's the only bidding game suitable for two players I know. But the game has one minor problem: there exists an optimal strategy which - properly implemented - makes it impossible for you to loose.

Of course it requires some skill and is difficult but still - it's not a good treat for game. All in all a fine game. Try it ad maybe you'll like it. And until you find this strategy, you'll have many hours of good entertainment.

Somewhere in Tuscany a pair of ruthless bankers circles slowly at arm's length.  With wide eyes and narrow blades, each waits for the perfect moment to stab his rival in the face.  This is the final feud of Medici and Strozzi, and one of the two will be left bleeding in the street.  Your family has taught you to be a shrewd accountant, able to surmise the value of any business deal.  But more importantly, they have taught you how to size up your opponent.  How to find his weakness and then use it to coerce, undermine, gouge and violate him in every possible way.

This is the feeling of playing Medici vs. Strozzi, a game that will grind you to pieces and then laugh at you.  It's twice the game Medici was - and I've always liked Medici!  But now Medici is the kid with a fist full of fat crayons standing next to Leonardo himself.

Seven plays. An intense and thinky game. A fair amount of calculation is required, but there's other stuff going on as well; choosing how many tiles to draw, where to put the tiles you've bought them, and the struggle for control of the bag are as important as correct price evaluation. It's amazing that there's so much to the game considering how short the rules are. The only negative is that it can be a bit opaque at times.

Very tense bidding and valuation game. I'm sure I would do horribly against an opponent who meticulously calculates all the numbers, but for a seat-of-your-pants player like myself, it was pretty fun. It plays much like its ancestor Medici, but it is not as forgiving in the bids. In the original, you could throw out bids just to see what happens. In this one, any bid made will be paid by either you or your opponent, so you must be much more careful. Good game.

With only two players, it is too easy to calculate what your opponent would pay for  anything. Oh, and I hate the tiles; would prefer cards as in the original Medici.

RATING: 5
Obvious similarities with Medici but plays differently since you are only up against one opponent. Will probably take a few plays to start to get the hang of deciding how much things are worth.

I think one of the fun things about Medici is the player interaction and unfortunately with only two players this version falls short.

RATING: 5
Medici vs Strozzi is the 2 player implementation of its larger namesakes. With more influences form Medici, the game focuses on drawing goods, then setting an a price for those goods in hopes to sell the most of each type in the market and/or have the "heaviest" boat. It works quite will as a 2 player version. Some of the major changes is that money is unlimited (there are negative loans). This doesn't really eliminate one player from controlling the market early, so it is important to play conservatively. The other change is with two players, it is much more appealing to bid on good, then discard them to "buy out" the other play. Classic Medici is preferred to this, but Medici vs Strozzi does a good job at a 2 player value speculation game. Much like Knizia's other 2 player games, multiple plays with the same group will uncover more and more depth.

a lot of games for two are either perfect information abstract strategy or card games.  this is neither but a nice 2-player game with quick auctions, nice components and tricky decisions.  On your turn you pick from 1 to 3 tiles from the bag, and propose a price.  your opponent either accepts your offer, or declines and you are left having to buy them so price it wisely.  some interesting options arise at the end of the round as the ships start to fill up.  at this point, you can try to force your opponent to buy something they can't use, because it doesn't fit in their ship.

Knizia can do auctions with two players like no one else. The tension between scoring for large numbers vs. commodity monopolies is great. Less great is the tile-counting and the utterly unthematic tendency for both players to lose money throughout the game. Very good, but I prefer Ra for two.

RATING: 7
Because of the zero-sum nature of the game, it is the quantity of the goods you ship that matters, not the color.  Concentrating on a good color as you do in Medici doesn't work, because then you are just allowing you opponent to concentrate on the other colors.  The game is much more about the flow of the auction and trying to fill your boats before you opponent, or putting them in a situation where they have to pay more to avoid getting shut out.  A useful guideline seems to be to try to maximize the number of effective goods on each boat, while trying to win the $20 bonus (which is actually worth $40 since you are denying the other player).  It's often useful to let your opponent win the first couple of lots, to see what they are doing and respond to it.  If they load 3 low value goods into their 5 boat, you may be able to overtake it with your 3, leaving you with an advantage on the other 2 boats.After a couple of more plays, it's starting to get boring and dry.

Interesting mathematical exercise which feels a bit too grindy for me. This is an exercise in pure valuation.

This, as I see it, means that players need to be able to grind through the act of valuation (and predictive valuation) at somewhat comparable levels in order for there to be a game. When there is, it can be great, but when there isn't... it becomes an unwanted exercise in mathematics.

Very neat adaptation of Medici as a 2 player game. I think I like it even more than Medici. It fixes a few elements of the original game that are the tougher parts for me to deal with, particularly being able to bid on something even though you do not have enough room on your ships' cargo holds. This is necessary for the 2 player game but could help the original as well.

Turns Medici into a two player game by replacing the auction with a make-an-offer mechanic.

I don't know why the spaces on the board weren't labelled 10-20-30 rather than blank-10-20 because the blank spaces are worth 10 and the 10 and 20 spaces are worth 20 and 30!  Crazy.

First played August 20th, 2007.  With knowlege of Medici, this is a quick learn (<10min), however can be a longer game for those in deep thought.  We took about an hour.  This seems a bit intense and the luck/strategy scale dips towards the strategy.  Perhaps too much?  We quickly found each other accepting or passing the bids and feeling that we had somehow missed the bid amount.  See in this version, there is one less resource, and the auctioneer makes a bid and the opponenet either takes it for that amount or lets you have it for that amount.  And wait until your opponent dumps what he bought, just so you can't have it.  I'd recommend giving it a try if you know someone who has it and want to play something different, however I'm not sure that I'd go out of my way after one play.  We certainly talked about it plenty after the game, however I felt after the game that I wasn't sure if I like the mechanics enough to purchase now.

This game preserves all of the tension of that last round of Medici where it is just you versus the other guy, both looking for the magic card that will make your ship.  At the same time, it also adds in a few ingenious considerations (like multiple ships of varying capacities and different commodity mixes at the harbor) so that you don't get the kind of monotony you might experience playing Medici as a two player game.  This is the best small box offering since Roma.

Initial rating one play

If you like auction games and you like 2 player games, this is probably a 'must have' or at least a 'must try' game. Amazingly enough Medici gets boiled down into a 2 player version although there are some significant differences here.

There are 3 markets here, 2 with 3 goods each and 1 with 2 goods. Each good is at 0 to begin and the object is to move it towards your side which creates a nice little tug-a-war effect. You have 3 ships, one for each market and your ships hold 3, 4 or 5 goods. The start player pulls 1 - 3 tiles and then has to come up with a bid. Opponent says 'pay' or pays himself the money to the bank (one time bid). Tile (good) must then be placed on a ship and then ship must then be placed next to a market for influence. Winner pulls next. When one person fills all 3 of his ships the round ends, 3 rounds total.

Scoring is great as usual with the doc, ten points for anything on your side and if it is far enough there is a 10 spot bonus or 20 spot bonus. Ships across from each other are competing, highest total nets 20 points. 

This actually all works SO GOOD that bids are incredibly hard to make really making for great turn angst. Why this happens is that no matter what you bid, you are either going to actually have to pay that amount to the bank or your opponent will. Sounds simple but in practice it can be quite agonizing and even to the point of AP as you are bidding with your victory points here and unlike its father, one bad bid here can really be hard to make back as there is only one other opponent. 

Bids 'can' get a little easier later in the round as some things can be calculated but it is not always the case and could become quite the opposite in fact. There is another HUGE factor here to consider again similiar to the father game but with even more impact. When someone gets close to filling their ships, 2 things can happen. If you are the other person, you might get to pull some "free lots" as the opponent doesn't have enough room on the ship and therefore can't bid. The other scenerio is one person fills right up and ends the round leaving the opponent with some empty spots which really 'smarts'. This really makes for some wild and exciting bidding.

Ranks as one of the only really good auction games for 2 up there with 'RA' and 'GOA'. Shouldn't be judged on a single play as values are harder to determine first game out typical of any auction game.

Our last game differed by 5 points in the score.  This is a nice game and I like the mechanism where you set the price of the tiles and your opponent gets first choice of those tiles at that price.  If they don't buy it, you HAVE to buy it. I also like the art much better than my version of Medici but they could have still done better with color/background selection.

This is a game about figuring out fair prices.  There is a bit of a learning curve to get into this game, but it is quite rewarding in the end.  The components are attractive.  Despite the simple rules, the pricing is quite difficult to get right.  The box is small, and quite portable, and the price of the game is reasonable.  Unfortunately, a good player will normally destroy weaker players, but you can easily remedy that by giving the weaker player a starting money handicap.  Numerical aptitude is a must.  This game might not be to everybody's taste, but it certainly is to mine!

RATING: 5
A game where your sole purpose is to get your opponent to overpay for goods. The problem with the game for me is that it feels like a good mechanic that was taken out of a good game and forced to stand on it's own. The game will appeal to some folks for it's simplicity. The pricing can vary greatly depending on play style. To me the game feels incomplete. There should be another layer, or another factor, in the decisions other than a simple calculation of what my return will be on the lot. The game is nominally interesting, but I can live perfectly well without it. There are more nuanced two-player games.

RATING: 5
Thematically this game is interesting because competition is so fierce between players that they're both slowly losing money. Mechanically it's a nice change of pace from games like Power Grid, where exact investment/reward calculations predominate. Those positives aside, it only takes four plays (which feels like 12, since a single game is three consecutive rounds) for this to get stale. Early on, it only makes sense to bid on single tiles, and to bid "1" on all 1s and 2s. Later, it may make sense to bid on two tiles (rarely three) if your opponent doesn't have the space. Additionally, players will learn quickly not to put themselves in a position in which their opponent leverages the bid with the potential to end the game. 

Nice components, but ultimately not much to see here.

First off, this is an excellent distillation of the Medici system to a 2-player game.  It still feels like you're playing Medici.  The graphic design is a big improvement on the old Medici, though the blues and greens can be a little hard to distinguish, depending on the lighting.  The bidding is extremely difficult - whereas in Medici, on your turn you are in the power seat, able to take advantage of being seated last, in Medici vs. Strozzi, while playing the auctioneer you must set fixed prices.  I've always found the fixed price auctions the hardest in Modern Art, and they are very challenging here.  When your opponent quickly says, "I'll take it." you know you did something wrong!

The bidding can be extremely brutal and cutthroat too.  Being able to bid on any set of goods, even if you cannot fit them on your ship really makes price evaluation a constant struggle.  Your opponent can (and should) continually push you to spend the maximum amount possible.

The one thing that you really have to be careful of is the end of round condition.  Allowing your opponent to only have a 2 or 3 spaces left on a single ship is very dangerous - you almost have to buy so as to not fall behind in filling ships.  Your opponent can then make you pay through the nose just to fill your ships with items you may not even want, just so you don't fall behind.

The tension rises each round, I like how the pyramid system here has been transformed into a sliding scale.  This actually makes the game a little prone to A/P problems.  I was surprised how long it took me to make my move sometimes.

Still, with the right partner, this is a great game.  Those that don't enjoy Medici may not like this, but as a Medici fan this is a really cool game - Knizia does it again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of the best 2 player games around. The game is very simply about setting prices for various goods in order to earn money to win the game.

The beauty of this game is that it is psychological (a bit like poker); you have to play your opponent. You don't always have to set a rational price, you can try to psyche your opponent out and get them to spend more than they should have.

One of the best 2 player games I have ever played - Many Different levels of thought are required - not just being a calculator. Position is very important to consider in cost, what turn your on, what boat you use, if you want to try to shut out your challenger... etc. I assume there's even more levels of understanding as well! WOW!!! Rated an 8. Update: I stopped playing this game due to it's lack of fun. It has a constant aggressive feel to it based on my style of play. It feels like I'm pounding someone into the floor with each bid - the constant hard decision forced aggression makes me not want to play this game ever. I play games with friends and family, not true opponents. I don't want either side to feel lesser after a game. Not good in my opinion. I'm glad it's no longer in my collection.

Based on 4 plays.  MvS is a good two player auction game, which is certainly a rarity.   People justly complain that, toward the end of a round, it's relatively easy to determine the exact value of a set to yourself and your opponent.  After a few plays, though, it becomes clear that these calculations are not quite so cut-and-dry as critics might suggest.  But unfortunately they remain an almost necessary component of playing well.  As a consequence of this and other factors, the game is very intense and a bit exhausting.

Azt kell, hogy mondjam, meglepődtem, hogy milyen jól működik ez a játék. Nagyon komoly taktikázásra, kombinálásra van szükség. Nem lehet csak úgy kiszúrni a másikkal, hogy én jól járjak, mert simán visszafelé sülhet el a tervem. Ha valaki fogékony a pszichológiára, ebben bőven van, és tényleg át lehet élni benne ezt a kereskedős érzést.
Egy (illetve kettő) dolog zavar egy kicsit. Egyrészt szimpatikus, hogy akkor is lehet költeni pénzt, ha éppen nincs tőke, hiszen a banktól felvehetsz kölcsönt, amit persze vissza kell fizetni, de arról nincs szó, hogy kamatot kell-e fizetni érte. Márpedig szerintem az úgy lényegesen életszerűbb, és nem kell eltúlozni ezt a kamatot, de azért valamennyivel legyen több a törlesztés, mint a kölcsön. Így ugyanúgy megvan a lehetőség, hogy egy játékos akkor is vásároljon, ha már elköltötte a pénzét, tehát nem esik ki a játékból néhány nagyobb befektetés miatt, de azért azt is figyelembe kell akkor venni, hogy valamennyi a banknak is jár.
A másik, hogy a zöld és kék szín az értékelőtáblán az én szememnek túlságosan hasonló árnyalatú. Én az a típus vagyok, aki úgy gondolja, hogy a türkiz, mályva, padlizsán és társaik nem színeket jelölnek. Nem tudok róla, hogy színtévesztő lennék, de rögtön az első körben sikerült úgy kikötnöm, hogy azt hittem a kékről, hogy zöld (vagy fordítva?)... Sajnos ez a tévedés súlyos aranyakba került nekem. :D

Nagyon tetszik, mert egy gyors lefolyású, erősen gondolkodtató játék, és kiegyenlítettnek tűnik, hacsak nem halmozzuk a rossz döntéseket.

This game screws with my mind because both times I've played it we both ended up with less money than we started with, but it's pure awesomeness and just as much fun as Medici is with more players. While playing this it struck me again how brilliant Knizia is.

RATING: 4.5
I don't think I've ever felt quite so 'whatever' about a game. It's a big math problem where, at the end of it, you're sure you forgot to carry a zero somewhere. I far prefer regular Medici.

Another play has only confirmed my earlier befuddlement with this one. I think I'm just not a fan of tug-o-war games. [b]3[/b]

Further play has shown that it's not a total stinker, yet still not very good. [b]4.5[/b]

Tough game. Some luck element would make this game better - now it's a bit too calculable and dry. Well, it still works surprisingly fine, but is far from Medici (which is by the way an excellent game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
And yes, another Knizia that is better after second play. If played with a good opponent, it is as good as Medici - but while it can be seen the first time with Medici, you need to get used to the changes in Medici vs. Strozzi to see the differences and how differently you have to play this one.
Medici is more elegant. Medici vs. Strozzi is meaner. Sometimes I prefer this, sometimes that.

Carries much of the flavor of the multiplayer game, but feels much more vicious.  I'm thinking it will take at least a couple plays to really get a feel for how to value the lots.  As well, one must be careful not to lose sight of the different harbors and consider all possible plays at all three harbors...there can be some dramatic swings in scoring from round to round!

An unrelenting tug-of-war between shrewd business men (and women!) as players go head-to-head to load valuables on ships to set sail!  Will you outbid the cargo's worth or be forced to do so?  Will you tip the scales and have the most valuable ships with the right cargo to get the biggest payoffs?  

While this tense bidding game may feel a bit like work at times, bluffing and clever purchases warrant both smug smirks and all the trash talk worthy of the a sailor! A Hoy!

RATING: 8
Pure two-player boardgames for fans of heavier games are pretty scarce, outside of two-player abstracts. Medici vs. Strozzi is the main counterexample that comes to mind, and, frankly, a lot of people would dismiss it as being pretty abstract, too. It combines the set collecting mechanics from Medici and weds them to the fixed price auction from Modern Art, and adds a dash of tug of war. The result is a bit mathy, a bit hard on the head, but very interesting if, like me, you are the right sort of gamer.

The nominal theme, shared with its cousins, Medici and Strozzi, plus lord knows how many other German games, is that the players are top merchants in Renaissance Florence, representing the strategic heads of the Medici and Strozzi clans. Tiles are drawn from a bag by the active player, most of which are goods tiles that have a type and a value, and once he is content with the lot, he names a price for them. The other player may then pay the price or pass, and if he passes, the active player *must* pay the named price. The player that buys the lot becomes the new active player, so there is control at stake as well as goods. The winning player must place his goods on one of his three boats, each of which has a different destination which demands different types of goods.

Play is broken into three rounds, which end when one player or the other fills all three of his boats. Players then score money/VPs (oh, right, your VPs are money) based on who has the highest numerical value of goods at each island, and who has the advantage in each of the types of goods and island demands. Advantages in the types of goods are tracked, and you must overcome an opponent’s advantage from previous rounds before you can prevent him from scoring and begin scoring that advantage yourself, so there is a persistent element throughout the game which can produce distinct strategies.

All of this is about as mathematical as it sounds, especially at the end of a round since money/VPs are open knowledge. Toward the end of the game the situation can become perfectly calculable, which some will find heightens the tension and others will find insufferable. Also, it’s important to play with resignations, instead of drawing everything out to the bitter end, since a player with a large lead can create “buy or die” situations that are just annoying to play out.

I enjoy Medici vs Strozzi a lot, but I can completely understand why it is not every gamer’s cup of tea. While it is tactically rich and strategically interesting, it is also mathematical, which many folks find really dry, even if they normally like heavy euros. I look forward to playing Medici vs Strozzi more, but I’d hesitate to ask someone to try it again after they said they’d tried it and didn’t enjoy it.

The overall auction mechanic is alot like Medici, as well as the choices how you load your tiles. 

The unique thing here is the "tug of war" that the central board represents for scoring. 

I like this one alot, but more plays are needed before I "get it" and can raise it's score.

Seemingly a math heavy game. Yet, seems to be enjoyed by people who don't overly focus on the dollars and cents of an auction and simply go with the flow. 

Given that this is a 2 player game, it might see its way to the table more than Medici. Also, it plays faster.

Medici (although higher ranked than MvS) may be worth waiting for.

I was hoping for a bit more, but I have only played 2 games.  I bought it as a game my wife and I could enjoy, but it just didn't do too much for us. Hopefully with a couple more games I'll start to "get" it a bit more.

The rules are pretty simple (though I had to look up a couple of things for clarification since it's not the greatest translation), and the games go pretty quickly.

RATING: 6
This will need another play to really click -- I finished my first game with a negative score, but had fun getting there.

It's got what I expect from a Knizia design: lots of turn angst and great decisions packed into a small footprint. But it also has a layer of psychology, risk assessment, and other "soft" decision-making that's really interesting.

I wish the tiles were easier to tell apart, and that the goods tracks on the harbors were better-differentiated, but apart from that the components are excellent.

Three years later my first play was my only play. I've got so many better two-player games that this one was just taking up space. Sold it.

RATING: 8
Auction games usually don't work well with 2 players. This one is better because there is no overbidding. It all comes down to calculation of each lot worth but this is never clear cut as you might value something for the future or even just to get to choose the next tiles. Very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another clever and addictive two player game from Knizia! Medici vs. Strozzi actually reminds me a lot of Modern Art in that its value estimation game with some limited control over resource availability.I would recommend against playing this with anyone prone to long bouts of analysis paralysis because its possible to sit there for five minutes on each turn and determine quite precisely the values. This takes a lot away from the game and Id probably only rate it a 6 if played that way. The spirit of the game is to quickly estimate the value as best you can.The graphic design is poor. The boats are too big for the harbours, its very difficult to differentiate the good types and the zero value tiles dont indicate they are worth double for goods monopolies. If this is what the Medici reprint will look like then i dont think youre any worse off with the old one.

This game really succeeds at being Medici for two and has a lot going for it mechanically.  You must balance a number of calculations and assessment of risks along with the psychological aspects of what your opponent will be willing to pay.  Alas after several plays I find the game has sort of worn me out.  I've never finished with more money than I started with and somehow winning or losing games by being the "least negative" score isn't fulfilling to me.

04/25/09 Played once. I enjoyed the game and look forward to playing it many more times. It looks nice overall. But I'm not a fan of the art work in general. Its kind of hard to tell which pastel good is which. The black marker cubes are too large. They overflow their spaces. If they'd used the ubiquitous 10 mm wooden cubes that wouldn't have been an issue. For some reason they used ones about 13 mm.

I got this game, and then wasn't quite sure whether I wanted it after all. One play was enough to quell that fear. There is a lot more fun contained in this game than you could envisage given the theme - BECOME ONE OF THE TWO FLORENTINE RIVALS AND COMPETE TO SHIP GOODS - as my gaming buddy said "I've dreamed of that ever since my youth!!!". To enjoy it you'll need an opponent who has a similar mathematical inclination as the game could be spoiled otherwise. I particularly enjoy buying my opponents goods and then just throwing them in the sea because I don't want to load them myself.

A 2 player bidding game that will become a classic. You have to know the real worth of the tiles after a few plays to enjoy it. New players tend to offer too much (always more than 15). If both players end with less than 300 of gold you have to improve your skill at bidding!

How can a 2 player auction game work? This game answers that question very well indeed.

Ooh how I hate that dastardly Cosimo Medici! Countless are the times when I (always playing as Filippo Strozzi) thought I'm winding up my opponent to buy some overprized goods... just in order to realize that, in fact, I have driven myself to bankruptcy. Very clever 2-player bidding game that, in my experience, is often a very close call and a thight t(h)ug-of-war between the two arch-nemeses, often decided by the smallest margin. The bidding mechanism works surprisingly well for a two-player game. Like San Juan, it looks like it will take a while before I get the strategies figured out. Main problem is that it is a very dry game, fun is not a factor and a dry game would need additional depth.
The game has also taught me that Strozzi's reputation as a clever merchant was largely down to hype.

Not as good as Medici and not as good as Strozzi, but a solid 2 player auction game all the same. What initially seems to be a cut and dried exercise in valuation reveals itself to be full of nuance and considerations of the game state, risk, and timing. The auction itself is a constant state of fear, in which you worry that your opponent might take advantage of your poor pricing decisions. Rewards repeat play.

Very much a 2-player Modern Art. Largely dependent on having two players of the same skill and a good valuing brain. When you get it right, and be warned it will take a while, there's a bundle of good tactics to be had here. Disappointing and confusing colour scheme which really wasn't necessary.

Further Thoughts: does this really have the replayability which we originally pegged it for? It's a fine back-and-forth game, there's no doubt, but it does weigh heavy on the soul.

I actually enjoy this game more than its big brother.  Then again, I enjoy two player games more than the average BGG inhabitant seems to.

Valuation is certainly table-dependent in this game, but that's not such a bad thing, especially when you consider the price paid for being tile-short at the end of a round.  It can really drive up the attention, and it makes you pay even more attention to the state of the game than you do in Medici.

Medici vs Strozzi captures the essense of Medici beautifully, and improves it I think, reducing a player's dependency on others (in the multi-player game) doing the right thing and giving you the option of buying goods and chucking them out, forcing both players to enter 'right' bids. Nothing goes for cheap in this one. Sadly, I really don't like Medici and so while the game impressed me, I didn't enjoy playing it. Too much calculation, too much work, not enough surprise. You're just bidding against each other all game. If you like that sort of thing, this one's a treat for you. If you don't, nothing needing exploring here.

Diabolical little two player game. Theres a lot of suffering in that little box.  

At first it seems to be a simple pricing game.  But it is not simple: it challenges at every point, defies clear analysis, and keeps suspense up until the end, all as you try in vain to do the math.  

Screwage?  Most definitely. Watch your opponent's face when you suddenly price his must-have chit at 4 times what he thought was the going rate.

There is a flaw, however. Unfortunately it incentivizes players into a race to lose money.  So if you love economic models, this is not it.

Only 2 plays in, this one seems brutal.  Forcing the high bid once you get a few more goods than your opponent just gets ugly.

Auctions that work for two players. In reality this is a tug of war game where the measure of the winner is on the money gained. The luck of the draw on the tiles and a couple of situations (like having your boats almost full while your opponent does not) allow for some very interesting calculations. This can be very mathy and it would be completely deterministic would it not be for the random draw of tiles from the bag.

Meh. It was a headache to try to figure out what stuff was worth and not really fun. With more plays this game would be tighter but then just come down to whoever did the math the best. Some interesting decisions with where to place the goods...but again, mostly comes down to math. Theme suffers since you almost always end up losing money over the course of the game. Edit: We were playing one rule wrong (alternating bag control instead of giving it to the winner of the auction) but I don't expect this would change my opinion much.

Bought on a whim. I find it has more depth than Medici due to the assigning of the boats, the ability to buy goods and discard them, the winner of each auction retaining the opening bid and the end conditions for each round. Unfortunately it's just a bit too heavy on the arithmetic, but enjoyable never-the-less. Needs to be played quickly without overthinking the values of everything, otherwise it'll get dull fast. Some people enjoy the mind games and calculation more than others. The game does tend to keep players on the edge of their seats.

I used to wonder at the people who claimed [i]Medici[/i] required a lot of calculation - but now I understand.  As a multi-player game, I didn't find myself spending too much time figuring out everyone else's motives, but in this two-player version there is little else to do.  To me, it actually feels a bit like [i]Modern Art[/i], where you're trying to find that balance between values that are constantly shifting.  What saves the game from being the sort of bean-counting exercise I avoid is the hand-management-like use of the ships and harbors, a classic Knizia touch that elevates the game beyond the mundane.  This is not a game for anybody or anytime, but I like it.

I really didn't like what this game did to me as a game player (because all the exact values for everything is out in the open I found myself not being able to NOT spend ages calculating the precise value of everything) - not that I think it's a 'bad' game and could well understand others enjoying it - it's just that I didn't enjoy it and I doubt very much whether I'll be going back there again.

Medici vs Strozzi --
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A huge game of calculated chicken: players pull goods tiles out of a bag and put them up for auction. They state a price and opponent has a choice to buy them if not the auctioneer has to buy them. Good are then loaded on ships and placed at docks which then determine their final value and score (a mix of majorities and values). The 'stock market' values of goods are actually held over from round to round (brilliant idea).

The game works well with two players but really requires players to not only understand the psychology of their opponent but crunch numbers to get the most out of their auction without paying too much too. Too much maths and really needs players to understand the base values of the tiles. Great idea but somehow too dry for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.86
Amazingly good.  It seems much better than simple Medici, but I played this version first.  I like how the "zero" tiles are worth both double and nothing unlike conventional Medici.  Letting your opponent obtain too many "lots" together can be dangerous.  You probably need to have the winning bid at least one-third of the time or more.  Otherwise your opponent can seemingly threaten to run out the clock.  "I bid 50."  "Fifty!?  What do you mean you bid 50?  Oh, I see.  You, #&@*.  I hope you and the bank choke on it."

While this uses mostly the same system, Medici vs Strozzi plays out quite differently than the original game.  

This is a nice enough little tug of war game, where you have to spend most of your efforts to make things more inconvienient for the other guy, and then hope that you get some luck on your side.  Mostly this is about abstract valuation, which turns this more into a puzzle where you try to figure out how to drain your opponent's money away faster than they drain you.  

I find that the game is a little too mathy for my tastes.  It is missing the reward of knowing when to not get involved that the original game relied on.  It just doesn't have the spark that vanilla Medici has for me.

All I know is that Medici and Strozzi suck at being merchants, after all that work neither end up with as much as they start with and have no assets to show for it.  What maroons!

Its a seemingly simple auction game where players draft goods tiles out of a bag, submit a bid and load goods onto a ship. Monopolies for goods in the different ports provide bonuses at the end of each round with three rounds in total. You start with $300 and whomever has the most kizzash at the end of round three wins. Surprisingly, this game took much longer than expected (1.5 hrs) and was filled with tough decisions. A tight game and I loved it. Ended up edging my opponent by $2 for the win. We did play one rule wrong which is if all three of your boats are filled the round ends. We had thought the only end round condition was when the last tile was picked from the bag. Oh well, will correct that in the replay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a surprisingly tricky game.  Do you win bids early to threaten to fill your ships while your opponent has half-empty holds, or do you let your opponent commit first, hoping to eke out slight margins of victory for the harbor totals and control the monopoly markers?

I wondered how Knizia would create a two player version of Medici and the end result is impressive.  The auction mechanic reminds me of the fixed price auctions in Modern Art and there are a ton of factors to consider when weighing each decision.  Much more of a brain burner than Medici and a very solid game.

As the strategy differs from Medici, I keep comparing it.  It seems that the rules for Medici allow people to generally make money.  However, in Medici vs Strozzi there is incentive to bid more than makes sense from a profit point of view.  Very often both players will make a loss, and the less loss is the winner...  I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.  I prefer it to make more sense rationally...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very mathematical, in the sense that is possible to exactly calculate the value of different lots. But I try to do that, and still lose to players who play from the gut. There's a lot more to this game than number crunching, that's for sure. I probably won't find many takers for Medici vs. Strozzi, but I'm quite enamoured with this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Medici vs Strozzi seems like a cute little game.  It's easy to learn and quick to play.  Hidden within are a ton of challenging decisions.  

I find it novel that it doesn't matter if you actually make money, since the object is merely to do better than your opponent.  There are reviews where people detail their very rigid valuation calculations, but there is very little mathematical basis to them.  You are playing your opponent, and your valuation must account for her valuation or you will certainly lose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a strong 2 player game with extremely painful decisions especially during the first two rounds where the final effects of those decisions are hidden in the future.This is NOT a math excercise.  I'm not sure what game these people are plaing that complain of this, but only the final round can be seen *somewhat* as a math excercise.  Because the round ends when either of the players fills all 3 boats, or when the extremely limited tiles run out, I defy you to understand how the *math* will work out.  There is so much in the hands of each player that such an argument is ridiculous!

It is however, highly confrontational and so should be played between players who can handle such games.

Medici/Strozzi fulfills its brief admirably:  It really is Medici stripped down brilliantly to make the ideal, best possible Medici game for two players.  I rate Medici itself a 6, and I give Medici/Strozzi every bit of that same 6... plus a tip for not screwing up.

RATING: 7
[RGG 2006 edition] {couple, economic; auction, commodity speculation} MvS is a thematic, challenging and interactive 2p game. A player sets a price for a set of commodity and the opponent either accepts it and pay or rejects it and the player must purchase the set himself. Setting an appropriate price is very important to avoid giving advantages to your opponent. In addition, players have to decide carefully the number of tiles to be selling. Player can force the opponent waste money buying useless tiles if he/she has more loaded ships because only one player can have three ships loaded. If one player has loaded 2 ships, the opponent will have pressure to buy tiles and load ships. Therefore, control in setting price is important and that's why Strozzi is the first player in the 2nd and 3rd rounds. Since the monopoly markers are moved based on the tiles on the loaded ships and remain for the future rounds, the first round is quite important. A player can't let the opponent claim monopoly of too many tiles in the harbors.  It involves many calculations but it's still fun and not taxing.

It's probably 'best in class' just that the class feels a little forced, scripted and zero-sum, but it's remarkably clever.

RATING: 7.6
This is a really fun game.  I almost love it.  I rate it slightly less than Knizia's beloved 'Medici' simply because the nature of the 2-player bidding mechanism creates a very analytical style of gameplay.  With extra players in the mix, the bidding in 'Medici' is always dynamic and less predictable; you don't have to eat every bid.  In contrast in MvS you do have to eat every bid, which means you can't afford to make too many casual evaluations.  Consequently, the game box should probably come with a warning from the Surgeon General: "While playing 'Medici vs. Strozzi' some individuals may fall into deep chasms of analysis paralysis requiring professional resuscitation to full consciousness." So instead of relying on smelling salts we usually play with a sand-timer.  

Another caveat:  I personally am fine playing analytical games of this sort more or less by the seat-of-my-pants.  I find the idea of developing a strategic intuition to be appealing, so the fact that MvS includes some luck-of-the-draw that is tied to the first bidder does not bother me.  I actually like that extra bit of uncertainty.  The problem is that many lovers of analytical abstracts do not feel this way.  If you are annoyed by the tile-drawing in 'Tigris & Euphrates', there's a good chance you won't dig MvS.  On the other hand, if you are frustrated by the smidgeon of chaos that characterizes bidding in 'Medici', you may actually prefer the stripped-down version of Knizia's classic.

Wow! A two-player version of Medici that preserves pretty much everything I like about the original boardgame and adds several new layers of depth. One key, elegant change is the tug-of-war on the commodities track, meaning that no type of goods can be ignored by either player, a big departure from the original game in which players pretty much had to specialize in one or two areas. This extremely elegant and fine-tuned design presents agonizingly - and wonderfully - difficult choices. A bit of a "thinky" game, verging on being something of a brain-burner. There's a LOT going on here, and it's pretty much all good.

Once the ships start to fill up, it can become possible to analyse the exact cost vs. benefit of each tile to each player which I found to be painful as I'm not that analytical and would rather have an extra random element than a game that can grind to a halt in the final auction while both players do equations in their heads.

Gag me with a spoon.  I don't want to play any game in which one minor mistake can cost you everything, and where everything must be calculated out to the exact number or you lose.

Ouch, i will definitely not want to play this again! That's why the low rating, despite some elegance and cleverity of the design (I like Medici quite a bit). This game, is more than any other game i have played so far, a true min-maxing zero-sum excercise. No hidden information - s*it you could even write an algorithm to find the optimal solution each step!

RATING: 7.5
Clearly a good design and much better than I would expect a 2 player version of an auction game to be.  Still, it is fairly math heavy, perhaps more so than I would want a two player game to be.  I tend to prefer lighter two player fare.

This is a superb exercise in price setting. I used to like it better. I find it rather dry now.

RATING: 5
Lowered rating from about 7 down to 5

One of Medici vs. Strozzi's biggest problems is that both players can be in the hole with the one "least bankrupt" winning.  Still, I'd rather play this than the severely overrated Lost Cities.

With multiple players straight Medici is still the best game.

This one was bit a disappoinment. It is very hard to find right prices but eventually game wasn't fun at all. Mechanically it works very well.

Two conclusions after playing twice: I'm not too fond of bidding games and bidding with two is quite ridiculous, and never I got even the slightest idea I was representing the Strozzi family at an auction.

This is a great game.  Hard to figure out how to bid especially for new gamers but may be a good intro game for some.  Who would have thought a 2-person auction game could work?

Not a big fan of bidding games and this one is no exception.  The mechanism is what I call chicken.  A player picks 1-3 tiles at random and sets a price.  The opponent then either buys them or passes.  The player drawing the tiles must buy them if the opponent passes.  Purchased goods are put on a single ship or discarded.  When the tiles are gone or one player's ships are full the round ends.  Goods counter in each of the 3 harbors get pulled to the side with the most of that kind of goods, bonuses are paid for have the counters on your side and for having the heaviest ship in each harbor(measured by numbers on the goods).  There are 3 rounds, he with the most money wins.

This is a remarkable distillation of Medici down to a two-player game, right down to the auctions.  It helps that the original game was a one-time-around auction game, because that's essentially what you're doing here, as well, by stating the price and giving the other player the option to accept or decline.  The markets are a bit of an improvement over the single one in Medici, because you can turn your attention elsewhere when you get shut out of one.  There's still a weird valuation thing that happens in the game, where the value to you is much less than it is to the other player, but you still have to pay to keep him from getting it.  I still can't get my mind around that aspect of the game, but it's still fun.  Anyone who likes Medici should give this one a go.

Medici is one of my favorite games and being able to play a 2P version would be awesome! UPDATE: Checked out the rules at CHITAG.  Looks like a brilliant re-working for 2P.  Super high on my wish list. Just ordered. Awaiting shipment. UPDATE: Never hits the table. We hate it. With only 2P, bidding mechanism seems completely broken.

Have played it a couple of times. It seemed to degenerate into lots of calculation and analyzing various possibilities towards the end of each round. Lots of potential for analysis paralysis( atleast for me). Just not my type of game. Probably will not play again. First Knizia design that i really don't like.

The market-making game; pricing uncertainty.  Excellent economic game in which one sets prices on lots of goods and bonuses.  Entails taxing mental calculations -- but very fun in my book.

Cute 2er version of Medici.  I think it shows some extreme valuation problems in my head :P Some of the goods types are too similar, in my opinion,  although it's not too hard to pick apart with some effort.

Tile counting would probably help,  although I'm definitely too lazy for it.

This is a fine bidding/strategy game. The two player bidding mechanism is quite nicely implemented.  Packs a lot of great decisions and strategy into 30 - 45 minutes.

For couple of plays were ok but further plays really crashed this game. It's not only dry and calculative but just plain boring. I don't find any challenge or fun in this game. This is the first Knizia game I play that really didn't go over very well (and I like Knizia games). Luckily he has more than enough other games to make up for :)

RATING: 8
Surprisingly deep for such a simple ruleset.
Highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart. Also, newcomers to the hobby will get crushed with this one; this is one of the games where years of Eurogaming make a huge difference.

RATING: 7.3
[EDIT] After my second and third games I appreciate it much more. Still, replayability is probably low ...but the tension in doing the prices is... priceless!!
The best would be to have someone who explains to me the most logical way to estimate prices with a mathematically sound reason.
---------------
very knizian 2 players game with simple rules, some luck and a good deal of auction-ability needed. The very first game we started with extremely high prices and the first who understood that just stopped buying therefore winning. 
hence, i'd say, u need more than a game to gauge your bids.
Probably it suffer of low replayability as nothing changes from one game to the other.
Rating could raise when i'll have played a true balanced game

Played once. An interesting adaptation of Medici as a game for two players. Of course it plays differently than the board game, and I found it to be more enjoyable. Decisions are tense and evaluating how much a set is worth is tricky.

RATING: 7.5
Brain-burny 2 player auction game. The "auction" is instead a direct contest to see who can better evaluate the worth of a set of goods, but it is difficult and can be interesting to work out. Very much a gamer's game.

This is after only 2 games, so the rating is still tentative.

RATING: 7
This is more of a meta-game than anything else. What is the fair value of the goods going to be and how much do you value a good over what your opponent does. The game is relatively short mitigating the randomness of the goods draws. The game also rewards you for adapting rapidly to new situations and using probability to forsee the future goods draws.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Perfect for the person who enjoys screwing their opponent over again and again. This is a light game with a fiercely cutthroat quality to it - something I enjoy, but others may not like. It is *almost* an auction game, with a few differences. Not bad overall, and certainly replayable.

RATING: 4
Reasonable attempt to translate the gameplay of Medici into a two-player game. However, the strategic consequences of the rules are such that the game ends up being depressingly negative, constantly buying whatever your opponent needs just to throw it away and stop them from getting it. Ends up coming down to who loses the least, not gains the most.

Although I can see that it's well-balanced and challenging, both my opponent and I walked away feeling cranky and frustrated, so I wouldn't play again.

Nice little game. The bidding take a while to get used to  - bid too high and it's the person with the least negative score who wins. Not sure I'm a big fan of the "take as much as you want from the bank" rule...

Ok, but the bidding mechanics mean that you both can end up with minus points - both in debt, but still there is a winner...

RATING: 3
This is not my kind of game. 2-player euros are for starters not my favorite kind of games, but this one is pure math and nothing else, all the information is in the open so you can always calculate exact values. I failed to see the fun, and while being allowed to go into debt is good so a player doesn't fall completely out of the game. However, allowing both players unlimited loans turns this into a game of being least in debt. Not fun.

RATING: 5
I have never played the original Medici, so I can't compare, which may be either a good thing or a bad thing. I played half a game, but it didn't excite me in any way, mostly because I didn't have a clue what a set of tiles would be worth. Perhaps further playings would improve my understanding and perhaps also my rating of the game.

It feels like Ra, but I just haven't been able to wrap my head around it.  It isn't just that I have lost, but I am losing badly.  (like 305-134...)  It might go up if I can figure it out.  

Update:  I just can't seem to like this one.  I hate the fact that we seem to get scores below the starting point of 300...

After 1 Play: I really like auction games, and I think of myself as pretty good at evaluating items, even on the first play.  That said, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing in this game.  I'd give it another try, but I'm not sure that's going to help.

Interesting, very playable adaptation of the seminal Knizia game "Medici". As others have said, it can be a bit "mathy", but it can be a lot of fun if you don't calculate too much and just go with your instincts when setting the price.

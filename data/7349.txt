RATING: 9
One of the greatest wargames ever made.  It captures the topic beautifully.  The rules are clear and not too long, but have enough detail to keep it rooted in reality.  Playing 4 scenarios will create the more exciting part of the war before it becomes a stalemate.  Or for a twist, you could play the campaign, that covers the same time frame, but brings in things like nukes, Soviets, and a Formosa invasion.

This is one of the shining examples of why Victory Games was the greatest wargame company ever.  Once I get more plays under my belt, I see this going to 10.

RATING: 7
Rating based on my memory of the 2 campaigns I played way back then. The game is great but hampered by the fact that the two greatest surprises in the war (the landing in In'chon and the Chinese intervention) aren't really surprises here and can be managed/avoided. I wish some mechanic had been devised to make both events stick closer to reality.

I gave this game away when I was trying to drastically cut down my collection, but... I used to play it a lot in the 90s, it is a good depiction of the military campaign in a straightforward IGOUGO, hex-and-counter system. I like the chrome of various nationalities and some optional units (IIRC, some Soviet and Taiwanese units are available).

I bought this second hand after I ummed and aahed too long in the store when it was originally published and so missed the boat! Not a bad simulation, surprisingly well balanced given the subject matter but the given victory criteria are cruel indeed as I discovered when I played all the scenarios with a friend last year.

RATING: 7
Very innovative game that sparked my interest in the Korean War. I love the political aspect where players can chose their level of commitment and roll to see if the conflict escalates. 
It long playtime, big map, and ugly graphics means that I dont get to play it often, but it is in many ways my inspiration for my own game design on the Korean War using Academy Games Fog of War system.

RATING: 9
This game encourages a tightly fought campaign by tempting the players to take risks for the big victory points.  The campaign will sweep up and down the map inline with the changing fortunes of the two sides.

Logistics are key, ultimately it is stretched supply line that bring your offensives to an end.  The game stands out in my collection of 80's games it is the keeper.

VG is still my wargaming super group.  This was one their best albums and am a huge fan.

Korea is no longer just another item on a cold war check list.  Korea tested the post war American Army almost to the point of distruction, it was General MacArthurs lowest and highest points, it made China a regional super power, fractured the relationship between Bejing and Moscow, brought the USA and Russia close to direct conflict and was perhaps the UNs finest moment etc..  This was not a prelude to the main event Vietnam this was every bit as important.

Play this game.

Perhaps Balkoski's best game design ever, BGG's overall rating for this game is ludicrous, and perhaps best explained by the overall lack of popular interest in the Korean War.  The system used in this game is not only one of the most elegant ever found in a conflict simulation, but perhaps the most elegant ever for simulating both mobile warfare and the logistics of supply.  A real gem of a game.

Nice game, where airpower and supply seem to be well modelled. Have played the opening scenario a number of times and it's always fun to see if the UN forces can hold on. Complaint - can't seem to model the Inchon landing and it's subsequent effect (cutting of North's supply around Pusan resulting in total collapse of red position) - never seem to get enough units ashore to fan out and cut supply.

at this stage, this is the best hex and counter i've played. Both sides get to attack, there is plenty of room for out flanking and cutting lines, a bit book keeping heavy but this adds lots of wider context to the conflict with the UN commitment levels etc. This is a very very good war game. Has a manageable density of counters and a reasonable play time too.

This is a fine, fine game with excellent mechanics and great replay value. In fact, it is the only game I know where both players will find themselves repeatedly on the offensive and defensive. Anyone interested in the Korean War and not afraid of a little necessary complexity should own it. Although after repeated playing you may find a need for a very few minor house rules. For example: as written, the UN player need never actually end his turn as there is no limit on the number of times he may break-down and build-up the same US unit. 

Bottom line: For grognards, this is one exceptional game.

RATING: 4
This deserves the praise it usually gets, but I didn't really care for it and it's hard to say why. "She was a nice girl, but...." type game. It cleverly executes the strategic picture and it's possible to bring on an early WWIII. The mechanics are the ancestor of the designer's later Lee Vs. Grant and The Great Campaigns of the American Civil War, which I really like. But this...maybe it's a tad too abstract for my tastes. All the pieces on a side are the same ("cookie cutter"). I'm about to accuse it of following the same pattern every time, but what Korean War game doesn't? Luck plays a large role early in the game (initiative and number of activations). All things considered, I have too many other games that, should I bring this out again, this becomes another learning curve all over again.

RATING: 9
very good system, esp. considering the time period this game was released.  The initiative system allows the play to go back-and-forth, so there is very little downtime for a hex-and-counter game.

the scenarios work pretty well, and don't take long to play.  Given that the Incheon landing and Chinese intervention will certainly not be a surprise to either player (history ignorant grognard?), I am not sure that the campaign game would work.  It would certainly take several plays of the campaign to know what a good choice would be for the strategic plans (intervention level, tension level, etc.).

the combat system seems to lack a certain amount of tension, as the results are pretty easy to guess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent: Korean War - Strategic/Operational - Medium 

Plus:
-Great theme
-Great map
-Great rule book. Lot's of rules but a nice read 
-Innovative core system, rules are failry easy but you can use optional rules to make it even more interesting
-Great scenario's with optional Russians etc.
-Low counter densitiy

Down:
-Counter art (very small italics / icons)
-Quite some rules involved so it takes a lot of referring to the rule book when playing. 

Amazing how little appeal this seems to have. Well Korea is also called the forgotten war so I guess it has to do with this. 

Like Against the Reich, another great game of the great Balkoski. Interesting topic that has it all: North Koreans, Chinese intervention, Russian intervention, Nuclear threat: what more you need in a wargame?!

The scenario's are great and all depends on the positioning of your depots (like Against the Reich)Especially the campaign game is interesting as you are able to commit more troops, but you raising the danger of intervention. A classic whithout the acclaim it deserves. If you can get your hands on it, buy it as you won't regret. Thankfully I have a copy!

Finally got a copy and played it. See my session two reports. Fantastic wargame; makes my top 10 - probably top 5 ever. 

Incredibly well integrated strategic operational game. VERY innovative combat and supply system; still state of art 30 years after being published. Rulebook is among best ever making this game easily accessible. And, yet, the game is beefy: lots of choice, lots of tension strung out over 15 to 20 hours.

The decision model generated for each player by this design produces GREAT play value. I do hope a designer or two uses the some of these concepts as a basis for other strategic operational games. Balkoski's logistics mechanic makes supply considerations an important component of military success: what a novel concept in wargames!

This 1986 release is incredible fun as players attempt to counter one another. Great care went into this simulation making it fun from beginning to end. Escalations have political consequences as army's battle for dominance of the Korean peninsula. A game I highly recommend both as an educational tool and to play just for the joy of it.

An elegant design that captures the operational aspects of the campaign. The map is gorgous, and the scale is perfect, ... it  makes the terrain varied and details important leading to tense and interesting battles within the campaign. The one fault is that hindsight will prevent most NK players from making the same mistake at Inchon.

One of the VG title that I do not want to own a copy (very few of these) originally.  It is because of the subject matter, not because of the system.  The Korean War is a continuation of the WW2 into the Cold War, whereas the superpowers, Communist China, USSR, American and the "Free World" flex their muscles in the Korean peninsular.  A dirty politically- induced war.  I just don't understand why there would be such a war even after the drop of an atomic bomb on earth -- a fact which proves that the threat to use nuclear weapon itself cannot be a means to prevent/ stop war.

Long ago, I had pegged this as a good game with the usual nice VG graphics and the usual Balkoski virtues. I then played Against the Reich, which had a similar system but serious problems, with the inability of units to conduct an offensive along a front.  Turns out this game has the same problem once you go past the initial head-over-heels NK expansion period.  Too bad.

Great Game on Korean War. I like the operation system and the fact that UN political objectives are represetned (the escalation rules are wonderful.) I like ot be able to break down US divisions to better spread out or conentrate them for the decisive punch. I like the portayal of the UN efforts (but including also minor natioanlities air forces would have been great). People have complained about the lack of surprise on the Inchon landing or on the CCF intervention. The problem is that susprises have already been done in 1950...

Just started playing the Advanced Game, if anything, rating likely to increase.  

Low counter density and a fluid game system.  Good operational level system that integrates air power (air support/interdiction), an interesting logistics systems (supply depots) that really forces you to carefully choose your area of concentration and the Global Tension Track.  UN military deployment and level of involvement ratchets up Global Tension, which can lead to Chinese/Russian intervention, even World War 3.  Cool!

I'm enjoying the game so far.  Feel inspired now to read up on some of the history of the war.

An excellent, tense, exciting game, with carefully considered and appropriate mechanisms, and pretty good as history.  There are a few aspects which could use a bit of tweaking through house rules.  One of the best of the VG publications, which counts as high praise. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good game, gives a good insight of the problems on the UN(US) side. While playing the game you have to keep a close eye on polital tensions around the world. The challenge is to win and conquer North-Korea while avoiding ww3.
Chinese intervention will almost always occur, unless advancing UN troops do not cross the 38th paralel. Soviet intervention is harder to trigger.
When you play the game it gets clear very quickly that armored forces were not as important as during ww2. Infantry, Airborne troops and Amphibious assaults combined with Air and Naval superiorty are the key to victory.
The North only has to make sure it doesn't get overrun after the Pusan break-out and must do anything to raise polital tensions. 
Great game to play, can be played in two to three nights.

One of Joe Balkoski's finest designs in my view. Works very well to show the qualitative advantage of the US forces. The first scenario is a tense tactical struggle on the Naktong. The Chinese intervention scenario is also very good and very simple. The campaign game has the usual problem of Korean War simulations: the lack of strategic surprise (Inchon, Chinese intervention) but I like the strategic decisions / escalation system: the Kuomintang, the National Guard or nuclear bombs can all be used. I need to buy a second copy.

Only rule problem is the fact that the UN player can delay playing indefinitely by splitting/recombining his divisions (no fatigue), which should be forbidden.

Good game. It was the first real strategy game I bought and I consider it an excellent starter for anyone who wants to learn to play strategy games.

This game does have its moments.  The challenge is to try to do better historically.

The Korean War to me is like riding a roller coaster, there are big swings in momentum at different points in the game. I liked the way armor was handled as assets, neat. This is an excellent game.

EXCELLENT game! Very intuitive after the first couple of turns. NO rules Qs at all. Plays very smoothly and the players' attention is on the map and units almost all the time.

I've only played two scenarios so far and have thoroughly enjoyed myself. Can't wait to try the CG.

Joe Balkoski's masterpiece and one of my favorite games. The emphasis on supply that is not too complex and an intelligent combat system.
Try this game you won't regret it.

Innovative rules that have been copied since,  but an old-school surfeit of charts and die rolls and a strategic situation that might not be infinitely replayable (I only played once, so..)

Operational level War board game. I missed the opportunity to play this back in the 80's and I tell you I wish I didn't. This game has some very well written, clear and concise rules if not the best by VG, excellent combat system and the game really captures the feel of this war while still managing to be fun and not tedious like most simulations do. Clearly one of my new favorite games.

My first "heavy" wargame. This one is great in many ways. It's a great simulation, both sides will be "the attacker" at various times in the game and the counter density is  low.

I like the topic that is covered. After several plays I think the system has its flaws.

The first game I bought about this conflict.
I've only played it a couple of times and still don't have a real feel for the rules. It reminds me a lot of VG's Vietnam game.
Map and counters are well done.

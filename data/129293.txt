RATING: 4
Very few, albeit important decisions. All the meat of the game is in the initial betting, when you decide who gets which character. After that you are just a spectator in a play taking place over an unpredictable number of rounds. I won't recommend this because the proportion of decision making to spectating is on the poor side. But I must admit that the game has many cool ideas, though.

Okay game.  Supposed to be a game of boasts, but my group never does.  We are all just too meek to be boastful at this game so it really just doesn't find a groove for me or my groups.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Kind of a silly dice game.  One where you spend bidding extra deficiencies on to your characters, only to play them to ruin.  Some good laughs and interesting decisions, but still kind of a downer.  Well-made game--if not quite short, though--and I'm looking forward to more plays.

Rating after 2 plays:  Lightweight and fun game game in two distinct phases: 1 - Recruit Heroes, 2 - Fight your way through a dungeon and try to make the most money, even though you are most certain to die.  

Phase 1: Heroes are combined with weapons and everyone wants to select the hero with the most skill and weapon advantages.  The next play may either choose a different hero or may "steal" a hero already chosen, but only if they add a "boast" to that hero (the boasts are a penalty that degrades the hero's performance, i.e. Hungover, On one leg, While juggling, etc.  This phase plays best when players role-play and talk-up the boasts.  Lots of variation in this phase makes it difficult to determine the best option.

Phase 2:  All heroes enter the dungeon and fight the same creatures drawn from a random deck, rolling simultaneously.  Knowing when and where to use your skills is essential and ultimately comes down to a luck-fest.  The ultimate winner is the player with the most treasure, which you can achieve tactically even if you aren't the strongest or don't last longest in the dungeon.

Nice artwork, lots of bits and well produced.  I'm going to enjoy testing-out different combinations.

RATING: 7.75
Much better than I was expecting. The first game I played of it no one bid on anyone and just took the heroes in the center. The game dragged way too long and it was very apparent that not every hero/weapon combo was created equal. Fortunately we immediately played another game, and then another. The real star of the game, in my opinion, is the player controlled balancing mechanic, and then seeing how accurate it was when mixed with luck. Not a serious game by any stretch, but one that easily fills the void left after Munchkin was sent to the board game gulag.

Bid for a hero, then go down the dungeon and kill monsters until you die. Earn more gold than your competitors and you win. 

Works well as a filler!

RATING: 4
I do not recommend this game with two players.  We made it through 2/3 of the deck in our first game, mostly due to the Sack of Loot having over 50 attack power by the end of the game.  The second game was over much faster, but again I found it was unbalanced with two players.  I'm hoping it gets better with 4 players, as then we will only have one hero going through the gauntlet.

Update: We played a couple more games with 4 players.  The game is definitely better with 4.  The first game was slow as we all learned, the second game was very quick.  This could end up being a good warm up/filler game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Kind of fun, and has potential.  I feel like there's a good game in the box, but it's not the game described by the included rules.  Something like Name-that-Tune where you boast until someone says "fine, fight that monster", and you do.  Like some others said, with the rules-as-written, the decision making is almost all front-loaded.  Still had fun playing the first time, though.

Sadly my children (7 and 5) don't really get the "boasting phase" yet, but they do love to roll the dice and see what combinations of adventurer/weapon come up - can't help feeling that this might be a slightly missed opportunity - they do ask to play it however and despite its limitations I'm happy enough to dungeon trawl along for 15 minutes!

Update: Have been playing with a random boast dealt out on each character for starters so that they get used to the effect of the boasts. Works quite well in two player.

A very silly little game where you bid to put negative status on your opponents characters.  Well why would you want to do that?  Because the characters are purposely not balanced and if a great character gets a great weapon they're gonna have no trouble in the Gauntlet phase.  It's up to you and your friends to add those boasts and knock em down a few pegs.  Silly, lighthearted fun.  Games last about 15 mins, there is almost no player interaction after the boasting round and if you roll poorly you'll lose.  It's not a high brow thinking man's game.  It's a silly Galaxy Trucker, see how long you can survive card game.  A silly distraction.

RATING: 8
Extremely well done filler dungeon crawl. Reverese bid for hero/weapon combos, then see how long you last, and most importantly, how much money you can get. All the fantasy tropes are here, distilled to less than 30 mins, even with up to 6 people.

Dungeon crawl dice game where players bid to handicap themselves in order to get the character they want; then hack-and-slash their way through a gauntlet (see what they did there?) of monsters. Whoever piles up the most treasure wins.

The premise is thin and wears off quickly; there's lots of bits to track and character powers; and while the idea is interesting (you are guaranteed to perish along the way because you're a hubristic dummy) I don't think it's enough to hang its hat on.

I am glad this is a light and fun game! Strikes me as Ghosts and Goblins the card game. You don't expect to live, it can be incredibly hard, and all you want is more points than your friends.

I like that two players have a sacrificial character, that is helpful.

My ONLY change to the rules would be that you have to increase the boasts by adding one more than the previous person did. So the first person could add a boast, the second person would have to add two and then it could only be stolen one more time by adding three boasts - or you could claim it for yourself by putting three boasts on it immediately. I think this would help with the lack of strategy by adding some more consideration to the boasting phase.

And certainly the two play rule has much more strategy, it could be played that way with six players if desired - two characters per player.

I've only played it twice, but it seems quite bad.  I guess the bidding part at the front is interesting, but I'd have to play many times to bid intelligently and the long luckfest that comes after the bidding doesn't leave me interested in doing that.

RATING: 4
The first time I played, I happened to get a fairly strong character / weapon combination that did not get bid up, and it allowed me to walk all over everyone. This was not very fun for any of the people playing. It would take a few plays to get a better idea of how the different characters and weapons work, but I don't feel willing to do so. There are so many other games I'd much rather play.

I really like this game for what it is, if your looking for a deep dungeon crawler this is not it, but for what it is it is fantastic. It plays quickly with no downtime.

Fast and light, but with a few significant decisions early (boasting) and sometimes late (especially in the 2p version).  Boasting is key: if you let someone get something cheap, there's trouble; if you boast too much, there's trouble.

Probably needs a tweak to the character selection phase: maybe one more round once everyone has a character, to give the opportunity to add a boast (returning your "current" character to the central pool).  Once everyone passes, that's it :-)

RATING: 6.5
A fast playing antidote to the over-saturation of the Munchkin-style dungeon crawling experience. Great game to teach newcomers and a great filler for those who like a Munchkin style game but really don't get on with the FU approach of Munchkin. Or simply those who prefer dice. 

Worth a play or two or even a slot in your 'newbies' or 'casual' piles for the days when serious isn't on your mind or when time is short. Easily customised and expanded.

RATING: 5
Players are fantasy characters, boasting in a tavern before running the "Gauntlet" the next morning.  Fun filler, where a number of character classes are dealt out, and paired up with a weapon class.  For example, you may have the "Monk with a Wand", or "Necromancer with a Cleaver", and so on.  Each class of card has a special ability, as well as a defence value or attack dice value.  Players take turns drafting a pairing, which can either be from the centre of the table, or off another player.  You must "boast" to take a pair off another player, making that pair weaker (e.g. "with one hand tied behind my back", or "drunk", etc).  Once everyone has a character class/weapon (with boasts!), the game enters the Gauntlet - basically a deck of encounters each character must face.  You typically roll dice to defeat the encounter and claim gold, and must fend off the counter attack to avoid a wound.  Characters and weapons have a myriad of combinations to help you in the Gauntlet, but eventually they all succumb by taking four wounds.  Most gold wins.  

This is a fun game and certainly comes alive after a play or two.  The first few games will be a bit odd, as there is no metric to measure how powerful the card pairings are.  This means some match ups will dominate in the Gauntlet.  However, a little experience will quickly result in boasts being flung around the table and some careful thought required.  The abilities have been very well thought out, and the game plays very smoothly.  Not sure about the longevity of it, but solid stuff.

Typical of Donald X., the game is very front-end loaded.  The most important decision made during the game (some might say the ONLY decision made during the game) is choosing your character and weapon combo, and which boast you can penalize it with so that it is less desirable to other players.  But have you made it too unattractive?  The rest of the game is a dice roller where you just hang on for the ride and see how long you last.   Would be boring if it wasn't so quick.   Should make a decent filler and has enough to please the RPG crowd in that regard.   The production is disappointing, with some real problems with legibility, colors, and awkward bland tokens.  Far from perfect, but short and sweet and not quite the dreck that it is made out to be.

I spent GenCon2012 demo-ing the new Donlad X game for Indie Boards and Card. This is a light dungeon crawl comparable to Munchkin in accessability. It does not have the backstabby nature of Munchkin, and, as a result, is over long before it wears out its welcome. It is a light and humorous romp through a dungeon that is playable over lunch, as long as the components are adequately sorted.

Not much going on here. Most of the decision making is in the Boasting phase where you choose your hero. The rest of the game is just either taking a hit or killing a monster with hardly any decision making on your part. Fortunately the game plays very fast (our first play was 20 minutes, including rules explanation) so it'll stay in my collection as a very short filler. Great artwork, incidentally. One last thing: the 2-player game is awful: the boasting phase is essentially useless so the game just plays itself.

Gauntlet of Fools just didn't do it for me. Maybe it's more fun for the D&D [thing=1927][/thing] crowd. Players draw cards for their hero and weapon, then draw more random monster cards and hope to defeat them. There's more to it than that, of course, but not much. It's light and silly, so I'm probably being to harsh on it, but I just found it very uninteresting.

The boasting phase, which genuinely is the big attraction, is not only over quickly, but it's just not that cool in reality.  All you're ultimately doing is rebalancing the game if the random deal unbalanced it. If the other players aren't paying enough attention to force that balance on the game at the start, it will play out like any other unbalanced game (which is not fun). And the boasting itself sounds fun on the surface (Ha! I'll fight while hopping on one leg!) but in reality is just taking a token that says you'll fight the whole game at -2 defense, or ignoring low dice rolls, etc.  I don't personally find it fun to choose a powerful character only to hamper him voluntarily, and frankly when I play with my kids, we almost never bother to boast for precisely that reason.  Once you've gone through the work of rebalancing the game, you strap in for the "gauntlet phase", which is turning cards over, every one rolls their dice and decides if they hit. If they did, they get gold, if not, they don't. Next phase -- defense -- you don't even roll, just compare the monster's attack number to your defense and take a hit or don't. The "Gauntlet" is supposed to be "four phases" but phase 1 is turn over the next monster card in the deck and phase 4 is "check to see if you died", both of which take about one second each.

So, boasting phase: not super compelling. Gauntlet phase: not super compelling, and experienced, attentive gamers can blow through it in minutes if they aren't stopping to chug beers and talk smack.

Wow.. this is how i imagine munchkin plays like.. rolling dice and watch what happens..
Tries to be funny, doesn't succeed.
Lots of fiddly tokens don't help the game at all.

If they would've somehow made a game solely about the character picking.. that could have been something.

Actually reminds me a lot of Galaxy Trucker.. first build your ship/hero then roll dice/flip cards and see what happens.

Goofy, fun, and chaotic, but highly luck driven. It's like Munchkin with dice, only it has better artwork, faster playtime, and is genuinely a better game. I like the interesting reverse-auction mechanic whereby you bid by making certain items worse in value.

I was expecting the rating go down with every subsequent play, but it's quite the opposite.

It's basically beer and pretzels game, BUT don't let yourself be mislead by this.  If you play it too light, you might miss some important choices and decisions and the fun will vanish quickly into thin air.

RATING: 3
I initially loved this game, frequently suggesting it as a Munchkin alternative. Unfortunately, this is not a game I bother introducing to people anymore.

The core problem is that it must be played multiple times to understand how to play correctly. After a few runs through the dungeon, players should begin to understand the value of class and weapon combinations revealed at the start of the game.

That's an issue because this is a short, silly, and random game that needs to have instant accessibility. In spite of the humor and replay factor, it keeps falling flat with group after group because the first game doesn't go over well.

RATING: 6
A game that is at cross purposes with itself, both in theme and execution.  The bidding by boasting for handicaps to which your character will voluntarily submit is silly and fun but the rest of the game’s presentation and mechanics lack the light touch of this system.

The bidding is the interesting and interactive part but it does introduce a hefty learning curve, in that as a new player you don’t really have any context to evaluate the relative strength of the combos.  And then you spend 20 minutes resolving the outcome, so you get relatively inefficient feedback on which combos were actually the best.  The game depends on the bid for balance but we only do it once, so the game’s important decisions are already made two minutes in.  This should have been sent back for development and completely inverted.

Well, it does play much faster than Munchkin!  This game pretty much revolves around the character/weapon combo boasting auction.  After that, there are precious few decisions and you are just riding along.  I still plan to give it another try or two, but this one looks to be moving along from my collection pretty quickly.  Who knows, other Vaccarino games have been slow starters for me and I warm up after a few plays so perhaps there is hope.

I wanted to like this game, but it's boring. The boasting element is the most interesting part, and it's over quickly. The rest of the game might be fun if it were funny, but only the boasting is funny; were the monsters more like races in Small World, humorous and brimming with character, and the artwork more silly across the board, it might work.

As it stands it's a luck-based filler with an engaging upfront component, but there's not enough there to hold my interest when compared to other filler options. Post-boasting phase the number of interesting decisions are few and the game is too long for what it is.

So far I have won both times. It all feels obvious to me. Few penalties are taken although I have taken one both times to get the character I want. Nobody really seems to be willing to take a penalty so if you add one in, nobody fights for the character despite taking a very tame penalty. Also, I was picking near or at least. It is all very procedural to me.

Game in a Nutshell: Pick a character, and see how long it lasts against a never ending wall of monsters. Last Man standing wins.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Impressively, there's a ton of different characters from which only a random few are used in any game. I like the concept of selecting a character by "boasting" you could do better with "one arm tied behind your back" or other little modifier. The game never drug on excessively for us and the theme of being a bunch of ego maniac heroes who will all die is fun.

Cons: Lacks decisions after the selection of characters. It's just a matter of rolling dice and seeing when you die. The characters seem to be too closely balanced that by boasting in the beginning, what modifier you took on will likely cause your character to go from perhaps the strongest to the weakest.

Other: I think this is more of an activity than a game and when played in that spirit, I'm sure it will have its fans. I just really wish there would have been a touch more attention to the balance (or imbalance) that it could function as both.

Best Use: A fantasy nerd's drinking game.

RATING: 6
It is a decent game. I enjoy the art and character classes a lot. Just too much resides on luck in the game for my taste though. Some combinations of classes and weapons are so powerful that even taking all the negatives at the start does not really result in a big hit to their viability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a very fun game but is highly group dependent.  The primary issue is that it's a bit fiddly and complex up front for such a light game.  So you need gamers who want a beer and pretzels game.  Or else you need to have people who are willing to play several times without understanding it all.

When it clicks this game is a ton of fun.

5. Cards with unique blocks of text!  I hate reading cards!  And I hate having to remember what they say.

A bit disappointed by this one.  Bought for my brother for Xmas, based on its recommendation as a replacement for Munchkin (a game he still wants to play frustratingly often).  Thing is, Gauntlet's fun and silly and quick, but it doesn't scratch the same itch for those looking for backstabby randomness and chaotic negotiation.  Munchkin's a timehog for how little game there is to it, but this doesn't replace or improve upon it.  Still a funny little filler.

I learned to love this game bit by bit. When you'll perceiving the possibilites of combos and funny combinations, will use the abilities in a better way, and makes the game more competitive.

You spend more time choosing characters (not a very fun step) than going through the dungeons.

Very few decissions to make and most of them are obvious. The game is very, very random. There are class+weapon combos that are quite bad, but any of the other can win. 

I rate it with a 4 because it is very fast (it should be played on less than 30 min).

This is fun! The mechanics lend itself to a great party game. The boasting is the best part and I can see where with a good group of players this could be hilarious! We will be playing this one at our Halloween game day for sure. The game is simple to learn, easy to teach and play. You can play with 2, but I feel it will be so much more fun with more. The boasting provides a new and very funny way to back stab your friends...or is it yourself?!? 

The cardboard components are great quality and the box space does provide for sleeved cards and all parts. But the card quality is very cheap and thin, thank goodness I had a supply of card sleeves on hand before the first game. Card sleeving mandatory!

Thank you Donald X. for bringing us another game that is clever and fresh in mechanics. There is a time and a place for all games. Fillers are definitely needed and one that also doubles as a party filler...even better.

There's not too much to it in a decision-making sense, but what it does do is create an environment where lots of fun can happen. Characters and weapons, all with special abilities, are paired up. The main decision is the game is right here, straight up, choosing which pairing will survive the longest and make the most money. If someone else has already taken the one you want, you can take it from them with a penalty, a boast, that reduces its powers. And so on, until everyone reckons the strong pairs have enough penalties to match the weak ones and everyone's happy with their choice. Then reveal a monster which everyone fights simultaneously, roll dice to see if you kill it, get the gold if you do, then see if you take a wound if it's attack is greater than your strength - simple. Keep going, revealing new monsters until the last hero dies, then whoever has the most gold wins. There's some decisions to make along the way on when to use your special powers (preferably before you die) which can make a big difference, but the even bigger difference is rolling high all the time so that you don't need to use your powers. No matter how well you choose your pairing, it's all to naught if you roll poorly. As such, it's easy to mark down. But if you take the boasting (penalty) section literally, talking your guy up Chuck Norris style, there's laughs to be had. Plus it comes in at great filler length which makes it easy to say let's go again.

RATING: 6
"It's hard to rate this after one play (plus a few solo run-throughs). The bidding is so important, but it's hard to figure out the valuations, and especially the first time you play."

Boasting is really important, not just to balance the game, but also to speed it up (by killing off the heroes faster).

It helps to do a bit of role-playing, since the class/weapon combinations can be humorous, and how they interact with encounters eve more so. 

There is clearly a lot of randomness (in the encounter draw). Fillers are often highly random.

Based on one play: I am definitely not the target market for this game, it plays more like a Munchkin and would be best for your boys. You select a hero and can place a negative abilities on them to make them less desirable as on the next players turn, he can steal your hero or chose one that was not selected. Once everyone has a hero, you flip a monster card and everyone rolls a whole bunch of dice. Kill the monster and you get gold, otherwise you get a wound. Whoever has the most goals when everyone is dead wins. Nothing too it, not even fun.

Would rate higher, but the whole boast mechanic seems to be not much of an impact to the game as it seems to just be ignored by most players.
1 game out of the half a dozen sessions (1-3 plays per session) so far has actually seen people wanting to use the boasts.
Without boasts it becomes a random draw and dice rolling game with the only player decisions coming from decision as to when /if to use character special abilities (some characters / weapon combos don't have them either).

Update: I've played this a few more times and I'm lowering my score to a 7.5. This game is fun as a filler, but its a bit tough to play with beginners because they don't know how to boast appropriately. Gamers aren't that interested because it relies a lot on dice rolls after the initial phase. 

Still very fun for what it is. "Cute" is how its often described.

A fiddly, less interactive take on Magical Athlete.

The only decision to make here is which hero you will play with. The game tries to make it interesting during the hero drafting phase to (a) allow players to steal other opponent's heroes and (b) allow players to add "boasts" that weaken otherwise powerful heroes to apparently balance the game.

After that is mindless, dice-rolling multi-player soltaire.

A very fun beer & pretzels game. First plays are slower as you read through the class/weapon combinations available and try to asses their relative value. I don't for know how long the game will stay fresh and I am afraid that once you know the cards and have enough experience to pick your hero quickly, the game may become boring, at least for gamers. Virtually all thinking is limited to the unique and funny bidding for heroes - the actual walk through the dungeon is almost entirely automatic. It may be enjoyable to see how your hero fares, but there's little game in that.

RATING: 1
Awful, roll a number of dice to see if you hit the monster to get gold; then compare its attack to your defence, loose a hit point if your defence is lower. Die when you have no more hit points.

Really? even for less then 30 minutes, it feels like eternity.

Game was fun and fast.  Depending on which class and weapon you pick there can be a lot of opptions, or little in the encounter phase.  Cards are well done, art work great.  And a lot of comboes if you get the right groupoing of class, and weapon.

Card, Drafting, Combat. A light game, it has a neat premise and the execution is decent, but for some reason all of us really expected the boasting phase to be a bigger part of the game. Once you get into combat, it seemed pretty routine. Granted, it goes fairly quickly.

RATING: 3
close to zero player interaction once the game starts. Thankfully short. The game almost literally just asks you a couple questions at the start of the game and then the rest of the game is playing it out to see if you were right

The game itself is fine, although VERY short.  If the game consisted of simply the second round, I'd think it would be fair or so.  The first round is a auction-type round, and it's just downright silly and might last longer than the actual gameplay.  Donald X, not sure this is a good one.

Each player gets a weapon/card combination (Armorer + Deadly Fists, Ninja + Flaming Sword, etc.) which between them provide 1-2 special abilities, a defense value and a number of attack dice. Cards from the encounter deck are turned over and players simultaneously tackle the challenge, winning gold if they kill a monster and also taking damage if its attack equals or beats their defense value.

The interesting part is in how those combinations are chosen. They're taken in turn order, but (a la Mammut) you can take a hero already chosen if you add one or more of the "boasts" ("My ninja could make it through the gauntlet with one hand tied behind his back"), effectively a handicap.

It does play quickly, especially with boasts dragging the heroes down, but the auction/boasting phase is very difficult because it's so situational. The luck of the encounter deck is substantial -- sometimes investment in a character with high defense doesn't pay off because the monsters are so powerful that [i]everyone[/i] dies.

There is less strategy than I had hoped, so the hunt for a perfect 5+ player filler continues.

There was very little bragging in my game, though I think a braggart did win, so maybe there should have been more.  It was fun, and it played quickly, but I do wish there was a little more to it.

RATING: 4.5
[Kickstarter 2012 edition] {Dungeon; dice-rolling, card-drafting; optimal 6p}  This is a decent filler when we are waiting for all players to start the party.  The major problem is that once the heroes are assigned, the game become too auto-pilot without any player interaction at all.

This game is quite fun, but thematically strange - why the winner is the one with the most gold when the whole party died?  What's the point of having most gold if one dies.

The major flaw of this game is LOW replayability.  It becomes boring after few games.

RATING: 7
Funny game of bidding for the best hero, then trying to stay alive and gather as much gold as possible. The 'bidding' takes the form of 'boasts' that handicap the character in various ways. That plus the variety of encounters obscures how valuable each hero will actually wind up being. Good laughs and good fun.

RATING: 7.5
Played the demo at Gen Con.  It is just the right length of game for what it is.  I would have liked to see it with 6 players instead of 4.  We definitely played conservative and didn't boast enough imo. Would be interesting to see what happens if you were required to take a boast when you first bid on your character. However if that didn't work out well the Gauntlet doesn't last all that long, and there's plenty of replayability that you can just play it again right away.  Definitely a lighter game, and I think I'm going to enjoy getting my Kickstarter copy!

Cute, fast, extremely random game. You draw a random deck of characters with a random set of weapons, then gamble with the other players to see who gets to play what. (If you do this right, the good characters get nerfed badly enough that everyone's on an even playing field.) Then you randomly fight monsters, roll dice, and see how many you can kill before you die.

Very fast game with fairly simple mechanics, which can be lots of fun if you're with a group who doesn't mind a ton of randomness.

Gauntlet of Fools is one of those casual fun games I love to break out when I want to get silly with friends. It's swingy, sometimes things get stacked in one players favor, or the luck of the cards goes one way, but that itsn't a regular occurance. It's random, fun and has fantastic replay value.

I played one game of this as a two-player game, and with just two players it's pretty pointless. I'm hoping with more players it's better, because it was much less entertaining than I'd hoped. 

UPDATE: Played it with five players, it's not any more entertaining to me. There seems to be very little "boasting" in the games I played by anyone.

Bought this on a whim at the game store when I saw it was designed by Donald X. For me, it's basically if Munchkin had more dice, went faster, and was more fun. I love that it plays pretty quickly, and it would make a good in-between game if not for the crazy amount of tokens. Usually good for a quick playthrough or two as a palette cleanser, I find. Would be more fun with a little more player-to-player interaction during the game, but fun anyway.

When I was still waiting for my Kickstarter version of the game to arrive, some review videos of it made me regret backing the project. So I started my first game expecting disappointment. But...disappointed never kicked in! Gauntlet Of Fools offers simple gameplay and is very luck dependent, but is really fun to prove that your decision to select a particular hero/weapon was a sound one. No matter how much boasting was actually done in the first part of the game. A nice filler of a game that can easily induce some cries of disbelieve or astonishment in the second part of the game. Especially by eliminated players who are still in the race to win. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Funny game and nice concept! I could not see myself playing this that many times though. As players score points pretty much the same pace, it can be frustrating for the players dropping out early. Also, it looks that after a while, everybody can see who will be winning the game. The excitement curve towards the end of the game seems to be dropping, which is not optimal I think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Interesting in theory, but the game is heavily skewed against you ever actually using any boasts. It's more than likely that you'll never need to, as most heroes are usually pretty buff, and you might only want to nerf the occasional overpowered hero (Zealot with Death Fingers. Yeah.)

I think this game got a bad rep.  It's not as bad as it looks, or as you'd think it would be, or as Vassel made it sound.  The boasting phase really isn't that hard to figure out, and if you get rocked the first time, just play it again.  The game only takes 15 minutes.

In some ways the boasting phase feels like it's unnecessary, just a way for players to self-balance, but there is some strategy and fun to the process of it.  Trying to pawn off combo's you don't want so you can get the one you do want.

I really enjoy it with the 2-player variant where you get two hero's.  Gives you more decisions and strategy for both the boasting phase and the actual gameplay as you cycle between your two hero's.

A fun little filler with some decisions to make.

RATING: 5
Simple riff on the framework with tons of small variants idea that Donald X. Vaccarino has run with.  There's an odd disconnect between theme and mechanics here.  Sure, the idea is that these are foolhardy adventurers, but going until you die is kind of ridiculous.  For this kind of theme to work, I think the game has to be slightly more take-that.  The bragging system isn't particularly well-implemented either.  The auction for the characters tends to be poorly valued unless everybody knows the game well.  And honestly, the game's not really interesting enough to play more than once or maybe twice.  Just about the time you get good enough to correctly value the characters and weapons, you're just as likely to put it away, never to be touched again.

I guess this is probably my favorite of the Donald X games where you grab a bunch of mechanics from a hodgepodge, though that's damning with faint praise.  At least it has some bows to theme, even if they are somewhat unintuitive.

Crazy betting game, in a good way. Not for serious gamers, but for fun. Ok filler.

Players take turns to choose characters, they can take character from other player if they also take some minuses (boast) and once all have one character, the game starts. Usually a monster appears, players fight it and some survive. The player who loots most money, wins the game.

There was very little I liked about this game, though I'm not much of a dice game fan and also didn't care for the theme, so take that for what it's worth.

I had a hero with 3 attack dice, and 3 of the 5 monsters I survived were literally impossible for me to kill (had defense values greater than 18). If I'd known the deck better, I might have expected that - but why would you even include heroes that have zero chance against that many monsters? Maybe I just got unlucky, but the rest of the game wasn't compelling enough for me to ever want to give it a second chance.

Doesn't get played much but it's still a fun filler and, as someone who generally dislikes dice games, this one gets a thumbs up from me... mostly because most of the strategy comes from the hero-bidding phase.  After everyone's won a hero, running the gauntlet via dice rolling introduces just enough randomness to keep things interesting.

RATING: 2
This is light as all heck! The premise is fun, but the implementation severely lacking. I found the backwards style bidding to be fun, but only doing that once and then rolling dice the rest of the way was a big letdown.

I would find it more fun if you recruited a party of adventurers in a succession of auctions, or at the very least played a couple of rounds and added up your final score. As it stands now, I'll be happy to never play it again.

This is one of those cases when you should research before buying a game! I was taken by the description on the box (and by the author), but as soon as I opened it and read the rules I realized my mistake.
The game is boring, random and far from fun. Even as a filler with friends, I am not sure that this will ever work. It just leaves a bad taste in your mouth after each play. Looking forward to get rid of it, because it's not worth of the space it occupies on the shelf.

Great Setting, great Minis, but i've seen no customisation Options, and it would be a great thing, tuning my Warjacks with Suff i've smashed out of the Enemy ones for Campain Games. 

Alltrough, the Heavy Warjack Models are looking very customizeable - consisting out of 6 to 8 parts.

TABLETOP MINIATURE WARGAME (Obsolete)

Simple game mechanics, yet allow for good tactical play and combo-abilities. Fast & Furious: a game doesn't take long to play, without lengthy down times. The miniatures are beautiful and the artwork on the books is excellent. The factions are well balanced and more options have been added since the introduction of Hordes.

If I had years 15-25 back, this is what I'd play. Slick rules, excellent production and great theme. 

Too bad it costs infinite money and time.

Got a bit of money together and recently bought the starter - the game has bloated a lot, in rules and expense. Might as well be GW now.

This is the best set of fantasy mini rules I've yet played. It's not classic Tolkien elves vs. orcs -- it's Arcanum-style fantasy/age-of-steam crossover. The rules are great: clean but allowing for lots of creativity (particularly with the warjacks' power moves such as throws and slams). Great stuff. Highly recommended.

I love the balance of the sides of and the brutal battles.  There are some subtle, yet powerful mechanics that add a great tactical depth to the game.  Primarily the use of focus points to do special actions, heal, etc...  Great miniatures game if you can deal with the steampunk theme.

I like this game more every time I play it. The use of Focus points is brilliant, and I like the 'checkmate' aspect of the warcasters.  I've recently had to reduce this game from a 10 to a 9 because of the move away from focusing on Jacks and Casters, but I hear that will soon be rectified.

Wonderful skirmish tabletop game and wonderful miniatures combined with good fluff.

It might be a bit complicate for beginners as every miniature has its own special rules but I like this feature. It feeld like a good miniature game combined with the wily combination of effects like in Magic the Gathering.

Also good is that a starter box is enough for many interesting plays.

RATING: 7
I like the theme, the art, the mini's the gameplay, and the comraderie of playing, but for some reason, I just can't motivate to play this one much.  I think I would rather do other things with my gaming time than this, or really any miniatures for that matter (ex. Blood Bowl).  Really bad campaign system, and the rules and mini's don't really allow for, nor facilitate, any mods, which is always a fun part of mini games.  At least non functional mods.  So, there you go. A great game, but I would rather play ASL, or Wizard, or some such nonsense at the moment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An enjoyable skirmish level miniatures game. The minis are fantastic and fun to paint and more keep coming out as the game expands (along with more book supplements of course). Balance may be a slight issue when it comes to Warcaster feats.

Update: Downgrading a bit now that time has passed and new minis, new books, reprinted books and everything else has turned this into a costly endeavor.

Update: Hadn't played in years so I gifted my collection to a friend who started playing.

Warmachine is a steam-punk era miniatures game, using steam-powered warjacks (robots, sorta), powerful spellcasters, and infantry that have abilities and powers of their own. The basic mechanic is pretty simple - roll 2d6, add a stat and modifiers, and try to beat your target model's stat.

Warmachine seems fun, and the models are (mostly) very nice. I have some concerns about its replayability in the long-term, but I currenly feel that I can reccomend it to minis gamers who don't demand total realism, and like the combination of high-tech themes in a low-tech fantasy world.

Simply put, my favorite pure miniatures game.  A mix of strategy and luck that suits my tastes, fantastic minis, great flavor, and you don't need 150 figs a side to play.  The game has bloated, though, through the years and I find that I have to prepare for several days before playing - and that often leaves this to the side.  At this point, it's been years since I've played a game.

One of the best mini games on the market.  It's well supported, with plenty of fluff and new minis coming out constantly to make playing the game a different every time.  The only part I don't like is that it is not alternating movement phases, like the original Warzone minigame was.

A miniatures game combining the better aspects of miniature gaming and CCG's. Warmachine's fast and furious gameplay coupled with the potential of combining spells with the inherent abilities of the units/jacks make this a winner. KL.

My new addiction. A miniatures wargame that is beautifully well balanced. It has rich diversity in its units and warjacks without any being overpowered. When you play against different factions, the different units become more or less useful. The focus point allocation system makes the battles tense and dynamic. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I believe this game is superior to the various editions of Warhammer 40,000. For me, the primary attractions are: the tighter rules set; and the lesser number of dice needed for a game; the ability to play a game with smaller armies (thus a smaller time/money investment).

Armies: Khador
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In my opinion, as a former player of this and other miniature games, Warmachine makes a good second runner to Warhammer 40k/Fantasy. Whether through a diminished audience, or through the lack of customization in comparision to 40k/Fantasy, I just don't find the game as compelling. There's no emphasis on design and background, as there is for Warhammer, and there's no encouragement to go out and build your own scenery. Or it could simply be that Warhammer has about 30 years on this game. Although I like some of its combat mechanics, I find the limited strategic options (of how to set up your army) and the stilted metagame (there are very few viable army builds that are effective for each faction) make this a sub-par miniature game.

A very nice miniatures wargame.  Of course, sometimes that's like saying a very nice sunburn.  Miniatures wargames appeal to me primarily from the angle of painting, not playing.  The rules are always awkward, the playing moreso.  The complexity level is too high for what you get.  And the game play is never inspiring or interesting - overly detailed and nitpicking.  These games only really work when played by fanboys willing to forgive their failings.

RATING: 8
One of the best miniature game I've ever played- if only I had the patience for painting and assembly.  Simple, uncluttered rules free of the doggerel that plagues many such games resulting in a fast, action-oriented game that has myriad combinations, tactics, and strategies to discover.  The game world is unique and interesting and every battle plays out like an epic struggle.  This is a great introductory miniatures game but it provides ample depth for the veteran to explore.  Some of the miniatures could be a little better and the "macho" posturing evident in some of the language used in the books is tiresome.  I think overall this is going to be one of the classic miniatures games in the long run- it's definitely unseated Game$ Work$hop in my area.

Now this is how a miniature game should work. I'm still winning tournament games with my "no expansion model"-lists. Makes one a lot more interested to buy new miniatures when one knows they'll last through the next rules update. Excellent support from the publisher.

Second edition is out now and I've not been to a tournament in a while which makes my previous comment about winning a bit out of date.

A good tabletop wargame. An emphasis on ability combos and precise placement. The rules are sensible and unambiguous, and it requires relatively few models to play.

As a downside: I hate the lack of per-model customization. I also feel like the ability combos overshadow the actual tabletop miniatures.

Refresing change from something like 40k. Rules are well written, play is fast and brutal. Warjacks seem to take a pounding sometimes and keep on swinging. Also relatively cheap to start into - many hours of fun just with the models in the starter sets.

As a newcomer to tabletop gaming, I don't think I could have found a more appropriate game with which to start. A ruleset that's simple to learn and play, yet nuanced enough to provide ample room for strategy; figures that are cast in metal (as they should be!) and wonderfully detailed; a price that's easy enough on the wallet.

RATING: 9
A great skimmish-scale mini's game that has soaked enormous amounts of what little spare time I seem to have these days. The jacks and creatures seem to appeal to a wide band of our group which is notorious for disjointed interests. A rare occurance that most everyone is into a single game theme. Even the staunch anti-mini zealots have fallen for the game. Now if I could just finish painting and stop buying minis...

Spawned the enormously popular Whitey Snakebitey competition.

I really can't understand the hype behind this game, I can see the argument that it's a better game than warhammer 40000 but there are many better miniatures games than this.  Gameplay seems to consist of forming CCG like combos between your units and trying to get your combos off while avoiding your opponents. Privateer press do make nice miniatures and rulebooks, and i think this accounts for their success more than the quality of the game.
New remixed edition consolidated the rules but left out the army lists, and failed to really address some of the biggest imbalances in under/overpowered units.

Buying the only unit left that I actually liked, that would work with my faction (boomhowlers) only to find they are an overpointed heap of junk was the final straw, sold up and moved on...

RATING: 4
Just let me take my foot out of my mouth over my previous 4 rating.  The GenCon demo people were the thing that sucked, not the game.  Now that I've witnessed and then played a few games, I can see how much fun a game with lethal minis can be.  Every single unit could absolutely destroy any other unit if they had a perfect situation.  That makes it actual strategy to manipulate the fight so you get all the overpowering moments.  (The mass freeze feat is still overpowered though.  Stupid Russians.)

Update 8-4:  Man, does this game ever peak bright and fast.  Basically, this game does exactly what it sets out to do.  Extremely balanced high with outragously powerful combos and units.  Turns out, that really isn't any fun at all after a while.  Once the newness has worn off and the game has been played a lot, everyone knows (or reads on the internet) all the mega combos and powerful tricks.  So either you don't have fun because you are playing with your own developed list and tactics and your opponent is playing with a world champion undefeated cheese list, or you don't have fun because you are playing a cheese list you got off the internet with a strategy you got off the internet and you aren't really playing a game at all any more.

RATING: 6.5
Probably the best skirmish game that I've played or seen played (and I've seen a lot). 

9 only because I don't like how extreme (good or bad) dice rolls work in skirmish games - one extreme good or bad roll can decide winner or looser. 

edit: after some time, I got rid of my army. The problem that I didn't originally see with this game, is that it's actually Magic the Gathering with miniatures. Which is something that REALLY annoys me. Privateer Press makes regulary new rulebooks, and each time new units are overpowered compared to the old ones. Also MKII rule set practiaclly makes you "abandon" your old miniatures in order to buy new ones, because everything that was good is now bad and vice-versa. This is calssic concept of any CCG game, but with miniatures you need to invest a lot of money AND a lot of time to paint your miniatures.

For these reasons, my rating of 9 would drop to 5 - it is still better than Magic: the Gathering, but it is not what I hoped it was going to be.

edit 2: after a long while, we started playing warma/hordes again. MK2 seems a bit better than 1st edition. And new miniatures are not released as fast as they used to, which is good money-wise. I'll increase rating to 6.5

I've played this game to the exclusion of everything else for about four months and I still love it.  If you're looking for a miniatures game, this is a good one to buy into -- good ruleset, nice miniatures, and a reasonable buy-in.  The game generally favors aggressive techniques, but between the four strongly themed factions and their wide variety of unit types, you can probably find a strategy suited to you.  Power creep, a plague on many miniatures games, is minimal because everything is balanced against the initial army list.  An army composed solely of first-wave units will stay competitive.

A nice side benefit is that for a miniatures game, this one has a pretty low buy-in.  You can get started for $40 and put together a competitive army for about $120.  You're generally not going to have a ton of models either since it's more of a skirmish game, which means less painting downtime.

Great game, for both the ruleset and the company's policies.

UPDATE: Been playing this game for over five years now, and still going strong.  It's a classic.

This started as a skirmish game, but has been growing into a game of larger battles.  Still, there's a much smaller investment required when compared to the Games Workshop Warhammer games, even if you play the larger battles.

I've got a Khador skirmish force painted, but haven't played in a while.  One problem that I have with the game isn't with the game itself, but with the models.  The company prides itself on doing only metal models, and the result is that you have to do a lot of pinning to get the models to stay together, especially with the more recent sculpts.  I have no interest in doing that much pinning, so I haven't expanded my collection beyond the small skirmish force I started with.

Another problem with the miniatures, which may or may not be part of the group at my FLGS back in California, is that more Warmachine players seem to be willing to play with unpainted armies than other miniature games I've played.  I don't mind playing with partially painted armies when people are working towards finishing their force, but part of playing a miniatures game is seeing the armies on the table fully painted.  Otherwise, why not just play a good tactical boardgame?

The minis are beautiful, the gameplay is simple, elegant, and allows for a lot of options in strategy. That said, it's a game of special rules and abilities, and can get overly complex when introducing the new releases into your game.

It feels a bit like Magic: The Gathering, in that you're looking for combinations and synergies to affect, and enhance your strategy.

The dice can be your best friend or worst enemy, but such are the chances one takes on the battlefield, and there are mechanics to decrease the luck, but sometimes the best planned strategy can fail. A great game I recommend to all the mini gamers out there. Great sculpts, great rules, and a ton of support from Privateer made this one my favorite of all time.

I enjoy the modeling the most, and PP minis are made for painter's and modeler's. As usual with a minis game, it requires a bit of an investment to have a number of options in strategy. With constant new releases it can get expensive fast.

I played the hell out of this game, but with constant new releases, and the sheer amount I played and ran events for this system, I got kind of bored. Mk2 has renewed my interest, and it's an even better game than MK1. A major improvement, and even tighter rules.

MK2 is a much better, more balanced, and FUN game. Warjacks are now much more durable, and there's been a lot of balancing issues solved. Now is the time to get into Warmachine if you've been on the fence about it.

The only reason this is highly rated on boardgamegeek is because Privateer Press saw a chance for some free advertising and had their goons post high ratings. Smooth move, but this game stinks in everyway. A simple minded steroid fest of going caster hunting. Maybe the expansions improved it? Doubtful.

I have my problems with GW but a turn of Gorkamorka is better than this dreck.

By the way, most games I've played and rated lie in the 8-10 range. I just really hate this game. Plus the new miniatures don't look like their predecessors. In ten years it will join the XFL in the ranks of "What were they thinking?"

The system tracks damage and deals with effects in a fashion that's just detailed enough to be really interesting... but it's still a minis game, with measurement and painting and all that.

RATING: 4
Warmachine is special-rules hell.  I do not like overemphasis on special abilities.  The models are nice (maybe a bit too over the top, but not as extreme as Confrontation), I even placed in a local painting contest with my Menoth.  The rules are pretty good, and I like the 'Jack grappling and stuff, but all the special rules just ruin the fun-factor for me.

2016-01-24 - I like Warmachine quite a bit, maybe more than a "6".  However, the collectability [b]AND[/b] having to paint the miniatures means this just does not, and probably won't ever, see a lot of table time.  If I was independently wealthy and could purchase an entire collection of painted miniatures, I could see playing this more.

The miniatures game I've played the most over the last few years.  Excellent game that distinguishes itself from other offerings on the market by concentrating on aggressive play and exceptionally powerful units.  (this isn't a game of cannon fodder)  Oh, and I love the miniatures...

Update: lowered the rating as I have not been pleased with recent changes in the direction of the game (tournament scenarios, Superiority expansion, etc.).

RATING: 7
Have a cryx and Cygnar starter and, after one play, a buddy went and got a Hordes army (Circle) and menoth starter ! out of the box is a decent game, very deep, lots of combos - its sort of Mtg minis game !
Lovely minis to paint too and such a great world !
Update: Does this game attract rules lawyers ? I think so.
UPdate (3/5/08) OK, have played thi sintermittently as I really WANT to like it. Yesterday I had a game and I enjoyed it; I made good choices, my rolling was pretty good. I still lost but I actually want to play again.

A pretty good game that is heavy on background.  The point totals allow easy entry into the miniature game.  Typically, you can play a basic game for about $40 plus the rule book.  I also like the stat cards that come with the figures - no need for in depth charts and detailed "lists" with everything in your army.  The game play is pretty smooth and flows fairly quickly at the lower point levels (~750).

Warmachine is one of the best sets of fantasy miniatures rules available. With quick play times and decent depth, as well as powerful-yet-balanced special characters, you can't go wrong.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is what a mini's game should be fast, aggressive and deep. The game is very character centric. This and its sister game Hordes give the over game 10 factions(Including Mercs) the game tries to achieve balance through having both side with horribly broken abilities. It seems to work over all. The main drawback of the system though is it has become more infantry then war machine centric. I have seen players field only infantry to great effect while those who are heavy on the machine do not fair as well.

Great gaming proposal at his time and alternative to other wargames, feel like it has its flaws improved with MK2, but i rather the risk management from hordes than the resource management of Warhamchine.

There are just so many interesting decisions required in this game.

This is just so much more of a real GAME than any other table top game on the market in terms of offering a balanced and mentally interesting experience, as opposed to others which are really more HOBBIES. 

My only real complaint is just how complicated some of the abilities become when they interact and some minor rules which seem incredibly unrealistic (most in regards to AOE).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An aggressive (i.e. fast, if there are few models) game where synergy is important. I like the overall feeling of an action-packed walk in the woods a lot more than conventional battles.

However, I've decided I don't like painting at all, and I've grown averse to the game as well. It's unforgiving - if you miss a tiny part of the protocol, you're toast - and that doesn't combine well with the fickle dice and imprecise measurements.

Good game, light years ahead of Warhammer 40,000: Rouge Trader.  I'd play it more if the models weren't so stupidly super-masculine: when shoulder pads are bigger than the rest of the model's body, it is absurd.  Also, its quite an expensive game system to obtain pieces for.  I use cardboard cut outs mounted on wooden bases, but everyone in our local group is too $nobby to play against that.

As far as I'm concerned, this is the better edition of the game, as long as you limit yourself to models up to, say, Apotheosis.  Cool models.  4 interesting factions.  The rules are manageable, and only broken if you actively seek to break the game.  If you chose models and factions purely based on "coolness" the game was a blast.  "Play like you've got a pair" and "full metal fantasy."  Sadly, those days are long gone.  I'd rate the current system a 3 or possibly a 4.

This was once a great game that has become unbalanced due to ridiculous power creep -- if you were an oldschool player, nearly every model you own is likely obsolete. However, if you have hundreds of dollars to burn by purchasing every new figure release (especially since they gradually raised prices through the roof), then I'm sure you will enjoy this game.

RATING: 1
This game really has just become a platform form people who don't like GW games to detest GW games from.  Really, the game is not that good.

The jacks walk forward and smack each other until one falls apart, while the rest of your army guns for the enemy 'caster'  The non-jack infantry are simply terrible.  None of them have almost any chance of more than annoying a jack.

Every game I've either played or seen has just turned into one of two things: either my blob of jacks vs your blob of jacks, or gunning for the enemy caster, who grants basically an auto-win to the enemy if you take him out.

And I have to say, I think the models are horrible.  GW models, in my opinion, are much better looking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
 The best mini game I've ever played. The excellent design, the not-so-heavy mechanics with a lot of depth, the four faction, each with its own gameplay, the way your Warcaster is the center of your force, and how the choice of a different warcaster can change the whole gameplay of your army... Makes up for a wonderful game ! The only downside is that each new expansion since Apotheosis (which was the peak of the game, IMHO) seems to hamper the original strong points of the game... Have somehow given up on it.

This has rapidly become my favorite table top miniature game. I think the three things that I like the most about the game and that provide the most attraction, figures aside, is that the rules flow very smoothly, that the big figures wield a lot of power and yet the game doesn't devolve into slug fests just between the big guys, and related to that point even your grunt units have cool abilities. I'm never "filling out my army list" with chaff in Warmachine; everyone is usefull.

I was lied to when I bought this game. They told me that it was cheaper than GW. I buy the introductory boxed set and I am not in. Because if I want to compete I have to stay with the latest releases, which means more money and models. Warmachine players are actually spending more on their hobby than GW gamers in some cases. I sold off my small non-competitive army for a loss and took the valuable lesson. I thought that the game itself was for wrestling enthusiasts with deep slogans like "Play Like You got a pair!" I prefer to play like I've got a brain. I prefer the higher strategy and expert crafting of German Board games. I don't think that this game belongs anywhere near the top of these rankings. Esspecially when the only pictures I see are Privateer Press website pictures. Instead of seeing a 13 year old kid's unpainted, paint-globbed army, which is the reality of this game, I see pictures from the website. That sort of free advertising ploy is in bad taste. I love alot more games than I don't love. But this one I severely dislike.

Good miniatures game, where you must combine your abilities to take your opponent by suprise. Nastier than most other miniature games I've played, so learning curve is quite rough. However, knowing your opponent and yourself certainly pays well here. So near perfect game for people who like to read a lot and plan ahead before actual game. I prefer Warmachine slightly over Hordes, although there are only minor differences in actual gameplay.

I'm not quite sure what some people see in this game.  It's not bad, but I find it to be slower, less interesting, and more 'gimmicky' than similar games, like Warhammer.

Victory in this game is far more likely to be from special abilities, combos, and tricks.  That does have some appeal, but it means that in order to win, you have to memorize virtually every model in the game, which is incredibly tedious.

Okay, I'm excited about the game again, going back up to a 9!

After 4 years and literally hundreds of plays, my ardor is finally cooling a bit for this game.  The basic rules set is very elegant, but the special rules for all the models are starting to make my head hurt.  I'm hoping for a Warmachine 2.0, where they do some simplification work.  

Difficult line for them to walk, as they promised never to make models obsolete.  Yet, to make every new model worth purchasing, they have to do something different for each.

After two years, I'm keeping my rating.  This game still rocks!

After one year, I'm upgrading my rating.  I just can't get enough of this game!

Each unit in an army serves a somewhat different purpose.  Atmosphere is great-I can visualize these incredible battles.  Resource allocation function by using warrior-mages called warcasters makes this unique.  Has a twin game called HORDES.

If I was going to get into a miniature based wargame it would be this one. You only need 1 box of figures (£20), it plays quickly, is fun, and you get to beat each other with mecha-warbots.

Great premise, the background could use some more development but I greatly enjoy. The pieces are very well made and I like that all of them are metal. Also I like how they develop new pieces and play test them against their original line of pieces so that none of their new items are broken and nothing ever becomes obsolete. Also I love that you don't need a ton of pieces, like 30 , to make a decent sized army.

While not technically a board game I have to say I love this game. It's quick, easy and interesting. The pieces are some of the nicest I've seen in miniatures gaming. It's also one of the cheapest games of it's type as far as buying enough miniatures to have a playable army. I really like how the units have cards that you use (with a plastic cover and a dry erase marker) to keep track of everything. If the miniatures came pre-painted (and looked really good) I'd give this a 10 because now that I'm older I don't have time to assemble and paint everything and i hate playing with unpainted minis.

Revised rating 9 (2006) down to 8 (2011).

"Skirmish" level wargame that has become more and more epic with each expansion.

If you have the means and the desire to paint, this game pretty much has it all.  It's expensive and takes a lot of time and devotion, but every aspect of it is highly rewarding.  The icing on top is the thriving community and the support from the company.  You won't be disappointed.

RATING: 9
The only real reason I docked this game a point is because painting is a rather expensive and time consuming aspect, and disappointing when you suck at it like I do.

But damn is this a fine game.  Elegant rules, but with a dash of complexity to not make it simple (ie, all the special maneuvers), figures that you just want to play with, great flavor, great quality, etc etc etc.  Not even that expensive, either.

Now if only I could paint straight...

 These games IMHO are the best fantasy miniature games out there. They aren't perfect--metal models are expensive and I wish there were more factions--but they present a deeper challenge than anything else out there without being overly complex like some historical miniature rulesets.
  I compare Warmachine to Warhammer since I have been playing Warhammer for several years, but it is really more like Magic the Gathering. Like Magic the basic rules are very simple but the richness and flavor comes from learning how different models, spells, and tactics work in combination with one another and discovering and then executing them against your opponent.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Really no interest in playing this game again.  I didn't see anything that really set it apart for any other number of minatures games.  It seemed expensive and tedious to play.  I could be convinced to try it again but certainly won't be requesting or going out of my way to do so.

Don't let this high rating fool you. I am not a miniatures game fan. Actually, until this game I've generally disliked miniatures games. But this one just nails it.

Simple, elegant, brutal. Great rules system and incredibly thematic. Plus, being an artist, I really enjoy the hobby side of the game, too (modeling, painting, etc.)

Had years of fun with this game and probably will again, but I am taking a hiatus from it for now. Seems like it just comes down to the same combos over and over and over again. Maybe some of the fun will be recaptured with storied scenarios with set troop choices.

Simply the funnest wargame to play, bar none.  I highly recommend catching a Warmachine game rep or veteran gamer to show you some tactics up front; it will really make your initial games more enjoyable.

Probably the best skirmish rules I have played to date.  Rules encourage aggressive gameplay discourage turtling.  Great fluff, very chess-like at times.

I have a nicely painted Menoth starter box, and extra heavy jack from first book for trade, as well as Large group of Cryx

Nice models, but repeated playings burned me out. Each unit/caster/solo is a one-trick pony, with the only game strategy being when to unleash each trick. Certainly more interesting (and a much better rules set)than 40K if you're thinking of getting into this sort of gaming.

Warmachine's philosophy in the minature game landscape is a gutpunch. While other games of a similar format may take a long amount of time Warmachine is fairly fast in play speed. The only negatives that come to mind is that the game is very much  a power gamers paradise and  competitive to the Nth degree. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing it can definitely make casual players frustrated. The learning curve is steep for this game but rules are clearly thought out and for the most part obvious.

Best miniature game out there for the size range of the figures. I still like Epic better, but Warmachine is better than any of its competition.

Small squad combat miniature game. Games can vary greatly by just changing a few characters/units. Keeps the game fairly fresh. Very super-powered character driven. 

Downside. In smaller games not many dice are rolled...not enough for the odds to start kicking in. So the luck can really be swingy if there aren't enough models on the table. 

Great models to paint.

About as perfect as a minis wargame can get. Fun, great models, a variety of game formats so you can play hour long scraps or five hour long mega-battles.

I have the Cygnar and Protectorate of Menoth battle boxes and both of the current rulebooks. Now it's time to paint! Iam really looking forward to playing my first noncollectible miniature wargame. This looks sweet.

Best tabletop i ever played. Smooth rules. No best and only power gaming configs. Good minis. You don't need hundreds of them to make it work. 4 kinds of minis, solos, infantry, Jacks(Mechs) and Caster(like the king in check). Not much paperwork to keep track of damage. Some kind of energy-economic via the Caster, gives another depth to the game. Favors the aggressor. No fiddling with ranges, ...ah let me see i can shoot 10" you can shoot 9" and you are 11.5" away from me, when i move 2" i can shoot u but u can't shoot me, ok, or no wait, have to measure distance from that unit first....

The models themselves are detailed and fun to paint, and the allure of squad based war gaming is cool, but the game itself has always struck me as "meh"

As more of an analytical boardgamer, I must admit that this game style is one I don't care for like I did 20 years ago.  (Trying to represent n-dimensional interactions by a fixed BPV doesn't work, Munchkins).  Still if a referee designs both sides in a scenario (and not play the players maximization game) it can be something different and fun. Furthermore this game outdoes others in this category because it keeps the rules streamlined enough so that tactics is about the battlefield and not finding the tricks in the rullebook. Time will show if this should be attributed to the newness of the game or intent by the designers. As tournaments tend to be the 'build and bring your best (i.e. munchkin) army' type, I suspect the former.  But I'm going to be fair and rate it by what I can do with it so far.

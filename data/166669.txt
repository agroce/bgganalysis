GAME: San Juan (second edition)
RANK: 283
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I loved how the cards could be used for multiple things (currency, buildings, production), and I adore variable phase selection (ala Puerto Rico, Glory to Rome). The theme isn't bad. The downside here mostly comes in the form of the end game; there are so few ways of ending the game, that you're options for winning strategies are somewhat narrow. Hands down best at 4p. Big positive that the new edition includes the expansion buildings (otherwise it would slip below 6).

RATING: 7

LIKE: A light/medium card game, but each card has multiple uses blended with some interesting strategy. Slight predictabilty of the market and knowing the end-game cards adds strategy.
DISLIKE: A tad light on interaction, so it lacks some tension... until the end turns, where every action counts.

OVERALL: It's an older game, but the expansion/reprint to the original does add some welcome variation, especially with point cards. A good couples and gateway game, and even more interesting when everyone knows the cards.

RATING: 8
The 2nd edition of San Juan is still the same game as the 1st edition, i.e., a great streamlined game that is easy to teach and plays relatively fast. The best thing about San Juan is that every turn you face many tough decisions since you usually want to hold on to all the cards but you cannot, and thus you must make a decision, usually a painful one. This is what I appreciate the most about a board game, meaningful decisions.

The biggest problem of the original game is fixed in this new edition, which is the longevity. So the game is fine itself but since it is so good that you play it a lot, there comes a point when you would like to see more variance from game to game. 2nd edition adds the cards from the original expansion which is just what it takes to make San Juan a legend. Fun that lasts for years.

The only thing that keeps me from rating San Juan higher is the monodimensional decision tree. It is a fine line between too linear and overly complex decision making. Nevertheless, San Juan has a lot to offer.

RATING: 7.4
From Secret Santa 2016. 

A lighter, quicker take on Puerto Rico--similar theme but quite different gameplay, and much improved in its second edition (which corrected the balance of a few different cards which were potentially problematic in the first edition).

Abstract:
The card game version of the economic board game Puerto Rico. Players collect cards to grow crops (goods for trading) or build buildings (for special abilities) to create an engine. Players use their hand cards to buy buildings (multi-use cards). 
The active player picks a role card which represents an action. All players can do this action, but the active player gets an additional benefit (privilege). After that, the next player picks one of the remaining role cards and so on. The game ends after the 12th building has been built.

Possible roles:
a) Builder - place a building card on the table and pay it with the remaining cards from the hand
b) Producer - place cards from the draw deck on production buildings face down (cards now represent goods)
c) Trader - sell goods to draw new cards to the hand (the number depends on the goods and their current trade value)
d) Councillor - draw several cards from the draw deck and keep one
e) Prospector- only the active player draws 1 card

Pros:
+ Very smooth and elegant gameplay
+ Artwork is quite beautiful and much better than the first edition
+ The second edition includes the expansions which add more replayability and some balancing tweaks (however, events are not included)
+ Clever use of multi-used cards (pay for buildings, used as goods, or used as additional victory points)
+ Indirect player interaction via role selection and order of players
+ Role selection provides interesting decisions: players want to be most efficient, but they also want other players not to benefit as much as oneself
+ Super portable: can be packed into a small deck box (a lot of game in a small package!)
+ Easy to teach
+ Quite short playing time (with experienced players)
+ Plays well with all player counts (but differently)
+ Well written rules
+ Nearly no down-time
+ Almost family friendly (with older kids)

Neutrals:
# Theme is okay (Caribbean, economic)
# Luck of draw happens sometimes
# Trade values are unknown in the beginning. There are 5 different cards for trade values which are cycled during a game. The order is different each game, but it does not change (adds a memory element)

Cons:
- Comes in a way too big box
- Minor issue: city buildings from the expansion have a colored background which is the sign for the production buildings

Thoughts:
San Juan is a portable and quicker version of its big brother Puerto Rico. San Juan is the lighter game but still has a lot of depth for such a "small" game. The Caribbean theme is nice and appeals to most people. The flow of the game is very smooth: someone picks a role, all players do the action, and check their buildings for special abilities. Well done!

Similar games: 
* Puerto Rico (the deeper and more complex board game with longer playing time)
* Race for the Galaxy (more complex and deeper, lot of iconography, hard to teach)
* Glory to Rome (more complex, role-selection, multi-used cards)
* Citadels (role selection, direct player interaction)

Lots of fun. I like that the cards used for resources are never revealed so there's no real way to know if the card you REALLY WANT will EVER come out of the deck (unless you cycle through the whole deck). I play this as 2 player mostly but it scales to more without trouble.

Not a game I'm really interested in playing outside of the setting of my eldest daughter (8) and me. It is perfecting in this setting though -

* Very quick set up and take down.
* Simple rules
* Plenty of combinations to explore.
* Enough luck to make it competitive if players aren't too advanced of one another.

This could even jump to a 9 for its purpose. I'll have to see how it holds up to 50+ plays.

San Juan is a quick playing engine building game that the whole family enjoys.  Scoring tends to be tight at the end and everyone feels like they are still in the running to win.  Highly recommend the Second Edition vs. First because the expansion cards add some much needed variety.

Strong card game that has that Puerto Rico flavor for lovers of that classic. It has plenty of interesting decisions, you need to be aware of what everyone else is doing so that your role selections do not help them more than you, and you card play can counter-attack or benefit from their advantages. I love how everyone starts the same and as the game progresses it becomes asymetric.

Great game. Easy to learn and teach the rules. No setup time. Only takes up a bit of space on the table.

Cards serve 3 functions:
   When they are in your hand, they are currency. 
   When they are face up in your tableau, they are production/city buildings.
   When they are face down on production buildings, they are resources.

This is the second edition, which contains lots of new buildings. Having never played the first edition, I suspect these buildings are vital to giving the game its excellent replay value as they provide lots of tactics to make each game unique.

Always happy to play this card game. I love that it feels a bit like Puerto Rico, but can hit the table much more with its lighter depth and shorter play time. Also travels well. I have played it in cafes. I find it a relaxing game to play and it has enough depth for what I am looking for in a short-ish card game. If I want more depth, I'll pull out Puerto Rico. Quite simple rules. I think San Juan will be staying in my top ten for a very long time.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
I haven't played Race for the Galaxy in ages, so I'll ignore the comparisons to that one for now (need to go back and explore that one).  I have recently played "The City" as a 2p game, and found this one to be more enjoyable and way less random.  This one does take longer, and because of that I think both can sit on their own merits, but If i and that extra 20min, I'd rather play this one, even though I like the theme on "The City" (and the art) much better!  This is one I would like to explore much more (at various player counts as well)!

Same game as the original, but with the expansion, in the medium-sized Alea box that I collect anyway. A very obvious must-buy.

Great and simple role selection game that has a nice mix between strategy and a little luck. Gets better the more you play it, as you'll get to know what combos to look for.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, simple, light-medium weight tableau-builder / engine-builder card game version of a renown game (Puerto Rico) that capture the same feel, all in a small package and at a great price.
++ Good replayability from the different card drawn and the many path to victory.
++ Good card graphic design, that is clean and clear.
++ Good value, as all Alea title (component of relatively good quality, but great price point).
++ Easy to teach, fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The box is way too big for this game. It could have easily fit in Alea's new Very Small Box series.
-- The game is a tiny bit more luck-based than I would like, but with a few games played, you learn how to mitigate this.

Puerto Rico the card game. Gives you the feel of Puerto Rico but in a much faster game. I'm not the biggest fan of Puerto Rico as it feels a bit too scripted for my taste and San Juan improves on that. However, like most card or dice versions of heavy Euros, it does lose some depth. Still a very enjoyable game that should appeal to most.

Playing this after already knowing RftG was not a problem and it's clear how they both were developed from the same central idea. It's easier than RftG due to the action selection not being simultaneous and the buildings being a little more straight forward but it still has the same tableau-building benefits that I enjoy in a card game. The theme of building a city also comes across a little easier than the space theme in race for me. It's hard to say which one I enjoy more at this point, but I lean towards San Juan ever so slightly because of the theme.

Nifty card game version of Puerto Rico. I prefer the source board game a bit more, but the card game does play a lot better with 2, which is good for my wife and me. I will be keeping this for sure and may actually get rid of Puerto Rico as San Juan will see a lot more play I think.

I like the game's engine well enough, but I just think there are other games that have come out in the intervening years that a.) play in the same amount of time, and b.) have slightly more interesting mechanics. Don't get me wrong: "San Juan" is still a solid play. If this were 2004, I'd rate it a perfect 10. But it's 2017 and time has perhaps dulled the luster on it somewhat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
This is a solid game. Cards have multiple uses, so players will have to make choices about which way each card can best be put to service. It also has that classic euro feel where one feels like there's so much more you want to do, but there is nowhere near enough time to do it.

San Juan is much like Race for the Galaxy, but quicker, easier to introduce, and more streamlined. Those are good qualities, but that doesn't inherently make it a better game than Race - just a different / very good game.

Great game. I get the love for RftG, but this was a bigger winner for us because it's so much easier to get to the table. The role decision adds lots of tension and strategy to the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simplified version of Puerto Rico that is also a simplified version of Race for the Galaxy.  RftG is a much better game, but is notoriously difficult to get into because of the iconography.  San Juan scratches the RftG itch without the bewilderment.

This is one of the games that was on our wishlist the longest. When we were a little short on free shipping on an order, I decided we had put it off long enough and it was time to put it on the shelf. SO GOOD! The perfect weight for weeknight gaming and the second edition has all the fun extra cards and improved artwork.

Beautiful components. I think the purple expansion cards make the game more random. I think the Cathedral is unnecessary but suspect the modified rules for scoring the Guild Hall are probably a good move for game balance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Wasn't 100% convinced of the merits of this. I got it to act as a training game for RftG as that was off putting to some players, but I don't think it's a great improvement on that front. There's no hieroglyphs, but the experienced RftG player will still walk all over the newbie in this (despite the fact it's a different game).

RATING: 8.1
A very good medium-weight engine building/racing card game for small groups of players. Mechanically quite simple, but there are many strategic options available to players. It's all about building an engine of card combos, and will appeal to players who like that. The interaction between players is basically limited to the role selection, so it has a multiplayer solitaire feel to it (Puerto Rico is much more interactive). Inexperienced players are at very steep disadvantage until they learn all the cards and understand the combos possible, which can take many plays. The "churn rate" of cards is quite high - you'll usually shuffle the deck at least once during the course of a game - so there is a good chance that any particular card will at some point be in your hand.

The second edition fixes some subtle balance issues, and adds in the best parts of the expansion.

I first played San Juan via the Android app, and immediately fell in love with the game. I eventually picked up the physical copy of the game, and introduced it to some of my friends. This is easily one of my favorite games I own for a few reasons: it's easy to teach, it's fun, it's portable, and it offers complex strategy and decision making. What else can I say? It's an amazing game!

Lovely new edition of the classic card game.  We'd played a ton of the first edition of San Juan, and the cards were looking distinctly tired.

One of my favorite games. It's rewarding to build your own economic engine, look around the table, and see that your friends have their own engines that work in completely different ways. You'll walk away satisfied after losing games because you had fun building your economy.

There are a lot of paths to victory and a lot of ways to find synergy between different buildings. The game is full of interesting decisions, and theres a lot of player interaction- trying to figure out what roles your friends are going to pick and finding ways to benefit yourself.

On top of all this, its light enough to finish in an hour and introduce to new players.

San Juan was my first tableau style card game. It was eventually replaced by Gosu, Race for the Galaxy, Seasons. When I heard about and saw pictures of this edition, I thought it might be nice to give it a try. Especially since they rebalanced some of the cards that people thought were OP. I do think this is much better than the original version (despite not including or being able to use the event expansion with this) since it includes the extra building from the Treasure Chest expansion. 

The main reason I decided not to keep it is because I also acquired Roll for the Galaxy around the same time. I personally would much rather play Roll than San Juan. It could be argued that while Roll is easier to learn than Race, it's still a lot more difficult than San Juan. While that's true, I think it's worth the extra effort. If the person can't handle Roll, I'll just play another more simplistic that I own.  This is still a good game, but there are other games I personally prefer and I like to keep a trim collection.

I like this game quite a lot, and after owning Race for the Galaxy a year sooner. Simply said, there is a Goldie Locks zone for games that are easy to teach to non-gamers, yet provide a gamer's desired depth and decision-making.

Yes, RftG is a more complex, brainier version of "Puerto Rico as a card game." I grasped its mechanics and strategy, and appreciate the deviation of theme. When it comes down to it, though, I need games like San Juan because I want to play games with people encompassing a broad range of experience. I probably won't be teaching my grandma how to play this one, but my mom, wife, or daughter might come to appreciate my hobby all the more through an offering like San Juan.

I haven't played it very many times but I feel like I've got some pretty high scores.

I like this but I find Race for the Galaxy more interesting.  That said, if you're overwhelmed by the iconography in Race, try this one!  Or try this one as an intro as you warm up to Race.  Very similar mechanism of using cards for production and to pay for things, and of only certain roles being taken certain turns but then everyone can use that action - with the chooser getting a benefit.

An apparent classic in the world of board gaming.  Two games in, and I can sense that it is good, although this type of game (each card tweeks an advantage, money is tight, cards are multi-purpose) is not my favourite type of gaming.  For now, a very solid 8.185 (August 2015).  UODATE: Its probably not an 8 (especially with only 2 players).  Definitely get a feel like Puerto Rico, but also a sense of just having to deal with what you get.  Would play again (Rating 7.326, Nov 16)

I've long been a fan of the original game and have logged 68 plays of same, so obtaining the 2nd Edition was a foregone conclusion.  I am a little disappointed in the elimination of the violet color scheme of the non-production buildings in favor of calling those cards, "city cards" and the generally muted colors - a bit more vibrancy in that area would have been nice. It's sad that the plastic box insert has been replaced by flimsy cardboard that is sure to be discarded by most owners, I would suspect.  Having said what I said, my hope is to play this new version at least as many times as the old.

I enjoy the role selection. I don't enjoy the race aspect of the game: if an opponent gets ahead building, it can quickly become apparent that you're out of it; it also seems to amplify luck of the draw.

This game was purchased primarily to play as a 2P game with my spouse, but it turns out to work terrifically at all player counts! While we enjoy Puerto Rico, this game takes everything that was enjoyable about the parent game and boils it down into an even better card game in San Juan. The role selection mechanic is a fairly underutilized one in games, and has you pick a certain action each round, allowing your opponents to take the action after you do - should they choose - however you get a bonus privilege for choosing the role first. There is a wide array of building cards to choose from, making several strategy styles available, and offering many buildings which synergize with specific role cards, adding an extra element of strategy to the role selection process, as certain actions may trigger buildings in your opponent's tableau. Perhaps most appealing, this is a medium to light weight strategy game, meaning the rules are easy enough most newcomers to the hobby should be able to grasp it, while there is enough depth that experienced gamers can have fun diving in as well.  Final plus: It's extremely portable and sets up in 2 minutes.

Very fast card tableau builder that shares a lot of similarities to Puerto Rico that it should be called PR: The Card Game. But while PR has no luck element in it, this one relies quite a bit of luck to get those combo cards going.

This new edition of San Juan is as good as the original. The new buildings in the included expansion are not essential (and can be left out of the game), but they do add variety and open up some new strategic possibilities for veteran players.

Given the out-of-print nature of the first edition and the lack of anything that takes away from the game in this edition, picking up this new version of San Juan is a no-brainer.

Plus I feel with a this kind of game, a player's engine should build up during the corse of the game. Maybe we're just not good enough but the pace of the game was very flat. It just chugged along from beginning to end with no real sense of growth/power. I'd have loved to have seen more synergy between certain card combos but... Flat.

One of my top 5 games, distills Puerto Rico down into a beautiful card game with just enough luck and (relatively) quick play time.  I love the role-selection/privilege system and recommend the new buildings from the expansion (or 2nd edition) for extra strategies.

After initially being underwhelmed by the first edition of San Juan several years ago, this revised edition strikes me with much more appeal. Part of the reason for this change is how my own tastes have evolved since then; this is essentially the same game with some new cards and updated artwork. San Juan sung on key this time around, whereas it felt a bit muted and flat before. This is a wonderful way to spend part of an evening, and the portability is a bonus for taking on the road easily.

You don't have to be on the BGG very long before you come across Puerto Rico (PR). Knowing that PR is a somewhat involved game, taking up to 2 hours and having what some newbies would consider daunting mechanics, I was excited to hear about it's lighter card-game brother San Juan.

I wanted to learn the basics on my own before I taught it to my gaming group, so I ended up buying the iOS version. I've played that about 5-6 times now. I just got the hard copy and played a 2-player game with someone from my gaming group. Wow! It's so much better playing people than just the AI on the iOS version. It ran a little longer than expected, but after playing a rather dissapointing Catan session recently with the same group [rolls often prevented anyone from doing much; the game dragged on] this was fresher, faster, and you pretty much always have something to do. Keeping up with the card powers will take some getting used to (the iOS version assists with this).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great way to get the feel of Puerto Rico in a much shorter time. I have only played 2 and 3 player live, but 4-player on the Android app and all player counts play well. I agree with the general consensus (at this time) with the voting that 3-player is best, but I actually bought it to mostly play 2-player. The rules make the game a little more fiddly than necessary (e.g., discarding cards used as goods produced and drawing new cards), but the action is smooth and quick. 
If you haven't played Puerto Rico, well, first, I'm sorry, and second, that shouldn't impact your enjoyment of this game. The "themes" of building, producing, and trading are more abstract and you might feel like you are just moving cards around, but it does make thematic sense.
Like most card or dice derivatives of larger games, this one doesn't replace the original, but it will likely get more play time for me due to the 2-player accessibility. Great game.

The fact that I am not very good at this game shouldn't detract from the fact that I think it is a great game in general. It is essentially an update on Puerto Rico, and I think it manages to mitigate most of Puerto Rico's downsides without creating too many downsides of its own. The fact that it is a card game with minimal other pieces is also a bonus - we've managed to fit the whole game (tightly) into a standard deck box, making it very portable. 

This game is best for moderately interested gamers - it's not incredibly intense (especially since I'm a somewhat casual geek) but it does dig a little deeper into strategy and mechanics than is appropriate for the most casual of family dinners. However, its small footprint makes it worth bringing along to a game meetup even if you're not sure if the folks involved will be gamers, since most folks will have a good time. I would also consider this a great "gateway game", as it introduces a lot of mechanics and ideas common to this style of game.

If I had to make a mechanical complaint, it's the fact that the game is not perfectly balanced. Some cards, like the park/crane, are fairly useless, since there's almost always a better use for your finite building space. Others, like an early harbor or chapel, can easily create a snowball lead. That said, with experienced players, there is still enough room for both strategy and luck that creates a fulfilling game even if half of it becomes a race for the best "super card". Besides, someone can always eke out a last minute victory with the Cathedral. 

As I said earlier, I'm no good at this game. And as should be apparent from my other reviews, I greatly prefer co-op to competitive games. That said, despite repeatedly losing to my husband, I come away from every game of San Juan having had fun, occasionally even managing to squeak out a victory from time to time. To me, that's an excellent measure of success - even when you lose, you still have fun.

Puerto Rico meets Race for the Galaxy in the best ways possible. Easy to learn and play - the built-in expansion adds enough variety for longevity. Somewhat multi-player solitaire though. Not a huge impact on others' games.

San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and "violet" buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.

I really, really like this game. I mean, I really do.

The only problem with it is after a few plays, I find myself gravitating towards the same inevitable tactical optimizations about how to score the most possible points. It seems that once you've played a lot of times, you look for a few certain cards and thats pretty much the end of it. 

Still, its a terrific game. 

This is a great game that is easily teachable and a lot of fun.

Wow I think this has killed Roll for the Galaxy for me. This is because I'm not really a fan of dice placement, and the two things I think Roll did better than Race, being easier to learn and being more apparent of the indirect interaction of opponents leeching off your chosen phases are also done in San Juan. For the latter, I especially prefer the variable phase order of San Juan versus the simultaneous action selection of the two RftGs.

In fact, I might like San Juan more than Race with no expansions (although I think there is room for both). I thought I would miss the more varied development powers of race and the ability to also get VPs from consuming in Race more, but I also really like how San Juan feels more elegant. One thing I do really miss though are the tactical decisions early-mid game of whether to switch to a different engine (or run a hybrid) if what you draw doesn't combo with your tableau. San Juan does have a little bit, but that e.g. different goods only really matter due to their sell price and not like Race's set collection points or card effect bonuses for having certain colors means it feels like the choices are less varied.

EDIT: I'm starting to miss the greater variation of cards a lot more in Race, and so it is not better than Race base game after all. I also think I've gotten a good enough picture of the game to make the below assertions, considering I've tried this game vs. an expert AI on Condado 3 times, winning 2 and losing the third on tie breaker.

That all violet cards are directly tied to drawing more cards, making things cheaper, or straight points with always only a single effecy per card causes too much abstraction that makes the soulless efficiency engine too apparent. The lack of difference of goods, even less so than Puerto Rico where uniqueness matters for Captain and Trader is also bothering me more. Also, there are a lot of these cards in the deck, yey the inability to use them to get VPs from them seems to mean you often only want 1 or 2. 

I still like the variable phase order more when it works well, but there are quite a few times when your only options left help your opponents as much or more than yourself, and so you wish you had the option to pass. Race's ability to choose the same phase as someone else alleviates this, and often when you have no actions that can benefit you significantly anymore the game is almost over anyways, rather than still having half of its duration left.

Still fun from time to time, but if the people I'm playing with already know most of Race's iconography I'd rather play that than this 90% of the time.

A pretty enjoyable tableau building game which is effectively Puerto Rico the card game.  You start with an indigo plant.  You put out new buildings by selecting the builder role which gives the player Newhouse selected a discount of one card to pay for a card built. Each card has cost you pay in other cards. The hand limit is 7 cards but each card you build generates other card s, discounts costs or provides points at the end of the game.  Game ends when one player builds 12 buildings.  Each building scores points for itself and some score end of game points.  

Very good game and you can play this with newish gamers.  The only annoying thing is you need to constantly remind yourself of the special abilities on your cards.  

Very solid game.  I love the cool expansion cards

Very solid card game. I prefer it to Puerto Rico and it has been a really successful title in my house. The cards function as currency, buildings, resources, and it's the multi-use aspect of the cards that makes the game work so well. Very clean design that should stand the test of time.

A really fun game that sets up and tears down in less than a minute. Brilliant multiple use of cards that eliminates need for money tokens and wooden bits for resources. I have never played Puerto Rico which is the board game on which San Juan is based or Race for the Galaxy which appears to be seems to be San Juan in a space theme. Just well done all around, nice box for storage, artwork that is interesting and easy to learn  mechanics. The strategy is varied but so far it appears a good one is to develop productions building to produce resources, sell the resources and build building and not go broke or out of sync in the process. I have played two player and it is great as two player  and it even says that right on the box.

The Puerto Rico -> San Juan -> Race For The Galaxy evolution of the Variable Phase Order idea was an experimentation in how much is too much minutiae management.

For my gaming group Puerto Rico had too many rules for too boring of a theme and art-style. That game's components were mocked relentlessly even while I tried to slog through the rules.

Race For The Galaxy has a better theme, better art, but more rules and terrible iconography.

San Juan, "The Puerto Rico Card Game", I had bypassed mainly because PR was such a flop. I returned to look at it to answer a question: Can the simplest distillation of the Variable Phase Order mechanic overcome its boring art and theme? No, it can't. Despite its flaws, RftG is more fun than San Juan.

[b]San Juan[/b] was sold via auction 4/20/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]After a couple more plays I realized that even with the expansion buildings the game doesn't have the depth I am looking for. If I want to play a lighter tableau builder then I'd much rather play Deus and RftG is my 2p go to with my son. I primarily bought it to play with my wife and she wasn't a huge fan so I ended up trading my copy.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

- Excellent family game and one my wife enjoys, it also makes a great cafe game.
- A game that plays very similar to Race for the Galaxy [i](one of my favorites)[/i] that is easy to teach.
- Multi use cards, one of my favorite game mechanisms [i](cards can be played to your tableau for points/abilities, used as goods or spent as currency)[/i].
- High replay value - a lot of interesting building synergies to discover through repeated play.

All of my comments reflect playing with the expansion buildings which are included in the second edition. I would rate the game a 6 without the expansion, I didn't think there was enough variety to the strategies you could try with just the base game. Once I added the expansion cards I really enjoyed this game.[/i]

RATING: 6
Fast-and-easy card edition of Puerto Rico. Being forced to play Race for the Galaxy multiple times has jaded me with these types of card games (role selection and empire-building). Gameplay is easy and uncomplicated but the game is a pale comparison of the game it's imitating; it doesn't fully sate my hunger for a strategy game. Maybe that's the point but I couldn't care less for it.

Having cards instead of chits (Puerto Rico) is cool.  Setup time is also great compared to Puerto Rico.  But I would have liked more depth.  The game kinda feels samey towards the end, because of card variety.  But at the same time, it kinda feels like the game is kinda short.  I know - Samey and short is a weird combination.  

Cycling through the deck is cool.  Using a card as a building or as money is cool.  I just wish the game had a little more depth.  For a light weight game, it's also pretty expensive.

RATING: 7
"Updated version of a really solid game. I'm not that fond of leaching in general, but I like it a lot better here than in PR or RftG. The reprint is mostly very nice but it's not easy to quickly tell whether a card is a building or not."

What I like:
- Multiple use of cards
- Card powers are clear and straightforward
- Including the expansion cards is a nice touch
- Plays quickly

What I don't like:
- Building cards aren't graphically differentiated
- Not a fan of leaching in general
- I wish the phases were indicated graphically, like RftG
- Some of the expansion cards are attacks

To me, Puerto Rico is an annoying bloated version of San Juan. And Race for the Galaxy is also an overly complex re-interpretation (with the added drawback of simultaneous action selection). 

San Juan hits the sweet spot, although I can't love it due to the leaching. For me, it's best played solo through the phone app. Well, I prefer the unofficial Condado app over the official game, but I own both.

A classic card game for a reason!  Great decisions to be made: which role do you select for your turn (how will that help your opponents?) and do you build a card or just use it as money?  And you're trying to get all of the cards you've built to synergize with each other.  Great game!

The game is not bad, but there are so many cards to learn. The whole game is based around knowing the cards (if you want to play it good enough) and I feel that you have to be a regular player to do ok. For me, the game does not offer enough to challenge me to learn the cards and their mutual influence.

The new art will take a little getting used to, but I really like it.  The sugar plantation and the silver smelter, in particular, look really good.  It's nice having the expansion and base game in the same box and its also nice that the card backs of the expansion and base game are exactly the same hue (card backs of the expansion in the first edition had a slightly redder hue than base cards).  Though this game, even with expansions, is lighter than Race for the Galaxy, I have grown to like it more.  I prefer the sequential selection of actions over the simultaneous selection.  I also like the fact that since only one build can happen in a given round, the game feels more like it lasts the proper length of time.  I have seen too many games of Race end with 5 cards in a tableau.  That just does not feel like a whole game to me.

Just a great game, it's got depth but is very simple to learn. Strategy is present in both which cards to use or discard (pay with), and in the action selection mechanism. Always seems to end with close scores so it's very exiting right up until the end. Perfect, small game to play anywhere where there's a table, which makes it portable as well. Very much a game you can get good at, don't let the seemingly random card draw fool you, there are a lot of ways to skillfully mitigate this.

RATING: 7
This is a quick playing card game version of puerto rico. Just like in Puerto Rico, you have the same jobs system, but everything is done in cards. The game ends when someone has built 12 buildings. When you produce resources, you put a facedown card on a resource building as that resource. When you sell the resource to get money, you just draw cards. When you pay the cost of building a building you discard cards. There's some 'draw the card you need' luck in the game, but the effects on the buildings are nice and varied, and we have a great time with it.

A nice little engine builder and simultaneous action selection game. It's much lighter than its parent game (Puerto Rico), but it still carries much of the same flavor. It plays faster and has much less setup time. Overall, this is a clever little game with the multi-use cards. Lots of tough decisions are made in the game. Additionally, I wish the game length lasted just a tad longer; it seems to end just when I got something built up and running.

San Juan is an extremely well designed card game.  Fast, fluid, thoughtful, and easy to learn.  
However, I can't help but feel that it's too smooth an experience.  The game plays out so quickly and efficiently that it doesn't feel climactic or meaningful.

That said, when you play San Juan with a group who knows it well, there's a rhythm that the game takes on.  It's like a dance where everyone knows the beats that really just sucks you into the flow.

Belated birthday present 2014 from Mum and Dad

This was one of our early favourites but I sold it off after we grew tired of the buildings and some of the more over-powered buildings (library, guild hall).

I was excited when the second edition came out as this promised to fix all of those problems and include all of the extra buildings from the expansion. I haven't been disappointed as we have now played many more games and its been fun exploring the effects of some of the newer buildings.

First game of this kind I have owned (role drafting) and I love it. Simple but strategic. Can see playing it A LOT.

RATING: 6
Perfect for the engine building enthusiast, but not so overconvoluted that it outsays its welcome (looking at you, Terraforming Mars). I can be enthused enough while playing this game, though it does not excite me very much.

(+) Card synergies allow numerous opportunities to build a resource and points churning engine.
(+) Creates a race-like feel, which is more prominent at 2 players
(+) Does not overstay its welcome, despite being somewhat repetitive. 

(-) ^Repetitive. Pick your action, augment your engine, ad inifinitum. Meh.
(-) Little to no player interaction.
(-) Game ending is anticlimactic.

The new edition with extra buildings is well worth getting. Most games now finish with only one shuffle of the deck during the game. (Okay maybe a quick second shuffle for the last turn.) The scoring has been tweaked and all the new and interesting extra buildings giving so many more choices and combinations that I've raised my ranking from a 7 to a 9. It's breathed new life into an already decent game. Not just a minor upgrade. The kids love it. The adults love it. Fun, quick and engaging. Good stuff.

Not a bad game.  But extremely dry and fun-impaired.  This might be easier to teach someone than Race for the Galaxy, but it is nowhere near as fun as that card game or it's parent board game, Puerto Rico.  The 6.25 rating here is generous, based mostly on the game design, which is actually good.  But it just isn't fun.

This game has grown on me. I did not care for it the first time I played it, but I now enjoy it quite a bit.  It does a good job of capturing the feel of Puerto Rico in a quick, simple card game.  There is a lot more luck in the game, which is one thing I did not care for at first.  However, that makes you change up your strategy and makes this more of a tactical game.

2016: 9. (Comments from 1st Edition) I've only played the physical game once, but have had many sessions on the phone version.  I can totally see why this game is a perennial favourite.  Very pleasant, casual play and yet at the same time it can be quite competitive!  Brilliant design.  I will probably always prefer to play this rather than Puerto Rico.

2nd Edition thoughts: haven't played with the new buildings yet to see how they change the game, but they seem to open up alternate paths to victory.

It's like Race for the Galaxy and Puerto Rico had a one night stand resulting in a child that is less attractive and less clever than either of its parents.

The new Alea/Ravensberger San Juan comes in a box that is much too big for what it is.  It also has a much less functional insert than the old Alea/Rio Grande edition.  Solution is to pack all of the new game into the old box.  I had to keep the pay-off tiles from the old edition as the new ones are just a hair too big for the old insert.  It all fits fairly well, though the side of the box with the cards has the cover floating up just slightly.

Very good game with engaging play.  Good at all player counts.  Play seem different with the various player counts.  Really good 2 player game.  Wife approved!

RATING: 7
It's among my go-to gateway games because it serves as a great bridge to Puerto Rico, and other role selection games like Mottainai.

Greatly prefer this to Race for the Galaxy because it's far simpler and the Puerto Rico-style role selection system maintains a semblance of player interaction that is almost completely absent in Race.

RATING: N/A
card game version of "Puerto Rico", but somewhat different
said to be actually good (not like most other card game versions of board games)

Problem is that it is a bit redundant if you have "Puerto Rico".
But "San Juan" has two advantages over "Puerto Rico": 2 player game and shorter playing time.

box oversized, which is unfortunate else it would make a good game to take on holidays

I prefer RftG's hidden action selection. I also prefer the Consume Trade functionality vs the Trade action. San Juan is simpler due to lack of iconography, but also less interesting in terms of game play.

Comes with solo rules

This is a pretty tight game, all about hand management and getting things built at the right time. In the 2nd edition there aren't any events, but the purple "expansion" cards (included in the box) really make the game more balanced (luck of the draw). It's rather lacking in theme, but the mechanics are solid. Just make sure to resolve ALL the effects of your tableau cards (can be a little tricky)

This is the definitive version of San Juan. I sold my first edition, with expansion, as soon as I heard this was coming out and I have no regrets at all now that I've played the second edition.

It incorporates the expansion buildings (the useless events from the original expansion are not included) and there is a new building, the hut. The cards all seem to have properly translated text now, where the 1st edition expansion buildings had some very noticeable errors. I've also read that two or three buildings were rebalanced for this version, and the game seems to be much better for it.

The bottom line: whether or not you already own San Juan, get this version. Excellent game, and it serves as a great introduction to both Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy.

Update: I really feel like the Harbour is overpowered. It costs 4 to build, but if built early it can easily provide 7-10 VP for free. Comparing this to a 6-cost building, the 6-cost might gain you the same amount of points but you have to spend a lot of the game working toward getting those points. With the Harbour the points are automatic (you always have at least an indigo to sell). As much as I hate houserules, I'll be removing the card from future games.

A card game that stands strong on its own.  Wow!  While we just got this game I can see packing it up and taking it with us on a trip.  Small enough to fit in two deck boxes, but enough depth to the game to play several times in a row.

Similar to RftG, but a lot more accessible. Also, the theme is very close to my theming sweet spot (farming/manufacturing in the 1800s). This makes me prefer this game over Race. If only Roll had this theme... that would have easily been a 10.

The second edition has a handful of new buildings and some rules tweaks, but honestly, I don't know that they change the game a great amount. But it's also not like this game really needed any changing. San Juan is a great game, which I enjoy a lot, and it's not like there were any fatal flaws in the first edition.

The new buildings are nice (with the exception of the Park, which I'm not sure why you'd bother) as are most of the rules tweaks (the guildhall in particular, although I think the goldmine may have gotten unfairly dinged). And the new artwork works a lot better. I looked at the old "violet buildings" and I much prefer the tan background on the new cards.

Nice and light game for travels. For it to become a favourite in the genre like Glory to Rome it would need more player interaction. Relaxing and not taxing card game for when that is what you feel like.

This version's more detailed art is offset by it's reduced playability. City (formerly violet) cards are visually virtually indistinguishable from their production counterparts.  So much so that I'll never play this edition again.

The new rules for the Guild Hall and Prefecture cost make sense. The Hut does not.

Got the new English version recently. The additional buildings are a welcome benefit as the core set the original came with were getting a bit long in tooth. It's still a very good game.

Mi juego favorito para llevar de viaje, transportable pero con chicha, no como la mayoría de juegos pequeños que pecan de sencillez.

Sus mecánicas en las que las cartas se usan para todo (monedas, edificios, mercancias) me parecen una maravilla porque te evita usar componentes adicionales sin que por ello pierda profundidad y lo hacen muy fácil de transportar.

I like San Juan quite a bit, but the rules for this one kinda threw me. Since I own the first edition, I don't see the need to own this one, but I wouldn't turn down playing it, either. For all intents and purposes, though, I prefer the original edition.

Long ago when this first released I passed on it. Who needs a card game version of Puerto Rico that plays similar to Race for the Galaxy?  San Juan second edition made me realize that we needed it. This game plays very well, is a lot of fun, and brings back good Puerto Rico memories.

[microbadge=31774] A good game that I'm happy to play anytime, but currently not in our collection for the following reason: 

Brought this over to Burke and KO's and taught it to them. They enjoyed it, so we decided to gift it to them so they could play together on their own or teach other friends.

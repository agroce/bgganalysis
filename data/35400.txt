I bought this game because, unlike the wonderful Combat Commander, it had tanks. This is also the first chit-pull type war game I've played. I found I didn't much like the chit-pull system. Otherwise, it's just a basic tactical WWII war game with a conventional, though thankfully simple, approach. Its simplicity is all there is to recommend it.

Nowdays if I want tanks I play the Band of Brothers system instead.

In the end, I really cannot stand the stupid names for the towns. And I don't like the fact tjat there are few formations in each scenario, so that luck plays a role too important. Not to mention the fact that the scenarios are just fantasy: look at the Arnhem one, for instance.

Disclaimer... I am a WSR playtester/scenario designer so I am inclined to view this game favorably.  I really love this game [will write a full review to provide more detail]... beautiful components, solid system derived from the WaW rules with changes to reflect WWII.  Lots of fun to play... and I should know given how many times I have played most of the scenarios in the box.

RATING: 6.5
The game is a simplified version of WaW (already a very easy game). It does not stand the comparison with its predecessor. WSR plays easy but never gives a true challenge to the player. On top of this, the rulebook is not very well written leaving too many things up to the reader intuition. Counters are misprinted and map boards easily warp. Overall the quality of the product is good in any regard but not a game for hard core war-gameres. LnL remains of course Walker's masterpiece.

This is a fun and engaging WWII Platoon level game.  It plays excellent solitaire because of the chit pull mechanism and possible chaos events.  The scenarios are interesting and payable in 90 minutes.  The rules are streamlined and simple.  No CRTs, everything in on the counter.  Just enough chrome.  Super game.

Update -- On reflection, still fails the visual readability/playability test; (Or, "why are such big counters printed with such gawdawful small anemic numbers?") 

 (2014) Provisional rating after two scenarios.

My main concern so far is the graphics.  The overall map and counter look is relatively dark.  The color schemes appear historically accurate, but this is a two-edged sword.  In combination with the darkish maps, I find more ambiguity in distinguishing the dark green American and feldgrau Ger units than I'd like.  I play in a well-lit area, so this is a concern.  

I find it also especially ironic that, despite 3/4" counters, many of the numeric values and unit i.d. verbage does not stand out better.  This may be the font choice, or maybe failing eyes; but given the size of the counters, I am surprised to be dealing with so much counter readibility issues right off the bat.  I am playing this thing under 200W of light, and distinguishing unit nationality and values should not be such a challenge.  This of itself is a significant disappointment.  I bought this thing in general for a graphic upgrade from PB/PL; looked great on line, but it falls short on my table. 

Game -- too early to make a full assessment, but also a mixed bag of pro/con vs. PB or PL.  More dynamic infantry is a plus, the continuing dice-fest is a neutral.  More as I play it.

This game  has potential but it is in it's 1.0 version. Rulebook needs to be cleanup a bit for ambiguous rules and missing explanations of markers. Scenarios are OK. Highly random for the outcome given the chit pull and dice rolling requirements. A low complexity game that can be played in an hour or so.

A disappointment that can still be fun to play with house rules.  It's as though the game was simplified to the point that real issues crop up almost every session.  We pitched the chit pull, which I usually love, as it makes no sense here and leads to terribly unbalanced situations.

There are typically only one or at most two chits per side, so the issue of one player getting to "move twice" before the other has a chance to move becomes a real issue.  Worse, with turn ending chits in the cup, the potential is there for one player to get two activations to another players single one.  In the typical eight turn scenario the chits can determine the game.

Other anomalies abound.  Infantry jump off their trucks ... which can magically reappear later.  Mortar and AT gun crews get their asses kicked in close combat, and retreat with their guns.

As I say, we play Igo-Ugo, ditch the Fate points, restrict infantry from reverting to transport, and eliminating those gun crews forced to retreat.  The result of such a lobotomy is a light, fun platoon level game.

My hunt for a platoon level *simulation* that's playable continues ...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun light and quick gameplay - really excellent components (large 3/4" counters, mounted maps, great graphics).

Chit pull activation means it solo's well, but with gameplay this quick and simple its a great weeknight game too.

RATING: 5
It's a nicely designed and produced system, with some interesting mechanics and presentation.  It has a good, varied mix of unit types, and formations those unit types are grouped into (though, if you like this game, you NEED to get the "Operation Cobra" expansion to really flesh the game out).  And the four maps provide a decent, though not great, mix of terrain.

However, after several games a growing pile of reality-check issues set me off of this game.  That's a shame, as I think the basic design is a good low complexity game, but the details produce more bizarre results than I care to deal with.

For me at least, the BIG problem is the mortars. Now, I fully realize that it is possible for a direct hit to cause some important damage, such as damage treads, or catch a crewman with his head out of his hatch, but I've read several sources, including first hand accounts and an acquaintance that was an armored company commander in Iraq in 1990, that state that as long as they stayed buttoned up they could mostly ignore mortars and other light artillery. But, right out the starting gate, in my first game I found a tiger advancing on a village with only a mortar and a US M5 Stuart in its way. The mortar scored two hits on the tiger, disrupting and reducing it, and then the M5 assaulted it and destroyed it.

Made me wonder why the British felt they needed 17pdrs.

The real problem is not that a mortar COULD do damage to a single tank, it's that the game gives mortars a very good chance to at least disrupt, and even cause a step loss, to a platoon of tanks. To me, the chance is just WAY to high.

Now, the second major concern is the HQ combat bonus. I feel that this warps the game considerably. In fact, the abuse is most significantly highlighted when an HQ is paired with a mortar. Suddenly, for all practical purposes that 81mm mortar with an HQ is like a death ray out to the limit of the mortar's range.

Other problems occur also. For instance, have a critical unit you want to protect from indirect fire? Stack something with it and there is a 50% chance the other unit will take the hit instead (oh, and being near tanks protects infantry against indirect fire). Need to get your halftracks past an anti-tank gun? Dismount the infantry, walk past, and then remount.  Also, some of the ratings on the units are suspect...the M4 Sherman did NOT have thin armor, and the armor on the Comet is crazy.  The 57mm/6pdr actually had better armor piercing performance than the 75mm on the M4.  And so on. 

All other pros and cons of a 'formation activation' system aside, in a game where there tend to be only one or two such formations on each side, a 'turn end, to bad' mechanic tends to produce to many turns where one side or another does nothing.

Finally, Assault combat is, to me, a mess. Beyond that a stuart has almost the same chance to hurt a tiger as that tiger has to hurt a stuart, there are infantry anti-tank support weapons that have no affect in assault, infantry can charge three hexes and attack a tank in the open with a considerable chance of success, and the separate Overrun Rule seems like just a special case of Assault that adds little for additional complexity.

Great game!
Components are very nice; Unit counter art is beautiful, some of the info marker colors (out of command, chaos) dont fit with the rest of the game. Boards are hard mounted, graphically simular to the ones in the World at War series. Game play is fast and fun. Rules are good - not in love with layout and organization but they are fairly clear and efective.
Looking forward to the Desert Heat Expansion.

This game has become my go-to game when I get the wargame itch.  It's a simple system to learn (only 8 pages of rules!), and has turn limits for each scenario, so it doesn't take hours to play.  The maps are mounted, and of good quality. (I've had none of the mold/spotting problems others have had), the counters are larger than the norm, with great artwork for the vehicles.  Yes, the chit pull system has it's drawbacks, but then, it's hard to find a wargame rules set that doesn't have at least one.

There are definitely more complicated systems out there, but for putting wargames in reach of the masses, this is pretty near the top.  I love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good, quick, simple game.  The chief difference from the World at War scenarios is that this game is too small, usually only one or two formations on each side. Also the scenarios feel more driven by the turn limit than by the enemy forces.  For both reasons the failure to activate, which should happen roughly twice a game for each formation, can have disproportionate effect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I judge this as the most accessible of the platoon-level World War II tactical games; really good for getting people into the genre.  The graphics are generally eye-pleasing (if not always the clearest on the counters without having to use a magnifying glass for older eyes), the physical components are durable, the game system fast-playing and interactive to keep your attention throughout.  But the design emphasis is on the game and less the simulation.  Die-hard tactical grognards will find much to gripe about.  

Only MMP's PANZERBLITZ: HILL OF DEATH and CARENTAN module can be considered comparable at this scale.  Reaction to that system has been relatively lukewarm, while NATIONS AT WAR as been refined from the very successful WORLD AT WAR WW III modern warfare tactical series.  I like both for different reasons.  While this and the games in the PANZERGRENADIER series are platoon-level tactical treatments, the Avalanche Press game is in another league altogether--more rules (and not the most clear as printed) with production corner cutting and glitches in a number of titles and a good number of scenarios (but many considered unbalanced).  I'm a devoted PANZERGRENADIER player too (love that system and all the variety), but it's not something I'd use to introduce gamers to tactical games with.

Lock 'N Load bills its motto as "More game and less guff" and WHITE STAR RISING certainly delivers on that score.  Great fun to play and I'd even be tempted to term it a "beer and pretzels" game for those who know what that means.  Bite your fingernails waiting for the chit you want to get pulled, move your pieces, and enjoy the shoot 'em up!

A light-ish platoon level WWII wargame.  There is quite a bit of abstraction here - simulation sacrificed for quick play.  That is not to say that it isn't true to the subject material.  There is a lot to like about the design and the production is pretty darn good.  I wish they would have used historical place names and unit names instead of faux names.  It fills a niche for a platoon wargame that place quick with minimal fuss.

Great game, love the system. My complaints are mainly with the design/quality... the boards could be a bit bigger (I'm not a fan of high counter stacks) and all of my are warped so counters slip easily and also they don't line up with combined.  

On a personal note -- which doesn't affect my score -- I wish the map was drawn by the artist who did Lock n Load... the NAW (and WAW) maps seem a bit lifeless and also certain elements like the drop shadows implementation make the buildings appear to be floating are a bit disappointing.

RATING: 7
Played it as a miniaturized version with microarmour instead of counters.

I like the card activation where a force can miss a turn and be guaranteed an activation in the next turn by a player holding one of the three "End of Turn" Cards.

Prepared positions are very powerful and attackers need a lot of advantages to counter.

Not a lot of tables to look up, just the random event table if the card comes up.

Hex based movement and abstracting facing is nice and clean.

Two of us, veteran gamers, experienced with various tactical games from Panzerblitz/leader to ASL gave it a first go. Found the rules concise, fairly clean, mostly intuitive. Counters a bit hard to distinguish in low light (we're both over 50 and wear glasses). But counter quality good, maps up to AH standards. Full color rule book very nice. Play aids adequate. Sampled most of the rules using one of the pre-pub special scenarios. Initial impression good, we both plan another go, think we will like it. 

Some rules questions did come up which I will post later and which hold the game rating down a little. We worked around them, but would like a few designer rulings. Overall though - nice, less fiddly than Panzer Grenadier series, much easier than ASL, cleaner and less of a dice fest than Heroes series. Easier than most squad/platoon leader "light" level games preceding it as far as we can tell.

Much worse than WaW system - too simplistic and also it looks too obvious that this was not primarily prepared for WWII. I once loved WaW system, but from first time with this game, something feeled wrong for me and my group too. Especially activation system does not work so smoothly with WWII. Missing moving fire does not help either, so whole game feels much more static. Some scenarios does not seems well balanced. And as already stated it is not much fun.

 First class contents, mounted maps, nice BIG counters, color rulebook, and laminated charts. A modernized Panzer Leader in a way, but with everything upgraded. I was one of the first ones to receive a copy  it looks like, and JD and I liked the first impression we got of it. I've since played in on VASSAL, and using Skype it's like a face-to-face game. Glad to see Mark going with the flow on VASSAL, my opponent in upstate NY doesn't have the game, but now after playing he's buying a copy for his wargaming group!

Fast playing WWII platoon scale light wargame.  Very similar to the World at War series from which it is derived.  The forces here are more evenly balanced in both capabilities and quantities, and the ranges on the weapons are less than the WWIII systems, so it plays a bit differently.  

The chit draw system with the random activation order can make a big difference in the outcomes of scenarios.  It makes it fun to play solo, but I think it would annoy serious gamers in face-to-face games.

NAW depicts platoon level combat in World War II, using the World at War system. P500 price at $45 with 2 more scenarios (that would be 18).  Many of them are similar names you might have found already in other Lock n' Load system squad level games, e.g. Noville, Omaha, Vierville.  Some other places you are also familiar with include Strass, Remagen as you fought them in ASLSK or ATS. Lock n' Load seems to be spinning their games with more scenarios at different levels, e.g. platoon in World at War system while squad at Lock n' Load system.  While they might be repetitive to someone, actually you get to know more about these battles and how they were fought.

They did get rid of the tank killer mortars... now remove the jetpack ninja infantry and we might be looking at something closer to a WWII game.  The game may reward sound tactical play but not WWII tactical play.

Downgrade after returning to it after six months: I really dislike the "keep an end chit on the side until the formation has been" drawn mechanism. It is fiddly, easy to forget, and looks like a classic duct tape solution for a mechanism where luck is too much of a factor. The same is true of the mulligan chit system.  A game where I need a supply of multiple reroll chances to balance a scenario is a system that obviously is too luck-based and had to be reined in by the back door instead of addressing the actual problem.  Still feels not right in combat - the ease with which heavy armor is killed at long range by standard 75mm guns feels off.  

I do find it distasteful if a design team feels the need to shill the game with '10' ratings. Downgraded by an extra point as a result.

An amazingly simple yet fulfilling WWII game. Yeah the boards are filled with bogus locales and some scenarios ask for you to ignore rivers and such printed on the maps, but this one still just plays great. Even solo it's fun. The chit=pulls work well, and the scenarios are solid. 

Components are top notch look, but on lower quality stocks. But overall it's still a solid package. Enough complexity here to make it interesting but at it's heart is a fun and simple "buckets-o-dice" mechanic. I look forward to more games in this system (this and WaW series).

Had a blast playing this game. You can feel Mark Walker's influence on this one. It's a really neat platoon level system that is easy to learn and doesn't get bogged down in the complexities of tactical combat. I like that the game play was fast and very simple to pick up. Some of the larger scenarios (and point buy skirmish system) are very fun to play around with as the formations get bigger.

RATING: 7.5
tactical WWII is a complicated subject to cover but WSR manages to do it with relatively little rule overhead but plenty of flavour. The rules are easily remembered and administered and the absence of plenty of 'exemptions' is most welcome.

Some have complained that infantry move too quickly (citing jet pack infantry). I rather feel it is the other way around, a realistic limit has been put on vehicular movement so that all movement is closer to that 'cautious' movement you would get on the battlefield and tanks do not 'charge' around.

Being a buckets of dice game with hits and saves and chit pulls for activations, you can at times get some combinations of those things that can throw the game but again I feel these issues are over-stated, generally the system works very well to produce a good feel / narrative and with a good (read correct) amount of battlefield chaos, making the game exciting and very much helping solitaire play.

There are some subtle and cleverly effective mechanics going on, especially with regard to the disrupt marker opening the way for damage hits and the use of operations complete markers that cause an interplay between what to activate and what to leave for opportunity fire depending on what formations the enemy has already drawn (or not drawn more to the point). Very good.

each rule section is concise and effective, such as recon units, they get 3 simple attributes that make them feel like recon units and artillery strikes that is the most simple of things to resolve (take note some other games).

The graphics are nice and I appreciate big hexes and big counters. I have just picked up the Cobra module, in which the campaign game links scenarios in which casualties from the previous scenario effect the next game - very nice.

The counter mix is very balanced and generous in terms of the order of battle and unit types that you get with the base games. Nothing to disappoint here.

Bug bears are, the box is too shallow to hold all the goodies once punched, especially if adding modules. There seems to be some hit and miss things happening with production values. I had spotting on the back of my boards (came off with a damp cloth and detergent) and two boards are slightly miss-cut. 

My counters in both WSR and Cobra have been cut bang on, so well done on that as the counter information does push out towards the edges.

I think this is one of those games that could certainly become a gamers tactical game of choice. It is simply so accessible and nice to look at and fun to play. The designer has taken very obvious steps to keep a complicated subject very clean indeed.

This World War II tactical game is more concise than the World at War series that it is developed from. There are some nice innovations - especially the motorised infantry - which also improve on the design. There are a couple of minor oddities such as the markers, where the design is rather jarring, and the chaos table which seems a bit of an after thought. It's a great game, but sometimes feel that player decisions are slightly diminished by arbitrary rule processes like the chit-pull and the stand alone nature of the units. Quick, brutal and rather unforgiving.

Promising platoon-level WWII system - the rules could be a little tighter, but the support on CSW is good.  I didn't find the "ninja infantry" a problem if your tanks are properly supported by infantry, as they would be historically.  Still, the chit-draws and dierollls can be hell on the best plans, and the whole thing is more a fun shooter than a serious study.  But that just means it tries to fill an honored place in tactical wargaming, and it seems to me to be the true Panzerblitz update on the market.

Rating based on first few plays

I really enjoy the system. The chit pull mechanic is entertainingly frustrating! Random initiative for the various forces adds a level of uncertainty and tension. A situation in one of my games where the battered US Airbourne got a very lucky first plucking from the cup, which allowed them to halt a strong Wehrmacht advance just in time springs to mind.

The full utilisation of counters too is inspired. No need to check tables, simply follow the values on the unit counters - leads to much faster and simpler games IMHO. I hope some other games of similar scale adopt this idea in the future.

Only quibles are the limited number of maps (would hope for some expansions in this department) although quality and mounting is faultless.

Also a couple of typos on the counters and the lack of a certain unit chit (easily fixable though) are also a little disappointing.

However, having read several complex rule sets over the years this one took one reading and a quick skim and I was up and ready to play. During the initial games I maybe had to look up 4 or 5 minor things, but only as checks and not once did I find myself completely lost.

Intuitive, entertaining, deep, tense and relatively fast paced... All in all Highly recommended

Update - Downgraded slightly, system became a little tired, have sold and moved onto Panzer Grenadier - PG seems to offer so much more with added roleplaying and depth

My first wargame was Panzer Blitz, $8.75, and in a slipcover box.  Later, I added another copy and two of Panzer Leader and one of Arab Israeli Wars.  I still have them today.  I have been waiting for a good platoon level game to replace these for years and have tried other systems at this level but for various reasons they have never quite done it for me.  I think the Nations at War series will do it.  WSR has fast and engaging play, well done scenarios, beautiful LARGE counters, very nice mapboards, and a set of well-written rules; these all combine to make this a winner.  I know there are some minor production problems (mapboards cut very slightly off line along with a tendency to warp, still nicer than PB/PL/AIW) but I feel this is very insignificant compared to the excellent game play and pure beauty of the game.  I believe Lock N Load has much potential with this series and I am looking forward to Desert Heat and then wishing for an East Front game followed by one on the Pacific.

Fun platoon level WW2 combat. Buckets of dice thrown. I own both versions. 

Lowered my rating from V1 (7.5) due to counter mistakes/omissions , and errors in the rules. Kind of disappointed in that the art work is better, but the rules should have had a complete rewrite with index and glossary. The help charts are OK, minus typos but should include all the DRMs needed such that one doesn't need to reference the rules. Crushed text blocks with no spacing between words, repeated graphics displaying the same information and game advertising distracts from the rules.

Fast, light platoon-level WWII game. Quality components, easy rules. The World at War series has really grown on me, and NaW could be even better given the larger counters and excellent first expansion.

At least ( a bit ) funny if not realistic... Space Marine Infantry is still unchecked. The designer should travel once in France ( at least on a French map ) to avoid so stupid names on the maps.

Played once. We split 4 battalions (?) amongst 4 players and had a great time taunting and trash talking each other. Good, low complexity squad level game. Liked the chit-pull system over traditional I-go/u-go systems like squad leader.

Great playable game with excellent components (nice to see mounted maps). Slick game play without being simplistic. A nice successor to Panzer Leader :-)

Yet another attempt at a tactical/platoon level WW2 alternate activation game. On the surface a clean and smooth system, but once you get into it, it's full of holes and ambiguities. 

So much in this game could have been fixed, if the game had been playtested properly, if the designer would listen to critique and didn't pretend this is the first game of it's kind.

The designer must receive credit though for producing a game without combat tables, which will - with a lot of tweaking - make for a great tabletop miniature ruleset (which is why I tried the game in the first place).

RATING: 8.5
System very similar to W@W but streamlined a bit.  Fate points and transport rules are slick.  Clarification of hard vs soft targets and mortars are welcome.  I was worried that it would not have a WWII feel, but it did.  Nice big counters.  Color of German and US counters are closer than I would like.  Components are great quality, but I'm not a fan of the marker graphics (especially wrecks).  Wish the fate point expenditure costs were printed on turn record chart.  Overall, a great WWII tactical system it seems.  In fact, it may be the smoothest tactical WWII system yet devised and is a great value for the $$.  LnL's ongoing support adds to this value.

One countersheet miscut, box too small to hold the components once punched, some counters are hard to read - LnLP inexplicably continues to struggle with basic production issues. Blank pages and ads in the rulebook, too (sigh). 

WWII system ported over Eisenbach Gap, which was one of my surprise favorites. Surprisingly, it just didn't grab me like its fictional predecesor. Perhaps the wait between pre-order charge and delivery was so long, my interest simply waned.

Solid system based on the WaW series transported over to WWII.  Shorter scenarios but better counter quality both in size and font than WaW.  If you like WaW you'll probably like NaW as well.

RATING: 5
Do I really need 11 different numbers on a counter and multiple dice rolls for a single battle for what is supposed to be a simple wargame?  Lock and Load once again adds complexity/extra dice rolls for little apparent value or extra realism.  Furthermore, the use of End chits can lead to very unbalanced scenarios.  If the Germans only have 7 turns to take over a city and it takes at least 3-4 turns for each unit to get there (assuming nobody is ever in your way), then that only leaves a turn or two for attacks - meanwhile the US side is just attacking you round after round.  There are better games.

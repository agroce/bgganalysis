Where's the game here? OK so I've only played once but if I look back at my game I really do question what I would do differently had I had another country. I would probably have taken a couple of different actions and played a couple of cards differently but the majority of the game would now doubt have played out exactly the same. But there doesn't feel like I can do many things. I can play around with the politicians a bit but instead of doing that I can get money and get some assets which give me some bonuses but nothing really tangiable to winning. There's not really any strategy I can employ to help me win. I just sort of plod along trying not to be too obvious although it's not a huge shame if I am found out. It's just all a little too random and insignificant and it's 3 hours to sort of feel meh about it. ONUW seems to offer what this game is trying to offer in 10 minutes.

Just played this game at GenCon 2016.  I am a European History Major and my eldest son is an International Affairs Major and we both greatly appreciated the historical setting and design.

As a gamer I enjoyed the game for entirely different reasons.  I like the puzzle of determining how to advance your country's influence while not making it obvious to everyone which nation I was representing.  I misplayed numerous times due to unfamiliarity with the rules, but that will disappear with time and more games under my belt.  Lost to a player who I had successfully deduced was representing Germany.  The designer said their was a variant--did not read rules and the game we bought (the one we played since there were none for sale at the Con)--in which at the end before anyone reveals their country each player writes down which country he thinks each player is representing and then gets points for correct deductions and for successfully fooling the other players.  I believe we will add this to our game play at home.

All in all a very enjoyable game.  As stated above we bought it Sunday after they had finished all their rounds of play with GenCon ticket holders, and greedily brought it home to add to the collection.

Too random and chaotic with influence on the cards, two few actions to implement any type of strategy unless you're the type of person who just sees this type of game. I'm sure it's clever but really just for a very niche gamer type, happy to never play it again.

If I were to rate this game after my first play, I probably would have rated it pretty low. It’s not my typical game, my piece of cake. I was fortunate enough to have the chance to play this game multiple times with a patient, experienced player. I would agree it has a high learning curve, but every time I play this game, I understand it a little better. Every time I play, even when I end up losing (which is more often than not), I become more excited to play it again, to play better. Last week, I finally won my first game of I, Spy with one of the “weaker powers” (Austro-Hungary).

Here is what I have learned to love:

You may be a different power every time you play. That means you must play the game differently every time. For example, if you’re working for Italy, you’re receiving influence by Sabotaging other powers and convincing others to do so too. If you’re France, you’re Smuggling and possibly buying Assets in Berlin. The German Empire is making sure to play her Overnight Line every round. The game has a lot of replay-ability because of this.

You can choose to play pretty aggressively or passively. Even if you are not a gamer who likes going after your fellow players, you can still come out on top. It can be more damaging to retract a card out of your records, reducing influence for a power, than Extorting another player. It can be hard not to be dragged into the Espionage aspect of the game, but at least there’s always the Evade card.

I am rating this game a 8 out of 10 because there are a few things I struggle with still at this point. I don’t know if the Asset cards or the Politicians are completely necessary. Maybe in the 2nd edition, there is a “Family” version, like in Agricola, where you don’t play with them (This is somewhat hypocritical of me to say because I refuse to play without the Occupations and Improvement cards in Agricola, though some people say they are unnecessary). I also won my game of I, Spy solely relying on Assets and Politicians, so there’s that. I am also a terrible liar. I am usually found out pretty early on in the game. This can be detrimental to winning. It’s something I need to work on since bluffing is integral to the game. 

My recommendation is to play it again, especially if you had a poor first impression, like I did.

Very intriguing theme, poorly executed. 

Some of the downsides:
- The influence rewards for the actions as well as for the politicians seem to be unbalanced or outright broken for some countries.
- Other mechanisms are also interesting on paper, but totally disappoint in game. For example all of the cards that allow you to 'attack' or directly interact with other spies require them to be 'Tagged' first. Placing tags on spies is harder than removing them (You can usually only add 2 tags per action, but can remove up to 3 tags per action).
- You also need to be adjacent to another spy in order to attack after they have been tagged, which leaves you exposed yourself. So after a successful attack - unless you move away afterwards (requiring yet another action) - you risk being tagged or attacked yourself on the other players turn, basically negating your previous attack. 
- Empowering politicians is rather pointless, unless you are the last player to act in the scoring round.
- The game takes far too long for what it is, and has a lot of downtime, since you cannot really plan your moves ahead while the other players play, as most of the time the actions of the player right before you cause you to reconsider your entire plan. Additionally, the only way to change the game is through acquiring assets, which are far too expansive. At most you get to purchase two assets to increase your options and power by the end of the game. It's just boring to have the game drag on for so long without any change in pace.

There is a lot going on here, but it's structured in a way that once you get your turn options down it's fairly easy to play. Easy to win is a whole other story! Not knowing what country each spy represents add a great deal to the enjoyment of the game. In fact, a country could have the most points that isn't represented by a player. So, your never exactly sure what you're up against. Very spy like. There never seems to be enough time to do everything you want, thus forcing you to make tough decisions... I like tough decisions :)

A strange, and perhaps delicate, beast that I suspect I will rate higher with more plays.

- A game with new players will run long as there are a lot of options on each turn - 12 cards and 6 city spaces all give different actions. Once players are familiar with these then things will speed up dramatically, although I suspect a full game with 4 players will still be coming in just over the 2.5 hour mark.

- It's hard to gauge the pace of the game as well on first plays - the initial two scoring rounds are more about setting yourself up for the later rounds (getting assets, gaining control of politicians for the final rounds etc) rather than scoring points in the current scoring - notice that there are significantly more points awarded for the last two rounds than the first three.

- I would suggest always playing with the variant that awards points at the end for specifying everyone's alignment, as well as concealing your own, at the end.

Could be an 8.5 if it ages well.

A couploe of functional component issues -

- There is no identifier to sit in front of the player to say what colour he is playing - the spy marker colours do not tie in to the card back or symbols.

- The marker symbols are not distinctive enough and the symbols too small to see at a glance from the other side of the table. I have now colour coded all of mine to make this easier and have painted the pawns to match.

- The colour palette for the major powers is a bit weak - Britain and Austro-Hungary can be mistaken on some of the card symbols. Also, why couldn't they have used 'standard' colours for the powers - i.e. used the same convention as Diplomacy - only the Blue for France is what you'd expect.

RATING: 8
Excellent game, beautifully combining deception and social intercourse with solid decision-based advancement. Luck has very little to do with it, unless you consider another player convincing people that the country you are playing, is being played by no one.

I entered play expecting a far more typical clunky struggle through odd rules and overwhelming mechanics. I was very pleasantly surprised to be offered great complexity in a very naturally flowing game.  

For a first (early?) game, I expected far lower quality to the components and artwork. Once again, I was very pleasantly surprised. The artwork is great, and the names had our history buffs chittering on like giddy school girls.

I would have give it a higher rating, but I personally often turn to games where I can think less and allow luck to make up for my failings. Something I accept which BGG'ers are not big fans.

A very intriguing game where you must deduce who your opponents are aligned with based on their actions.  Literally all types of players can enjoy the game.  You can also force the issue by engaging another player and committing espionage against them.  Or you can try and play nice and go about your business without conflict. It's really up to the player's own play style, which is awesome!

The first game will take some time getting used to all the available actions, but after the first few scoring phases, most players get the hang of the game and it runs a lot smoother.  Future games also go much quicker after the learning curve is achieved.

About the game play:
you play 2 cards and either take a previously played card back into your hand or perform a capital action.  Taking a card back into your hand removes the associated victory points from being scored and also allows the card to be played again (Sabotage!).  Both are powerful moves.  Policitians are a very interesting part of the game and really put "I,Spy" over the top.  The additional level of unknowns about how each politician will affect scoring makes you wanting to control them even more; and there are plenty of differnet politicians in the game to add variety so no game ever plays the same.

Same goes for assets, plenty to go around.  What good is a spy without assets?  These are very powerful bonuses and add a lot of flavor to the experience and really make each spy (player) in the game unique.

Overall I really enjoyed the game after my first 2 plays, got the game 4 days ago.

I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys player conflict and intrigue and especially those who enojoyed the 1970's game "Conspiracy".

This is a very unique game.  I have not totally figured out the strategy (after 4 plays), but as there are no Strategy posts, I'm not sure anyone else has either.

Admittedly, after 4 plays, we are yet to play all of the rules correctly.  As with most complex games, it is best to reread the rules after a few plays to ensure you are doing everything right.  Hopefully my next plays will be even better than the first.

The biggest downside to this game is that it is pretty long.  I think it will go faster with experienced players.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

This is definitely interesting but I felt frustrated as people kept removing influence from my nation despite them not knowing who I was and my nation being last in influence and power points. Made the game pretty much impossible for me to be competitive. If people are invested into the game and seeking to deduce from each other's actions who might be whom, the game is quite fun, particularly as people tag each other and make each other susceptible to other spies' actions. I want to play this one again with people who are invested and who play fairly quickly.

My girlfriend and I play a lot of games, and this one has become particularly enjoyable for the intrigue factor.  Our favorite part has been playing mind games: Am I helping myself or unwittingly strengthening someone else's position?  The game really encourages table talk, and keeping everyone on edge.  It's also been pretty easy to pick up the nuances and develop different play styles.  I'm also a big fan of games without dice, so all the outcomes are determined by player choices, not chance. Good stuff from top to bottom.

This game is a Kickstarter but not a terrible one.  You are an agent trying to advance the strength of your country.  You also, are trying to influence various persons to score points or gain advantages.  You move around a map and have a set of cards that functions like a rondel or sorts.  You also don't know which player has the other country and you attempt to deduce this from their card play.  The game is ok.  There are some fiddly elements to the game, and it was hard to understand at first but once you get the concepts down it becomes easier.  I was mixed about my first play.  I would not have bought it, but would play it.

An asymmetric game with hidden roles. You travel around Europe and manipulate the power balance. You can see which nation is winning, but you don't know which nation the other spies are working for.

Very, very impressed after my first play. I had a blast even though I was last, even after neutral nations, for most of the game. Granted, this is exactly what I love in games and I would be content at this stage if it wasn't obviously broken or boring, but games like these make up for all the other average stuff I sunk my money into on KS. There is a non-negligeble amount of luck involved, but it I'm willing to trust all that 'bad luck' that happened to every player curiously in different areas of the game is actually the result of careful balancing. Unless a dozen plays show that the winner happens largely by happenstance once everybody is familiar with the dynamics of the game, the rating will most probably go up. What's moat i portant to me is that lagging behind doesn't deprive you of options or a shot at winning and that knowing the game better will most likely result in seeing the second and third bottom, rather than just simple optimizing your effectiveness.

Edit:

Two games later it become clear the game was sadly undertested and balanced evidently on games suffering from group thinking. Unfortunately if your group plays differently than authors', you'll find yourself suffering from skewed dynamic penalising one nation without any real means to change it. It breaks my heart, as I am still enamoured with the idea and the mechanisms work well; I believe the game could be saved by some balancing safeguards and that in the hands of a good publisher it could become one of my favourites. Lets hope for a second edition...

An interesting feature of this game is that you need to strategize both on and off the board, meaning that you have to convince everyone that you are not aligned with the country you are actually aligned with!

Secret alignment game about pre-WW1 espionage. On the beefier side for this type of game.

RATING: 8
This is a hidden role game that feels a lot like area control even though it isn't really.  In this game each player is assigned a hidden allegiance to one of 6 European nations.  Throughout the game the actions taken by the players result in that nation acquiring influence (or losing it) and during scoring rounds the nations with the most influence will acquire power.  When the game ends the player allied with the nation with the highest power is the winner.  So the goal of the game is to make sure your nation has the most power (or at least the most among the players in the game) while also doing your best to both keep your allegiance a secret and discover your opponents.

The main way influence is accrued by nations is by the actions in the game.  Each turn a player will take two card actions and may take a contact action.  All these actions do different things but they also grant influence to different countries.  So there is a bit of a dichotomy between whether or not a player is doing something for the benefit of that action or doing it for the benefit of gaining influence for their nation.  Perhaps they actually don't gain much from either and are doing it simply to throw off other players.  This makes for really interesting decisions as you try to bluff and also work out your opponents motives.

The theme is also really strong in this game.  Certain actions would give away your spies motives and identity and you receive tags for that.  Making contact with a spy in one nation grants influence to another, and many other things make this a strong game thematically.  It really does feel like the machinations of spies and opposing governments.

There are also several instances of special abilities in the game.  You can recruit assets that give you a permanent power as well as control and manipulate different politicians that both grant influence to certain nations during scoring rounds and do neat unique things as well.

With great theme and mechanics as well as being reasonably accessible this is a wonderful "under the radar" game if you enjoy hidden roles and don't mind a lot of confrontation.  There is a lot of player interaction in this game as a good number of each player's cards directly affect or attack their opponents.  One thing I do hope is that someone creates and sells inserts for this product although that seems unlikely since it is reasonably unknown.

RATING: 5.5
When a new player shows up at the FLGS, there's always that question about what type of gamer they're going to be.  Is the new guy (or gal) going to be a casual gamer who struggles with Ticket to Ride? Or are they going to be the Ameritrasher thrown into a crowd of Eurogamers, or vice versa?  

So I was a little hesitant when a new player showed up wanting to play a game I'd never heard of before.  The box on this one didn't give me any clue about what type of game it might be, and just going by the name, I was thinking it might have been some random game from the 70's... so I was already wondering how I could beg out of the game when I asked what the game was about.  

But as he broke out the game and explained that it was a recent kickstarter and began to explain the game, it actually sounded pretty cool.  I, Spy is a hidden role game along the lines of In the Name of the Rose.  You're an agent for one of the world powers and you have to work to advance your country above all the others, while trying to preserve the secret of who you really work for.

There are a couple of really neat things about the game.  First, you're playing two cards a turn, which let you take various actions.  But every card that has been played to your tableau will give cubes to one of the world powers. So if you want to travel, you're going to have to play a card that might give two cubes to Germany during the scoring round.  At the scoring rounds, you see who has the most cubes and give out points based on who has the most, secondmost, etc.  

So the game has a huge constraint in that you may want to do something very badly, but playing that card may have a huge impact on the scoring round that you want to avoid.  Additionally, you may want to play cards that give your country cubes for the scoring round, but you don't want to be obviously favoring your country. So figuring out what cards to play is a little tricky.

Secondly, you get to either take a capital action (if you're in a capital) or otherwise retrieve a card.  The capitals all do different cool things... but picking up a card can let you change the the balance of who is doing well in the scoring round.

The really really neat part of the game are the politicians.  These are tile cards that border the game, anywhere from 2-4 associated with each scoring round.  During the scoring round the politicians for that round are revealed and do various things, mostly affecting the balance of power among the cubes for the scoring round.  

But players have the ability to affect these politicians.  There are ways to look at what the politician will do, move them around, or simply remove them from the game.  These abilities are contingent on getting "control" over them... which means putting your chit into one of the three holes in the politician tile.  In order to do something to a politician tile, you have to have as many chits in it as any other player.  

In our final scoring round there was a scramble to switch out politicians that hurt various players, substitute in more friendly politicians, and just to get rid of some of the politicians favoring the other players.  This was a really interesting mechanic, as some players spent control to be able to see all the politicians coming up, whereas others locked down politicians so that only they would be able to move them, making them unassailable by other players.

The game is largely a race to make your country come out ahead, without tipping other players off to who you really are.  As the game nears the end, however, it really doesn't matter who you think France is, just that it mustn't prevail over Mother Russia.  The game has a little bit of an odd balance, as some action cards will be played more at the beginning of the game, while others are favored at the end of the game. So in our game France took an early lead, as those actions made sense early on, although France's early lead also made it a visible target, whereas Italy appeared to be doing nothing special, keeping to the middle of the pack, and relying on the fact that it's action cards would favor it in the endgame.

There's also a whole other part of the game where you get to "tag" players and then do espionage-y things against them stealing money from them (which can be spent to let you buy special powers/endgame points), gain extra actions from them, or just flat out seeing who they work for if they've got enough tags.  We largely ignored this side of the game, or at least I did. 

Overall I really enjoyed the game, even though hidden role games aren't my favorite genre.  The game is a little long with four players, although I think having more players is probably better in a game of this type.  

As it turned out, the new player was actually the game's designer, a hidden role he let slip early on when he offered to sit out and teach the game.  It was pretty fun being taught the game by the designer, especially as the initial learning curve was a little steep as there are a lot of cards and actions to learn/remember.

The only real quibble I have with the game is a wonky rule that we only learned as we moved into final scoring, which is that if world powers ever tie on score, both powers lose all their points.  So you can use the special power/points you've bought during the game to cause two of your competitors to wipe out.  I'm not sure this is needed and it adds too much randomness after a few hours of play.  It didn't factor into our play, but I'd be pretty PO'd if it had.  I'd probably house rule this out in future plays.

First, a full disclosure: I advised the designer on the development of this game. However, I was not compensated and have no financial interest.

Simply put, this is my favorite board game. It is on the one hand a fascinating game of deduction (like Clue on Steroids). On the other hand, it is a game of deception and bluffing (think The Resistance). And on a further hand (I HAVE THREE HANDS), it is a sometimes uproariously fun game of out-manuevering your opponents on a physical map ("I can't believe you stole my asset, you jerk!" ).

The game is deep and political, giving it enormous replay value. Moreover, I have found that everyone plays the game differently, so that I can still have the wool pulled over my eyes even after 50 plays (not exaggerating). Usually, around turn 10 or 11 (out of 14), I think to myself (or exclaim outloud) "oh, no, what if she's working for the French!" This is a particularly exciting element, because you're never really out of it as long as your identity is secure.

Every time you play, you'll have an enormous range of strategic options to choose from ("do I try to influence politicians? do I invest in a network of assets to make it possible for me to accomplish more in every turn? or do I focus on deception first and foremost so that I can sneak into the lead at the very end?"). And each of those options presents a set of unique challenges that I never cease to find fascinating. 

I give I, Spy an unqualified endorsement.

RATING: 10
A tour de force simulation of the first half of the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II.  Epic in scope and depth, it is not for the faint of heart or those who desire to see tactical interactions.  Even so, tension abounds in combat, and strategic planning is a complicated mix of resource management and risk taking.  As the game's designer has said, Steel Wolves-and its companion game for the Pacific, Silent War-are simulations designed for those who enjoy being the Grim Reaper's accountant.  A downside for many will be extensive repetitive tasks, but these are necessary to provide the statistically accurate results that are at the core of the game, while at the same time providing a combat narrative to the player.  But for those willing to put in the time and effort, it will provide an experience like no other.

This is a solid 9 which will probably go higher.  I've played 1 patrol game so far and will play some campaigns after the Vassal version is released. Many, many ship counters to sort and clip.  Different enough from Silent War to really peak my interest and time.

Just updated to a 10.  This after 2 patrol games, a wolf pack game and start of Drumbeat (smallish campaign).  Very enjoyable gameplay and components. 

Only gets better with the VASSAL (beta) version.

Playing the Full Campaign from 1939 with Vassal.

Takes the Silent War engine up a notch. The extra chrome is intriguing, but sometimes there's too much of a good thing. As an example Silent War has only 4 warcups to draw from, whereas in Steel Wolves there can be as many as 14! 

But all in all, I really like it, especially the various smaller campaigns offered "out of the box".

It's on the way! 1/2011
It's arrived and next on the table! :thumbsup:

Very :cool: game.  I enjoy this one a lot more than I did Silent War.  Game is play is good, options plentiful and you certainly feel like Donitz trying to manage your resources.  Of course, the best thing is when you find 4 little old loners all by themselves on the open sea.... :devil:
I've decided that I am going to record each month I play in a campaign game as a play given how long it takes to do so.

Update: decided to lower my rating as the rules for forming and making wolfpack attacks seem to discourage the player from doing so.  I might be missing something, but others have commented on the same oddity.

Meatier version of the system used in Silent War. The game has considerably more chrome when you take the political rules into account, which give the player a lot of choices as to how to improve the fleet and operations. Game still has the same component issues that Silent War had (no computation DRMs on cheat sheets or AAC drms), but that's easily rectified and otherwise the game is gorgeous, if a little crowded on the map. In full swing, this will take about two hours to play out a week by my estimate, closer to one if played on VASSAL with the much faster convoy set ups. Two weeks into the full campaign game and I like it a lot, we'll see if I can get as far as I did with Silent War (about two game-years). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Only reason this isn't a 10 is that the political rules can leave you screwed as written if you fail a few torpedo improvements and then can't score enough points to get another chance.  Since there aren't nearly enough political points anyway (even to achieve the historical results), a house rule decoupling torpedo improvement from politics - as suggested by one of the designers - is in order.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I still don't know how to judge this game.
In the moment it just feels too big to manage for me, especially as many of the smaller german boats do little rewarding. It's more a simulation than a game and you have to be interested in long term statistics.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fantastically detailed 'tour de force' by the Compass boys! A real 'step up' from Silent War. A 'heavy' game in all respects, not just the 12 countersheets!
Overall-seems to give an excellent feel to the Battle of the Atlantic, by mid 41 the Germans are having a great time, but then the Allies get into gear & escorts/technology brings them back.Sobering thought, only 1/4 of all U boat crews made it back home.

Incredible (and monster) game.
Comparatively to Silent War, Steel Wolves brings new exiting elements. Especially, the political decisions greatly improve the feeling of immersion into this conflict.
The main vice of this game is the time needed to fulfill a complete campaign.

I love naval games, and double love submarine games.  I really wanted to love this game, but it is a bit of a dog's breakfast.  Just insanely enormous scope and detail, which makes it border on unplayable.  I'll try it again sometime; probably hybrid VASSAL and real life layout, but man... it is daunting.

RATING: 8
Although Silent War is a bit boring in execution, who doesn't want to have a complete collection of the German submarine asset?  This game is really a book of living data - in that you live out the life of a submarine, not just reading it.  The game comes with a very nice package box like that GMT's Command and Colors: Ancients.

Components are beautiful.  I've played a patrol mission and two convoy attack missions so far.  Seems like a must-have for u-boat enthusiasts.  Will update rating once I've played a bit more, but looks good so far.  Rules very interesting, they include many historical event tables which have affects on the conflict, for example requiring some submarines to be sent in support of the invasion of Norway.  Not super exciting.

Want a moster wargame, but you don't have a friend that is interested in moster wargames?

1. option: Buy a monster multiplayer wargame and play it agains an opponent once in two years.
2. option: Buy a monster solitaire wargame and play it when you are able to.

Select: Option 2.

Somehow i have been very interested in WW2 era submarines in past years so the theme hits me like an torpedo ;)

I hated to figure out that I am only able to play this with Vassal without buying a bigger house with extra room to keep the game setuped for a few years.

I finally started my full campaign with Vassal at 18.4.2012...

£99 & a few odd coppers (incl. p+p) ..... I should have pre-ordered form Compass Games, but then again I may well have been 'caught' with customs duty. The pictures look good; let's hope it plays as well as it looks.

Sadly (for me) it doesn't.

Unlike Silent War, where I wanted to play again & again, despite failing to achieve the set target tonnage, I didn't find this anywhere near to being as addictive. It became a chore & I lost interest. One really shouldn't have to resort to using Vassal (as a number of people have suggested) to make this game 'playable'.

It will be a long time before this sees the light of day again.

I've been able to invest a little more time in this one. Commenced the Full Campaign (no Vassal) on 3.9.2011 [Rating increased due to better play thro']

Somehow managed to convince myself I really REALLY needed a U boot game.
So many components, drool, must have.

Finding it cheap really helped of course.
Wouldn't have gone for it at the Original price.

Getting the components ready for play took me days, but it was good fun.

Way too much stuff to track in this game to make it worth playing. It's an interesting exercise but it never seems to be very exciting and the results feel a-historical.

RATING: 9
Outstanding. The ultimate solitaire game. I have heard commentary about it being a simulation exercise, but imo there is enough choice to make to stop it being scripted, yet enough direction that it avoids going off-track.
I have also read what a pain it is creating convoys, but again I don't mind this.
Only issue and probably why it's not a 10, is the rules are jumbled - some in scenario book and some in rule book. Tables are on one of many handouts (which is a good thing), but when they are referenced in the rule/scenario book itonly rarely directs you to where the table is - usually when it is on the map.
This leads to an awful lot of unnecessary frustration on the first few turns.
Also I am not impressed that considering the amount of money this cost (and I understand the reasons why), it would not have been feasible to mail out the missing Prestige token. I am disappointed that after buying a £100 game that I am expected to print and paste my own together.
Having said that these are minor gripes and it is definitely worthy of a 9 - assuming that I can find some time to play more than a month!

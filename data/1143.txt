After two hours three of six players said, "we're not going to play this any more".  If you haven't captured a city by the end of the first round, the fate cards decimate all players (pulling 12 before each assembly).  There is little or no way to interact with other players when everyone has been decimated.  Without capturing a city there's no way to rebuild, and it's just a matter of time before you run out of money with little recourse.  Ugh.  I won't be playing this one again.

Rather similar in theme and play to Avalon Hill's Kingmaker. Not quite as good as that title, IMO. This game should have "jump start" rules for positioning players with a few cities under their belts already so that players can get right to the heart of things.

RATING: 6
One from my original collection.  Games were starting to get away from the hex-and-counter concept and doing some interesting things.  Maybe the beginnings of TI were in here, with the political cards?  Actually for all I know TI1 may well have been around at the same time.

Another Games Workshop game from my childhood. I've managed to hang on to this one somehow...

Due to Games Workshop's recent decision to force BGG to remove most files supporting this and other GW games, I have removed my "6.5" ranking from this game. I no longer wish to contribute to the game's ranking here on BGG.

one of me fave games. best with a minimum of 3, but optimally around 4/5! takes a while to get going but can be laborious if youre not familiar with the rules. great for diplomacy and backstabbing tho when youre in the mood.

This is a fairly simple but excellent multiplayer game, I've found that it work best with four or more players but is acceptable with two.  There are plenty of event cards and luck that can turn fortunes upside down.  It usually ends in a big shown down after a bit of customary back stabbing!

RATING: 6
Ah yes, a classic GW game pre-800 pound gorilla, "buy $400 of our minitures today and we will let you play with them for six months before we change the rules". Interesting game play, horrid rulebook. This is a very long game that I have only played through two or three times. I enjoyed each time, but they were something like six hours long. If the rules were not so scrambled, I would give this a higher rating.

Later Comments: I haven't busted this game out in what...? 15 years. I remember enjoying it, but it had a number of Games Workshop rules quirks that took away from the whole experience.

Haven't played it in many, many years, but my memories are of an over-long game with horribly powerful random event cards (the one/s that nuked your economy - e.g. a plague - while realistic, were the opposite of fun, undoing all the stuff you'd built up). Still, it was good at the time, before hobby games immeasurably improved.

Well, It was great when I played this in the eighties. 
In a two player game most of our units get killed, either from plague or uprising, so that we couldn't conquer or besiege any cities. We had to wait two more rounds until the assembly round, where we would be able to bid for new units. So we quit playing.It really needs some houserules.  I will try this once more with four people or more and maybe give it a better rating.

------------------------------
Original comment:

GW edition:  A long game, but an enjoyable one if you're into the theme, OK with randomness and chaos that may occasionally, fall on a player(s) like a ton of bricks.  

The game can sometimes (often?!) be capricious and frustrating... guess life in medieval times was hard.

Haven't played the game since the 2003, but it was fun the last time I played and the game can be enjoyable if you have the right group.  

Would rate this game slightly above Kingmaker.  Looking forward to the FFG edition.

Rating updated (from 5 to 7) after a play in 2006 (thanks Tony!) - Excellent fun!  It's well balanced and the fate cards seem to keep it open right up until the end game.  Most enjoyable.  Shame it's a bit of a marathon, but I think we will nail it in 4h when (if) we have another play.

Why is this a 10 for me?  You play a baron trying to take control of a region.  It has 

a) secret auctions for mercenaries
b) it has empire building ie more than half the cities wins the game, 
c) it has negotiation through voting for legislation that affects the empire
d) It has combat using CRT
e) It has random elements: dice and fate cards.
f) It has gambling through ships travelling around the world
g) Sometimes you need to change your strategy/tactics through the game due to changes in the game

House rule:  Turns are taken in Random

I loved this game when I played it. I remember this game putting a player in position to have to attack another player. He announced he was going to roll to see who he would attack. I then announced that "no matter what number came up on those dice, if you attack me WE ARE AT WAR!." He didn't care for my attitude and said why was I being such a bastard and I reminded him that some of us are actually trying to PLAY the game and that requires the players try to win. Needless to say this game is quite political.

I finally managed to play this game after trading for it almost half a year ago and while I was fumbling through the rules, the theme and game play is exactly the kinda of game that I like! There is politickig, warmongering and strategy enough to fill me for a weekly session and now after the first game I'm dying for more! Still if this old edition was good, I have a feeling that it might be worth while getting the new editon by FFG. Even though I've only played this once as of 13/5/06, I still rate this a solid 8.

RATING: 8
Have long loved this game - played many games as a kid, quite possibly without ever finishing one. Tricked my wife into a 2 player game and to my surprise she loved it - turned out this may have had more to do with the continuous runs of bad luck I had in that game, as she was infinitely less thrilled when the dice turned against her on a seceond play. 

The assembly voting mechanic for two players works surprisingly well, and keeps this a very interesting game. For modern gamers, the main problem with Warrior Knights is the randomness - but this is of course built into the game to reflect the chaotic uncertainty of the period - that an army may be decimated by plague on the brink of success. It makes a win extremely difficult to predict, but likewise makes the game more about the experience of playing than winning. 

The other elements of the game seem very familiar when looking at the likes Puerto Rico and even Settlers - and for my money, Warrior Knights did this far better in terms of entertainment and, well, beauty of play. No pasted on themes here!

A real classic game. Players take the role of Barons fighting for control of the Kingdom. This occurs on a few different levels; fighting for control of land, politics and expeditions.

Through the Politics of the game you find out who your friends are, as votes are cast to decide a variety of issues and it leaves room for a great deal of back-stabbing, (don't play with sensitive people!).

The best boardgame I've ever played.  Fantastically diverse elements, serious player group dynamics, add a dash of luck, it's got everything I could ever ask for in a game.

Very good game, and too long since I last played it. If it has a down-side it is it's lenght. Never played the new FF version, as has mixed reviews, but the voting for titles and positions works so beautifully, that this game has a lot going for it. It's very much alliance driven, with a great political edge, and a simplified combat means that you can get on with the main business of stabbing your foes in the back! Superb.

Beer and pretzels game.  I haven't played it in about 15 years though. But I remember the game being fun as long as you had 5 people involved.

It ain't perfect, but damn if it ain't fun. Longish, but whenever I'm playing this one I don't mind. There's warfare, an auction aspect, a political/voting aspect, and those damn fate cards that add exactly the kind of randomness that you could expect during the dark ages (ok, it's kind of a fantasy theme, but it ain't far removed from our reality). Play it if you can find it.

Damn, this is a long and frustrating game! I tried it three times, and in all of them, the game ended not by its rules, but because the players gave up. Not a good sign.

There are some good mechanics in [b]Warrior Knights[/b]: the auction of units, the votes for rules and envoys to far away lands. The combat can be annoying - the chart make sure that even a many times bigger force might not win (it do have a reason to do so, but in the game I, more than once, was irritated by it).

Anyway, [b]Warrior Knights[/b] reminds me of [b]War[/b], like an older brother, that, although it can be seem as cooler, it cames from the same place.

Original version.  Very enjoyable game.  Has similarities to Kingmaker without the expansive terrain but includes a very nice idea of a voting round.  The combat system is simple and works well.

Wow...this game is really, really LONG. With four players, it felt like the game had only just become really interesting after 4 hours of play. Two times we stopped after 6 hours of play, and there was no way of telling how much longer it could have taken for one of the players to win. Definite drawbacks are the considerable downtime, the vast amount of rules and the randomness (and impact!) of the event cards that are drawn each player turn. And yet...the game still appeals to me. Must have something to do with the interesting components and great atmosphere.

An old classic game that involves good diplomacy with the right players. Some of the gameplay is limited and the randomness is too much in some areas. Not played the new version.

It's a long time since I played this. It had some very good concepts, the politics, the sieges, bidding for troops, but suffered from the Kingmaker disease of going on and on and on and ......

As we were looking for an alternative to Kingmaker it failed to make the grade. Pity.

Bravo on a great game. I presented it to some of my friends back in the 90's and though they would not like it. Quickly we had about 10 playings under our belts but sadly have not played it in years.

I love this game. Sadly, the FFG redo disappointed me in all areas except component quality and art. Taking away the die roll combat I could have lived with, but all the other triggering mechanics and Influence stuff just left me totally cold. Traded it and its expansion away.

Warrior Knights is a great game if you&#039;ve got several hours to burn. Like the classic Kingmaker, and marginally more interesting with the blind bidding system to garner troops. (However, the bidding makes the game drag a bit.) I enjoy the game quite a bit when I played, but unfortunately the game takes much longer than I have patience to play. So probably I rate this game an 8 or 9 for the first hour, and then -1 for every hour after that. :-)

An epic from GW line of boardgames that has many of the standard GW traits: takes a long time, relies heavily on luck, fairly brutal gameplay. Still, a big hit with certain folks who enjoy a big slug-fest wargame. Introduced some novel elements that were fairly advanced for the time. A classic that screams to be updated.

I owned the original edition of this terrible game, and all of us hated it with a passion.
Components and board were average and dull.

I would not have reprinted this unless ALL other options in the world of games were taken.

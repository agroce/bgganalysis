RATING: 7
I'm not a great fan of abstracts and I'm complete rubbish at planning ahead and in detail more than a couple of moves, no matter how simple the game being played is. Nevertheless, I keep coming back to this game from time to time, due to its extremely short playing time, simple rules that don't lack interesting twists and the constant feeling that I still don't get it (and that another, last play could make the difference... and a more objective comment). Unusually addictive, at least to me.

It's Gigamic: wood, well finished, even elegant, more than capable of drawing the attention  of your guests. A couple of minutes to explain the rules and you're ready to go.

I like this game a lot. it's simply brillant. rules are explained in 2 minutes and if you become expert there is a harder version. It's very short and you can play multiple time. What i like about this game is that YOU give the piece to your opponent, so bascially you can only blame yourself if you give the wrong one(ok there is some exception).

RATING: 4
This sort of game doesn't grab me - seems too much like highly evolved Tic Tac Toe.  Unlike many TTT progeny, Quarto is at least thought provoking.  However, because your piece is chosen by your opponent, an opportunity to win is often the result or your opponent's mistake (not always, but often) and not your good planning.  When playing, I find I put more thought into preventing and blocking my opponent's opportunities than into developing my own.

This fun, abstract strategy game can be taught in 30 seconds and played within 10 minutes. It reminds me of Tic-Tac-Toe and Score Four. 

Received as a gift from Paul & Anaya.

A good lunch time selection.

Nice 2-player abstract game. Super easy to teach and play. Play time is about 10 minutes. Nice wooden components. Each pawn has 4 attributes: color, height, shape and consistency. The goal is to make 4 in a row with the same attribute. The 'you choose your opponent's piece' mechanism is a nice idea. Every coffee shop should have games like this.

Very nice game.  The quality of the game is great (except for the annoying rubber bumpers on the bottom of the game board).  The idea of possibly choosing your apponent's move is a nice twist.  I have played many rounds of this game and it never gets old.  Also I have played and been victim to being forced to hand over the winning piece.  I really like this game mostly because of the game mechanic of handing your apponent the next piece to play.  I wonder what chess would be like if you were to choose the next piece for your apponent to move.

Fun, very addictive abstract game. Rules explained in 2 minutes, plays under 5 minutes. I recommend adding that a small square of 4 pieces with a common attribute is also a win. I had a big wooden version of the game permanently set up at my desk. Management warned me against luring fellow employees into wasting their time, but I explained to them that it was good multi-tasking training... and I challenged them to a game while I worked so they'd understand what I meant :)

A colleague and I got into this game over lunch for a couple of weeks.  Looks nice, pieces are sturdy, and we were always amazed at how we always seemed to forget that one characteristic that sealed the deal for the other player.  Don't know how many times we each gave each other a piece confidently, and then dropped our jaws when "Quarto!" was called out.  We tired of it fairly quickly, but I can see sharing it with some of my other gaming buddies.  [Thrift $1.09x2]

Comes with the Gigamic plastic draw string bag.

I'm glad I got this game. You can play so many games in a short period of time. And with the nice wooden components, you can play anywhere without having to worry about them getting messed up. When we went to the beach, I just packed the pieces in a big ziplock bag, put the board in my wife's bag, and off we went. It's a nice game to have when you're relaxing somewhere and want to play something light but interesting while you talk. And if your game gets interrupted for some reason, no big deal.

Edit: It's a nice travel game, but for us, it often seems to be a game of who will mess up first. But still, a nice relaxing way to pass the time at the beach.

There’s something in Quarto I can’t catch and I’d need this «something» indeed to enjoy, or at least understand, this game: I just can’t see either the strategy or the fun in placing wooden blocks, chosen by the opponent, on a board.

Es un cuatro en raya, con la novedad de que lo que hay que alinear no son piezas sino características. El toque genial del juego es que tu escoges la pieza que tiene que jugar tu contrincante.

Abstracto para dos jugadores muy recomendable.

Le tenía especial cariño, pero no lo jugaba absolutamente nunca y no veía posibilidades de hacerlo, así que en junio de 2015 lo vendí a Galarth de la BSK, junto Dixit jinx que gané en lo del juego que rula, con entrega en mano en las clbsk a cargo de yamakasi (yo no fui).

This is rightfully one of the more popular of Gigamic's games.  Picking the piece your opponent plays is part of its attraction, but just as fun is trying to train your brain to not overlook a winning condition.  It's easy to focus on piece color or shape only to forget their size or hollows, allowing your opponent to call it instead and win the game.

I think this game is brilliant and one of my favorite abstract - 2 person games. The mechanic of choosing your opponents next piece is great.We played for years incorrectly and decided afterward that our rules were better.

That being... you start with one-half of the game pieces based on color. You are only allowed to give your opponent a piece from that set. It's more restrictive and drives the end-game faster.

It's definitely an interesting mechanic. One literally hands victory to the other player. 

However, it's one of those games where you can make suboptimal choices, but one mistake and it's over. Your victory is rarely because you outplayed your opponent, and usually because they were the one, and not you, to make a mistake. I'm not too big fan of games where one mistake is all it takes to lose.

Mijnlieff has a very similar feel, but without the flaw, a far better game.

The best thing about the game is that it only takes 3 minutes to play… No, I’m not joking, it really does only take a maximum of 5 minutes to play. Yes, we decided to play it rapidly, but we did think about where to place our pieces. It’s just that the first couple of pieces aren’t as critical as the last 4-5 or so. That’s when the game becomes slightly interesting as you’re trying to visualize how to place your piece and which piece you need to give your opponent so that you set yourself up for the win. This can be tricky, but to be fair, if you’re spending the listed 20 minutes on the game, I cannot imagine that it will not end in draws a lot of times as it’s quite easy to see what to do and not do, and that’s sad… I really feel that the game will end in a draw most of the times if played just moderately skillfully – it’s not a game in the GIPF-series or some other advanced game like those!

Of course I played with the “advanced” rules, which I think should be the standard rules, as they make the game more interesting as you need to take into account more possible formations of a quarto. The neatest thing about the game is probably that you yourself hand the piece your opponent must play, so if you’re not thinking it through, you might hand your opponent the winning piece! Quarto is way overpriced and way too simplistic and “shallow”, and even though it’s so fast I don’t want to spend my time playing this… The games in the GIPF series are much more rewarding!

This is a decent 2 player game, but features a board with only 16 squares. In addition, requires the four corners variant to prevent draws.

The wood pieces add to the cost but also add to the nice feel of the game. In general, it's a fairly old game, but still interesting to learn about.

I like parts of the game. I really like the "I pick, you place" mechanic. But it seems like its hard to not have a draw. Unless someone is a poor player or just can't see the 4 characteristics (which sometimes happens) the game never really ends with a win. Maybe with a very quick timer....eh.

A more complex version of tic-tac-toe.  The grid is 4 by 4.  Pieces are light or dark, hollow or solid, square or round, short or tall.  Players alternately place pieces in the grid.  The piece placed is chosen by the opponent.  Once someone has achieved four in a row that share one or more characteristics (e.g. tall) that player has won and the game ends.

RATING: 5
Good abstract game with charming wooden pieces. Quarto! is at its best when both players are growing a bit tired so that 'stupid' mistakes become an issue—you become your own worst enemy, and that heightens the playing pleasure considerably. Not something I'd like to do all the time, but certainly not something I am ashamed of to have in my collection. The rating floats a bit between 6 and 7, to be honest, but it lacks the depth you find in some GIPF-games, so a '6' it has to be.

[b]Update[/b] Never played this game again since the time I wrote the above comment (more than 5 years since), so it was time to draw the obvious conclusion and let the game go to another home.

Much more fun that I expected it to be.  The game doesn't have that sense of stress and pressure that a lot of abstracts have.  Even though it can require quite a bit of thought at times, the "feel" of the game remains light (probably due to the lack of ownership of pieces).  It's very fun to watch your opponents face as they realize they've been painted into a corner.

And as always with Gigamic, the pieces are chunky and a pleasure to play with.

Excellent and very quick 2-player abstract. It's odd because it can be a serious brain-burner, but even so it's a game almost never takes more than ten minutes to play.

Production: Great wooden pieces that are simple, yet effectively communicate their characteristics.  Play: Telling one's opponent which piece to play is a mechanism that I'd like to see used in another game; it is inventive, but here it just adds a layer of complexity to a game already mired in thought.  I game is certainly challenging, but with so many characteristics to keep track of, it felt more like a competitive puzzle (which doesn't suit me) than a game. (3+0+1) (1 play)

It should feel familiar to anyone who has played tic tac toe (noughts and crosses) which makes it a good game gift for non-gamers, (especially older ones who associate plastic with kids toys and wood with adult sophistication) and a potential gateway game for the right person.

Think of tic-tac-toe on a 4x4 grid. Now imagine that instead of you picking whether you play an X or and O your opponent picks for you. Finally, there aren't X's and O's there are pieces with four different attributes. They are either short or tall, solid or hollow, light or dark, and square or round. Anytime you can make a play that results in four in a row of *any* attribute, you win! So far it appears to be a fun game with tons of replay potential.

[Edit Jan 2018] I hate this game. :) My younger son beats me at it all the time. I played a series of games against a co-worker and lost over half. I don't know why I have such a mental block at this game. Okay, I don't really hate it (I own two copies) I just wish I had a better win/loss ratio.

Quarto is an interesting thought exercise and finds its merits in short play time and simple rules.  The gimmick here is that you determine what piece your opponent plays and vice-versa.

I suspect that the reason for this being the main point of the game is that if one were to choose their own pieces, nobody would ever win.

However, we found that with enough observation, we could get the game to a stalemate every time.  Such as it is, the game loses a little bit in merit if only because it can be studied and 'broken' in a short amount of time.  Meaning that the only way we could win is if someone had a brain fart, not because the game was allowing for much in forcing your opponent to a fubar situation.

That being said, it's not terrible by any means and I would gladly play it, but I think there's far better abstracts out there to be played.

An amazingly tough abstract, it would take a genius to catch every possible trap that appears in this game in a quick instant before handing a piece to their opponent. Replay value through the roof, as there is nothing quite as humbling as handing that piece off for an instant 'I win!' from your opponent. Playing with the advanced rules is a must, as it becomes near impossible to think through every scenario as you place a piece. Speed-Quarto will make your brain explode.

Quarto is a quick playing abstract that bends your mind the first few times you play. I don't know if there is any special opening move you should do, but at the beginning we just randomly place the beautiful wooden pieces and see what shakes out. The game gets interesting when half the pieces are out and you are trying to build/avoid traps. It's the kind of game that you should leave set up on a table and play when you pass by. We don't do that, so sessions are usually best of 3. I've won the game only once when my opponent didn't see a move...and to be frank I'm so bad at this game that I didn't even realise I'd won! :) My mind just does not work for this game. I am equally bad at Connect 4 because I just don't see the patterns and potential block/win cycle. I think that the planning ahead is what does me in. The best I do in Quarto is a draw and that is not good enough for me.

What a friggen cool abstract! Apart from loving the look and feel of Gigamic games regardless, Quarto really turns turn order on its head. Most games are won by a player making a bad move and their opponent capitalizing on it. I really don't like winning that way, so I usually play it out until the end to see what the "best moves" win would look like. This sort of makes the game a frustrating experience, as it can end some times in ties. Regardless, it's still quite a beautiful piece of board game art.

A game of beautiful simplicity that burned our brains as children. I remember we invented an even harder version where you could win by making a group of four pieces with a common feature in a square as well as four-in-a-row lines. Goodness knows why we thought it needed to be any harder, it's still a brain burner in adulthood.

I missed the game while I was at University so I made a Fimo version. Then eventually (in October 2014) I bought another copy for my collection although I've barely played it. I wonder if I still have the Fimo one?

My husband and I enjoy Quarto! as a fast, fun game to play between other games. We find ourselves laughing as one or the other completes a row in an unexpected way. I'm sure it can be played slowly and seriously, but we have a good time just trying to sneak by each other.

The components are a nice quality, and the game looks great on the table.

RATING: 6
A four in line game with the added twist that players share the pieces and you can make a four out of various patterns (small pieces, large pieces, color and pieces with a hole). You also choose the piece that your opponent will play and that makes you have to plan ahead for strategy to "trap" the other player.

The "choose your opponent's piece" is certainly unique -- I don't know of another game that uses it. It's a perfect information game, but not terribly deep so it's approachable without feeling that you have to study it to be competent. On the downside, victories tend to happen because of an oversight ("I didn't notice those three solid pieces") rather than tactical maneuvering.

This is a great game. I make people play it with me when I've only got five minutes to play a game. If they've never played it before, it's easy to do two or three rounds in that time. Of course, once they get into it, it's easy to spend much longer at it. It really gets fun if/when you get down to the last four or five spots open.

How could a short abstract 2-player game be any better?  Maybe if it had lasers.  I have been putting a lot of time in on this game recently with a friend, and it never fails to twist the brain.  A very good warmup for chess.  If it was much longer, it would be exhausting.  The perfect balance of straining the brain and limiting the scope.

Quarto is fun but all the action happens in the last couple of moves.  Super easy to end the game early with a mistake.  But otherwise the first few moves mean very little. Then it seems like the winner is a bit random.  Either way, a very short game.

RATING: 7
This little abstract game has you making decisions about what your opponent can do, as you select their piece.  It is an interesting twist on the 4-in-a-row theme.  My only concern is a tendency to have tie games unless one player makes a mistake.  

I have implemented this with IceHouse pieces, taking a Blue, Yellow, Black, and Clear stash.  The 4 attributes are:
Color (Blue or Yellow)
Size (Large or Medium)
Nested (Next smallest black underneath, or not)
Capped (Next smallest clear on top, or not)

A relatively common concept: four different possible goals let you focus on one of them and overlook others. Works very fine in this game; it is balanced and somewhat challenging. The materials are as great as expected from Gigamic. However, this is not likely a game I would play all the time, as the level of variation is necessarily small.

Despite its fairly simple components and gameplay, Quarto requires thinking several steps ahead for both yourself and your opponent. You pick the next piece that your opponent will play.  The beginning is fairly anti-climatic and it is not until the last third of the game that you need to plan.

I guess the Gipf line has spoiled me, I found this to be like a convoluted tic tac toe or connect four spin off.

Dont get me wrong it has painfully simple rules which is great, I just found the gameplay also too simple and too closely related to above said games, it has the same feel for sure. 

The pick a piece for your oppoent to play is great, but that was the only highlight for me other than the quick play time.

Of course its way better than either game I mention but really you are just trying to connect 4 pieces with at least one similarity in a line.  Advance rules are a must which means you can ALSO have 4 similiar in a box formation, raiting is for advanced game (5 otherwise)

I received this game from my gamer roomie as a wedding present. It is a beautiful example of abstract strategy. It is simple enough to learn in a matter of minutes but requires thousands of games before one can claim to "really get it." 

Its simplicity, however, can also be a detraction. It's quick enough to play multiple games but it can get boring. I prefer a game like Backgammon for two-player strategy but Quarto is always nearby on the game shelf.

I don't play a lot of abstracts, but I like the design simplicity / brain-burny depth of this one.  When I play on the computer, and I get toward the end, it is, "Ok, I can't give him a red, or a hollow, or a round, and there are only two blue left, so I need to...ok, what now? Alright, if I give him a large square one then...".  This game is a keeper, and I really like the play of it.  I suck at it but I really like it. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is a classic of the abstract strategy genre for a reason: extremely easy core mechanics yielding both interesting and challenging gameplay.  This is a simple pattern matching 4-in-a-row game, with high-quality wooden board and heavy, high-quality wooden pieces.  What makes it stand out is a rather interesting piece selection mechanic, similar to the "I cut, you choose" solution used in some game theory problems: your opponent picks the piece that you must play on the board when it comes to your turn.  At higher levels of play, it helps to think ahead as to number count of attributes and to think about seeding a larger field of possibilities, but the game is solid and enjoyable without any of that.  

Sure, at a certain level, if both players are high-skilled and evenly matched, you'll end up in a "cats" situation, with no one winning the game, more often than not.  But unlike tic-tac-toe, you'll still have plenty of close wins, and the ties will only make those victories all the sweeter.

One of the nicest wooden abstract games I know of. Has a Set feel to it, but more directly competitive. The best mechanic is that you choose a piece that your opponent then places and vice versa. Good coffee table game.

Pretty good quick abstract, basically tic-tac-toe on steroids. Can lose its appeal if both players figure it out too good, and games start repeatedly ending in stalemates. We'll see how long it lasts.

Plus you get a cool decorative element.

Very easy and intuitive rules, language-independent, nice wooden components and the cool twist of letting your opponent choose the piece you have to play on your turn makes [b]Quarto[/b] an overall interesting game that could even appeal to players who are not actually into abstract games. A set up game of [b]Quarto[/b] also looks really nice as table decoration.

The optional rule of also scoring in quadrants of 2x2 spaces is a nice additional rule for seasoned players or people who want to add more complexity.

This is fast-enough game, even for non-gamers.

It is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe (or Connect-Four), the nice wooden board is square size 4x4.

The average game time is about 5-10 minutes.

RATING: 6
A surprisingly fun abstract game. The wooden pieces are simple, yet attractive. (This is currently on display on my living room coffee table.) It's an easy game to play just once, or 3-4 times depending upon how competitive you or your opponent is. {7}

Cute little abstract.  I have to explore it more as it seems now that the best strategy is simply to avoid being cornered by being forced to give a winning piece to your opponent (and try not to blunder, of course).  I like the incredibly quick playing time.

Everyone "gets" this game right away.  It makes for quite a challenge though, since you've got to keep all the attributes of each piece in mind, plan ahead, and avoid literally handing your opponent the victory when you choose his piece.  A unique abstract that plays in less than ten minutes, with pieces that are nice to handle and look at.

Yeah, it's basically tic-tac-toe, but it's pure and perfect. I love to teach Quarto, and I love to play it. I know that every move is my responsibility, every loss is preventable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I am a big fan of Gigamic games as they gave me a great introduction into abstract boardgames.  Quarto shares many of the qualities of its colleagues; great production, clear concise rules and interesting twists in play.  However, whether it is my mindset or the nature of the game I was unable to get into it or to sustain my attention.  I believe the game needs a long session of playing for strategies and patterns to emerge but as neither I or my friends were bitten by the bug to play it repeatedly this is unlikely to happen.  With so many great abstracts available this will spend more time on the shelf than on the table but I will give it another chance and adjust my review accordingly.

RATING: 9
i simply am flabbergasted by the BGG overall score on this game. if you're not an abstract or logic game player you have no business playing (or rating) this game. it is logic in its purest form, where you literally can beat yourself, seeing as how you select the pieces your opponent plays.

Clever little abstract game for two players. Abstracts are not really our cuppa but the kids love them so we will play if asked. The girls enjoyed this one for a good couple of years before growing tired of it and picking Cathedral and chess over it. Loved the look of it on the coffee table though! Just begged to be played but now that we are done with it, Cathedral takes that spot.

In the long term, could be "solved"....not any time soon though.

The Good: For a limited number of plays you can outguess and out play your opponent in this abstract.

The Bad: Moves eventually become obvious and the game loses it's charm and playability.

I like Quarto! a lot, but for some reason it gets almost no play time between me and my friends. And now that I think about it I really don't know why. It's a super interesting little game but...I don't know. I think maybe there are just more interesting games that we prefer to play. I still really like the concept and the lack of control you have in choosing your pieces. It makes for a challenging and surprising experience.

RATING: 7
Rated after two games. It may become an 8. In many two-player abstracts, you make one mistake and you lose. In this game, you narrow down the other player´s opportunities, but while doing so you also have to be more and more careful not to set him up for a win. Very clever, quick and tense. Also, the build-up phase is very short compared to some abstracts. Definitively a buy if I can find a small travel set. In the meantime, I´ll make my own.

Based on one session (6 games).

The wooden components are top notch, as always with the Gigamic games.
The idea for the game is clever and simple, so explaining it to novices is easy.

I don't agree with other comments who criticize it for having a shallow strategy. Maybe I am wrong, but the analysis of the remaining pieces and an attacking game seems stronger than a defensive game.

We didn't have any stalemates, because after a few games lost by "blunders" and a game which reached the last pieces we switched to the advanced rules. I suggest to do the same.

Pretty good abstract, handsomely produced. Selecting your opponent's next piece, which s/he must play, is an interesting mechanic. As you're learning the game, you and your opponent tend to miss potential dangers, resulting in sudden, surprising wins. As you get better at the game, you and your opponent tend to see all the potential dangers, resulting in draws. Oddly, for me at least, it was more fun learning the game than being better at it.

The idea of getting a line of tokens which share a feature is interesting, but being restricted to the piece my opponent chooses for me is awkward and undermines the fun for me.

The game is fun, quick, and abstract, with an interesting concept, but the problem is that success relies ENTIRELY upon your opponent messing up. There is practically no way you can recover from one mistake. Great filler, though.

Lowered from 7 to 6 on February 6th. It's too easy to tie.

Fast connect 4 type game but with more strategy and depth. It's as easy as tic-tac-toe to pick up. 
I especially like the high quality build of the magnetic pieces.
Make sure you have a good bag to keep the pieces in, they are all unique and the game wouldn't work if you lost one of the unique pieces.

Basic mechanic is simple but clever, you choose the piece other player has to place down. Game is 4-in-a-row-on-steroids. Pieces have many features and only one of them is needed to make row of 4 to win. Fast to play every now and then.

Yet another glorified Tic-Tac-Toe from Gigamic. Nice wooden parts, as always. The trick is that there are no player colors; Instead you choose which piece your opponent has to play.

RATING: 8
The basic game is already very good (in a way four-in-a-row to the square... having the pieces given by the opponent is an ingenious twist as well), but there are still fair chances of a draw; aiming for squares as well turns the game up a notch again.

In any case Quarto is exquisite -the rules are compact, and despite the game being short enough to be played several times in a row, not a single time does it feel lightweight.

Ottimo gioco strategico per due giocatori, richiede molta concentrazione e attenzione, ma anche anticipazione mentale in quello che accadrà, un gioco astratto a scacchiera con bei materiali di legno. Uno dei capostipiti dei giochi della serie Gigamic. Della stessa famiglia apprezzo molto anche Quoridor e Cathedral.

I am learning that I really prefer story to abstract.  That said, Quarto is a really clever take on the "X in a row" genre that I don't mind playing -- probably because it is relatively quick to play.  Pieces come in a variety of opposite forms -- effectively big or small, round or square, dark or light, and with or without a hole.  But instead of choosing the piece you want to place on the board, your opponent chooses the piece you play.  Nice little twist.

A nice two-player brain-burner.  Sometimes (not always) I can get my wife to play.

But never to the point where it was boring.  And if I've been away from the game for a while, it's all fresh again (because I'm, you know, old).

Nice abstract game similar to "Connect Four" and "Nine Men Morris". Need to play this more to rate it higher or lower.
Update (01-05-2013): If both payer play agressively the game is a blast as many dangerous possibilites arise. But if both players play this game defensively than the game becomes stale and ends almost always in a draw. This is a real pitty. I'd like to give this game a higher rating but I don't think it really deserves it in my opinion.
Update (15-11-2014): I was shown a new variant which made this game SO much better. You win if you even make a correct 4 within a quadrant. This hightens the tension up to 11. Great great game.

Quarto is the most famous exponent of tactic games in which pieces are shared between opponents. In this scenario, there's only tactic, as soon as in any moment your position is exactly the same of your opponent's, differently from classic strategic games like chess and derivates. Maybe stronger players can find odd/even combinations that give advantage to one or the other player, but for usual gamers this is only a race for who finds the combination first, or even for who misses the combination as last. In this trying to solve a puzzle the game becomes often slow, and generally the loser is frustrated by finding himself lost, due to a single sequence, without any real personal guilt.
To add frustration to this game, generally the defender wins, this leads to boring games that reach almost the last move and suddenly give the victory to one random player.
Who compares this game to classics, like chess, checkers, reversi or go... doesn't nearly have any idea of what these games are, in terms of balance of strategy and tactics.

This is a simple, elegant solution for a quickly-playable, two-player abstract strategy game. Simply connect four objects that share a common attribute (tall, short, light, dark, round, square, hollow, or solid). The fun part: you choose which piece your opponent places (and vice versa). One can wrap a game in 10 minutes or so, and the elegant, quality construction makes it a great game for display. A deserving Mensa winner I recommend for children to play for fun, thinking development.

Elegant and very guick abstract game, unique in that you pick up a piece and let your adversary put in on the board. Five-minute games are not only possible, but quite common.

Bought this at a thrift store in Payson, Arizona for $1.  Fun game.  Better than Connect Four....but I still prefer Score Four.    Interesting dynamic that your opponent chooses the piece that you play.  The main tactic is that you need to know exactly when to "shut down" the potential wins.

I play with my daughter and when she loses, she gets to take back her last move and the game goes on.  Soon she blindsides me and the game is over.

So, this game appears to be degenerately stalemate prone until the end game, and then it is simple computation.  The best you can do is notice when you can win and make sure you don't hand your opponent a piece that will make them win.  Opportunities to plan even one turn ahead appear to be exceedingly rare until you hit the point where you can plan out the rest of the game.  You can't even do basic forking strategies that emerge in most n-in-a-row games, since there is no ownership of pieces.

I might be missing something in the subtlety of "choose the piece your opponent plays".  That sounds neat in theory, but I don't see how it leads to interesting situations given the rest of the game's mechanics.

The 2 big things that appeal to me in this game (other than being abstract strategy) are the quick playing time and choosing your opponent's piece.  A game that you can lose really fast if you aren't paying attention.  Others have commented that you can always play to a stalemate, which I suppose is true.   But why would you intentionally try to tie?  Because you might lose?  Bleah!  I would rather go for the win and see if my opponent can outsmart me :)

Like many other Gigamic games, quarto is esay to learn, easy to play, fast to play, but with some strategical view.

For me, the great quality of quarto is the way that your opponent give you the piece you must play.  So if you loose, don't blame the game just you... You give to your opponent the winning piece ;-)

RATING: 6
If you play Quarto! often with a friend it can become just a very tense tic-tac-toe and end in frequent draws; however, to beginners this game is a very good play seemingly full of options and possibilities. I compare it to learning to drive a car: When you first get behind the wheel there is so much going on it is hard to keep track of it all, but after many trips your brain gets accustomed to all the events and you can take it all in easily.
I'm afraid I've been behind the wheel of my nice, wooden Quarto! enough that it really just sits unplayed these days, but I can still remember those great, tense beginnings.

A játékosok fa elemeket helyeznek fel egy 4x4-es táblára. Az elemeknek négy tulajdonságuk van. Aki ki tud rakni egy olyan négyest, amely elemeinek legalább egy tulajdonsága közös nyert. Az érdekességet az adja, hogy az ellenfélnek kell kiválasztanunk melyiket elemet rakja fel. Így ügyesen kell előregondolkodni a játékban.
Jobban tetszik, mint a Quoridor, de ezek a logikai játékok számomra nem társasok. Komolyan gondolkodni érdemes rajtuk így elveszi a játék örömét az absztrakságukkal együtt.

It's funny how there is always one element that a player is blind to.  For me it was the hollow tops.  For my friend it was the height.  He was saying that his other friend had a problem wth the shape.  Overall a nice abstract game.  Looks good on a table.

This is a fast-playing abstract that is a nice filler, based on tic-tac-toe.  Because the attributes of the pieces make it so there are many possible winning lines, there's some good depth here.  It's easy to miss something the first few times you play it and lose quickly.

Easily my favourite two-player abstract strategy game.  Not as deep as Chess or Go, but Quarto can be played in fifteen minutes and taught in two -- major pluses when you find it difficult to get others to play abstracts with you!  The gorgeous playing pieces and board just add to the appeal.  Quarto sits on our bookshelf, framed by green ivy that cascades between pieces when its not being played.  Playable art indeed!

Update 03/01/09: Seem to be playing to a lot of draws lately with good players.  Doesn't help that I know it's been "solved".  Losing its lustre...

RATING: 7.5
Always take a game that has an exclamation mark in the title seriously.  You know you're in for an exciting ride!  Well, this game is perhaps a little short on excitement, but it's a fantastic little filler none-the-less.  Of course, the element that pushes it from good to great is the fact that your opponent chooses which piece you'll play each turn.  Now THAT's a clever twist, worthy of an exclamation mark!  The other 2 great things about this game are the fact that it's super-simple and super-quick, making it the perfect filler, and the fact that the lovely wooden bits are worthy of displaying on a coffee table.  Oh, the other great thing is that I found it in a thrift shop!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7.5/10

Sort of like advanced Tic-Tac-Toe: give a piece to another player to place, with the intention that they don't get four in a row that share any of the same characteristic (hollow/solid, round/square, tall/short, light/dark).

Works quite well but it seems to me that it is too easy to force a draw unless someone makes a mistake.

[Gigamic wooden travel (1991) edition] {Abstract; pattern-building, I-choose-you-play} Quarto! is funny for its 'I-choose-you-play' mechanic. It's not very deep but provides enough fun for families and children. It's a good entry game for children to understand patterns and calculation.

The game works because of the 'I pick you play' mechanic. Careful players have a higher chance of winning because it's easy to miss 1 attribute in the calculation. Besides, there are some plans to force your opponent to let you win the game.

Similar to other Gigamic games, the wooden pieces of Quarto! are very cool. The shape and color looks so fine.

Seems interesting, but I wonder if it's possible to get to the skill-level where someone actually wins because of good play. All games I saw where lost because of missing a potential four-in-a-row.

This game couldn't be simpler.  You place pieces trying to get 4 in a row with the same attribute.  But there's a bunch of different attributes so it gets really hard to remember them all and keep an eye on what is going on.  I think a nice copy of this would make a great coffee table piece.

Very visually attractive.  It's neat and quick.  It's sort of 4x4 tic-tac-toe, but no one owns the pieces and each piece has 4 attributes.  Tall/Short Dark/Light Square/Round and Solid/Holed.  A line of four of any of the attributes wins.  I haven't played enough to discover if two good players will always draw like in TicTacToe.  But it looks great on the coffee table. 2006/01/15

Quarto! requires players to place and match pieces of the same type in a single row of 4. There are 6 types of pieces; round, square, dark, light, solid, and hollow. The game has a nice amount of strategy to it, somewhere between the level of chess and checkers. It will definitely make you think.

Quarto! was another simple abstract game, but didn’t capture my interest the same way Quoridor did. It’s a game of trying to get four pieces sharing an attribute in a row. Those attributes are tall/short, dark/light, square/circular, hollow/solid. The trick is that your opponent chooses which of the 16 pieces you place, and you choose which piece your opponent places on each turn. It boggles my mind how to do well at this game, just like it boggles my mind how people can recognize sets sharing an attribute in the card game Set. I think I must be missing that part of my brain.

For an abstract, this is pretty good.  But, unfortunately, the clause at the beginning of that sentence, "For an abstract" means that I will rarely play this game, as I would rather play something with theme.  Still, this is an interesting game where threats are not limited to one player.  If you make a threat with your placement, your opponent, by the nature of the game, has also made the same threat.  As such, the game becomes purely about timing your threats and forcing your opponent to give you a piece which will win the game.  And the game is fast, so best-of-five matches are a great way to play the game several times to see who is the better player.  But, it's ultimately still too dry for me.

Quarto is an interesting perfect information abstract.  You give the other player the piece to play, then they play it where they want.  Games are quick, tense, and lots of fun.  The most fun element is having your opponent give you the knife you stab them with.

With the GIPF games out there, it's hard to go back to some of the older two-player abstract games and really appreciate them.  Such is the case with Quarto!, even though it's a decent game of trying to manipulate the board and your opponent in such a way as to wind up with a winning condition on the board.  It reminded me a little of ZERTZ in that you're trying to force the board into a situation where your opponent can't help but hand you the win, and while it can be satisfying to reach that point for the winner, it can be a little frustrating for the loser.  Still, it's a 10-minute game with some neat choices to make, and that has to be worth something.

I'd like to buy the full-size board. I really like playing the game. I bought Quarto Mini (thinking it was the same as travel Quarto - the shop assistant told me it was magnetized, when I asked). The pieces are ok, but the board will have to be flat and stationary. I guess I could have simulated this with Set cards. The game shop in the royal arcade will be getting it (check with them), and selling for $50. Might be "out of print".

Quarto! is a great coffee break game. Fast, fun and more than a little bit of a brain burn. Of all the big, chunky, wooden abstracts that gigamic puts out, this is probably my favorite.

Un jueguecillo curioso que le da un giro interesante a las tres en raya.
Para jugar cuatro partidas y descansar unos meses, mucha fama para tan poca chicha.

Very simple but clever strategy game. Similar to chess in that it requires seeing 10 turns ahead.

Gigamic, 1991 international version.  Components complete and in good shape (including the cardboard insert).  The box has some minor wear.

One of those classic minimalist games
that one can play with four year olds or 
forty year olds with equal enjoyment.

Similair to the line from Pin International
(Fire and  ice, Cityscape)
 it belongs on every Family game shelf.

Also: Gorgeous components:
I love wooden games:
especially ones with some Heft to 'em.

A very simple game with a nice twist. Plays quite fast, and for people who like abstracts it's probably a recommendation. Not extremely deep, so more of a filler than anything else.

Interesting abstract 4-in-a-row game with great wooden pieces and board.  Plays quickly and gives some opportunity for planning ahead and trapping your opponent.  Nice, quick, light game.

Another tic-tac-toe variant with its own unique twist.  Allows you to taunt your opponent nicely by controlling what piece they can play.

Beautiful idea.  It's never won with brilliance or lost on a blunder.  It always ends with a combination of both.  Nice.

A 2-players abstract game like chess. It takes about 4-to-16 turns per-round to complete a game. Best recommend to brain-twister players for a abstract game like this.

This game is a beautiful object and the rules are really smart and simple. My wife loves it, as does every friend that we've played it with. 

The only reason I rate the game this low is that I am so bad at playing it that it's usually not fun for me. When I got it I thought it was going to be something like a super tic tac toe but it feels closer to chess. It requires planning multiple moves ahead and I've never been great at that.

Quick game, 30-second rules explanation, but great fun. I like to play a couple of games in quick succession. Not entirely sure yet if there is more strategy to it than staying sharp and playing not to lose.

RATING: 7.3
Great quick game.  Connect 4 with a vengeance.  You pick the piece your opponent will play.  The pieces have four different characteristics.  You must connect 4 of any single characteristic.  It is a little brain twisting to keep track of the possibilities.

This game being solved to be a draw sours it a bit for me, and the fact that almost all my games end in a draw sours it a bit more.

I picked this up from a thrift store because it looked like an interesting abstract game.

Nice game, almost like Connect 4 with a twist: the opponent chooses which piece you play and there are multiple possible combinations of four in a row (colour, shape, size, solid/holes). And it looks good on the table!

Nice little (short) abstract with beautiful pieces. Looking to see what you and your opponent have left is as important as the board position. When it looks like there is a tie, the last few pieces can open up a victory.

Initial part of this abstract game feels random. It seems that a defensive and/or newbie player can force a draw rather easily. Mid and end game requires care and thought. Not too much fun.

It reminds me of Chess but is simple enough for players of any age or skill level to enjoy.  I don't think I'll ever turn down a chance to play this game, given how short it is.

This is probably slightly easier to play in real life (rather than against an AI on a phone), but it is surprisingly tricky to track all four attribute types and force your opponent away from a win, but to set you up for one.

Every turn requires thought and isn't obvious. I find the way this game makes me feel similar to Loco! Both present you some challenges on what to do every turn, yet both play out in 10 minutes or even less. A wonderful ratio of tension to gameplay length.

Debes lograr que haya 4 piezas en línea con una característica común (color, altura, forma, consistencia). El  truco está en que tu oponente decide que pieza es la que tú colocas.

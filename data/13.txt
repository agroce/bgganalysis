It has a good, quick pace, and works well with three players. Too much luck, not enough strategy though. The best part of the game is picking your initial settlements.

I was too young and/or too ignorant to get into this game when it first became all the rage in the mid-nineties. And when I finally got to play it, I just didn't care all that much about it - maybe it's because of the other, more refined games I'd learned to enjoy by then.

Bizarrely, my copy of this game, which I have had for over a year, is unplayed.  Instead I've played on other people's sets at a local gaming club.  Despite being quite a good player I have failed to ever win at this, and it is a source of personal frustration.
Okay, its got a large random factor with the dice and a popularity/shouting factor with the trading and the cards throw an extra random element into the mix, but I should win sometime, surely....?

RATING: 8
I would originally have rated this as a 9 but I'm bored with it now even with the numerous scenarios around. If the game lasts under an hour it's fine but you get the occassional one that just drags. However, I still think it's the perfect gateway game and will always select it when introducing newbies. I always preferred the Seafarers version but am quite happy with just the base game now. Cities & Knights tries to make the game something that it's not. Das Buch has some interesting scenarios though.

I don't have any visceral hate for the game, I just wish it didn't take as long to play. One thing in particular that I dislike is similar to Terra Mystica; the critical decisions are all front loaded in the game (settlement placements and early expansion), and there is a permanence in the area/point controls. Catan just takes less time is the upside.

RATING: 3
Perhaps I just over-played this one in its prime. Mostly, I just don't like games that take an hour and a half to play but you can often tell who's going to win in the first 30 minutes (or at least who is going to lose... but they're still stuck playing). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like the game but the only problem I have with it is there is a lot of luck involved with the die role. Don't get me wrong, I like some luck in my games. But this one requires too much luck in order to win. For example, I played my 13 year old daughter and son and we all kept rolling 9s all of the time, which gave my daughter tons of resources. She clobbered us, getting 10 points before my son and I got to five points. I bought this game expecting a lot more strategy and was dissapointed.

Edit: I have played this a few more times and, while I still don't see a ton of strategy in this game, I am seeing more possibilities. I think the expansions will probably go a long way toward increasing replayability. I increased the rating from a 7 to a 8.

Edit 2: I got Cities and Knights and it makes this game a solid 9 for me. We're having a lot of fun with it!

We were late to the game in playing Settlers and had already worked through Dominion and Carcassonne dozens of times before this one hit the table. We've played it once or twice, but with so many other great, and newer, games in our collection, there is no reason to ever play it. Still, it is one of the new classics.

RATING: N/A
My feelings towards Settlers are somewhat ambivalent. There are some aspects of this game that I consider quite ingenious. Not within the game itself but how works in a group of people. It's like a catalyst for social interaction and it doesn't take long for even the most casual gamer to really get into the negotiating and plotting of plans. And I love to watch new players as they starts to see their little village expand on the island. Their look changes - like something deep inside, something childish and playful, clicks into place. And I think, 'Now you're hooked alright. Hooked good and proper". 

On the same token it can get long, repetitive and frustrating - and you really need exactly 4 people to play it. My rating fluctuates between 5-7. So I'll settle with a 6 for now.

The Swedish Edition (Dan-spil) is rather low quality and the title involves one of the worst translations ever. Additionally, the Swedish rules are just plain awful.

The game that started this obsession for many people.  This was the first Eurogame I played, and I got introduced to it in college and played a bunch with several friends.

Unfortunately, I don't have much use for this game anymore because I don't enjoy playing it, my game group has long outgrown it, and I don't even use it as a gateway anymore because I have better games for that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
If I'm going to play a Euro, it should be exciting, and Settlers is certainly that.  The dice rolls really make the game--they let the drama of not getting what you need, of being forced to make new plans, rise up.  My only complaint is that you can be out of the game before your first turn if your initial set up isn't well thought out.  That is a huge barrier for new players versus experienced players, but the game seems to have done alright for itself.  Certainly worthy of its status, and I don't understand why it isn't ranked higher.

[I]tl;dr - The trading and resource gathering is interesting -- and it was a trailblazer -- but for many people, there are more interesting games out there.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Look, Catan got me into gaming. I can't deny that I've loved and played it a lot. But Catan (especially with no expansions) just isn't interesting anymore. I have played it upwards of thirty times online against AIs, and as such I'm pretty much played out on the game. Diversify your hexes, go for largest army or longest road (whichever has less competition), and trade only as much as necessary. Spread out and diversify your resources early, then bulk up on cities mid-game. I don't know, strategies vary, but I just feel like I'm always playing Catan on rails. It feels solved. 

So yes, Catan is a great gateway game. It's exciting for new players who've never played a German-style game before. But I don't need to buy the game, or its expansions -- there's no need to. I've got plenty of other games that scratch that itch, and while I'm happy to recommend it, there's no need for me to personally own it.

My first impression is: this is the best family game in 20 years and that's before I even knew about BGG! After my eyes have been opened wide by BGG, I would still say this' the best family game in 20 years (over the likes of Monopoly, Scrabble, Risk) but my attention was diverted to those of Puerto Rico, Twilight Imperium III, and Android...
Thus I brought down my grading for Catan to 8 from 10 as I would like to try out the others first (and the BGG grading is based on willingness to play). But my impression remained the same for Catan: it's the best family game in 20 years!

This was my introduction to European games, and it still stands as one of the very best.  Short enough to get played often, but long enough to be satisfying.  Simple enough to teach casual gamers to play (and they like and understand it), but still a very engaging and fun game.  Has lots of decision making and player interaction, and requires a good mix of luck, strategy, and trading.  Loving civilization-type games, I really like the way this one plays.

Also, I made my own board, which makes it look awesome:

One has to give credit for Catan for being a groundbraking game that paved the way for what modern boardgames are today. There is something appealing in the the theme, but games have evolved tremendously in the last decade and while groundbraking in the 90's, Catan simply falls short these days.

Simply put, I find Catan to be an awful game of dice-rolling randomness that takes way too long to boot. It looks nicer than Monopoly, but gameplay-wise the latter is better.. and that's saying a lot, since it's not much of a game either. As a family game Catan might be passable, but it creates so much frustration that I doubt it would be much fun. 

Even the iPhone app is waste of money.. I would not play it unless I wanted to piss myself off on purpose.

A classic. The one drawback I can think of is that the luck of dice (especially if 7 is thrown repeatedly) can swing things uncontrollably towards one player. Better might have been to let 7 be some other action, and make the robber a less common roll, like 2 or 12, say. The 3-player game works much better than the 4-player because in the 4-player one player always gets locked out with no choice but to twiddle their thumbs.

I love this game, there are so many strategies and so many ways to win that the replay value is virtually limitless. Radmonization of the game board ensures you will pretty much never play the same game twice.

This has become a new staple during family holidays & birthdays, everyone always asks to make sure I brought it.

A great interactive and social experience. Easy to teach and hilarious when you both swap the same cards (i.e. wood for wood) with a fellow player as you have asked for the resource in the wrong way for the umpteenth time. Great re-playability and the fishermen mini-extension balances the non-harbour costal settlements. A great family game and a classic. Would have loved to have played this in 1995 when it was released - the UK was just not as exposed to these "euro" games for some reason. If my mum will play and enjoy this game, trust me, ANYONE will.

Although it doesn't look like it, Settlers is the modern day Monopoly in success and play.  The game has you roll two dice in order to grab resources and there's also a lot of negotiation in it too.

That being said, there can be a chance that a player gets hosed because of unfortunate set up and die rolls, which makes this game far from perfect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably my favorite "casual" game and one that I always recommend to newbies.  For people that prefer a "skill" game, the dice rolls can be extremely frustrating.  In a game with skilled players, it often comes down to who got the right rolls at the right time.  Even the best player/strategy cannot recover from a resource freeze that lasts several turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Catan seems to get a lot of bad press, but I can't for the life of me figure out why, I think it's great.

It's got such good player interaction - its not just the quantity but also the type: all of the trading, blocking, and the robber  aspects of it create this "screw you" kind of atmosphere that always seems to create really good banter around the table.

It's a good game to play with a range of levels of experience of gamer. The randomness of the dice rolls takes away a lot of the potential for a more experienced player to just crush weaker players, and means that even when you're losing you feel like "maybe in the next few turns several people will roll a 2, and my fortunes will change!"

I absolutely love this game. My personal favorite of the millenium. I have introduced countless people to Euros through this game, and only a handfull have not enjoyed themselves. When I think about Eurogames, I think about Settlers of Catan.UPDATE: I finally have grown a little weary of Settlers. It is an amazing game, for sure, but I realize that there are many more games out there to be discovered. I'll still play it gladly if requested, but will probably push for Cities and Knights over the basic game. I do, however, give in to the fact that Settlers is the biggest deal as far as my board gaming history goes, and for that reason it now gets a 10, even though I'm a lot less likely to play it.

Catan was the first modern board game I ever played. Easy enough to learn, but the very first move is a critical decision. I would rate it even higher, if it didn't have a tendency to drag on & such an excessive amount of luck.  I typically play this game with people new to board games and the long length often causes them to lose interest in the game before we finish. I still like it on occasion, though! My copy has only been played once.

A fun, light game combining several of the elements that I like. The random element can be problematic but the use of 2 dice keeps the probability curve flat enough for the most part. Easy to pick up and makes a great family or lunchtime game, though after a while your group may want something meatier.

[update]After moving on to meatier games myself and revisting this one, the flaws in this game are more readily evident. The random element of the base game is far too prominent for my tastes. Still probably a good "gentle" introduction for others into more complex games.

As with many other gamers, Catan introduced me to the world of designer board games. It was a huge hit with my friends, my roommates, my family, and even me. I say this because I rarely desire to play it.

I've become Cataned out, most likely because I've moved on to greener pastures (with other sheep). My tastes in games have become more clear and I've developed a palate that is more defined, making Catan slip in my regards. Add to that the fact that my brother always wants to play Catan and I've become a little burned out on it.

However, it's a classic, both in the history books and in my mind. I've played enough games to realize that Catan is still one of my favorites, despite my hesitance to play it sometimes. I'm more willing to try new things and introduce a friend or family member to a game that is perhaps a little more thrilling or deep or thematic. All that said, Catan is a splendid game.

This game gets a 9+1=10. Here's why:

Not only is Settlers fun to play (the expansion availability bumps it from an 8 to a 9), but it is an amazing gateway game.  This is a real game that I can get non-gamers to play.  The existence of this game has saved me from playing annoying party games with non-gamers time and time again, hence the "+1".

RATING: 6
6+ plays, 3-4 players (base game). 6 players (base & expansion)
LIKE: the resource harvesting and trading
DISLIKE: Some randomness. The robber bugs me. The game can get hostile and too long with 6 players. Low production on a turn can lead to frustration over time.
OVERALL: Solid game, can be fun. Great player interaction.

UPDATE: I am now against the expansions. The base game is good, but with 4 players, one player can get blocked out from the precious coast. Sometimes there are turns when a player cannot do anything (no production, robber, monopoly, etc), so this makes the 5-6 player versions horribly long and tedious. (downrated)

El gran clásico, gana muchísmo con las expasiones / variantes. El juego básico a la larga aburre bastante al ser tan dependiente de la suerte y tan caótico, no te deja mucho espacio para planear estrategias con jugadores avanzados, quien esté bien posicionado en fichas de numeros altos de probabilidad, o combos con puertos, o consiguiendo muchas cartas de progreso tiene gran probabilidad de ganar, aunque con la suerte ya se sabe. Sin embargo es un juego que ha envejecido bien y sigue creando adeptos y es emocionante en los torneos!

I just hate this game, it feels so superficial with trades that are just so uninteresting and pointless choices. I have never felt like I wasted as much time as I do with Catan. The only reason I would play this is if my friends don't want to do or play anything else, and then it is purely for their company, with no real engagement with the game on my part.

I know its supposed to be excused for its bad mechanics and little depth because it is a gateway game, but I can name so many games that can show people what games are really capable of with just as little complexity. Even party games would do a far better job than this.

The Emperor's new clothes?  Well, I reckon it feels like that.  

To me, this is the gaming equivalent of Morrisey's music.  Many friends are telling you that it's wonderful, but it just grates, feels like the dirge that the old cow died of, and bores the pants off of you.  

There's really only one so called "Classic Euro" on this Forum that I just don't like and this is it.  What on earth is all the fuss about!  I just found it dull and too luck based.  I can understand why some would say it was a good introduction to German Games, but it has been surpassed by many others.  Lost Cities is much easier and more elegant, Ticket to Ride is vastly superior, easier, better made and more fun.  If you want to place things, then there are much better games.  If you want depth you've got games like Wallenstein.  Then there's the quality of the components (mediocre at best).  So what gives?  It's palpably not the worst game in the world, but, for the above reasons,  it's not for me I'm afraid.

Played Settlers again, as part of a team with my husband against other people at the Ballard Library Board Game Night.  And we utterly demolished our competition.  So, some of the players were close, but we made the best trades and had the best strategy.  We won with the longest road (no surprise for me) and it was the first time my husband and won, so that was awesome.  All in all it was a good night!

Played this at the Library again, and without mercy, I stomped my opponents, dividing them with my longest wall, creating a wood monopoly, and making some very smart trades.  My husband was almost tied with me - it was an extremely competitive and very close game.  It was great!

The great level of luck involved in this game make it frustrating.

There is also a plaguing problem of runaway winner which causes the end-game to almost always become an agonizing drag.

Unless my gaming group really wants to play Catan, I will most likely never play again.

To me, Settlers of Catan is the best game ever made. The base game is just what the name says: a basic game, originally designed way more complex.
As it is, it is already a lot of fun. The varying game setup takes care for fun for quite a while.
But the real strength of Settlers lies in its multiple expansion. 
Moreover, Settlers provides a wonderful platform to create own scenarios, and this is where the real fun starts.
Settlers is the type of game that you don't get tired of. If you do, just vary it and it is an entirely new game. Up to now, I haven't met anyone who doesn't like it.

[3-6] This was the game that reintroduced me to board gaming. After reading an article describing its mechanics and how it helped to popularize Euros in America, I was hooked. The pace is perfect, the strategy is there, and the balance is great. Some people fault the game for very basic play but I think that's the game's genius. A great classic!

Very fun game to play and easy to learn for many ages. The game says it's an hour long but our first couple plays have gone over 1 1/2 but that may be due to lack of knowledge of the rules. (Updated the rating from 9 to 8.2 due to game length not really changing. Tends to drag on at times though still a enjoyable game overall. Really like to play it, but not a game I would play on a weekly basis 6/9/2014)

The dice are WAY too important in this game for it to be fun. What little does not come down to the dice rolls comes down to politics (trading, placing thief).

It is too brutal when games just don't go your way... 5s never get rolled, when they finally do you get hit with a 7 on your turn and discard almost all of those cards you just picked up.

Not fun.

The more I play other games the less I like Catan. This game is not fun when you are crushing everyone and not even playable when you're doing bad.

its a very, very cool game indeed. working your way to victory means being very friendly but also deceive your opponents by either bringing then of the track with trading or by offering then what they need to simply build a street whilst you can get the final victory point with that city your going to build right away.

swearing and being an aggressive or arrogant derp doesn't really help your game plan so I think being polite and friendly during the game gives you the best game experience.

there are some cons though.

there is little fun playing against people who don't have a lot of experience playing strategy games.
settlers of catan requires some sort of foresight into what's going to happen on the board to make it the silently competitive game it is meant to be.

Very good game - dice adds a good random element, yet strategy more often than not wins in this game.  Random board is a cool feature.  Sometimes it can drag on a little long, and that&#039;s why I will have to limit it to an 8.  Unlike some games, I am glad this one is over when I&#039;m done because near the end it is kind of predictable.  Maybe also because I&#039;ve played it so much, it&#039;s gotten kind of old.

The 800-pound gorilla of board games!  I really can't say much bad about Settlers.  The dice-rolling doesn't overshadow the deeper, more strategic nature of the game.  The random layout of the tiles (at setup) and the random arrangement of the outside trading bonuses provides tons of replay potential.  The development cards are a nice mechanism for sprucing up gameplay and provide more options.

My only criticism is that Settlers isn't very heavy/deep and I tend to prefer heavier/deeper games.  It falls into that nebulous middle category – not too heavy and not too light.  But it's Settlers and it's fun and I hope I get to play more games of it in the future.

And no Settlers review would be complete without the obligatory "I've got wood for sheep."  There, I said it.  Happy?

Still one of my first choice to introduce the boardgaming world to occasional tourists.

Pretty much tied with Boggle for my favorite game. Settlers has so much room for change with the unique board for every game, and the complete arbitrariness of luck on the dice roles that I almost never get tired of playing. The game is great both for 3 or 4 players, with each situation providing for a very different kind of game. It's also possible to combine two sets of the game to play with 5-7 players (though I wouldn't recommend going over 6), and without needing to buy any of the expensive expansions. Every time I introduce a friend to this game, they get hooked by about half-way through the first game. Settlers is a great strategy game which doesn't rely solely on brute force and has no military based. Rather, one relies on trading resources as well as timely and intelligent use of them buy, barter and build one's way to victory. Highly addicting, but you'll never regret getting hooked!

Well, everybody says that we all need to know the classics. So here I was learning the classic Catan. It would be a hell of a game if I didn't know any other games other than Risk or Monopoly. But knowing so much games nowadays makes this game a bad choice for gateway. There are so much better games to show as gateway. The luck in this game bothers a lot and I can see expert gamers hating this game simply because there is no logic in negociate with someone that is winning, and this guy will be frustrated 'till he is not winning anymore.

I understand the value of this game in the time it showed up, but nowadays we have so much better games.

Still perhaps the best gateway game.  I had a pretty standard wargames+RPGs teen period, left games behind a couple of years later, and then came back to modern gaming a decade or so later after a game of this.  Sure the luck is there, but this is an absolute cracker of a family game.

The iconic Eurogame. Gather goods and trade them to build roads, settlements, cities, and purchase development cards. It's not my favorite game, but it's very popular. I greatly prefer with with 4 players.

Maggie and I played the two-player variant at:
http://nick.borko.org/games/Catan2Players.pdf

Ah, Catan. A game every gamer should love for putting board gaming on the map, and a game every gamer should hate for being such a bad game. I know, nostalgia is a strong thing, and this game was the 'only' real game back in the days, but that doesn't take away the fact that the mechanics of the game (maybe theme too, but since it is a euro, let's not take this into consideration) are terribly old-fashioned. Lots of better games out there!

After 5 to 10 plays

Simply BORING! It might be the design, it might be the unattractive setting, but for me it's one of the most overestimated games ever. It's too much luck based and even if I won every game we played I still don't like it. I was careful not to let my feelings slip while i explained the rules to my friends and they didn't like it either. Maybe we are wrong for the Settlers, maybe they are wrong for us. Still...

Fair game, but it's not one we'd play over something like "Carcassonne"

 A reasonable primer for non-gamers, and certainly better than monopoly. The 'Luck' and the 'Robber' can get very annoying, and the 'Longest road' seems perhaps a little good.

Pleading people to trade is the best. I'm pretty okay at this game among my friends because 1. I make frequent offers and sometimes my friends make suboptimal trades to me. 2. I have a great time when my friends gang up on me the next game and I lose a horrible defeat.
This game does not warrant expansions for me though, since I assume Cities and Knights is a longer game, and Pirates is just expensive. Base game is fine since I can find a playable copy anywhere I go.
Edit: I prefer 5-6 players to 4. More interesting group dynamics that way

A classic full of merits, great introductory game for the negotiation mechanism (one I'm not fond of), It might be a little long with 4 players, but it is fun enough to keep you engaged.

One of the first games that I started playing.  Players tries to collect resources based on the dice rolls and the houses built on the resource tiles.  With the resources, players can build houses, roads, upgrade houses or buy event cards. Players can trade resources among themselves or with the boardgame so as to acquire resources they lack.  Players can also move a bandit piece which will disallow players to collect resources from the resource tile if the dice roll number 7.

Good points: Easy to play and understand

Bad points: The key of the game resides on the initial position of the 2 houses players placed on the resource tiles.  If 1 player can get resources almost every round in the game, then the player have a high chance to win the game.  The bandit to stop the winning player from taking resources has too small effect on the winning player.

It is difficult to give a comment to a mythical figure, the grandaddy, the best in the last 10 years. I could be influenced in both directions: either by the reputation or by the fact that I could expect much more from it.

But differently from that guy my final rate is: good game but too much dice-dependent!

The perennial game - a classic. My game group played countless games over the years, before we even heard of BGG. We've had marathon gaming nights lasting until dawn. We even keep a game log (complete with questions/answers to complex game situations and a list of winners).

Even though SoC is a dice game with a med-high luck factor, my group believes that you can effectively strategize and change tactics depending on what's rolled and what resources people have. Why build a settlement on the 8 or 9 when the 10 or 11 is hot? What do you do when 3 is rolled 3 times in a row and the 6 hasn't been rolled all game? Where's the best place to put the robber, on a hot number or a more likely number? 

The player interaction level is fairly high too. Screw someone too early in the game, you have an enemy working against you. If you take the lead too early, you're a marked player. We love to talk during trades too (look, my sheep is better!). And perish the thought of trading someone with 7+ points, you'll be heckled for the rest of the game. Oh look, so-and-so has all those development cards, must be victory points, they are in the lead! Hours of fun!

I rate plain SoC higher than the expansions because it's fast-paced and easy, and we can get in multiple games in a night. Also, SoC games are typically close games where everyone has an active role. Even if it's a blowout, it's usually quick and painless. 

Played SoC dozens of times before I started tracking my games played (approx. 50-100 games).

UPDATE: Finally played this again after a long hiatus. We started with the sample board and starting positions to even out the board for the 2 new players. Turned out, the sample board was awful - poor settlement and road placements that didn't make sense (for example, some second round choices settlement and road placements would have been better in other places). 

New version: Flimsy board pieces, ports are permanently set on border pieces, but they don't sit well to frame the hexagonal board. 

Tracked on family list (grooven)!

Warm and fuzzy. Catan is a good game for beginners but is mainly based on luck. Best part of Catan is undeniably trading. Besides this is a very easy game to learn.

Our first game, 5 players, only 1 had played before, with the City and Knights expansion. The game is fun, but last a bit long. However, this is now on my wish list. For us, though, I will want the C&K expansion for sure!

Played MANY 2 players variant game and increased my rating from a 7 to a 9. I guess that 4 is probably the best number, more is not better in this case. IMO.

Traded for this game. THANKS! :D

A classic, definitely! A good game, no question! But, this can also be a very frustrating game. If you get unlucky in your initial placement and/or if the dice just aren't paying attention to the calculated odds and/or that damn robber just won't leave you alone, then the game can drag on for what seems like forever with you not having a chance of winning.

Just not all that fun to me. No tension, no intellectual stimulation, and I feel like I'm doing the same thing each and every turn. I didn't mind Settlers at first, but every time I play it lately, it just disappoints.

My first "serious" game that introduced me to a new level of boardgames. I enjoy Settlers very much - the strategy and the edge. I like the interaction of the negotiating too. But the luck factor can hanker down on getting certain resources, and if no one else gets that resource either, it can halter the game a bit.

Great and fun to play, but with some flaws:
-No fixed number of turns,when the players are trying to screw each other the game can last a long time.
-The trading with other players, while fundamental, can lead to kingmaking- "I don't want him to play so I'll give you all my resources so you can win first."
-It is possible to spend time getting annoyed by the everyone but you collecting resources, and the robber seemingly spending its entire time on your tiles.

Having said that, the game is still fun to play, but I prefer to play similar, more modern games that are annoying less of the time.

Pese a ser una de las primeras recomendaciones que se hace a alguien que quiera introducirse en esto de los juegos de mesa, he de decir que este Colonos de Catán no me gustó demasiado.

Me recordó bastante a un juego del mismo autor, pero bastante superior para mi gusto, Elausnd.

One of the best non-cooperative games out there in terms of player interaction. Each player almost always is doing something, even if it's not his turn. There are those who cite the rolling of the dice every turn as a sign that Settlers is light on strategy, but it is a rare game of Catan where luck outweighs strategy. Decisions on road, settlement and city placement are never easy.

RATING: 6
I've only played this a couple of times. I can see how it was revolutionary to a generation used to boardgames like Monopoly and Scrabble and Rummikub. And a game doesn't become less fun because newer and better games are out there. But the Catan fad just mostly passed me by.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wonderful game--perhaps should be a 10, but I can see that the base game might get old eventually (hence the existence of so many expansions, right?). I have played this more times than my log of plays suggests--probably more like 8 or 10. Initially I found the luck frustrating, but I have learned that much of my frustration came from an overly simplistic understanding of how to place settlements, which led to my not having settlements on a broad enough variety of numbers and resources. Initial placement is maybe a bit too important, but as I have gotten better at that aspect of the game I've enjoyed the game as a whole much more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I appreciate the design for spawning the new generation of eurogames. However, I'll never suggest it over anything else. The game is largely determined at setup, and if you find yourself in a bad position geographically, you're absolutely reliant on dice rolls and the strength of "negotiation", which is feebly implemented.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I feel that Catan is too luck based to be fun. If the dice like you, you'll be rolling in resources. If they don't, you'll be outraced by everyone due to no fault of your own, which can be pretty annoying.

A common gateway game that still holds up years later.  I enjoy the strong social/trading aspect, but there's fun to be had playing the dice, as well.

In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)—wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone—to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game that got me into modern board gaming. I've easily played Catan 200+ times--mostly over the span of 2 years when Settlers and Carcassonne were somehow enough to satiate my desire for tabletop gaming. These days, I just never really want to play it. Maybe to try out an expansion or two, but not much beyond that.

There are still things I appreciate about Settlers--the modular board setup, negotiation, intuitive set of resources to manage in order to race to 10 victory points, spatial elements that involve indirect conflict in settlement planning, and so on.

Certain things that have gotten old include unpleasantly high degree of luck in resource rolls; Constructing buildings doesn't really *do* anything other than help get you more resource cards (want more gameplay function!); And the game can really break down if people aren't willing to make good, interesting trades (see: luck). It's really a pretty simple game when it gets down to it. And there is a significant runaway leader problem, or at least a runaway loser problem. Resources, dice, Settlers.

Catan is really good at destroying friendships forever, the hallmark of a good game.

I can't say anything good about it that hasn't been said before, so I'll say something bad about it instead.

The one thing I don't like about Catan is that I find it a little too easy to get an early lead from mean positioning of my initial roads, etc., which basically subtly screws over other players for the entirety of the rest of the game.

This was not my gateway game, Carcassone was, which is why it rates much higher.  Settlers has multiple, major issues, mainly the dice I guess, but also that you can only play it with 3 or 4 people.  What a narrow window!  Especially when when we purchased it, we didn't have any boardgaming friends.  After multiple plays, it's made its way up to a 4.

When one plays more than 30 games of Puerto Rico before playing one game of Settlers, Settlers just doesn't stand a chance.

The Classic.  

A decent "gateway game," very aesthically pleasing.  I'd actually relegate it to a "second step" gateway game, as the rules are somewhat lengthy to explain to non-gamers, but it still works.

Yes, the dice are random.  Yes, you NEED to trade.  Yes, you can get screwed in spite of having a decent strategy.  Eh.  It's still a good game.

RATING: 4.5
Not very good. I think the positive reviews are largely a factor of it having been good in its time.

It's very easy to end up getting no resources or resources that others already have, so you end up unable to do anything and unable to trade for what you need. Possibly, if you bought the expansion for more players, but play with the original player count and an extra starting city, this would be mitigated.

But as it is, it's a trading game which has a pretty good chance of denying you from trading, and that's just not good gaming.

This is definitely a game that has fallen in rating as I have played more games. This game has forever pushed me away from any "player generated trading" mechanic in other games.

A true masterpiece of a game. Doesn't seem like it could be so fun, to grow crops on a hexagonal board. But there is something about the game that makes it fun. Guess it's the combination of hoping that the dice will score your crops together with the trading part of the game. Also fun to build, try to block other players and plan in the beginning where to put your starting markers. The robber is surely also part of the games success. The game is a nice mixed between skill, luck and social skills.

I really like Settlers of Catan and find it pretty simple to teach and play. The game board setup is a bit awkward at first but once the pieces are in place it's fine.

It can also be a bit too luck dependant and can get annoying when you've picked settlement start points on statistically more likely numbers, only to have them barely come up for the whole game! 

Still good fun though but can last a bit long sometimes which isn't fun, especially if you are losing.

Such a simple game but yet you have so many decisions.  I played this with my friend Lyman and immediately saw the potential for a great game.  I brought one copy to the gaming group and started the whole trend.  I ended up contacting a German MTG player who arranged to shipped about a dozen copies of the game plus the 5-6 expansion kit to our group.  This was before German game was avail in the US.
I have one very beat up copy and one unopened copy.  Both of them are Kosmo(red box) edition.

Not much to be said that anyone on this site doesn't already know.  Bonus points for being one of the games that showed non-gamers that board games aren't all Monopoly.

RATING: 6.5
One of the best games for introducing people to board games, since Settlers is simple, short, and has a fun trading dynamic. Unfortunately the strategic element is lacking and the game is completely dominated by dice rolls. It's appropriate for a relaxed, not intense gaming environment, but don't expect the game to confront you with many difficult choices.

The cooperative trading element of the game almost always breaks down near the end, because once someone is close to winning everyone else refuses to trade with that person.

I do find that the hexes have a tendency to move about which can be really irritating.
As far as playing is concerned, if you don't get the right positions early on, and/or the dice goes against you, it can be hard to catch up.

Seems to be ok, I'm just not interested in playing it.  The dice just seem to ruin the game for me - too much dependance on it, and I like chaos games!

Updated my score for this one.  The more I play this the more I see in it.  It needs more playing time.

So, it's a ten then. I hate to have to go with the crowd, but after several years playing, it's still one of the first games to come out during a session. Yes, there's a certain ammount of luck (I once won a game becuase the dice simply WOULD NOT stop coming up 4's. Guess who had 4) but it's usually up to the individual players as to what use they make out of their resources. An real winner.

For the level of simplicity of its mechanics, this game is pretty much perfect, apart from the theme being excessively dry and bland. However, it could be more ambitious and have more direct interaction in it somehow. I also feel the rounds pass too slowly because of the die roll and resource collecting at the start of each turn: this could perhaps be sped up somehow such as by each player taking their resource for the round simultaneously, for example, or something along those lines.

This was the first non mainstream (i.e. Monopoly, Clue, etc) game I played.  I think my first game was back in 2000 or 2001 and actually purchased it for myself in 2012.  I don't play it very often at all these days, but I enjoy it when I do.  I just have to be in the right mood.

RATING: 7
The fact that I still play this all these years later (and with my collection swollen to many times the size it was when I first got it) is a testament to how good Settlers is. Simple, clean rules, multiple routes to victory, and lots of player interaction. The endgame gets a little static, particularly with experienced players, but it's not a flaw too serious to keep me from coming back.

I don't particularly care for the 5/6 player expansion as it drags the game out too much.

Decided that we should start V off with Catan Junior and gradually move to the 'adult version'. Kids of Carcassonne was an excellent way to teach V tile laying and was/is easy for his non-gaming school friends to play. Catan Junior would probably work the same way.

Ah, "Settlers."  The granddaddy of all modern boardgaming.  Among the items on my bucket list is an afternoon spent drinking heavy German beers with Klaus Teuber while playing the original first printing of Settlers.

As for playing the base game only, I'm not as interested.  Add in 5-6 players with C&K and Seafarers, playing the Oceana scenario, and we're in business.  It turns the bland, but timeless experience into a dramatic opera of risk, intrigue (no relation to the crappy progress card...), and one-upmanship.  That said, I still prefer other games, and this one is really showing its age based on modern design.

Although this is one of the defining Euro games, the more I play it the less I like it.  The luck factor where you get turn after turn receiving no resources whatsoever is frustrating, to say the least.  Once you are on the backfoot, it is very difficult to come back.  The game is also too long for what it delivers.

The most overrated game on earth. When I first got into games I told people about it they asked if I meant games like monopoly. Now they ask if I mean games like Catan. When I first tried to get my group of friends into games I was trying to get them to sample several games. This was the second one they played. They grabbed onto it and would not let go. Most of them bought it. It was all they wanted to play for over a year. In that time my collection went from around 10 games to around 50. And all they wanted to play was Catan. It is a GOOD game. It is not gospel.

This is a really neat game.  There is player interaction, there are changing strategies to winning, and there is the psychological component of peaking too early and attracting too much attention to yourself.

Despite the flak it might get, I still enjoy this game maybe once a year.  Personally I feel the expansions to this game do it nothing but harm!  Settlers should be quick and simple, with player interaction and trading as its main driver.  People say the expansions fix things like the value of sheep.  I say who cares!  Why do all the resources need to be equal? Keep Catan simple, don't try to dress it up with awkward accessories.

Catan is a very solid game that combines strategy of completing a network with trading with other players. The game has a few downfalls in that it bases resources collection off a dice throw which can be frustrating if the odds of a number being rolled don't actually show up during your game. This along with the case of the strong getting stronger makes the game very hard to come back from behind if things go bad or unlucky early.

RATING: 6
Summary at bottom. Note that this review does not include the extensions for Catan!

Classic and a fair buy. Good for kids and casual players in terms of pace and content, as it's not too complicated yet you don't feel insulted by the weight of the game.

That being said, the game is relatively linear with little strategy required. One simply follows the sequence of collecting resources, trading with players and building settlement after settlement. It's not excruciatingly boring, but once you've played the game a couple times one may get stale of the predictable, slow-paced grind.

That being said, the game does include a sort of disruption mechanic to hinder other players, but it's completely based off of luck so not much thought required there either.

TLDR: Decent relaxing game. Great family game considering it runs along at a tolerable pace and is easy enough to grasp for the young and old. However, it requires little strategy and becomes rather stale after a couple of sessions.

It is extremely important to remember that this review is purely based off of the base game. There are several add-ons available that add a mountain of content and different play styles, that likely make the game a lot more compelling. However, I have played few sessions with them, so I suggest you take a look at the reviews for those as well.

Like many, Settlers is the game that got me in. But after years of playing better games Settlers has lost its shine.

It's a very good game for a bunch of inexperienced players since they will have lots of fun turning sheep into wood.

My copy must be nearly twenty-something years old and I remember playing it quite fondly back when I got it. What I most enjoy about this old edition is the lovely wooden blocks and hex illustrations that have sadly only gotten uglier wit the obtusely detailed plastic miniatures. So there's something to like about this game.

Unfortunately, every time I have got this game out of the closet I'm reminded that I very rarely enjoy playing it. The huge setup customization is nice, but the game is just excrusiatingly boring and luck-dependent. I recently taught it to my girlfriend and we seemed to be enjoying ourselves for a while, but quickly descended to one of us (admittedly, mostly me) being frustrated with the map layout and die luck. Whatever it is about the mechanics of this game, it seems more effective at inciting violent crimes than fun gameplay. This is sure to be merely my own local issue, but I've found it difficult to want to keep playing it more than a few games within a year or so. 
It has some positives, more than mentioned in the first paragraph, but it's just not my cup of tea.

It's hard for me to comprehend that this game is not rated higher. It's perhaps the reason for all of this that you see around you. For most Americans, this is the reason we don't associate board games with risk and monopoly. 

That said, Catan is the high school girlfriend that you remember fondly but have moved on from. You might still make out with her when you're home for the holidays, but otherwise you'd rather mack on the classier college girls with their lower back tattoos and PBR.

RATING: 6.6
Juego muy aclamado, pero que para mi gusto no tiene tanto que ofrecer. Es cierto, se tiene control en varias decisiones, donde colocar tus asentamientos y expandirte, pero hay partidas que definitivamente las probabilidades te juegan tan mala pasada que sientes que no tienes control de nada, el rezago del último jugador es bastante triste.

Eso si, no es aburrido, es un buen juego para 4 jugadores de duración media, aunque creo que si durara 1 hora cumpliría mejor su rol, con duraciones de 1 hora y 30 o 2 horas pierde gracia.

After numerous games I still enjoy the basic game. The random board makes every game a bit different. I really enjoy the trading and negotiating aspect in the game.
EDIT: For some reason I cannot get this to the table anymore at all. I don't feel burned on it at all, but maybe all others are?

I've only played the beginners games as instructed in the rule booklet. After a couple of plays it hasn't quite got me looking to flog it to death like most games I enjoy. My family enjoy it and like the trading with each other aspect but prefer Ticket to Ride. Problem is I'm itching to play a deeper game and I think that's the reason I've rated it so. I think after a few more games playing full rules this rating will improve.

My original gateway board game, really where I first got into the hobby. I still think it's one of the standard and best euros out there, and deserves its place in history for being a game which appeals to a multitude of people despite being a euro and a more heavier game than most amerithrash.

The part I dislike most about the game is the reliance of rolls to snowball into the later game. If you don't get great rolls early, it's very easy to quickly be pigeonholed into a boring, helpless position and vice versa. There is very rarely any playing from behind and the ending of the game is very anticlimactic. 

Overall, I still really enjoy the game and would be happy if pulled out just for familiarity but I would almost always want to pull out other games. Great gateway game.

Can't really add to the volumes that have been written about this game. It is very good if somewhat imbalanced due to the d6 system. Nice positional play with cities and roads, power plays with knights, and multiple scoring options. Biggest knock in a 4-player game is that someone is made redundant too early.

One of the very first games I ever played for real. Really something that brought the family together around the table.

I am still willing to play it but less so. By now, we just have too many other good games. I keep forgetting the bad parts about it. Settling at the wrong numbers, just get enough stuff to build your stuff but then be hit by the robber and so on. I gets better when you apply some houserules from 'the book' (I think this only exists in German).

I own many of the expansions, so the game is still varied. Some rules / scenarios I haven't even played once.

A very good trading game - and one that might attract females to games (I say this on the strength of it being one game that my daughter is happy to play, whereas my five sons have much wider tastes).

IMHO This game really deserves to be number one.  I have played and enjoyed hundreds of games of this.  We play with randomised island setup, the ability to respond directly to robber attacks, with only a single development allowed for each player turn (unless retaliating attack).  All rules which were available to be used if preferred in the original game.

I like that this game revitalized the board game industry. It's like the Monopoly of the current generation: an economic themed dice fest that takes forever and yet every body plays it. But I dislike playing it at times for the following reasons:
1. Dice luck is overwhelming.
2. Choices are obvious, you either have the resources to build what you want or you need to try acquire them some how. Acquiring is limited to lucky die rolls or trading.
3. If you are winning you might as well go take a nap because trade embargoes and robbers are coming your way.

Damit hatte meine Catan-Sammlung begonnen.
Von  Frank dann dieses sehr schöne Holzspielbrett für 6 Spieler zum Geburtstag bekommen.
Aber wenn man ehrlich ist, dann ist Catan mit 6 Spielern nicht wirklich lustig: es dauert viel zu lange bis man selber wieder an der Reihe ist (nur um dann evt. doch nichts machen zu können ...).
Mit 2 Spielern ist es eigentlich vollkommen uninteressant, da keiner der beiden wirklich zum Handeln bereit ist. Mit 3 bis 4 Spielern spielt es sich noch am Besten.
Eigentlich spielt es sich am PC oder Tablet noch am interessantesten weil am Schnellsten (und der PC verweigert das Handeln nicht aus Prinzip). 
Ich bin mir nicht sicher, wann bei mir Catan wieder auf den Spieltisch kommt.

Das [thing=2807]Ergänzungs-Set für 5 und 6 Spieler[/thing] ist eine einfache Karten- und Material-Ergänzung, um auch ohne Seefahrer oder Städte Überbau mit mehr als 4 Spielern das Basisspiel spielen zu können.
In der Realität ist Catan mit mehr als 4 Spielern nicht wirklich lustig gewesen. Aber da ich so ein schönes Holzbrett für die große Catan Version bis zu 6 Spielern geschenkt bekommen hatte musste diese Erweiterung einfach  sein.

Current edition has surprisingly flimsy components; I expected chunky tiles like Carcassonne, but the pieces are just thick paper.

It's popular for hard core gamers to dismiss this game in favor of more elite, less mainstream games, but Settlers of Catan stands in my opinion as one of the best games ever designed. It's important to note expansions should be added at your own risk. I feel they just muck up a perfectly elegant design with unneeded additives and try to turn the game into something it's not. The core, 4-player game is the only version I want to play. If I want to play something else, there are other great games.

As the descriptions are "9: Excellent - very much enjoy playing." and "10: Outstanding - will always enjoy playing."
This has to be a 9.5 - I only haven't enjoyed it much when halfway through my first play I realised that dominating sheep and having no source of brick was a fatal error, and another time when a friend trolled us by taking twice the amount of time to complete moves than he should have, when he already knew what he was going to do.
2-player variants aren't as enjoyable either, but none of the boxes suggest playing with 2 players, despite some expansions allowing you to play with 2 players.

It's fantastic as a gateway game in its huge improvements over classic games -- notably Monopoly.

But compared to all these other modern games now, I don't think it's as outstanding.  It's solid with some light decisions of what to build and an effective trading angle.  But it does have a bunch of die rolling that can influence the game to much.

I'd usually rather play something else.

I'm very lukewarm on this game - I think that Cities and Knights definitely added another dimension to the game.  Very good game to introduce new gamers to, has a huge random element to it, but that can be balanced through trading mechanisms.

Great classic game. Got tired (of the dice) after playing it for 1 year. Initial lucky rolls can give a lot of advantages (building more settlements and cities give you even more resources later)

Probably the first boardgame who showed me a greater universe of the board games and not the simple games based on basic system.
Beautiful the idea to use resources and the need to plan your strategy from the first moves and placement of the colonies.
However after a little it loses some of its flavour becoming to simple.
I reccomand it with the expansion City and Knights

My gateway.  I still enjoy it quite a bit, although it doesn't hit the table too much anymore.  The heavy emphasis on trading is highly interactive and really opens up the group socially, and this interaction is what elevates the game above it's simple and random mechanics

Wow. Game boxes used to be so ... drab!  It's brown with some brown on it. Yawn. The game is still the same though.

After not playing Settlers for ten years or so, and playing it 4 times in a month, I think I'm a bit Settler'd out. It's a good game, but it's definitely been surpassed (for me) in complexity and fun by later games.

UPDATE: I think I've identified what "gets me" about Settlers. If you are the player that falls behind -- and there's almost always a player that falls behind -- there is very little you can do to dig your way out of the hole you're in. In the rare game that doesn't have this happen -- like the game I played tonight, which ended with 9-8-7 points -- the game is a fun contest all the way through, but boy does it suck to be the pre-destined loser.

4/2012: Updated rating to be more realistic. Settlers is still quite a good game, even if it's not one I want to play a lot of.

I rarely see true mastery in game design, but, at least in my opinion, Settlers of Catan has it. The game is based enough on luck that a newbie can reasonably have a chance but based enough on skill that experienced players will have the edge. The social aspect of this game is brilliant. Half the fun is not spent actually playing the game, but rather playing with friends or complete strangers and making stupid jokes about "building a walmart" that "buys out the other settlements". If you can, purchase this game. You won't regret it.

Lots of conversation with this game, can be very fun, but it is also possible to get shut down early. Dice are so fickle, we can have a whole game where 11 or 3 or ? isn't rolled, or 5 is rolled only three times ... it can drive you insane.

I know I have not played this very much, but I don't think I ever want to play it again. I have found something worse than a runaway leader - a completely equal game, where no one really becomes 'the threat'; I was surprised how tedious that situation was.

It may have its place in history as the cause for the resurrection of board games, but man do I not enjoy it at all. It does one of the cardinal sins of gaming: dead turns.

Got me into board games again (I liked the game Risk when I was young). This game is a lot of fun, but eventually everyone figures it out. The negotiating/trading aspect of this game makes it better than other games which I consider dry, such as Puerto Rico. In fact, this game does the trading mechanism better than any game I know. The play interaction in this game is phenomenal. I recommend the Knights and Cities expansion.

Definitely a gateway game for many people.  With 4 experienced players, it can play out very quickly and when this is done, the game really shines.  If the game play starts to drag, the play experience will definitely go down.  It is still highly playable, but perhaps a bit too much luck based for more modern strategy fans.  Planning for the luck element will mitigate all but the most die-hard opponent of the game.  [GTI Code: TPCL]

Luck.  Stupid 9's (or whatever it happens to be any given day).  What sucks is that your destiny is tied so directly to dice.  Like monopoly or candyland.  Even risk does not seems so bad-luck cruel.  Still, Settlers is fun in spite of the dice.  In the end my biggest problem with settlers is not the dice directly, but the lack of viable long term strategy.  This is another per-turn optimization game.  For some unknown reason, as much as I hate its problems, I'll keep playing it.

I barely play this game anymore, and I wish I could rate it higher.  It's just a classic game in so many ways, from the randomized board to the resource trading, and it's so easy to play!  But the game bogs down during many trading sessions, and rolling dice every turn to determine who gets resource cards will ultimately leave some players sitting there WITH NOTHING TO DO for a few turns.  Settlers is a great introduction to German games, and when you've moved on to heavier stuff you can still reminisce about all the jokes involving sheep and wood.

Overrated.  Catan has a giant following, and I have no idea why.  Rolling dice to see who gets their resources each turn is a lousy game mechanic.  I've played this game against human opponents about 6 times, and that's enough for me.

A really nice game for both beginners and experts.
The rules are very clear and not complicated, I'd say it's a nice transition for monopoly and talisman players to get into a bit heavier games.

My wife and I had played Catan with her sister and husband.  We had a few drinks and we had a great time.  In fact, we had such a good time, I decided to buy the game even though we didn't really have enough players to play.  I saw that there was a Catan Junior and really had thought about getting it for our family.  After thinking about it a while, we opted against it and sat down with the family to play this one.  We found that the 10yr and 7yr was easily able to grasp the general concept of the game and my 5yr was on my team.  The boys quickly caught on and I swear my daughter was a shepherd in a past life time.  We always seem to stock pile sheep.

Oh, it's a classic, and I can easily be roped in to a game. But I wouldn't play more than once a month - in 17 years, we've come a long way. Strangely, Catan's open trading is still quite peculiar to the rest of gaming. In terms of components of my edition, the hexes and wooden bits are great and easily cannibalized, but the card art and cardboard chits are a little bland. I have no idea about newer editions.

I remember playing Settlers for the very first time, and seeing my mind expand as the possibilities and endless variations dawned on me. I'd never suspected such complexity could be created from such simple rules.
And yet I also remember how the best tactics to follow already became clear after a few games, and the game then started feeling a bit boring. When I finally started playing and buying boardgames regularly a couple of years later, I never bothered to add this to my collection. Yet when we encounter it somewhere else, it does often end up being a fun diversion.

Very good game for beginners. The game has simple and smart mechanics, good replayability and nice (yet not overwhelming) design. By playing this game with somebody who doesn't play board games You can show that They can do something more than throwing dice/pushing pawn and yet it's doesn't need to be hard/boring/pointless.
The game can be played with 2-4 players (where 3 players is optimal between spacial and crowded), takes about 60-90 minutes. The game is charming and fun but after couple of plays You might want to go for something more complex.

While I played Warhammer Fantasy years before ever touching a boardgame beyond Risk... this is the game that showed me there are fun pre-assembled games for adults. 

Always willing to play it and probably one of the best gateway games for people who like a little confrontation.

I love playing this on my phone ... which has made me wary about playing this in person. To play quickly, you have to realize when, no matter how trade you can do, you can't do anything and will have to pass. Also, initial placement is *critical*, as is early expansion (and block opponents growth). So it can be clear early on that you are boned, but you still have play the game out until an opponent gets 10 VP.

Para mí un pestiño de juego. Aun así lo valoro tan "alto" por ser lo más socorrido para sentar a primos, nietos  y abuelos en una misma mesa. (sigo sin explicarme porqué les gusta... pero les gusta).

RATING: 9
Great game to be played with friends & family (you can play it with a 12 yo kid, no problem).

It has an interesting replayability. The game mechanism is fairly simple:

You start with setting 2 cities on 2 ressources (on the board obviously), then it goes:
- Throw the die
- Collect ressources (everybody who has a building on the collectable ressources)
- Trade with the other players if needed
- Expand your roads, build a new city or buy a special card
- Repeat until you win 12 victory points (by creating cities and having specific cards)

The good point of this game is that even if it is not your turn, you can partially play by collecting ressources.

And this is the strength of Catan: No one gets bored!

A great game to introduce other people to a great hobby. It's got a very nice player interaction system, and the game's simplicity appeals just everyone (I haven't met the first person who doesn't like Settlers after playing it the first few times). However, with so many better options around now, both as gateway and gamer's games, this one gets less played every day.

UPDATE: I don't mind playing it, but don't enjoy it either. It's a far cry from most other euro games these days!

UPDATE: Just no. There are way too many better games these days to justify playing this long, boring game again.

RATING: 2
Since re-discovering boardgames about a year ago, after a gap of 25 or so years, I've encountered many superb games, some that are so-so, and a few stinkers. This is easily the worst. All it takes is a string of unlucky dice rolls at the start and you're knackered for the whole game. Other players will move ahead and their success breeds more success. I wouldn't say that the winner is determined in the first few rounds, but the loser usually is. It is much like Monopoly in that respect.
I simply do not think this works as a four player game, the board is too small and one player, the one who is unlucky with the early dice, will inevitably find that they're boxed in, unable to expand. The game is slightly better with three players but the in-built problem caused by being at the mercy of the dice remains. I've played Settlers of Catan a dozen or so times and in almost every game there has been one player who sits there turn after turn unable to do anything useful, forced to continue the game knowing they have no chance of winning. In that respect it is unlike Monopoly, which at least eliminates the players in the worst positions. 
It is wrong to consider this a gateway game. Yes, it is simple, but for at least one player sitting round the table it is likely to be the most tediously frustrating game imaginable. The experience, I would have thought, would be capable of putting newcomers to boardgames off for life. 
And don't even get me started on that chuffing robber.
Update. OK, I've given this a load more tries. My rating of 2 remains if this is played with 4 people, but I'd increase it to 5 if playing with 3.
Further update. Seafarers of Catan rescues this. Rating with this expansion: 6.5.

A great game with a nice different approach to a board and the manipulation of pieces.  It reminds me a lot of the computer game Mule without the auction stage, just the development stage.  4 player games are fun, but I think that the 5-6 player expansion may just make it a bit too large and cumbersome, but it is the only way to get bigger groups to play.

One of the Classic "gateway" games.  It's good fun and a great idea for three players or even four.  However I still prefer "Ticket To Ride: Marklin" when trying to engage people who are new to the hobby -- especially with 5 people.  I dont think Catan plays well with the 5-6 player expansion.

Had alot of fun playing this (mostly with 5 players or though I think 4 is best 6 is too many, hard on the last player). It can be very frustrating though but overal mostly fun. We hadn't played it for a while and had a game the other day and we all agreed that we'd forgotten how good it was. One member of our group has never won a game of settlers (30+ plays) that gives me alot of pleasure too.

2005-2006-ban a Carcassone mellett ez volt a másik játék, amit az "újabbak" közt volt szerencsém kipróbálni (új alatt azt értem, hogy nem activity és társai). Rám a kettő közül ez volt nagyobb hatással. Számomra addig ismeretlen elemek (pl. az alkudozás, a nyersanyagszerzési mód, stb.) nagyon színessé és vonzóvá tették a játékot, annak ellenére, hogy nem igazán voltam benne jó. Mára kicsit megkopott a varázsa, sok jobbat láttam már, de most is szívesen játszanék fele, főleg hogy van egy kiegem, amit még nem próbáltam!
---
Kipróbáltam a kieggel is. Nos nem rossz játék ez a Catan, de így hogy több mint 400 féle játékot ismerek, azt mondom, hogy vannak abból az időszakból olyanok, amik sokkal jobban kiállták az idő próbáját (El Grande, Tigris, Hannibál), bár a felsoroltak mindegyike eleve komolyabb játék, mint ez. Ma már csak nosztalgikus okokból ülök le a Catanhoz.
---
Újra előkerült, ebből is látszik, hogy még ennyi játék ismeretében sem zárkózom el tőle, de azért már nem az a megkerülhetetlen játék, ami 10 éve volt. Tegnap 2 partit játszottunk, és 10-8-4 ill. 10-4-4 lett az eredmény kb. azonos képességű játékosok közt (nem mindkétszer ugyanaz nyert, és nem is pont ugyanaz volt a játékosok összetétele). Ha az induló 2-2-2 pontokat nem számoljuk, akkor 8-6-2 illetve 8-2-2 a végeredmény. Az első parti másfél óra volt, a második 1 óra. Több játékossal simán lehet 2 óra feletti a játék, ehhez képest nevetségesen nagy a végeredményben mutatkozó különbség. A második partiban fél óra elteltével látszott, hogy ki lesz a győztes, és nem lehetett ellene mit tenni. Szerintem többek közt ezért áldozott le egy kicsit a Catan csillaga. De nosztalgiának továbbra is jöhet, csak fenntartásokkal fogom kezelni.

After all these years I still really like this game! The player interaction (trading, robber dynamics, etc.) is really the key to the fun here. There's no down time, because during any player's turn there can be haggling and extortion happening.

This is a 10 if played with dice decks instead. It has the bell curve for planning, trading/robber for interaction, and some blocking for cut throat play. Just a magnificent package, except for the dice! 

Update: 4-16-2007
This is the game that got me into this hobby.  I loved it and even played this 2 player and still loved it.  I thought it was the greatest game ever in the world.  I don't know if it is a good or bad thing, but the aforementioned sentiments has passed.  I find the gameplay/strategies in this game to be elementary and dull.  Really, the only exciting thing going on the game is seeing where the dice will fall.  Those two bones greatly affect how you are going to do in the game.  Of course there are somethings you can do to help you out, but the luck in this game is significant.  This game is hard to rate as I respect it and have nostalgic baggage that comes with it but I just don't want to play it more than I have to.

First one of the "Holy Trimurti" of the gateway games. Probably the best one, with the most strategic depth. It deserves a special place on my heart, because it somewhat was MY gateway boardgame: in 2001 I came from a period of Games Workshop only gaming, when I was lured in a game of Settlers while judging a Warhammer tournament in a gaming club.

The Grail of games. This game got me into modern day gaming. It's my 'go to' when spreading the word of how great gaming is.

Got everything, building, worker placement,take that, pit style trading, great components, strong theme, plays in an hourish, easy rules, etc

But you knew that anyway!!

Only down side to me is that it has never had a climactic ending

The game that changed everything for me. Everybody loves it and it is still a famous introduction to the world of games. We don't play it a lot anymore, but it is still in our mind. 

Through the years, the game has lost some of its appeal because of the big concurrence. That's why my score is reduced from 8 to 7.

RATING: 9
Real fun game when played with the right people AND when you're not crunched on time. Game can go fast, but I've also had games go well over two hours due to randomized tile placement. The length isn't a bother for me, but I can see how it'd be a turn off for some. In regards to gameplay, it's an excellent game that utilizes dice rolling probability, hand management, resource gathering, and network building all very well. Difficulty is low and will forever be an enjoyable classic strategy game for any experience level. Recommended Players: 4.

RATING: 9
Excellent.  Redefined how the world perceives board games.  Only flaw is that of many German board games: the stringent 3-4 player requirement. (The expansion takes care of that, I know, but still, it's annoying to not have it all in one.) Brilliance in a box.

An increadibly balanced game that suffers slightly from its random nature. At the same time, the random aspects keep the game interesting, ensuring that no two games are ever exactly the same and allowing new players a chance to compete with the more experienced. Settlers is a fantastic "2nd step" for new players that have tired of A Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne and are ready to try something new.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An awesome game, and one I can definitely understand why it's called a modern classic!  Catan is a simple game to pick up, but has a great layer of strategy in terms of where to build to help you acquire resources, where to move the robber, and when to buy and play development cards.  You really can't stay out of each other's way in this game; if you want to win, you have to do some blocking and backstabbing, which makes the game a lot of fun.

My two slight knocks against the game are that the game is only for 3-4 players and requires hacks or expansions to do 2 or more than 4 players, and a blunder early on is typically so significant that, unless your opponents make a similar one, you will never recover and are just on a slow march to an inevitable loss.

It may be a cliché, but Settlers was my gateway too. This game has opened so many eyes to gaming, and it has both unexpectedly and spontaneously done so much for the industry we hold so dear.

Catan was my first entry into euro-gaming.  After I introduced it to my family, we would play a game or two every Sunday evening.  After a couple of years, tensions started building and some people would feel victimized by the Thief so it got shelved and has only been taken out a few times since.  The expansions really added a lot to this one.

RATING: 9
Quite simply, the best game I have ever played.

This was my first Eurogame and I am truthfully not sure if I would have become as hooked as I am now playing any other game.  I believe that this remains the best game to introduce nongamers to when trying to convert them to Eurogames.  Further, if the nongamer has a dice game background, such as Monopoly, it makes my argument stronger as they will be comfortable with the dice roll.  The rules are quite simple and after a ten minute quick explanation and quick couple of rounds, most newbies will have things down pat.

Settlers has some randomness to the game as resource production is determined through the roll of dice, but more often then not I find that the person who manages their resources best wins the game.  Trading plays a very important roll in this as people who are able to complete more trades improve their position more often then not.  This game is a lot of fun and very addicting!  A must have for every gamer and a great way to send you down the path of gaming for nongamers.

This still easily one of the cheapest games I got when considering cost per play.  However, even though I have played this hundreds of times, it has been over one or two years (currently 2010) since I have played it and I have no desire to pull it out again.

This was my gateway game though and I will forever be grateful to it for converting me to such a great hobby.

This is the game that got helped me rediscover my love for boardgames.  Up until I played Catan (circa 2005) the games I mainly played were Risk!, Samurai Swords (Ikusa), and Strat-o-matic Bball.  Catan served its purpose well of a gateway game.  I played this game (usually 1-3 in one sitting) and its variants once a week with a gaming group (usually 4-6 players) for about 2 years.  Catan led me to playing other games from other publishers and is no longer played much at all.  Nonetheless, Catan is in my hall of fame.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
An elegant, perfect blend of player interaction, secret information, catchup mechanics, meta game, trading, area control, replayability, and luck.  People say that Catan introduced concepts that other games have since perfected, but I can think of no others that balance all these facets so seamlessly. A classic for a reason.

Downgraded AGAIN the game recently. The last 6 games I played were boooooring. The first placement of settlements is SO important for the rest of the game that one error in the setup makes for a rather dull 2 hours of family gaming.

OK, perhaps it's my bad luck in throwing the dice recently, but a bad start should never ruin a game for the next 2 hours.

[i]The Settlers of Catan[/i] focuses on colony building and trading. There is no combat element to be found anywhere in this game, although a player can be a bit ruthless with the placement of the "bandit" piece. This lack of simulated armed conflict makes [i]Settlers[/i] an easy game to recommend for children.
 
The game board can be randomly created, which definitely adds to the game's replayability. Interaction between players is essential to winning this game -- another plus. Lastly, the resources are represented by cards, so there aren't any complex money transactions that would require a calculator to compute. 

[i]The Settlers of Catan[/i] offers innovative gameplay, is easy to understand, does not attempt to model violent conflicts, and above all is fun to play. I am looking forward to introducing many of my friends to this great game.

[i]The Settlers of Catan[/i] was one of the first "Eurogames" that I played.  Since that time, I've developed a bit more perspective.  I still really like it, but it has lost some of its luster.  On your turn, a bad roll can benefit your opponents more than yourself.  Enough of those rolls, and the other players can prevent you from developing (with 3 or four players).  Trading in desperation just makes matters worse.  If this scenario happens to you, you're effectively removed from contention, sometimes very early in the game.

[i]Updated: 1/2/10, Rated: 9[/i]

Here we are in 2010, and I now own the 4th edition of [i]Settlers of Catan[/i].  I traded away my copy of the 3rd edition so that my set could be compatible with the version of [i][gameid=325][/i] which is currently available.  And I forgot how good this game really is.

Yes, I still get upset about poor rolls.  However, that frustration is due in part to poor planning: if I can branch out quickly enough, then I can settle on enough numbers to generate resources.  The social aspect of the game is also blossoming as my sons get older and more astute.  The game deserves a "9."

In fact, it might be a 10 if it weren't for the components.  The tiles in the 4th Ed. are thicker, but they need to be twice as thick as they are now to have an appropriate amount of "heft."  The frame is a great idea, but the "puzzle tabs" don't fit perfectly well together, and they feel as though they would fray over time.

I think a perfect version of the game would require two copies.  On every hex tile in one copy, cut/punch/route a hole for the roll marker.  Also take out little edges for half of a road.  Now, glue the tile onto it's matching (unmodified) mate from the second set.  You will now have tiles twice as thick, with the ability to "inset" the rolling markers and the roads.  Coming up with a shape that could accommodate both a settlement and a city at the corners would be difficult: the best shape I can think of would be a rectangle, but distributing its shape amongst the three corners of adjacent hex pieces would be difficult.

The cards are thinner stock than those found in the 3rd Ed.; this is the one place where the game falls short.  The cards aren't a size for which I have found a readily-available sleeve, either.  The four player colors are red, white. blue, and [i]orange[/i], which is surprising when green or yellow should have been readily available.  The robber is now grey instead of black.  The cards and colors were better in the 3rd Ed.

The 4th Ed. is still a better version overall, and the gameplay still shines.  Still, if a game is going to get the magical "10" then it needs to be perfect in every way.  [i]The Settlers of Catan[/i] just barely misses the mark.

[i]Updated: 6/23/17, Rated: 6[/i]

Wow, where has the time gone?  Almost seven and a half years since I last updated this rating.  And the real reason for the three-point drop is that the base game by itself is...well, I guess the best way to say it is that it's showing its age.

I still enjoy the engine-building aspect of the game.  I can even accept capricious resource gathering via dice rolling.  Being able to negotiate with the currently-active player every turn reduces down time.  The combination of those factors can create a game with doldrums if the other players unite against you.

[i]Catan[/i] with expansion(s) is a better experience, but the base game on its own has dropped down in comparison to more modern offerings.

My very first "eurogame". It's very easy but gives a lot of fun. Rules may be explained in less than 10 minutes, so it's game for everyone to play on everytime. After couple of plays it gets little borring, but has lot of expansions which save situation.

Somtimes it's too random (dice throwing).

there is no better way to make grown adult humans turn into petty a$$holes.
catan is a fun entry into boardgames for many, but since the majority of the strategy happens in the first turn (board set up/tile selection), the rest of the game is spent begging other people to trade resources with you. It's a game of nearly purely negotiation.

I *still* play this game from time to time so it's hard to rate honestly. I don't much care for it anymore. A lot of my family does, however, so it continues to get played. And I don't have an awful time when I am involved.

RATING: 7
A relatively easy to learn game that is enjoyable to play and gives everyone a chance to do well. My biggest gripe with this game is that I've found myself really "well-diversified" on numbers which, seems like a really good thing until I lose all the cards in my hand just before my turn. If it happened only on occasion or if I was hoarding resources it'd be easier to tolerate but sometimes it seems like it can happen every-other-turn or more and I try to use most/all of my resources on each turn. 

Besides my nit-picking there, this game really does well at rewarding good strategy and is enjoyable with a group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ya know, I DON'T like the randomness of the dice. I DO like the negotiation part - I really get into the meaty roles of tradesmanship and deals, etc. Just the conversational part. (So, uhm, that mean Genoa is my cup of tea? Or Princes of the Rennaissance?) Haven't really dug into the Cities/Knights part yet, so some serious exploration to go. I do find the game a tad too long (by 30-60), for the level of return.

All Luck.  Players can quickly find themselves playing for last place.  This game gives no chance for mounting come from behind victories as the rich get richer and poor get poorer.  I love the board variety and the idea of negotiating trades but your ability to produce resources on dice rolls is suspect.  Game setup plays too heavily into the final outcome.

Settlers is great for its accessibility to new players and the way the game encourages player interaction. The variable board setup adds replayability and long-term interest, while the (mostly) static number arrangement ensures the probabilities are always balanced, even when some resources are scarce. The element of luck can be overly strong at some times, particularly if one player gets a string of bad rolls at the beginning of the game. In other games (Tigris & Euphrates, Puerto Rico, etc.), the player can always take some productive action even when luck is not on his side; in Settlers, the player simply cannot act. I would like to see an official way to mitigate bad luck, but some version of the '[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/150443/the-famous-welfare-variant]welfare variant[/url]' should work well enough. While I appreciate that trading keeps players engaged, I do not enjoy the mechanic as much as other modes of player interaction, as I feel like I have to 'act' in order to play well. For this reason, the game isn't at the top of my list, but I do enjoy playing it with the right group. [8] (2012-03-23)

After many more plays of Settlers, my appreciation for the game -- and rating -- has improved greatly. Strings of good/bad luck can still hurt, but with good placement (diverse numbers) and repeated play, I don't see it as a major flaw in the game; rather, it is most often the result of a flaw in a player's initial placements. Sometimes it's not, but that's to be expected in a game with dice, and it's not likely to happen again in the next game (or if it does, it's an indication that the fault may in fact be with the player). I will now gladly recommend Settlers and will play it any time I am offered the chance to do so, especially with 4 players (3 is also ok; 5 and 6 work but 4 is preferable). I appreciate the fact that though the game is fairly simple (very few rules) and repetitive (each turn offers the same single mandatory action and few voluntary actions, compared to worker placement or role selection games), the game is still tense and exciting due to the competition for key settlement spots, the need to make a critical trade, and the fear of letting one player get too much of a lead before others are positioned to catch up. A great design worthy of all the praise it has received. [8 -> 10] (2014-01-22)

Quick to learn and launch into. I have played this c6 times and now believe the moves and strategies to be substantially driven by the dice and much more than I originally thought. Admittedly things do tend to generally balance and strange dice result frequencies do occur, but I see it as a significant weakness in the game that players can sit around for 10 minutes (worst case 1 hour!) unable to make progress owing to none of their territories producing through weird dice rolls. Its a case of frantic activity or complete shut down. If this happens at the early development stage it is near impossible for a player to pull it back. I realised very slowly that I really dislike this aspect of any game and would need substantial persuasion to play this again so mark down to 4.

Years pass and I really dislike the dice mechanic for this game. Reduce rating to 3.

Still one of the best gateway games but it shows its age. It was what got me (and many many others) into gaming so I respect it for that. It has two significant flaws however: 1)you can practically lose the game before it even starts by choosing bad starting spots. This shouldn't be a problem for experienced players but it's a flaw that a "gateway" game shouldn't have. And 2) you live and die from the dice rolls especially in the beginning stages of the game. Getting an early advantage by building more cities/settlements (which then generate more resources) before others can is pretty huge.

It gets a 6 from me because in it's heyday, sometime in the mid 90's, it would have been a 9, and now I will never play it again if I can help it, so I will settle in for a 6.  Not offensive, but not gushing, either.  Classic gameplay, with classic rules that opened a whole new world to me, and spawned the creation of Robespierre the Thief.  Also "Help Me" spelled out by Ziskin.

One of the all-time best. Surprises me that games like Puerto Rico rate higher. Plenty of interaction and plenty of reasons to pay attention to what your opponents are doing.

Still, I never hesitate to accept a game invite.

Catan used to be one of my favorite games, but it has since lost some of its luster with me and my group. Too much randomness in what is a fairly deep strategy game (randomness is good in a light "filler" type of game), trading seems lackluster with some groups (no fault of the game, but my group) and there's too much importance with initial placement of your villages when you don't even know what tiles are coming out. Ready to trade this with my expansions. I own the red box Mayfair edition (the one with the "pilgrim" looking folks on the cover).

What a wonderfully easy game to get into. There are a small number of decisions to make, but they are tough to make.

HOWEVER, I am always willing to play a game.

I've probably played over a hundred games of Catan. The only reason I don't give this a 10 is the excessive impact of the placement of the two starting settlements.

I've played this on various computer games, and it's always bored the living whiz out of me.  ALWAYS.

But, hundreds of thousands of copies sold can't be wrong, right?

EDIT:  Played this and had a great time.  It did run a little long even for as reasonably streamlined as our turns were, but that was nothing that couldn't be solved by say, playing to 8 rather than 10.

What I really liked about it, is if I had to come up with one game that encompassed all that it meant to be a game, with negotiation, strategy, and luck in all equal parts...  this would be that game.

08-15-11:  This game always takes just a hair longer than it aught to.  It's probably me that causes it, too.  In the end though, I'd rather play almost anything else.

Oh, and grind the development stack.  You can't go wrong.

SOLD.

09-18-11:  I think one of the things about this game going too long, is that it's a bit of a fractal representation of everyone on the board.  That is, the story doesn't really ever arc even as a winner is emerging.  People still trade, because it's helping their individual positions anyway.  The guy on the board who is getting the most shit, will find a way to get even more shit just as well getting his 10th point as he is getting his 7th point.

Brilliant--extremely fun and a model for combining social interaction and strategy in a game.  The rulebook is obtuse, this is best learned by playing.

Those with some appreciation for economics will also love how features of real markets--profit, fluctuating prices, and comparative advantage--emerge without being dictated in the rules.

Get the 5-6 player expansion and use it even for 4-player games; the more open island keeps players who get off to a slow start from becoming frustrated in their attempts to build.

Brilliant.  A model for including social interaction in a strategy game.  Extremely fun even for first-time players.  The rulebook is a bit obtuse--teach new players by including them in the game.

Play with the 5-6 player expansion, when playing with 4 or more players, and use the rule that allows players to build (in sequence) on every turn.  This prevents players off to a slow start--or the last in line--from being frustrated, and makes for a more balanced game.

Those with some appreciation of modern economics will be delighted by the emergence during the game of features of real-world markets, such as fluctuating prices, comparative advantage, and profit.  This changes by end-game when players start to worry about someone winning and start working to thwart one another.  Perhaps there's a lesson in that.

Boring, slow and long. 
There are not enough meaningful decisions. 
The first to start making a road has a very big advantage, being able to cut the other player's path. 
Too much luck, and in a bad way. I like when each player gets what deserves due to the way he plays. Here a player can screw himself but still get lots of whatever product he needs

UPDATE: Ok, I was too critical. The game IS a bit too luck-intensive for my liking, and first turn placement p`lays too big of a role, but it's still a good game.

Well, I haven't figured out the strategy of this game yet because I just got it and introduced it to our group, but we played it four times in the first sitting, so it must be good!

The production values are average and the gameplay isn't terribly diverse, but the randomly assigned board makes each game exciting and different. Players need to plan for VP growth as well as expansion in order to get to the better resources before their rivals or so as not to get webbed into a corner. Haggling with friends (or frenemies) in order to get resources to flip a wasted turn into something productive is always fun.

I have to thank Mr. Teuber, whose Starfarers of Catan introduced me to the hobby.  Settlers is a better introductory game, better balanced, and deserves its place in "history".

RATING: 7.8
This will always hold a special place. It's a timeless classic that has its share of flaws, but it really has helped bring a lot of people into modern board gaming. It's fun to play once in a blue moon, especially as a gateway for non-gamers and new gamers. It's tense with hoping for certain resource numbers to appear, racing to take space before your opponents, and pushing your luck with hand size limits and the robber. It's interactive through negotiating trade with your opponents and through the building race.

To help mitigate the overly swingy luck factor that I find to be the biggest flaw, I like to use a stack of cards with perfect probability distribution instead of dice, and also a board setup calculated for fairness by the Better Settlers website. (Side note:  I had a friend who was opposed to this deliberate balancing saying it was out of the spirit of the game, but then the game we played ended up with final scores of 9-9-9-10. I have never seen a 4 player game so close! Everyone was one turn away from victory.) The kingmaking aspect can get a little mean, so hopefully players don't take it personally.

I'm gratified that this game has finally broken into the mainstream...15 years after it was developed.  This gives me hope that better games like Puerto Rico will eventually be in every household.

I admire Settlers for what it did for the board-gaming hobby, but it's not a great game.  The majority of time, you're going through scripted motions and waiting for the dice to fall.  There's little tactical variability, little need to be adaptive -- the whole game plays out on the basis of just a handful of key decisions.

Ah Catan, the gateway game.  Solid game for family gaming and initial entry into board games.  Start with two towns and roads with limited resources, expand your roads, build more towns and upgrade to cities to accrue more resources on each random resource roll.  Interact with other players to trade resources.  For me, this game was best with the knights and cities upgrade.

The game that redefined boardgames for me. Settlers had non-hardcore-gamer appeal and a game was played in an hour.  That meant you could cram in 5-6 games in a day. This one has seen a crazy amount of play back in the 90s, so it is rarely taken out anymore.

This is one of the first board games of the new generation that I played, cuz that's what everyone said to do.  It's an okay game, but since, I've played many a better game.

UPDATE:  Lowered from an 8 because, since moving on to more euro games, I've NEVER come back to this...not once.  And, since becoming more aware of the current board-game scene, I can't believe so many people consider a game so heavily based on player-to-player free-form trading to be such a good gateway game.  I often times have a tough time getting my "non-gamers" to follow the very specific basic rules of a game, let alone making up free-form trade offers based on resource needs that they don't understand yet.

A couple more playings of just the base game have dampened how I feel about it even more.

My personal gateway game still holds up well.

Rated as though it were a 4p only game.  I rate this a 4.5 with 3p; having the extra building space available removes most of the difficult decisions from the game.

Elegant and attractive resource management and trading game.  Simple enough to draw new players, yet with enough opportunities for cagey strategizing that more experienced players will have plenty to think about.

There’s little new to say about the Settlers of Catan, one of the most successful and played games of all times, the one that shares with Carcassonne the honour of having changed - for the worse - the way games are made and played today: as the father of all eurogames, Settlers is the «game for everyone» par excellence, as it’s easy enough to grasp, fairly quick to play, moderately fun and it even requires a pinch of strategy; sadly though it’s boring, themeless and devoid of any real interaction among players as well, let alone ramdomness. [i](November 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Although it makes for a decent gateway game (but there are many more better at that), I still can’t stand Catan and shun it whenever I can: this is why during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered its rating to 4, which better reflects my feeling towards it.

The game that started it all for me, and still one of my favorites.  I love the player interaction, i love the mechanics.  If you are not a fan of games that have luck in them, then yes go look somewhere else, but this game is just simply a lot of fun!

Not a huge fan of the expansions that add more players, or that make the game more complicated, but the Traders and Barbarians expansion adds little variants that keep the game fresh.

It all began in 2002 with Settlers of Catan...for me that is.  I owe a great deal of gratitude to Settlers of Catan for my passion of board games...and the countless hours of family fun, friendships, and hobby fever that ensued. A few thousand dollars, and a not too small and growing collection later, I say: thank you Settlers of Catan!  A true Euro classic that everyone should play a few dozen times.

This is a game that has a little more depth than the old 'classic' board games, but is still a good casual party game.  I'd consider Catan an excellent way to get 'classic' board game (monopoly, etc) lovers into more modern gaming, but if you like more complex games you'll probably move beyond it before long.

RATING: 9
UPDATE: 01/10 - Well, I've been the hobby for quite a long while, and even though I don't play Settlers with my gaming partners much any more, I still use it as my main game to bring people into the hobby, and I still always have fun when I play it.  One caveat - I only like playing it as a 4-player game.  With 3, I think the board is too 'open' (Play RA instead!)

A classic.  Settlers introduced me to the world of 'real' games.  I've played it a ton a times, and still never say no to a round.

Best game ever designed, but I&#039;ve played it too much and now I&#039;m burnt out on the basic game.  Bring out any of the expansions, however, and I&#039;ll play anywhere, anytime!!  This is one of the few dice games that I really enjoy.  It&#039;s very exciting when you have a hand full of cards and you are praying that no one rolls a 7, or you have 2 cities on a 9 wheat field and a 9 is rolled!!!  Brilliant game by a brilliant game designer.

This wasn't my first game, nor my first euro.  So, it really didn't seem all that groundbreaking to me at all.

Update 12/2010:  I liked it better the second time even though I had an awful game.  The key is to play with people who will trade.  I had fun this second time and would play again sooner, than later.

Update: March 2012 - up to a 7 on my third play.  I do enjoy this one...I like the trading.

I think I've played Settlers out; I'll still say yes to a game because at this stage in my life I'm grateful to be playing anything, but I don't really have a desire to play this anymore.

After Carcassonne, Settlers is probably the most played game in my library. This and Stratego Legends were my gateway games. There was a time when I would have rated Settlers an 11, but now I only feel that way about the game when playing with the Cities and Knights expansion. Regardless, I believe that a house may be a house, but it's not a home until it has Settlers.

Great intro into German Games, but too much luck keeps it from joining the upper echelons of gaming goodness.  Now luck is not a bad attribute, but in Settlers it always seems like one player gets screwed enough to have no opportunity to win.  I don't like luck when it ordains the amount I can enjoy a game.

Reminiscent of Monopoly. Might have been very good at the time, but how this continues to be so popular amidst much better alternatives absolutely baffles me. Maybe it is because of the annoying attempts of Kosmos to milk this dry till the last drop?! Every option, be it trade or building, is dependant on how the dice just fell. There is probability, of course, but ultimately this just evokes a facade of strategy that in reality is nowhere to be found.

This is a game I used to *really like. It was my first intro to German-style gaming. It had innovative ideas, good production value and easy to learn/play rules. HOWEVER, after about 10+ games I started to resent the fact that Lady Luck decided the course of my production more than I did. Nor could I stand the tedious wait for game-end, if after set-up, I was barrred from growth by others' placements.

My family were not big boardgamers before, but now at least a few games of Settlers are a guaranteed part of any family get together.  We've developed "house" rules and learned to include/exclude expansions to regulate the length of the game.  A fantastic game deserving of its fine reputation.

The base game gets old after too many plays. It's a game that my friends pull out more often than not, and I'll play, but I often find myself getting bored. Part of the problem is that if you don't get the right mix of resources, you really have no chance to win (maybe I just need to work on my strategy). Sometimes, turns can take forever, making the wait to play between turns too long. This is because there are multiple actions a player can take on their turn, instead of just one.

With four players, this is about as perfect a game as I could hope for. I've lured more people into gaming with this game than anything else. My only complaint is if the ore and brick end up having rare numbers on them, you're going to be in for an excruciating game. Also, I've seen people through no fault of their own get boxed into an area and thus it becomes an impossibility for them to win (because there aren't enough victory points in the deck, and that ends up being their only option). That sort of thing doesn't bother me so much in conflict-oriented games, but in a game like Settlers, it can be a drag. Still, this game is usually a tremendously entertaining time.

If you play it at a good clip, this is one of the all-time greats.  Take too long, though, and odd dice rolls or early mistakes will make the game frustrating.

Played to death in 96-97. Not a favourite now. Bought a copy recently as my kids enjoyed for a while. Once they were bored I sold it. Not worth the shelf-space for me.
Avoid 5-6 player expansion at all costs.

RATING: 5
A classic, and still a pretty good game. The dice can be cruel, though, and even though you know the odds for the numbers, a dry spell for you in the beginning might have other players blocking your roads and taking the remaining good spaces of the map...

This is not a very good game, and most of its spinoffs are terrible.

Chance is a huge factor in Settlers, and as long as you understand basic probability, skill is not.  I guess the two things it has going for it are that its board is randomized and that it doesn't take very long to play.

Loved it when I was a "newer player" but it lost my interest rather quickly over the years at it now feels like a glorified form of yahtzee.

Can I possibly say anything that hasn't been said? This game singlehandedly converted an entire side of our family into occasional boardgamers. My mother recently requested a second copy of the game so that they can keep one at camp and one at home.

For all family Thanksgiving and Christmas Day afternoons from now to forever, I am grateful. Even if Mom does wipe the floor with us.

I started playing this because everyone was playing this. I soon learned that it's easy to end up with no early resources or in a poor position or on the receiving end of bad dice rolls and antagonistic trading... and spending 90 minutes watching other people win while unable to do anything is not my idea of fun.

Great introduction to Euro-games for newbies. Will be constantly requested for weeks on end until they begin to realise how bad the luck factor can be.

RATING: 6
This is a classic, of course, and deserves praise for its innovations. My experience with this game is that it's very tense but not always for the right reasons. Randomness plays a big part in the resources available and the roll of the dice; the heavy negotiation of the game is driven by imbalances caused by the dice. The problem with the negotiation element - really the heart of the game when the endgame comes into view - is that games seem to be won when a player is led into misperceving that trades will allow another player to win. A mistake is made and the game is less won by the player than given to the player. The theme here is very, very weak and the whole exercise seems pretty dry which could have made up for some of my issues with gameplay.Generally, it's good but I'd prefer to play something else now that there are better options available.

This is one of the absolute classics that brought board gaming to a broader audience. So it has its place in board game history next to being an enormous commercial success. I rate it so low because I never really enjoyed playing it. My introduction to board games came from the likes of Kiesling, Kramer and Knizia and the luck ridden mechanics of Catan never appealed to me.

I don't like the fact that in a 4 player game, halfway through it's obvious which two players are going to win and which two players are out. There's negotiation to mitigate bad luck and lagging behind, but it strongly depends on the player group how this pans out.  

Ah well. Personal taste and all.

Es un clásico. Estrategia y gestión de recursos con un poco de azar. Observo cierta ansiedad en algunos jugadores según avanza el juego y a mi eso me encanta.

This game grabbed me in the '90's. And the series is among my favorites. This games makes you manage the luck factor by playing strategically (by deciding where to build, where to expand, which resources to trade). The trading aspect of resouces makes it a very social game as well.

To preserve it well, I also have a luxury wooden case which also contains Seafares en Cities & Knights of Catan.

RATING: 9
50 plays:

Such elegant design! So few choices, but ones that matter! Such good use of randomness! Such simple compensation for being behind! Such pressure and reason to negotiate! So many ways to win! Just a perfect game, satisfying nearly every time I've ever played. It's true that if you aren't good at it, you won't win... that's not the same as "the player behind can't catch up".

And nearly immune to analysis paralysis, because so few options are open each turn. It can get a bit stuck in complex negotiation proposals.

Trying to play this with eight-year-olds showed me Catan's flaws, however. When the dice do nothing for you for several rounds, the game can get frustrating and boring. My daughter actually burst into tears at one point because she was getting so many sheep, and nothing but sheep!

One of my gateway games that got me started on this whole board game nonsense. ;) Loved it at first, now the base game on its own is a little too vanilla. 

Cities & Knights is essential and the Seafarers expansion is terrific, as well.

Edit: As time goes by and I play more games, my revisits to Catan become less and less interesting. Lowered to a 5.

I know it's the quintessential "gateway game," but that doesn't mean it's very good.  This game excels at its gateway role because it adds important decisions, while still relying on the luck of the dice to which traditional board game players are accustomed.  At it's heart, it still relies more on that luck than on decisions.

There was a time when I loved this game.  But I know now that I was merely naive.  I've moved on, never to return again.

如果要擴廣紙板型桌遊給新手，我認為這是一個不錯的選擇。但對於老手來說骰子運氣因素過強，而且也有其他更好的選擇。

給新手：
1.最初的二間房子的佈置占了勝負的一半，另一半則是骰運，嘴炮能發揮的作用出奇的低。
2.怖局策略分類:
 木磚建築型：擴張速度高及可封殺其他玩家的出路，標準穩定的打法。
 麥石升級型：初期注重升級，後期注重抽牌的戰術，但房子提供的分數會不足，是否擁有第四個房子就成為勝負關鍵，個人最喜歡的戰術。
 平均發展型：最注重玩家交際手段的怖局法，上位時很容易被封殺，個人不推薦。
 交易自閉型：若地圖的狀況很差，在放第一個房子時達不到上述策略，就可以先選專攻其中一種作物，然後第二個房子直接放在相對應的海港上，作物優先度麥＞木＞羊，這種打法只要等其他玩家來求你換你手上的東西就好。

RATING: 5
Ubiquitous multi-player game that is social enough and non-warlike enough that you might be able to convince your wife or girl-friend to play with you. The game is driven by rolling two D6 at the start of each player's turn that will determine which players will collect the various resources that are needed to build the structures in the game that you use to expand and produce victory points.

The game is therefore highly unpredictable, and can be frustrating when the dice behave as dice will. I would be less down on the randomness quotient if it played more quickly; but if you are unlucky early, you are in for a long night with little chance of recovery!

I have about exhausted the novelty this game once presented to me. The one line description I recently read, "lightly themed Yahtzee," pretty much sums it up for me...

The game that started it all for me.  Found this on Xbox Live and ended up playing it all the time.  My other 60 dollar games collected dust. That game led me to this site, which led to my new boardgame obsession, which led to the Dark Side..and so on and so on.  I hesitate to give a game a 10 but according to the info on ratings: "Outstanding.  Always want to play and expect that will never change."  This is true for me with this game.  Unfortunately most of my gaming is 2 player, and the 2 player variants aren't nearly as enjoyable to me.  Fortunately the Xbox AI on hard is a good challenge, plus there's always live opponents..so when I need my fix I can get it.

Edited three years later from original comments above:  The game is no longer a 10 for me.  When I first got it it was really my only exposure to this type of board game.  Now that I've acquired and played many more games poor old Catan has kind of been left behind.  Still, for sheer nostalgia alone I still give this game an 8.

It's funny, I've played well over 150 euro and strategy games before I ever played Settlers and I wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. I'm generally not a big fan of dice (read:luck) however, this game is short and sweet so that's not a big issue for me. It's very exciting to me that there are so many expansions and ways to keep enjoying it. I dont currently see it wearing out its welcome.

Works okay when played as a family game (offer the loosing guys nice trades to keep them in the game). Bad luck in the beginning can kill your game. Nearly half of the games I played ended up with one or two guys unable to recover from a bad start. Luck dominates over strategy, and there is no direct way to attack the leader.
Of course many people really like this game...

I'll never get rid of this because of it's gateway factor, but because of how easily you can get resource-screwed based on die rolls, I recently introduced components into the game to play the "Pauper" variant, and won't play without it now.  

Unfortunately, I'll never suggest a game of this with other experienced gamers.  For new gamers however, I'll always bring this out to introduce them to the world outside of Monopoly.

A must own for every board gamer.  The design, lay out, simple wooden playing pieces and card quality are excellent.  We fell in love with this game right away.  everyone is involved in trading, development and harvesting on every roll of the dice.  Captivating design and a boat load of fun.

Fun game that got me into modern board gaming.  I'll never refuse a game.  My biggest gripe is that 50% of the game is initial placement.  Judging from that alone, you can usually see the winner coming a mile away, and the game itself is just going through the motions.

Unless, of course, the die rolls are erratic (why haven't we rolled any eights?!)

RATING: 6
A fun game that our gorup likes to fall back on.  Sort of like our "old Reliable".  I really enjoy the trading and bargaining involved.  Yes the game has some luck elements but they are manageable.  It's a good game for introducing new players to the hobby.

Rating lowered to a 6.  All of the above still apply but I would add the following.  Never play any flavor of SoC with more than 4.  More than that and the game breaks down to the point of boredom.  Avoid playing with whiners or AP types.  And finally, only play base Settlers when you're teaching someone the game.  Seafarers and C&K are just plain superior.

After more than 500 games played (mostly online), I can say that for experienced player this game is very well balanced. It's all about where you put your first settlements: if you know what you're doing, you cannot made a mistake.
Once you figure out what numbers can roll how often, even the dice doesn't add to randomness to much. It can surprise sometimes, but for me that's one of the joys of this game (I'll always remember game where we had like 6 two rolled and one 6 :D ).

Understandable why it's so popular but not my cup of tea.  Trading isn't a great balancing mechanic, and while my intro game with friends was ok, the first "real" game being the Mayfair run "Big Game" at Gencon 2013 turned me off this completely.

Part of me wants to rate this a 10. Another part of me is still kinda burnt out on it despite not having played it in several years.
Irregardless of rating, this is probably the greatest boardgame of all time.

edit: why is this only ranked #60 overall?! I guess I'll have to do my part and rate it a 10.

edit: just played vanilla Settlers again recently. The game is way more luck driven than I recall. From now on I refuse to play it without both C&K and Seafarers.

RATING: 8
My first euro from way back in the mid 90's.  Very fun with lots of interaction and great with new players.  Some randomness and the trading is fun.  Not a perfect game and a lot depends on the group's willingness to trade (shouldn't usually be a problem) and players' initial placement of their roads and settlement.  Maybe a little nostalgia here, but it's still so classic and great fun.

So far I've played this twice with 4 people and both times it took about 3 hours.  Now, everyone says it should only take 45 minutes to 1 hour so I will keep trying with it but right now it isn't so high on my list.  (that said, if it did only take 45 minutes to an hour, I would rate it much higher).

RATING: 6
I've never seen what the fuss was about. it struck me as a game with a painfully luck factor dressed up as a strategic challenge. The number of die rolls in the whole game are low enough that I frequently saw peopl with 6, 7, and 8 tiles just painfully watch 11, 12, 4, 3, 2, come up on the dice and lose, lose, lose ...

It was still kind of fun, not a problem per se, just seemed to fill some nice in gaming culture that I never quite understood. I was playing Um Reifenbreite around the same time and somehow it appealed to me a lot - even mor eluck, but it never pretended otherwise, nor drew a huge following of worshippers and torunaments at game cons and so on, just a plain simple luck fest of a cycle racing game ;-)

RATING: 10
I love playing Catan. I was first introduced to the game around the same time it came out on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. I think Catan can be a little hard as a first-time play for non-gamers. The game itself is deep with options, but they don't overwhelm so I think a couple of play throughs will really up the familiarity and comfort. One drawback I have is the minimum 3-person requirement. I have a hard enough time some times getting another person to play let alone two.

Quite enjoyable, even tho I rarely win.  Good gateway game.  I recommend giving first-timers a city and a settlement to start; it may also be good play without the development cards for the first game.  Teuber's 2-player version was pretty good, too (one play thus far).

One of the best gateway games because it is accessible (relatively easy rules) and there's very little downtime since you receive resources and trade on everyone's turn.  This one was notable for me because I had fun playing regardless of whether I won or lost. 

I still find this one fun, and a great way to bring new people into the hobby.  My one warning is that the game can get way too long if played with more than 4.

This was my gateway game. The first board game I'd played since my Monopoly and Battleship-based childhood that made me realise what I'd been missing out on. I had no idea there was any other way of making games other than roll to move. Subsequent German games I've tried don't even use Dice! Germans are so clever. :) Anyone that tries to deny the importance of Settlers to this hobby is either lying to themself or has just had unfortunate experiences playing this with bad groups. This game is a classic. I'm already completely sick of it, but I owe it so much.

One of the first Euro-style games I've played, and it is still one of the best introductory board games out there. It offers a great balance of luck and skill – but that isn't to say the dice can completely ruin a game's fun.

I love that the game offers a way to mitigate the amount of luck involved by allowing players the opportunity to spread their settlements across all options, granting them access to each of the possible die rolls. Trading is fun and keeps players interacting with one another. 

The modular board creates a new game every time.

Really, this game covers a lot of aspects that are present in hundreds of Euro-style games. If I have a friend who wants to get into board games, I will almost always introduce them to this one first.

(> 20 plays) Settlers is a good gateway game, although I must admit that I don't play "vanilla" settlers anymore, as I'm kind of burnt out on this one.

Another old standby that doesn't do much for me.  Too luck-based.  Even though the luck of the dice should balance out over the course of the game, people who benefit from lucky rolls in the beginning can lock the others out of the best spots.  Too long a game for that level of frustration!

Like a lot of gamers out there, I owe a great debt to Catan. It is one of the reasons I got into boardgaming in the first place.

And that's probably the best thing about Catan: its simple rules, attractive components, short play time, fun trading mechanic, and rather friendly atmosphere mean that Catan is a superb introduction to the wonderful world of boardgaming. There's also relatively little down time in Catan, as you can potentially collect resources on anyone's turn (and turns don't take very long, anyway.) It can hold people's attention.

For the veteran board gamer, however, Catan falls short. Everything is really chance-dependent. That's not necessarily a deal-breaker (I love Eldritch Horror, after all!) but the problem is that there is a paucity of interesting decisions to be made. After you've picked where your first two settlements are, there's basically nothing you can do to tilt the odds further in your favor. The opening setup is interesting and requires a lot of thought, but after that you more or less sit back and let the dice happen. 

There's also a bad snowball effect--the player who is able to grab additional early settlements and cities (i.e., the player who had lucky early die rolls) stands the best chance of getting even more resources, and so forth. This can somewhat be rectified by all the other players refusing to trade with the leading player--but then a core mechanic of the game is destroyed if the players aren't trading. 

All in all, Catan will always have a soft spot in my heart as an excellent introduction to boardgaming. But once that introduction has been made, Catan itself can be left behind.

This is a remarkable gateway game.  Easy to learn and addictive.  Lots of chance and easily suffers from analysis paralysis, but those negatives don't overshadow the simple fun and tension this game creates.  My sister-in-law gave this to us many years ago, and it definitely elevated all of our board gaming interest to a new level.  We played like 80 games of it that first year.  Now, the original pales in comparison to the Seafarers expansion, which provides for the same gameplay with infinite board varieties.  Still, we always introduce the original first to friends, and we've introduced numerous friends to this.  A great game, especially for casual or newer gamers.

RATING: 6
Traded away 9/14

I can see why this kicked off the German Game craze, but for me it's just not that fun. In a 4-player game, 1 player inevitably gets stuck at 4 VP's, doesn't produce much, and sits there with almost nothing to do for 45+ minutes. Not a great time.

With 3 players the board is more open, but trading is harder with only 2 trading partners.

With 5, the board is once again open, but building on every turn makes the 7-card max basically worthless

6 is too long and too crowded.

Cities/Knights is excruciatingly long, and Seafarers adds some stuff that's basically the same as the base game, only played on blue hexes.

RATING: 4.2
Cant see what the big fuss is about? The luck factor is huge. Chuck the dice, hope the fruit machine comes up all cherries for you, then pull your cards and unleash them on someone at the table you don't like. Nice hey? The game is entertaining and simple to play with a slick German design theme, which explains why so many people like it, but once again, little or no control over your destiny etc. Not much to be gained from this from anyone looking for a serious gaming experience. Must however be given credit for being one of the first Euro games that attracted a lot of new gamers to the hobby.

RATING: 8
Really fun, but not as good as C&K.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The low rating for me is due to a few things. First, I dislike the setup time for this game. Second, table bumps can ruin this game. I don't like games that play better with expensive third party accessories (like a hex grid that the pieces can fit into to prevent jostling). Third, the game plays a little too simply for my tastes. And finally, it doesn't play well at two-player in my opinion. That is not a direct fault of the game, but as I play much of my games at 2 player, this falls flat in that area. I have little desire to play this and never suggest it on game nights.

It's fun unless you get unlucky with resources or if you are surrounded and cannot expand anymore. With four players it happens most of the time to a least one player that he has no chance of winning anymore halfway through the game. With three players it's not that bad.

Ah, how many Thanksgiving weekends have I spent playing game after game of Settlers? There are certain people with whom I am always willing to play this game. I think I prefer to play with three players; with three, it's easy to win with only the simple strategy of making sure your starting locations cover all five resources. It becomes more challenging with more players--however, the potential for getting "locked in" to one corner of the board also increases.

Innovative, but the ability to get completely screwed based on die rolls really takes alot of the fun out of it for me.  Nothing worse than watching a game for 2 hours because you can't get any of resources that you need.

The one that started my "modern era" of boardgaming for me, and I still enjoy it, in spite of fairly frequent play.  What caught my attention immediately was the lack of downtime. Even if it wasn't your turn, you were actively involved in resource gathering and trades -- pretty revolutionary at the time.  Also the first modern game I got my parents to play willingly.  Pretty much the prototype of "make the best of what you get" games, which I particularly enjoy.

What is it with people and Settlers of Catan?? I’ve never understood the hype and why people love this game so much. I played it 3-4 times and every play has been chaotic with players arguing and holding grudges. And then that annoying trading part!

“You have clay?”
“No, you have sheep?”
“No, but I have stone!”

I would never dream of buying this game myself. If friends ask me if I want to play it, I only join if there are no other games to play.

An oldie but a goodie. The wild randomness of the dice used to piss me off so I "borrowed" an idea I saw for sale on eBay once and made a deck of cards to represent the roll of 2 dice instead (e.g. 1 card for 12, 2 cards for 11 etc). Works a charm for this and Starfarers as well.

Catan's pretty much the game that everyone gravitates to once they go past 'classics' like Monopoly, Cluedo or Risk. It's a game that while I do enjoy playing, grinds me a lot. Once you know you're just not going to win, it's a 30-60 minute grind of rolling, trading and building in a futile attempt to salvage something from a lost position. It is a good game though, I just have many better games to choose in a situation where Catan would be played.

I feel this game suffers from a lower rating from me because I never get to play it with more people.

With trading, these issues may balance out, but everyone I know is already soured on it for the most part.

SoC isn't a perfect game.  It's not even a game that I like to play often.  A string of dice rolls that go in someone's favor will almost always give them the game since the rich get richer.  However, no other game I have has as much power to pull in non-gamers.  SoC's blend of building, trading, and conquering new territory is amazingly engaging for most people.  It's not until you've played it several times that its flaws appear, but by that time you can migrate budding gamers over to Puerto Rico.  ;-)

09/02/09: This game was just kind of OK to me. It was fun, but I don't think I'll clamor to get it on the table in the future. If someone else wants to play it I'll join in. I came to this game late though. I've owned it for a long time, but only recently played it for the first time. I know it was a revolutionary game for its time, but I'd played many modern games before I played this one, so it seemed kind of like a plain vanilla euro to me -- nothing bad, but nothing terribly compelling.

Apr 2011: Traded this away for Dice Town.

Settlers is fun.  I know it's a landmark game, but I have to admit the more I play it the less I like it.  Maybe I've just had odd games, but so much depends on the dice rolls and the game can quickly become very boring if your numbers just won't come up (even if you've positioned well!).  So much is determined by the initial placement that, having played it a few times, it often feels like we're just playing out a predetermined script after the first settlements go down.

This game is not bad, I just don't like it very much. I think it is a bit boring. Sometimes you just get screwed by the dice but not in a spectacular way like in Risk ("WOW!

I've played a few games of this so far and don't find it to be a very interesting game. It feels to random and I don't like the trading aspect. In my last game people wouldn't trade with me because they didn't want to help me, even when I offered extremely good trades, when I couldn't get the goods I needed I simply couldn't do anything. Also by building many of our building 3 spaces apart we quickly locked up the entire island so you couldn't build anywhere.

A classic game that still captures the heart of many, Catan, unfortunately, do not survive long. After one gameplay with my board game group, we found out that this game is really luck-based and so limiting. This might be a good family game, an introductory game for your new kids and friends, but for sure this would sit long just like a typical classic shelf-warmer, dust gathering game.

A game that (to me) seems to get better and better each time we play.  I don't find myself getting tired of it.  We play it just often enough to keep it freshly at the top of our selection list.  When we game, we think Settlers first.  You have to CONVINCE the group to play something else.

One of the very few games that my gaming group (such as it is) asked to replay immediately. There's shouting, stomping, and victorious yells: this game is awesome. UPDATE: The Asobrain implementation -- especially with variant maps -- is phenomenal. UPDATE: Keeping it as a 9 for now, but to be frank I am bored of base Settlers. I always insist on playing C&K when possible, and preferably with some of the more exotic scenarios rather than the original hex board.

Yeah, I built this one too, though I did some math and worked it out so that my board has 5 players.
(We use an extra rule for 5 players that when a 7 is rolled, you are still safe at 8 cards, instead of just 7. It seems to work just fine.)

THE classic game of the 90's. Belongs in every game collection. I still play this fairly often - just the basic game alone has surely cracked 100 plays, and throw in all the variants and expansions and this is an incredible system.
---
Version Notes: Overall, I think the 2005-ish re-issue of Die Siedler von Catan from Kosmos - featuering plastic pieces - is the most attractive, funcational version of the game. It has bright, pleasing graphics, the smaller resource cards are easy to manage, and the plastic inserts are the most functional inserts ever for a game. It is in German, though. But every version has its charms, even going back to the borderline-ugly Mayfair 1st and 2nd printings (the ones that used photos - I don't actually own either of those printings, but I'd like to just to add to my collection). The 2007 Mayfair edition (the bigger box) is probably the nicest version that Mayfair has done, and is comparable and even superior in some ways to the 2005 Kosmos edition, the first time Mayfair has gone their own way  and done something at least as good as Kosmos. It also has the advantage of being in English. I generally like Mayfair's 3rd printing better than most players - I think it's a nice, distinct set with its own flavor apart from the other versions - but I'd also agree that it's overall not as graphically effective as the other versions, being a little dark.

This is the only game that I'm willing to give a 10.  Settlers does have minor flaws, but it's still the king.  No other game draws more people into the board gaming hobby, and no other game comes off the shelf more than Settlers.  I hope that everyone interested in board gaming will give this masterpiece its due.  Klaus Teuber hit the ball out of the park when he designed this game.

This was my introduction to german style games.  At the time, it was amazing.  It'll probably always have a bit of a soft spot in my heart.  

But now that I have more experience with the hobby, I just don't find the game that entertaining.  The "gateway" nature of the game means I usually only play with non-gamers.  That in turn means that the game is usually filled with frustrating distractions, confusion, and interminable trading phases.  Although I have no issue with the die rolling (even though I'm not usually a die-rolling person), I don't like the table-talk and kingmaking that the Robber induces on frequent sevens.  It's essentially a decent light Eurogame with some of my least favorite aspects of Monopoly and Risk tacked on.

With beginners, I'd rather play Ticket to Ride.  With gamers, I'd rather play something with more strategy and depth.  

Also, this game has been know to start nasty fights if played while intoxicated.

My first Eurogame. Bought this back in '96, Mayfair Edition. Had 2 copies 'cos I wanted to do 8 players with the the funky peanut map. Basic SoC was a good game, but it is dated now.

Yeah, I know. It was my first Euro love - german version purchased from Games People Play way back. I haven't played it to death, so I still love a good game of it. 

I probably am technically breaking the description for the "10" rating. It is true that I don't play this much, so a game of it is generally welcomed. The 10 largely reflects my admiration for both that the game was my gateway into the whole world of Euros, and the mechanics it introduced to me.

The first Eurogame I ever played is still one of my favorites. There is a slight problem in the game with The Robber remaining in one place for too long (if a seven isn't rolled, it's difficult - though not impossible to move him) which can take away from the fun of the game for whoever is unlucky enough to have a settlement near him. Overall, the game is a fascinating and exciting tile-based game.

Update: Lowered my rating from 7 to 6. This was my first Euro and I have many fond memories of it, but I've found many other far superior games since and I can't say I've wanted to play Catan very often recently. I actually enjoy the two player card game much more than the original.

Update: Lowered my rating from 6 to 4 after a recent play. This game relies far too much on dice which can present the unfortunate situation of sitting around turn after turn with nothing to do. And while many people have commented on the luck of the dice, might I just add that working your ass off to collect three ore and then getting a worthless soldier card from the random-draw resource deck doesn't help the game. I have a hard time imagining myself wanting to pull this off the shelf again anytime soon. I'll always be thankful to this game for introducing me to the wider world of board games, but there are much better games out there and I can't see myself wanting to play this again.

RATING: 6.5
I can't say I don't like the game... But there's one thing I really hate about this game... the feeling you have of not doing anything when the dices are not rolling for you. When it's YOUR turn to play and you can't do anything... no one wants to trade with you... you just watch everyone else play... that says everything.

I think the expansions changed that feeling. You have more control on you destiny, there are more ways to win. I enjoy playing Seafarers expansion. I wouldn't play without it now.

A good introduction game for new players.

I have a mixed feeling about this game. Still eager to play when someone suggests it... but do not enjoy every game of it.

A resource management game that a bit too much based on luck. At least for my tastes. I had games where I stomped 3 other players simply because I got awesome rolls and they didn't. In other games I lost only because I barely produced any resources in 6 turns in a row, despite having decent hexes under my control (5,6,8) while people who controlled 11 and 12 kept getting their one after another. Freak luck maybe, but this side of mechanics really turns me off. Overall, a very slight improvement over say Monopoly.

I've heard lots of hate, and lots of love for this game.  I grew up playing it, and although I now prefer less political and more strategic games, this will always be a great game to me.  It's my favorite trading game I've ever played by far.  
One negative: I always played with my parents' copy, which was quite old.  Once it was thoroughly worn out, we had to update.  I have to say, the artwork in the new version is tacky and cartoonish.  Not good at all.  I really miss the old cards and tiles.

RATING: 6
Nice interaction during trading.
Basic development cards aren't very exiting. Much better with "Cities and Knights".
It seems that some times, it can be very hard to get the 13 points and the game can last way too long (3 hours...)
Barbarians are cool feature, but being hit by them slow the game donw, and is probbaly a losse for the player being hit. May be not for noobs...

Main issue is that most of the game is played when you first put your buildings on the board...
I'll keep it to retest the base game someday

If you are behind, no way to come back... and that sucks

I use this game as an introduction to board gaming as it is such an easy game to pick up. The game works best with 3 players as 4 can be a bit crowded, but it also works with 2 players. To do this you create 2 separate islands with the same resources and same odds but with different merchants. When a 7 is rolled, instead of using the robbers, switch merchants. This works really well as the merchants allow for a HUGE advantage. 

A fun game to play for a few rounds, however after that game play can get a bit repetitive. 

Fun game with an unexpected amount of strategy.

Generally overrated. Play with experts only. Play with Cities&Knights expansion!

The trouble is that in most games that I played it was clear after 30min who would win, yet it took another 90 min just to find out for sure. Phew! The game is ok if all participating players know the game well and are clever enough to set themselves up properly. It is usually bad for the entire game if someone manages to have both initial settlements on the same big number - for either this player will win if that number occur es often or that player wont stand a chance if the number occurs not all.

For me there are just too many turns of roll the dice, think a bit, do nothing, say next.

A classic that should be in the top ten. Many NEWNEWNEWBUYBUYBUYERS find this game 'dated', which is absurd really. Dated in what sense? How? Not only do I owe Settlers my entire existence as a game hobbyist, but it is a fantastic game that manages to appeal to both the strategic gamer and those who have only played mainstream games. As the groupthink wheel slowly turns and the NEWNEWNEWERS get sick of the 10-mechanics-and-a-pasted-theme Euros, when the simple, elegant loveliness of the classic Euros comes back in fashion, Settlers will return, slaughter the suitors and reclaim its crown. 

I love the dice. They add a tension and risk management to what might otherwise have been a dull resource conversion game (as if we need another one of those). 

COPY AND PASTE FROM MY GEEKLIST RANT:

Settlers of Catan's slide towards the bottom of the top 100 is proof again of the silliness of BGG's ratings system and its bias in favor of new-and-shiny games over the classics. Like Monopoly (which is also much better than BGG gives it credit for), Chess, and dozens of other older games, Settlers of Catan's popularity, age, and ubiquity work against it having a higher rating, but it is still one of the best introductory games and one of my favorite Eurogames. 

The saturated, consumerist board game market, with dozens of new releases every week, encourages players to shallowly rate games after one or two plays--which makes no sense since it often takes several plays to internalize the rules for even a simple game to the point where a player can focus on actually playing the game well. Market saturation encourages us to "take his word for it" and rate with the group (many members of which will be doing the same thing) so we that can unwrap the next package. 

Coupled with the saturated market is BGG's stranglehold on board game culture. The dominance of one information-outlet is not conducive to a free thinking environment, even in the case of user-generated content websites like BGG. A glimpse through the comments section for any top-100 game shows that raters are often repeating or paraphrasing the comments and judgements of other raters. Absolute democracy, which under-informed (because few of us have time enough to play any but our favorite games more than once or twice), user-generated content websites often resemble, encourages groupthink and the tyranny of the single persuasive voice. The practice that a few well known "game critics" have of passing judgement or rating games after a single play is intellectually dishonest and ethically suspect. 

Don't get me wrong, I love BGG and spend too much time here looking for new games, but the ratings system has never been much use to me beyond providing a starting point for game research. Giving anything but the most minor significance to which game lies where on the scale is the equivalent of basing judgements of worth and value on the results of a popularity contest. 

A thousand unwise voices rolled into one do not necessarily become one wise voice. It's too bad that Settlers may not show up on the first page of the top 100; it is a fantastic game, and one that I will play any time and anywhere.

I came to Settlers maybe a year or two into my gaming career, and as such, I think I have a very different view of the game whose first great gaming love was Settlers.

I've just never really enjoyed playing it. But I think I understand the game's popularity. It meshes together several different mechanics (one of which, importantly, is trading) in a simple and clean package, with enough luck that even new players can win. I can see how coming from a lifetime of Parker Bros. games this feels like the pinnacle of gaming.

As I said above, I think one of the reasons this game is so beloved is that it incorporates trading. There are plenty of trading games out there, but often that's ALL they are. Settlers, to this day, is one of the few games that is a hybrid board manipulation/building and trading game. I wish there were more games like this - I really believe trading being a part of a bigger whole is what has made this game so irreplaceable for many, many people.

That said, trading is one of the reasons I don't enjoy Settlers. Trading feels incredibly limited here - most of the time, people don't have anything to trade you, and if they do, they might have one of it and you just make very straightforward trades. You almost never have the opportunity to feel like you've got the upper hand on someone, like you're sneakily making a really excellent trade for yourself, or like you're making a bad trade for you because you're desperate for something (this really only happens if people have been denying you because you're in the lead). It's just too cut and dry for my tastes. Hell, Bohnanza has more variable and exciting deals.

I do like that resources always feel scarce and valuable. In my experience, you never tend to stockpile resources like you do in other games so losing a resource always feels like it's doing real harm.

But to me, it's always felt like the most interesting choice you make is made at the beginning when you place your initial settlements, and after that you're at the mercy of the dice (your rolls and other people's). It really feels like the die is the determining factor all too often (and the game runs too long for me to be okay with that). It's pretty easy for one player to get locked out of winning the game early on due to some bad rolls, and then just have to sit there watching everyone else expand. Blech.

And then there's the games that run some three hours for no good reason. Ughhhh.

I can be talked into playing this, but really, I'd be happy to never play again.

I love this game.  It's got everything our family likes: high interaction, some strategy, some luck, and it's FUN. I know a lot of people around here say that it sucks, it's had its day....blah, blah, blah.  I really don't care; it was a great game fifteen years ago and it's still a great game.  I brought it down to a 9 because it's got ugly components.  However, the 3-D set is a solid 10, and that's the one we play with anyway.

Ah yes ... Klaus Teuber's smash hit, The Settlers of Catan (or as I like to call it, "Rolling for Resources").  The overwhelming influence of luck in this game really limits one's ability to strategize or make meaningful choices in general.  Resource collection is slow and painful, determined primarily by dice rolling and to a lesser extent, by whether one can entice others to trade.  Based on what one manages to collect and hold on to (keeping in mind that one is fucked over periodically by the robber), it is usually very obvious on any given turn what one should build/do.  Yes, I understand that this might seem overly simplistic, that there are multiple strategies to earning victory points besides building/upgrading settlements, such as vying for "Longest Road" or "Largest Army", or gathering Development cards, but which of these options can be pursued effectively comes down to the roll of the dice.  Perhaps the variety of potential choices is part of the appeal for gamers, while the simplified decision-making makes this fun for non-gamers as well.  In summary, a very overrated game, but still worthy of respect, since it has introduced many a gamer to the wide world of (far better) Euro games.

I originally played this game at Gen Con in 1995.  It's hard to believe it's been 10 years since the game that set off the German board game revolution came out!  Unfortunately, the randomness and the "you're screwed from the start" aspect turns me off compared to modern variants like Attika.  Still, you have to respect it for being the game that reinvented board games.

You know you've found a true board gamer when they say that they've moved on from Settlers. I still think Settlers is a good game with a lot to offer, especially to non-gamers. Still one of the best implementations of trading in a game. The die-rolling, while it can be fun in a way, is a major negative, as it can reward or punish players randomly. It's not my first choice of game (or second), but I will still play from time to time.

decent game, but nothing special.  I don't enjoy the type of interaction with trading the cards.  The interaction is similar to bohnanza in a way.  The use of dice combined with the trading aspect make this game for casual gamers.  There isn't much strategy involved and the players don't have much control over the anything unless they are willing to form alliances, collude with other players, be well liked enough.  3 of the most important aspects (trading of supplies, moving the robber, rolling of dice) are out of the player's control to an extent, which is why I don't care much for the game.  If I had to play this game as a gateway game to introduce boardgames to friends, I would.  That's about the only time I would be interested though.

This might be a classic, but as is the case with a lot of other classics, that does not mean that it's a good game. I think that it might have been awesome before 2000, but nowadays there are so many other, much better, games to play! This game does have a couple of good mechanics which also help new players (like dice rolling and random card drawing), but I think that it takes too long for what it is and that the dice roll can screw you over a bit too much sometimes. I can be persuaded to play it again if I'm in the right mood, but I would rather play something else as I think that there are lot of other better eurogames out there!

I always forget how much fun this game is when the trading is going and everyone has a chance to win. My only gripe is usually someone is just out of it and has to suffer along. And even though the time passes quickly, it is a somewhat longer game that isn't especially exciting for an hour or so until people get close to winning. The end game is great when everyone needs just one more turn to win; but the investment is so high to get there with so much dice rolling mediating the players with an edge. 

It is showing its age to me. There I said it.

This was one of the first games that got us into the hobby. A visiting friend brought it while in town on the Fourth of July in 2009. We loved the game and in fact made a copy ourselves which got a few plays. Eventually we forgot about the game until we discovered the full depth of board games at Free Comic Book day at our FLCGS. We were excited to get a copy of Settlers as a wedding present in 2011; however, with so many other games we rarely get this to a table. It is still in the collection for when people we meet and become friends with mention "Have you heard about this game called Settlers of Something?". We can pull it out and show them before moving on to another gateway game that we enjoy more.

This is simply a classic.  No other game changed board gaming more than Catan.  Without this game most of us would never have gotten into modern board gaming.

This is also the most deceptively cut throat euro out there.  For a game with "no conflict", I have seen more arguments and hurt feelings during this game than any other I've played.  And it's awesome.  I may not be able to attack you directly, but when I cut you off with my roads and then refuse to trade you that wheat you need after I played the "Monopoly" card and took all of yours...classic.

This game gets a lot of hate, but there is a reason so many people have played it.  The most common criticism is that initial placement is the most important aspect and then it's all luck and dice rolls.  I disagree.  This is a negotiation game.  All other game mechanics revolve around the trade mechanic.  Victory or defeat is all based on how well you can trade and convince other players to give you the resources you need to win.  If you play thinking that you can ignore this and win through mechanics alone, you are playing wrong.

Catan opened up the Euro gaming world to me. The strategy and gameplay really interested me to this whole new genre.

http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: Game changes each time with different strategies and initial placement of colonies and roads.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. Lots of resource and card management. Throughout the game there are a lot of lucky dice rolls, but how you deal with the resources you have and trading will determine how well you do.

3) Player interaction:  Lots of player interaction with the dice rolls and trading as well as blocking on the board.

4) Components/artwork: Great components and the board if very cool.

5) Game length/complexity: Good game length. It can drag on at times and dice rolls will not go your way can be frustrating. However you can lower vp total if you want a quicker game. 


Bottom Line: FUN way to spend an evening. You can easily teach it to new players and there is some strategy and tough decisions as well as great fun as you roll dice and keep getting a "12" :)

RATING: 7.5
This is one of my favorites to bring out when there are 3 or 4 players at my house.  An excellent game that involves a touch of strategy, a forward-thinking perspective, and a lot of player interaction.

I only use the Event Cards for this - I think it speeds the game up by quite a bit, as there is the possibility with a few of the cards to reward EVERYONE playing with a resource card - which is usually a good thing.

This is one of the few games out there that can be played "AS IS".  What I mean by that is that there is no need for any house rules or other variants.  It is a very well balanced and finely designed game that does not need tweaking or modifications to make it play "better".  Not saying that is bad, but if you don't like to have to keep track of a bunch of house rules (Monopoly, Descent, etc.), then this game is perfect for you.

This game is also single-handedly responsible for the worst one-line cliche in all of gamedom - "I have wood for your sheep."  Although it is still funny to say, even if you aren't a Beavis and Butthead type fan.

A classic. I've logged quite a few plays, but can't rank it too highly because I think some of the mechanics are quite flawed. Being robbed early on is a major setback, and there aren't enough dice rolls in a game to ensure the statistically likely rolls are represented as they should be.

will play anytime, but the dice roll determining production is SOOOO important to the flow of the game that the randomness detracts from the fun elements. I too often find myself shaking my head at the dice, which is my own problem, but indicative that the game is too dependent upon the production roll.

My first "modern" board game that got me hooked back into the hobby.  I couldn't get enough of this game at first.  The negotiation, the race to points, multiple ways to win, modular board, etc.  

However, as I played it more and more I noticed that the game can be pretty punishing to new/semi-new players.  If they pick a bad spot at the get-go they could be in for a really boring hour of just getting creamed.

Also, stop trying to trade me your sheep.  No one wants your sheep.

Roll and collect in a form prettier, yet less interesting than Monopoly. The leader and loser are almost always determined by the first round. The rest is a waste of time.

My first play of Settlers left me bored.. and never been interested since, despite many attempts to get me to play. I do not understand the popularity of this game. There are just so many other better games out there. This one gets shoved in my face often, though, since it's a major hit among non-gamers.

As much as I like the game I cant't give it a 10. It's far too luck-driven. You may be a cunning tactician and be capable of the niftiest of tricks: If 8 rolls half as much as 6 does and 10 rolls never, you don't stand a chance.

Nice game, but far too much luck.  Games can drag so badly just because of a bad starting position and a series of bad rolls of the dice.  Or the game can zip by so unfairly it is hardly challenging.  I'll play it, but it's not near my favorite.

RATING: 5
Maybe this rating is a bit harsh, but it failed as a gateway game. My wife's reaction was lukewarm, my sister hated it... nobody would choose this over Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne, etc. 

This game might improve if I played it with the right crowd, but right now, it collects dust while my family and friends ask for more intriguing titles.

Update: traded away along with the 5-6 expansion for Pandemic.

My copy was the village bicycle for awhile when I was in college; it was probably played by upwards of 50 different people *before* I became more serious about board games.  Fortunately, it's still complete and in surprisingly good shape (worn, but not unplayably so).  As with many other gamers of my generation, this was the first German board game that I played.  I still enjoy it quite a bit, but since I've overplayed it to some extent, I don't like playing it more than once a month or so.  This 8 rating is more historic than anything else, at least at this time.

I found a copy of someone's math problem set in the box (ACM95, for friends reading this to whom that might have meaning).  It was there for at least 2 years before I found it.  I hope the guy didn't have to redo the whole homework set.

A great game but like Monopoly is better with multiple players. It is a great intro game for people new to Euro Games, but it wears thin quickly. Placement dictates who will win the game 90% of the time. For added fun there are many expansions, but start with the 5-6 player expansion first and then Cities and Knights.

RATING: 4.5
So Much praised, that I finally bought it:
Not very addictive, and we hardly ever play it, owning other games (similar in duration and complexity), imho much better, like Yspahan, Modern Art, Princes of Florence...
Another major drawback for me is the excessive importance of the dice.
Overall Catan is more a mass-market not-very-balanced-and-enjoyable family game (like Risk or Monopoly) than a true beautiful and enjoyable eurogame.

Yep, it's Catan.

Good, but those dice rolls though. I swear something statistically absurd happens every play-through, which often turns the game's core strategy on its head.

Probably the best game to get people who are beginners in the world of tabletop games and those who enjoy more weighty games.  A great balance between strategy and luck so those not advanced can still get the upper hand and have a fighting chance.

RATING: 6
This is a fun and easy to teach game.  Yet it can be unbalanced in favor of the player or two who get to place their settlements first.  Often the board layout is such that a few prime locations exist, with valuable geography under high probability numbers.  Players choosing later can be very hard pressed to win.  Add to this a rich-get-richer problem, and the source of our love-hate relationship with this classic become clear.

Most games have some element of chance, this game seems to exaggerate the role of chance.  I think the initial setup is a huge part of this exaggeration.

RATING: 7.3
Main Positives: Attractive game! Even the components for certain versions is getting better. It encourages interaction which is important.

Fun Factor: High to Medium
Complexity: Medium
Replayability: Yes

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
It gets its boring moments like not being able to do anything all because of unlucky dice rolls but it shines when players interact especially during the trading part of the game.

A good game, maybe too much "luck power" but still strategy has a great menaning unless your opponents rolls a "12" for 4 times in a row...

Decent game and a good one to get people started on in board game world. First one I ever played but it loses its luster after a couple rounds. It starts becoming the same thing after each game and doesn't seem to have a lot of variety to it. Sometimes the games can last too long because of the dice rolls and tile placements. If you find you enjoy it, it is best to get an expansion with it I think. That being said, I certainly wont turn down a round of Catan

When I first opened up the box, I was intimidated by all the rulebooks.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the gameplay is not complicated.  The game makes interesting use of dice roll statistics, although this can be frustrating too.  Players doing well tend to keep doing better; it can be tough to catch up.  But there always seems to be at least one elusive resource for each player.  We have played with 3 players, with 6 players (with the expansion), and with the second 2-player variant listed on Mayfair's website (each player plays only one color).  We greatly prefer the game with more than 2, since that allows players to trade cards with each other.

RATING: 5
(5/2011) I've played a couple of times in recent weeks. The experience has cemented my matured opinion of the game. Blah. Manila crushes it for fun and gateway value while still being an interesting game. So many other games are just plain better. The negotiation is limp. The decisions are almost false. The playtime can drag.
(2/2/10) This and San Juan make me question how I do my rankings. On the one hand, I want to rate games on a scale of how interesting I find them. On the other, I find that I want to rate them according how good they are at being what they are. Settlers is THE 'family' Euro. Luck, social interaction, a little screwage without player elimination, and tons of fun, all in an hour. I'll play it with newbies any day of the week. But will I bring it to game night? Unlikely.

Original comment: Great game. I love the interaction. The components are beautiful (although the tiles could be thicker and fit better in the frame on the new edition). A rich game without insanely complicated rules. I'm new to eurogames, so this one was a big eye-opener for me (pretty trite story I know). While I can imagine tiring of it ever so slightly, I think I will alway enjoy playing it with first-timers who still think monopoly is a good boardgame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like Settlers of Catan but I rate it only 5 because for me it's too light and definitely too random. It's a nice filler, especially because it's not too long. But I think it'a a great family game - you can play it with your kids and both you and them will be satisfied.

RATING: 7
As a wargamer and roleplayer who favors historical or fantasy settings, I resisted playing this game for some time. Recently, I finally broke down and played the game with all the hype.  I must admit, I enjoyed it, particularly the extorting of resources from a player to avoid targeting them with the robber (is that legal?...well, we we did it!)  The only thing I didn't like is the absolute abstraction of it all.  The game system is simple and elegant, but I personally have a hard time getting into a game that doesn't realistically (at some level) depict anything.  Even Memior 44, which is hardly realistic, at least allows to me feel like I'm involved in something concrete.  I guess I'll stick with my wargames.

Not my favorite game, and one that I still don't own, despite it being a classic.  Could be partly because of my first game, in which the owner did not explain the rules fully -- or well.  But I'm not big on trading games, which is the heart of this one. It really comes down to the group of players making or breaking the experience.  And it's a bit long for my taste.  If I ever do pick it up, it will probably be the Star Trek version, which has a more interesting theme to my, and some interesting power cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

What can I say?  It's the game that got me into this hobby.  Looking back, my guess is that it's the distinctly NON-euro elements (dice rolling, robber) that were able to make the cross over to the American audience and introduce so many players to other euro-games.  Our last play of this was excruciatingly slow, which is what happens if certain resources fall on certain numbers.  

I almost always want to play this with Cities & Knights.

:sugar: :( :( :) :) There's easier gateway games; there's quicker short games; there's more interesting strategy games. There's games where a bad run of dice doesn't doom you. There's games that fulfill all of the above requirements that support fewer than 3 or more than 4 players out of the box. If Settlers wasn't the first mover in the marketplace of mass-market German-style boardgames it probably wouldn't have the rep it does. If you're looking for a first toe in the water, consider Ticket To Ride, Carcassonne, Scotland Yard, Pandemic, Dominion or Samarkand: Routes To Riches instead.

A classic!  This game really turned my wife and I onto German games so it deserves an honorific 10. One problem with this game is that the luck of the dice can severely set back your strategy and you find yourself hoping it isn't going to be one of those dice-dominated games.

We like to use a "dice deck" to solve the above problem: a deck of 36 cards labelled 2-12 in the right proportions.

RATING: 8
Like so many others, for me Catan was the "gateway game" that brought me into the wider world of table tops past risk and monopoly.  

It rates a solid 7 for 

1) having an accessible shallow learning curve that's easy to pick up in less than 10 minutes
2) for being balanced enough to have multiple different paths to victory
3)for often forcing cooperating and trading between the players. 
4) and of course, for having a ton of map and number variation so you're never playing the same game twice.

As a downside, the game falls on the side of a little too random in my book.  There will be some play sessions where you swear your numbers will never come up.  The person who wins probably had a good strategy, but also wins with a fair amount of luck.  Yes this makes the game more accessible for some novice players, but it also makes it the kind of game that I'm more reluctant to walk into.  

I've found that the "Oh I just got screwed by bad rolls" mindset is mitigated when you:

A) make the map bigger with expansion sets
B) increase the number of victory points required to win

However, this can greatly extend the length of the game depending on how efficient your opponents end their turn

Birthday gift 2008 from Brittney.
This game shows its strength because it is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, yet I love it and keep coming back for more. It creates intense rivalries that do not exist outside of this game among my friends.

I am pretty sick of this game at the moment. I need to take a nice long break. It's frustrating for me that this is the game that gets requested most often by my fiance and my friends. There are so many other games I would rather play.

RATING: 8.5
Random resource generation? Eh, not really. You take control of nodes as a gambled investment on gaining resources. You always know the odds something will be rolled, so it's a very economic bidding game in this way. 

That's why it's balanced - it's for repeated plays. Play this with the same group and it won't matter if you go 2 games in a row not getting many resources, because the next 2 games may play out much different. And the routes to victory (especially in expansions) becomes so fleshed out that maximum resource generation isn't as required.


---


Has so many mechanics within. Games that have better mechanics also sacrifice elements that Catan weaves together. A strong game. You can play it if you're in the mood for trading, building things from resources, area control, and so on. Not many games can give you that.

The variety of gameplay in settlers makes it a game most gaming groups won't be too worried to play, because whatever gaming mood they are in, it's likely Catan will give them what they want. And if their gaming mood changes next week, Catan may still have what they want. At least a little bit of it. 

That makes this game continually hit the table. It's one we usually are cool with playing no matter what mood we're in, because it has a little bit of something for every mood. Not many games can do that.

A classic.  Better with 4 then with 3, since with 3 players a lot more seems to depend on the die rolls.

RATING: 4
I'm sure this was a relatively good game 20 years ago, but now that there are dozens of games I'd rather play, I find it annoying it still sees so much play.

Its flaws have been discussed at length by others, but just to state the biggest ones:

1. The dice rolls are quite overwhelming in this game, especially considering the economic snowballing in this game. Players who get good dice rolls early are at a disproportionate advantage, and similarly players who get bad rolls early are at a huge disadvantage.

2. The solution the game uses for this problem is to incorporate a bash-the-leader/take that mechanism via the robber. Unfortunately, this just uses one bad mechanic (i.e. bash-the-leader) to cover up another (i.e. randomness/runaway leader).

3. There are literally turns where you get to make no choices. It's not even that unlikely for that to happen multiple turns in a row.

Probably a 4, but we called sheep 'Dolly' back when this was the only game we had, and that never really got old and is worth about a point. (Update: Not anymore it isn't.)

I have fond memories of opening this game straight from the hobby shop, setting it up, and freaking out about the *unbelievably complex* rules.  Then bringing it to my friends' apartment and practically needing to run out for smelling salts.

Like tons of other people here, I'm very happy I found this game and for the dozen or so times we played it, it was amazing.  But then came Puerto Rico, then Power Grid, and nobody has shown the slightest bit of interest since.  I don't blame them.

I've been noticing this oddly Monopoly-esque backlash against Catan recently. Popular things tend to get picked on, I guess.

Which is a shame, because Catan was and still is a great introductory board game, and a great game in its own right. Yes, it relies a little bit too much on luck, and yes, you can get screwed over by bad starting placement, but you can overcome this with clever negotiations against people and judicial use of the robber. It tends to run a little long, especially with 4 players, but it's not a big deal.

I kinda like this game, though not as much as I like the card game version. I find the boardgame a bit boring sometimes since the chances of getting the right resources seem to be smaller than in the card game, thus resolving in situations where the players do nothing but roll the dice for resource and then their turn ends. But then again, these two games are quite diffrent from eachother and there's nothing wrong with the board game, though I DO prefer the cards...

I've only played this with an older group of mine. It was the only game they cared to play. Unfortunately, I was bored by this game rather quickly. I won more often than I didn't (six, eights, fives and nines - get to a 3:1 and do your utmost to ensure owning the longest road). I was no longer asked to play. This is the same group who were confounded by Illuminati. Perhaps with a better group, the game would've played better. However, the base mechanics of SoC leave much to be desired imho. I may eventually own this just to have around though - great for casuals.

I'm looking for one, only one trading game and since this one is so popular, I'm really thinking about it. I took a look at Traders of Genoa but the popularity of Catan is overwhelming. On the other hand, the game is not language-neutral so I'd need the French version and Filosofia is overpricing it big time and not supporting it very well compared to Mayfair. I have mixed feelings as I find the production values very low and I like beautiful games, which Catan is not.

One of my all time favourites. In my opinion perfect balance between luck and skill, a new player can in some cases beat a more experienced one but strategy and tactics still makes big diffrence. Almost no downtime thanks to the production mechanic where you get to draw cards and trade in other player turns. Player interaction mechanics through the bandit, trade and area control works really good.

It's literally just one step above Monopoly except with roll and move it's roll and reap. You roll your dice you reap your rewards. The trading aspect is very basic and I have yet to be in a game where it doesn't turn into a passive-aggressive embargo war where you just horde your resources.

Like many others, this is where it all began for me. I loved it as the base game, then we got the Seafarers expansion which we never played with until we got Cities and Knights as well. Those two expansions in addition to the 5-6 player extension allowed for massive sprawling boards of epic proportions where we implemented exploration and sailed into the ocean to discover land. The games typically lasted upwards of three hours or so, but I would no longer play it any other way. It is too bland without a bunch of unique rules.

After playing on and off for years on various phone/tablets, I broke down and bought the board game to play with my kids.  It's too heady for my 5-year-old, but both my 7 and 10 year old daughters enjoyed it.  The game, which runs a little longer than some of our favorites (Forbidden Island, Ticket To Ride) was perfect for myself and the 10-year-old.  The 7-year-old had a good time but was a bit jacked up during play.  I'm not sure if it was because she was losing interest or just being 7.  Either way, we completed the first game and I got a thumb's up from both kids.  

Update, in future game plays, both the 7 and 10 year old had a good time.  Once they fully understood the game, what it takes to win, and could estimate how much time was left (because the youngest gets a bit bored), it became more enjoyable.  Since they like this game, I'm thinking Stone Age will be our next purchase.

Everyone just seems to love this game. And for good reason. It is fun. Deep enough for serious gamers and with enough luck for casual gamers. Play this and you may never play monopoly and its like again.

The Seafarers expansion is enjoyable and easy to add on. The cities and knights expansion has a ton of rules, adding to an already large set, and is not recommended for the not-so-serious gamer group. 

The 5-6 player expansions are nice because they allow for a bigger party, but the game tends to slow down too much for our tastes with the higher number of players. It seems like eons between turns. I would recommend keeping it to 3 or 4 players.

If you deploy properly in the first turns, you can play in a mediocre way and still win.  Mess up on the first turn and no amount of brilliant play can recover the situation.  Dear Wife and I play more Carcassonne now, and it has a more ding-dong down-to-the-wire feel about it.

"Catan" was one of my early board gaming experiences, and perhaps I wasn't up to the task when I tackled it. Whatever the reason, I found the game exceedingly dry and dull. Trading seems to lie at the heart of it, but nobody at my table wanted to trade with anyone. Thus, we just kind of played in isolation, taking our turns until the game was finally finished. It left me never wanting to play again, but I don't feel I can really bring the hammer down since I knew so little of board gaming back then. Maybe I'd like it more if I played it now? Dunno, but I doubt I'll find out.

RATING: 7
My first German game, the allure died off only after two months of regular full day (read noon to the wee hours, we had sessions ending at 5 AM for a while there) play sessions with everyone I know and I have easily logged over 100 games of this. I still enjoy dragging this out every once in a while. Siedler mainly has a niche for the very casual atmosphere it creates, plenty of time for table talk, banter, and such during the game, one of the reasons it has such broad cross-over appeal methinks. I made the mistake of playing this with a deck of dice for a period of time, essentially trying to turn this into something that it shouldn't be, I'm back to the dice again, and the game has been getting some more play.

This game is interesting in that unlike most modern gateway games, it is actually very prone to position-destroying mistakes when you first set up the board and stake your initial claim. Most people who like it tend to play it a fair bit, especially when they first get it, and in that setting the random boards and initial set-up are a good deal of the allure, but it does tend to make the game a bit dicey when you mix "serious" gamers with newer players, as it is very easy to sink yourself with a poor initial placement and end up sitting around for the game doing a lot of nothing because of that. I would go so far as to say that the initial placement is at least half of the game, with another 1/4 being trading skills and board play and the final 1/4 being luck of the roll and development draw. Take it for what it's worth. I probably wouldn't like it as much as I do if I played it for the first time today, but I do have fond memories of this one and still enjoy pulling it out on occasion with the right group.

If you don't have cards, you can't build.  You can't get cards unless your numbers come up.  So, this game is entirely based on luck.  It takes no skill to build on the best spots... and even that doesn't always win as the nature of luck means you can see a string of ten 11's in a row.  This is a great concept, but you need to accept that this game offers very little real control to the players.

This game will always have a place for me, being the game that got me properly into board games (i.e. beyond regular family board games).  I think it's a fantastic gateway board game that has a very fast learning curve.  It is let down a bit by lack of depth in tactics once everyone reaches a certain level of understanding of the game's mechanics.  Comment based on 60+ plays.

Settlers of Catan is among my first boardgames along Tikal. It has been a really big hit in its time and I think it's fun today. The excessive dependence from luck in the game could be a problem, but it is a good starting point for people who has never played boardgames before.

We play Catan with our own House Rules concerning the Cities-expansion. We do not use the Knights portion of the expansion, only the cities, because we wanted to create a commerce and development centered gaming experience. 

A rarely played game but always has its own place on the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
F&%k all the elitist, snotnose backlash this game gets from people who think they've "moved on" to supposedly superior fare like PUERTO RICO- SETTLERS is the definitive Eurogame and the absolute best in its class, a truly transcendant title that encompasses the best that gaming has to offer.  Direct and meaningful player interaction, luck and strategy, long term planning and situational flexibility, competition, and a sense of narrative development serve to ensure that SETTLERS will long outlive the 5000 or so inferior European designs that have followed in its wake.  This is truly one of the watershed titles in the hobby on par with DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING in terms of industry impact, accessibility, and paradigm shifting.  It saddens me to see folks say how they've somehow burned out on SETTLERS when this is one of the rare games that has virtually unlimited replayability and is almost always a unique and fun experience.  You don't like the dice?  Go do Sudoku puzzles and cram your statistics textbook up your ass.  The dice make the game dramatic, variable, and it forces players to adapt and adjust throughout the game.  With trading, you are _never_ screwed unless you're one of those shrewish gamers who's afraid to speak up at the table to get what you want.  Without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever published and a timeless classic.

I am tempted to give it a 6 but that was only because when I bought it the game was sitting second in the world ratings chart I use.

A modern day classic as most everyone knows. This game got my brother and sister-in-law hooked on their first try. Watching people discover Settlers and have their eyes opened to Eurogames is an amazing thing. Although to be honest I think Settlers is better as a second-rung gateway game as the rules explanation can be a bit long for a first experience. Having said that I've seen inexperienced kids as young as 7 play and understand this game (with a little coaching).

I have always been a board game geek, but I lacked the people to play with as most of my friends are not in to gaming. I like to read about all the games, and see which ones I would like to play. Well, I took a chance on Settlers. I aquired a copy, and got 2 of my friends together ( the third guy backed out, he was tired ). Well, we all caught on to the game fast, and played it 4 times in a row, until it was just past 1 am. Each game was close, and we all loved it. This weekend, we are going to play again. This game is awesome!

Catan does something that no other board game does for me, and that's mixing player interaction with individual turns well. Of course it might feel like there's downtime sometimes when people aren't trading, but I don't feel bored when I play like some games with individual turns do. I like Catan, but I like lots of other games better.

This is the game that got me hooked on board games.  I played board games occasionally before this.  After Catan, I became a board game junkie.  I stumbled across it when it showed up on the BGG hotness chart one day for some reason or another.  Excellent game to bring people into the hobby, but the 3-4 player min/max is very limiting--you have to have just that many people around to play.  I like the game enough to also own it on the iOS and XBox360.

RATING: 4
Good gateway game, but definitely not for me.

Pros: 
- Easy to learn
- interesting mechanic for new table top gamers
- Trading aspect can bring out good social interactions

Cons:
- Too many dead turns. Most games have it bad enough waiting for other people's turns. Having nothing to do on your own turn due to RNG/robber makes for unpleasant play.
- Frontloaded decision making. A good chunk of the strategic play is frontloaded. The setup is (or at least feels) extremely important and starting a game from behind feels bad. Large Hate aspect here too.
- Poor scaling. Game plays extremely differently with different number of players. The board size remains the same, but players increase. With 4 players the board is very cramped, with 2, you have much more 

Overall, the biggest Con is the number and prevalence of hate mechanics which leads to feeling bad (even on your own turn!). There are explicit hate mechanics (using robber. stealing away the longest road. knight cards, monopoly cards) as well as un-escapable ones that are just a core part of the game (blocking people off during setup/expanding, esp at larger player counts).

The main draw then becomes enjoying RNG and dice rolling or trading, which is not enough for me.

The resource adquisition method is so random and relentless that makes me feel a mere observator of my own games. Even when I win. It severely damages the flow and elegance of the game.

RATING: 7
This boardgame is based on board control and resource management.

I prefer playing this with the cards instead of rolling the dice. The stack will have one 2 card (representing a die roll of two), two cards with a 3 (representing 2 dice adding up to a three.) Make sure you put the appropriate number of cards in the deck to the odds of rolling a particular number (more for 7 than 2 or 12).

Classic. Good social game, although a bit too much luck dependent. (I have not tried the dice deck to reduce the element of luck) Its strongest aspect is the high level of player interaction.

Scandinavian version of the game (true for all my expansions as well).

RATING: 6
The official rules lead to a game that plays too long for what it delivers. Tweaking it to play faster makes it fun. My tweak is that if a player rolls dice and wouldn't get any resources, they get to pick any resource they want and get 1 unit of it. Just the player who rolled the dice, not everyone.

Early in the game, this tweak happens to give an advantage to the player who has the worst territories (ones that get rolled least). Late in the game, a player with good territories will reap more rewards than whoever's relying on the tweak.

Ah, the gateway game.  This was where it started for me, to a certain extent.  I like settlers.  The computer version is wonderful, as it removes setup completely, which can be somewhat arduous.

It is a game that I will always love to play even though that stupid robber always seems to get rolled. I love the way the game plays and the interactions between the players. It is a definite must buy for someone starting their collection out if you are like me and got started with monopoly.

While a great game with three or four players, I really wish it was designed to work well with two players. However, lately I've been playing with the Borko two-player variant, which is simply excellent. It makes SoC playable by two.

I like that this game totally changes each time you play.  Your strategy from one game to the next can totally vary based on the tiles on the board.  And the more players you've got, the trickier it gets.  Another cool economics with a twist game.

Played on my iTouch - fun game!  I'm disappointed in the production quality of the 4th edition that I own, though. Thin cards, relatively thin tiles, and the ocean "edges" warped easily.
As a F2F game -- I can see how this has become a beloved (in some cases) gateway game, but having been introduced to it after I've played some other euros, it just didn't excite me as much as I thought it might.  Perhaps more plays will change my opinion, but for now it's a game I enjoy but don't necessarily want to play repeatedly.

The game just doesn't grab me.  Honestly, not sure what the fuss is about.  I've played this several times with different groups but it always seems so bland.  Maybe because no one wants to trade with me (I'm perceived as a threat, when I'm not).

This was my second ‘genuine’ boardgame I ever played (after Avalon Hill’s Civilization), and the experience was not pleasant. I played with 3 players, and we were soon leafing through the rules to establish whether we’d done anything wrong. We were rolling dice and growing, but there wasn't any sense of progression or challenge. I then played a few games with 4 players, and became intimately familiar with the rather annoying phenomenon of getting no useful resources for a long period of time simply because the dice (of course) didn’t land on their expected values. The standard reply is that you need to trade to alleviate this problem, and that the leaders should be excluded from trade. And that brings me to the heart of the issue I have with Settlers. It's not really the fact that 2D6 determine which resources get produced; no, it's that the game relies on people actively recognising that someone is doing too well, and then simply excluding him from participation in the game to a considerable extent until they catch up. I want to feel engaged, not given the proverbial cold shoulder until the rest have decided that it's okay to play with me again.

A second though lesser issue I have is that the game also doesn’t give you a meaningful choice what to with the dice as in, for example, Yspahan or Troyes. Settlers is all about reacting in a fairly uninteresting manner to a completely random input. Your only choice deals with whom to trade, and perhaps, guesstimating considerably, where to place a house. I know of lots of games which [i]do[/i] present me with interesting choices along the way.

Settlers deserves humoungous credit for its relative simplicity, the introduction of resources and being able to trade them with others to the general public, and presence of dice—which are a quite familiar and necessary element to many non-gamers; and so opening the eyes of quite a lot of people to the availability of games other than Monopoly or Risk. But as a [i]game[/i] I find it boring because there is very little to do and grating because I am expected to bash leaders in the most obvious of ways.

If, on the other hand, you and your group like to negotiate... then this title is fairly staple material.

[b]Update[/b] Auctioned off with the rest of the Settlers boardgame paraphernalia. It feels like a great burden has been lifted off my shoulders.

It might leave my top ten eventually, but it will always have a special place in my heart.

Catan is a good game but I think it's just not my cup of tea. It just drags on too long for me and there are so many other games I would choose to play instead. It's a good introduction to games but to be honest I feel like a lot of games end with people frustrated or unhappy. I play to have fun and other games seem to leave everyone happy at the end, I won't choose to play Catan unless someone else wants to play.

Wiem, że jest pojazd po tej grze, prawie jak po Talismanie i Monopoly, ale uważam że to naprawdę świetna gra familijna. Jest to moja pierwsza planszówka, do której mam spory sentyment i zawsze chętnie do niej wracam (ale w tym momencie już tylko z jakimś, choćby mini-dodatkiem). Za każdym razem mamy inne ułożenie planszy, a losowość wyrzuconych oczek na kościach (czasem zupełnie wbrew wszelkim zasadom prawdopodobieństwa) sprawia, że gra wygląda za każdym razem inaczej. Największe emocje są oczywiście przy grze w 4 osoby - dużo możliwości blokowania i rozbudowany handel. Ta gra opiera się na zawieraniu chwilowych sojuszy, za chwilę ich zrywaniu, dużo tu jest negatywnej interakcji, ale w takim pozytywnym tego słowa znaczeniu.

As a fast playing game this is ok, especially for playing with non-gamers. However, once in a while you get the games where the players hardly receives any commodities, which makes the game outlast its welcome by far. Good as a 45 minute, but when it drags, it's really painful.

For some reason, I had a strange aversion to learning this game.  I suppose I thought my other, newer games somehow made Settlers obsolete; that the ideas it introduced had become commonplace.  I'm certainly glad I overcame my reluctance, because the open trading mechanic is unique to my collection, and it's quite novel and fun. 

I may be 17 years late to the party, but the place is still poppin'.

Great game for two couples to play together.  Not too much strategy, but enough to make the game interesting.  Kids are starting to play this one better.  Still learning that trading should be done only if it benefits both people.

I really like settlers but often feel it's missing something.  It's easy to teach people how to play and I like how something can benefit or penalize everybody on every die roll.  The game can seem to drag at times and has that feeling of "missing something" once you've played a lot.  I don't really like the way a player can hide victory points and surprise you at the last minute that they've won.

Gifted away the newer copy my dad gave me to my brother-in-law; kept the old[/b] 

[u][b]My history with Catan[/b][/u]
Since my dad passed away my mother has been slowly trying to clean up the house.  I was helping her out in the guest room where the games were stored and she offered the Catan games to me.  Those games are important to me for a couple reasons. 
[b]1.[/b] Catan is the "gateway" game that got me into gaming and... 
[b]2.[/b] It's the game that reminds me most of my dad who has since passed away and introduced me to the game.  We had [i]many[/i] game plays with these copies with friends and family.  It also includes handwritten notes/summaries of different games we've had, along with a stupid plastic trophy we got out of a grab bag at [url=http://www.mclintocks.com/]F.McLintocks[/url] on a vacation to Morro Bay.  

Not an absolute favorite game, but one I will ALWAYS come back to for those reasons.

We like to randomize the layout of the tiles and the layout of the numbers (for the dice rolls).  This game is important to me because is was my "gateway" game that got me into gaming.  It's also the game that reminds me most of my dad who has since passed away.  Not a favorite game, but one I will ALWAYS come back to for those reasons.

I'm not sure how it happened, but we call the robber the Buddha-bum.  I think my dad started this because he never could remember to call him the robber.  Anyhow, it stuck and we still call it that.  We also have added a cheap dollar-store trophy that goes to the Victor of Catan.

Have played over 100 times, mostly within the first few years that I purchased it. I took it out again recently and the memories flooded back.  I think playing with Cities and Knights is the best competition and adds complexity to keep it interesting for those seasoned players.  Even though it does not get out often it is still a joy to play. My daughter is just now old enough that she can play a good game. So its getting out more often. It will probably always stay a 9 for me as it has earned a spot as the most influential game in bringing me into modern games.

Amazing game, not much can be said that hasn't already been said. This is a must play! If your looking at buying this, don't be put off buy the olden style look of the board and cards. that is where it gets its charm, the Gameplay however is where it gets a hold of you. This one has a place in every board gamer's heart!

I'd heard this was one of the modern classics, and assumed we'd love it.  We've tried several times, but just can't get into it.  My brother says that it was exceptional when it first came out, but pales in comparison to games in the last decade.  I have to agree.

This game is a lot of fun. I have played many games. Still a classic, but now there are so many other great games that compete for my table top. I ended up giving my physical game away and happy to just play the digital game. I still play other Catan games.

This game is a classic family game.  For many it was their gateway to bigger and better things in the euro world.  My biggest complaint with vanilla SoC is the endgame grinds, trading ceases and it seems like many turns are spent rolling dice and passing as the players behind seek to inflict "Take That!" cards or robber assaults on the leader.  C & K increases options but also increases playing time for a game that already overstays its welcome in my opinion.  I am interested in trying some of the elements in Traders & Barbarians that would mitigate some of the luck and give more options for VPs.

It has aged poorly, but it's serves well as a gateway game. I like that you can see your mini empire grow on the board, a visual sense of progress that is missing from many other euro games. And the free flowing trading mechanic remains best-in-class. The random, annoying dice and robber mechanics hurt the game, but this is made up for with excellent interactivity.

RATING: 5
This game seems brilliant at first but gets rather boring after a couple of plays. Usually people get stuck with only getting 1-2 materials and noone will trade so the game more or less locks itself and can go on for hours. I guess or rather hope that the expansions take care of this major flaw in the game. 

Update 091119: Now Settlers have been sold. If I ever want to play it again I guess there are enough copies around to get the chance to play it! No real need to own the game nyself since it is a rather dull game to begin with.

Catan will always hold a special place in my heart as the game that opened my eyes. However, now if I play I much prefer it with the C&K expansion in order to give it a bit more depth. Seafarers isn't as balanced as I would like, so that version sees the least play from me. Catan is still a great starter game that can sway non-gamers, and has a good balance of luck/strategy/interaction to keep things interesting.

RATING: 7
The very one that really got me inte boardgaming and that made me frequently play boardgames.
And the game is still very fun to play, hoard commodities and enjoy when the other players beg at your feet to bargain. Or despair when you realize that your buddy stabs you in the back by trapping you to one corner or even worse feel the hairs rising when there is nothing to do to prevent your opponent from playing the knight that gives him two more points and in a clever strike gain the trade route and on the top of that flash som victory point cards, all this takes him from last place to victory... A thrill each time:-D

Unlike many others, I started my tabletop with wargaming and Warhammer, and met Catan far later. I really enjoyed my first few games, and later my brother bought it, and left it with me.

This is where I fell out of love with it, and decided it is not the game for me. After one two many games where I was left with several turns with nothing to do, I just realised that it very quickly can become a not fun game to play.

The reliance of luck is not only related to whether you win or lose the game, but even worse, bad luck can leave you for several turns of NOTHING to do. That for me breaks this game. When for 2 or 3 turns I can't do anything, this is not fun. I like games where a bit of good or bad luck can decide, but let me take risks, let me try to affect the outcome!

Pro:
- Easy to learn
- Nice feeling of 'building a little empire'
- Trading is nice when people let you

Con:
- Luck that decides whether you can even play.
- Each game very 'samey'
- Not very interesting after the first few games

My introduction to eurogames. I don't understand the apparent hate toward this game. The base game is fun and simple enough to teach new people quickly. The game also has enough expansions to keep veteran players busy for quite a while. If the luck of dice rolls isn't your thing there are decks of cards (I think in the Traders and Barbarians expansion) to take their place for a more even distribution of resources.

A classic game now, easy to learn and play.

Catan was my first game that I ever played and owned, it was very good at introducing me to this side of gaming, but after I got other games I never really wanted to play it again. There are a lot of things that I wish were in this game, BUT some of them were handled in the expansions. I don't like how the game feels with more than three players--it gets too crowded with no way to really stop people from screwing you over if you get put in a bad spot.

Some trading.  Some strategic building.  Lots of good stuff here.

RATING: 5
*The* modern classic.
However, I don't like it that much mainly because attacks only target one specific opponent instead of all of them. That means that coalitions against one player are not only possible, but an inherent and frequent feature of the game. Some may like that, but I don't.

But the team game variant (2 vs. 2 players) which can be played in the Catan Online World doesn't have this problem.
I therefore like it *much* better than the original! :) I'd rate it with a whopping 9 (in combination with both the Cities & Knights and the Seafarers expansion, I have never tried it with just the base game).

No entiendo como me gustó este juego xD Ahora mismo, conociendo la cantidad de euros que existen, me doy cuenta de todos los fallos que tiene este "gran" juego. Con las dos ampliaciones que comento, mejora sustanciablemente, pero aún así... cómo ha triunfado tanto? Y cómo me llego a gustar? Pero bueno, solo por haberme introducido en este mundo, se merece un sitio especial en mi estanteria. Acumulando polvo, sí, pero especial.

I feel like I'm missing something with this game that seems to be hugely popular that I feel is reasonably fun to play but nothing spectacular.

I find if one player starts to pull ahead on victory points it's too hard to catch them up and stop them winning.

How you place your settlements at the start of the game is crucial. If you make a poor job of that then it can screw your whole game up and makes it very difficult to recover.

Edit 06-Mar-2017
With hindsight I feel I judged this game a little too harshly!  Settlers of Catan is over 20 years old and in that context it's a groundbreaking game.  It's a very good gateway game, but it's starting to show its age a little nowadays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Settlers of Catan is a fun game. I like how the board is always different and how it forces trading/iteraction. Like most, this game got my group going and for that i am grateful.

I think it lacks a bit of confrontation, and thus sometimes get's a bit repetive and even a little boring after long a drawn out game.

This game a golden classic. It was a gateway for me (and many others) to the world of boardgaming. I like the interaction between players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Components: Beautiful, durable, functional components in a shoddy box. The most recent addition improves on the original design with an interlocking sea border and distinct art on each tile.

Experience: Update: Played a variant whereby the robber is a fountain, that allows everyone on the fountain to get a resource when that hex produces (if not already on that hex), rather than stopping production on that hex. Makes the game much more enjoyable.

Update: This game hasn't aged well. The very beginning of the game, during initial placement, is the most interesting part. The rest of the game is too capricious. The dice rolls are too random, and even when they give me resources, it might not be at the right time or in the right order. The robber punishes players for being unlucky enough to not build on their own turn; and players use it to target not only the person in the lead, but whoever has built beside them. The Monopoly card is just mean. I dislike that each game has the same goals (get to ten points). Games feel very similar to each other. Too random; too mean; too long.

Previous:
Excellent. The modular board gives each game a distinct flavor, and I find the dice rolling to be a thrill, with players always hoping for the big payoff. There are several different ways to climb to the top; it's very satisfying to finally get an engine going.

It's interesting even during the initial placement, as I scour the board looking for the sweet spots, scarce resources, likely paths, etc.

This game has aged well. Except for one thing that now bothers me greatly (after losing in my most recent game). Like in a game of Risk, when a player starts to lose, that player might have to endure losing for a long time. And during that time, the player will have very few meaningful or interesting decisions. There are so many ways to get hosed in the game; if a player is not in a good position already, with a safety net, then that player can be in for a long, miserable ride.

My first European designer board game. I fell in love with it right away and bought a bunch of expansions for it. Played it many times. A true classic that brought a lot of people to modern boardgames. That said, it feels rather dated now. The winner is often decided as much by the dice as by strategy, which can be frustrating to experienced gamers. It is still worth re-visiting occasionally though. Star Trek Catan, with its character-specific abilities, is a nice improvement on the original design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Odd that so many Eurogamers who seem to despise random elements are so infatuated with Settlers. This has just a little dice-rolling, which ensures that the effect of chance is huge. Bad runs on the six-siders can destroy any good plan -- and there's not too much you can do about it.
Still want to play more, though. :)

29/12/05 update: Played three-player with food stamps yesterday and it was a much better experience. The food stamps didn't undermine the scope for good play, but kept bad dice-rollers in the game. The only way I'd want to play in the future.

This was the game that got me out of mainstream board games and into hobby games. No doubt most gamers can say the same.

During the first few years of playing it, I would have rated it an easy 10. Always willing to play.

Over time however, new games work so much better and many of the mechanics in Catan just seem old, outdated and not fun.

Resource generation being random, means it's all too possible for a player to have a really bad game through no fault of their own.

Having played this so many times over the years, it's now got to the stage I only play this if somebody else picks it and even then, I'd rather not.

Classic, but complicated. People complain about the sometimes stilted gameplay, but you really need the right group to play. If you have people who are willing to trade and/or form some sort of helpful relationship during the game, it can take on a much more interesting cast. Also, it's great that you can expand the game and combine other games with the core set, ostensibly creating an entire world to settle and conquer.

This is one of those games where the randomness can really ruin it. I've played games where certain unlikely combinations of the dice were repeatedly rolled early in the game, which ended up turning it into a frustrating 90 minutes. And it's no better when the luck of the dice favors you; it just becomes a monotonous exercise in clamping down.

If the luck were taken out, I'd raise my rating to a 7 or so.

I played quite a few times and have now decided that I really don't enjoy the game that much. Some plays can be fun, but it can be frustrating when the dice just don't cooperate.

RATING: 9
A very well designed and balanced game. Games can drag a bit between your turn, though and the end can be tedious since it's often clear who is likely to win and who has no chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This is touted as a so-called gateway game, but if it had been my first encounter with the hobby, it would have turned me right off. I find the random resource collection and take that of the robber extremely objectionable mechanics and the game does nothing to evoke the alleged theme that has been pasted on.

The missionary that brought me back to boardgames after spending a lot of time with video games growing up and helped me realize how fun cardboard can be!  This has fallen out of favor with me. It used to be my #1 and a 10, but now I just grow weary of the haggling and the capriciousness of the dice. Still, it is fun to play occasionally for nostalgia.

Still a great game after all these years.  I play just the base game with the fishermen and harbormaster.  Keeps it short, and the little expansions open up the outside of the board.  I only play 4 player and only with people who are willing to wheel and deal .  Otherwise this stays on the shelf.

This hasn't been the hit for us that we hoped given all the excitement about how it changed the world of games.  I know that the die rolling doesn't play the same role as it does in Monopoly and that it's all about playing the odds, but it can be seriously irritating when a 6 just never comes up, you can't get bricks (or whatever) and noone will trade them for you because they know you want them.  Might work better for us when the kids are older, so still prepared for it to surprise me...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A well designed game. The idea were you roll your dice then collect resources is different than most games I've played. Not to mentioned that the goal is just ten points... Which is just enough time for you to get your fair share of fun from the game, but at the same time not to over kill the amount of glory the game deserves. 
This game is also quite simple, meaning this game could be refered to as a gateway game. A gateway game is a game that leads people who pretty much only knows how to play checkers to play more games. Like "Power Grid", ""Ticket to Ride", "The Resistance", and many more.
However I would not give this a ten because... Well, the game really doesn't give you that much options to do things, in other words you can only do what the game itself gives you. 
So if you are a person who likes to kinda sit back and watch the show, or game so to speak (I know I do sometimes) then this is probably the game for you. I know I like to actually legit participate in a game when I play it and this game doesn't really allow it. But I find my own ways to strategise in this which is one of the reasons I gave it such a high rating. This game also deserves a high rating because it is a very, VERY good family game. So if you want to spend more time with your family, this would be a good game for you.

This is another famous gateway game, though it's not a game I find particularly appealing. The dice-rolling in Catan violates my cardinal rule of at most existing to provide slight variance. In Catan, bad luck on the dice can grind your progress to a halt which is a frustrating experience. 

It deserves marks for its accessibility and appeal to people that are typically not heavy gamers, but I usually try to steer the group towards other things after a token playthrough of Catan.

3p: It shines as a 3 player game. I'd give it a 7. Sadly there are way better 3p games out there, so it doesn't get played much.
4-6p: The board gets too crowded and is hard to get anything going if the dice don't favor you. I won't play this game with MORE than 3 players... I'd rather get a root canal!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I rate this game 9 because it is a great game but also considering the following...  We never play it anymore without Seafarers and almost never without Cities and Knights as well.  But Settlers is a terrific game even without the expansions.  The masterful balance of strategy and luck is just right.  You have to be able to adjust your strategy frequently. You can achieve a sense of accomplishment in obtaining one goal and then refocusing your effort to the next development in your game plan. It is exciting to disguise your agenda by building many things at once at the risk of someone (or yourself) rolling a 7 or the risk of an opponent building in your way.  One of my favorite things about this game, however, is to see the blank stare of quite clever people as the game is explained to them for the first time and then seeing how quickly they pick it up when we play.

NEW COPY FOR TRADE...

I like this game, but I hardly play it any more.  My main beef with it is how limiting a starting position can be when playing at the max player limit (4/6).  Add that to the randomness of dice rolls, and the first several turns can reveal your end 30-45 minutes before it happens. Attention to probability mitigates only a portion of this, because there are always going to be placements that are more advantageous than others, especially with a random setup.  Moreover, the dice are what they are--random.

I accidentally traded this for Jambo in a math trade.  I can't say that I regret that trade one bit.  I think I'm just over Catan.

Wow, it still holds its own after ten plus years on the shelf. The game play is clean and simply elegent. I never did get into the expansions. We tried a few, and they just seemed to dilute its greatness. I recommend this game to any noob.

I do not recommend this game to a group  of six people using an expansion while several members look for excuses to get drunk.

Played it once back in 2014 with either 5P or 6P and it took at least four hours. Turned me off from the game entirely until I decided to convince myself whether I still loathe it or not and to give it another shot. Played a 4P game in 75 minutes, feels a lot more manageable and reasonable. Luck-based production is infuriating, but can be mitigated if you're fortunate enough to be able to build along hexes that have a wide range of numbers. I'd play it again with friends who are casual board gamers, but that's about it. Bumping rating from 2.5 to 4.

Resources are too tight, build options too limited, and there is almost no opportunity to screw a runaway leader. Somewhat improved by the expansions. Trading can't be taken seriously or the game will drag, but if you don't take it seriously the winner is essentially random based on who asks for the most from whomever's the most generous. This game hasn't come out of its box for a long time, but I can't quite bring myself to offload it. Not even much use as a gateway anymore, with such things TTR now widely available.

Simple, accessible game to play with non-gamers; strong point is that there is almost no downtime; even though you know what principles you need to follow after a while and therefore it comes to lucky dice, this game remains fun to play; the Seafarers expansion is not necessary, but certainly adds something without increasing complexity and playing time. I almost never play this game without this expansion.

This game is pretty cool. I like the variable set up best as it adds some randomness to the game.  The beginner set up ensures a balanced game, and id a good way to cut your teeth.  However, the true nature of the trading aspect of the game do not become clear until the resources are not as evenly balanced.

Two play variation for base set works very nicely.

Our first eurogame and we still own the German edition. This opened our eyes to the new age of gaming and it changed what we looked for in a game.

But, we like the trading aspect of the game as it keeps the interaction level high.

At first I tought this game was excellent, but nowadays I think this game isn't that good as most people say it is. It is entertaining, that's true, but not very challenging. There's just too much luck involved in this game. The one thing I hate about the game is the trading. It only makes the players with the best cards (possibly due to lucky rolls) even stronger. This doesn't seem fair to me considering the players who had a bad start. Playing without trading would give this game an 8 rating. With the trading it's only a 6.

This is a classic game. I don't think it will ever leave my collection because it's easy to teach, there are multiple strategies, it's got that great gambling sensation when you look forward to each dice roll, and it gets people involved all the time due to having to make trades. 

That being said, a lot of my board gaming friends don't like Catan because they've already played too much of it or they like heavier games or they don't like themeless games. 

3-5 players is the sweet spot. 6 players just takes too long.

After all, it looks nice, and with the add-ons it can be a lot of fun, but too my liking it simply takes too long, especially when you've fallen behind and need to sit it out for two hours with little chance of winning. As a result this game hasn't been played for quite a while, as there are many superior games out there. Trading away to make room for other games.

Dave Loved the game and pushed for a 2nd, 3rd and 4th game - all with the basic setup but swapping colours for the 3rd/4th.

We all won once, Dave also winning a 2nd time.

The trading is the main means of interaction but being able to block off opponents' settlements and striving to win the Longest road card

Luck is a strong factor in deciding the victor, but I think a better player would win more times. 

Strong similarities to Monopoly - the shared board, gathering cards, trading, the 'building an empire' theme - but with tons of advantages (trading more strongly necessiated by the mechanics, opportunities to take down the leader, no knockouts)... I can understand why this game was the one to introduce Eurogaming to America.

Incidentally, the board was slightly bent and caused much aggro.

Prefer playing with the Cities and Knights expansion, although the game tends to drag a bit.  Still the best gateway I've played for non-gamers.

A true classic, and one I'm glad to own.


Expansions owned:
- Seafarers
- Cities and Knights
- Fishermen of Catan
- The Great River
- Event Cards

This game is fine, mostly because most people have now heard of it. The downside is that it relies so much on the dice--and Robber becomes massively frustrating later in the game. We have had to house-rule it to make it more enjoyable.

I don't think Settlers is a bad game... quite the opposite.  There are just so many other games I'd rather play and it is no longer the best gateway game out there.  I find I much prefer playing electronic versions these days as it plays much faster.

Never want to play this again. The most enjoyment I had out of this game was the time I was having cigars out on the balcony with my brother. And I barely even paid attention to the game back then.

The more I play Settlers, the less I enjoy it. The game is simple and good at drawing in new gamers, but the longer the game goes, the more the design frustrates me. The dice mechanic for getting resources just feels so very, very wrong and disappointing. I like dice and do not have an aversion to their use in a game. However, in a game you should always have the power and option to do something on your turn with your die rolls; Settlers denies you this. You could have a Settlers game where nearly all your rolls give you nothing and your opponents are rewarded - leaving you with nothing to do but end you turn. Meanwhile, games like Alien Frontiers and Kingsburg use your die rolls as a mechanic to gain resources, but in those games you always have options for using your dice even if the roll is bad. If I wanted a game with resource management and trading that makes all players active on each others turn, I think I could find a more enjoyable game.

One of the most played games in the modern age of board games, Settlers of Catan (or simply Catan) is a building and bartering game that has you trading with your opponents and collecting resources to build the roads, cities, and settlements to try to win the game. A modern day classic to many who have played it and a game that helped me get back into the world of board games, Catan is a board game I play at least once a year and is so popular that it's even sold at big name retailers like Walmart.  If you have yet to play or want to get someone back into the joy of playing board games, sit down and play Catan, you won't regret it.

Really fun and excellent gateway to Eurogames (is it THE first real Euro?). Beware the dice. With some players the dice feels like a constant problem that just messes up your plans. Use a dice deck for these players. Others will simply see the luck of the dice as just part of the game and will be ok with the base game.

RATING: 5.8
Initial placement is crucial in this game in which you build villages connected by roads. Villages can be turned into cities, which are worth 2 points instead of 1 for a village, and they produce double the amount of resources (wood, stone, sheep, ore, grain). Production is determined by throwing dice. If you have a village or city on a tile with the correct number you obtain resources.

Fun game with high interaction.  For the time it takes to play a round, I would rather play many other games with my core group.  

I do find that this is a good game to break people outside of the more traditional styles of American gaming.

See Seafarers if you are looking to play with more than 3 people.

Catan was truly my gateway game at the early years of the XXI century (i never get to knew Carcassone at the time and, anyway, it won´t qualify) so, it sets another standard point at my rating list.
Englobing just a few more mechanics and set up work than a vintage, Catan has already most of the features of a modern eurogame, though at small level. 
Easy to grasp, with fast playing turns in a suitable short overall playing time and keeping pure chance at low level, it was perhaps the first non abstract game that could provide the feeling of really taking your destiny into your hands while building something.
Nice to go along with family, friends or even maybe light gamers (who knows), Catan still remains a quality product and enjoyable, if one is by now not tired of playing it again and again.

RATING: 5
THE stereotypical "gateway game".  Theme is pasted-on, but there's enough of a challenge for gamers while being easy enough for non-gamers.  Probably best known for the trading mechanics.  I prefer to leave this on the shelf unless I'm trying to introduce non-gamers into gaming.  Otherwise, I'll go for more meaty games.

I'm lowering my rating.  The more I play, the less I enjoy it.  The game seems to last way longer than I prefer, and I grow tired of the randomness.  I still prefer the 10vp goal over the higher vp goal from the expansions, but I think starting with a city and a village (rather than 2 villages) is the way to go.  There's also the Rich Get Richer problem here.

Update: Traded away, as I won't ever recommend it, and plenty of other gamers I know already own it.

A classic but unfortunately not fun for me anymore. Some players will not trade with you and once you remove trading, it becomes as tedious as Monopoly as you wait for your turn to roll dice and build something or hope the dice other people roll fall in your favor. Waiting for half the game or more isn't a fun game at all.

Experience does improve if trading exists but the strategies seem straightforward and are beholden to dice rolls. Look for ways to score points quickest and get a good spread of numbers to maximize the amount of resources you are getting. Often times high numbers are targets for blockage and the small sampling of dice rolls means even lower level numbers can pay off as frequently as higher ones.

Catan!  This will always hold a special place in my gaming heart because it was my first "Euro" type of game that I played.  It is special because it blends strategy and luck fairly well, and being able to trade resources between other players makes for interesting interactions each time.  I would give a higher rating, but I'm trying to balance nostalgia with reason.  Still play this game fairly often, although it is taking a backseat to a lot of newer games that I frankly find to be more fun.

Catan almost reaches the kind of cultural level where I feel like evaluating it is meaningless, like chess, or darts.  This game is fun, but I feel like almost all of the game is in the initial set up and the first few turns.  If this goes very badly for you then you get to sit and watch people try to win Catan.  This is a bit of a fatal flaw in my book, and I only really break this out with very new people, or once a year or so.

Back in 96 this game showed me there was more out there than fantasy and war games.  When I first bought it, I couldn't get enough.  All of my friends kept asking for it to be played.  Fast forward 10 years.  I've played this game a lot, to the point that I don't really want to play it much, but I still do, at least once a year.  Really good game.  Would recommend, even if I know nothing about your tastes, as the game has very broad appeal.  My rating is higher than my true feelings at this point, but there was a time when it was clearly an 8.  Now it is more like a 6 or 7.

Missed the Catan phase that a lot of people start with but got it as a present. The game moved quicker than I thought and had a good amount of player interaction with the robber and trading. I don't think there's much that will open up with the game other than reading the players at the table and setting up in different positions. Still fun and the rules are light enough to explain to our non-gamer friends.

Too much dependence on the dice-roll. You can choose good positions at start, but if in the first few rounds you don't get your numbers on the dice while others do, then they will "surround" you, so you will not be able to expand. And if you cannot expand, it does not matter if later on you get the rolls you want, because you're trapped and you have NO chance of winning.
However, it's a good game to start with boardgames.

This game is hugely popular because of it's accessability to non-gamers.  I can see that but I just don't find enough strategy in it.  Too often a bad series of rolls will leave a player with nothing to do for many turns.  That can get boring.  That won't stop me from playing and from time to time it comes down from the shelf for family night.  I'll take the C&K expansion when I can though.

It's a classic. Sure, there are better games out there, but with the right group Settlers can still be a lot of fun. That said, I think the total time per game, and the down time for each player during play, is out of balance with "what you get to do." I have a copy anyway.

We never regret sitting down to play this game. Very fun but one downside is a poor starting position can be difficult to recover from and it uses two D6 dice and dice can lose you the game. For example, nine and five should roll equally often but they are dice and of course don't neccesarily follow the "odds" leading to a bit of frustration. Traders & Barbarians expansion adds a deck that handles die rolls which does balance things some in this regard.

Catan is not aging well for me.

The decisions you make during the setup round are essentially the most important decisions of the whole game, which makes the rest of the game seem to drag.

There's also a lot of random swings (even if you use a card deck instead of the dice).

Lastly, the end of the game is often a kingmaking situation. What Player A does will decide whether Player B or Player C wins. Even without that, the end drags out as everyone refuses to trade with the leader... slowly getting all players up to the 8-9 point range.

Without a doubt, Catan is far better than the majority of "family board games" that came before. But I think I may be ready to put this one out to pasture, since there are now much better games available--games with none of these issues and a lot more positive aspects besides.

Forever a classic, and the game that got me into board games.  Perfect starter game for those who haven't made the leap from Monopoly to Agricola.

Pros:
Simple to learn and enough luck for beginners to have fun
Variable game board
Rewarding expansion
Trading

Cons:
Too much luck(dice and card deck) for those who love strategy games
5-6 player expansion not included
No 2 player game

Play it till your bored, then buy Cities and Knights.

Very sad when not getting resources, very happy when they come rolling in. Lucky not to have played it much - meaning I'm not tired of it.

Two years later. . . finally played it again. This time with a "food stamp" cube given to anyone who didn't get a resource that dice roll. You can trade food stamp cubes equal to your current number of victory points for any one resource card. Also, no rolls of 7 allowed on the first two rounds. These rules helped a lot!

> Despite having not played this for a long time I do think this gets harshly treated sometimes on BBG. I think it is a great game with a lot more replayability than quite a few higher ranked games. I only rank it a 7 due to burnout from playing it almost every week for about 2 years.

Great intro game, but hard to enjoy as much after playing a lot of other 'euros'.
Still fun ocasionally.

RATING: 3
The single most overrated game imaginable, Settlers is in no way, shape, or form an enjoyable experience. The amount of randomness in tile placement in high which then translates to each player having a number of turns with no meaningful decisions to be made thanks to the die-rolling aspect of it. In addition to its randomness, the trading system and thief placement allows for "kingmaking", making the little strategy that may have already been used go to waste.

Settlers is an absolute classic. It is one of my personal favorites and it is the "gateway game" that allowed me to bring countless new players into gaming. It is the quintessential resource management game. It uses a tile-laying mechanism similar to that of [gameid=58], which ensures a different board layout every game. Players then populate this map with settlements to obtain resources like wood and stone that can be used to build more structures and roads. There are several routes to victory and discovering different strategies and other subtleties of play ensures a high replayability factor. Most importantly, it gives players the opportunity to ask the age-old question, "Do you have wood for sheep?"

I've never played this at a table, but I have 20 plus plays online. Decent game, some important decision making and negotiation, but also a LOT of random luck.

Settlers is a long game and it is decided early.  Be it luck or skill, within the first half hour 2 people will be in contention, one is out of it but still trading cards, and one is living a prolonged waking nightmare.  I don't want anyone to be having a bad time during a game and it happens all too often in settlers.  That, and for some reason, the table talk surrounding this one stinks.  Yes I get it, wood for sheep, hilarious.  DOWNGRADE.

[December 2014 - 7]
The gateway game. Like many, it was one of the first few games I played to get into the hobby. I enjoy it, but the trading and the dice-rolling luck ultimately play too big of a role in the game. Especially with the dice, if your numbers aren't coming up, it means your opponents' numbers likely are, so its sort of double whammy and the gap between the leaders and losers widens (I have the same complaint about Machi Koro). You'd think the trading might balance that, but if you have nothing to trade, because your numbers aren't coming up, then you're out of luck there, too. Meanwhile the leaders can trade and widen the gap. All that wouldn't be so bad if it were a shorter game, but it's a little lengthy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only fun with played with non-pedants, this game is deceptively rule-based. The most fun to be had exists in trading and deception, and then only arises after hefty doses of alcohol. At this point it's not a bad little game.

Most tedious when setting up. The remainder is virtually entirely dice rolls and small trades.

My gateway game. Wonderful. Still play, especially when introducing others to designer boardgames. But prefer it with one or more of its expansions: Seafarers when we want similar gameplay to the base game but with more exploration, and Cities & Knights when we want more depth and complexity. Traders & Barbarians are sometimes thrown in for additional variation.

2017-11-10 Catan is finally starting to fade for me, which is why I am going to downgrade it from an '8' to a '7'.  I no longer actively seek to play it, but can enjoy it when we do.  However, I've found that other games—most notably 7 Wonders—improve on Catan's civilization-building theme by having better mechanics.  E.g., severely mitigating the luck mechanic; reducing the punitive interaction between players, etc.

I didn't play Catan at the height of its popularity. I played much later and it did not do its reputation justice. I found this game very dry and not terribly exciting. The key mechanism is on getting resources through die rolls and if your numbers just so happen to never come up - you're out of luck. It could be argued that you're supposed to plan around this by spreading your towns to the most likely places, or trying to cover a wide spread, etc, but in the early game you have no real say in this.

The trading is okay, but since this is a 'gateway' game, most new players take the 'Monopoly Method' to trading: they just won't. This can be mitigated somewhat with the sea trading spaces, but then once again you're beholden to the mercy of the dice to get the resources you need for those spaces.

Overall, this game just has not stood the test of time. The over-reliance on dice rolls is a complete turn off for the SO and I since there's little you can do to mitigate them. The other aspects of the game did not make up for this failure either.

My first experience with boardgames during my adult life.  Luckily, I am a pretty stubborn chap, so it had not driven me right away from boardgames.  It is simple, it is repetitive, it has a runaway leader problem and the decisions to be made during one's turn are completely obvious.  And it drags on and on and on for far too long.  The only reason I'm not rating it lower is because of its historical importance.

In the past I enjoyed playing the game a lot as it was the first board game I bought. Now I consider the gameplay of The Settlers of Catan as very predictible. Once a player builds the third settlement or the first city, he/she collects resources more frequently. Then, with more resources the player founds another cities/settlements faster than others. This is simply an unstoppable process. What is more, players that didn't manage to expand quickly, collect fewer resources and have no fun. The Settlers of Catan was a kind of basis to create new, much better games so don't waste time on this one.

Settlers of Catan

IMNSHO, this is the best multiplayer negotiation game ever to hit the market!  It has an incredible depth to its strategy that gets overlooked by “gamers” because they dislike the amount of luck in the game.  I used to despise the luck factor because I wanted to win if I was the best player at the table.  Now I'm just as interested in who I get to play with.  and the great amount of luck in Settlers makes the outcome of each game unpredictable even when I am playing with non-gamer friends.  At the same time, I am never bored during these games because the optimal strategy is in continual flux.  I am always amazed by how difficult it is to determine the value of each resource as the game proceeds.  Learning how to negotiate with different types of players is another aspect that never gets boring.  I have played this game well over 50 times and I still enjoy it.  This is unusual for me as I normally get tired of games that I can play with non-gamers after 1 - 3 tries.

What is there to say about the ultimate gateway game?  It’s an incredibly social and competitive game that is just so much fun.  The only criticism is that the 5-6 player expansion really should be part of the base game.  This has fallen of our gaming radar but I would not hesitate to take it out gain if requested.

A classic, gateway game, which is simple enough to be played by non or new gamers. However, high envolvement of dice in the resource production which can be desliked by experienced gamers. Not a game i prefer to bring in the table anymore, but i feel like i have to keep it in my collection,  it will alway be a classic.  Was a  solid 9.5-10, 20 years ago, nowadays it s more like a 7 to me. I m rating an 8, due to the impact it had in gaming history!

I don't like it at all with the Robber.  We have to house rule him into a harvester (mobile village for the player who moves him), with no adverse effect on the 'real' villages bordering the hex.  This game has bombed on first impressions, when a new player does not get good rolls, has no resources, cannot build, and cannot trade.  Wife and daughter like the game though, and it's one of the few they play frequently.

Till I discoverd the 'Cities and Knights' expansion on this game, I thought this is the best game ever made. Strategy, good amount of Luck and Trade. Never want to be a salesman, now I want.
Because it is over with 10 points, it is exciting till the end in 9 out of 10 games. And if it is not exciting that one game: within one hour you play the next game which is.

Great game--it's a good thing packaging doesn't count in our game ratings, though.

I probably would rate this lower, but it was one of the initial games that brought me into the boardgaming world. I just hate the lack of control with the game. There is a total dependence on whether your resource numbers are rolled and if they are not you are screwed.

As much as I like chrome and extra features (C&K here), playing this game plain is still a great way to spend time with people.  Maybe a little hard for a totally new person to understand how to do well, but learning how to play is possible for anyone.  And the randomness of the dice covers up any possible ego bruising as the new person learns to do better.  Everyone would always have won that one game if they had just rolled that 5 or 6 or 8 or 9.

Considered *the* German game by many, sold a bazillion copies and spawned many expansions. Players begin on an island made up of hextiles. Dice are rolled to generate resources, resources are traded and spent to build settlements, cities, roads and resource cards. Victory points are earned for these builds and first to ten points wins. One of the "must own" games. If it has a flaw, it is the dice can reduce a player's role in the game to watching it for 75 minutes.

Updated 3/17/2011:

While I used to enjoy Settlers of Catan, I have come to the conclusion that the level of randomness ruins the game. While it can be enjoyable when all players are positioned well and the rolls are distributed evenly, it can be a totally maddening experience for some players when they're not.

Bad rolls leave some players with few or undesirable resources to swap, resulting in other players having little incentive to participate in trades with them. This can make the game feel mean-spirited to the struggling players, as can situations where other players use the robber to steal and block, preventing them from advancing their position in the game.  This results in an exercise of futility, turn after frustrating turn.

I'm unlikely to play this game very often in the future.

This one was not a very big hit with my family, but I have a bunch of friends who are crazy about it.  I never loved it that much but it's not bad.  At this point though, I am really sick of it as my friends requested it constantly for awhile.  I don't normally mind blocking in games, but in this game it is frustrating, as the person who is able to successfully block the other person is usually determined by random luck.

Very popular with family & non-gamer friends. One of the better "intro to gaming" game out there. Key selling points are: a) it is not difficult for non-gamers to learn & enjoy 2) no 'wait-for-my-turn' downtime 3) no elimination of players 4) various strategies to win 5) good mutual gains from trading & player interaction 6) fast play and little "analysis" factor . Hard to go wrong with this choice. After getting your pals hooked, move them on to bigger & better games! Also, playing settlers gives enough satifaction to satiate that "gamer itch" addiction. Just don't burn out on it... go play something else! Only downside is that is best for 4 and we often end up with 5 for the night...

I've only played a couple games, and accidentally won both (against experienced players!). While I felt like the luck balanced out, the dice slowed the game down (due to an inability to plan ahead), and made it take a bit longer than it ought to be.

Great game, no doubt. All the players are kept involved continously for all the game, but too much dice means to me too much luck... for the others!
Update (vote raised): I admit my hate for it, I can't stand my bad luck with dice (if I've put my towns on 8 and 6, rest assured that a lot of 2 and 12 will be the dice response), but I can't refuse a play... *SOB!*

This is the bread & butter game for much of my gaming circle.  It is almost perfect.  Skill typically wins, but there is always a chance to get lucky.  Even a moderately skilled player has a chance to win despite better players at the table, which makes it fun and competitive for all.  And the board changes every game, so there is no preset optimal build.  Add in the fact that you can trade, you can take hostile action with the robber and that the game punishes hoarding and it is just really well done.

My intro into the Euros and I hardly looked back at the Avalon Hill type games again. Truly groundbreaking in my game playing experience. The idea that you take a turn, and roll the dice, but you may not get resources and your opponents may get them - brilliant! Keeps everyone engaged throughout the game - and nobody is eliminated and can play all the way thru till the end. Wonderful! I love this game and we play it frequently - but we certainly don't play it to death.

This is a game that initially I didn't mind playing, and so introduced it to friends, and so have had 6 player games with 7 year olds at the table, it's that easy to run. Unfortunately, I now don't like it that much, as I just don't get that much out of it. I would avoid 5-6 player games, as this starts extending how long it plays, it can stretch out to the 3 hour mark, or more. I'm sorry, the old "Wood for Sheep" joke just starts to get a little tiresome.

Truly brilliant game design that was a progenitor of countless games to follow. The only flaw is that when you play, one player invariably gets beaten by the dice. He hasn't chosen poor starting numbers -- not notably worse than any other player, anyway -- yet his numbers just don't come up. By halfway into the game, he's just become little more than a prop, trading fodder for the other players to use in trying to achieve victory. The randomness won't bite you every time, but it will bite you some of the time. And for that reason, no matter how much I respect the game as a forefather of the genre, I can't rate it more than an 8.

Ah Catan, a fantastic intro to Euro board games game, which I played far, FAR too much in high school. Definitely a good game, tight rules, and a fair amount of strategy, but gets old after a while. If you need a game for friends to start to play after Risk, Monopoly, Scrabble, you can't go wrong with Catan.

The standard for the Eurogame. This game has stood the test of time, and its popularity is still high. 

A great family game, and is also a great game to play with others that don't play a lot of games (the infamous "Gateway" word). The game is well balanced, well designed, and is just fun to play.  

This is my favorite "family" game.

Ok, this one has been played so much it isn't funny. Since the Cities & Knights expainsion I only find myself playing this one when extreme non-gamers are around (or on the rare occasion of someone that "hates" C&K). I love negotiations games, and in this one you can negotiate about everything. I really enjoy it when some people get upset and talk about cheating when I offer goods to someone for placing the robber on a specific person, or when you "buy the rights" to build a settlement in a certain spot. Brilliant game, but after hundreds of games I really prefer something else.

RATING: 5
The classic "gateway game" for people who aren't gamers. Simple enough to teach the layperson without intimidating them into quitting, and random enough that the novice has a chance against the expert. Once they play this, they'll want to see what the other games on the shelf are like. 

UPDATE: Not sure if it's the plethora of newer Eurogames I've been exposed to since Catan or not, but this game seems stale and out-of-date to me now. Really not digging the randomness added by the dice. A string of unlucky rolls can ruin the experience for one or more players who will sit with few resources and nothing to trade. Rating downgrade.

A classic that most people like. Except that as the years go by, and the more variety of games I play, the less I like this game. It's becoming a "Monopoly" of sorts.

I know, I know... this game is the quintessential introduction game to board gaming. Everyone knows it, some hate it, others love it. I am in the boat that can never turn down a game of Catan! This was seriously the game that opened my eyes to ACUTAL board games, you know, the fun ones. Prior to Catan I thought Hasbro was one of the few companies making board games. WRONG! There are soooo many! WHAT?!??!

Anyways... I very much enjoy trying to convince someone to give me a sheep or wood so I can finally build my road or city. This game has completely replaced Monopoly for me... will never play Monopoly again. This game is just...better!

RATING: 8
Catan is a great way to introduce people to euro board games. The familiar dice roll to start your turn helps make it a great gateway for people only familiar with mass-market, roll-and-move games. It has a nice balance of simplicity and strategy. There is enough luck and interactive trading to keep things from getting stale. The variable setup plus all the expansions give it longevity and great replay value. The best thing we did was sort our pieces and expansion parts into adjustable tackle box flats and pack it all into a carrying case. It's our "Settlers to go" kit. I must have played between 50-100 games of Settlers before we found BGG, so my stats on this game are very under-reported.

I feel that popular opinion on this game is leaning more in my favor these days - the only game of Catan I've ever enjoyed was my first one, when I was new to the hobby. It's resource-generation system is pretty poor, and it's not even high on my 'gateway game' list any more.

Many will argue that it's main selling point is that it encourages trading and keeps it relevant to the core gameplay. While accurate, is this trading actually fun? I need sheep but have wood, so I exchange my wood for your sheep. I now have the sheep that I need. I'd rather have a better system for me to generate my own sheep!

This is a very casual game. I like the trading aspect a lot because, unlike some other games that have a trading element or phase, players actually -need- to trade a lot throughout the game to succeed.

Like many, this was my intro to the world of boardgames 2.0! The player interaction, speed and beauty were all new and fascinating. This doesn't hit the table much anymore, but it's officially a classic for me and I will never turn down a game.

[b]1.4.10 Update:[/b] After being confined to a shelf for the past few years, our most recent play found this classic has lost some of it's glow. It's still a great game, but when compared to some of the newer games, this just takes way too long to set up/play/tear down for the return in enjoyment.

RATING: 5
Was OK at first, but became tiresome for me after a few plays; fun depends on the group and its willingness to trade.  Good potential for interactivity, but my group tended to not trade since we didnt want to help other players too much.  If an essential commodity is scarce due to randomness, a player who has the scarce commodity is even less willing to trade (since they want to use it themselves), and so a bottleneck emerges to strangle trading. But at least the game can move along quickly. The main flaw is that the extent you participate in the game is dependent chiefly on luck, and (to make things worse) is exponentially tied to having luck in the initial few turns.  The result: deadly boring games for those players not initially producing many commodities (esp longer 5-6 player games are terrible)-- there simply isnt enough for these players to do.  Sure, the game is short, so it can have its place, esp. with non- or casual gamers.

I own the french version of Settlers of Catan and the 5-6 player expansion. 

Settlers of Catan is an excellent family game. Settlers of Catan gets played once in a while. My mother even plays Settlers of Catan sometimes which is great. It's her favorite.

Whenever she plays, in most cases I go to my brother's place to play so I get time to spend time with him at the same time. In a lot ogcases she enjoys putting a house on the 2 and the 12, go figure.

*UPDATE*

My brother got his copy of this game, so I don`t have to bring my own. Gave a copy of the 5-6 player expansion. Lately, when we meet, we always play a game. It has become a ritual.

Settlers of Catan is that hamburger you order the first time you go to a certain restaurant, and then you proceed to never order anything else there from then on, despite your friend telling you how much better the other food is, because you know you like it okay, and it's a safe order.

I am that friend, and I hate what that burger has done to you.

At the beginning of my boardgame experience I enjoyed it. Now, the randomness just kills me and makes my annoyed playing this game. Seems like statistics doesn't work in this game ever. Or plays against me. 6 or 8 is never rolled when I'm there, although 3, 4 and 11 are kept rolling and vice versa. Bragging for resources sometimes gets ridiculous. Well, I'm really over it. Will play it only with my "not-a-gamer" friends if they insist.

It's a classic.  After over 100 games (not an exaggeration; I played online) it's not one I'm dying to play anymore, but I can't deny that it is a very good game.

Euro games owe a lot to this game. Didn't like to play it at first, but will not decline a play if asked to. Only downside I see is that you stand no chance at all if your first choice of city was bad or 2 players block you from the start. The idea of trading resources is its main asset that has brought so many people to board games. Praise for that!!

RATING: 7.5
This is a good gateway game for introducing eurogames to uninitiated friends who have only ever played games published by Milton Bradley, Hasbro, or Parker Brothers. After a few dozen plays, game-play is not especially captivating as most decisions are made on auto-pilot. Your initial placements and the dice gods have a lot of influence on who wins. However, due to resource acceleration the end game is often exciting "if I only had one more turn I would have won!" finishes.

1st Euro - or at least Gateway Game to bringing Euro's to US en masse.

Although I am painfully bored of this game having played updwards of 500 games, I can find no room in my heart to give this classic any less than a perfect 10.  I think, for me at least, this was the game that helped bring games from overseas to America and continues to help bring about the mainstream board game revolution that we all hope and pray continues to grow. 

Update: Victorious!  That's right, my countless hours of Catan-ing finally paid dividends...literally.  I took down the Settlers of Catan Mega-Tourney at the Strategicon last week and got 100 bucks to spend on more games.  Yay sheep!!

Update 2: Victorious again! Won the US Settlers Championship at GenCon and got an all expenses paid trip from Mayfair to Germany to represent the good ol' US of A.  I was the highest English speaking finisher coming in at 8th in the world out of 56 competitors from 28 countries.   Awesome experience.  Wouldn't trade it for anything.

My gateway game. As a child, I grew up playing Hotels and Scotland Yard. Then came the dark ages. I got distracted by things that don't matter in life, like education and work. Enlightenment finally came with Catan, having been introduced by my brother-in-law over one Christmas. Catan helped me emerge from my dark ages and I've quickly expanded to several games (primarily euro). Now, life is good again.

RATING: 5
Spiel des Jahres 1995. I respect this game for what it did, how popular it became, and its use as a gateway game.  But, that being said, the most interesting part of this game is the set-up.  From there it is all down hill in a game that practically plays itself and has few meaningful choices. Trades can become interesting on certain set ups, but more often than not, nobody ever seems to have a real strong motivation to trade - thus, making the game a waiting game until you roll the right resources you need.

When I first got this game, I was very enthused to play it.  The test of time has not held up, mainly due to the number of fights I've had while playing (it can be tense).  I have not tried any of the versions of it (although have done some of the expansions to the base game).  Would like to try them so see if this livens it up for me... but the base game is pretty boring.  Add in Seafarers expansion and this would but this up at least a point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
(Not)* Gaming nirvana.  And it gets even better with Cities and Knights!

This game really shines with random hex and chit distribution.  I really love thinking about how to best exploit the limited resources on the map; and throwing down my roads, settlements, and cities in various winding and twisting configurations.  There's no need to worry if an opponent takes a spot I want as long as I set myself up in a good trade position, and not get tempted by the deceptive chits that whisper odds that may never play out.  It's a wheeling and dealing puzzly game where every move is a calculated gamble.  It's a pirate in a merchant's clothing, and I'm always up for a game.

2017 Update after owning the game for ten years: I hate the way you can trap people early in this game and they'll just sit there with nothing to do.  I also get kind of bored waiting for my resources to roll. It feels too slow, even when it goes fast.

RATING: 8
Overall I think this is a terrific game and a fun way to kill some time by engaging in some friendly back-stabbing. There are a few tiny flaws that occasionally get in the way of the game for me, but in general I think the design allows for a nice balance between luck and strategy. And I think luck is as important a part of gameplay as strategy, so I appreciate the attention to balance in games like this. 

The highlights of the game for me are the player interaction (through trading and "unholy alliances") and the resource management. Thinks like the "Longest Road" and "Largest Army" also provide some flexibility to strategy, and reward players for doing more than just building up settlements and cities. Building roads and buying soldiers are an important part of the game, but I think those added bonuses give the game some extra punch. All in all I think the point system is very flexible and allows for players to pursue a variety of strategies, most of which will remain viable for the entire game. 

The only thing I don't like about the game is the way that resource tiles are assigned fixed numbers for dice rolling. I can't tell you how many games have become once sided slaughterfests because the dice refuse to roll anything other than five or ten (and it's always five or ten, never six or eight). In most games I've played one resource will remain scare due to the number system, which is fine and indeed a part of the game, but occasionally a "sheep tyrant" will emerge and destroy us all. When the game takes on a sense of inevitability it becomes a lot less entertaining and rewarding. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
These days it feels too random, but considering I haven't played any game as much as this one, and still enjoy a game now and then, this needs to be rated high. It is an absolute classic. The dice rolls can make or break your game, but there is strategy involved to mitigate some of that. 

This is a game that is extremely easy to teach someone and is a great way to nudge someone into the hobby.

A great gateway game, but also introduced me to a number of issues I have since judged all games by. A player should not be eliminated from a potential win by the beginning turns and a leader should not be able to continue his run towards victory so easily. Sure he can be robbed or denied a trade, but for such a cutthroat style of board setup, the actual chances to screw your neighbor are low. I moved on, although I enjoyed my time in Catan.

60-90m (too long!), best with 4 players. 10+ plays.

Not terribly impressed with the box and component quality.  The frame and tiles always pop up at one corner or another and are thinner and less rigid than I have seen in other games.  Quality would suggest a much lower SRP than $40.  Rather than being about building roads, settlements, etc, the games seems to be more about buying the development cards since you can build your army and collect free VPs.  Also, the robber is a little too powerful and comes into play too frequently.  I want to love this game and will keep playing it, but these features seem to cause a little too much tension at the table.

As a lot of people will say, this is a great gateway game. However, after playing it a lot, and then being introduced to a number of other strategy board games, with each new game I learn the Settlers of Catan falls further on my list. At this point, I can't see ever playing it again unless it's the only game available. I no longer enjoy the game for a number of reasons: (1) the base game only plays 3-4 players, which is an awkward requirement. I'm not a fan of games that can't support a minimum of two players. Also, four players is too crowded and takes too long. Five players (with the expansion) is great because then there is a build phase between every turn. (2) This game is TERRIBLE when it comes to the "everyone gang up on whoever is currently winning!" mentality. No one wants to trade with the player who is winning, and if someone does then usually at least one player will get mad and insist that it's the worst decision ever, even if both players mutually benefit. Furthermore, if you are in first place and everyone stops interacting with you then there isn't much you can do strategy-wise to secure the win. You have to sit back and wait for random numbers to be rolled and hope to get what you need. Otherwise, the game slows down to a crawl until someone else takes over as first player and other players will finally trade with you again. (3) Even when you play the odds and build next to the numbers with the higher probabilities of being rolled, usually those numbers are targeted with the thief, and it's never a guarantee that the number will be rolled and you will get your resources. (4) After playing the game a number of times, even with the expansions, every game starts to feel the same and so, for the time and money commitment, I'd rather play and buy different games.

I know that Settlers is a very popular game and the word in the media is that this is one of the greatest games ever for various reasons. I generally enjoy the game. However I hate to be a downer but I feel like it's the "best game" for people that are non-gamers or just casual gamers. It has a lot of merits but there are some things I don't like about it. For one thing, the game seems to drag because it's tough for players to just accept that no one is going to give them 3 ore or 3 wheat for their one measly wool, and this causes the game to drag. Also I have found that for some reason when people get screwed in this game they tend to be personally hurt. I have seen couples get into fights over this game, so I make a point not to take it very seriously when I play as part of a group with my wife :)

Settlers one weakness as a gateway game is it's set up. With some other gateway games you open map board, pass out pieces, shuffle and pass out cards, and your good to go in under 5 minutes. With Settlers, laying out the hexs and letters on top can intimidate casual gamers.

I'm really starting to dislike this game.  It's way too contentious and suffers fairly badly from a runaway leader problem.

One of the first games that got me into more serious boardgaming; still like to play it occasionally even though I have many others I'd much rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Now a classic I would say.  This is a great game that has interduced so many into the new board game industry.  

The games easy to learn, interactivity and non aggressive theme make it perfect for a family, or new gamers.  The depth of stratagy and complexity of trading maintain it as a reasonable game for experianced gamers.  If I hadn't already played the games a couple hundred times, I probably would still reccommend it to most game sessions.

The citys and knights expansion is still my favorate variant.

The gateway title to euro games. I credit Catan for sparking my interest in board games after a long hiatus. This title is very popular with my friends and always comes out on game night. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Let me preface; I completely respect and admire Settlers for what it has done, and continues to do, to the gaming hobby. However, the gameplay itself never drew me in like other titles have. I find games with heavy negotiation very hit or miss, and with the luck in Catan always seeming to alienate at least one player, depriving them of any fun, its a miss. This sin is even more egregious considering the game has a tendency to drag on and extend their suffering.

This is an engaging game and I like the fact that in 4 player games players are not eliminated.  This has the distinction of being my first official Eurogame. With multiple ways to gain victory points one has to focus on a goal, but at the same time be mindful of that quiet player slowly building, building, building.  It was captivating enough to get me to purchase the expansions. I keep it nearby to expand my friends board game horizons.

I know this game has a reputation of being a classic gateway game and an intro to Euro games, but it's never been my favorite. I like the negotiation and player interaction, but it just doesn't hit the table much. I'll play it and enjoy myself, but it just doesn't tend to be a game I suggest. Purchased from a FLTS.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Still the ultimate gateway in my books.
A little strategy (position of initial settlements), interaction (trading, blocking), tactics (robber, building) and a little luck.

All this in under 90', no real downtime and except in very rare cases all players stay involved.

After a lot of plays my willingness to play has dropped a little (say more like a 6), but in general a rating of 7 seems fair

Too much is dependent on initial placement and dice randomness. Very few important decisions to make after the setup is done, just wait to see how it plays itself out, and it takes far too long for that to be acceptable.

Raised rating with expansions, which add more interesting decisions to play itself. Importance of initial setup still makes things difficult for first-time players.

Played it a lot back in the 90s, but nowadays I don't like it as much as I did then. It just feels kind of trite to me (no surprise, given our sheer number of plays and the development of boardgames in general since then), it almost always plays too long and the dice rolling also isn't very appealing to me. Nevertheless it's a classic we have to give some respect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this game, and taught it to many people.  It remains the best game for introducing non-gamers to gaming, in part because it is very elegantly designed - does a lot with relatively few rules and components.  Also the die rolling, while an annoyance to experienced gamers, does help create some excitement for the general populace.

Even though there is very little strategy left in this for me, I still really enjoy teaching it to new players and watching their learning process.  Plus the trading is still a lot of fun.

A clasic game; which probably diserves a higher rating then I gave it.  However, I found that the initial placment was too importent and could make or break a player before the game even got going.  Also, the sosial aspect of traiding cards can be highly unfair, hence throwing off the balance.

Good game to play with people who wouldn't enjoy heavier offerings. Highly dependent on whom you're playing with, though - avoid ditherers or those who seek to compromise as they will slow the game and make it painful.

RATING: 5
Too much is swayed by what the dice tell you and when. Plus, if you mess up during the two minutes of initial settlement placement, the next forty-five won't mean a thing. The whole enterprise stagnates when a rare resource doesn't enter the game ("Anyone got wheat? Anyone? Still no?), which oddly seems to be intentional. Keep it because others enjoy it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really don't like this game. Still, I can't get rid of it because it's the staple board game for non-hobbyists right now and it does help bridge people over to better games. I just really don't like the randomness of the game. Some games can go great and be very enjoyable, but it seems more often than not that the combination of bad rolls, bad placement opportunities, and stubborn players leads to one or more players effectively getting eliminated because he or she can not do anything.  

It doesn't get much play and so I don't mind the occasional game, but I swear i'll hide it if it starts to get overly suggested.

The game that really got me into board-games - it will always have a special place in my collection as a result. My family adore it too, so have clocked up nearly 40 plays over the last 6 months or so. Works with 3 and 5 (with the expansion), but definitely shines brightest with 4 players.

Played 3 or 4 times with the family. A touch of 'Monopoly' syndrome, which is exactly what we were trying to get away from - i.e. one poor soul always seems to get left behind, unable to build, and is stuck watching someone else follow their sloooow but inevitable path to victory.

Still, it's an appealing game and I can't help thinking we were unlucky in those first few plays.

Update 2017 -- Enough with the badmouthing of this classic.  My previous comments can be summarized,  "I'd rather play checkers with my cat." 

Actually this game is very much like Monopoly.  I think that's why it's such a great gateway.  It has the horror of the "dead-money" player -- just like Monopoly.  It allows senseless, reckless, free trading -- just like Monopoly.  And also, like Monopoly, you pretty much know who is going to win forty minutes before the game is over.  Yawn, Daddy-O, yawn!  It manages to paint the mean, pointlessness of Monopoly onto a resource gathering area control game.  A bridge to escape those types of games.

A great entrance-level game, but too simple for anyone seriously interested in boardgames. I find it exceedingly mind-numbing, and cringe whenever we have people over and someone suggests we pull it out -- which often happens because Settlers is the one everyone knows about and the one everyone has been able to learn easily. Marginally better with Seafarers expansions. Significantly better with Cities and Knights.

A very good game and excellent gateway game.  I came in after the Catan hysteria, so a lot of my friends are burnt out on it, but I enjoy it.  It's one of the best games to introduce to non-gamers.  The rolls can really screw you, but if you are flexible, you can usually find a way to stay competative.  (I've recently had two games of this that have made me reconsider the final statement...as well as drop this game by a full point.  They were two excruciatingly painful games.)  When it's good, it's really, really good, but you can have an occasionally frustrating run of bad dice.

RATING: 8
The granddaddy of gateway games was my personal introduction to modern board games. It was my first euro and I was fascinated by the "victory points" and variable board. Before SoC I didn't know anything existed outside of Monopoly, Risk, Scrabble, etc. However, repeat plays have revealed not all is new and perfect here. Although very good with 4 players, I don't find it works with 3 or 2. The dice can be cruel, making your statistically superior strategy worthless. There can still be a runaway leader problem even with the robber and other players reluctance to trade with the leader. Also, if you happen to get boxed in early in the game there is nothing you can do to catch up.  

Seafarers, Helpers, Fishermen, and 5-6 player expansions included.

RATING: 3
This game is way too luck based for my likes. For new players, it's not a very forgiving game. Poor initial placement of villages is something you can't really recover from. That means that new players, haphazardly placing their villages, will have little chance of winning once they understand what is going on halfway through the game. There are better "intro" games than Settlers, IMO.

Yet another follower-placement game (the First that I've owned, in fact!). It's strength lies in replayability, as the gameboard is never the same. And luck goes the same for that matter!

As this game can be played with 2 players, I strongly recommend to gather up at least the third one. In two player games, there's just no need in trading, which in my opinion is one of the most intriguing aspect of the game as it enforces conversation and diplomacy, which is absent from two-player games.

Totally recommended for fans of games like Carcassonne!

[2016-05-31] I have a love/hate sense of this game. I want it to be better, but I'm not sure how to go about that. 

1. Have the Robber default back to the Desert tile after one round anywhere else. He won't stay long to impede a runaway leader, but he also won't stall an already lagging player.

Trading can result in a more luck-driven, dice rolling grind if no one is willing to trade. Maybe there could be more incentive: 

2. Players may draw a resource card token (per the Welfare variant rules) if they accepted a trade offer made by another player.

I really enjoy this game and the strategy and thinking involved.  Table talk is able to take place when it is not your turn.  We do not get to play very often since at least three players are required.  I would have rated it higher but it takes a long time to play (2 hrs it seems) and adding expansions make it longer.  Maybe if we continue to play it more we can speed up the game but we know when we start a game it is going to get very involved.

Edit: I've increased the rating because as we've played more, the game time has gone down.

Here it is, the game that got me into real board games. For that alone it deserves a high rating. The most unique board that is random every time with many classic game elements including trade, building, dice rolling, and victory points. The artwork and pieces are all high quality, though I'm still a little torn at whether I like the newer version or not.  As for pure gameplay, the dice do matter a fair amount but at least its based on probabilities.  Still, those games where it seems like 4s and 10s are rolled more than an 8 or 6 can be annoying.  I like playing this every so often, it really doesnt get old.

Why does this game work so well?  I can't quite figure out how this game manages to hit every game players initial sweet spot.

But I'll play it now and then for sure.

Almost don't play it anymore. The dice can really hate you and I don't care much for the trading. I like it best with 3 or 5 players; you have more room to place your settlements, so the game flows more smoothly and doesn't bog down towards the end.

Catan is a classic. I don't even need to review this game because everyone has played this game and if you haven't, you actually have and just don't remember that it was called Catan. There are a handful of go-to games out there for me that are easy setup, light-medium weight for chill nights or straight gateway games for new players or people who hate board games because they hate monopoly. This game is very rewarding each time the dice rolls that one resource you have been waiting for the whole game but also extremely punishing if you did not position yourself for success. There is definitely possibility and even probability for a runaway player who just absolutely dominates the round. Also, players positioned poorly will be punished relentlessly for about an hour and have to watch other players accomplish everything they need and more.

Very good strategy board game, not that difficult to learn, yet more challenging and interesting than Monopoly, and with multiple ways of trying to win.  Great player involvement even when it's not your turn.  "[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/150443]Welfare variant[/url]" (= Foodstamps) [[filepage=22173]PDF[/filepage]] is a must to minimize the frustration of randomness and too much dependence on luck, plus speed up the game and prevent runaway leaders (closely related is the [thread=1184279]Poverty is No Shame variant[/thread], which feels more like regular Settlers but just gives players some control over what numbers are rolled - see my thoughts on both [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/15951421#15951421]here[/url]).  Another option is to [thread=134095]roll three dice[/thread] and pick two.  Game play can also be improved and made more even with the Event cards.  I also suggest using a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/15950941#15950941]score track[/url].  

Here's a website that creates `balanced maps' for starting resources, and is even used in some tournaments: [url=http://bettersettlers.com/]bettersettlers.com[/url].

Also owned: 
[gameid=2807] - Base game add-on for playing with five to six players.  As much fun as the base game with three to four players.
[gameid=20038] - Potential to improve Settlers by eliminating some randomness and adding some strategy and events.  The Earthquake event can be a bit harsh early in the game though, so we've ignored that.  Overall, it seems to improve the game and make it more balanced.  This along with the Foodstamp variant are must-plays for Settlers of Catan.

My only modern boardgame for almost 15 years. I still think it's fun. It's a little long for what it is and the modular board only goes so far in limiting the "samey" feeling game-to-game. Still, luck-of-the-roll resource management with trading. Not a bad combo.

I appreciate what this game did for boardgaming. That being said, I'm not a huge fan. If you aren't able to get a good starting position, you are essentially in for an hour of watching yourself lose. Additionally, this game relies too heavily on dice rolls and has no reliable way to mitigate "bad luck".

The game has fallen out of favor with many to modern games. I still like playing it as a gateway game with non-gamers because of the interaction that trading brings. I never play with just the base game though. I always use a larger board (from the expansions) with my personal randomization rules. I needed to have expansions with this game, so -1 point.

I bought this game when it first came out Stateside and I still love it.  I'm a bit of a purist; I prefer the original game to the Seafarers expansion (although I like Cities & Knights).

Best with 3-4.  2 players is fun but feels kinda pointless.  More than 4 and players start using the wooden pieces to spell out "Help Me."

Played and enjoyed the base game ~10 times, but can't stomach it anymore.  It is too simple and i'm not a fan of dice games.  The trading dimension is its saving grace.  Low rating also due to no replayability.  C&K expansion is a big improvement.

Massively over-rated, very luck based game.  Fun if you don't expect strategy to be the primary factor in deciding a winner.

This is a wonderful game; or at least it was for a couple hundred plays. I picked this up on a whim at a comic store down the street to play with my friends before we'd go out drinking. Except we had a hard time leaving the table. Soon we were scheduling Settlers evenings and playing repeatedly till the wee hours. Ah, those competitive nights of playing Settlers when somebody always wanted "one more game."

It seems unfair to rate this game against today's games, but I revere it as the landmark game it is and all the enjoyment it gave me, so I'll bump it up a notch. I'd be hard pressed to sit through a play of it now, however. At least give me Elasund which has a lot more going on. For expansions, I recall Seafarers and Cities & Knights as both being worth it.

This game brought me back into the hobby and, by association, to BGG, so it will always have a place of reverence in my heart.

Until recently, I haven't played Settlers for a few years and had regarded it as, sometimes, a frustrating dice-fest. However, after a fresh play I was struck by how clean and simple the game is.

Some might be confused why I rate this game so low. The reason is that I stick to the description of BGG rating descriptions and I definitely pass on this game if there is anything else available for playing. The main reason for my rating is that the luck is affecting the personal strategy in a way that can simply break your position in the and will make it impossible for to win. Definitely a good game to present to players who only know simple games for instance but not really something that is worth playing for a competitive thrill. I definitely suggest Korsar or Keltis. Those are much better Knizia games in my oppinion.

RATING: 7
A game everyone should try once. Is it a classic? Probably. After the jokes are worn thin, the game endures. Regardless there are plenty of other games I love to play that owe Settlers a royalty check. Or at least a thank you card, most kids leave their folks in a lurch, so don't hold your breath.

Tueber has milked this sucker to the point of irrelevancy and each rendition sells, so I guess it is a bonafide classic. Is it plagiarism to steal from yourself, or just a sign of limited creativity?

This is an excellent game as a game, but it also has a social interaction component that few games offer.  My favorite Settlers story comes from my friend Andy, who played a game in which all his opponents were extremely agreeable when it came to trading ("anyone trade me a sheep and a wood for a wood?  I need a sheep?"  "Sure!")  He was way too smart to do this.  Halfway through the game he realized he was hopelessly behind...

We always call this game "Settlers", but you can't find it using the Search function on BGG if you type in "Settlers".  It's stupid.

The classic gateway game imo. This game got me truly invested into wanting to experience more strategy games. I owe it a lot.

However this game became to repetitive.  Due to the reliance on luck, I have really become turned off by this game. From someone that had most of his strategy based on the social game, it became to common of an occurrence for luck to run the game. I won the first 11 times I played, then would win every other for awhile until I hit a point where I would win like a normal human. 

I really have just played this game too much and have lost interest in the strategy. Great game to get you into strategy gaming, just hard to play consistently once you find others.

Bought the game and 4-6 player expansion for $50-$70 (I forget) MANY years ago. After many games, I started to keep a Hall Of Fame paper where we recorded: Game Length, # of Players, Who won and what position did they place, and Least and Most common Dice Roll #. We have 91 games that we kept record of on the HOF (I won 41 of them :) ). I have played over 100 games of Catan. This has been one of the best game purchases I've ever made. 

BUT, that was years ago. Back then, this game was a 10 easy. Now, with the way games are changing and new mechanics being created, I'd say it's a 7. We still play it, but it doesn't get chosen many times (perhaps because we've played it so many times).

Couple notes:
My gaming group and family aren't big fans of chance, luck/lack of luck, or ganging up on. Therefore, most of the time we played without trading. This was mainly to stop bad players from giving the person winning what they needed to win... Too many times I'd be winning and I'd convince a silly player to trade me a terrible trade and game over. It's not much fun when that happens.

Another variant we did was, we played a lot of game (maybe 50%) without the thief. If you rolled a 7, you just picked someone to steal from. 

Another variant we ALWAYS played with, and I think this helps the game, is that you could negotiate. If you're about to be stolen from, you can ask the thief "what do you want?" He says "wood", you hand him a wood and thus protect your other precious resources. OR he says "wood" and you need wood, so you say "good luck" and then he picks randomly. This addition was always nice to have. 

When we played with the thief, you could negotiate with the thief and say, "I'll give you what you want IF you block my 12 and not my 6" etc... this rule is also great. Everyone is happy. Of course sometimes the thief says, "nice try" and just smacks the thief down on your 6 that has 3 cities on it. BOOM.

So, if you haven't played the game before. Get it. Play it. You'll enjoy it. I don't think you'll get 100 games out of it like I did, but you'll get some good mileage on it.

RATING: 6.5
Despite all the criticism here on BGG, I generally enjoy this game.  One can see immediately why it is considered the quintessential gateway game: it has loads of player interaction and involvement and with resource collection and trading occurring for everyone each turn, everyone stays engaged.  I particularly like that the momentum builds as the game progresses, and when there is not a runaway leader, it is sometimes not clear who will win as the end approaches.  Settlers is clearly a classic deserving of all of its fame.

Having said that, with time I have downgraded my rating from an 8 to a 6.5, as dependency on the dice rolls make's it difficult to control one's destiny, and there sometimes can be a real runaway leader problem.

Optimizing for the right mix of resources (e.g. getting brick and lumber to start), likely resources (likely hexes), and route planning (getting ports, blocking opponents) make for a great mix of strategic elements.

Simple to learn, but yet some strategic death.

The game is marred somewhat by "accumulated advantage", once you fall behind it's hopeless and that's usually obvious to everyone.  If players are paying attention they will cease trading with the leader, which helps to some degree.

Also marred somewhat by too much randomness in the consequences of dice throws and who gets the the resources.

I played this game (and its expansions, Seafarers and Cities & Knights) several times a week for several years. It can be very frustrating when none of your numbers are rolled. 
I use a house rule to mitigate no numbers being rolled especially at the beginning of the game. When you don't get any cards on a roll, you get a penny or other marker. You can trade these markers in on your turn for a resource: you turn in the same number as your current score. These markers can never be taken away and do not count against card limits, etc.
It's been a while since I've played much. My Mayfair 3rd edition is really worn out, so I've collected the various 4th edition game and expansions, with the intent that I'd start playing it occasionally again.

A fun game, but the standard set up is not perfectly balanced. The white player has a real disadvantage from the start. So use random set up. It's also a little bit too hard to catch up on the leader. The good thing is that every one having a great time negotiating.

Really nice. Good and simple play logic. Nice pictures. Fast Enough.

Bad: it need really high attention with starting position or you could have big problems advancing in game.

One of the first "gateway" games I played when getting into the hobby back when I was in college circa 2009. 

Your first choice of where to settle will determine the outcome of the game, which I dislike. Also do not enjoy the dice being so prominent in determining the fate of the game. The dice are why trading exists in Catan, but I don't enjoy trading either. The "building" feels hollow and I'd rather play anything else sans Monopoly. Decision-making feels very limited and each turn is brief and unfulfilling. How about some Uno?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The game is so frustrating.
Worked well as a gateway game, but now I hate it. How can I want to play a game where for 3 full rounds you don't get any resource while the guy with colonies on the 3-4 or even 12 keep gathering goods? How can you want to play a game where you draw knights that let you randomly draw exactly the resource you don't need, and the other guys draw monopoles and free streets?
And of course noone wants to trade with you for just 1 resource, so you're stuck with all but one resource for the thing you want to build... and won't get the one you need for 5 rounds or more, until you can trade 4 for the one you desperately need... if in the meantime noone has rolled a 7.
Wasted time. Wasted energies and frustrations.

Build routes and cities to collect resources, so you can build more routes and cities. Hopefully, the dice go your way or you have some opponents to are open to making trades.

More interesting as a historical artifact than an actual game. An undeniably clever design, but familiarity breeds contempt. 

It shows its age (and I like old games), and it's unbalanced and takes way too long. It's a high-interaction game that I'd rather play against computer opponents. There is no way I'd use this to introduce someone to the hobby, evene if I owned it. But I'll play it on  a dare.

This is THE game, the first german game I played in 1996 and was a total revelation. It literally changed my life, 10 years later and I have nearly 1400 german games.

Such a huge influence on gaming, and Klaus Teuber deserves the rich rewards it's earnt him.

Talk about gateway games...  Like most Americans, this game pretty well ushered in the board game renaissance for my family.  We played the living hell out of this thing and its expansions, but now we never touch it because, well, we've played the living hell out of it.  I've viewed with grudging interest some of the mini-expansions that have been appearing, and hope that/wonder whether those event cards would help "flatten the curve" for the production rolls.  Given the number of actual rolls made in the game, it seems like either 6 or 8 is always missed the whole time!  That's wacky.

Played with: 4-6.

Catan is the essential to everyones board game collection in my opinion.  Easy to learn, easy to play and most importantly it teaches some fundamentals that will hopefully bring new players into other styles of boardgames. 

The BGG rating on this currently a 7 which I believe is fair as the game does become stale after a lot of rounds, and people begin to figure out the best strategies to win games.  That said, I think everyone should own Catan and if you want to help people jump into board games this is the perfect starting point for most people.

I was never exposed to this before bgg, and so I lack the nostalgia.  It was a slow grower, as I usually prefer the less luck oriented games.

My primary introduction to eurogames a number of years ago, Settlers of Catan will always have a place in my heart.  However, the mechanics grow more and more stale to me every year, and there's a little too much 'wait and see what the roll of the dice brings' to make this a top tier strategy game.

The simple fact that you did something and were engaged even when it was not your turn was a revelation to me; this game effectively destroyed roll and move games for me.  One of the first eurogames that I purchased--along with a Ticket to Ride.  Great family game.

A propos of nothing, this is perhaps the game I'd like to play the most (having somehow never played it), given how when any game is mentioned by name in a general culture reference it's any one of the usual 'classics' such as Monopoly or Risk or Sorry!... except when it's Catan. 

Update: This finally made it to the table! And I have to say, it was way overlong for what it is. I can see why it impressed people so much when it vame out, but I have no great desire to play it again.

The game that got me into the hobby.  A friend talked about how she played it with her family.  I just sneered and said, "The Settlers of Catan? What kind of name for a game is that?"

This is the game that kicked off my board game renaissance, and is one I keep going back to.  Even those who aren't generally interested in board games will sit down for an hour or two to play a good game of Catan.  Even after several dozen games, I'm still not bored with the mechanics and gameplay, and can't see it happening in the near future.  Highest recommendation, for both board game enthusiasts who haven't yet played this classic, and are looking for a mildly complicated game to play with non-gamers, or for those just getting interested in gaming and are looking for a good entry-level game.

Sorry, hard-core gamers.  I continue to like this game a lot & I am not tired of it.  If I could find more interested players I would purchase all the variants.  

The luck of the dice certainly dominates the game.  I recently went 12 rounds without getting any resources or if I did, my opponents stole my lonely resource before I could use it.  So I had nothing to trade, nothing to use.  After that experience, I lowered the rating on the game.  I prefer games with less dependency on the dice rolls.

Having the longest road helps VP's but I have noticed I win more often if I concentrate on upgrading settlements to cities as quickly as possible, especially surrounding one product numbered a 6 or 8, and connecting to a port that gives an exchange advantage.  I buy cards when I fail to have enough to upgrade settlements (otherwise my products always get stolen)--potentially 9 products & 3 turns might get you the largest army whereas it takes a minimum of 10 products & 5 turns to maybe get the longest road.

I've been playing [thing=84431][/thing] for the iPad, and as much fun as it is, I've come to realize that a big part of doing well in Catan is choosing the right starting location. If you choose poorly, you're in for a long night. That's kind of frustrating. Still, every face-to-face game of Catan I've played has been a lot of fun. If I got to play more often, I could see it being one of my favorites.

That said, a big part of my fascination with Catan is due to the various "print-and-play" expansions in the File section and elsewhere online.  My wife is into arts and crafts, and it's cool to have found a place where her hobbies intersect. For the base game, we've done the [thing=42147]Harbormaster,[/thing] the [filepage=6452]Jungle[/filepage] and the [filepage=6453]Volcano.[/filepage] See my entry for [thing=325]Seafarers[/thing] for more. Naturally, I have yet to play any of these variants.

I really want to own [thing=926]Cities & Knights,[/thing] but we hardly ever play Settlers as it is, so I can't really justify it. I'm on the fence about [thing=27760]Traders & Barbarians[/thing] for the same reason, especially since we effectively own half of it.

I read an article about this game before playing it: straightforward rules, short games, strategic depth, replayability - the Eurogame genre of board games sounded fascinating. Having been raised on Monopoly and Risk (Why the heck do they still make them? And with in many editions?) this was a breath of fresh air from the outside.

I still do enjoy this game, but I prefer others that are deeper, have a theme I like more, are quicker (for in-between plays), or ones that I haven't tried yet.

RATING: 10
At first I wasn't too impressed with this game- I came into the hobby late and it did not stand above the more recent games that I played alongside it.  The look of the geometric board and the graphics never really excited me.  After about 10 plays tho, I'm really happy with it and it's becoming a simple, easygoing favorite.  I'm won over by it's gameplay.  I think the randomness of the dice help keep the game fresh.  I like it best with three players so there's more room to expand.  It's a family favorite as well.

Note: After many plays I think this game is a bit long.  It can drag early on.

Update:  After playing so many other games, I've come back to Settlers with a lot of respect.  I think if I could only have one Euro it would be this one.  It's such a cool little system, and it's a game group recruiting tool as well.  Normal folks, like family and non- gamers, enjoy and request it.  I love the die rolls for resources and the modular board.  It's got expansion, developing an economy, and risk management.   I like the way the pace quickens as people start producing more goods.  I wish I could play Settlers and  all its variations more often.  Sadly, most gamers I know feel it's old hat by now- but I still sneak in plenty of family games!  Like ASL, Settlers is all about working the bell curve on 2D6.

At first the trading aspect is fun, but after a short time unless you're playing with experienced players, the trading part basically becomes a game of go fish.  And you want it to be a game of go fish because if it's not, the added time of negotiation will make poking your eyes out with the robber by the end seem a better alternative. The initial setup and race to good spots is interesting but short lived.  Then comes an interminable 1.5-2 hours I can only liken to the last half of  The Return of the King where Sam and Frodo spend an equivalent amount of time flopping around on the side of Mount Doom.

I don't hate Settlers, but I could live without it. The thing that kills it for me is the fact that a player can be stuck with nothing to do turn after turn and there's nothing they can do about it. I don't mind luck in games, but when it reduces a player to a spectator, then I'd rather play something else.

The thing that I think bothers me even more than that is the playing time. I could live with the luck if this was a 45 minute game. In fact, if this was a 45 minute game I'd probably love it.

RATING: 3
[Dice rolling, Resource Management, Building, Trading] [3P:3, 4P:3] A question: how is this better than Monopoly? The random resources are the worst aspect of the game. It's got the same basic problem as any game that uses a random mechanism to bestow resources - if luck is against you, you don't get anything. Zilch. Zip. There's no workaround. There are no alternative paths to victory. You NEED your numbers to be rolled. Yes, it will statistically even out, over several *games*, not the same game. Since Settlers takes up to two hours (or even more, aka "The Settlers Game from Hell" which I've been stuck in), that just doesn't cut it. In addition, the theme is remarkably uninspiring. Why are the resources random? We don't know. Somehow the sheep in this game don't grow wool on a regular basis. The trading is boring, consisting of people asking for the same things over and over - if brick is never rolled, *no one has it*. Gah. I don't see how this hooked so many people. This is "The New Monopoly". Avoid.

Now that I've tried Cities & Knights, I am less in love with the base game. But it is a classic with good reason. There is a lot of race tension, can go really quick, and more interaction than most other games we play. Yeah, it seems light compared to lots of other games, but to me, it really has a great balance of *fun* and competition. The only real problem gamers have with this game is that it's been overplayed. And so many gamers are allergic to dice. 

Still, I continue to be amazed at how much non-gamers love this and are willing to play this above any other Euro. Simple as this game may ultimately be, it sure captures the essence of gaming in a non-threatening way.

I love this game.  The production of resource mechanic means it's very difficult for players to be cut out entirely even if others refuse to trade, and in all the games I've played there's never been a serious dispute.  The variety of contributing elements to a win, the modular design for freshness...for me, it's perfect.  I look forward to someday getting the expansion and trying out 5 or 6 players. (9) 2011-04-08

UPDATE - I've played the 5-6 player expansion and like it.  Each player having the option to build at the end of each turn means your plans haven't been lost by the time it takes to go round the table, but in merry circumstances it does help to have someone 'chair' each round.  'Any building? Any other business? No?' (still a 9) 2016-12-08

I am definitely in the camp that says this is one of the all-time great games. I will never "out-grow" this game. Even when it has hit the table a little too often, and I want a break from it, I still get into this game. We have had so many extremely close games that I am sure I will always play it. The only reason it isn't a "10" is that I can get a little burned-out sometimes. It doesn't last long, though. This is probably my favorite gateway, though TTR is my go-to.

Do NOT play a two-player variant.  It is horrible that way.

Catan is a classic which can be recommended for both newbies and veterans. It's nicely expandable too and translated in many languages.

+ Nice combination of dice rolling, card drawing, building and trade.
+ Lots of interaction between players.
+ Relies heavily on luck, which keeps things fresh and gives newbies a chance...
- ...but can also be frustrating and prevent all strategic gameplay.
- Gets pretty crowded even with four players.

Review based on several plays.

RATING: 8
Excellent game, but remember that cities mean that you get *twice* the resource cards for the hexes they're adjacent to, not *one* per city -- and one resource per settlement and two per city that border on that resource.  Sometimes building in a port area can be helpful.  I like the newer (if more cheaply made) version of this game.  More fun to play if you use the "Cities and Knights" expansion.

A good introduction to eurogames (it's what introduced me to eurogames).  It's lots of fun, but usually one person at each game gets frustrated from some bad luck early in the game that made it difficult and impossible for them to win.  It's a great game as a starting off point, but I rarely pull this game out now unless someone else really wants to play it.

This was my, like many others, introduction to German board games.  We played this week in week out for 6 years between 1997-2003.  Up to that point I had no idea about the existance of similar games.
The flexibility in being able to mix several expansions and create your own worlds is fantastic.  The only negative is that in a 3/4 player game there is always one player far behind the others, and their game is over relatively quickly.

In the beginning I thought this game would be more about the luck of the dice then strategy, but after my 1st game I have found that it is how you utilize the dice rolls to win the game. People who say this is all about rolling the dice and taking resources are not seeing the complete and total genius of this game. I have been gaming for over 20 years and this is a "must have" for every strategic gamer.

If you have to play this, you'd need to find a way to distribute tile/number placement evenly. Starting placements are important and I find that in 4 player games, 1 would lose out a lot. Should play OK with 3. But I find that beyond the initial placement and trading, game gets stale fast as people wait around waiting for their numbers to be rolled. Anti-climatic game end.

A true classic. This game is THE gateway game that I use to introduce people to "real" boardgames. This game has spead like wildfire through my circle of friends and it's actually humorous to find out the people who now play Settlers because I introduced a friend to Settlers, who introduced another friend to Settlers, who introduced another friend to Settlers, etc.
For all that I've played it, I still enjoy the experience - though I'd often rather play something else. Not because Settlers is bad, but because I've played Settlers about twice as much as my other games combined.

Esse jogo é uma excelente maneira de introduzir novos jogadores brasileiros ao mundo do jogos modernos. Ele é rápido, cada partida dura em média 50 minutos. As regras são fáceis de explicar (10 minutos). A jogabilidade é fantástica pois permite uma série de possibilidades e o peso dos dados (sorte) é pequeno em comparação aos jogos tradicionais do Brasil. Na realidade a sorte no CATAN "é para todos" já que o valor dos dados pode prejudicar ou beneficiar vários jogadores ao mesmo tempo. Outro fator importantíssimo é que todos os jogadores sempre crescem, uns mais que outros, mas sempre crescem. O tabuleiro formado de peças hexagonais, fato novo para o brasileiro, o que gera sempre um jogo diferente do outro devido a disponibilidade e organização dos recursos. Recomendo.

Still the best Game to convert non-gamers to a better life. If someone wants to start a boardgame collection, this is the first buy I recommend. Also, the game I have played the most. Just because of that, I am presently a bit saturated of it, but it is a superb game! Its strongest points are: - the initial placing of settlements so damn important!- the negotiation skills that the game develops- the robber that is both so fun and annoying depending on the perspective- the race for the longest road and longest army- the fight for territory expansion

It is more here for legacy reasons. The biggest flaw is that it involves other people who can trade, and people are usually bad at trading (overvaluing their own resources, not knowing that the value of a resource is higher if it is your turn, etc.).

I can only think of 3 games I've played hundreds of times and this is one of them. It has relatively simple rules and a randomness associated with setup and resource production which leads some people to believe that this game is more luck than skill. They are wrong. A combination of strategy , trading, and diplomacy can overcome bad initial setups and bad rolls of the dice.

The only thing that stops very experienced players from winning the vast majority of games against less experienced players is that the less experienced players learn after a few games that their only chance is to gang up on the more experienced/skilled player if it looks like they're in the lead. And that leads to more experienced players adopting strategies that make it appear as if they're behind in the first half of the game even though they're setting themselves up for a sprint at the end . . .

One thing I particularly love about this game are the slow-the-leader mechanisms (robber, trading embargoes, development cards) that makes it possible for people to come back from behind and win, which keeps everyone engaged, and makes this game fun to play even when player age and/or skill level is a wide range.

This game has grown boring in my book. 
Too much luck dependant to my taste.
I only see myself playing this again if using a variant to mitigate the luck of the dice roll (e.g. Giving players a token each time a roll gives nothing to them, so later they might chance 10 of said tokens for any one resource). Otherwise, this game would be broken in my opinion. 

Definitely I won't play this again using  the official rules.

Just the base game doesn't have enough to it to hold my attention squarely anymore. I'll teach it if somebody really wants to learn it, but I tend to hang out with board game crowds where everyone either already knows it or already knows it's a little too random and pre-determined for them. I like to play with the traditional randomized board setup on a single, hexagonal island, with the dice chits in alphabetical order. I say this because there are lots of variants, even on the base game. I've also played the Cities & Knights expansion, and while that's more interesting, it's also too long without adding enough depth. I think I've never played the 5-6 player version, even though I think the off-turn building rule change sounds pretty fun.

Ok, lots of gamers have moved on from here and it tends to get a lot of flak.  However...this is still THE gateway game for many people, and it still sells by the bucketload.  It's fun, accessible, and there's nothing else out there that gives the same feeling.

Yes, it can sometimes be unbalanced and a bit random, but good play can mitigate all of that.  4P is the most balanced; 3P can suffer from runaway leader, and the 5-6P expansion is a bad implementation.

I've played literally hundreds of times, and will still come back for more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I dislike that half of the game is determined by luck and the other by direct trade. I have no problem with either generally but in this game the experience is always bad for me. I admit it is a nice, clean design though. It's a good game I can't stand to play

"Vanilla" Settlers is kind of boring.

Back in the day I enjoyed Settlers a lot. Nowadays, though, the luck of the dice mostly keeps me away. For a game where a bad streak for the resource rolls can pretty much eliminate you it's just too long.

Great gateway game to euro games after someone has played Ticket to Ride.

RATING: 5
Negotiation between players is the strong point of the game. Bad dice rolls in the start of the game ruins your victory options. I can't understand the great success of this one. I prefer Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne to appeal newbies instead, they're meatier games.

Funny mainly for people new to the hobby, but not for me.

This game is super fun until you role a '7' 6 times in a row between four players and you are the one who rolled it the 6th time. Similar to monopoly in my opinion, but is better because you can actually end it and people actually want to trade.

This is where it all started for me. After years of only playing games based upon luck (Monoply, Game of Life, Risk etc) I discovered Settlers of Catan; a game where your choices actually have an influence on the outcome of the game.

If had this game in my possession for about 12 years now, and we still play it regularly (althought most of the times with expensions).

Upsides of the game
- not very difficult to explain so you can play it with almost everyone;
- trading your commodities.

Why don't I rate the game with an eight? There is still to much luck involved in the Settles of Catan. And once you've played the game with one or more expansions the base-game gets a bit dull.

RATING: 4
A great family game, beginner game, or game for people who don't want to think too hard. Players get that good building-something feeling. Trading is fun too. Over the years, the role dice play in the game has gotten tiresome. This used to be an 8 for me. 

A good test of character is to see how upset someone gets when they have to lose their cards to the robber, when someone places the robber on one of their tiles, or when its their turn to place the robber :) Each of these challenges can reveal something unique about the players.

Still fun, and very accessible. However, my biggest complaint with it is that it is too difficult to change strategies mid-game. Often, I have the most success when I simply stick with one strategy, so there's not much in the way of tactics. Also, wheat is by far the most important resource, so that imbalance makes things a little less fun as well.

RATING: 7
Good game for an active and talkative group. Some strategy mixed with a healthy dose of luck, but usually not so much that it seems based on it. The dice rolls typically pan out near averages over the course of a game due to the number of rolls. 

Not a lot of depth and once you have played this game a few times it will get stale as an experience. It is a very strong "gateway" game, but for people who are familiar with board games and mechanics, it will not be a very strong overall experience.

This game is definitely family friendly as well, but due to the complexity of the rules and of negotiation, it's not recommended for young children (10 and up are fine, 8-10 if they are advanced intellectually). 

Games don't take too long either, although they can drag if negotiations are too frequent. 

Overall, a 7, with the main faults being the level of luck and the fact that you really need an active group of players to have fun, since trading is such an integral part of the game.

====

Catan is my family's favorite board game. As a gift to my oldest son a couple of years ago, Catan stands as possibly the best bang for our buck game purchase... well... ever. Whenever we have 2 hours to spare (rare these days) we break out this staple and rock and roll. Recently my family has taken to colluding against me (3 on 1) from the start. This doesn't bother me one bit as it adds a real edge to the game for me and presents quite a challenge to my wining prospects. I tend to not be a fan of explicit negotiation in games, but when it works it's exquisite.

[2014.03.01]
I like its general appeal and the ability to get in a quality game with people who wouldn't otherwise play games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
I admit it,its a game with dices so luck plays a major part in the outcome BUT since its the first "development" game I have ever played and since dices love when its about Catan I always want to play it and have great time! One extra good think is that can be played with anybody
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Gateway.  Played to death for a time.  Now that I have played many other games I realize Catan is too luck driven, and the setup time is just ridiculous.  If I want the pretty variable board I will play Tobago, if I want the trading I will play Bohnanza or Chinatown.

Great family game. Plenty of room for a variety of strategies.
My copy has a board which is made from heavy card, which does not lay flat, especially the six surrounding pieces.
Some of the colours are not easy to distinguish, especially the red/orange pieces and the desert tile looks very similar to the grain tiles, although this is not an issue normally as this tile does not have a number on it.

This was an immediate hit with my wife.  I enjoy playing but do not enjoyed getting ganged up on at the end of a four player match if I am in the lead.

Since my regular gaming buddies are guaranteed to be stricken by Analysis Paralysis, it was during a particularly agonizing session that I developed the "secondary game" technique whereby I play an entire other game while they contemplate their turn.  Sometimes we get in a Foosball game to 5.

The modular map is really nice. It and the variety of uses (and non-uses) for different materials allow for divergent strategies.
The way the game seems to tend towards trading with the board rather than other players is frustrating, since that player interaction is pretty neat. Trading gets frustrating in some groups of players, though.

Fabulous game that probably cemented my interest in Eurogames.  Probably more luck than you think, but a really nice game.    "We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time". T S. Eliot.  This quote reminds me of Settlers.  You buy it as a gateway game, go mad buying so many other games that you take it a bit for granted, but when you come back to Settlers after a break, you are reminded again that is it simply a brilliant piece of boardgaming (18/12/08 - Rating 9). UPDATE: Push to ten in that it is the cornerstone game for me (5/4/10 - Rating 10). UPDATE: This is still a very enjoyable game (and still a 10) (24/11/12). UPDATE: My new rating system is to 3 decimal places, so that when I eventually rate every game, I can do a top 100.  This is still a brilliant game, which for me is still an enjoyable experience.  So, the 3 decimal places, I rate is a 9.728 (Dec 2015). UPDATE: Maybe familiarity does breed contempt for my views now on Catan?  I still really like the game / series, but there are now for me better board gaming experiences I would rather go to.  Still rightly a classic, but I think I have reach a point where nothing is left to surprise or further delight me with this game (Rating 8.741, Feb 17).

My wife had never played this one before, so we got a copy and we've been playing this classic a couple of times. I still enjoy it every time I play. Sure, there are probably a bunch of better games out there nowadays, that doesn't stop me from liking this classic.

It's been 10 years since I played my first game of Catan. It is still an all-time classic for me.  I know that with it being more than 20 years old now that it definitely feels dated among all the other games that have come out.  A lot has happened since my first game of Catan.  But it still and always will have an honoured place in my heart. Once you accept the parameters and that this is a fortune-of-luck game, then it's all fine. I forever will love the aesthetic and I still enjoy the nostalgia. So there we go. My first crush I don't mind revisiting from time to time (especially with Seafarers or C&K as part of it).

Legacy comment (from 2008): What a fantastic game!  I had to buy it after playing it for the first time -- making this the second game I have ever bought new (1st was "Khet").  The trading really makes this game engaging across the table.

Catan, by itself, leaves the game up to the dice and not up to the player. If the game included Cities & Knights as being the base, then it would play better and score much higher.

We never play this without the Seafarers and Cities & Knights expansions.  We also use the event deck rather than the original dice... my eldest son hurled the dice into our wood-burning furnace in a fit of pique after an evening during which 10 became the new 6.

I found the game simply over stayed its welcome by going on too long for what it was. The inter-player trading aspect only served to exacerbate that. If you don't get a good start by getting a good position on the map, prepare to endure a long game with frustratingly little you can do about it.

Settlers is good because you can generally achieve something, and you usually feel like you're making progress. However there are periods of depression where the thief is on you or the dice aren't going your way that make you feel like you'll never get out of the quagmire you're in. It gets a slightly lower than deserved score from me because of the depression factor.

Omigosh!  One of the most stellar games ever.  Players develop towns and cities on a map of hexagons producing resources, depending on dice-rolls.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable introductory "German style" game. Within this genre of game, it is easy to learn, and the play moves along quickly with very limited pauses for strategizing. There is a bit of what I call a "Risk factor" in this game, namely that it often becomes clear who is going to win while there is still a fair amount of time left in the game. It is always annoying when you have to spend 20 minutes or more playing out a game that you know you've lost.

The game that opened mine, and alot of others' eyes to a world beyond monopoly.  A classic.  I find I never tire of playing, and I don't mind the dependability on probability.  Not a deep. or heavy game in any sense, but it's hard to say if there are many better light, or gateway games.

UPDATE:  Although Settlers is a true classic, that would find it near impossible to ever leave my collection, I have to sadly say my rating has fallen to 7.  I still believe Settlers can offer a wonderful gateway experience, but with Elasund taking charge in the house of Catan, it rarely finds table time.  This great Teuber game I will always have a debt to for opening my eyes, but now, with the apple biten I no longer find paradise in this garden.

Newbies who think they've graduated to "real" board games love to denigrate this game for some reason, but it's really pretty unique if you look at it in the context of most other euros. It can drag a little, but overall I think this game still holds up and is fun to play.

RATING: 8.5
Not your usual board game (Sorry, Clue, Monopoly) in that you don't have a token that you move around a board the number of spaces rolled on the dice. The "board" in this game is made up of hexagon tiles of 5 different resources that are randomly placed in a honeycomb and randomly assigned a number between 2 and 12. The ability to change the layout of the board allows for countless replay-ability. A great game for people looking to branch out from the standard board games, but I imagine it would be a little overwhelming to grasp the rules by simply reading the rule book included, it would be best to find someone with experience to teach you the game.

Catan is not a bad game. But, there is also nothing here that makes me want to go back to it now. It feels like another game that requires players of close skill level to be enjoyable. Early starting placements and opening moves can lock a player out of the game. Not enough fun for the amount of time it takes to play and so many other better games in my collection.

Fun, and really good to play with the right group of people. Unfortunately it bothers me how much it's based on luck. It really gets frustrating when there's nothing you can do in the game for no other reason than the numbers you chose never get rolled. The biggest thing that hurts Settlers is that every game starts to feel the same after a while.

The first time someone introduced me to this game, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only other modern board games I had played up to that point were Betrayal and RoboRally.

I have only logged 3 plays of Settlers, but I have played it so many more times.  It really gave me another push to pursue other games, and now, here I am. It has definitely cemented its place in gaming history and my personal history as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's hard to score this game as although its gameplay value is beyond dispute, the level of inherent randomness is way too high for most players. As a result, once every player is in possession of the fundamental skills needed to play, the winner is pretty much decided by the roll of the dice. Try substituting cards for the dice to cut down on the luck factor.

On the other hand, this game is just so much plain old fun that it is hard for me (and everyone else) to keep from playing from time to time. Just don't take it too seriously. This game is never followed by sessions of analyzing who did what wrong or right, if you know what I mean. Real solid games are almost always followed up by such discussions in our group. This is not such a game.

Overall, I like Settlers of Catan - the mechanics and gameplay are overall smooth while there are plenty of decisions to make. Where I take issue, however, is with the complete lack of ability to affect the dice rolls...I've played games where the dice rolls are overall pretty even, allowing for constant forward momentum, but I've also played others where a player (feels like always me, but that's probably just confirmation bias) rolls nothing of use for several turns in a row, effectively cutting them off at the knees. There are so many expansions to this game that it's probably been sorted somewhere along the way, but there are just other games that I would rather play instead.

The old, venerable "got wood for sheep?" classic.  Probably the best known game in my collection among my friends, most of whom are not gamers.  The good is that Settlers is extremely easy to explain: roll, trade, build, next player.  Play is as fast as people can seal trade deals, and there is a good deal of player interaction.  The bad is that the game is just a little too long these days has been eclipsed by newer designs.

Settlers of Catan has great game mechanics and is easy enough to learn that it makes a great gateway game for non-gamers. My favorite aspect of board games is the player interaction and the opportunity to trade resources and make deals encourages this as well as helping keeps a balance of power throughout the session.

RATING: 7.5
In my opinion, Settlers of Catan is quickly becoming one of 'the' new classics of the modern gaming age.  This is a perfect gateway game for those that lived on Monopoly and Life and want to take their board game experience to a new level.  That being said, you can only play this game so many dozens of times before it gets old.  Luckily, Mayfair Games gave us expansions.  To remove some of the luck aspect, I highly recommend this rule from the expansions: whenever a production roll results in a player receiving no resources (except on a "7"), that player receives 1 gold.  2 gold can be traded for one resource of the player's choice during their turn.

I used to love this game.  Now I dread playing it. But it deserves a spot on my shelf and I have many friends who clamor fo it.  I have noticed that many non-gamers really enjoy this one, I think because the absolutely neutral theme makes everything seem very upfront and understandable.  The lack of theme is what kills it for me (also the hate-trading)

Played this one with a couple of expansions. I'm not sure whether this would be that interesting without expansions. It's rather enjoyable game, you do really need to strategize pretty well. A downside is that it can be pretty brutal, especially if you don't have a good numbers and this can really suck. As well, with more players, it can take quite long to wait for your turn.

This is an excellent game to bring casual game players into the universe of European-style strategy and resource games. I've hooked any number of people on Catan after just a couple of plays.

The game also lends itself to a moderate amount of customization. People create their own house rules easily, dramatically changing the strategy. The expansions and ability to create random or custom maps also adds to its re-playability.

Catan's greatest weakness is in the, often, random distribution of land tiles and number markers. Poor distribution can lead to long, tedious games or severely unbalanced gameplay. A little less random distribution tend to even this out.

I'm very torn on this game. I played it after being introduced to more modern designer games, so the flaws with Catan were very apparent. In board games and video games, I hate having my ability to act removed from me. 

Between bad dice rolls and relying on players to trade goods, I can wait 10 minutes to take my turn only to roll the dice and pass. I don't like the excitement of taking my turn turning in to disappointment when no one will trade me a sheep for 2 of my wheat, or just having the dice (once again) fail to roll my areas. 

At the same time, having an "average" game is pretty enjoyable. And I think my wife put it best when she said that the game is most fun when everyone is relaxed and willing to trade, rather than being cutthroat and always denying one another.

[Original comment] This is currently the favorite game in our family (April 2005). It has most of the features we enjoy about gaming. There is a lot of interaction and negotiation with other players; the gameboard is different every time; there are enough important factors to consider that no single strategy will win every time; there is just enough randomness to make it interesting (and sometimes frustrating); the rules are not complicated; the game time is just right (we can now play a 5-player game in about an hour); and players have a number of options almost every turn, to require some decision-making. It's an excellent family game.

Update February 2006 -- We usually play with 6 players now, and it is still a family favorite.

(December 2006) And now, we're playing with 7 players, and it's still a favorite, although we've had to modify some rules to play with that many.

May 2009 -- This is still a family favorite, and we play it often.

October 2011 -- This long-time family favorite continues to be at or near the top of our selection lists for game days. We always play with at least 5 players, which makes for a crowded map. The negotiations, blocking, the moans over the dice rolls, and the surprises (like stealing the Longest Road to win the game) keep it high on our list of favorites. I doubt we will ever tire of this game, which is about as high a compliment as can be made.

November 2012 -- We may play this game forever. Our daughter and son-in-law purchased the fancy version with wood tiles, which makes the game much more attractive. It continues to be a family favorite.

2013-November:  We haven't changed our minds about this game -- it's still a family favorite.

A classic!  Spent many sleepless nights at Denny's with friends over this game.  Played it since the first Mayfair English version came out.  I'm glad to see that it is finally catching on to the mainstream gaming community!  Bit too much luck is involved with the dice rolls at times, but the game is well balanced over time.  Loved by my guy friends and gal friends, gamers and non-gamers alike.  Scoring is simple, and almost every game everyone gets the feeling that they are somewhat close to winning.  Perhaps not the best game ever made in the modern time, but definitely the first of the best that opened the door for many more to come -- for that, it deserves a 10!

Finally, after hearing about it for many years, I got to play it recently and can't get enough. I quickly ramped up from being a beatable newbie to worthy opponent after picking up the strategies and tactics after one game. Lives up to billing as "Game of the Century".

One of the VERY few games I like to play over the Internet more than in person.  Great game, but it's not so hard to get into a "no-win" situation, which makes that particular game not so fun. People who try to "beat dead horses" while trading can also slow things up.

I like this game, but it hasn't been very satisfying a decent percentage of the times I've played face to face.

I adored this game for years. Completely addicted and brought it everywhere and got so many people hooked on it.  This was my gateway game to Euros in 1995. For years this was all I played, and I didn't know there were other games like it.  Now I look at it with nostalgia, but I no longer have the same passion to play it.

It's still a very good game and the modularity of the board makes the experience nicely varied. I don't really believe all the "it's too luck-dependent" -claims. Yes, there are dices and sometimes they can screw you really badly, but most of the time clever trading and building will make up for the dicerolls.

Granted, I've only played this against bots online. Perhaps the frustration of constantly crapping out on the dice is amusing in real life with human opponents, but my guess is that the slower playtime would only heighten and prolong the agony. So, while I occasionally give it yet another shot against the bots, I doubt I'll ever be willing to take this face to face. 

Update: A 6 player face to face session now under my belt, I feel confident saying that no, crapping out on the dice is not amusing in real life with human opponents. I never want to settle in Catan again.

Ok gateway game but this is like monopoly so more about luck than decisions - the winner will inevitably be the player who got the luck of the resource rolls and early bad luck means you will never be competitive.

Dunno what to say about Settlers that hasn't been said.  It's pretty easy to pick up but meatier and more interesting than, say, Carcassonne for me (if not as interesting to look at on the table...).  I enjoy playing Settlers quite a bit and it still got one of the most positive receptions among my lighter euro group friends I've played with.  I think, as some of the ATers have pointed out in the past, the attractive thing about the game is that it's a design that crosses a lot of boundaries.  There is trading and building with victory points but it also has a number of screwage elements like the robber and has some randomness in the design.  This is definitely a crossover in almost all sense of the word.

What's extraordinary, I made (with a little help of my wife) a home version of this game. Without any printing or photocoping. Just various kinds of paper, scissor, glue, crayons, felt-tip pens. Yes, I was desperate that time. Some things happen once in a lifetime :-). What can be irritating in the game are the dice (randomness). On the other hand the trade aspect is great. It's a good gateway game (not so family anyway) and I can play it from time to time.

RATING: 9
I don't think there's anything I could say about Catan that hasn't already be said - one of my favorite games! I have to rate it a 9, however, due to the quality of the boards - they warp far too much in even mildly humid climates. Still, it's hard to beat a good game of Catan among (soon-to-be-ex-) friends!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A classic.  Great for introducing people to boardgames.  Nice balance of luck and strategy ... I win because of my strategy and I lose because of bad luck!

However, mostly burned out on this from overplaying it.

RATING: 6
It takes way too long to play for what's going on. It's useful to gauge people's awareness of boardgaming, or as a sign-post for board gaming. Oh, you've heard of settlers? Cool.

+ Seafarers, and Traders and Barbarians
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Depending on the die rolls it can easily happen that you are not able to do anything for rounds. This problem is increased by the values of ore, wheat and sheep that are less useful goods. Thus, I prefer the Cities and Kinghts expansion to the basic game that upgrades the values of these goods and adds new possible winning strategies.

Played inclusive the expansions "Seafarers" and "Citys and Knights". It's good with kids or persons who didn't play often board game.

Quite possibly the best gateway into the boardgame hobby ever.  Random island layouts (using the island setup rules that come with the game) keep each game fresh and new.

Fun Family game.  Only play for fun.  3 people game can be stupid if they wont trade. Also, the robber early on can be too devasting and make the game boring.  Too much based on luck and diplomacy.

The Settlers of Catan
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Early bad placement or bad dice luck can slog this game.  I also don't like the open bartering system.  Prefer real rules, not favoritism.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like many, Settlers was our first foray into board-gaming and to this day it's still a gem to play. The game's biggest draw for us is the player interaction - players gain resources out of turn if their numbers come up. Combine this with lots of resource trading and Settlers is a load of fun with little downtime.

I haven't played this game in years (we almost exclusively play 2P now). I'd have to revisit to see how it holds up.

RATING: 7
I secretly only keep this around for those times when I'm with my family and we feel like playing a game.  A lot of my other games tend to have themes that my relatively religiously conservative family would lend to being 'demonic' or morbid.  This is cute and fluffy for the most part and I think the player interactivity really helps it.

Considering trading it and the expansions I have. Need some fresh meat!

Preferably sheep.

Catan.

RATING: 8
The very first new generation's boardgame I was introduced to. Catan box is maybe the most worn-out gamebox in my library, which is the maybe best evidence of game's greatness. Sometimes dices can become your worst enemy, which IS frustrating. But at the same time they have an important role in making game very reachable for players of all levels. Extra points for the simplicity of design work.

A family favorite for many years - our most played 6-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not sure when I acquired this - probably around 2009/10. When I was getting back into gaming I felt this was a must-buy, and indeed it was popular with my group for a while (especially with Seafarers).

These days we tend to leave out Seafarers and go back to vanilla Catan, and since we now tend to play so many shorter games this feels like it runs a little long. Also, I find it annoying when certain opponents that shall not be named are obnoxious with their trading.

Kept in my collection more for nostalgia value these days I guess, although it might see a revival one day.

...nope, sold in July 2017.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
People get down on this game now, but it's still super fun I think.  It's the game I can get non-gamers to play and they feel like they are stepping into my world a bit.

It obviously sucks to have the robber on your spot the whole game, which pretty much always happens to me, but it's a great game, and I don't mind the politicking.  

I haven't played any of the other versions of this game, so I can't speak to them really - just the 4-6 player regular.

Eurogame classic, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone here [The Netherlands] who hasn't played it - at least in my experience.

I enjoy playing Catan, it's not as deep or strategical as I'd like, and it can drag on towards the end, but close matches can be fun. Rolling a seven right before you were going to spend all your 9 cards to settle at some killer spot leads to great fun (and annoyance) as well.

*Need to put on the marketplace.

Settlers is a great game that is fun and variable without being too rules heavy. It's a game that travels well, and easy to set up for quick play if you have limited time. It takes longer while teaching new players, but experienced players can pop a game out in 30 minutes. Good game!

Fantastic game. Perfect to introduce people to "euro" games. The random board makes each game unique, there are various strategies to game play, and solid player interaction. Also the use of dice adds just the right amount of luck to the game. Everyone who I've introduced this to loves it, the only reason it isn't a "10" is because I prefer deeper economic games, but this is a very solid game (1 year ago it would have been a 10 for me).

I actively avoid this game.  Too repetitive, too few decisions, too much annoying futzing around with the resource cards, great potential for a randomly-selected runaway loser.

House rules: We re-roll 7's the first two turns around.

The original is still very good at what it does. This is the board game that you introduce to someone who thinks Monopoly and Clue are the sum total of what board games represent. Sit this one down in front of them, get them to try it out a few times, and then slowly introduce them to actual GAMES! 
I mean, there's a renaissance out there people!

There are games on the market that create experiences you could only have if you had an actual working TARDIS: WWII battles, pursuing Jack the Ripper down a twisted branching alleyway, or defending King Arthur from a betraying errant knight.
I marvel at the current artistry of the Golden Age of game design. We truly live in interesting times.

You know what? Don't play this game with people who've only ever played YHATZEE and BUNKO. Screw 'em!  If they've limited their experience of game mechanics to the intricacies of Chutes and Ladders, then this game is too good for 'em! They're in the Dark ages (which is a great expansion for Dominion, by the way).
Let those people go. You can't save them. They're weighing you down. Cut the rope. 
Move on.

A classic game that requieres no explanation. The mechanics are simple enough to teach it to everybody. Its a joy to play it. I love that it has player interaction that leads to good laughs with the right players. The art does it purpose. You can play it a lot and it doesn't get old. You have to plan your towns very well or you'll be losing from the first turn. Add Catan to your collection, you won't regret it.

I don't get the fascination people have with this game.

Luck is a deciding factor in this game, it features lengthy periods of down time (when all you do is roll the dice because you have no resources, and that roll is more likely to help others than you), and has king-making issues.

Basically, if you like "strategy" games like Monopoly, you should love this one. Otherwise, I don't get how anyone likes it.

Game that introduced me to gaming. Of course I will always love it for that. But then again, I will never hate dice more than I hate them as a result of Settlers (five 4's in a row! but I am not on a 4! Fuck.). Also, seems to be an obvious strategy, get on wheat and ore. However, simple and fun. Huge step up from Scrabble and Monopoly.

Moment of Glory: Having a city on the four of ore and four of wheat when the 4 is rolled five times in a row.

RATING: 6
For many players this is the introduction game to the hobby, but not for me as I learn to enjoy euros through other games. That is maybe why I don’t have the same nostalgia associated with this game as many other gamers. The game is fairly straightforward to explain, where the phases are distinct and simple. During the game there is usually not much thinking about how to use your resources, but there is definitely an amount of resource management.

What it comes down to in most game in my experience is two things, die rolling and initial set up. If you get your machine going in the beginning of the game you are hard to stop. The robber is simply not enough to stop and by not trading with him you might lose out on that too. That is also my main complaints about the game; there is too much luck and circumstances. 

I like to play this game with either 3 or 4 players. With 4 players the board is a little tighter, so players can be shut-in, but that is generally in the end game anyway.

Eight plays: twice with no expansions, thrice with Cities & Knights, once with fishermen, one five-player game with both Cities & Knights and Seafarers, once six-player with Seafarers.

Catan is tolerable with just the base game and four players; it's luck-heavy, and your most important decision happens in the first five minutes, but it's over fairly quickly. It's also probably not too bad with four players and just Seafarers. However, when you add on expansions that significantly increase the length and complexity, it just becomes a bore. I think I would even go so far as to say that I actually loathe it in those situations.

What can I say about this game? It started my (and many others) obsession with boardgames, and I still use it as an introductory game for people new to boardgames. At one time I used to love it dearly, but I can hardly stand to play it most of the time now - except of course for showdowns with my boardgame arch-nemesies.

This game made me hate dice, and it took a long while before I was able to reconcile that fact. ;-)

RATING: 7
One of the greatest Euros. It introduced me to a new style of gaming, but like many I haven't returned to it in years. I think the game is too often determined by initial placement of settlements. My interest in the game was re-engaged by the XBox Live version, and now my kids are getting into it. My preferred set is the board and cards of Simply Catan with wooden pieces from an older Mayfair Edition.

RATING: 4.5
I've played this twice now, I won once, and lost once.  Neither time was I able to get into the game much.  The mechanic and trading can keep me interested for the first half hour or so, but eventually the random nature of the dice rolls takes over and kills the fun.   For the next hour or so it becomes a slow slog until someone wins.  Whenever I find myself just wishing someone, ANYONE would hurry up and win, the game is not for me.  I'm willing to give it one more try if forced to, but otherwise I'm done with this.

Para mí Catan es un juego que toda persona debería jugar en algún momento, como que quiebra lo que todos pensarían de un juego de mesa, tiene demasiada interacción con las personas que lo están jugando, lo cual lo hace muy divertido. Es fácil de jugar para divertirse, pero es muy complejo para poder jugarlo de mejor manera, existen muchos tipos de estrategia y uno puede darle muchas vueltas al juego pensando cuál será la mejor colocación para cada uno de los mapas que se puede formar. 
Este juego cuenta con campeonatos nacionales en Chile, por lo que se puede jugar de manera competitiva, entregando una motivación extra a la hora de jugarlo.

This is another game that is great with 6 people (we have the expansion set).  I love the negotiating of resources - I've always liked Monopoly because of this, and the same principles apply in Catan.  The fact that dice rolls can affect who wins the game is not the best game mechanic, because there may be too much chance involved.  But if your placements are evenly spread out among many numbers you can limit this risk - which is a good game strategy.

Great game, but unlike most people I attribute Carcassonne as my gateway that got me into board games instead of Catan. Catan was my second purchase and though we enjoyed it, it hasn't really gotten any plays in a year. The XBOX version is pretty cool though. Could use an expansion to see more play but then I'd rather just expand a game we're already playing!

The Settlers of Catan may well be the single greatest board game ever designed. Like many other German games, it combines simple rules and a short playing time with the potential for intricate strategy and battles of wits. But Catan is arguably the best example of bringing all these elements into perfect balance.

Catan satisfies a wide range of people, even those who normally hate board games, since it is the players themselves that choose the character of each game. It can be as cutthroat or as amiable as you want (or both!). It also excels at keeping every player actively involved at all times, both through the ingenious system of resource production and the constant opportunities for trading and deal-making. I could go on, but others already have.

I have no hesitation in recommending Settlers of Catan to pretty much anyone. From there, you may choose to explore more complex or more simple-structure games, but Catan is good for all!

The game that opened my eyes to the fact that board games can be something truly special. I love the way the board looks, its a lush island with resources everywhere, in fact, I've used the board as a map for roleplaying, it works quite well. Anyway, my only quibbles are that the game can be quite boring if your die rolls never come up. I've played games where I maybe got my number 2 or 3 times. Fortunately, the game doesn't last very long....except for that one three hour 6 player game. That was brutal.

This being a very popular game, often referred to as a gateway game, I had high expectations for my first play. I was a little disappointed, although it is clear this is a good game. The most disappointing element is that this game is essentially Monopoly, as the rich get richer and the poor fade away. When someone isn't producing, they have no opportunity to trade and are essentially out of the game. There's little balancing there, as the only thing such players can hope for is pity. (There's no pity in this sort of game. Altruism is almost never a factor in a game unless no one is actually playing to win.) I imagine the German expansion with the helper cards (somewhat recreated in the Star Trek variant) and/or the cards that replace the dice would be a bit of an improvement, but at that point you almost have a different game. Regardless, I'll be willing to play. There's something absurdly fun about people begging for sheep.

Ezzel kerültem kapcsolatba újra a társasjátékok világával. A maga idejében jól ki volt használva. Akkoriban rendkívül izgalmasnak találtam. A nyersanyagok kockával kidobása viszont egyre jobban idegesített. Nem mintha zavarna, ha egy játékban sok múlik a szerencsén, de bosszantó ha a nyavalyás sorsvetőn ilyen sok múlik. És a többi játékos kínlódását is alig tudom kivárni. És az se tetszik, hogy kialakulhat egy olyan helyzet, hogy még azért is küzdeni kell ,hogy élvezzem a játékot, mert alig maradt lehetőségem a játékban a terjeszkedésre és/vagy a kereskedésre. Szóval most ott pihen a szekrényben, mert minek üljek le olyan játékhoz ami csak felidegesít. Végül a sírját az újdonság utáni vágyam ásta meg.

De ha jobban belegondolok a hetes dobásokkal lett tele a tököm.

A mobilon azért ott van. Hosszabb utazáson még mindig el lehet vele ütni az időt. Az AI nem gondolkozik sokat. :)

Playing with three people seems about right to me: the game takes too long with four, but I'll still play it with the right people. Catan would be better served if trading could happen at any time during the game (the robber would create a musical chairs reaction when the music stops). The slowest part of the game is having to wait for the current player to suggest trades.

I respect what this game offers for nostalgia, but I never grew up with it. Random, simple, too long and boring.

So much is swingy and random and there's very little that can be done strategically to mitigate it.

RATING: 10
A beautifully simple game.  The rules can be taught in a couple of minutes and due to the changing board and dice roles every game is different.  I've played literally hundreds of games and they're always fun.  Yes, sometimes you can have run away winners, and with the huge amounts of luck involved you can have a very poor game without really doing anything wrong, but the game is quick enough to play a few times an evening.  The more you play the more you find ways to mitigate against all the dice roles and maximise your resources, and quite quickly you find the number of games where you think you were unlucky dramatically starts to drop.

The classic German game.  The game is pretty simple compared to most other popular German games, but can still involve quite complex strategies in the form of trades and bluffing.  Trade is an essential part of the game, which means everyone's involved at all times, especially with five or six players.  It does have a fairly significant luck component, but competent players can hedge their bets.  A good choice for people just starting with German games.

Love this game. Very friendly, family game. The only thing is the time to set it up requires some time before the game. But I love the Seafarers edition, as it adds the whole border around to keep everything in place and ships as another option.

I like this game when the dice cooperate, and I hate it when they don't. They usually don't. There's nothing worse than waiting 15 minute before you can do anything because the right numbers didn't come up.

It's so strange that this is the ultimate gateway game. It guess it makes some sense from the perspective of complexity. It's got some interesting mechanics without being hard to learn. But it has such huge flaws. Every game seems to drag about 20 minutes too long. Careful planning can be ruined by unlucky dice rolls. And the difference between winning and losing is actually very subtle. Getting those last two points is crazy tricky for a game that's supposed to be relatively simple.

I think I've played this game at least 50 times, but likely closer to 100 (including Cities & Knights) and I still love playing it.  this is the game that we played as a family for years before it became mine and my brother's obsession which we then shared with many of his and my friends too.  This really is a phenomenal gateway game, and it's still fun for gamers, but the amount of luck is a turn off for a lot of them, I think.  I was thrilled to find this at Value Village for 6.99$ punched, but unplayed and it still had the receipt in the box from the Christmas purchase.  Lucky me!

It's a staple. But there are so many games that feed the same appetite with more flare and nuance. I usually try to steer our play group away from this, but never regret playing.

This is a great game with a high replay value that has only diminished slightly over time for me.

It took only 1 game of my friend's German edition to get me hooked on this.. Not having bought any boardgames for a long time I was fortunate to pick up a copy of the Mayfair edition in a book shop in Manchester shortly after Christmas...

Still a lot of fun to be had after countless games.

Update: And the score is down again... There are other, better games we would rather play.

RATING: 7.5
I've probably played this a hundred times by now and while I'll still play it, it's never going to be my first choice. There's a lot of luck involved, which can be frustrating but also can make for memorable games and really dramatic moments. For a more "even" game, it's easy to swap in a card deck for die rolls but I feel like the game loses some charm this way. Annoyingly, in a game where the ideal choice is usually fairly obvious, there tends to be a lot of analysis paralysis when newer players know they can work out the odds but take a long time to do so. Having a "longest turn" card which subtracts VPs is a great addition when everyone has similar levels of experience with the game.

I finally, and I mean, finally played this game in 2007 after years of hearing about it from several different people over the years, and sure enough, I was hooked. And now, because of Settlers, I'm discovering all of the other great games that have come out in its wake.

But having played several others and checked out many more, I realize just how great Settlers really is.  Such a terrific balance of factors and a lot of interaction, and so many games that are very tense and come down to the wire in that "anyone could win it in their next turn" kind of way that Settlers is famous for.

I won't object to playing it, but seems like a lot of energy is spent for little change of the board. The ending is always a let down. Some new players really have a negative reaction, so I'm not sure it's always a great gateway game. Winner's Circle is more fun with more activity and more of a comeback opportunity for the same time investment.

Still a good game, but these days I have to really want to play it to enjoy it. Got overplayed a huge amount when it first came out and I consider there to be better games available today. Still enjoyable to teach newcomers to the idea of Eurogames though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've been in the gaming scene long enough to know that this title is not the end all be all of gaming.  If anyone were to tell me that this was their favorite board game, I would have to ask them if they had played any other euro games.  I can't but think that anyone who had tried several titles would have to know that the genre has evolved since Catan.

Still, Catan is not completely obsolete.  It occupies a unique position in that it is light years ahead of Parker Brothers in terms of depth, but still accessible enough to be interesting to new players who are not immersed in board gaming.  This makes it valuable as a gateway game.  I still use this to introduce friends to serious board gaming.

The gameplay itself is perhaps better than people give it credit for.  The negotiations for resources are always interesting.

The biggest problem with the game comes down to how much the dice can deny unlucky players a chance to enter the game.  Good placement and smart trading can only take you so far, but I've played numerous games in which for the first several turns only three numbers were rolled.  There are house rules and expansions that help smooth out the distribution of resources, but ultimately a pig-headed group can ruin your game.

That is not an unforgivable feature of a game.  Most games are more fun with better players, but some games just do a better job of making sure the players have to really work to hold their lead.

Ultimately, I think this a title that is well worth owning.  Even though I don't really play it with my regular game group any more, I still enjoy introducing it to new players or taking it for a spin for old time's sake.  Gaming has moved on from Settlers, which may make it seem like it's gotten worse, but it's still as strong of title as it ever was.  If you don't have it, you may not need to buy it, but if you do have it, you probably shouldn't sell it.  You'll eventually be glad you still have it.

It is worth mentioning that Catan now has approximately one million expansions and more seem to come out all the time.  Perhaps they've found a way to reproduce?  At any rate, these expansions do make the game better.  However, I think this is more worthwhile as a means of extending the life of your current copy of the game than as a reason for buying the base game.

Right now, Catan with two expansions costs around $80 ($100 for a six player board).  With three you're looking at $120 ($140 for six players).  I have had fun playing with the expansions, but I don't think the experience was worth that much, especially when Archipelago is only $60 and doesn't need expansions to be awesome.

Played this to death many years before I even got into the hobby. Doesn't get to the table much nowadays though. Always happy to join in on a game however and will even suggest it for nostalgia's sake.

I like a balanced game of Settlers, but unfortunately not every game is balanced. Either I don't receive many resources and can hardly do anything, or I receive plenty of resources and end up feeling guilty towards the other players.

I'm not a huge fan of the 'will you trade your wool for my brick' mechanic. Many times people just don't want to trade with me (it feels like) or I feel like I ended up helping them more than myself.

Showing its age compared to many other games in my collection.  It is however the game that started it all so it rightly deserves a spot on the game shelf.  Many non gamers have heard of it too so its there to tempt them into turning into a gaming geek like me! ;)

4th edition production values are average.  Poor die punching, warped hexes and unsealed/untextured cards let an otherwise pretty game down.

Incluye expansion 5~6 jugadores. Revendido por V.Karku

Los jugadores ya avezados lo encontraran quiza con "poca chicha", pero yo lo considero un buen juego para iniciarse en las mecanicas de los "modernos" juegos de mesa. facil de comprender y apto para todos los publicos. 

En mi opinion destacan las fases de negociacion. esos "oveja por ladrillo?"..."dos ovejas por ladrillo?" son ya un clasico del mundillo. 

Las expansiones le vienen bien para "darle vidilla" y mejorar versatilidad (el original solo admite 3 o 4 jugadores).

de hecho ese es en mi opinion el principal defecto del juego: que se creó inicialmente para 3-4 (y SOLO 3-4) jugadores, luego fue expandido y DESPUES DE ESO fue cuando salió la expansión para adaptarlo a 5-6 jugadores... mas luego las expansiones para adaptar las expansiones existentes a 5-6 jugadores. un desperre y un caos. 

quisieron evitar vender un nuevo juego base con el que las expansiones antiguas no fueran compatibles y en mi opinion fue peor el remedio que la enfermedad. :/

RATING: 4
I don't get it, man. Too much is swayed by what the dice tell you and when. Plus, if you mess up during the two minutes of initial settlement placement, the next forty-five won't mean a thing. The whole enterprise stagnates when a rare resource doesn't enter the game ("Anyone got wheat? Anyone? Still no?), which oddly seems to be intentional.

A Catan-nak köszönhetem, hogy itt vagyok, s hogy mára több mint ötven játék boldogítja a femilit, s a cimbiket. Ez azért meghatározza viszonyom e játékkal.

Módosítottam értékelésem miután láttam néhány pech-sorozattal megtűzdelt játékot, s ez elgondolkoztatott. A Catanba be van építve, hogy peches dobások esetén a játékos tevékenysége a kockadobásban kimerül. Ha szerencséje van, ő a bankos, mert akkor legalább ezzel foglalkozhat.

Still one of the best "gateway" games if you're trying to branch out from Sorry, Monopoly, Clue, or party games.  Over time if you find that you love this game and start playing more Euros, you may find that the luck element in Catan can occasionally make the game miserable for someone playing. The rich get richer if you are left far behind by bad dice rolling, and don't gain any resources, and are then not someone anyone wants to trade with. This chain reaction can lead to someone watching everyone else play Settlers of Catan. 

That said, this was the game that launched me into Eurogames, and I'll always play it with a group of new initiates to the hobby.

Siedler! An excellent game that I dislike. Now, it’s quite easy to coax me into playing, and play will be fun and intense, but to be good at this game you cannot rely on luck and placement alone; you need to enjoy and be good at trading, negotiating, and manipulating your co-players in order to overcome shortages, bad die rolls, and poor odds. Good at this I am not; neither do I enjoy it. Still, a great game.

RATING: 7
Rating based off of first game that I played and taught my 8 year-old twin daughters. They learned it pretty easily, though the game took a while because of one of the girls not keeping her hand in order, especially later when we all started getting more cards. I won with 11 points after I played a Knight to take the Biggest Army card from one of my girls (who ended up with 7 points down from 9 and could have won the next turn otherwise) and my other daughter finished with 9 points. So it was a really close game and we were all in it to the end. Trading went well and they picked up on that quickly and were good sports about it. 

My one complaint so early in my experience with the game is the components, and that was reflecting in my rating. They aren't the greatest. The perimeter puzzle pieces are kind of flimsy and bend easily with humidity. Considering the game came out so long ago, perhaps they just didn't make component's as thick back then? 

My rating will likely go up with more plays. I like the simplicity of it and I love that my kids really like it, so that means it will get more play and that's always part of ratings for me.

One of my favorites. Easy to learn and fun to play. Player interaction is good and the random board feature is just great. I have introduced this game to two different groups and they both love it.

Joc d'iniciació amb atzar (la recol·lecció de recursos ve definida per una tirada de daus, hi han punts directes en les cartes de desenvolupament) i amb negociació (intercanvi de recursos). Senzill d'explicar. Taulell "modular". Hi ha cert puteig en la col·locació del lladre.

Les partides s'assemblen molt entre si. Els jugadors molt competitius ignoren la part de negociar que té el joc, el que el fa encara més depenent de l'atzar. La col·locació inicial és molt important, et pot deixar fora de la partida...

(2007-2008) Un jeu qui a révolutionné les Euro. Mais la faiblesse du jeu pour moi demeure la négociation et la possibilité de se trouver avec des gens qui ne sont pas toujours intéressés à négocier. On se trouve également avec une forte part de hasard avec le lancement des dés pour les ressources et pour le voleur. On demeure également dans un multiplayer solitaire où chacun construit ses propres choses. Ça peut devenir drainant et long. Définitivement pas mon meilleur jeu.

Truly one of the best gateway games ever.  Base game can get old after a few dozen plays and the dice can sometimes be frustrating.  Game can be obnoxious if you get screwed early by the starting placement.  Few games are as dependent on the starting placement as Settlers, which can hinder newbies who try to pick up the game as it goes.  There is a lot more tension, conflict, and interaction than you would expect.  A classic I don't think will be replaced.

This is a best-played-in-groups game that our gamer friends never really want to play and our non-gamer friends have sometimes heard of.

A trading game, which isn't always my cup of tea, but it's good for casual groups.

RATING: 6
I mean, it's a classic, and the game that got me into board games. With that said, it's very rare this one comes out any more. The reliance on dice for everything takes quite a lot of the joy out of it. I could play amazingly well and still be messed about by factors entirely out of my control. I like the randomness of dice when they make me think on my feet and be flexible with strategy. I'm less thrilled when they make me completely uncompetitive. With that said, it's still fun, and does plenty right with the selling aspects, and multiple strategies to victory. The benchmark.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Tough to say anything bad about this one. Easy rules, strategic depth, meaningful choices, beautiful components, just the right length, a gateway for many people to eurogames. I find it really works best with 4 players (or maybe 3), but more than that really changes the dynamics. So much depends on the initial placement that it can be frustrating for someone new, so the recommended setup can ease this. I still love to play it and I can't see that ever changing. I don't understand the burnout some people feel on this game, there really is still nothing quite like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's quite a shame that it has become "cool to hate" on Catan. Still a highly entertaining game that can be quite cutthroat among experienced players. I personally find it best with 4 and I'm not a fan of the 5-6 player expansions much, and nor is it as good with 3, but still worth periodically revisiting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Although I think I may have finally played it to death, still an all-time classic and the game that got me into the hobby.  Too much negotiation and kill-the-leader for me to rate it higher than an 8.
**Update (01/09/06): Lowered rating to a 7.  This usually only gets played with six people, so my rating reflects how horribly long it can be with that many.  I'd give this game an 8 with four players and a 6 or less with six playrs.

This is a classic entry point to Eurogames for newbies.  However, it can be frustrating for new players if they place their initial settlements badly.  It is not so fun for me because it is heavily dependent on dice rolls.  And then there is the fact that the game can take forever as people try to request ridiculous offers for resources.  Near the end of the game, nobody should be trading with any player that has a chance of winning, so that should speed things up... but then players end up stuck, not being able to make progress on their own, and then possibly losing half of their hand to the Robber.

I was shocked when I won my very first game of Catan.  I thought I didn't know what I was doing.  This may have been entirely true, but I applauded that the game had multiple ways to win.  The strategy employed by my friends was different than the one I used on my own.  Simple to understand and easy to set up, Catan is a great introductory board game for the uninitiated (like myself). 

Now that I own a digital copy on my Playstation, I've been trying to play as much as I can to stay fresh.

A light game with good depth of strategy and high repeat play value. 
Modular board is easily disrupted from table knocks so difficult to play with little kids around.
There is a lot (too much) strategy in the setup and a somewhat premature ending (ends just when things start to get going).
The limited use of dice adds a nice 'take that' mechanic, spices things up nicely without being too random.

RATING: 6.5
A tad luck-heavy with the robber and the resource gathering, and what I really don't like is the deadlock mechanic - once a road is set, there's no undoing it. It's nice that this makes the game progress, and it adds some underhanded conflicts to a seemingly low-conflict game - but I really don't like how this makes you unable to recover from mistakes.

But then, I only played the game like three times, and a long time ago. My assessment meanwhile might change. But I still do like games where it's possible to grab land from each other after and counteract against a strike of luck, and Settlers doesn't appear to easily allow that.

For a Euro type game, there is luck involved.  Although the trade mechanic is fun, it really is all about selecting the best location to establish your towns/cities.

If your numbers don't come up often, then you will quickly fall behind.  Initial placement, luck of the die and cards make a very large difference at the start of the game, but can be compensated via inter-player trade.

RATING: 6
This is the perfect middle-weight resource management, trading, and route-building Euro. Many games do some of the things that Catan does better - for example Bohnhanza is a better light trading game, and Genoa is a better heavy trading game. However, there is something about Catan that is lovely. It's deep enough to bring people into the fray while still being light enough (and intelligible enough) that folks who don't know much about modern Euro gaming can still easily jump in.

The only reason I don't give it a higher rating is for the "luck" factor. Now don't get me wrong, ALL games need some randomness in it, but I've played quite a few games of this, where I was playing a calculated and winning strategy, only to loose to someone who has never even played before.. It's still a great game, mostly because of the completly random board but it's not perfect.

Probably just a bad taste in my mouth after my college roommates and I played it to death and then some more.

Good memories but you never want to see them again. Ever.

The dice run this game, you just try to do your best with what they give you.  Initial setup is the most important part of the game, after that you just hope that the dice are kind.  You can go for a nice spread of numbers or concentrate on a few.  Either way the dice will go the other way and you sit there cursing for an hour or so.

It is only fitting that my very first post to this board be towards the first game that opened my eyes to a different level of board games -- and BoardGameGeek.

I would actually have given The Settlers of Catan a "10", if it were not for the expansions -- which are even better than the base game, in my opinion.

In any case, this was my first experience with a game of this type.  I grew up in a world of Monopoly, Life, Sorry!, Yahtzee, etc. -- all okay games in themselves, especially when playing with friends and family.  This, however, was the first non video game that really involved some strategy and thought -- and officially blew all of those previous family games out of the water.  It was an instant hit for this family of three!

We rarely play it these days due to our enjoyment of the expansions, but I would still look forward to playing it, if I did not have the expansions at my fingertips.

Overall, a wonderful game that involves thought and strategy, but is not overly deep to frighten gamers new to this realm.  I can definitely see why this is used as a "gateway game".

Respect the game for what it did for the industry. I'm sure if i got into gaming 10-15 years ago i'd like this a hell of a lot more. Still enjoy the trading and the mechanics of the game. A tad on the long side for what it is and don't care to being a slave to the dice roll.

Changed rating from 2.5 to 5.

Played this for the first time in 10 years.  It still has all the same issues: trading is pointless, initial placement is the most important decision in the game, too damn long.  But it wasn't excruciating.  And evidently my sister's kids like it so I will probably agree to play again.  So that's better than a 2.

Opposite problem of munchkin- runaway leader and way too much luck for my taste- effectively very often feels like a game where you may as well just sit at a table seeing who can roll the most 6s on a die. Often a frustrating experience, simply because even someone who is very good can get absolutely stomped by someone who has no idea what they are doing.

I'm sure when I got into gaming I'd have ranked this an 8 or so, but I've moved way past it. Still, it has a role as a gateway game.

I know this places me firmly in the minority, but I dislike this game. Settlers actually delayed by a few years my reunion with boardgaming ("This is the *premier* example of Eurogames?!?").  Two major complaints: 1)Initial placement seems to have an unusually large impact on the game (since the first few placements will be made on higher probability resources); 2) The trading aspect of the game really turns me off, since some players can be quite capricious during trading (but maybe that's more a comment on some of the folks I've gamed with).  Some of the expansions/variations do provide improvements on the basic game.  I'll still play this game, but I'll pick almost anything else if given the chance.

Great game. Now I can see why this is the game people are always talking about when they're talking about gateway games and modern boardgames. A true classic, which I can see getting a lot of plays, most of which are balanced. There is a moderate amount of luck, but a good player almost always will beat a bad player. It's also making success with people who aren't "gamers" and they even requested to play another matches. I really recommend this to anyone, it's easy, relatively quick, has lots of interaction, an adequate amount of luck and pretty components.

RATING: 6
This game was my first encounter with modern board games. The basic idea is great which grant you a ton of theme. We used to play it a lot, and im still happy to get it on the desk. It has easy rules, which means it is easy to teach. The robber is also a great addition to stop someone who is in front of you in terms of points.

Pros / Cons:
-Every game is different because of the constantly changing map and due to this always different opportunities.
-I love the trading mechanics that completly kills the downtime in the game.
-You roll a 7 and immediatelly start laughing while you are looking into the victim eyes is a fantastic feeling.

-I absolutely hate to be tricked by luck, so these dices are killing me sometimes (even if im on 8 and we always roll just 4-5-6 for example).
-You can be blocked right after the first few turns, and after this you don't have chance to overcome it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First plays are disaster, unhappy feeling since played by the robber...
After try to weaken the robber and knowing the good of the trading, the game become really fun.
Suggest to use some of the variants to weaken or change the behaviour of robber if you just don't like is so much as us.

Lowered my rating from an 8 to a 6 now that I've played both ways (randomizing the board and playing the 'beginner' setup). I realize this game isn't as much fun as I once hoped.  It's too random as to who is getting which resources, you can't really get any type of momentum going unless the dice are in your favor.  You can trade, sure, but if you have the same junk everyone else wants, you're out of luck.

You can get built in if other people are able to expand faster than you, and it can get to the point in a 4-player game where one or two people get 'eliminated' by the halfway mark of the game.

It takes too long for the level of depth.  Two hours for this game is absurd!  There needs to be more points in the deck as otherwise it's just not a wise investment.  Too many knight cards.

The social aspect of the game is fun but the game itself doesn't feel much more fun than games like Monopoly, because really, if you don't get the dice rolls and don't have the right stuff to trade, you lose - just like Monopoly.  At least in Monopoly when you get to the point where you know you can't win, you can just trade away your money and properties and go do something fun.  Here you get stuck being useless until somebody finally gets 10 points.

A definite classic.  I love it when I'm winning and I hate it when I'm not.  I do feel this game suffers from situations where you know you are going to lose and you are just going through the motions.  (By contrast, a sneaky play on a big city and a big field late in the game can turn the tides quickly in Carcassonne.)

Catan the base game is so fundamental to board games mainly for 3 reasons:

1.) It brought together a couple nifty mechanisms, most of all the modular hex board and trading,
2.) it kicked of the golden age of board games,
3.) it is the base for its expansion Cities & Knights, which is a truly formidable game.

Still good to play with young people, but usually I'll insist on playing Cities & Knights instead.

This game suffers from a lot of criticism due to its popularity.  But it remains one of the gold standards of gaming.

It is fun, relatively quick, simple and accessible.

And it's more than a gateway game : it represents the fun that board games can provide at a more elemental level, or the creativity that games can generate through its myriad official and unofficial expansions and house rules.

An essential part of the core of any games collection.

A classic, and highly rated in my collection because of its interactiveness and ability to be played by many family members.  This is truely a break-out game for introducing new players to board games. 

I have many of the expansions and variants, and have had fun building historical expansions.  (I modeled my own Settlers of Cannan with sculpey and cards, and have turned it into a historically educational variant...)  

You have a wide range of complexity, and a great deal of luck within the game, making it addaptable to many audiences.  Finnaly, the end game is very visually appealing, with all the pieces and tiles togther.  

Downside is storing all the pieces and parts, keeping instructions of all the variants, and setup time for many of the variants.  Another down side is getting players to not roll the dice into the board!

This game reached the status of classic.

One of its originality is the hex-tiled board that gets shuffled and put together so that at each game there is a new board. Awesome for replayability.

PS: When I first tried Settlers, the only games I had played were mass-market games such as Axis and Allies, Monopoly, and Risk. I didn't enjoy it very much. Two years later, I tried Puerto Rico and was hooked. So Settlers didn't work for me as a gateway game, but PR certainly did.

Too much luck, too political for me. The basic strategy is pretty thin: it's pretty easy to figure ou what is the optimal build. Most of the meat of the game comes from trading and politicking.

Simple rules. You are involved in other players turns. The initial placement at the beginning is the most important and strategic part of the game. There is a catch-up mechanism in that players will stop trading with the perceived leader(s).  The ending feels like in Munchkins where everybody is within 1 or 2 points of victory, then you keep playing until one player gets his lucky break.

B+ 

Very Good Game (like to play and never will turn it down).

One of the Best "Gateway Games" to get non-gamers to play games. Pretty much everyone who plays it loves it.

The simple elegance of these rules is superior to the more complicated mechanics of "Cities and Knights" and "Seafarers". The only improved versions are the "Trojan War" and "Wall of China" variants.

What is there to say that hasn't already been said? Catan is an interesting game in that it is a mashup of mechanisms. It's surprising that it's as popular as it is as it has a tendency to stall out early on. I grew to hate this game but have come to terms with it and haven't found many games that do so much so elegantly. Great if you can get a game in 45 minutes but it usually drags and becomes a bit much

Best with 4-6

RATING: 6
This was a completely new gaming experience when I first played this. There's a lot of luck with the resource generation, but it is really a matter of "covering all the numbers", or making sure you can generate/trade resources whenever you can. Easy to play, but filled with a wide range of strategies, and just the right amount of luck. I've used this as a gateway game to convert several Scrabble die-hards into enthusiastic Settlers fans! The Cities & Knights expansion adds another layer of complexity, and more tension. The 5-6 player expansions add yet another dimension to the game, with the addition of the "special build" reactionary phase. Seafarers seems to be suited for scenario play, but not much else. Initial rating: "8". Peaked at "9", briefly with the 5-6 player expansion.

Update (05/28/2009): 6 F2F plays. This is turning out to be a frustrating game, in terms of the trends in dice rolling. Some games are simply dominated by an preponderance of 5's, 9's, 10's... any number that I happen to NOT be on. Or it could go the other way; there have been games where several people sit around and cannot do anything, simply because the rolls are not coming up in the frequency that they should be based on statistics. Either the dice are funky (which mean don't play with the dice that came with the game), or this is just one of those things. The Law of Large Numbers indicates that eventually, EVENTUALLY, the dice will start rolling favorably. But this trough of bad luck could last most of the entire game, making play extremely frustrating. It may be time to start using the "number cards", because this is starting to break the game for me, as well as others. This is evidenced by the fact that most meetup members refuse to play this game because of its excessive randomness. Dropping to a "7".

Update (08/17/2010): Lately, it hasn't gotten the love it once engendered. Downgrading to a "6".

Update (12/21/2013): It has been 4.5 years since last play. It is a significant achievement in the world of board gaming, truly a "classic" in every meaning of the word right up there with Monopoly--a game that is even "better" than Monopoly. It was a great game for the period, but the group has moved on to greener pastures. It looks like the game doesn't have the legs we thought it had; since there is too much unmitigated randomness, it has alienated most of the veteran gamers I know. But, the design is a perfect blend of competition, negotiation/trading, randomness, and skill, with a very accessible rule set and game mechanics, I am sure it will continue to bring in and endear many new generations of board gamers to come. Still holding at a "6".

Update (03/13/2015): 7 F2F plays. Finally! After nearly six years, we played a 4-player, base Catan game! It's like a homecoming. We forgot some of the basic rules, but the fun was back. Nice, quick romp, just like Dominion--a classic that you never forget. Still a "6".

RATING: 10
This is the game that started it all for me. Now it's four years later, and no matter how many other games I try I can always be convinced to go back and play a game of Settlers.

This game is everything a board game should be. It's simple enough on the surface that anyone can pick it up, but there's enough depth of strategy that you'll be just as entertained on the 50th play through. Games are long enough to be satisfying, but you don't have to give up an afternoon to play. It has the perfect level of randomness; skilled players win more often than not, but it doesn't mean they always do (which keeps it fun for all). Last of all, the shifting board and the importance of politics make this game endlessly replayable.

The only con I can see is that sessions of this game have on occasion almost descended into fisticuffs over particularly jerk trades.

I'm sure a lot of people would be quick to tell me that I'm 'playing it wrong' but Settlers of Catan is just too damn random for me.

I give this one a 9 because it's not the MOST fun game i've ever played, and even though we don't play it often anymore it still is THE best gateway game in my opinion.  I can honestly say that I have never had anyone DISLIKE this game after playing it.  It's usually they're first REAL boardgame and it ends up being the best one they've ever played. Edit (2/4/13):  I've changed my ranking from a 9 to a 6.  I've grown so tired of this game that I cringe when someone suggests it.  It is a good game, but there are so many better games that I can't believe we're still playing this as a group.

I am aware that a hipster elitist boardgaming snob I'm supposed to hate Catan. And I get it, it has numerous problems from a game design standpoint., But I can't help but have fun when I play it nonetheless.

This is one of the first games that got me into the hobby, and though I've definitely moved on from it, I'll still bring it out when I have friends over from time to time. It has a lot of luck (and can be super frustrating if the dice don't go your way), but the trading and interaction in this game are what I really liked about it. Very light. While most people I've introduced it to have really liked it, a couple of people refuse to play it again because they sat there, turn after turn, unable to do anything. A good gateway game, though.

Played this twice just "for the sake of socialization". What happens when you have two 5s on woods from the very beginning of the game? You obviously get loads of clays, even if you have only one on a 9.

There is nothing else in the game besides rolling dices, and using common sense doesn't help if Loki himself don't want to collaborate. This was exactly the same in both the games I played. There is no strategy and there is only one path to victory, all players are aiming at the same thing, and loads, loads, loads of pure luck. Don't waste your time.

Pioneering game but ultimately frustrating.  Dice determine how much or little you'll be able to do on your turns, so sometimes you will literally be sitting there with nothing to do.

Wanted to like it since its so popular, but I just don't understand the appeal of this game. Most of the positive comments are just "wows", but fail to say WHY they like the game. I find it quite boring and mechanical. I also don't care for the trading aspect - if I wanted to trade like that I'd head for the stock exchange..... ;(  However, this cloud has a silver lining, in that Settlers introduced us to a whole new world of "German" or "Euro" games. Give me Tigris, Carcassonne or Samurai anytime!

I'm not a Catan hater like many others seem to be. I occasionally play it with some coworkers over lunch. Some people spend far too much time on the trading part of the game, which can make the whole thing drag. Maybe the trading why I'm so ambivalent about Catan? I don't think I've ever played a game with trading/negotiation that really grabbed me.

For "gateway" games of this weight/type I prefer Ticket To Ride.

Some gamers I know really do treat this game as a "disposable" gateway game but, actually, I'd be quite happy to play it again.  It is possible that I might have overrated it simply because I haven't played it for ages.  One thing I do recall is that the die rolling does make it very random.  The are simply not enough rolls of the two dice in the game to get close to the distribution of totals that you use as a basis for deciding how to place settlements, which is often quite disheartening.  Perhaps too random for a gamers' game and too complicated for a family game, but quite good fun none-the-less.

I think it plays better with four than three. Too much early Robber damage in a three player that you can't do much about while all you can do is pray that someone rolls a 7.... [Edit] In our last game we realised we had been playing the Robber wrong by having him stop production at any city/village he was next to rather than just the hex he was in . Doh! Still a lot of luck in this one, but maybe not quite so bad three compared to four now :)

Probably the best and most balanced four player game ever. Settlers defines simplicity in game play, which leads to wins by more than a few folks new to the game over more established players. The mechanics are a blend of sheer dumb luck, careful strategy, and some real good smak. I am the sheep king...baaaah........

Frustrating and slow to get moving if the dice abhor you from the start. The game gets better once more towns are built and there is an economy for real trading to occur. 

Regardless, there is no mechanism to affect dice rolls. If you have nothing worthwhile to trade and roll badly then you sit idle while your opponent's roads/towns corral you to a steady cancerous death. Unforgiving for a gateway game. This game will make you hate bad dice more than Monopoly. How did this game start a revolution?

A great intro to gaming game.  I can remember how blown away I was the first time I played it.  I think of this as a replacement for Monopoly.  (I always like the IDEA that in monopoly you would get to make shrewd trades for property, although it never worked out in practice.  Settlers brings the barriers to trading down to where people are willing to do it)

Great overall game, good for group interaction.  Concept and strategy are very good with multiple and dynamic paths to victory.  Games are usually balanced but lopsided ones happen occasionally.  Dice rolling means a small luck factor, but it's strategic enough that a few bad rolls won't break you.  Highly replayable.  Trading aspect is interesting also and means very little downtime during other players' turns.  The fact that gamers and non-gamers alike enjoy it is a big plus also ("no, not another movie... how about a game of Settlers?").  The cost of expansions and the possibility of a player being blocked off early in the game keep this from a higher rating.  BGG users have suggested several good variations for this one.

Not a game I seek out, but one I will always play if suggested by other people.

A math professor friend of mine taught me that the key to the game is analyzing the opening board.  You can always get beat by the luck of the dice, but knowing where the place settlements at the start of the game will mitigate random chance to significant margins.  Once you do that, the game itself becomes academic, unless at least two of the other players are similarly capable.

Basically, once you know the secret of Catan, you can only play against other people who also know the secret.  Unless you enjoy beating up on freshmen.

We play Settlers at lunch time when running our school holiday program, Kraftworks for Kids. The program is for kids aged 9 - 14. The kids really enjoy this game. We pair up the beginners with one of the Leaders while those who have played a few games are able to play without assistance. Sometimes we don't finish the game by the end of lunch but it can easily be resumed at the end of the day while waiting for parents to arrive. Lots of fun!

RATING: 10
The very essense of what makes a game elegant: simple rules, fun to play and there's nothing in the game that doesn't have a place or that shouldn't be there. OK, it's a probability-based game, so you can play optimally and still lose, while the random setup occasionally produces a board so imbalanced that the start player effectively wins by placing his first settlement. Overall though, a superlative game with bags of appeal to both gamers and families alike that would have entirely eclipsed Monopoly by now, if only Settlers were better known. This is the gateway game that I turn to whenever I'm playing with casually interested 'non gamers'. It's never missed yet.

I would rate this lower without the Cities & Knights expansion, but I don't believe in expansions rating higher than their base games, so this one is affected.  The only time I play just the base game is when teaching new players.  Settlers was the first game to nearly cross the dimensional lines and sit in the mainstream world.  I like to spread this classic 'gateway' game by giving it as a gift when the need arises.

Little too much luck for me but the game board and game mechanic however are second to none.

Often considered by many to be the gateway game into modern boardgaming, Catan shines through interaction with other players.

I love this game. I love building up settlements and cities, trying to balance my need for different resources against the desire to corner the market on one of them. The dice roll to determine resource draws (and to enact hand size penalty) means that early-game positioning provides real advantages but keeps comebacks possible.

The only complaints that I have are that politicking takes some of the fun out (everyone hates me because I am ahead! :[ ), and bargaining can stretch the game out too long -- the game is on the long side to begin with, so hagglers can make it seem interminable.

I've checked the rules, several times, and I'm definitely playing the game properly.  I just don't see in this game what so many thousands of others see.  There aren't enough die rolls in the game to give anything like a normal distribution of numbers between 2 and 12 and the robber seems a spiteful jest tacked on after the game was finished.  The game feels like one long die-rolling competition.  I'd rather just roll the dice once per player with the highest roller winning the game, and saving everyone 2 precious hours of gaming time.

I used to love this game, but compared to how far board games have come it has not aged well. Luck plays much too high a part and unlike newer games, the entire course of the game is determined in the first 5 minutes while you place your settlements. This can be crippling for beginner players, as there is no way to recover mid to late game if you make a poor start. But even good placement can mean nothing if the dice gods are not in your favor. Newer games allow for mistakes and provide greater player control. As it is I would be happy never playing this again. This had once been my go to gateway intro title, but that slot has been replaced by Alhambra, Lords of Waterdeep, and Stone Age. Compared to these titles Catan is clunky and inelegant.

My gateway game as a youth (in the original German version), played very many times, and subsequently not top of my to play list this days. But I do still like it. Seafarers is a must - we also had Cities and Knights but I don't remember playing it much.

Still a good game. Replayability is high, but it suffers from low player interaction (besides blocking & trading). Another major drawback is that the losing player can fall out fast, especially if they've been cut off. And in fact they can have no hope of winning early on. The mechanics are solid however and so many better games have been built upon this one. 10 when i first bought it, 9 in 2006. Talk about a game that stands the test of time though. Still a good game to introduce your friends to gaming.

El inicio de los Eurogames en mi grupo se llevo a cabo con este juego. Imprescindible para iniciarse. Mucho mejor a 4 que a 3.

There are so many better games out there.  For me there is far too much randomness in Catan.  If the dice rolls don't go your way, then you end up sitting there and doing nothing for pretty much the entire game.  Catan doesn't deserve be placed on such a high pedestal.  Mediocre at best.

RATING: 3
The highlight of this game is getting to  say you have wood for sheep. You have got to hate any game where despite tacticly sound play you lose because sombody else has lucky dice - Im not bitter but having got a monopoly on 5,6,8,9 and having a presence elsewhere you get pissed off after 12 rounds of getting 0 resources. All things being equal Once ahead you stay ahead makes playing with experienced players somewhat predictable. Congratulations on being so successfull but just like monopoly, success does not = good

Upgrading this one back to 5 after having played it more recently in casual context.  It is an easy and very accessible game to play, and it allows time for socialization and table talk.  It's an interesting game with a lot of trading, although there's still way too much luck and dice-rolling for my taste.

And the initial position determines pretty much 80% of who will win in the end (that and trading, but trading is very apparent and most people are on equal level).  So good fun, but not great.

Gioco che ha fatto conoscere gli autori tedeschi in tutto il mondo. Semplice e affascinante, piace sia agli incalliti che ai neofiti. Tra le geniali idee che ne hanno decretato il successo planetario: le trattative per gli scambi di carte tra giocatori, la mappa componibile e sempre diversa, l’assenza di tempi morti in attesa del proprio turno. A lungo andare, può pesare la componente fortuna legata ai dadi, ma resta perfetto per i tornei: veloce e mai banale.

Yes, like many people this was the game that got me addicted to board games.  However, after playing other, superior games for quite some time, each time I play Catan now I enjoy it less and less.

A game of luck and trading, Catan is a classic that opened the American market to a more Euro-centric arena of gaming. That said, Catan's tendency to kowtow entirely to a pair of d6 rolling erratically makes the game a quickly-eschewed pick of the community liking more strategy - myself included.

Okay, finally played the euro game most people here played before anything else. A friend heard I owned a copy but had never played, so he suffered through two-player Settlers with me so I could at least try it.This is a great game, although I can tell that it is not nearly as fun for two as it would be with three or four, and my friend swore that Knights is really what makes the base game fun. I appreciate what it did for the hobby, but I have other games that scratch the same itch that I enjoy more.

Traded the older version with several other games for several hundred dollars worth of Heroscape.

Catan is a piece of crap. There are too many turns where I feel like I can't do anything interesting. Occasionally I get the feeling that I should load this bad boy up on the Xbox. I inevitably play a couple games, remember why I hate this game, and then don't touch it again until I forget how much I hate it.

The popularity of the game is understandable, and it undoubtedly makes for a reasonable gateway game. Safe to say it's not one for me, and I've often deliberately sat out when others want to play it.

Like: The control over territory is interesting, with the ability to block certain routes and attempt to control certain resource types.

Dislike: All of the randomness brought about by constant dice rolling, with no way to mitigate it at all. The feeling of other people getting resources on your turn, while you get nothing and are unable to build, is incredibly infuriating. Potentially group-specific, but the discussion around trading can drag on for far too long.

The quintessential gateway game. It got me into modern boardgaming but it's mechanics haven't aged well.

Regardless of what you want there are more suitable games out there.

I played this many times over a year ago and stopped since we typically played with the expansions and found them time consuming as well as found new games to play that were intersting.  I played this again on Dec 20, 2006 with a group from work and it was refreshing to play again.  We played with another member's board so it was a little confusing since his game was the original series and mine was the recent version.  This game takes some time to setup and go over the rules, however it's simple once you have the hang of it.  It has just the right amount of strategy and luck to make it enjoyable for everyone.  In the game we played we were shorted brick so it was a scramble to build much with those components so we spent most of our time trading in goods for what we needed.  Rock and Wheat were in over abundance.

This game got me into board gaming and many friends of mine as well. The most enjoyable part for me, however, is the initial set up. Analyzing the varying board and proposing trades are the only parts of the game the player has much control over; luck plays a major role. While I have played this game countless times, the luck factor has ultimately gotten tiresome for me, this game is still a classic however.

An amazing, well-balanced, fun game with tremendous replay value.  I don't understand why some game fiends get snobbish about not wanting to play SoC, like they're above the game, deriding it as a newb game.  It persists to this day as--by far--the best selling import, and was profoundly influential in the explosion of the hobby for a reason.  I recall vividly, how when I viewed the back of the box to decide if I would buy SoC, I became extremely excited about how the game board is rearranged every play, which launches the replayablity into orbit.  The gameplay is impacted by luck via rolling dice, but the game is a winner, regardless.  The player interaction is superb in the trading of resource cards.  A player that is close to winning will find themselves unable to negotiate trades and that is a great catch up mechanic.  The player who is close to winning will also get frequent visits from the robber as well.  I have fond memories of many stimulating Settlers games played and I look forward to more.

It's Catan...

I didn't like this game very much, but it's what got most of everyone I know into hobby gaming. I owe thanks to it, but that's it. 

I view the expansions as additional modules. Some I like more than others, but in the end, I put it all under the Catan blanket rating because when I think Catan, I think about all of it as a whole.

I don't wish the suffering of playing this game on anybody.

Sold because I didn't like the version I had.  More interested in the better, newer versions but until I can play with more than 2 it'll not be bought.
Recently played 4 player and found it dull and annoying.  Not going to get this ever.  I'll also give away my Event Cards to Chris.

Don't believe the revisionists and the people who are too hip to like Settlers anymore.  This game is incredible. 

It single-handedly rejuvenated the boardgaming hobby.  

It is one of the most reliable games for introducing non-gamers to real games.  As such, its the game I still play most often.

Not much to be said about this one, as everyone in the world knows this game.  Nice game to introduce to non-gamers, quick to teach, has good replayability, and has sufficient randomness to prevent experienced players from hosing the newbies.  My problems with this game are plentiful, however:  it takes far, far too long to play - it's a simple game but games can be strangled by unlucky dice rolls or poor settlement placement which drags the game out significantly.  This is made worse if a player has been blocked because they didn't get early access to the road-building materials, which seems to happen to at least one player every game.

A classic game that has its problems, a nice one to keep for introducing to new gamers.

RATING: 6
Game plays quickly and provides solid level of interaction without being overwhelming. Enjoyable experience.

Update July 20, 2013
As geek user Glamorous Mucus says, "I actively avoid this game. Too repetitive, too few decisions, too much annoying futzing around with the resource cards, great potential for a randomly-selected runaway loser." Often the reason is because this game is played as a gateway with casual gamers which means, as a geek user Chally says, "that the game is usually filled with frustrating distractions, confusion, and interminable trading phases. Although I have no issue with the die rolling (even though I'm not usually a die-rolling person), I don't like the table-talk and kingmaking that the Robber induces on frequent sevens. It's essentially a decent light Eurogame with some of my least favorite aspects of Monopoly and Risk tacked on." While the experience can be okay with experienced gamers, why settle for a fine or okay 1995 game experience given what's out there now. I wouldn't even use it as a a gateway because it's too long for what it is.

This is a great game, no doubt about it. However, I have found myself getting real tired of it. I sometimes play with my family, mostly to humor them. The die-rolling is what gets me, if skewed in the early game it will be near impossibly to catch up later.

OWNED SINCE 2011
My first game into "modern" board games was Tide of Iron, for me, and Catan, for my wife and kids (bought at the same time). This is a simple game, but my family and I like it. My kids 8+ can all understand the rules and play it. I can bring this out and play with non-board gamers and get them to enjoy it, too. We have bought many, many board games since then, and still enjoy Catan. I am glad we have this game in our board game collection. 
     I do not like the tiles, they are not hard to set up, but impossible to keep in place. We place a huge piece of glass on top of them to keep 'em there.

This was the first Euro I ever played, and my wife and another couple were hooked on it for months.

RATING: 7
Catan (or Settlers of Catan as I will always remember it), is a good game. It holds up by having a very timeless quality to it. People can approach the game having never played anything like it, and they will quickly be able to understand and embrace its gameplay because it has a combination of elements that are at once familiar, but also unique in how the game presents them. 

Nowadays, I find that the game doesn't fit any sort of niche that satisfies what I look for a in a game. It's too random for when I'm wanting a satisfying strategic experience; it's too casual for when I'm wanting to get engrossed in a game; and yet it usually takes too long for a game I would like to play casually. 

I think Catan is the archetypal "gateway game", in that, I would only ever play it when using it as such (and know it would thrive being played in that capacity), but I have no real desire to ever play it of my own volition.

I feel a little guilty about giving a relatively low rating to a game which I've enjoyed playing many times, and which for a long time remained the game of choice when I'm with a group of non-board-gamer friends. But, the high element of chance in the use of dice to determine resources can sometimes make this a frustrating and excessively long game. The limit on the number of players is another drawback.

Solid trading game.  The dice are a double edged sword; On the one hand, the randomness and the flow of the game puts more focus on the actual trading and less on just having a full proof strategy, but it can also put you in a position you can never recover from.  This is a great game, but I can see it being frustrating to play if you over play it and find yourself the victim of poor dice rolls and the robber.

RATING: 9
This is the game that reinvented the board gaming  hobby, opening the eyes of the masses to the possibility that there was more to board games than Risk and Monopoly.

Settlers' popularity actually makes complete sense. The game is quite easy for new players to grasp giving it wide reach in terms of its potential audience. But what makes it really unique is that the game play appeals on so many different levels. Whether you like building stuff, or managing resources, or trading and negotiating, or rolling dice, or collecting sets, or building an economic engine... there really is something there for everyone to enjoy.

One of the real highlights for me is the free-trade mechanic, which I haven't seen much elsewhere. The economy self-regulates based on the availability of resources and stage of the game. Someone might pay you three resources for that brick now, but two minutes later its worthless! It's fun to figure out what kind of deals you can pull together each turn and it also keeps everyone constantly engaged.

Obviously the variability of the game is a huge plus. The hexes are laid out in a random order each game, the numbers which determine resource frequency will also change. You can try out different strategies by using development cards or ports. And there are some neat organic catch-up mechanics like the robber and negotiation, which mix things up and lead to many very close games.

I have played probably 200+ actual person to person games of Settlers and I still really enjoy it. These days I play it most often with the family or with newbies as there are better games for a truly strategic head to head. But nevertheless this is a versatile, elegant and highly repayable game - a must have for any collection.

I really believe this is one of the greatest board games of all time.  Having had some time with German board games, I've learned that it's certainly not one of the best, but it will always have a special place in my gamer's heart.  One of the things I love about this game (for which it gets too little credit, I think) is the reaction of people who have never played German style games, but then play this.  It's like a whole new world is opened up.  Very special.

An excellent gateway game for the hobby and a game we still break out a few times a year but especially anytime we have new people over that aren't 'boardgamers'.  The rules are simple and easy to pick up quickly and the sense of accomplishment at completing houses, cities and roads keeps people coming back.  The minimal direct conflict (except the Robber) keeps things on the tranquil side.
5-6 player expansions work well in a jam but ideally we stick to 4-players as it minimizes the down time (a killer for new players).

Some seem bothered by the dice rolling in this game, but I believe that this limited randomness makes the game interesting.  The combination of this randomness and the tactical decisionmaking of the players (where to build, when to trade, when to take a chance on a card) in my opinion makes this a good but not great game.  Its ratings seem a bit inflated by the nostalgia of those for which this was the "gateway". 

UPDATE: The Xbox Live release of this has bumped it up a bit for me simply because it allows the game to be played much much faster.

Finally got a chance to play this one.  I can see why it was so huge in 1995, but I can also see why its popularity has gone down since then.  Good intro game, but not something I'd play regularly.  Nothing particularly wrong, just so many better options out there now.

Doesn't get much play because of all the new Euros. Good player interaction & some decision-making. I prefer the variants that add weight.

I host the local tabletop gaming club and was given a large amount of Catan and expansions and I hate nearly every aspect. I hate the set up time, I don't particularly care for the rulebook, the gameplay always seems to confuse new gamers and feels dated. I feel like we're all just rolling dice hoping to get some card to use to dump little bits of wood on a slippery pile of cardboard, outstaying it's welcome before the runaway leader is declared victorious. Its too easy for someone to get behind and not be able to catch up. I don't feel much thematically from it either. 
I also have Settlers of Canaan, which is very similar, but a static board, and I much prefer it for that. I can see the appeal in a Catan board, but even then, that's an investment I don't think I want to bother with. And it's not like I hate euros, I own a number of them and enjoy them very much, many times easier to play and teach than other styles (e.g. fillers, wargames, etc). 
I mean, Catan has been around and I'm sure it can and is a great game, but none of it seems to click with me or the majority of other players that were participating along with. I'm really starting to think that I'd be better off trading/selling the $150 worth of Catan stuff and repurposing it into a variety of newer games.

Civilization:City building:Resource Management:Trading:Negoiation

100  plays (most were computer version or online): Very addicting game in the discovery stage even though it is mostly luck dependant, especially when playing with equally skilled players. This is a classic example of how luck and dice do not automatically mean the game will be bad or broken, it is one of the main reasons the game is so fun but it can also get occasionally frustrating when the dice work against you. Expansions add a few more choices/decisions but the C&K is the only one worth the money and sometimes regular Settlers is really all you want. Rating this fairly high due to high fun factor and that "let's play again feeling", also this has high replay value and a few paths to Victory. My theory is the "greed" aspect of it is why it's so fun as well as "take that" when cutting off your opponet's road.

[u]UPDATE[/u]: After 100 plays this fell a little from a 9 but only a classic could see 100 plays and my rating won't ever fall below 8.5 even though it doesn't see much play now. It also gains extra points for it's "uncanny" ability to win over non-gamers to the hobby and we found some ways to play with 2 players as well. 

[u]UPDATE[/u]:8.5 => 7.5 What can I say, after playing a lot more other games I now don't like playing this much (mostly due to the high luck factor), it especially becomes too long for what it is with 4 people. If you are new(ish) to the hobby this is still a great choice.

Ah, Settlers... so classic, so important to this hobby. If you have not played it, then please go get a copy and do so now. You won't regret it. While I don't have much desire to play anymore (I have moved toward wargames and other stuff), this game is too solid to not have played at least a few times in your life. And when I am convinced to sit down and play a game, I always enjoy myself more than I expected.

It annoys me that this is not higher up in the BGG rankings.  This is the superlative game.  It is short, it has endless replayability.  Each game feels completely different even after thousands of games (which I have played).  A beginner can win on their first try although the game rewards experienced play.  Everyone is involved in the game on every turn.  

And best of all this game is FUN FUN FUN.  If you haven't played this yet then what on earth are you waiting for???

One of the first German-style games I played, I played it so often when it first came out I am now burned out on it.  The problem is that it is very easy to have execessive down time due to your number never being rolled.  I will play it once per year - thats it. I will make exceptions if there is a newbie who has never played (because it is a very important game in the hobby's history) but I never ask to play it.

One of my earliest Euro when I restarted boardgaming in 2014. This is when I realized that some games can be rules light and yet very deep in strategy. However Catan didn't stand the test of time since it started to fall back in pecking order once I found out more and more games. The game of Catan can really drag on if everyone is trading conservatively. Sold it since game barely sees play anymore.

A classic game for most occasions, can go slowly on occassion, although with the 5-6 player addition you get to build at the end of each players turn.  This speeds the game up, and the addition of the Events Cards keeps all players in as the probabilities are fixed - although that can lead to depressed players, when the 12 comes up and then no chance again until the deck is shuffled.

I do not normally mind dice in a game; some games are actually good with dice (from Backgammon through to Bluff (Liar's Dice)), but how this is viewed by anyone, let alone so many, as a great game is beyond my comprehension. Sorry. 

Maybe it is just me who thinks this game is a pure luck-fest from start to end.

It doesn't deserve 3 stars IMO, but there are games actually worse than this!

My first real game, and it holds up reasonably well. Dice can be frustrating but it's not really about the dice. It's mostly a bargaining game. The board itself is relatively straightforward to figure out where to be aiming for, you just have to hope the numbers you need come up or barring that you can convince someone to give you what you need.

I struggled with this rating.  If you'd asked me in 2003, I'd have given this in 10.  I grew up playing classic American games (Monopoly, Stratego, Risk, etc.) and this was the first "eurogame" I played.  I played this game exclusively for a couple of years and then though "if I have so much fun playing this, maybe there are other, even better games out there!"  Then I got Puerto Rico and the rest was history.  I played this again a few months ago for the first time in years and kind of hated it.  Just so random.  But if you're just getting into the hobby this is a great place to start.

Once a great gateway game for non-gamers but there's better choices now. Heavy luck factor which can be shifted with a "deck o dice" though most people don't like using the cards. I played this often with only 2 players, there's just limited trade opportunities. With the 5/6 expansion games tend to run VERY long and I played that expansion just once and instantly turned around and resold it.

I was introduced to the game a few years ago by a very good friend of mine. The original German edition was used and I was immediately hooked, despite having to ask from time to time what was written on the dev cards. Luck plays a big role in the game, but a good mix of strategy/tactics and trading skills can make a difference. Some games turn out to be pretty tense and I've seen a few harsh quarrels arise, but everything is forgotten eventually (at least until the next game).

I will forever be thankful that Settlers introduced me to the world of board gaming, but it just doesn't hit the spot like it used to.

Trading is vital, but it also tends to consume a lot of time. You also can't effectively pre-plan your turn because your own dice roll will change what you can do. You don't realize how slow this game can be until you play some fast games.

Also not a huge fan of dice with no alteration mechanism like you have in Stone Age, Castles of Burgundy, Alien Frontiers, Euphoria, Kingsburg, etc. Pretty hard to inject any of those mechanics into Settlers though.

This was probably my first introduction to modern board games and was quite fun in that context.  After more time in the hobby, I've moved on to other things, but I'll keep this on my shelf for nostalgia and the occasional play with someone who still thinks Monopoly is a game worth playing.  I prefer to play with Cities & Knights expansion.  I do not like Seafarers.  I have no experience with anything else that may have come out since then.

RATING: 7
Still a classic but a bit burnt out on it.  You randomly generate a board using hex tiles, each with a terrain on it and each with a number.  Each turn you roll two dice and anyone who has a town or city built at a corner of the hex gets a resource card corresponding to the terrain.  Then you turn in the cards to build roads, towns, cities, or special action cards.  There is some fun strategy to where to build your towns and roads and outmaneuvering your opponents.  In some sense, this is a civ lite, building up your little empire.  I enjoyed working out the strategies but now that I have them down, I get frustrated by the element of luck as bad rolls can really blow the game.  Sometimes the two dice just want to reward the player who claimed the "2" tile for no good reason.  :P

I appreciate this game in the context of its historical contributions to our hobby.

But it's not that good.

Everything it does has been improved on by some other game.  There are better trading games.  There are better games with variable boards.  There are better set collecting games.  

Also, there's a lot of downtime, particularly when there's one resource in short supply, and everybody's angling for the same thing.  And any early leader is going to get pummeled by the other players - usually well beyond the point where they can get back in the game.

It's not a bad game, per se.  There are just so many better options now.

Nostalgia makes me want to play Catan once every six months or so, but I always end up disinterested by the end of the game. It doesn't take many plays to see how erratic dice rolls (e.g. when a two is rolled more often than a six) or missing out on the best starting placements can take players out of the game. Catan is an important milestone in the history of board games, but newer games have improved on what it has to offer.

Our gateway game.  We've played the classic version a lot since we got it, so we're pretty tired of it, hence the lower rating.  Initially though, we loved it, even with two players with a dummy player.  We've moved on from it though, mostly because there isn't much hope of catching up to a dominant player once they get ahead, and once that happens it can be a slow, drawn out endgame.

Who doesn't enjoy Settlers of Catan?  A really fun game to play with the family and a great gateway game.  I prefer to play with the gold variant. If you don't get any resources on a roll you get a gold coin.  On your turn two gold coins can be traded in for any one resource.  This makes that game move at a much quicker pace and nobody is bogged down for multiple rounds without getting any resources.

I know I'm a bit of a black sheep, rating the "father of modern games" sub-par, but to be honest, it's just not my favorite.

I'll admit - it could just be my lack of Catan-skill, but I find the game frustrating more often than not.

RATING: 8.5
Preferable due to length of play and easier/more inviting for casual players than some similar games.

I find that eventually it only seems preferred with 4 people, despite it working decent with 3, there are other games I'd rather play with 3.

Settlers is a game I need to be in the mood for, but when the mood strikes, it's always a good choice.

I guess a fraction before Carcasonne, this got me into a new type of gaming (after playing cards, Risk and Games Workshop titles). Often having to play with a cobbled together 2 player variant, I guess I've not yet got the full interactive measure of this. But I'm not a fan of bluffing games, which may be the joy in the trade phase for many, so maybe it'll keep gathering dust...

RATING: 7
This game is overrated. I like it a lot, and it's very fun. Also great to introduce non-gamers. But let's face it: it's barely less random than Monopoly. The endgame sucks.

Settlers is an unique game, and is worthy a spot in every home as one of the best games ever made. I personally recomend it together with Cities &amp; Knights. Some prefer Seafarers. Its a matter of simplicity vs depth where C&amp;K have the Depth and Seafarers keep the simplicity of the original. The 5-6 player expansions is a &quot;must have&quot; if you have enough friends.

RATING: 6.5
Ye olde board game. Yes, it has a huge amount of luck and the initial placement can ruin the game for you. It is not completely balanced and all the time it seemed that 3,4,10 and 11 are more frequent than 6 or 8. But the amount of back-stabbing is rather small compared to the more "competitive" games.

This new classic is a favorite that I have played many times.  Build a colony to get 10 points before the other players.  There is luck invovlved in what resources you recieve, but good placement of settlements and cities can help balance the luck.  Trading for what you need is almost necessary to win consistently.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun game, perhaps I've played it too much!  One of the most reliably varying simpler games around due to the dynamic board setup, such that it's always a good battle with 4+ people as each game will be so different.  The one thing that stands out is that periods of dice droughts in the mid-game can make the game feel a real drag sometimes, as it's like watching your teeth get slowly pulled, seeing the game slowly slipping away, and with nothing you can do... all while taking depressing two second turns (with your one or two resource cards) while everyone else takes long turns doing many things.  But that aside, it's certainly a fun game.  And definitely enjoy the Cities and Knights expansion as well to spice things up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of our household favourites... simple to learn & play, with a high level of interraction (trading) between players... however, I find the "luck" dynamic a bit too strong due to the high dynamic of die rolls to obtain the resources necessary to achieve victory.

I really like the degree of social interaction in this game versus the other Euro style games in my collection, and it's always easy to find a group to play with. This is one of the games that got several of my friends involved in the hobby.

The only reason I don't suggest (or play) this game more often is that it can easily lead to out-of-game conflict among some competitive gamers.

Traded for Puerto Rico after I realized everyone I play games with owns their own copy, and it's my duty to bring more unique games to the table.

I played this game a lot with my gaming group. The first time I played this I thought it was a stupid game because you dpn't seem to need any skill in order to win. Which I did the first play.

But later it turned out that the starting positions almost decide for 40% if you will win this game or not. That plus the fact that I played this too many times, makes me not want to play this again, unless it will be with other people I haven't played with.

I give this game a 6 with the Seafarers expansion.

A solid and fun game and can be quite tense towards the end of the game. Lots of player interaction and the robber can often prevent runaway leader problems.

There is a huge hidden strategic element in this game. So far it seems that trying to trade a lot is a great strategy towards winning along with trying to get your settlements on different numbers as opposed to getting a few big numbers to cut down on robber screwage.

Again, like Dominion and Carcassonne, the plays recorded don't represent the number of times I've played it. It was my gateway from enthusiast to hobbyist and will always have a place on my shelf, but my desire has waned significantly.

While Settlers is better than most older-style board games, it has enough flaws to make it less enjoyable than modern games. You can lose the game before you've even started due to beginning placement, and the dice can fail to roll even the most common rolls with any consistency. I *do* enjoy it, but to a lesser extent.

Got this in the mail.  Wife, daughter, and I played it, and it was a very nice game.  Since we've played Settlers of Canaan so much, it's hard to stop calling the robber the plague.

I like the replayability of this game with the mixing up of terrain hexes and port tokens.

Downside: harder to setup and no point tracker.

Update: Since sold Canaan. I really enjoy this with Seafarers and the Fishermen of Catan (Traders & Barbarians).  Family likes it that way too.  One of my favorite games.

The game (after Risk) that introduced me to the whole enchilada. I loved it when I knew only 5 games. I have fond memories of it but now, with so many fine games, I don’t find myself eager to play it again, but I’m sure I will. I really like the negotiation mechanic and the modular board gives a high replay factor. I have to recognize it’s a great game.

I think Settlers illustrates well how not to implement randomness in a game.  Random battles work well as risk management.  After all, the players in, say, Nexus Ops, get to build up troops and at least see the satisfaction of something happening that they caused, even if it's the hot laser death of their own strike force.  Random income, on the other hand, means a highly frustrating experience for the players whose numbers don't come up, since for them nothing happens at all.  It just isn't fun to sit and watch other people grabbing goods.  For all the game's virtues, and there are many, there are too many turns where the only thing to do is roll the dice and pass building.  (Trading is great in theory, but if you don't get any resources anyone else wants due to crappy dice rolls, you're not trading anything, no matter how much of a social butterfly and great negotiator you may be.)

Will only play with Cities and Knights and the Fishermen of Catan expansions.  It was dry without those, but magnificent with them.  Also hate playing with 4+.  Our family has multiple copies of the game, so we just get more than one table going at a time if there are more than 4.  The best is a 3-player game!

Feb. 2013 Update:  We have now been playing some of the Traders and Barbarians scenarios and love those too!  Catan will always have a place in our home.

Good family game.  Easy to learn.  Alas, I have become bored with it after a few games.  It appears to me and mine that the title should have been 'The Longest Road Wins' as it seems 4 out of 5 times that is the case. 

I hate wooden dice.  I am surprised, given the country's engineering reputation, that German games would come with dice that are made of a material that is non-homogeneous thus reducing the randomness of the roll.  "What?!  A 12 again?!"

My first "German" table game, and still a classic.  Great for introducing newbies to real games.  That said, there are others that are better for the time length.  This game suffers slightly from the luck of the dice.

***On the 10 year anniversary, it's time to move this down.  I know!  It's heretical, but really, I only want to play this once every couple of years or so.  It's too long as a four player game (excruciatingly so for the one player that gets squeezed early), and too lucky for the length as a 3 player game.***

RATING: 8.5
the classic - very tight and competitive in standard 4 player version, with a nice definite ending

RATING: 6
Very solid game. Some odd issues with getting locked into an area with no room for expansion whatsoever, which can certainly be annoying enough to want to quit, but those moments are honestly pretty far between. It's easy enough for casual players to pick it up quickly, and just complex enough to build strategies around screwing other players (which is something I generally enjoy). 

The randomization is also off-putting, but the ability to trade with other players and the pace of the game help mitigate that a bit. 

My final gripe would be the openness of victory conditions. As soon as someone is close to winning, everyone sees it immediately and guns for that player/refuses to trade anything with them. 

Overall, very fun game that I'd recommend when you have some more casual players around. Great entry level game.

Cities and Knights of Catan has replaced this as the 'Settlers' game of choice... so my rating for the 'basic' game has gone down.

Rolling for resources. 

I. hate. it. 

Not getting that resource? Nothing to do in your turn but pass. Not being able to do anything in your turn is just a bad game mechanic. This game is such a bore fest. Yes, you can mitigate it somewhat by smartly placing your starting towns, and negotiate for trades but still at the core, this game is frustrating to play.

This is much more tolerable on PC version where downtime is very small, but in real life with others sitting on table?

My gateway game: This is the game that got me into the hobby! Still one of my favorite games (especially when played in conjunction with the Cities & Knights).
I was introduced to this game back during my Junior year of high school where I played it once (2005). I purchased the game on New Year's Eve 2007. However, I never really got a chance to play it that much because I knew that we would need 3 or more players...
Fast forward to January 2016: I had joined my gaming group, and I got to start playing the game again. After this, I had started learning about other games, but this one is a classic!

Unlike most here, I DIDN'T play it to death in the 90s, so it's fresh to me. And I like it! Right up there with TtR IMO.  A very skillfully designed game. Fun to boot. Its elegance is part of its appeal, so I have no desire to play any of the subsequent versions-- at that point I'd rather play something more modern. The Atlantic got it right: "Settlers' recipe for success can therefore be seen as this: a well-designed game, devoid of a geeky patina, incubated by early adoption into a nerd culture that has become increasingly mainstream."

Gotta give some love to "Settlers" (not giving in to the mass-market re-branding hype.)

This game deserves an emphatic 10 because it is a landmark in the development of modern boardgaming. It showed that the best rules-mechanical insights of wargames could be brought to bear to other kinds of boardgames to improve their designs too. Today's games are more interesting and challenging than all but a few favourites from my childhood.

Klaus Teuber didn't do this single-handed, but Settlers was a big contribution. It's great fun to play, and will long continue to win many new fans.

This is a great game! I wouldn't turn down a game of it if asked.
It's different every time you play but this is more of a lucky game that let's you think you are in control and that strategy is involved. You make decisions that's true, but most of the time the decision you make is obvious or the only choice you have. This game I know very well and may that's part of my problem, the unpredictable random nature of the dice role is too random? This game does escalate well if not evenly and the race for the final few points is enjoyed by one or two at most. .. often the other players have been left behind and for them the game ended a few rounds ago. Still for all my nit picking complaints...I wouldn't turn down a game.... is that this games magic?

My gateway game and probably yours, too.  Though I've arguably "moved on" from this game, I'll never pass up a chance to play it.  My wife enjoys playing vanilla, but I like adding the River (you might hate it, but I like it), Fisherman, Catan event cards, and Cities and Knights.  Looking to add Seafarers but I need an older copy.

A lot of people hate on Settlers after they graduate to other gaming mechanics, but I think this is wrong.  Settlers is what it is - a VERY well-thought out game that offers much replayability (tiles, resource markers).  

Combining Settlers with its expansions--I like to play with The Great River, Fisherman, Event Cards (for the events only), Harbormaster, and Cities and Knights--makes for a long, but enjoyable, experience.

I would recommend this game to anyone trying to get into board gaming, and I'd gladly play Settlers with anyone, even after all these years.

Settlers definitely has its place in the history of euro games. That said, the state of the art has advanced, and viewed objectively, Settlers isn't all that great of a game. Luck plays a huge role, and while it can be mitigated somewhat, it is always an issue. Additionally, it is very common for at least one player to be out of contention early. It's no fun to sit around and wait for the game to end. Kingmaking is another major problem. Those players out of contention early?  They often deck the game by how and if they trade towards the end. That's no fun. I've played literally hundreds of games of Settlers, mostly on Xbox Live, as well as in several tournaments. Looking at my library, there are very few instances where I'd rather play Settlers than any of my other four player games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Relatively a good game. Positives- always ok if you are experienced and can get on intersections of diverse resources, strategy and politics are very high and it's not really hard to teach. Negatives: gate teed to always start a fight in groups with one or more competitive people. Argument over rules and always having people voice to the fairness of the game. And random chance could have players stuck in a slump for many turns on end where they do nothing at all. 

Overall the first second and third playthroughs are awesome, after that the politics of the game and chance and prefrencial treatments/attacks on players will upset people and usually dampens the whole night. Great for a group with no spikes that want to win and tons of people that are happy playing even if they lose. E.G. Sometimes I lose on purpose so others won't flip table!

Catan is an important game in terms of nostalgia and its impact on the hobby, but it hasn't stood the test of time very well. It is noted mainly for its trading and accessible empire building mechanics. The major downsides are how critical one's starting position is (a big disadvantage for new players), a lack of dynamic interaction, and the limitations and monotony of rolling dice for production. I will only play with the Cities and Knights expansion (the base game feels a bit "samey" after several rounds), and only when the mood strikes me (which is less and less). All that being said, Settlers is an admirable gateway game for kids or those who are new to the hobby.

Probably my all-time favorite game. I never seem to get tired of it.  I've played it literally hundreds of times.  I have a friend who played it 30 times in a row one night.  She does admit this probably wasn't a great idea.  There is a lot of luck in the rolls, and no game is complete without everyone constantly whining about bad rolls.  Someone on BBG calls the game "Whiners of Catan," and ain't it the truth!  As soon as someone stops whining, it's time to start stealing from them.

Not much to say really that hasn't already been said. Awesome intro to board games, but there are more fun games out there for sure. That said, I am not likely to turn down a game of Settlers.

I cannot help but agree with much of the recent criticism -- this game is showing its age a bit. I would probably play it if people want to, but there are many other games that I would rather play.

I really enjoy this game, although I rarely have the chance to play at home as it requires more then 2 players. It's competitive, but as you aren't playing directly against the other players, and rely on good relations to make successful trades, it avoids overly aggressive play. The variety of ways to earn victory points means each person can choose a strategy to suit them. This is a well rounded game, and its use as an educational tool is excellent to see.

Disgusting for several reasons
1) After the initial placement of settlements it is easy to tell who is most likely to win.  I hate the fact that the likelyhood of a win is influenced by your ability to roll a high number in determining placement.  
2) There are two types of players.  The loud ones who beat you into trading with them so they'll just shut up.  And the ones who aren't sure what they want to do.  
3) There are very few interesting decissions.  Often the game plays itself.  It's like Ticket to ride, but without the tension.

This game is a staple in our house, and the favorite go-to game among all our friends.  Occasionally we'll venture away from the game to try another, but we always come back to Catan.  The game is extremely repayable as the board game is set up differently each time you play, offering different strategies and obstacles to overcome every time.  This game isn't too heavy.  It doesn't feel like a game of chess, but it's not all up to the dice rolls either.  The balance between luck and strategy is like milk and cookies, a perfect balance and combination.

Burned out on this one.  Games take too long, even without the Cities and Knights expansion.  Will only play this with people familiar with the game, newbies take too long!
Also game is far too unbalanced - a player that gets ahead is hard to stop, which makes a long game painfully boring if you are loosing.  Little to no chance to catch up if there are some unlucky die rolls. Used to love it, but now . . .BLEH!!!!

I'm playing my first game with some friends, some have played, others haven't.
The game dragged terribly (over two hours for a 4 player basic game, after setting up and going over the rules - but it seemed like three or four hours of play), especially when players asked again and again (and again and again) about the same trades that no one wanted to take them up on.
One player spent the last hour of the game involved in another conversation entirely, and not paying attention at all, but then got the "Monopoly" card, and was able to win the game.
I can't believe that the game has such a broken card that a player who isn't even trying can luck into it and gain 6 victory points in one turn to win.

Yes, I could be persuaded to play again, because I have friends who love this game, and I enjoy playing games with them.
I will also keep my travel edition for classroom use (although I may have to "lose" the monopoly card).

The one that started it all.  I was introduced to The Settlers of Catan around 2003 or so, when I was in grad school.  I bought a copy and my wife and I have worn it out.  We always played two-player without any rules modifications and really enjoyed it.  It hasn't hit the table much lately, but we did try a two-player variant recently that I think played much better.  We haven't played since I started logging plays;  I'm sure it is well over a hundred.

This game is silly, what is all the fuss about?  In fairness, I haven't played it much, mostly because I don't feel like memorizing the costs of the various building components, and I generally feel that trading games are lame, and not totally fair.

2015-10-01: Despite my previous comments, I do still find myself wanting to play this one and it is requested in the game group. I'm thinking I might try some of the scarcity variants to help offset the die-rolls. Re-rating to a 6 (from 5).

2015-03-26: My initial rating here was a 7, but I think I'm going to downgrade that. I've re-bought this one and replayed it several times in the last month. What I've noticed, especially for new players, is frustration when you don't get any new resources on your turn and "can't do anything!" It has that sensation of a roll-and-move, where you essentially can't move anywhere. Yes, trading should help to mitigate that, but sometimes no one will trade.

RATING: 8
Perfect blend of strategy and chance. While I can sympathize with those who say there is too much randomness here, I have consistently seen strong players win by positioning themselves to take advantage of probability. Mitigating the risks of chance is a big part of this game. Brilliant in its accessibility and broad appeal.

EDIT: After playing a few more times with casual gamers, I'm reducing the grade to an 8. The set up and site selection, unless you use a pre-set configuration, really does set some at a severe disadvantage. While I don't mind at all the randomness of the dice roll, it is never fun when you don't feel you have much of a chance from turn one, which can happen in this game. Also, I find that getting to that last victory point or two can be painfully slow. I usually target a number a point or two lower than recommended.

Un clásico para no jugones, aunque cuando se adentran en este mundillo pasan rápidamente de este juego (como me pasó a mi).

No es una mala opción si se quiere para jugar con no jugones, pero si no mejor hazte con otra cosa.

Creo que es demasiado dependiente del azar, y tras una mala colocación inicial tu partida puede haber acabado.

Would have been rated higher a few years back, when it was the only clearly identifiable "Euro" game out there.  But, the luck of the die rolls makes this one much less likely to hit the tables these days with so many "gamer's games" that have come out more recently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Hard to argue that this game is anything but great. It's broad popularity among casual and committed players alike attests to the quality of its design. That said, I find it rather dry and, if early dice rolls don’t break your way, it can be a tedious exercise in frustration tolerance. The board game boom that Catan helped create has produced many other titles that transcend what Catan itself has to offer.

My vote for the best game ever invented.  Should be played as is, without expansions.  I don't care if its ranked 100 or whatever: Settlers is the greatest.  Even 15 years on there are still no better games out there.
Why?  First would be that every game is different, right from the start.  The modular board presents the players with a significantly different challenge each time - not many games do that.  Second, there is very little downtime.  Third, there is genuine end-game tension, not present in most multiplayer euros.

The version I have was pretty cheaply made. The puzzle water tiles have all warped, making them fit together poorly. The gameplay can be very random. Dice rolls, trading deals, card draws, and the placement of the thief make this game very lucky.

IIRC, I first played Settlers in 2006. Played 2-3 times, tops. There was some curiosity about modern boardgaming, so I thought I'd get a companion game to Settlers for the group, which ultimately ended up being Carcassonne. In other words, I pulled a standard Gateway maneuver many years after these two games were released, but I left Settlers behind so quickly it never made an impression on me. I played a lot of Carc (about 20 sessions), but half of that was at the request of more casual, non-gamer friends. So they responded to the "gateway game" while I was off and running. 

I say all of this because I came back to Settlers recently (10/28/09) for one session just to see how it would strike me as a died-in-the-wool, hardcore gamer. I don't have any nostalgia for this game. I never experienced it as the only game in town or as the forerunner of a whole movement. 

So to me, in 2009, Settlers is a distinctive but fairly unengaging game. In essence, the game is built around a random distribution of goods that is, in theory, corrected by manipulation of the odds and player negotiation. In practice neither of these things really do enough for the game. It does play quickly and simply. I've also read that 4-player Settlers is inevitably "an exercise in futility for one player, an exercise in false hope for another, and a real contest between the other two." That's been my experience as well. 

As gateway games go: TtR < Settlers < Carc < Pandemic. Althought as a cooperative, Pandemic doesn't really introduce people to the mainstream.

Played too much probably, but after trying out many of the various expansions it is hard to get into a game without using at least some expansion. Good for introducing people to tabletop gaming, but, even then, they'll probably also want to use an expansion after a game or two. 

Replaying again after playing many other games, the dice rolling determines too much of the gameplay for this to be enjoyable. If the numbers aren't in your favor, there is nothing in the middle of the game you can do to change that.

You buy and place buildings and roads near land that gets randomly activated to generate resources. You use the resources to upgrade buildings and generate victory points. It can seem light compared to more recent games, but has a certain elegance in its design and gameplay.

I have a lot of the respect for the designer, Klaus Teuber - it is a well balanced game with a 'story arc' as the game progresses (e.g. from everyone needing brick/wood to build roads/settlements to wheat/ore for cities, etc.) The downside is it's a tad long for the fun value (esp. when there are 1-2 'scarce' resources on the board), and luck is a bit high for more - the 'risk management' aspect of it only kicks in over multiple plays and you coold be stuck with a 2-3 hr game getting screwed by the dice rolls

(NB best expansion for this is Cities & Knights of Catan)

Played this for the first time and was very pleasantly surprised at how much fun it was. Definitely lots of luck involved (I couldn't get ANY resources the first half of the game), but it's still engaging and, most importantly, fun...I've only played about half a dozen times, and it's gotten old pretty fast. Actually, it may be that it's not worth playing with just 3 players, as the fun times I've had with it come to think of it, were with 4 players. With 4 players I'd give it a 6, perhaps.

Still, as a gateway drug, there is probably none better for a casual gamer to get sucked into Euros...

Like many others, this got me into gaming.  A brilliant introduction as it usually rewards clever play but is winable by gamers with no previous experience.  I have rated it quite low as I invariably play the Cities and Knights expansion, after which the base game seems less enticing.

In terms of component quality, the 4th edition is a step backwards compared to the 3rd.

Everyone I introduce this to enjoys it.  I'm a bit tempted to leave this copy with my father and pick up a new version so I can get the expansions (or possibly just the new cards so they all match).

I think we're about ready to add the 5-6 player expansion to let more people play or possibly the Seafarers so there is a bit more variety without really changing the core gameplay (which everyone loves but they don't really love learning extra rules).

This is a great game and the classic gateway game. Great balance and enough different ways to win to make each game interesting. I think the reason why it's a great gateway game is because at the start of each turn your options for your next move are usually very clear and it's just a matter of choosing one or the other and pressing your luck. New players pick up on this quickly and it gives what some might call the "illusion of strategy" without making the game feel completely luck based. Recommended to any potential gamers out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.8
Another incredible game.  I don't play it as much anymore, but it still comes out occasionally.  However, for people who are just new to the hobby, it's a great way to get them hooked.  and with the expansions, it just soars.  A high level of randomness turns me off a bit but this is also what appeals to non-gamers who have grown up on Monopoly and other "Roll and Move" games.
5/10/09 Update: This games rating has gone up to a 9 for the number of times we play it.  Easily over 50 ftof games in the last 2 months.  Has to be a 9 if it's played that much.  I now use it to convince all my "Non-gaming" friends to try board games.

I have the 5th edition now for about two weeks. The game is very simple and basic. It gets a bit boring as you're constantly rolling the dice to get resources. The game predicts 6s and 8s as the most common number rolled but we don't get that. We constantly get 7s and have to use the robber WAY TOO MUCH. And after that we get a lot of 5s, 10s and 11s.  Maybe the dice are loaded. Because the game is so simple I just added Seafarers to try and make it more challenging.

The game that got me started! I've played more games of catan than I care to count. And Xbox live has an awesome version of Catan that I've played to death, also.

Update: Trying playing it recently. Anti-climactic. It felt so rudimentary compared to what I'm used to. It may just be that Catan has a shelf life.

This is the game that got me hooked into euro style games.  Though you can get screwed by the dice rolls, you have a lot of control by trading and prioritizing builds.  The trading also keeps you involved, even when it's not your turn.  If you play often enough and for long enough, the luck tends to even out, and its a matter making good decisions.  I like that between the longest road, the robber baron, and special development cards, the lead can go back and forth, and someone can come from out of nowhere for the win.

Great game. 

After six plays I think it's time to move on... Still will be used as a gateway game at family gatherings. I introduced it to my 58 year old mother recently and she smoked my girlfriend and me on her second game. She really enjoyed it and wants to play it more.

Update: The last time we played this we had a very severe case of 'gang up on the leader'. Which was me. I had ten or eleven turns of no one trading with me and the robber was constantly moved onto my spaces. It was terribly frustrating, but I kept my cool.

My cousin Tom, who had the best chance of overtaking me, says he probably won't ever play the game again, which is fine with me. 

In the end I won by piling up on resource cards and stealing the Largest Army card.

Downgraded rating from a 7 to a 6.

As BGG User Broggi said"It is just as easy to make lousy deals in Monopoly as Settlers. I know people on this site like to bash Monopoly, but it is a lot closer to Settlers than most realize: random outcome based on 2 dice that can make or break you; trading is an integral part of the game; use resources to build buildings that are then used to gain more resources."

This is supposed to be the boardgamer's board game, and I enjoy it very much, but it's not one of my favorites. Doesn't work well with 2 players, which is fine, because it wasn't designed for 2 players. Good game for 4, however.

I've owned this game since 2004 and FINALLY got around to playing it (not even on my copy). I get what all the hoopla is about.  A pretty quick playing time, a lot of strategy, and while there is a huge luck element, I think that there are enough die rolls that it will generally even out over time.  I want to play this many more times.

Sure I had played Empire Builder and History of the World in the early 90's, and Supremacy and Axis & Allies back in the 80's, but Settlers is THE game that started the revolution for me. Efficient rules. Wonderful, pervasive theme. A little bit of negotiation. It's the roll of the dice and the fact that I've played the hell out of it that causes me to give it only a 7 versus everything else that is out there, but it will always be a nostalgic favorite.

RATING: 6
I can see why this game helped launch a movement. The actual mechanics are easier to see than explain on paper; the turns take just about the right length for me and give you interesting enough things to do. Of course, the hole you may be digging for yourself is your own grave as you drop further and further behind if you don't start off fairly strong or at least competitive. The midgame on can feel like a total drag if you're just treading water without much way of improvement.

The new Mayfair version is pretty nice, and there's absolutely no reason to get the older one instead. However, there's very little reason *to* get the new one if you have the old one unless sliding tiles was a real annoyance for you. In fact, I'm not sure how well the puzzle pieces will wear over time, and it wasn't that easy to get the hexes in it around the edges.

An extremely unimpressive game, to say the very least. The game pieces are poorly designed, the outcome of the game dependent on chance and the charity of others. There are some redeeming features however, including a geomorphic map and the fact that player interaction is strongly encouraged. The father of German games and epitome of everything I hate about German board games. No violence, weak supporting pieces - uggggghhh! Hopefully, this scathing indictment of a universally loved classic will go a long way towards balancing out the heavily biased opinions of gamers who started playing only from the mid 90&#039;s onwards, and do not know any better.

I think the bloom is coming off the rose here--this is the game that got me into the wider boardgaming world, but I'm finding that four-player games are increasingly agonizing, and long stretches of waiting for my number to come up, or for my number to come up while the robber isn't sitting on top of it, are not my idea of a good time.  Everyone else I play with seems to love it, so I'm hoping I can wean them off.  I'm not buying all these other games so that they can just sit on my shelf, you know.

EDIT: Oh, who am I kidding.  I just played this game, lost badly, and still had a really good time. 6 --> 7

I like Catan, and it is certainly a classic. I love it's universal appeal. My rating would probably be higher, but it sometimes drags on too long (especially with 5 or 6 players - NEVER doing 6 again), and some games are going to be miserable if the dice rolls keep you from getting necessary resources. 

I'd usually rather play Ticket To Ride - similar game, shorter game length, less susceptible to bad luck (most of the time).

RATING: 6
I find the robber ruins this game for me. I understand the intent is to "bring down" a player who has obtained a point lead, but I find that this mechanic is oppressive--the player who takes the lead is often completely locked out of doing anything for multiple turns. It also entices players to run a "secret game" by hoarding development cards... which makes the robber more active, which makes the leader's game more difficult. Essentially, whoever takes the early lead loses. ...And the game is entirely unenjoyable for her besides.

As a result, I've introduced three relatively simple house rules that I don't feel unbalance the game, and help lessen the impact of the robber without completely removing the intention of it:

1) If you roll a seven and the robber is not on the desert, return the robber to the desert. Resolve oversized hands as normal. After resolving hand sizes, take one free resource of the player's choice from the bank as a "reward" for routing the robber. (Thus the player who rolled the robber _may_ begin the turn with 8 cards.)

2) A person playing a soldier card MUST move the soldier (as normal), but may *optionally* move the robber to the desert (if he is not there already) and take one resource of the player's choice from the bank as a reward. 

3) After the robber blocks an area from resource generation, return him to the desert.

...The first two rules help keep a single player from getting repeatedly drubbed by the robber; the third rule helps keep the robber from completely spoiling one hex for essentially half of the game (in my experience, the robber really only ever goes back and forth between the two "best" places to put him).

-- OR --

...A simpler alternative is that the robber simply blocks production; it does not steal a card. The player who places the robber instead takes a single resource of their choice from the bank.

With this alternative, a player in the lead may be deprived of some production, but may still play her hand (and produce from other hexes), and "stay in the game", albeit with a penalty that shouldn't be crippling.

Another house rule I recommend (to make the game feel less "mean") is that the robber MUST be moved to the player with the highest visible score. If there are two players tied for first place, the robber will attack the player with more cards in her hand. If two or more players are still tied, it will attack one randomly (roll a die). ...The player placing the robber may still choose which hex to move the robber to, and the robber MUST still move when played.

For me, at least, these rules give this old game a few more legs and helps reduce frustration for most players.

Catan is a gateway drug for board games that has outlived its original shine. Dice rolls create irreparable imbalance, trading is too fickle, and getting locked out of possibly win conditions can happen early with no reprieve. You usually know who will win based on initial settlement placement.

My only few sessions with the UVA boardgaming club (or whatever it was called) involved playing this game and it was my first Euro experience.  I was disappointed that this was the kind of game that dominated the club, though I found Settlers to be decent.  I'm sure if I played it more now, I'd like it better, and I'm sure I will play it.  I do prefer a deeper theme and that's a major reason I'm slightly biased against Euro games.

I owe my gaming hobby to this game, which I have played countless times for many hours of fun.  My main problem is an inability to go after a runaway leader, which is why I really like Cities & Knights.  Though because of the increased game time, I don't mind playing vanilla Settlers at all.  In fact, I may even prefer it. 25 minutes versus an hour?  I'd choose the quicker one almost every time.

RATING: 7
Rating same as regular Settlers.  I picked this up on a whim, together with the Atlantis scenario, mainly because it was so cheap (they were bundled together).  In reality I would probably not choose to use this version, mainly because I prefer the wooden pieces to the plastic ones, and especially because of the German text on the development cards.

These days, on the rare occasions when I pull out Settlers, I usually reach for Simply Catan, due to its convenience and ease of set-up.

With City & Knights it is my favorite German game.  Without I still love to play it and it is great to play with the kids.  They can beat you !!

Very solid game! Like for so many others, this was my introduction to German/Euro-type games. Appeals to many types and ages of player, and has enough variation to be played, ocasionally, for a lifetime! The 2 major expansions, Seafarers and Cities & Knights are almost a must! But beware! If you try C&K you will have a hard time returning to plain old basic Settlers...

RATING: 6
Everyone says this is a great gateway game for non-gamers, but I have never found that to be the case. The game itself is pretty basic and extremely dependent on luck. There always appears to be one logical choice of action given your hand of cards, and given your roll. The trading element is extremely dependent on the group you game with. New gamers tend to trade not at all since they are unsure of the value of things.

[UPDATE] After further playings, I'm lowering the score. The game can come to a standstill if the right resources don't come up.

Great game, a modern classic. Like many here this was a gateway Euro game for us. We've played many 2-4 player games (using 2 player variant from the geek). I prefer 3-4 player, but when you can't get enough players 2 will do.
Recommended (for 3-4 players, or for 2 die hard Settlers fans).

One of my first played modern boardgames. But not the first one. From today's perspective, it contains too much luck and too little choice for my taste. But it was a good game for me those times.

Vienas iš pirmųjų mano žaistų rimtesnių žaidimų. Tiesa, ne pats pirmasis. Žiūrint dabar, mano skoniui per daug atsitiktinumo ir per mažai pasirinkimo. Bet tuo metu visai tiko.

The classic enjoyable trading base game. Played this a lot in my college years. Taught me the odds of rolling dice numbers and that sometimes, you can roll snake eyes four times in a row.. The beginning placement makes or breaks the game and after that you just have to pray for RNG. It can get a little disappointing to know you can't catch up.

EDIT: Is it fair to rate these classic games for what is it now or what it once was? Back then it would've been a solid 7.5. hah it hasn't changed much.

RATING: 8
Settlers is a very good intro game for newbies (myself included).  The game rates high for it's trading and building aspects.  The biggest flaw I find is the randomness of the game, which doesn't become evident until the end of the game.  I haven't played it enough to isolate when it happens but after settlements have been upgraded to cities, the player with the best rolls (and positions) clearly pulls ahead.  The other players can only hope for 7's to activate the robber.  Overall, a highly enjoyable game. It clearly deserves its popularity.

Nice, fun little game that I play when gaming time is short or I want a change of pace from a massive/complicated/long war game.  This game has almost infinite replay value due to the nature of the setup, but there are several strategies that work well no matter what the setup outcome looks like.  Not the "greatest game ever" as many claim, but it is fun, easy to learn, and got me introduced me to "German Style" games.  Game is great in its basic form or coupled with the available expansions (Knights & Cities is the best in my opinion). One thing I don't care for, the amount of luck involved in the die rolls for resources.  But, I guess it all evens out in the end.  Give this game a try!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I would rate it a 9 but in two recent games I got shut out of the competition by some spectacularly unlucky roles made me knock it down.  The fact that I could go 16 player turns without a resource when I was on the seven different numbers in one game and how the table could roll 6 on more than seventy-five percent of rolls leaving myself as the only player to not get rich in the other was just astounding.

And it was two different copies of the game so weighted dice is out.

This is a fun game for what it is, and was my "Euro" gateway game.  I think that there is a lot wrong with this game, from the run-away-leader syndrome from getting lucky, to the sometimes extremely bleak availability of resources sometimes produced from a random set up, but I will still play it most of the time when my friends suggest it, often as filler between heavier games.

It's almost as luck dependent on a die roll as Monopoly. Open trading and negotiation is cool but the theme is nonexistent. I'd recommend Cosmic Encounter as a superior alternative. While it has randomness in the cards and player powers, the negotiating, alliances, general silliness, and fun, are what makes it a better game.

A hour long game that can come down the to turning of a single card to finish it. The winning conditions are awkward leading to 'oh, I have won - that was a surprise.' type reaction. Also, players can get left behind in the whole development process.

A good game that was my personal introduction to Euros. I haven't played with a deck of dice but I would probably prefer it that way. My main concern is the attack the leader phenomenon which means that you have to be subtle to fool people into thinking you aren't doing well.

Unfortunately there is too much importance on initial placement and dice rolls.  I have to be in the right mood to play this game: you have to be willing to accept the luck of the die rolls and you have to be up for the trading aspect.  If you're not then this will be a long night of frustration.  All in all a decent game and a plus that newbies are often familiar with it and will play.

How I got back into boardgaming.  Since that time Ive come to realize this games faults (dice driven luck, I dont like the robber, and you can get stuck if people dont trade).  I dont want to be too harsh on it, I still enjoy the game and play it periodically.  You just have to take it for what it is.  A GREAT way to show others that boardgames dont have to be Candyland or Monopoly.

Re-rated from a 5 to a 6, based on the fact that I like this game, I Have a soft spot for it, and Ill usually play when asked and enjoy it win or lose.

This game will always be in my collection.

A fun social game, but victory can depend on initial startup position as much as it does on luck. The trading mechanic almost always goes bye bye when victory is close at hand.

This game takes everything I like in games, trade & negotiation, infrastructure building, resource production and management, and puts it over a system that makes me want to Gibbs-slap the designer.  I don't like it and will dodge playing it whenever possible.

One thing which annoys me little is that Settlers are still promoted like something special even these days.

A classic that deserves a lot of respect for introducing many people to real board games.  Just doesn't do it for me. I don't like how dice can determine the outcome of the game.  I don't like being handicapped by chance.  The trading does give a lot more player interaction than some games though.

Catan is good for beginners, gateway game etc. 

The more experienced gamers start to get put off by it for the simple reason that too much of the mechanic is put down to luck. It's just a fact that too much of the time people who should have won don't and those who aren't so hot can get very lucky. Therefore, it's kind of like a slot machine at a casino if you get a group of competent gamers playing each other, i.e. it boils down to a gambling, uncontrolled game of sorts.

Like many, this was my introduction to modern board games.  I was immediately captivated by this fascinating creation.  It's strategic, but it has random dice rolling!  It's competitive but there's no player elimination!  You'll likely get stomped your first game, but once you have the basics down, most games come down to a close finish.  

My wife and I soon bought our own copy and played and played, and introduced it to new people.  After a while, and a lot of plays, the game started to irk me more and more.  I disliked getting screwed over by a string of streaky dice rolls.  I disliked everyone ganging up on one player with the robber.  I disliked that the five resources were not evenly balanced.  I disliked other players making suboptimal trades with each other.  I started to discover other, newer (clearly better! lol) games, and began to turn up my nose at lowly Catan.

I've since come back around.  There are other better gateway games that have come along (e.g. Ticket to Ride, Splendor, Dominion).  There are other games I'd rather play on most any given game night.  But I enjoy it for what it is:  a solid light-middleweight euro that's fun to dust off every once in a while.  It's not the be all end all of strategy games.  But even in spite of its unprecedented success, it has a unique mix of mechanics, strategy and interaction that has never been duplicated.

RATING: 6
Very fun, good balance of strategy (in placement and diplomacy) and luck (sometimes good/bad dice can make/break a game)  A regular in my group.

edit: after many plays this one comes out rarely - but when it does it it still good fun.  Considered something of a beer and pretzels game for my group now more than the creme de la creme 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A classic game, but one that wears out its welcome as soon as you realize how chance-driven it is. Ostensibly you can play the probability game and do fine, settling on the more likely numbers and diversifying a bit, but in actuality it is quite easy to get off to a bad start and then be blocked off (especially with 4 players).

My #2 all time favorite game.  I love this so much that there was little hesitation to purchase the 10th Annivsary chest.  Expansions are good, but I've come full circile back to playing the base game.  Truely the essnce of gaming.

RATING: 9
Based on countless plays.  I've played Settlers dozens of times and converted around twenty individuals to German-gaming with it.  The simple framework of rules allows a surprising depth of strategic potential which still surprises me every time I play it.  Some complain about the luck of the dice, which is a legitimate criticism.  But we use a deck of dice cards and have had no problems with errant laws of probability since.

Why haven't I been playing Catan for years now?! This was the third modern board game I ever played and it's still just as much fun.

Jogo, extremamente viciante e aleatório, sendo que uma partida dificilmente será igual a outra. Um jogo que você não irá jogar uma só vez. Apesar de haver algumas regras, rapidamente os iniciantes pegam a mecânica do jogo, e não raro um iniciante ganha de pessoas mais experientes. O jogo conta com a sorte dos dados, sendo imprescindível escolher os terrenos com alta probabilidade de sair no dado (6 e 8), além de ser importante ter terrenos com minérios e trigo, estratégia mais comuns nos jogadores mais experientes...

Ah, the literal gateway game. Nobody needs my opinion, because everyone's heard of and played Catan. 

Honestly, I played approximately 300 games in high school and early college to great success, back when I didn't know much about board games, but now you'd have to really convince me (or butter me up with some great snacks) to get me back to the table for this one. This game is a combination of infuriating bad luck, backstabbing "friends", and someone being a poor sport by the end, which is really not my cup of tea. I did recently play with a bunch of expansions and houserules a friend had mashed up, which made the game more interesting and complicated, but also incredibly long and needlessly complex, so I'm not sure that was actually a net win. 

I will fully admit that this game singlehandedly created a generation of board gamers (including myself), who would never have moved on from Scrabble and Monopoly if it weren't for Catan, and it's honestly not a bad game, it just really doesn't live up to the hype now that I have games in my collection much better suited for my personality and life. It should be noted, however, that I am just not a fan of competitive games by and large, so that's a major reason this game hasn't withstood the test of time for me.

I did not enjoy my first game of this as i set up in completely the wrong locations and 8 was never rolled. Most frustrating. I'd give it another go then maybe revise my rating. Not as great as I expected it to be though given its gateway game status. Though the people we played with owned the game as their only designer board game so I got to take round my collection and now they love games too. So all in all a good result.

If you've only played Monopoly before, you'll probably like Settlers.  If you've played good boardgames, you don't need this.

- REALLY important that you're good at rolling dice in this game.

- The first 2 moves you make account for like 70% of your success

- Unnecessary, annoying action cards

Looking forward to many more times of play with my students!

This game deserves its reputation.  Everyone with whom I have played this game has really enjoyed it.  The trading portion of this game really brings up the social interaction, as well as providing a mechanism to keep the leader from pulling too far ahead.

I bumped this down in score because the Cities & Knights expansion makes this even better, so it couldn't be a 10 by itself, right?

堅実なゲーム。いくつか点数の取り方があり、運もあり、交渉もあり・・・でも、それに慣れるまで時間がかかる。まだ回数を重ねていないので、毎回何かのルールを間違える。たとえば、街を建てる場所、７の処理のカード上限。堅実なゲームであるので、ルール間違えがあると自分の中では、失敗と思ってしまう。統計データで、プレイの難易度も2.4もある。やはり、初心者にはルールが多い。
もう一つ、やはりダイスの運に泣かされるのがキライ。上級者は最初の段階で最適な場所とりが完了しているので、面白いかもしれないが、初心者はそれも良くわからない。上級者は、最初の陣地とりが頭を使う・・・というが、言い換えれば、この陣地とりで決まり、あとはおまけ？なのだろうか、と思ってしまう。

A classic.  Great every time I play.  Good balance of strategy, planning and luck.  Changing board makes this game a 10. 

Edit: I've played this game more times than any other in my collection. I've reduced it to an 8 simply because I don't want to play it much. It's still a great game, but not my first choice.  It hits the table a lot though because everyone else, including my wife, loves it.

It's too easy to find yourself with nothing you can do over several turns due to dice rolls not going your way. This can be a problem with any dice dependent game, but Catan can last a long time and spending several turns with nothing you can do is both frustrating and boring.

RATING: 4
This game deserves the accolades it gets; it probably opened the North American doors to German/Eurogames and I'm very thankful for that. I like a lot about the game - it's essentially a multiplayer solitaire (which I tend to like), has an interesting theme, and most people I've played it with really enjoy it. It's also quick to learn - the basegame seems to play best with 3.

The trading portion of a player's turn, however, is poorly designed; it greatly increases gametime and creates some confusion for the very small price of increasing interaction. This tone, indeed, has created some spillover problems for games of Settlers I've played - I've played with players who have used their knowledge of what other players want to affect drawing cards from other players during the Robber phase.

Also, be wary if you plan on buying this: there's about 20 different expansions for it (5-6 player expansion, Seafarers of Catan, Seafarers of Catan 5-6 player expansion, which is different, Knights of Catan, Knights of Catan 5-6 players ... )  so you could really be dropping a lot of money before you're done.

Igazi klasszikus.
A Catan esetében a szabályok elsajátítására, tanulmányozására nem kell napokat áldozni az életünkből. De még órákat sem. Ez nem jelenti, hogy nem lehetnek vitás kérdések. :D Elég könnyen átlátható akár már első próbálkozásra. Lássuk be, rendkívül nagy a szerencse szerepe ebben a játékban is. Hiába próbálunk úgy helyezkedni, hogy a könnyebben kidobható számokat tartalmazó mezőkkel érintkezzen a településünk, városunk, ha utána mégis ritkán jönnek elő azok a számok. Szerencsére azért ez nem egy felturbózott szerencsejáték csupán. A kereskedéssel meg kell próbálni a céljaink eléréséhez nélkülözhetetlen nyersanyagok beszerzését. Ez jó kis interakciót biztosít a játékostársak között. A győzelemhez szükséges 10 pontot meg egyáltalán nem olyan könnyű elérni.
Az tetszik a Catanban, hogy ha egy család úgy dönt, hogy csak az alapjátékot veszi meg, akkor is rengetegszer újra játszható a társas, mert a területlapkák elhelyezése szabadon variálható, meg persze az azokon szereplő számok is. Ez is olyan játék, ahol több úton is el lehet jutni a győzelemhez. Van, aki csak a települések, városok építésére áll rá, van aki a fejlesztési kártyákat gyűjti, van, aki mindenféleképpen birtokolni szeretné a leghosszabb út címét, stb. Ráadásul nagyon hangulatosak az illusztrációk. Nekünk már a műanyag figurás változat van meg, de nem érzem gagyinak ezt sem. Biztosan más érzés fabábukkal játszani, de nekem ezzel sincs gondom, itt legalább részletesebb egy-egy elem kidolgozása.
Azért 4 fővel ez sem a legrövidebb játék, mind a két menet kb. másfél óra volt.
Egyébként az, hogy minden egyes dobásnál figyelsz, hogy kapsz-e nyersanyagot, minimálisra csökkenti az üresjáratot két köröd között. Persze előfordulnak olyan szerencsétlen szériák, hogy akár két teljes kör is végig megy, te meg csak ülsz és szomorúan nézed az egy szál erőforrásodat a kezedben, ami sehogyan sem képes az osztódással szaporodásra.

Solid game. I like it. One problem, though, is that one player always seems to get left behind in the dust with no way to catch up. And the player who does a little bit well in the beginning gets robbed the hell out of, which annoys me.  You might think two wrongs make a right, but no.

First non-Monopoly-type board game I played and I liked it at the time. The more other games I play the more I see it as a good gateway game but a game with some pretty unbalanced flaws that can make or break it. Once you branch out, there are much better games that scratch the same itch. A decent game to get your feet wet before moving onto other things.

12/04 (This is my initial review, which differs greatly from my new review below.  Just goes to show how group morale plays in a gaming experience)

Eh? That was it...how boring.  I thought this game was going to be AMAZING. Maybe it's the fact that the 4 players wanted to keep turning their head to America's Funniest Home Videos playing in the background.

Regardless: roll the dice (hope it's yours), collect resource, trade, build.  Repeate ad nauseaum.

This was not my first "German" game, but I have to say the lack of conflict (long time Magic:TG player) bored me.  I hated the 2-player Settlers card game as well.  Perhaps I would appreciate Teuber's Lowenherz/Domaine more.

I'm going to keep this I guess just to have, but I will probably sell the 2 expansions I bought for it.  I know the Cities & Knights expansion adds more conflict, but why bother when there are so many other games that do it without expansion.
=====================================================
12/7/06 (this is an updated review of the game, my previous experience with Settlers was dreadful.  I 
knew my first try didn't fairly give the game a chance and requested to play it again 2 years later)

Finally got a chance to play a real game of Settlers and I enjoyed it.  There are multiple strategies to win (do you keep getting Production cards getting random VPs or perhaps the largest army having control over the robber and shutting down your opponents supply, or try to have the largest civilization netting you more supply, maybe picking up the longest road along the way).

We had a fun time with trade too, but if you're in short supply of a particular resource and people see you're winning, expect to have a trade embargo put on you (unless they're just that desparate).  That was my only negative experience in the game, because I had a boring 3 rounds where no one would help me and I had to do some inefficient trades with my port and watch them all catch up, and suddenly they were all against each other since I wasn't king of the hill anymore.

As the board fills up, lessening available real estate, trade becomes increasingly dominant as people compete for resources to upgrade settlements to cities.  Have you positioned yourself to control that supply?  Or did you choose another path to victory, silently waiting to reveal your Production Cards for VPs?  Are you shutting down that supply with your soldiers?  Is someone trying to steal "Longest Road" from you, racing you or trying to cut yours off?  This kind of nail-biting tension occurs at the end.

When I was finished playing, I was still thinking about the game and what I could have done better.

A modern classic, involving planning, negotiation, and a bit of chance. I'm not really fond of the trading aspect, but as long as you're not playing with people who constantly try to cajole you into making unfavorable trades, or people who just make any trade they're offered to be nice, it works fine in Settlers.

Expansions add flavor but also length. Usually not a worthwhile trade-off for my tastes. If you fall behind in the base game, the end is not so far away, if you fall behind when using expansions, a significant portion of your life passes while you wait for the end.

The seminal German game.  I prefer the standard game for 3-4 players.  

I have two copies:  

The older wooden set is expanded with Seefahrers and the 5&6 players' extensions.  

The 10th anniversary set with plastic pieces is ideal for a simple 10pt, 4-player game.

I first played this in a drunken stupor after a well-done-party for the arrangers of a convention back in '95 or so. Don't remember how it went, but I suppose my tactical abilities were slightly impaired (i.e. I'd been flipped to my disrupted side).

Actually, I feel that the basic Settlers game is slightly dull; get the Seafarers expansion right away! Scenarios & exploration goodness galore.

I've a soft spot for the trading in Catan as its likely borrowed partially from the original Avalon Hill Civilization game I played so much of as a kid.  The die rolling is annoying in this one but easily fixed with the event card deck which replaces the dice entirely and I always tried to play it that way.  I also preferred the game with the first expansion.  Everyone I had known was totally played out on the game so I never played it as much as others have.  I agree nowadays there is just no shortage of better gateway games that likely are more appealing because of better theme integration if nothing else. Ad Astra replaced this game for me for awhile but got bored with that one quick.

I got a lot of enjoyment out of Settlers, and occasionally still do with online play. It just doesn't grab me much now. I've long thought that its mechanics of balancing cooperation with competition worked brilliantly, a very different kind of game from AmeriTrash's straight competition. But in repeated playing, games always reached a tipping point where there was no more trading, no more interaction, and it was a straight competition to get to the finish. Perhaps that's how it was designed to be. But it just doesn't leave enough variation to the pattern of the game. Eventually, I was willing to part with Settlers, knowing that it would not be hard to re-acquire if I wished to, in order to make room for something else in my collection.

CRITIQUE OF SETTLERS OF CATAN
Settlers of Catan is a mixed bag for me. I appreciate many aspects of the game: the variable setup of the board, the trading (a Euro game with interaction!), the different paths to victory, the short playing time. But on the other hand there are many things the game could do better.

The trading in Settlers has none of the fun of the trading in a game like Bohnanza, where you actually have to trade in order to do what you want. In Settlers, trading is entirely optional, and very often frustrating with less experienced players. It's annoying to watch the player in last place trade freely with the leader, giving them exactly what they need to win. In my opinion, the most important use of trading is as a catch-up mechanic, but everyone has to be on board, understand what's going on, and trade strategically for the purpose of keeping the game close. Unfortunately, this sours the game's main interactive element, making it feel very much like "bash the leader" style play.

The Robber is the same, and the use of the robber also increases the boredom factor by slowing the flow of resources in the game.

I do like the conversion of resources into roads, settlements, or cards, but the flow of these resources is based on a roll of the dice, which make it all too easy in Settlers to have a turn in which you can do nothing. For me, this is a BIG negative, because doing nothing is not fun. Furthermore, the imbalance in the relative value of the resources undermines the "multiple paths to victory" aspect of the game.

The decisions in Settlers are fairly interesting, and give the game another way for players to interact (by means of the area control aspect of the game). Unfortunately, every interaction is just a variation on the theme of "blocking." And the fact that your network of roads and settlements is developed so slowly means that there is little recourse for a blocked player. Unlike worker placement games, in which blocking only works for a single turn, blocking in Settlers is often permanent.

None of this prevents the game from being fun, but it does make it less fun than other games I own. Finally, there is the production value of the game: Settlers has sub-par components. Mayfair should be embarrassed to put out a groundbreaking game like this with such shoddy bits. I could list all the defects, but honestly only the rulebook seems like a quality product. Aesthetically the game could have been much better done.

I ended up giving away my copy of Settlers, which I had never had the urge to get to the table. I've played the game several times, with experienced players, but just never enjoyed it as much as I enjoy other games.

I gave this as a gift and it sat unplayed for about eight years. After that I read the rules and vowed to play. About a month after that, I found my own copy at Goodwill and actually played and could kick myself for not playing sooner.

What this game really did for me was become a gateway game for my wife and another couple. When I was with the three of them, we usually just played cards or dominoes.

This truly opened up the horizon for them and since then, I have introduced many more games that went over really well. I now have two "groups" of players which means games come out that much more frequently.

Klassiker. Interaktivitet mellom turane i form av byttehandel. Etter min smak ikkje djupt nok (fins berre ca 3 slags strategiar), for langt (90 min) og for mykje flaks (70%). Viktig spel i brettspelhistorien, men ikkje så interessant lenger.

I have been playing euro games and war games and the like for years now and last night was my first time playing catan and I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the random dice mechanic would make it hard to play (I played Spacefarers of catan and did not like it at all). I can see why this is such a great gateway game and I should get a copy just for that reason.

While not my favourite trading game, I like Settlers. It's easy to teach and fast to play, making it a solid introduction to the hobby (though you probably knew that). Luck in the dice rolls can have a big impact, though it is sort of balanced with the thief, which acts as a "bash the leader" mechanism. 

Its luck factor gives the impression to have a larger impact than the one it actually has. This is both good and bad: good because it means skill is still important, bad because even though it can be mitigated, some players will simply refuse to play, arguing it's completely luck driven.

Catan,the most popular board game on the planet. A great gateway game. It's a bit too simplistic in its original version but the expansions help a lot in improving game-play and replay value. The mechanic is ingenious and provides a good mix of strategy and luck so that anyone can have a shot at winning. It lends itself to a very wide audience, of all ages.

RATING: 9
I feel like this one is a gold standard.  It's deep enough for repeated play by serious gamers while easy enough to be enjoyed by newcomers and casual gamers.  It's shocking to me that it isn't rated higher.  Maybe there's a bias against it because it's popular and you can buy it at some mainstream stores.  

I was kind of against Catan myself before I played it.  It's hard to get excited about an agriculture based game.  It seems like the most boring thing you could spend an hour involved with. However, first appearances can be deceiving.  Catan is super well balanced, each game is different and there are multiple strategies to winning.  I would be embarrassed if I didn't have this in my collection.

Just a classic, people in my board game group will always want to play this if someone mentions it.

Update 12/30/14: I've now played this game for what feels like 50 times. I really enjoyed it at first, but now I'm sick of it. I've lowered its rating due to its dullness now (the C&K expansion actually has a higher rating from myself). It still has a special place in my heart though.

This is the game that got me into the hobby, as seems to be the case for a lot of people on BGG. It also appears that many have abandoned the game as too "random." I've toyed with posting a defense of Catan in the forums, but I think there are several threads already discussing that. In short, the strategy is certainly obscured somewhat by the dice rolling mechanic, but to argue the game is random or luck based is far from the truth. After countless plays both in person and on XBox Live, I argue that the number of games that are severely tainted by absurd dice rolling statistics are fairly rare. Much more often, mistakes in judgement, or strokes of genius drive the outcome. Most importantly, getting the final 1-3 points often feels like a rewarding puzzle. Throw in that there is usually at least one other person vying for those points, and you have a quite satisfying climax.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really simple and yet enjoyable game. Everyone starts with placing two villages on the board. These villages share borders with tiles of grain, wool and other raw materials. To get something from these tiles, you have to throw the numbers on these tiles with two dices. A little bit of luck is required. However, some numbers are more commonly thrown with two dices (6, 7, 8) then others (2 or 12), so the locations of your starting villages are important. You can use the raw materials to expand your two starting villages into a large network of villages and cities (which get you even more raw materials). Main goal is to first get to ten points (villages are 1 point, cities are worth 2).

RATING: 6
I have never seen the appeal of Settlers as a gateway game.  My non-gamer friends and family were bored by it.  I don't mind dice-rolling but the mindless monotony of rolling for resources stupefies me.  The trading aspect can be fun, though with a little experience players know what not to trade.  My kids do enjoy picking the card out of an opponents hand when they play the thief.  This game is especially unpleasant on BSW.   

My ten-year-old son loves the game however.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Catan:[/b][/size]
- I dislike the route/network building mechanic in this game.
- The game lacks meaningful decisions because there is no way to mitigate bad dice rolls and the choices to make are often obvious.
- At least one player is often left with the worst possible starting position and is hence bound to lose.

Update: Not current favourite anymore, this is one game that's seriously starting to lose it's shine. Even seafarers doesn't help. I think historical scenarios are the best thing Catan has to offer. It seems the game has too much luck and takes too long for what it offers. Well, it still gets plays now and then, but not on a regular basis. (Old rant: Current favourite, usually played with Seafarers. There's luck, there's strategy, and it's not too long. What's not to like?)

This was the game that got me into board gaming almost three years ago. It doesn't come off of the shelf often simply because of the play time. The number of hours it takes varies heavily by who you play it with (if drinking is involved, you're gonna be there for a while...) and if you dare to go all the way up to the 6-player count. Regardless, it's still a fun game, but at least for me I think it's fine as is and I probably won't expand.

I once liked this, but I just find it so boring in-between rounds, finally getting to roll the dice, and then you roll something that is of no use to you at all. And this happens over and over again. I win more than my fair share of Catan games, but I rarely have fun until the very end. It's just not worth it when so many other games you have fun throughout.

Catan is one of the most common gateway games for a reason. It is fairly simple to teach and learn and still offers more strategies and player interaction than many "mainstream" games.

Greatest advantages are: the board every time is different; the proportional quick contest; easy rules.

In spite the pretty big chance variation really draw in, I use to the retraction other into the addiction board games.

I enjoy this, if mainly for the fact that it's easy to play with friends. My issue is, I suppose, that by game end everyone has 8 or 9 VPs, and everyone is just waiting for the right die rolls to get the exact resource they need to build the next city and gain the final VP. 

New players can quickly compete with "veterans", which is both good and bad. On one hand, new players aren't left with nothing to do, nor frustrated by inexperience. On the other, there's not enough left to learn or improve, so each game plays very similarly.

RATING: 6
4 players. Some people refer to this as monopoly with sheep which is unfair. It can be very frustrating  when your resources don't come up for ages but the dice roll tends to balance out over time. Unfortunately if you put your initial settlements in bad locations it's very difficult to win. 2 hour games can be optimistic! Advantage of this game is the rules are easy to grasp.

I prefer using the dice cards to ensure 'fair' randomness and for the extra bonuses that can help all players and hinder the leader.

Originally my wife's game, I have struggled to succeed with or love Catan. The two are probably related. Likely due to playing with experience Catan veterans, I've never really felt like I am able to be competitive in this game or make good choices about where and how to build. I respect this game, I want to like it more, but I'm a little bitter.

RATING: 5
Okay so I finally played it. 2010-10-09

Against AI mind you. I can't allways play poker for money...

After 280 ratings I can add Catan to my lists of ratings and it is a rock solid 7. 

I know why some of you love it. The game offers great tension and plenty of choices. Part of it strength is also the reason why I can't rate it higher is that in the dutch rules you have to throw the dice at the start of your turn.
I started by saying that I won 2/3 games. The game I lost I had won if I didn't throw a 7... I had all the resources to upgrade. Stil had a chance if I drew the right card but didn't do so.
Obviously that adds to the fun . It's fine if I can play the game in 60 minutes. I will upgrade the rating to an 8 then.
By the looks of it my group will take close to two hours to finish the game. To be able to lose a game when you are five  to one favourite before YOU yourself roll the dice, anything but a seven, well that can be tough.

This probably won't ever be a personal favourite of mine but i have to say that I wouldn't have thought that a game with such a small ruleset  has so much replay potential.

If one player doesn't understand the trades and  or trades favorable towards on player the game is broken. 
If everyone plays it right and quick this is definately fun. I've played games I liked much more but this one is for the masses and I liked it.

Update : Essen thursday 2010 RATING 7=>5
Played it with the group at Karl's place. Karl,alain, gust. All were new to it and they didn't think much of the game. General feeling was that if the rolls are in your favour you do well. and if you are the first person to take the lead it will be hard to win.

I am so glad this game exists.  Fun.  It's for the random folks who game.  Playable with folks who want to be gamers, but really like a bit more light fare.  The dice are the deciding factor.  I sware.. put everything on 9, it's better than 6/8 in our games :).  It reminds me of gambling a lot.  Hard if there is someone who gets seriously.. painfully beaten each time because the dot discussion on probabilities is a bit too much for them.  So.. in a certain group, it's great.  I still love it for certain groups.

Me and my wife's first game of this style and we like it a lot.  Its very easy for new people and younger players to learn, we play with our 10 year old boy all the time.  My initial excitement with the game has diminished the more we've played as luck just seems to play too big a part some games.
Update: Bumped the rating up to 8 after a very enjoyable 4 player game with my wife and 2 of my kids.  Luck still plays a big part but you can make the luck work for you by choosing the numbers that are rolled most and putting your settlements on as many numbers as possible.

I wouldn't play this outside of a "gateway" situation. Also, I wouldn't play it without friends I'm comfortable talking shit too because sometimes the right answer to a trade request is "no" and sometimes the right answer is "fuck you".

Can't rate a game higher if all that matters is just a dice roll :/ 

Many might say "more stuff matters than dice roll". OK, agreed, it matters where you place your stuff, according to what is the probability of the dice roll. Some trading element is there too. But if you roll your dice badly - there's nothing to trade :)

Place all your stuff around 7 and 8. Unless there's a robber around. Then place elsewhere. Generally it doesn't matter, it's random anyway

OK, I know this game is loved around the world by dozens of people, but [i]I just don't like it.[/i]  I don't know why.  I'll play it if I have to, but for hex-based games where you don't get to run over anybody with a tank, I prefer Samurai.

A truly awful game.  Mechanically, it is clunky and poorly designed, and thematically, it is fairly uninteresting.  I really don't know how it ever became popular.  A good marketing campaign, I suppose.

Settlers is a good dipstick, though, for testing how experienced of a gamer a person is.  Do they own or enjoy Settlers of Catan?  Then they're inexperienced, and it is your responsibility to introduce them to legitimately good board games.

RATING: 5
Played this plenty of times but overall I'm not a big fan.  When I win I usually just feel like it is because of the dice.  The biggest decision you have to make is at the beginning of the game with your initial placements and all of the decisions after that seem increasingly trivial.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I thought that I would love this game more, but it didn't really move me.  But objectively it is an excellent design.  My main design criticism is that I feel that whoever begins the game with the best board position has a big advantage, to the extent that he or she will probably win.  Strategy helps somewhat, but only somewhat.  You also can't gang up on the leader as effectively as in some other games.  Regardless, this game seems destined to become a classic.

The key skill in Catan is persuading people to gang up on other players while you're actually doing best and I really don't enjoy that kind of manipulation.

I love settlers of Catan. My goal is always to get one of each number, because then I get something EVERY turn except a robber turn.

Enjoyable to most people, everyone should own this game.

I've grown a bit tired of this game even though I haven't played it hundreds of times like some.  While I generally do pretty well in the game (hurray for trading games!), I don't like seeing people get boxed in early and/or incidentally robber-blocked to the point where they have little chance of remaining competitive.  While I don't mind losing too much myself, I'd rather that everyone feel like they're still in the game, rather than just taking turns while hoping someone else will win, so the game can end.

Strangely enough, I purchased Seafarers of Catan despite these sentiments.  Of course, I've heard that Seafarers does balance out a few resource issues, so maybe all hope is not lost.

I'm not a big fan of Klaus Teuber's games and Settlers of Catan IS conventional game from Teuber. Nice idea that everytime the gameboard is different so the game is a little bit different too. But when the game starts: it's dice rolling, dice rolling… and guess what: dice rolling! If you don't get right numbers, then you'll loose. If you don't get a good start, you'll loose. Who gets the money, gets more money => rich comes richer. That is a feature which is distinguish of Teubers' games. I'm ready to play Settlers of Catan if someone wants to but it's not my favorite game.

RATING: 5
The new modern classic board game of our time and in that sense heir to [b]Monopoly[/b], considering [b]Catan's[/b] [i][b]huge[/b][/i] worldwide impact (which also lead to an insane amount of spin-offs, expansions and re-themes).

Still a good gateway game for absolute newcomers, although like [b]Monopoly[/b], it did not age very well ([b]Settlers of Catan[/b] is from 1995 and it simply can not compete with more modern games).

Back in 1995, this was a 10 for most people (including myself), which makes sense, as it marks a turning point for the board game hobby and will always be a milestone in the history of board games.

The first expansion ([b][thing=325][/thing][/b]) is great (and in my opinion even essential), while the other expansions did not do so well for me, as it always felt to me that the designers forcefully tried to transform the game into something more complex, which this game simply is not meant to be -- but I see that it made sense back then to keep the fans busy and make [i]a few[/i] $$.

It's "cool to hate" [b]Catan[/b] among avid board gamers nowadays, but what they often actually mean is that they burnt out on it and that it did not age well.

If you are reading this as a complete newcomber to the board game hobby: go ahead and give it a try, but make sure it's not the only game you will be playing.

Best played with 3 or 4 players (i.e., without the 5-6 player expansions), Settlers of Catan is a game that all gamers should have in their collection. The mechanics are easy to learn and the "in game" trading allows for interesting player-to-player social interactions. Although tha game is described as a 90-minute game, you may want to allocate a bit more time for it.

Actually I really love this game in spite of the luck factor (that is why only the 8 - would have given it a 9 or 10). There are so many variants for this game out there. I think it&#039;s the new &quot;Monopoly&quot;-game for the family - easy to learn and fun to play (over and over again). The other thing which is cool about the game is the trading. When you trade with a player you help yourself but also that player.

Got this, then gave it away in frustration. I think everything about this game is so smart, but there is just too much luck involved for how long it takes. I can take some luck in a short game, but when you're over the hour mark and YOU CAN'T EVER GET A DICE ROLL TO GO YOUR WAY... I rarely get frustrated playing games, but one time I was covering every number except 2, 3 & 11, and the ONLY numbers that would appear were these three or the number where the thief was hanging out on my land. Which was right after a game where a similar scenario had occurred. Late in this game, I rolled the number where the thief was hanging out - which happened to be the sixth straight turn where I received NOTHING - so picked up the board, dumped everything on it into the box and handed it to one of the other players, telling them to never bring it into my house again. 

Trading is also a game mechanic I'm rarely in love with, especially when it can go on and on AND ON. And it does here. Even with limiting the number of trades a person can ask for, this game can still drag out. I have no idea why this game is so popular. Friends are not even allowed to mention it in my presence!

Use to teach newbies, house rules include not moving robber on 7 roll, but instead choosing a resource of your choice from the supply.  Speeds up play and makes for a friendly game (until knight development cards start being played).

This game is way too much depending on dice luck, whether you will be able to take part in it at all. Needs new mechanics to reduce the watch others spend their resources feeling aka passive waiting for the right number. The City and Knights expansion is better.

RATING: 4
Mechanics work right, and some game can be really enjoyable. My main problem with this game is that in almost every session there is some player crushed by the luck. This could be acceptable (although annoying) for a casual 30 minuts game, but spending 90 minuts in a game when you know since the first half an hour that you don't have any chance is simply excruciating. To make things worse, it suffers from the "rich gets richer" problem. A game to avoid.

RATING: 6
It's a classic simply because of it's gateway status and popularity alone, combining the features of negotiation and building tactics.  Everything about it screams "interaction".  Since I've played this so often over the years, I find I'm more interested in other boardgames but it hits the table for me b/c others play this so much.

Nem rossz játék ez. Kifejezetten egyszerűek a szabályai, van benne egymásra hatás is, halad benne minden játékos a cél felé, bár, igazából nagy szerepe van a szerencsének abban, hogy ki gyűjti össze először a nyeréshez szükséges pontszámot. De ez játék közben nem zavaró.

Ami külön tetszik benne, az a kalóz/útonálló, ezek kicsit színesebbé teszik a játékot, jó ötlet volt őket beleálmodni.

Minu esimene "korralik" lauamäng. Aastatega on mäng minu jaoks väsimust hakanund näitama, aga see ei tähenda, et tegemist oleks kuidagi halva mänguga. Eriti kui oled seda kindlalt 30+ korda mänginud. Kahest eestikeelset laeindist on kindel lemmik meresõitjad. Parimad mängimised ongi olnud siis kui oleme sõpradega võimalikult suure kaardi ehitanud. Linnad ja rüütlid olid ka alguses tore, aga minu meelest muudab see mängu mõtetult keerukaks ilma piisavalt väärtust lisamata.

RATING: 5
Although the game has something, I don't really like to play it. There is just too much luck for my taste. A single roll sometimes makes the difference between a very very usefull turn and one where you can't do anything.
Also getting no ressources multiple times in a row, while most others do just isn't fun.

Used to love this game a lot more than I do now. Gameplay seems now to be largely based around convincing others I'm not in the lead so I can get enough trading, which makes the meta-game more important than the game itself.

Initial impressions after one play:  Nice ideas in this -- variable board, set collection, trading, etc.  But it's just too dice-driven for me.  If you roll badly, you lose.  You can't trade if you don't roll enough of your resources, and anyway, too much of the game is dependent upon initial placement.  Check out Breese's "Keythedral" for a diceless and somewhat heavier treatment of the settlers theme.

It's hard not to agree that this is the perfect gateway game. The rules are understood by new players part way through the game and the trading elements encourage frequent interaction.

My only criticism is that ten points can be a little long some times and that maybe eight or nine points is a better alternative.

One of the classic games of the modern board game era.  You're building settlements and cities, connecting them by roads, in order to gather more resources for more of the same until you have enough points to win.

It's Catan. I don't even know how to rate or comment on it. Like many people it was one of my gateway drugs into the world of 'hey board games aren't as boring as they used to be'. I am pretty tired of it, but it's still an excellent game that's a ton of fun, and it's so easy to just pick up and get started because of the familiarity.

I like the social interaction aspect of this game: not all game have so much social interaction.  Negotiation skills do pay off.  Also, determining what you need, what your strengths/weaknesses are, and what your opponent might provide you with and what they need is quite interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can see why this is regarded as a classic. I liked it very much. The dynamics of the game are fluid and the player interactions are always fun. Playing badly in the early game leaves you so much behind though that you can't challenge other players anymore. While it's fair, it also makes the game a bit boring for the losing player. The game can sometimes drag on a lot though...

This was the game that really hooked me to get back into board games, and I love playing as often as possible. I think the mechanics are simple once you have played the game and seen them in action, as I've taught a number of people to play and they all look lost until about halfway through playing. If you have not tried this game yet, I encourage you to jump in ASAP

RATING: 6.5
A classic game known to many, an unfortunate symbol of geek culture that can turn off many non-gamers. It's a game that's fine, nice mechanics like resource management and trading, multiple avenues to win. But the game is right down to luck: who gets to place their places in the best positions for resources at the very start, what dice rolls happen and who gets those resources, and who gets robbed the most etc. This means the strategy is almost not there, but it's easy to get into, and it's not going to actively turn away people like a long game of Monopoly or Munchkin does. Perfectly fine gateway that I'll play whenever, but I just don't care enough to win since there's not that much you can do to control it.

I first played this game online with a bunch of dutch friends around 6 years ago. I was rather hooked at first, but it wasn't until much later that I would try out the actual board version.

Most often it works though..

RATING: 9
'Settlers' is a fantastic family game. Great for those occasions when you want to host a game that isn't focused on warfare. It really gets people interacting in a big way. Good or bad things can happen to you at any time, even on other players turns. The 5-6 player extensions are great, because they modify the gameplay further, allowing each player the chance to conduct some activity for themselves, on other players turns. It's definately not a game where you get bored waiting for your next turn to roll around. The rules are simple to pick up, and yet the game has tremendous potential for modification or adapting 'house rules'.

Still, it's something everyone should play, at least once, if only because so many other games build off some of the concepts in Settlers.

This is THE game. Any player needs to have played this game. My complaints are numerous. First the board is horrible as are the cards, the artwork was dated in 1976 and the rules could use some variants. The expansions are a joke in that they DON'T REQUIRE CATAN TO PLAY. I want a real expansion, new resources, new cards, co-op play. I've seen Catan expansions with the last one, but this game is a play for awhile, keep on the back burner for newer players and pull this out every once in awhile for some epic (albeit old-school) gaming.

It's a great game, I've played it more times that any games I own (except Risk). My friends seem to love Eurogames more than I do, aince their first plays of this, they have bought Mexica and Carcassone. I am planning to buy El Grande, Blue Moon City, Puerto Rico and Die Macher... I dont like Euros that much, I just want to spend more quality time playing...

It has lost some of its coolness over the plays, I'll start to bring more games to the table and then return to this.

Edit: As you see I have bought lots of other games. 

Edit: Down to 7, played it again while teaching my friend's girlfriend how to play: It just ain't worth it without C&K.

[Mostly played with: 3]

Edit: I've found why I didn't liked the original game that much, most of the times I played with 3 and this should be played with 4.

This is hands down the best board game ever created! Every play is different!  There are different strategies and different variations to try to change it up a bit.  I'm always up for a game of settlers!  You must get the 5-6 player expansion too though so that you have the opportunity to play with a more varied number of friends/family.

This was described to me as the German Monopoly which got my interest as I consider Monopoly to be the greatest game EVER so I was really disappointed to find out this has NOTHING to do with Monopoly. I mean where are the deeds? Where is Free Parking? Instead I got some board that CHANGES every game? How can I base a strategy on that? Trading stuff between players is a little too hippy touchy-feelie for me so I refused to trade throughout the game and came in last place. Total waste of time.

Classic game I was addicted to years ago, have a case with most expansions. We play it less now, mostly when we are not in the mood to use our brain too much ! This is a game you can introduce to very casual players who might grow more interest further into board gaming while still having a great time.

Like most other people, Settlers was one of the first Euros I played and it helped start me on the hobby. I can't add anything to the praise it has received. The design is inspired and clever all at the same time.

That said, I find myself not really wanting to play much any more, especially with four players. Part of this is due to luck as some games the rolls just don't go your way. Another part is the downtime. I find myself spacing off during other players turns. Most players I know are unwilling to trade because they are worried about helping you too much. Further, I try to not plan ahead too much as things can change a lot before the dice come back to you (roads block you, solider/robber steals cards, etc.). 

A biggest part, however, is the endgame. Just when it looks like someone will win, another player bashes them and further delays the game. I usually don't mind "beat up on the leader" as this is an important strategy for winning. For Settlers, however, it makes what should be a 30 minute game into one that is 60 hour or longer.

As such, it is the best game that I rarely have any desire to play. 

Note: online play against AI helps as it speeds things up considerably. I recommend, http://games.asobrain.com

Kept for nostalgia value and as a gateway game.

We have not yet played this with three or four players yet, so I can't give it a fair rating.  We tried many of the two player variants found here, but none of them really worked for us.  Probably the most fun part, the trading, was virtually non-existent.  As a result, the game became a basic resource/building game without too many frills.  However, there was a significant runaway leader "rich gets richer" problem---the first person to get a city saw their resources start to take off well beyond the other player.  There were few ways for the second player to come back.  There were a few games where the robber was parked solely on the losing player's side for most of the game.  As a result, this left a bad taste and drove us away from all things Catan for a long time (which we regretted since there [i]are[/i] some quite good two player Catan games).

To be fair, [GAMEID=13] looks like it would be a lot of fun with more people, but with just two there are much better games.

RATING: 4
I like that this game got a lot of non-gamers into real boardgames.  I consider this the first "real" boardgame I ever played (meaning, Monopoly and Checkers and such aren't real).  I like that it's innovative and original.  But now I don't play it anymore and I'll tell you why.

The biggest thing is that it's too random, luck-based, for how long it is.  I'm fine with randomness in a short game, but once you start adding expansions (and the game is too boring without them), the games can take 3-5 hours if you include setup and teardown.  That's way too much of a time investment considering how swingy the dice can be.

Now I will play this game occasionally with the cards that replace the dice (they come in the Traders and Barbarians expansion).  That system is absolutely great.  It keeps the same probabilities of rolls coming up, but it ensures that each die roll (5's, for instance) will actually come up a certain number of times, but without guaranteeing exactly how many times it will come up.  Brilliant.

But those cards have events on them which only exacerbate another problem the game has: the catch-up mechanisms.  There are waaaaay too many of them when you play with the cards and you have the fish (which involves the boot) and you're playing Cities and Knights (the 3 stacks of development cards).  These are my family's favorite things because without them the game doesn't seem meaty enough.  But these 3 elements all have catch-up mechanisms and basically, the best strategy is to not be in first place, be in second, and then as the first place player gets beat down, take his place towards the end of the game.

And like with luck, it's no fun to have a game have a lot of catch-up mechanisms if it's also very long.

In summary, Catan isn't elegant at all.  To play a fun game you need expansions and expansions add complexity and it's not elegant how they interact.  Other games are more meaty to begin with, or have expansions that are more elegant.  

This isn't a great game.  I know some people will say, "well it's a great way to get non-gamers into boardgames.  It's a gateway game."  Again it's too long for how random it is.  If you want the luck and light strategy, get them into Machi Koro, which is a third the timespan so you can play multiple times.  If you want something with better expansions get Alhambra, the Big Box.  Or if you want something that's already well-rounded and can handle large player counts while being very strategic, get 7 Wonders (has expansions) or Between Two Cities (shorter).

We don't need Catan any more.

I respect Catan's legacy, but this game is glorified Monopoly. It's extremely random, slow, harsh, clunky and otherwise everything we shouldn't look for in a modern board game, let alone a gateway game. The dice decide whether or not you get to do anything, and the robber plus various development cards can set you back to square one when you're already behind. 

This is thought of as a great trading game and I simply can't see it. Given how hard it is to come across goods, let alone useful ones in the early game, players are usually incentivized to hoard their goods. And it punishes you for just playing; with bad luck you can go large portions of the game without doing anything. 

It's easy to teach and has nice components, but we should not settle for "It's better than Monopoly" these days.

Personally, I would rate this a 6. However this game is a huge hit with newcomers to Eurogames so I rated it a 7 bearing in mind that it will and always will be the go to game for new players. For me, I find it boring especially when playing against newer players as the downtime can be excrutiating for such little action (roll a dice). I think that's it. It's the downtime that bothers me the most in this game but in all honesty, I find it a little fun when there is minimal downtime.

A top-notch game of building and development.  Of the 20(ish) people I’ve introduced this to, every single one has enjoyed it, and many have become real fans.  I’d suggest playing with resources face up when teaching people, since that will reduce the frustration of learning exactly what you need to build what.  The game is simple, yet it manages to have realistic production, trade, and building.  The ending is usually either very close, or such a blowout that it ends very quickly.

One of my favorite games partly because it is the reason I entered the wonderful world of board gaming, and partly because it is a pretty darned good game. 

I really enjoy the trading part of the game that gives a lot of interaction even without direct conflict. Multiple ways of scoring. 

This was my go to game for introducing players to board gaming. They never really understood how to win the first game but almost everyone wanted to play again. 
Now maybe ticket to ride would be better but that is a bit to easy\limited for me. 

It doesn't get very much play anymore but when we do I always enjoy it. 

Cons
If you are tied down early it can be a boring stretch until finished. 

House rule? If you roll a seven You move the robber. Makes it a lot more fun and do not double punish you for the roll. (Note that we had two different ways of handling the robber in the rules so this might be the original way of using him. If not make it so :)

很想說…卡坦島，不解釋。

經典就是經典，
此遊戲要策略有策略（擺放地盤是策略），
要彼此攻訐有彼此攻訐（資源交換時），
要運氣有運氣（看那美麗的骰子～）。

不過我覺得玩這款遊戲的時候要注意，
因為此遊戲有「策略的成份」，
所以如果你太在意策略，你就會被骰子玩弄，
看那連出的數字2、3，以及連骰3次7的神妙經驗，
我會將卡坦定位在「派對」、「家庭」遊戲的範疇，
這樣就不會動太多的情緒，

First of all, I respect this game for being very good at its role as a gateway game, and see its place. That being said, I think it is overrated. The game drags too much if a clay or wood is in short supply (and if you do happen to get clay or wood, you have an incentive to put the robber on opposing clay/wood tiles, so that other people can't catch up, ,dragging the game on even more). If you get lucky in the beginning with the die rolls you can have a runaway leader problem. Also, while unlikely a player can be so blocked off that they are almost effectively eliminated.

I found there are too much confrontation, ppl can be v. mean to each other :>  
in the game i played, ppl are holding up resources on purpose and revenging each other with the robber.  I mean it maybe strategically correct, but as a gateway game this may put ppl off.  And i don't think this is a good way to make new friends :>

I would much rather use carcassone or tickets to ride as a gateway game

I owned this for a few years but never broke it out because I'd heard and read that 'the only way to play this game is with 4'. Before BGG.

Fooey, the thing works well with 3, no problem. Might require 3 good gamers, though. 4 is good, no question, especially if some of the group are not so great gamers.

My copy is actually missing parts but I have friends who own it as well.  One of the first geekworthy board games I played.  Possibly my gateway game.  I still remember the day the group I was with first played the game and the amazement at the ability to do so many different things.  My only dislike of the base game is that the dice never seem to roll anywhere near the numers you would expect on the average.  Then again dice hate me more often than not.  I've advanced on to the expansions now but the base game still gets alot of credit for bringing me into the hobby.

Was the gateway game that got me into modern gaming.  Nowadays, I'd rather play something else, but I have acknowledge its success.  

However, the two main turnoffs for me are: The randomness can feel punishing, when a good strategy falls flat on its face because no 6s or 8s have been rolled, despite probability, and in my experience, in a 4 player game, 1 player usually spends the game stagnant, unable to really achieve much.  

The second, is that I don't like how critical the starting positioning is.  With experience players, I feel like I can accurately predict who will win 80% of the time based solely on where everyone starts.

I'm a card-carrying Catan hater.  This game is practically built on a foundation of two things I loathe in games: too easy for bad luck to screw you, and too easy for the other players to collude to play kingmaker to screw you with the trading.

It's not the most unimaginably awful thing I've played, those are all in the Sorry/Monopoly/etc. category.  But it is easily my least favorite of all the "modern classics".

What started it all for me in this hobby/addiction.  I will always love this game.  Truly a classic that I will play anytime, anywhere.

In my opinion, this should be #1 in the BGG ratings.  I'm not even sure there would be a BGG, or at least a BGG in its present, popular form, if it weren't for Settlers of Catan.  That it has fallen to the 20s (update - now in the 30s) or so is a travesty and reflects the skew of BGG's ratings to new games.

The dice-rolling/resource mechanic in Settlers was so groundbreaking, probably more than any other mechanic since.  And the mechanic complements the design so seamlessly that it is impossible to think of the game with a better mechanic.  Settlers is a masterpiece of game design.

Best gateway game for eurogames.
I must have played more than 100 times before i got tired of it.
I would rate an 7, but the merit of this game as a gateway for me demands a higher note.

This is probably one of the "classics" of the modern days. The new Monopoly/Risk/Chess for the comming century. It combines a couple of nice gaming ideas, is simple and even is liked by people who don't like boardgames normally. I've had not much persons not liking this game.

The gateway game to Euro games.  Settlers is a classic and good fun but it is a bit too reliant on dice rolling (luck) for me.  There are better games in my collection now for when I want a good Euro.  Still a solid game especially with expansions.

No point in being diplomatic.  No point in trading.  No point in developing a strategy that requires more than what's in your hand.  Too many "no points."  I used to say I'd never play this again, but it is worlds again better with Cities and Knights; I'll play that willingly.

A fun trading and social game as long as players don't start treating turns as though the honor of their ancestors is in jeopardy if they make the wrong choice between two virtually equivalent options.

RATING: 6
Classic - I started my game addiction on this, Dominion, and Munchkin. The game generally plays well. I would usually rather play another game but, unlike Munchkin, there is a lot going on for Catan: Visual interest, variable setup, tactile pieces, and a healthy dose of luck.

It is too random (dice rolls determine everything) to be appreciably strategic, unless you and your opponents are really trading a lot of resources. In my experience, nobody every wanted to trade anything. Everyone has to be willing to take a bad trade and then be "owed one", I think. When resources are flowing freely, the game can be a lot of fun.

Deserves its status as a classic gateway Euro. After playing with a number of first timers, everyone has loved it and wanted to replay. Sometimes the dice will screw you, get over it. The other day I bought 11 development cards over 2 games, earning a total of 9 soldiers. That's why its called luck.

The biggest thing that this classic lacks from its newer brethren is the consolation prize when a player gets nothing from the resource roll (newer games award a gold point; gold can be traded 2-for-1 for any resource and aren't counted for robber purposes in the meantime). This would probably be really good with that added in.

Play with real dice, not a dice deck.

This was the second German game I ever played and loved it.  A great way to learn economics: scarcity of resources.  It has a luck factor which is good for new players.  This is what we use to introduce new players to german games, most who have never played a game like this so much, they buy it.  Still great fun.  Update: now for new people with very little game experience, we use Ticket to Ride as the gateway game, but we still use this game for lots of new people as well.
Updated rating to 7.5.

As with Carcassonne, this one is a great friendly, non-aggressive game that's easy to learn and fun to play.

A ground-breaking game that opened my eyes to the new world of board games.  This game has modular boards, resource trading, resources gathered when it is not your turn.

Perhaps, the first great German game to introduce all other German games.  But then get over it!  It wears worse than Monopoly.  At least, when you've brokered a deal in Monopoly to get a set of properties, you've really done something game altering--more than just managing to score that brick you needed to build a road.  If people will play fast, then Settlers is bearable, but when it bogs down, it really bogs down.  I love luck management as part of a game, but in Settlers rarely do I feel that my choices made more of a difference than how the dice rolled over the course of the game.

We taught nearly everyone we knew in 1998-2002 how to play Settlers and it was always a hit. One set of friends liked it so much, they bought all of the expansions. So I've mostly played the Cities & Knights version, which I think is a must - otherwise Settlers gets a little boring (after you've mastered the gameplay).  I still love a good game of C&K though.

RATING: 9
Great game for non-gamers; refreshing and fun.  I love the variable board and the concept is solid as well.  Lots of dice rolling, but as playing the odds is central to the point of the game instead of a quick fix for a conflict resolution, it does not harm the game at all.

The game that introduced me into designer games. For the majority of my life I thought all that existed for board games was Monopoly and Life.

Oh, Settlers!  People hate on you, because you're not the best at everything.  They say other games are more fulfilling and entail less luck.  They may be right too, but you were my first true gaming love and I don't care how many other people you've seen.

I did not play that game as many time as most people so I am not tired of it but I did not find this game particularly fun, it creates tension or just was not fun because I felt like I was just hoping that my number will be rolled and they were not, and it is not a fast game when you know after 25 minutes that you will not win

I'm guessing this is true for a lot of people, but Catan was what started it all. It was THE game that first got me interested in modern designer boardgames and into this hobby. There were other games that really sealed the deal, but it all started with this one. I hadn't played boardgames for years until this game along. So mad props to it for getting me into the hobby.

That said, it's a good game, but no longer my favorite. We still bust it out every now and then with friends.

RATING: 6

This game is OK fun.  It seems the greatest strategic decision is in the initial placement decision.  There is fun trading, blocking, and taking your chance with the bonus cards.

SoC does feature a good amount of luck.  This can make it fun, as this, the robber, and others unwilling to trade with the leader make it easy for those behind to catch up.  I suppose this makes it accessible.

That much luck-factor for me, lowers the score.  However, I do have fun playing this game despite the luck factor.  It is interactive, goes back and forth quite a bit, and encourages alot of table talk.

I wouldn't want to play this everyday, but it does have a place in the collection as a good gateway or social game.

I find the original really lacking. It needs the cities and knights expansion.

RATING: 5
2001 Yeah, my first german-style-game.  It's fun, it's fast and requires some thinking.  The dice-randomness brings the score down a bit though.  Also, it's a bit too long with 13 points (first player to 10-11 points usually wins) and it's too dificult to catch up with "lucky" players getting ahead.

Excellent gateway game (in fact, it was *my* gateway!) as new folks seem to 'get' the game quickly and really enjoy it. The more I play however I find it a bit too random for the time involved and can be very frustrating in some games with the robber or bad rolls.

A classic, no doubts about it. An elegant design, and a game of great "historical" importance. But nowadays I find it a little bit too luck based for my taste. Good players will usually beat bad players, but if everyone is good there' s really little you can do to offset a streak of bad die rolls: without cards you can do literally nothing, thus you have no control. Despite this, still a very good and fun game, but better designs are now available in its category.

RATING: 5
My last play wasn't as painfull as previous ones, but still not a fan.  
Early luck can, and usually will, decide the whole course of the rest of the game.  If the dice don't like you, you will lose, and have a crappy time to boot - this is an unacceptable feature in my opinion.  It also tends to drag on half an hour longer than anyone's interest in the game.

RATING: 5.8
The first time I played Settlers I was not impressed.  Subsequent plays have only made me dispise this game all the more.  This is a game where the dice rolling does NOT work.  I've had games where I literally did not produce anything for up to 8 rolls in a row.  Too much luck to be enjoyable.

I know, this is supposed to be a great game and probably it is.  However, I did not enjoy the times I played it.  I felt it had too much of a runaway leader problem, one of my pet peeves in game design.  In other words, I felt that it was clear after a few rounds who would win and who would lose and catching up was hard to do.  Maybe one day with the right group I will give it a second look, but there are other games I would rather play.

A clasic and a must have! Great social component combined with strategy. the only flaw i feel is that when someone is behind he usually stays there until the end of the game, very anti-eurogame climax.

Roll-and-move modular board game disguised as a strategy game. What little decision making you have is largely undone by the robber. No need to play again.

This really took me by the throat as of the first time I played it: low luck factor, high on interaction, variable board, strategy ... It has it all! It was also the first of the "new" games I discovered later [I used to be a Risk fan]

RATING: 8
I do love it, and maybe I've just played it a million times (realistically around 100), but it's getting a little formulaic. The Knights expansion helps. Up until about the 50th time when you figure out the "right" way to play, it still is relatively different. I just feel like I've kind of peaked. Still one of my favorite games of all time, and still eminently replayable

Great game but too luck driven!  I'm sure it is better with the expansions.  Much of it is luck of the dice and having your settlement/city in the right spot to get resource cards.  Without these resource cards... you are pretty much toast.  Always a good time to play though!  Just a lot better games out there to play.  Great intro game for starting people into Strategy Board Gaming.

This game introduced our family to this new genre of gaming. I wish I had know about it 5 years ago! Everyone in the family likes this game, but to differing degrees. After a few game sessions my youngest son (currently 15 years old) became extremely frustrated with several series of extremely bad rolls of the dice.  We had read about the variation of using a deck of dice instead, so we tried that.  He has now declared that in the future he will only play Settlers with a deck of dice, thus insuring a uniform probability distribution.

I was really surprised by how little I liked this game - I had really been looking forward to playing it. I've only played once, so perhaps I haven't seen enough of the depth of the game yet.

I found the general theme to be kind of boring - I just couldn't get excited about building the little cities. The downtime was painful - there really wasn't anything to think about when the other players were taking their turns. Mostly, however, the thing I didn't like about the game was how I kept losing cards. Everytime someone rolled a 7, there was a good chance that I would lose 1/2 my cards. In addition, I really don't like games where others can steal my cards, something that follows the rolling of a 7. Finally, I just don't enjoy trading games. I'm not really interested in trying to keep track of everyone's hands so that I can make "shrewd" trades. As a result, I usually come up on the losing side of any trade.

I can see why folks like this game, It's just not a hit with me.

This was my Gateway Game. Played nearly 100 times since 2007 and will still play when asked. Since expanding my horizons, I have a hard time accepting that most of the game you are relying on random outcomes based on your placements, but everyone is in the same boat (albeit with different random outcomes that they want, some are better than others) so it's fine.

Asking for wood never gets old either.

The game is easy to teach and easy to play, I understand how it can be such a good intro game (or even a casual game). 

Expansions are nice as well - I like Cities and Knights and would prefer to play that variant all the time. Unfortunately it is difficult to add these new rules with the people who I play Catan with. 

On a regular night with my group, this game would not come out. On nights where I am around non-gamers or family this is an easy one.

Settlers - as has been well chronicled by many other people - was a bridge game for me - that took me from the world of 'board games' as I knew them (think Monopoly, Scrabble, etc) to the world of modern/Euro type board games as I know them now (think bgg.com). At the time, I was blown away by this game and it made me catch the modern board game bug. I thought the mechanics and strategy were great.  Now, however that I've been exposed to many more (imo better) games, I'm actually not a fan of Settlers.  What I don't like about the game is that you are reliant on the trading aspect of the game for success.  Meaning if your opponents decide not to play nice and trade with you, you are sunk. I also don't love how the robber can freeze your progress of the game, and if others gang up on you your sunk. I don't typically mind the 'screw you' aspect of games, but in this case the robber combined with the trading dependencies make this game flawed for me.

I'm still using it to lure people away from playing only Monopoly and to introduce them to the world of board games.

This is a wonderful board game that can be explained to new players, setup, and played well under 1 1/2 hours. This to me makes it a wonderful experience.

This is one of the best games for non-gamers.

Fun classic game. A little tough to explain at first, but easy to play once you get it. When playing well this can be a great game with lots of planning and player to player trading and bargaining.

2010. Birthday present
- 1st modern game I ever played, was delighted (9)
- after few months: maybe too much luck (down to 8)
- after 10 months: definitely too much luck, idle time between players too long, better with Seafarers and-or T&B expansion (Fishes, Caravans), but still too little strategy. After RFTG, Powergrid, etc. even Alhambra I don't suggest Catan anymore. (down to 7)
- after 1 year: too much luck, I'll play it occasionally with Harbormaster and some other modules from T&B, if someone else demands it (family nongamers etc) (down to 6)
- down to 5, last game I played, I ended 2 VP till victory but could not get it because all dev.cards were sold, could not build new settlement nor city. Just had to sit and wait the game to be over.

This game has enough interaction of players to feel competitive but you wont be at each others throats(usualy).

Have only played this with kids 7-12 and its fun enough with them and probably with adults also.

Even though it's "competitive," you are so focusing on building your town, it also seems more like you're "competing with yourself." Also the trading part seems cooperative.

One of the few games my wife likes (along with Memoir 44).

RATING: 7
I can't help but think that every game of Settlers I play comes down to sheer luck. I know the lands yield based on probability, but constant robbers, getting locked out of trades, and lucky victory point draws make any kind of strategy seem meaningless. To sum it up, it's an hour long experience of what could have been decided by a coin toss.

My feelings of the game aside, this is the one game that all of my non-gamer friends constantly nag me to play. It's an awesome tool to sucker them in to the world of boardgames. And for that, I thank you Settlers of Catan.

For myself and many others, Catan was the 'gateway drug' that got me immersed into the hobby of strategic board games after previously only being exposed to overplayed 'Classics' like Monopoly or Risk, party games like Cranium and Trivial Pursuit, or a couple of complicated war games that took an entire day to play if you were lucky.

Catan (or Settlers of Catan when I first played it) hits a lot of key areas for a great board game - easy to understand and teach rules, excellent replayability with the board being different for each game, relatively short time period with games averaging 45-60 minutes, a variety of potential strategies and paths to victory, a lot of player interaction with trading, and gameplay that typically keeps all players with a shot at victory up to the very end. The only real knock against Catan may be it's theme - which can be a little vague (I guess it's early Medieval settlers on a newly discovered island??) and not necessarily the most appealing - and can feel a little tacked on (there's a reason why there are so many alternative versions of Catan - like Star Trek Catan).  But overall, this is an excellent game board game that is easily accessible to casual board-gamers and is definitely an essential part of any collection.

Adding to its value, there are also a variety of expansions that layer additional elements on top of the basic set.  By far the best expansion is Cities and Knights, which practically transforms Catan to a different game - while maintaining the same core mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I really like the negotiations, and player interaction.  It's one fault in my opinion is how it heavily rewards those who are ahead.  Thus if you get several bad rolls in the beginning, you may just be patiently waiting for someone to win the game so you can start another one.  It is a lot of fun though, and very few games have even come close to being as addictive as this.

RATING: 4
A good intro game, but it seems to drag out more and more every time I play it.  The last few times I've just wanted someone... anyone to win so it would be over.  Maybe I'm playing with the wrong people that are looking for trades that aren't there or maybe I've just gotten tired of the same thing over and over.

Based on 10+ plays.

I far prefer Starfarers and as such do not usually suggest Settlers.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After placing first towns, almost no more major decisions. You cannot but do only action you can do with resources which dice rolls gave to you. Moreover, with bad rolls, you have nothing to do.

Not enough thematic feel.

UPDATE July 2007--------------------
SoC has a potential of being fun. Random map, resource production and management, some nastiness(monopoly, robber, etc.), luck and strategy... but the problem is that strategy often doesn't work.

To do any, you need resources. To get resources, you need good roll. To increase probability of getting resources, you need more settlements. But to build new settlement you need resources! So in the beginning of game, everyone has only two settlements and only three resources, getting good rolls can be crucial. Someone who gets enough resources first and build another settlement get huge advantage - she or he gets increased probability of getting resources, can take good place, and can block other players' expansion. In the middle of play after building four or five settlement there can be some ways of dealing with bad rolls, but in the beginning there is none.

Secondly, it is hard to save cards for future, you often have to do unwanted trade or build unwanted building. It is very bitter when you oards many cards only because you couldn't manage to get NEEDED resources and then robber comes out.

At last, I don't like the "sudden end." When having 8 or 9 VP and struggling for a couple of points, someone suddenly declares the end of game - it is not so pleasant. (Of course dice luck can be crucial here again) I wish there were end game.

Now I think SoC as a well-organized dice-race game...

First impression: 6.5

A good game with a nice load of player interaction, but in my short experience it seems to be too long in playing time for what it is.

It have a respectable amount of luck involved, but as a light family game it can be a choice, maybe not my first choice, but neither my last. Definitely I'll be playing it in the future wit my family.

On the side of components production, I have to say that my Devir edition is just gorgeous with it's nicely detailed plastic models of towns, cities and roads, and the amazing illustration work of Michael Menzel.

I hope to find some expansions at a good price to see if the gameplay can be enhaced.

---------------------------------------------------------

Update: 7.5

After some more games I'm begining to think that Catan is as good gateway game as Ticket To Ride. In the first few games we didn't understand the role of the area control element of the game, but now is more clear and a lot more enjoyable. I'm seeking to buy the 5-6 players expasion as usually there is one more willing to play.

---------------------------------------------------------

Update after 18 Plays: 6.0

Maybe there is to much luck involved (or my dice are seriously adverse to the statistic normal distribution), and a 5 or 6 player game (with the expansion) can get too long or too chaotic. Some times I'll be willing to play it but maybe a slightly more common choice will be to play other game.

Still I hope some day I'll buy an expansion that will make the game shine again, because deep down I know I like the game...

RATING: 7.4
Usually fun, interesting combo of luck and strategy.  

The randomness of the die rolls usually leads to one player getting screwed every game, regardless of that player's skill level.  When you happen to be that player, it's a frustrating game.  If not, it can be a lot of fun.  The variable board is excellent.  Sometimes we use the official dice deck instead of rolling, and/or play that 2 and 12 activate each other.

Not a fan of the sea pieces in the 4th ed. Mine don't lay flat, which is sort of annoying.

El primer juego tras los clásicos (monopolio, risk, Stratego) que jugué. Lo compré el año 1997 y por flojera lo aprendí recién el 2004.
Muy entretenido pero puede cansar un poco la etapa de negociación para adquirir materias, cuando se transforma en un diálogo de sordos. No da respiro ni permite distracción, porque de lo contrario otro ha logrado un mejor acuerdo.
Tal vez el factor suerte (los dados) hacen que cuando a uno le va mal, pese a toda lógica, uno se desanime y quiera jugar algo más controlable.
UPDATE: en mi último juego, junto a Seafarers, en dos horas logré hacer dos caminos; es decir, me quedé con los dos puntos iniciales. Mala suerte total; aburrimiento total. Prefiero dedicarme a juegos con factor suerte menos importante o que se pueda revertir con un buen juego. En este caso, es practicamente irrevesible remontar la mala suerte con los dados. Y lo peor, se traduce en un juego interminable...a la media hora ya quieres que termine (y a esas alturas falta una hora y media)

A little abstract, a little random, but positively tends to teach people 2d6 distribution, that's the good thing in times of all-present retarded calculator-owners. Tends to be punishing for lack of geometric planning and careless play as well as high hopes for rare numbers. In general not very rewarding, when you lose you fell like a loser, not like a next-turn-to-be-winner.

RATING: 7
Yes, it's luck-heavy, the rich get richer, and you can therefore be severely crippled by bad dice rolls early.  But with experienced players it flies by, those things tend to even out over time, and you can learn to mitigate bad luck (to an extent).  The caprice of the dice is part of the charm, IMHO.

A great gateway to the hobby for many, this is the game my group broke out when we last expanded...it's sort of a baseline game for "gamers", giving the opportunity for some easy sociable play.

My kids have learned to love this game, too, and the fact that they can grow up with this rather than Monopoly means a lot to me.

This is a great game, however, it seems easy to burn out on.  I loved it once, then grew extremely bored of it, and now like it again.

It had to be a 10. It is the one game that has seen the most plays in my collection of over 150 board games. Even after so many years it is the first one that gets picked when I want to introduce new people to the tabletop gaming fraternity. It's simple. The rules are easy to teach. People learn how to play and get into the game quickly. It provides a lot of player interaction. And almost every time this game is rolled out for a gaming session, it never stops at just one game, someone always says "Ooh, can we play again? I know what I want to try this time..." There is an element of luck, yes. But also the chance for negotiation and strategy.

My first Euro game, and still a favorite. I played a ridiculous amount of Catan in college, and it led me in all sorts of directions, board game-wise.

I'd say it has minor runaway leader issues, and sometimes initial placement can be quite frustrating -- but neither detracts from what an excellent, replayable, and satisfying gateway Euro this is.

The probability aspect is one of my favorite elements, as it nicely modulates the randomness factor. I also particularly like seeing how things shake out when a vital resource is constrained for the whole game because of tile placement.

Settlers of Catan was the game that launched me into the hobby of gaming.  I found the ability to be strategic so refreshing over classic games yet there was still that familiar mechanic of dice rolling that brought along with it the factor of luck.  Its variable modular board does create a new start setup every time but the feel of the game play does not vary after the initial start phase.  The start phase is so crucial to how well you will do in the game depending on your ability to follow through on your initial plans, which I believe takes a little away from Catan.  I've found myself not wanting to play this game over and over as I originally did but am eternally thankful to it for giving me a new hobby.

I know a lot of people adore this game, but I have NEVER liked it. Even when it was big, and I used to play it a ton. I was friends with a family that was huge into this game, so they played it all the time when I was over, and it always felt like a chore. I literally don't understand the attraction this game still has for people when there's so many better options for a gateway game. Can we just stop playing this game already?

While this game gets a lot of love, I feel it is broken in many serious ways, particularly:
1) Runaway leader.
2) Virtual elimination (being confined early on/unable to ever build a 3rd city and having to continue playing for another 45 minutes is painful and boring).
3) Kingmaker (this happens a lot due to #2 combined with trading).

I give the game top marks for the board setup phase (great variations and replayability), and the theme plus trading idea is interesting. But sadly after a dozen or so plays, I still find the gameplay weak despite its classic status.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A game that has problems with runaway leaders and leader-bashing at the same time. You usually can't do anything at all if the dice don't roll your way, and many times someone will be out of the running (but not allowed to leave) through no fault of his or her own. The only thing I like about it is the modular board, but that's not enough to save the game.

As far as I'm concerned, this is an interminable Snail's Pace Race that locks people out.

THIS GAME HAS BECOME OBSOLETE!

Pros:
1. Revolutionized the gaming industry

Cons:
1. Success is dependent on other players. It is counter-intuitive to help out other players when they are competing against you. This is not a mechanic you see often anymore (you see this in older games like Cosmic Encounter). Early in the game, it works "okay." But once a leader has been established, players typically choose to not trade with that player. This can even out the game, but it also makes it disadvantageous to have an early lead. Small World suffers from the same problem. If a game is dependent on negotiation, there need to be alliances. Fief is a game that works in this way. Settlers, on the other hand, falls flat if players aren't willing to work together. 
2. Takes too long for what it is (think Monopoly)
3. BORING! This game has absolutely no theme, the board is hard to read, and the choices just aren't interesting. 
4. Stale components
5. Perhaps most importantly, so many games have replaced this one. Every mechanic has been replicated and improved.

I'm glad I played it, but only to know that I never want to play again. Plain and simple, this game has no soul. I'd rather play Monopoly.

Update - After playing a quite a few games, I have come back to this one and like it a lot more.  It is much more streamlined and strategic than I had thought previously. Plus the old Mayfair edition that I have has very average artwork.

I marvel at the design genius of Settlers, but not the game play. I just don't enjoy it all that much. In my opinion, it takes a bit too long to play.  The foodstamp variant helps balance the luck of the dice.  I have had little luck using this as a gateway game, many others work better.

An OK mainstream game that most people have played by now. But as such, i'm all played out on this game. It relies too heavily on player negotiations for goods. And you can already pretty much tell who's going to win, based on where the starting settlements are placed. This game did wonders for the boardgaming community, but it has overstayed its welcome in my collection. Get those player negotiations out of my strategy game, and outta my face!

Still one of my favorites.  More "hardcore" gamers would scoff at that, but it has a lot of what I like in a game.  It is social (trading). All players are involved in every turn (dice rolls and trading). There is enough luck to make it interesting but enough skill that experience/strategy matters.  The theme is light-hearted and doesn't turn people off (a great thing for a gateway game).

On the downside, trading can be intimidating for new players.  The range in game time is actually fairly substantial.  Someone always seems to complain about the random board.  There is a lot of sheep on the board for it not meaning much (the Seafarers expansion helps with that).

RATING: 6.01
The crimes of Catan are these:

1. With the random board setup and the rolling of dice there's simply too much randomness in acquiring resources for my liking. Even if you could find a path to gain wheat, it could be on a tile that only produces on a 3. I like modular boards, but Clash of Cultures at least starts the same for all players until you factor in the expansion. Mage Knight has a progression of tiles. Catan looks like it does because somebody stopped stirring the gumbo. Starting position can be painfully obvious for a starting player who has played the game enough, or I could see it being an AP nightmare for a newer player.

2. And about that dice rolling for resources. There's the chance you roll and other people get resources, but you don't. Since you received no resources, you might not be able to build anything nor trade for anything. This happened multiple times in the game for me. I just think a player's turn should be an advantage and in a number of cases nothing happened for me and other players gained resources.

"But you can gain resources when it isn't your turn."

Still doesn't take away the crap feeling of a dead turn. I dislike Acquire for when you have to place a tile out in an open area but at least you can buy stocks. Catan? You get nada during a dead turn. If I were to make a creed for game design, the lack of a dead turn has to be listed. It feels inexcusable for a gateway.

3. The robber.

This issue was low for me this time. I wasn't hit much with it, but it was placed in a couple of spots a lot during the game and even one player mentioned at least once how it was being placed in their area to a fault. It's basically a randomized take on bash the leader.

Significant for its influence versus its game play these days. Even if you are picking gateway games, 7 Wonders beats this and even that's slowly growing on me. We simply make better games now. Okay, we made better games before Catan but bygones.

Rating Potential: 6-6.5. I really don't see this moving up. 7 Wonders alone scratches virtually the same itch and does it without the random factor of the robber. Takenoko is similar in that they are both gateways, but I find it more enjoyable despite its flaws. Again, not that similar, but Keyflower is another game from a design standpoint that really beats this into the ground.

Update. I think it is stuck in the 6.01 range. Expansions might give it enough legs to bump it up, but I don't see the base game going to a 7. I see no need to buy it for the obvious lack of need to due to quality and somebody else will have a copy anyway so that's the 0 in the score. After that it is merely how often I want to play it, and I'm guessing this will sneak in a once a year kind of play even if I'm going "Why am I not playing  pretty much anything else I would bring instead?"

I might prefer this as a 5-6 player game with the additional special build phase. I'll have to see how it plays as a 4-player game. Really not worth playing as a 3-player game. Trading is too difficult to make it fun. Can be more AP prone, see The Longest Turn meme, than I would like for a gateway.

2nd play of 6 player game. Yeah, um no. I fully accept the fact that I took a risk in my initial placement of my second settlement and road so I didn't give up on longest road from the start, but I was instantly blocked and thus vastly did nothing the whole game. I started on a spot for gold with a 9 on it, and it ended up being one of the lesser numbers rolled. I seriously do not get the hype for the game. 1 good play in 5 has me wondering if this shouldn't go lower. Actually, updated to a 5. I'll debate putting it at a 4.

I have a love-hate relationship with Catan. The game re-ingnited my interest in board games in 1999/2000. When jim pinto told me he couldn't stand Settlers at GenCon 2000, I thought he was insane. Now I see his point. SoC is a good game, but I've played my fill of Catan.

I own the Xbox Live version of this and as a video game I'd give it a 5.5.  It's a really good way to play by meself but the trading looses 100% of its spark.  Plus it's a bit tedious waiting for your turn on a video game.  When playing with real people at the table it's a lot more fun and I give it a 6.75.

Nice enough, but as a gateway game less interesting, varied and competitive than Carcassonne and less captivating than TTR.  The worst ageing of then non-abstract gateway games.  Can't ever think of any time in memory where I've actually felt like getting it out of the box - there is ALWAYS something better.  Indeed recently skipped joining a local board game club because they made such a play of Catan being played every meet.  What a dispiriting thought.

Unfortunately Settlers of Catan is easily the most overrated game in my collection. Catan is a long game. Worse than that, it's a boring game. Players choices are incredibly limited, and certain players can get shut out as early as the setup for the game. I do not enjoy this game.

THE GAME that brought me into this wonderful world of boardgaming. THE GAME that generates the most social interactivity and fun at the table. THE GAME most played.

Update: Been having a rather long drought for this great game. For social fun, my group(s) enjoy Manila, I'm the Boss, Citadels, or even Modern Art. The above statement regarding it being the most socially interactive and most played is no longer true.

Trading mechanic makes this game evergreen classic. Despite having excitement via dice, the actual gameplay is pretty average and even dry by todays standards, but the trading makes the game much more lively! The rules are relatively simple at least for how deep game you get. It's deserving of its status as a classic eurogame that started it all. Still a good one, especially if you're introducing new people to modern boardgaming! Expansions.. meh.

2-Player Comment:
* Settlers of Catan wasn't designed for two, but internet is full of variants to try (especially if you also own Seafarers). I prefer normal rules even for two myself, but play to 7 points only. It's no match to 3-4p game though and for most people some variant is a must.

Solid game.  While somewhat time consuming with more than 3 players, it's still not too long assuming everyone knows the game well.  Limiting the trading to only the person who's turn it is, to me, is a must.  Otherwise, the game can take too long, and the unlimited trading ends up hurting the game, IMO.

Great 4 player game if played quickly, though usually more even as a 3 player game. Slow players can spoil the game, simply because there is no excuse for AP; decisions are rarely difficult (initial settlement placement excepted). Has a lovely acceleration towards the end game, when 3 players (4 if you're lucky, but more typically someone is being crushed) are often in with a shot of winning if the dice roll their way. Fun with kids if you give them a smaller VP target (e.g. 7 or 8 vs. 10 for adult).
Liked this game enough to make a custom 3D board... guess it has to be a 10.

I realize this is a classic and really set the stage for a lot of other games, and I appreciate the game from that perspective, but I just don't enjoy playing it at all. Every time I play it, I quickly lose all interest and have zero patience for it. I just find it a slow moving game, w too little player-to-player interaction, and minimal strategy. On top of that, I find games usually take at least 45 mins, especially because there is no 'internal clock' to end the game, so it just keeps dragging on as people try to accumulate enough resources to do anything. 

I have not played any of the expansions, so perhaps those could sway me, but I also don't have any desire to play this game, so the chances of me trying an expansion are low.

This game would be very good if it wasn't a piece of painful agony from the very beginning to the latest move. Okay, it's not painful if you happen to be lucky, but for somebody it is. Results will get balanced in the long run, but because the game takes so long to play, you're not willing to see the long run, ever.

Do NOT buy any extensions. They only make the game unnecessary complex, long, and even more torturing.

And while there is a heavy luck element involved, plan several turns ahead the best that you can, i.e. watch who has been collecting what.

Good game - can understand why it is a modern classic.  The trading and robber mechanics keep things interesting, and prevent runaway leaders, but means things can become predictable.

Would be interesting to play with non gamers and see how it holds up.  A fun game overall, but there are other things I'd rather play.

I've gotten into the hobby for a little more than a year as of this writing. I realize this game is now generally thought to be past its time, and its merits as a "gateway game" are questioned, but it was the gateway game for me and my game group, and we do go back to this game regularly.

I've found it useful as a parent, my kids have learned the basics of setting up a game, taking turns, rolling dice, gathering resources, building, etc. They don't like the robber much at all (who does), and I found it interesting and funny when they banish the robber to a part of the board that isn't inhabited, so it doesn't hurt anybody. 

When this game goes bad for a particular player, it definitely is frustrating eg. when the rolls aren't going your way or the robber is on you constantly as the rest of the table gangs up on you. And the 5-6 player expansion is not as enjoyable. Nevertheless the controlled but open negotiation of trades generally keeps people engaged throughout the game.

Our favourite "base game" is to add in the fish from Traders and Barbarians (takes away the desert, and gives the table another resource), and to also play with the Harbor Master to go along with the Longest Road and the Largest Army. 

The 10 rating is in part given to historical context of my own personal journey into this hobby, as it is far and away the game I've played the most, that I continue to enjoy. It's also boosted up by our "base game" add-ins from the expansions. "Vanilla" Catan I would rate around 8 out of 10. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A classic. Aged pretty well. Some will say it's just random dice rolling, and that might seem true on your first couple of plays, but there's much more to Catan than that. It's all about positioning, trading and managing your hand to avoid the thief.

RATING: 7
The board game I've played most - over 50 online games, and over 25 in person, with 7 in one day once. I don't think it is as great with the expansion for 6, and I dislike the seafarers expansion. 

I've played this successfully as a teams game with the following rules: 
- sit across from each other
- cannot trade more than 1 resource on your turn to your teammate 
- each player needs to score 10
- can share 1 point from longest road or largest army with teammate for victory points
It reduces the trading aspect of the game, but adds a fun layer of backstabbery strategy.

Sitting through two games of Settlers recently reminded me of how much fun gaming can be, even when playing a game that's a bit lame.  Those games really brought to the fore the core issue with Settlers, which is that sellers are necessarily more motivated than buyers.  It's not even close to being equitable.  The games were fun anyway.

RATING: 4
Not a bad game, exactly, but resource acquisition snowballs and there can be a runaway leader effect that can make the game very boring for players doing poorly. If it were shorter, this would be less of a concern.

My biggest problem with it, however, is how you can often end up with nothing to do on your turn. The bare minimum of good game design is that you should have meaningful choices to make on every turn, even if none of your options are very good.

Good for its time, Settlers of Catan hasn't aged well. It remains a gateway to better fare.

It is far too long for such basic mechanics and lack of real strategic depth, and it suffers from highly formal (and utterly bland) game-end conditions, as well as a relative lack of variant approaches to success.

All of these things are probably what make it so good as a gateway: the obviousness of it all allows beginners to understand why they've won or lost, and the strong positive memories thus created tend to stick with players long after they've outgrown Settlers.

It's an important transitional piece, slightly better than other (older) games that also garner a degree of nostalgia (Risk; Monopoly), and it surely gives joy to a lot of people: over the board, however, it is deeply limited.

The variability of the board layout itself and numbered markers is what makes this a great game. You have to adjust strategies here. This also lends to high replayability. The dice add some randomness, but muffled some by the markers. The different ways to get points really adds to the fun and suspense. 

Clearly this game (and series) has been successful for a reason. You can think 3 moves ahead, or just go; either way, it's still fun. The trading aspect here is done very well. Monopoly in theory has trading, but the reality there is limited. 

Plays quickly once everyone knows how to play. 

Edit: Rating down due to overplaying it and the C&K expansion being better. After many plays, not liking the trading aspect as much as early on. Still a great series.

This game is great for those who want an exciting game for gamers of all skill levels.  Personally, I find that there is too much chance involved, seeing as how the dice play a huge role in the game.  I tend to prefer the more strategy-intensive games, such as Puerto Rico.

A lot of people hate on this game, but really, it's what started it all for me, and whenever I introduce someone to a new game, it's generally Catan. It's a great gateway game, and gets so many people into euro gaming... So it will always be a 10 in my book. No matter how many times I play it, how random it can be with the dice rolling, it's just an overall great game.

A good intro game but annoying with the luck of the dice.  Only like to play on occasions.  Other annoying feature is that one person can be way behind from the start and then it never feels like you are in the game.  That said, it was the game that got me into spending loads of money on better board games.
If you want to play two player just get rid of the robber and the game works well.  If you leave the robber in it becomes too one sided in a two player game

When I started gaming it ment everything to me.
We use 2 play it all the time, especially with the expansions (it really shines with the cities and knight expansion).
Later on, while getting to know other games the luck factor could really bother me. 
So now a days I find this a good game, fairly easy to explain, great interaction, not to agressive and a good introduction to another kind of games. But a little bit too much luck involved for my taste.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The vanilla version feels full enough, even after having played the game with expansions in the past. A decent, largely luck-based gateway game with some space for a strategy; also has a nice aspect of trading - it is very difficult to win the game without it, but by trading goods with other players you are also working towards their goals.

I think this was the first 'German-style' game that we played; always a heap of fun, and usually quite a close game too - it's rare for someone to be completely shut out of a game.

RATING: 8
Played 22 times.
Last play was May 3, 2008.

This was fun.  It was enough different from Settlers of Cannan that I don't mind having both in my collection even though the primary reason we got this was to play with the 5-6 player expansion.

The close quarters and more evenly distibuted numbers really makes this game harder, and seems to suffer from a run-away leader problem that I didn't notice in Settlers of Cannan.

The last game we played was the first really close game - but that was because my husband didn't choose to win when he had the opportuntity and then gave me the exact trade I needed to get three points at once.

Just played the game with 3 players and it was a much closer game than when we play with 4.

I've decided I just don't like this game with 4 players.  There just isn't enough realestate and tempers get raised when one player out races another player to that critical corner.  There always seems to be one player that just doesn't have a chance.  Next time we play with 4 we are going to try and use the map for the 5-6 player expansion and see how that works. (This was just confirmed again in last nights game of cities and knights - and I was the player with NO chance.)

We just played a 4 player game of Cities and Knights and used the expansion tiles and it was a much more even game.  We didn't have as much running out of space issues and there wasn't ever a run-away leader.  But ther was still penty of tension.

I know I'm in the minority here, but I don't find this game particularly enjoyable. My experience is that the randomness of the board setup and the die rolls for producing resources have too frequently resulted in situations where one player has been unable to produce enough needed resources to make any serious headway in the game.

A modern classic, fantastic fun and the variability and two main routes to victory make for interesting and engaging games. Despite the replayability the rules and concept are straightforward enough that somebody that has never played this or any other 'Eurogame' will get involved and provided they didn't bungle the initial placement they stand a good chance of making a game of it. There's a balanced pre-placed layout in the rules that helps for the first game, it is pretty scripted for anybody who's familiar with the game though, whichever colour you get you'll know what you need to do at a glance - strictly for first games only.

I came late to the world of Catan, but after having the game's merits described to me, I took a chance and brought the box home from the game shop. 

I have never once been disappointed by this game. It's a perfect mix of strategy and simplicity. Everyone gamer I know loves this game, and there's good reason for it. The game mechanics are simple to learn and understand, but the strategy and luck elements keep it interesting (or frustrating) every time.

Setup time is relatively quick after the first few plays, and average game time has been around an hour depending on how chatty people get during trading and making up elaborate stories about why they're attempting to dominate sheep production.

I've never had this much fun simply playing a game and not caring whether I'm winning or losing. My experience with Settlers of Catan is becoming the standard by which I judge all other games.

There's something I don't like about Catan and I can't put my finger on what it is.  If I know in advance that my group will be playing Settlers, I'll probably skip game night.

I don't mind the dice.  I haven't played it enough to burn out on it.  I'm not one of those people that dislikes things just because they're popular.  It tends to drag a bit by the endgame, but I don't think that's the problem either.

In fact, it's a decent game, that I mostly enjoy while I'm playing it.  But I never, ever, ever want to play it, and I would rather play almost any other game instead of it.  Oftentimes, I'd rather not play any game at all.  I just don't know why.

UPDATE: I figured it out--if I'm playing Settlers than I'm not playing Keythedral, which is a somewhat similar game but ten times better.  Imagine wanting to play Race for the Galaxy but having someone say "Let's play Crazy Eights instead!"  That's what playing Settlers is like.

This one of those games you can come back to time and time again! Simple game-play mechanics means it caters to gamers and non-gamers alike - but it still has enough depth of play to keep it interesting. Great player interaction as you jostle for space and resources. The open barter system for resources (where players can openly exchange resources) and quick turns means there is little down time and you're are consistently engaged through-out the game. Definitely worth getting the Seafarers expansion to add a bit more complexity!

What can we say about Settlers that hasn't already been said?  The game is amazing.  It is probably the best trading/resource collection/building game ever.  I have played Settlers more than almost any other board game in my collection.  I have given numerous copies as gifts.  This is definitely the game that blew open the secret of the German gaming scene.  If played competitively the game can break down to collusion.  I really prefer the original German artwork to the latter Mayfair stuff.

Have two copies of first edition mayfair and also one copy of the anniversary edition gold box.

I love this game - and so do my wife and mother-in-law.  In fact, they love it so much that the deal is my mother-in-law buys us the expansions and I teach them how to play the game.  So we play a combined 2D/3D variant of Settlers, Cities & Knights, Seafarers and Fishers, with event cards and the 5/6-player expansion if needed.  In fact, we have played this game with up to 9 people and still had a very enjoyable game.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

10/11/99 Bought. I own the English third edition from Mayfair. 

11/17/09 I finally played using the fourth edition. And... I think the graphics are terrible. Especially the port icons being so tiny. One third the size of the ones in the 3rd edition, and hard to tell apart from across the table. Some of the hill hexes were throwing us old hands off. They had so much green in them we weren't sure whether they were hills (producing brick) or meadows (producing wool). It seems the graphics guy decided to make every hex unique. Well, that's all fine and good if you're creating art. But a game must be functional above all else. And its very difficult to sweep the 4th ed. board with your eye and get a grasp of what is what without a lot of pausing to squint at stuff. Could Mayfair leave well enough alone? Nooooo.  02/21/17 Gamed with the 4th edition again plus its 5/6 player expansion. Same comments. 

I'll let my initial rating stand, as its for my 3rd edition. But if I owned the 4th edition I'd rate Settlers a 5 for the ridiculous graphics. 

03/05/16 A three-player game with the English 5th edition. The graphics were *much* better than the 4th edition. I'm not a fan of the rule changes concerning VP card play after the game is over and mixed trading & building. I feel its "dumbs down" the game. I also think taking "The Settlers of" off the box is arrogant and stupid. If I owned this version I'd rate it a 7.5.

Sure in 1995 it was a very good game and the trading aspect was great, but today I prefer strategic games without dice rolling. If you have luck in the first rounds, you can build many settlements and you'll have much opportunities to collect more raw materials that the others don't even have the chance to catch up.

This has become my gateway drug into heavier board gaming for most people. I love the strategy, the manipulation, and the chance present in this game. They beautifully meld into a balanced game that almost anyone can enjoy. It's a perfect game for people looking to move beyond Clue and Monopoly.

After a couple plays I'd say this is a solid game with great replayability and most importantly, fun for the gamer and non-gamer alike.  However, the luck factor can frustrating.  There are few enough dice-roles in this game for there to be large devations from statistical normality.

I've come to this after playing much more complex games, and it was a long time coming. I don't know why I didn't play it before, but this is far from a gateway game for me. As such, I don't feel it's as strong as many games I've played, but I can certainly see its appeal - plus its small rules set makes it easy to explain and grasp. There's good reason why so many people pick this up, and I'm sure I can introduce it to non-gamers without fear of scaring them.

It is hard to say anything unique about Settlers, but for me it earns its place via consistency.  Sure, it is rare to finish a game feeling as if you arrived at the pinnacle of gaming, but it is equally rare to feel the time wasted.  Eventually the baseline experience for games in my collection will eclipse the zone where Settlers lives, but until then, its a trustworthy and faithful inclusion.

We played this game many, many times when jas0 first got it. Moved on to Seafarers, then to other games, then added Cities & Knights. The only time we play Settlers on its own now is when we're trying to recruit new players. A fantastic idea, although still a little luck-happy IMHO.

I love Settlers, and it's a great gateway game.

I hate the 15-minute-turn problem, though, and it's WAY to easy for people to whip out their phones or chat while waiting for their turn, which compounds this problem.

Love the game, but play other things more often.

Wife loves it and cranks out 5 games an hour on the computer vs AI.

Great game to play with everybody!

Build towns, get resources and be the first to get 10 points. Each game is different, and you will need a bit of luck to get your resources, but if you play well you can manage to win.

It only has one drawback: If you don't know where to build the first towns you can make a bad decisition and the rest of the game will be boring and frustrating. So it's very important to help new players in this step.

Kolonisten van Catan
Yes, maybe I should rate this one higher, as it restarted my interest in board games 10 years ago (bought the original German version way back). And it served quite well to get more people around me into boardgames. 

For the first couple of years I had lots of fun with this, and would have rated it as an 8.

But I overplayed it (lots of people only wanted to play this game...) and got quite disappointed at the ridiculous amounts of expansions.
Now the fun factor has quite gone for me. One of the few games that I'd rather not play anymore but still don't want to give a low rating (due to showing me the Euro-way)

I'm really not interested in playing this anymore (so I should rate it an  3) unless it's with the Citizens & Knights expansion. But after Puerto Rico, I rarely played that one either...

RATING: 7
This is it. The board game that really got me into the hobby. Easy rule set and the fact you are involved in everyone’s turn is fantastic, as well as the negotiation and trading. I have played this so much I am “over” it but it deserves its credit. If someone has never played it, I would continue its use as a gateway. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely a solid game with well-balanced mechanics.  This game seems to work well both with new and experienced players, as everyone feels like they have a chance to win up until the end.  I still worry that the starting placement has too much of an impact on the rest of the game, but so far, I've not experienced any session where that's obviously been the case.  This one hit the table a lot in our group at first, especially when we're trying to push new players toward non-party games, but it has fallen out of favor lately due to a large influx of great new games.

A lot of my friends love this game, and I can have a good time playing it, but it is certainly not a favorite.  Zero decisions available without having resources to spend and resource distribution is completely probability-based.  Every game I've played has resulted in notable frustration by at least 1 or 2 players who are resource-starved and therefore unable to participate.  Certainly not the sign of a good "gateway" game.  Components are great and I'd rather play this than some other games, but I only really keep it in my collection because others enjoy it.

This is the game that introduced me to modern board gaming.  I have played this game many times over the past 20 years and it has special place in my heart for that reason. The game itself however is broken.  
Very high on luck with dice rolls, I try to mitigate this with getting a variety of numbers, but that does not always work. I have spent 5-6 turns in a row passing because all that was rolled were 4s 3s 11s and 7s and even with a lot of number options, get no resources.
Very easy to block a player with huge impact. If one player lucks out with numbers and blocks your road with one of his and beats you to a spot on the board, very early on you can tell that you have already lost.  The next 1.5 hours you go through the motions of playing for someone else to win.
Many flaws, I will likely not play this many more times in the future if I can help it.

This was my gateway game and I've been a board game collector since. Its probably one of the best gateway games out there.

Great game for "long" lunch group; however, there is a small ramp up time for newbies.  (The second playing is always better.)  Very enjoyable player interactions.  A true classic.  I raised this rating when I added in the FoodStamps house rule (no commodity this roll?  Get government cheese chit.  Cash in chits per your current point standing for the commodity of choice.)  Brilliant rule that makes it much more fun (for the unlucky) and faster (things get built quicker.)

Update after 3rd game: I like it, but while it does have some significant historical importance, I just don't think as a game it deserves more than a 7. I hopped on the board game bandwagon about 12 years too late to rate this any higher.

Game in a Nutshell: Players compete to settle and secure the best spots on a modular island. Roll dice to collect goods, trade with other players and spend to expand.

Played as: 3,4 player

Played with: Seafarers, Cities and Knights, 5-6 Player Expansion, and Plain

Pros: Good mix of luck, area control, player interaction and replayability make for an excellent, addictive game. Serves as an excellent gateway because of enough familiar mechanics combined with some fresh innovative ideas. 

Cons: It can be luck driven for players of equal experience. It's not unusual to see a person who benefits from some lucky roles early on have a sizable advantage as the game progresses.

Other: If you're reading this and haven't yet played it yourself, do yourself a favor and change that. It got me hooked to euros and more then a few people have gone out and bought it after just one game of me introducing it to them. However, having played this so much, I'd almost prefer playing any other game over this one given the choice. That still doesn't stop me from giving it big props for what this game has meant to the gaming community at large.

Best Use: One of the first gateway games people should be thinking of introducing the 'is it like monopoly?' crowd to.

Too simple without an expansion, not worth setting up and if you play with four players you can easily knock a player out of the game making it impossible for him to win which wouldnt be so bad if he didnt hafta stay and play waiting for a player to reach 10 points with the only thing left for him to do is spend the rest of his efforts screwing over the player who put him in this predicament...

The game that started it all. You have to approach this with the right attitude. 1) Never complain if your numbers don't come up, but work with what you do get. 2) Lower your trading standards for new players or people who are clearly losing. 3) Don't be in first place. Go for second and then win suddenly!

I don't mind luck in games. I do mind luck/randomness in games if it solely determines if I can do anything at all during the game. Settlers unfortunately is such a game. The one and only mechanic that decides what resources you get during a turn, if any at all, is throwing dice. If the dice roll badly, you will get nothing during your turn. That is not just a bit of bad luck which can be mitigated through proper risk management - that is putting you out of the game for the turn, while other more fortunate players run away with the win.
This also results in a huge runaway leader problem, because whoever is the most lucky in the beginning of the game cannot be reeled in, as he will be the first to build all his stuff, get more resources, and further capitalize on his initial string of luck. Catch-up does not happen in Settlers.
Other than this, Settlers could have been quite a nice game with all its then-innovative elements. However, if the game decides whether or not I get to do anything on my turn, I'll pass. It's no better than a roll-and-move mechanic were certain locations you end up say "skip your next turn".

Finally, Settlers has been caught up by time - newer releases do what Settlers is trying to do much better anyway, so why bother? If somebody suggests playing this I will reluctantly accept if and only if nobody wants to play one of my suggestions instead. Fortunately I usually succeed.

Au moins avec ce jeu vous pouvez jouer avec toute votre petite famille. Après un bon repas dominical, le feu de la cheminée crépite, et naturellement vous sortez le fameux jeu Colons de Catane. Un classique.

Le jeu a les défauts de ses qualités: il vise le grand public, les règles sont accessibles, le matos est correct sans plus.
Mais l'absence de subtilité en font à mon sens un jeu qui peut devenir vite lassant, et les mauvais jets de dès peuvent vous renvoyer à un certain état de somnolence post digestive.

Me ha causado muy buena impresión. Un juego de recursos nada complicado y que mantiene en vilo toda la partida. Lo mejor: la interacción entre los jugadores a la hora de comerciar y el hecho de que no se hace excesivamente largo (75 min. aprox.) para ser el tipo de juego que es. Lo peor: mucha aletoriedad en los dados y con mucha influencia del factor suerte.

I heard a few bad things about dice rolling that discouraged me from getting it. Then I got it for christmas. And it's the best gift I got. A great game to introduce people to the field, it still holds up us fun and strategic after the initial fascination. 2012 edit - After years of plays it's still solid, but it's never in my top 5.

RATING: 6
Good for casual players, it has a good replayability and you have always to adapt your strategy accordingly to the terrain generation. Diplomacy is often at the core of the game but can also be a weak point (it can increase considerably the game lenght). 

We used to play our two player variant quite often until more modern games (e.g. Terra Mystica) came out.

UPDATED ON 5/2/18: since January 2018 my wife and i have been playing the app version quite often (especially when we are distant), instead of the board game.

Con el descubrí de nuevo los juegos de mesa, divertido si juegas con no jugones o gente no muy competitiva, si no...para mi se vuelve un infierno. Se puede volver largo y dependiendo de la disposición inicial puedes transformarte en un mero espectador de la partida sin opciones reales de pasar un buen rato. El factor azar de los dados, en lo que se basa el juego, hace que me lo piense mucho antes de sacarlo o incluso proponerlo.

Good 2- or 4-player game.  Great to introduce people to gaming, quick enough to play in an hour.  Certainly a worthy successor to Monopoly as the staple game in all homes.  People complain about the randomness, but this means they are not playing very well.  Plus, in a game so short and simple to play, who cares if there is some variability?  The option to trade can overcome many of the difficult time with the dice.

We don't play it as often as we used to, but we've had many fun games of Settlers.  If it had a decent 2-player game, we would likely have played it a lot more.  The tile-constructed board, and differing scarcity of resources makes each game different, and gives the game enduring appeal.  The game naturally encourages players to target the leader, which gives some people the grumps, but also produces close finishes with most people "in the hunt" until the end.  Still a very enjoyable game, that often earns a place if we have a weekend away.

If I'd started logging plays 5 years earlier, this would probably have another 30 plays against it.

CLASSIC

Two sheep for 1 wheat?

Brian (BBD): "When you all play Catan do you say things like, 'Hey, we should play a game of Catan!' when you ask people to play? Or do you say things like 'A large natural disaster has destroyed an entire island nation and reformed it with a completely different setup of natural landmarks. 4 hardy adventurers are needed to bring civilization to this untamed land. Much danger lies ahead, but this task is essential to bring balance. Do you have the guts to be one of those 4 chosen?'"

 "Also I will kick all yall asses in Catan. I swear on my confederate pride and the grave of Robert E. Lee. When my longest road cuts off your attempt to get to that sheep port, remember the South Will Rise Again."

BBD: "There is boring Catan and then there is "Real World: Catan" where danger lies ahead and the stakes are high"
Robin: "Probably the former, but should I be invited to a game of Catan with the latter, I will surely accept."


Me: "We never talk anymore, Twin."
Drunk Seth: "Yes we do! We talk all the time! I'm always asking you if you want to trade 2 grain for a wheat!"

RATING: 6
02/08/2013: This game has been around a while and seems to have brought a lot of people into the hobby.  I started with Carcassonne but soon picked this up because of the sheer amount of "press" it gets around here...good and bad.  I think a lot of negativity has arose just because so many gamers have played it too much.

I think it's a very solid game that can have stretches of poor luck thrust upon you from the dice rolls.  Players are trying to build roads, settlements, and cities on the island of Catan, earning VP along the way.  The first to 10 VP is the winner.  Two things come to mind when I think of Catan - trading and those dice.  You collect resources based on the number rolled with the dice.  Usually, you'll get something, but there can be seemingly endless stretches where you get diddly.  One thing we just tried out was too use some coins (from the Settlers of America game) when someone receives zero resources on any turn.  They can then trade in two coins for any one resource.  That really helped a lot with the flow of the game and randomness of the dice.  However, it did seem to affect the other main mechanism of the game.

Trading is a big part of this game.  You must be willing to trade with any and all players throughout most of the game.  Someone is always needing resources and if you can find a trade that will help both players, you'll be successful.  However, when we played with the coins, that did seem to stymie the trading just a bit.  If you're asking for an Ore and you've got two or more coins in front of you, that made the other players hesitate regarding the trade.

Anyway, I'm really going on too long about this stuff.  The game is very good.  Very fun.  It runs a little long with my family though.  Our last play (with coins) was a solid hour and a half...and that was quick for us.  The components looks nice and are mostly good.  However, right from the get go, the framing tiles (the water) that goes around the main island were warped and unusable.  That wasn't a big deal; just set up the island and use the harbor tiles instead.  But when we played recently, I noticed that several of the tiles are staring to warp as well.  That's not cool.  I store my games in my bedroom closet so there shouldn't be an issue with "weather conditions."  And considering we've only played this half a dozen times, the game should be in pristine condition.  I'm a little upset about that.  Otherwise, the cards and dice, and wooden pieces are all standard, good quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I think this is a fun game.  The only problem is that people who have played it have often played it to death.  People that have not played it look at all of the tiles and pieces and assume it is too complicated.  I feel there are other games that provide a better gaming experience.

Excellent potential for getting future gamers hooked. Good variety with all the different expansions as random setup. Excellent player interaction - the more the merrier. I love playing 6-player with everything, where the trading is intense. I've played enough that I really do need to replace my resource cards. (Only started logging plays in 2003.)

And yet tonight, it is no longer a 10 for me. There's just too much sensitivity to the initial setup, and once in a while the game just becomes a chore. It's not short enough that you can just wipe that off and play again, so it's not a 10.

Played this quite a bit years before coming to BGG. It's a decent game, but can be annoying due to high variance in the income. Also there is no real way to catch up once you are behind.

RATING: 5
Finally got to play this classic, Prototype of the eurogames, and all the other honorifics it is known for... and having done so, I can say understand both sides: those who praise it, and those who praised it but now claim it's done.

It is simple enough that it can be called a gateway game and yet I can see why so many say it has durability. It is a cute resourse gathering and trading game; however it is soooo far from perfect. Its greatness comes from what it's done for boardgaming, but evaluating as it is now (and that's how it should be done), it's nowhere near a 10 or a 9. 

It does play fast, I don't see any serious issues with scalation and it can play from 3 to 6 (although you need the expansion, or you're stuck with 4), nice art and components, set up is no big deal... but the resourse gathering...

It is both why it can be a gateway game, and the reason a good deal of gamers (especially eurogamers) might have a problem: depends on dice roling. You can play the odds and search for the most likely numbers to come up during the placing of your cities at the beginning, but is still luck and you can have a hard time if it's not your day. 

In theory, the trading aspect it's there to make up for that, but if you're playing with people really trying to win (and while I understand not being a S.O.B. is good, I don't think I could blame someone for trying to win), they can really twist your arm in those trades, so you can probably get that much needed wood or brick, but at such a cost, you might as well not have.

It is fun and I want to play more, but in general, if I'm going to play an euro, I'd rather play those where your resources don't depend solely on rolling dice, but on strategy.

I only occasionally suggest to play this, but I will always say yes to an offer to play it and enjoy it. So definitely between a 7 and 8 on the scale, leaning towards the 8 end.  It's not a brain burner, but it does require both light strategy and light tactics.  Negotiation/wheedling skill can be a large factor, but I haven't ever seen the game totally thrown by one player being particularly good at cajoling others.  This luck factor in this game tends to be blown out of proportion rather frequently here at the BGG.  Yes there are dice rolls involved, but the game gives you plenty of opportunities to mitigate the effect on you, if you wind up far behind and out of the game once then it may have been die rolls.  Twice in a row, then it probably is a bad strategy not a 'luck' issue.

RATING: 5
Eh. It's a good game, but it also really irritates me. I dislike having to discard my hand when the thief is drawn, as it penalizes the main strategy of getting around another major flaw in the game: The dice rolls for resources. The game ends up boiling down to a competition for the resources that are statistically most likely to come up the most, and the harbors to offload them, which makes turn order way too important. 

Upgrading towns to cities doesn't seem worth the effort compared to building roads and development cards. The longest road and largest army will outright win the game for you. It's also too easy for players to get boxed in and screwed, or simply unlucky in their dice rolls. While there's a lot of good social interaction and strategy therein, other parts of the game seem determined to turn it into monopoly.

This is a funny kind of game after you play a lot of it. Most of the decisions during the game are pretty obvious. You build what you can, you trade to build what you almost can. The initial placement seems to be the game. It's pretty interesting and usually decides the game. The rest of the game plays out pretty automatically and is just there to resolve who played the best in the placement phase. Still, I like it.

Finally got to play it. It is a bit longer than I had expected, but it is enjoyable the first time. Okay for four players. After a second play, I had to downgrade the rating. It is possible for someone to spend the entire game doing nothing if the dice rolls are unfavorable. That nearly happened to me. It's one thing to have an element of chance or randomness, but to make someone sidelined for hours, that's not fun at all. It gets a "2" rating (rather than a 1), because I did enjoy it the FIRST time I played.

First German-style board game I ever played.  I enjoy the mix of luck (die rolling to determine which resources are produced), strategy (where to put cities, where to build roads, what to build), and player interaction (trading resources).  The heavy reliance on luck for production is the primary downside; this isn't as intense as Puerto Rico or Louis XIV.

[Update: While I still enjoy playing this with new players (it's a great introductory game), it's a bit too luck-based for my current tastes.]

A light gateway game and deserves its place in history. Little to no skill in the game. The game is heavily decided by luck. When you fall behind there is no mechanism to catch back up. You often have lost after initial city placement even if you don't realize it. Trading is lackluster - don't trade with the leader(s) and the leader usually is far enough ahead not to need to trade with the 2nd place player. Area control with roads is interesting but usually not possible for most players (at least 1 player always starts without wood and brick). This game would be more interesting with more resources to use, more strategic decisions about how to use those resources (rather than just playing as soon as possible), a larger board allowing for more area control, revamped trading rules to encourage trading, and a catch-up mechanism for the last place player.

A great game which involves a lot of interaction amongst the players. Trading makes up a big part in it which makes it so interesting as you sometimes have to sacrifice resources in order to trade them for another resource in smaller amounts which will eventually lead to a successful accomplishment of some sort. The only bummer is the luck factor which does consume a big part of the game. Hopefully an expansion can fix this. It is a really fun family game and I'd recommend it to anyone.

Considered by many as one of the premiere “gateway” games, this is the title that got me into the much broader and deeper world of board games so, it holds a special place in my heart. Players are settling the world of Catan by trading resources and building settlements, cities and roads to be the first player to achieve the number of points needed to win the game. Easy, elegant, quick to pick up and explain and, of course, fun to play!  Trading and strategically placing key roads and buildings are well balanced. A must for any game household!

Collect and trade resources to be the first to expand your settlement to 10 points.

Complexity: Family game = a game that is easy to teach and play.
# of players: 4.
Playing time: 90 mins.
Player interaction: Trading. Competition for scarce resources - settlement locations. Targeting - placing the robber.
Randomness: Medium - dice, but you can prepare for rolls to some extent.

Replayability: Medium. This is always a good experience and most people are fine to play again, but maybe not right away? There is some depth to explore.
Fun: Good fun. Trading makes it highly interactive. It's fun when your numbers come up, less fun when they don't.
Memorabiity: Not so high, it's still a VP engine that doesn't create stories.

Thematic integration: Weak.
Components: Nice.

I changed my January 2011 rating of 7.9 down to 6.75 on 5/4/16, to reflect what I have been telling people for years - this is an excellent "gateway drug" game for getting people into the board gaming hobby, but it just isn't that much fun to me any longer.

A combination of expansionism and rolling dice, with a rudimentary card system on the side, this game is lean and mean.  Expand your abstract cities and roads based on the accrual of 4 resources; and do so in a way that makes life harder for the other folks on the board.  Many fundamental Euro game principles at play here, and thus many prospective gamers find it to be delightful.

In boardgaming culture, the term 'Gateway Game' applies to any game that reintroduces players to the hobby. These games generally have more strategic depth and interesting decision making than 'classic' board games.

Catan was my gateway game. I played the hell out of Catan when I first got it. I kept it in my car for quick access, I played it so often. It is an excellent game, with many exciting opportunities for player interactions.

Now that I have more experience with the hobby, there are a few aspects of Catan that bug me. I'm not a big fan of the dice-rolling aspect, but the game does a good job of keeping the playing field level. In a lot of games, one player can end up far ahead of the other players, though this situation doesn't come up too often. These criticisms aren't very big, but they are worth mentioning nonetheless.

Overall, Catan is an excellent game, and I would happily play it at any time.

Sidenote: Never make a 3 for 1 trade.

RATING: 8
This game is very fun, but I cannot imagine someone liking this and hating monopoly.  The trading, the dice, the building "houses and hotels", the cards giving you extra resources and similar goodies......it's all very familiar, but it is more fun with the right crowd, if you're willing to teach newcomers.  But everyone knows monopoly and it's basically the same game.

I dont understand why this game is so popular. I didnt had much fun playing it. I did won though (in the pocket! :P). I played with the Cities & Knights expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Only played it once.  Didn't think it was all that great or engaging even though it's well-loved here.  Easy rules and fairly light game but nobody seemed that into it.

Edit: After the second play, I remembered why I hated this game.  Terrible if you get nothing.  Initial placement and the minor luck factor pretty much runs the game.  Trading becomes detrimental/pointless by mid-game.  Sort of boring and not much thinking needed in between turns, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but everyone takes forever trying to trade.  Ugh...never again.  Drags on WAY too long at times.  Rating down to 2 from 5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A good introduction to 'real' board games for most inexperienced gamers, however leaves me feeling bored about two turns after choosing the initial set up.  Mostly just luck-based stats after that.

Personally, I think the game is much too long for what it is.  Most meaningful choices in it are made before the game's start, then the rest of the game is just letting the winner pull slowly ahead of all the players enough to assure them that they were indeed the winner.

RATING: 7
One of the greats.  Certainly my gateway game.  Played it so rabidly in 2012 that these days I'm less apt to propose it--the rating reflects that--but this thing deserves its praise and success.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It was very difficult to rate this game. For a long while we really enjoyed the game. But as we got better we realized it was definitely prone to some tremendously boring games. There is a good chance you can end up with no resources and nothing to do. 

I can't imagine we will put it on the table anytime soon. So with regret I call it a 5, even though at one time I might ahve called it an 8 or 9.

Catan is a pretty solid game I have only a mild interest in playing anytime soon. If someone wanted a bridge from Clue or Monopoly into something more modern and advanced, I would happily show them Catan. Personally I'd rather play something else but it's a good gateway game.

Best thing about catan- the trading/bartering/social element.  However, not always a fan of the game-deciding initial set-up.  Also, no matter how much I know the "odds" even out over time, it always seems like someone in the group gets no luck with the dice, and it kills the game for them.

Közel 20 évvel a megjelenését követően játszottam vele először, a pontszám ezt is tükrözi. Lehet, hogy a kilencvenes évek végén még bejött volna.

Android appja van csak meg, a dobozos táblást nem vállaltam be, mert ahhoz elég gyengécske szegény, hogy még a helyet is foglalja (az appot meg egy bundle akcióban vettem, kb egy gombóc fagyi áráért). Először a táblással játszottam, aztán adva neki egy újabb esélyt, megnéztem az appot is. Kár volt.

Maga a játék nem lenne rossz, ha nincs az a rettenetesen idegesítő dobókockás mechanizmus a termelésre, ami miatt körökig várnod kell, hogy megkapd az utolsó fádat az építkezéshez, mert senki sem hajlandó cserélni veled.

Szóval a mechanika így 20 évvel a kiadását követően már elég köhögős, és dühítő is olykor, tényleg csak megszállottaknak, dobókocka fetisisztáknak és azoknak ajánlom, akik még csak a Ki nevet a végén? - Gazdálkodj okosan! játékokig jutottak el a társasjátékok izgalmas világában.

A többiek ezt nyugodtan ki is hagyhatják...

RATING: 7.8
This game has sort of been left in the dust for me.  It really is a great game.  I think the trading part can become a bottleneck for time, but not too bad.  I also don't like how you can get locked out of resources for the whole game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is absolutely a classic. I would be willing to bet it is #2 or #1 if BGG polled which game is owned by the most number of BGG'ers. The best part of this game is the interaction during the trading phase. The discussions (and usually the raucousness that ensues) change it from a board game that is played to a gaming experience.

Wish I could play this more... everybody's sick of it. Update! Now that I'm addicted to this on Xbox Live I'm upping my rating to a 8! I love this game! A pinch too much luck involved, or I'd give it a 9. Another update! I've now played it to death online. I'm bringing it back down to a 7 due to luck playing too heavy a role. (for a game w/ this much luck I think Thebes is more fun) Update: Been playing this with friends who are just getting into euros - they love it... goin' back up to 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
Gotta say it's _still_ a good game. Mostly this is because of the social interaction between players (how long through the game before we screw eachother over?). Partly it's because I've been able to use it to lure several people away from the clutches of the dreaded roll-and-move.

My gateway to the world of boardgames via Xbox Live. A very special game.

Still a classic, still enjoy it but a little of the magic has worn off, esp after playing Cities and Knights. I'm also more excited to play something newer to me, since I still have many games that have yet to be played, or only played a few times.

I've printed up the Harbor Master card but have yet to use it. I also ordered some purple pieces for Catan/Cities & Knights/Seafarers for the wife.

Played this a lot before I started logging plays at BGG.

While I appreciate the Renaissance of Gaming attributed to [i]Settlers[/i], a 5 fairly represents my personal experience with the game. I've played more than ten times, but most of those outings were not very fun. Most people I've played with also have found it to be repetitive, too long for what it is, and luck driven in a frustrating way. I want to like it more, but I don't. [11 plays]

Archetypal euro-game with more decision-making/strategy than the other pillar of the industry, Carcassonne.  A tad of randomness keeps it interesting, although wiley traders will bubble to the top.  I've rated it so high because of it's veratility in audience:  this would be a hit with a quartet of game newbies or seasoned strategists.  As long as the skill levels of the players are similar, the game will always be competitive.

It's not a perfect game, it's theme doesn't exactly match the mechanics and it does have that random element that probably drives some people nuts, but judging by the amount of time spent on the table it's still our gaming group's favorite game.  

I have bought the Seafarers expansion and played a game of that, but I personally prefer the original.  Settlers is an "island" generated by laying hexes of various resources (+ one desert), and then surrounding it by sea hexes.  Numbers (reflecting die rolls, which also includes probabilities in a simple dot system) are placed on each of resources, and the black piece -called The Robber- is placed in the desert.  The mechanic of placing settlements over corners of hexes and then a road segment adjacent to it seems at first blush to favor the player who places two settlements in a row, but that is not the case as smart roadbuilding and sticking to a sound strategy will win out in general.

The rolling of the dice to get resources makes a statistician want to play the resources with the best chance of coming up (6 and 8, because 7 moves the Robber), but if those resources are mainly wood and brick, then in the late game that doesn't help you very much.  You have to balance out the early game (building roads and settlements) with the late game (cities, soldier cards, and development cards).

Not the great gateway game folk seem to think because newbie play can make this game very frustrating. 

A superb game when playing folk who know at least a few basic strategies, although great play can be out done by bad luck and poor trading.

Will only play this with 4 preferably experienced players/gamers.

*update* will never play this with 3 and will avoid having the desert tile in the middle of the board.

Settlers was my first Euro game, the game that taught me how to say "Game of the Year" in German (even if I can't spell it), the first modular board game I ever played, and really my bridge game from role playing to board games.  I never knew games like Settlers existed until GenCon in 1997.  I played it a ton (many, many times before I started logging plays on BGG), and taught it to so many friends that I got sick of teaching the rules.  Even though it rarely sees the table these days, I still put it in my own personal Hall of Fame, and therefore rate it a 10.

Catan is one of those games that gets a lot of people interested in games. It always gets the same questionable reaction at first, but after the first round, everyone are catan-pro's and are having a blast. I'm actually not sure if I should expand on the base game or not.

I'm sure this is fine, and I can see how people might get obsessed with this game. For me, it felt too long relative to the decisions I was making. I favor any of the other standard gateway games in this respect. This one's more interactive than Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne, but if that's what you want, Pandemic also has players chatting it up in about half the time.

This was my gateway game, and the board game I have spent most of my time playing (other than MTG and Blood Bowl).  Even today, this game is as fun and refreshing as it was when I first got into board gaming, although I prefer to play with the expansions now.

This game is basically the Super Mario Bros. of board games.  It came out of nowhere while the awful Atari library (Monopoly, Risk + co., etc) were dominating American board gaming.

After many plays this game is beginning to feel a little 'played out', but its still a fun game to bring out from time to time and it's great to introduce to people new to the hobby as a whole.
It is possible that, because of poor dice rolls, you can spend a long period of the game unable to do anything. As a result, Settlers has a highly variable playing time depending on the availability of resources.

A fun game. I bought it to avoid playing with a person I don't like, and it gives my roommates and I something to do together.

I've played this several times with 2 players and with 2+ players (with the 5-6 player expansion). I have to say that 5/6 players can get a bit crowded, but often is the most fun. Playing with two is a bit slow, but the games are always really close.

However, the luck with rolling the dice can be frustrating, and the trading aspect often leaves my friends cranky at the table.

Still, a good game over all.

One of my brothers is so rich that he actually gave this game to me because he had two copies. I finally played it a year after he gave it to me. 

It's a great game. The board changes with every game, which is always a great concept because it keeps the game fresh. The trading aspect is fun and like Monopoly's, but much faster. There is a good mixture of luck and planning because there are many ways to win. I might just rate this game higher in a few weeks after playing it more.

A good game for players who have not been introduced to real board games yet. Plenty of interaction and easy to learn. Beware: a 6-player game will take all evening!

Catan won too many compliments. Now I just talk about the cons. First, the number of players are strict, only 3-4. Second, as a gateway game, it takes too long for non-gamers to focus on it.

RATING: 7.5
+1.5 strategy outweighs rule-book (Beginners seem to take to this game wonderfully)
+1 'Engine building' aspects are enjoyable
+1 good balance of "just doing my thing over here" and "take that!" mechanics which appeal to a broad range of players
+1 trading mechanic adds a whole layer of depth and strategy. 
+1 apparently very replayable (been a staple of a couple of my groups for years) which brings its rating up since I first owned it

-1 (up from .5 - more I play, the more playtime seems to lag) not the lightest game, with a little setup and a few minutes teaching time and an hour or  so to play
-1 players who make bad decisions early on can be left with little to do for almost an entire game. Predefined placements and pips for statistical likelihood help. 
-1 For whatever reason, this game seems to lead to more saltiness and hurt feelings than other games. Possibly the bluntness of the mechanics, possibly the fact that 'entirely do my own thing' is only an option for so long/if at all. 

A classic for a reason. May lose points over the years, but hasn't as of yet. Still the first boxed game I show new players.

I don't really understand how highly regarded this game is. For me, it represents everything I don't want a board game to be.

It's slow, it's boring, and it strongly encourages people to ruin for each other. A slow and destructive game, I can't really think of a worse combination. For me, 7 Wonders is the exact opposite, fast pace and constructive all the way. If a board game can be that, why play something like this?

Fine game. For some reason we don't play it anymore.
Maybe because the theme is a bit abused now; but Catan still does many things right, including the smart idea of using the corners of the hexes.
My nephew is new to boardgames and he absolutely loved it at first sight, so I've recently re-discovered it.

The game that inroduced me to modern board gaming. Now I tend to play it only with cities & knights because it gives more strategy and meat in the base game. Sometimes the dice just hate me and it can make the game a drag. That is because I don`t play Settlers so often anymore. Troyes, Kingsburg and Stone age deal with dice in a better way so they have replaced Settlers pretty much completely.

Egyik játszópajtimnak van meg egy pár kiegészítővel együtt. Már rágtam a fülét egy ideje, hogy hozza már el egyszer! Aztán legutóbb nála játszottunk, úgyhogy nem volt kibúvó.
Remek játék, baromira élveztem!! Rendkívül egyszerű szabályok (csak az alappal játszottunk), nincs min sokat gondolkodni, és bevon a játék minden másik játékos körébe is. Az üzletelgetést minden játékban élvezem, itt is jókat mulattunk rajta; ami talán kicsit zavaró lehet, az a kocka, bár ezt most nem éreztem (most szerencsém volt, és jól jött ki nekem). Igazából némi izgalmat hoz, hogy várjak e még, vagy cseréljek...

But we play it almost every week since we bought it.

"Die Siedler von Catan" - quasi der Urvater des modernen Eurogames und das Spiel, was Brettspielen salonfähigk gemacht hat. Es ist auch heute noch ein tolles Spiel und kann sich gegen moderne Vertreter durchaus behaupten. Und wer diesen Klassiker noch nie gespielt hat, sollte das unbedingt nachholen.Viele Mechaniken, die heute fast schon "Standard" sind, wurden hier eingeführt. Der Eine oder Andere wird sich eventuell am hohen Glücksfaktor (Würfelwurf = Ressourcenvergabe) stören, trotzdem wird "Siedler" ein Spiel sein, was man auch in 10 oder 20 Jahren noch auf den Tisch bringen wird.

It&#039;s cleverness, although somewhat faded after a BUNCH of plays, never completely fades away.  It&#039;s also a wonderful tool for converting new people to gaming.  The best of it&#039;s kind, in my opinion.  So, in addition to being fun, it serves a purpose at the same time.

Same old story: this one got me hooked in high school back in the early 2000s. Mistakes in reading the rules plus house rules evolved over the years have led to a unique variant that we play.

It was nice until I realized that you can sit 3 or 4 turns without any of your "most statistically likely" resources ever turn up... too random. Not to say that as soon as you are 2 points in the lead, the players can just gang up on you and you can say bye to any chances of winning... kind of sucks. I don't like it.

What on earth did the designers do to get you all rating this game so highly? Did they come round to each of your houses with a ham, tell you you're beautiful and touch you on the leg?!

This game is a lesson in self flagellation. Rolling dice and waiting for your number to come up so you can actually do something whilst your opponents get resources from rolling double 1 9 times in a row and shoot to victory is boring and not fun - a bad combo for any game.

Yeah so there's some strategy with road/settlement placement and trading, but that is also SO dependant on you having resources from those dice rolls that there's very little to do but watch if you haven't received what you need.

There clearly lies its mainstream popularity; anyone can win this game regardless of experience or skill, as at the end of the day its just down to dice.

Maybe the reason it slammed me so hard is because I expected it to be deeper with more strategic depth- this is really just a dice game disguised as a Euro.

I don't really like Catan after playing it for the 10th time. You finally realize that if you don't place your first two settlements correctly then you are completely screwed throughout the game. This is not a game for people who are sore losers or can't handle watching those around them reap the rewards of the dice while you get screwed. Trading adds more social awkwardness. I think Catan is ONLY a good game with the expansions involved.

Good game to play with family or group of boardgames and non-boardgamers. Random luck enough of a factor to allow newbies a chance to win with experienced players.  I  found game less enjoyable with expansions  and,  worse,  I lost the non-gamers who might have enjoyed it before  I  treasure the elegant simplicity of the base game. 

Good negotiations aspect and some small bit of take that. As someone who grew up on diplomacy int 1970's, I would never introduce that to your players myself, because it can bring out the worst in people.  This game is far better in teaching a skill set to young players without teaching them the bad aspects of a game like diplomacy. 

A hall of fame level game. A fixture in my top 10 and the  second oldest game deign among my top 10.

I never understood what the big deal was.  It's just really boring.

I'd much rather be blowing up giant robots or something.

"I just got this new game today, it's supposed to be awesome! Let's play it."
"Sure! What's it all about?"
"Well, you play these settlers? on, like, an island? And you get this stuff to build roads."
"Yeah...? And then what happens?"
"Well... That's about it... I think... No, wait! you can trade the stuff with other people. And you can make your little house thingies bigger."
"Uh... Do you have to, like, fight off the other players or natives or something?"
"Umm... No. But there is a thief! He can really mess you up, I guess."
"That's cool.. So you track down the thief and kick his ass or something?"
"Hmm... No. He just sort of roams around and prevents you from doing stuff. But you can't really do anything to him."
"So, what you're telling me is that this is a game where we get wood and bricks on little cards in order to build roads and the only interaction is asking someone if they want to trade some boring shit with each other in order to... build some more roads...? And there's a thief but not really since it's just a random mechanic to screw people over. Right? You're telling me that this is a game about building a road?"
"Yeah... Pretty much..."

I like the game mechanics of SoC, especially the trading and the development cards. I can't help but feel that the first half of the game is mostly just sitting around waiting for good dice rolls to occur. And then the last third is about players wondering how to advance while avoiding helping the leader. I must try Catan with a dice deck (easily made from two decks of ordinary playing cards) to see if it plays better. Many people call Catan a good "gateway" game I think Hollywood Blockbuster or Carcassonne are much more accessible to the uninitiated. It might work better with those who are already on the verge of becoming geeks.

A good game. However, the starting phase is a huge drag and often the table will go silent as everyone goes through the boring moves of slowly collecting resources.

Once you're there, however, the game is fun, challenging and exciting.

This is a classic. Well-balanced, and interesting. Excellent both for casual and experienced gamers. The tiled board setup makes for a new experience each time you play.

-Robber
-Having multiple turns without anything to do because your numbers didn't get rolled

The game I played the most before I really got into board gaming. I mean, what other game lets you build towns and cities, and gain increasingly more resources when you do so while also allowing you to negotiate with others; am i r8?! No wonder I considered this a masterpiece at the time.

If Dead of Winter has the meanest dice of all time, Catan probably has the meanest gaming piece of all time: the Robber. This little sh*t used to make the people I played with literally cry. Luckily, we all kinda realised this and only put it in someones place if that guy was far ahead.

Also, going through multiple rounds without getting anything just sucks, especially if all the others get huge amounts.

Catan: Cities & Knights is absolutely required for me to enjoy this game though.

While I'd rather play other games now, it still's got the advantage of being the simplest build, receive more and trade game I know of. Be careful not scare the new-lings away from the hobby with the robber though!

What can I say? It started a trend and deserves every praise it gets. 

Becomes more interesting when played as a match over several games which alleviates the randomness. I love it that you always think you are in control but really are a slave to the dice. Also great is the 'surge from behind' so that you can win (and certainly fight) even when in an apparently hopeless position. 

I would like to see a good two-player variant and an official 'scoring' for 2nd (3rd) place to alleviate kingmaker problems.

This was my first so-called "Euro" or "German-style" game. Here on the Geek, you'll find a lot of negative comments leveled at this game. Don't let them distract you as the game is sound and stands on its own.

Also recommended is Starfarers of Catan, by the same designer.

Honestly, I don't play Catan that much anymore. Still, it's the perfect "bridge" game, when played by three players, and I've found a lot of non-gamers getting hot on this game and it's dice rolling, card trading, tile placing madness. Yes, the game is not that balanced. Yes, it is long. Yes, there are more "deep" games out there. But in 3 or 5 (with the expansion) is still one of the funniest game you can play.

I FINALLY got the chance to play this with my family and we had a great time.  There were times where I thought my wife or daughter was going to tip the game over in frustration due to getting hit by a Monopoly card, the Robber, path blocked, and bad dice.  I haven't seen that come from them so they were obviously getting into the game!

This game is great fun as long as you play it 2-3 times a year. When it's at its best it can be very tense and exciting, but for the most part it tends to drag on. In some games, you feel like half of the game time consists of moving the Knight around, which makes game progress crawl to a halt.

RATING: 7.5
One of my groups go-to's. Always fun, with a fairly quick learning curve, and with a decent amount of strategic based competitive play. It took two years of playing it before I decided to pick up an expansion...and I still feel like we've only scratched the surface of the base game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Still a fun game 20+ years later. The only unfortunate thing about this game is that it really needs exactly 4 players in order to be a good game. I still have yet to try any of the major expansions, but I do still appreciate the game in its base form.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
If you have found yourself into gaming you owe it to yourself to get a copy of this. Play it for a while then expand with Seafarers (assuming you like it).

It's a great 'classic' Euro - our introduction to these games. We still enjoy despite having more 'sophisticated' games to play. The draw back with newbies is that we are so much better at playing than they are. Though that is now only the case after years and years of play. 

Well worth the money then.

What else can be said about this game that has not been said already?  No wonder why it was game of the year in 1995. You collect resources (wool, lumber, brick,ore, and wheat) to trade them in to build things, namely roads, settlements or cities.  You get points for the builings, first to 10 wins.  I'm looking forward to acquiring seafears and knights and cities.
It's become one of our groups favorites.

Luck-fest in a box. Nothing happens for you if the dice says NO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good solid game. I'm probably the 15th million person to say it... but it definitely is a very good "gateway" style game. There is the good old VP chase common to hundreds of other Euro games but there's also multiple paths to victory, trading, frustration and elation in the dice rolls, road/city building and a variable modular board which makes for a slightly different game each time. All in all a very good game... not quite great because it's still a bit too easy to be hosed by the dice no matter how hard you try to trade and negotiate your way out of the hole you are in when that damn robber is sitting on your production hex.

Above everything else this game produces fun sessions with a lot of chatter and banter. Lot's of "Why are you picking on me?" and "Move the robber there to stop him from getting the sheep he needs" type of conversations. Just for the level of interaction the game provides its worthy of its status as a good solid family game that can be played for fun without much concern who wins or loses.

RATING: 6
I will start by saying that I have played this game more than all the other games in my collection together, times 10.

The reason that I love this game is because it is the game that got me into gaming.  I think that I probably wouldn't play the games that I do today if it weren't for Catan.

However, I have never played a game that causes more division in friendships than Catan.  I have left the game table frustrated more times than I can count when I play Catan.  By nature in this game, every action that you take to progress yourself inhibits another player from winning.

Overall I rank this game a 6 because it is easy to understand, I played it frequently in my early years, but it is incredibly difficult to play without becoming incredibly competitive and frustrated.

The game that started it all. It's great, but it has it's flaws. Last time I played, my wife cut me off at the very beginning, making it virtually impossible to win. I called her a bad name, and later shamefully vowed to never play it again.

The trading aspect is great, but once you know the trick to a great setup--it loses its fun.

This game is perfect for a game night: simple to learn, little waiting times between player turns and finished quickly. For individual games it may be difficult to come back from a bad start but there is always time for a re-match. During a memorable vacation with friends, I lost the first seven games but came back and won three in a row. 

Pros: Simple rules, all players participate to the end, short game sessions
Cons: Chance important for outcome, difficult to get back from bad start

RATING: 6
Classic Euro-game that proves to be both easy to learn, strategic enough to remain popular in my gaming group, and with dice rolls and tile placement, it feels new each game!!

update: As with most board gamers, Catan reaches it's limits soon enough.  My main issue with Catan stems from the resource collection. Often times it takes several turns for a player to get any resources.  This prevents them from playing or trading.  This can sometimes be negated by better starting placement of buildings, but the roll of the dice plays such a big part that often times the best placement yields poor results.  Possibly some house rules could be instituted or the a better expansion, such as Pirates and Traders.

This game is charming. Great family game. The robber bugs me, but the rest of it is a perfectly reasonable Euro. Can't imagine playing it with my gaming group, because there are so many other choices, but with family or non-gamers? A solid choice.

My first proper board game (who would have guessed). Classic, fun to break out every once in a while, but the base game is quite dry after so many plays. Usually, winners are decided by 1) the initial placement or 2) unpredictable dice rolls. There are those few games where a particularly clever player whips out a combo of moves to rocket to 10 points unexpectedly, but usually the winner is quite clear early on.

I first played at Gen Con when I was substantially younger.

I like that you have to pay attention during other turns, and that it's not a hurry up and wait mechanic.  I like the balance of the different construction options, and the different ways to score points.  However, I've always won the same way- build the longest road, use it to spread out your villages and harness needed resources ports, and once you're out of villages and have your empire in the right position, build it up to cities.  The only exceptions are when you need a city for more wood or brick to build more roads or villages.

I don't like the kingmaker aspect, and that poor strategic decisions by losing players can hand victories to other players (When 'don't give him a brick, that's all he needs to win' is ignored).  I've benefited from this before, but I don't know that deceit belongs here.  

 Maybe next time I play I'll gun for 'largest army' and VP cards, even though I've never seen it work.

Luck is a fine element in games, but the luck in this game can left you with nothing to do for several rounds and made you feel hopeless. Negotiation is another 'random' thing as it drags the game and whether to trade or not can be something not rationalized for certain players. It's still a good gateway for new boardgamers to understand certain boardgame concepts to facilitate teaching of more difficult games, but I can't really see the point of going back to Settlers once they've learned 'better' games.

RATING: 7.8
A trading game that is very fun to play, the robber can be a bit dull, but after reading online a good variant may be to not take a card from someone else when rolling a 7, but perhaps get to take a card that you would like from the bank.

That rule alone takes out exactly what is problematic with the game and the back-stabby nature of that rule. Otherwise, the game is fun, not too long, but also it is something that can be played with anyone as it's easy to explain.

WISHLIST: This game (and the expansion) would be a good game to own because everyone knows it.  I don't think the game itself is bad, I just don't think it lives up to the hype that some people give it.  However, it is an excellent introduction to eurogames for new gamers.

As is the case for many, Catan was my first modern board game, and I loved it. I still do, even if playing it often leaves me a bit on the frustrated side. For the most part a very well designed game, the only complaint I have about Settlers is the pronounced role of luck, given that your ability to carry out any strategy is largely contingent on rolls of the dice. You can position yourself in theoretically the perfect position, but if you don't get the dice rolls, you don't get the goods. Within the scope of my experience, it is unusual for a game to seem to require so much strategy while having that strategy contingent on so very much good fortune.

I play Settlers every week (that means every time we play, since our meeting is once a week). After all these times I have played it I lowered my rating from 8 to 6. I just hate (more and more every time) that one decision at the start of the game (initial placing of settlements/roads) can decide the winner, together with the luck of dice. Even if you play with a standard initial placement (booooooooriiiiiiiiiiiiing) you are screwed if the other players leave you out of the negotiations.

A 6 only for how often it hits the table.

I have been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride with Settlers.  Like many others, this was the first Euro-style board game that I played, and it opened my eyes to a whole new way to game and a whole new type of game to play.  For that alone, it holds a special place in my heart.  I played this game almost exclusively for a year or more, and then became burned out on it.  There was a point when I didn't want to play it anymore.  But now that I play it with much more moderation, my opinion of it has increased again.  It has some great strategic decisions when it comes to placing your initial pieces, and the player interaction and replayability are fantastic.

You are certainly at the mercy of the dice in this game, and it is also possible that a player who is not winning can suffer when the other players jump on the leader, merely by sharing a space or two with the leader.  The game is not perfect, and sometimes a particular session just falls flat.  But the fact is that this is a great gateway game with a lot of strategy and a good dose of fun.  In reasonable amounts, it is quite enjoyable.

When it was made, Catan was a groundbreaking, interesting, beautiful, and unique game. There are some parts of the game I appreciate. I like the artwork, the trading, the cover and the font. However, I almost never enjoy playing this game. Catan is a grueling game that just makes people frustrated and angry at one another. In addition, the game is largely decided on starting position and dice rolls. I also feel as though there aren't many strategic in-game decisions. You mostly just build what you can given the resources you were lucky enough to get. The game is not deeply strategic at all. Once you know how to play this game (having played at least 5 times), your not at a big disadvantage to someone who considers them self a Catan master. And that wouldn't bother me except that so many people think that this game is so deeply strategic. Another aspect that frustrates me is depending on the board, sometimes you are screwed from the very start of the game, which then makes it hard to put on a happy face and finish. I will say this game is very satisfying to win, because of all the built up emotions throughout the game. "Oh c'mon I've been screwed by the robber all game!", "that's a horrible trade, you realize she is going to win the game now!", "Wow, you've gotten so lucky with those 10s, I wonder if we are ever going to roll a fricken 5!" . Klaus is an evil genius. No matter how frustrating this game is, he got people addicted to playing it even if it risks the health of important friendships. No matter how much Catan frustrates me, I can't hate this game, because this is the board game that got me in to board games, and for that I am forever thankful. And this game has paved the way for all the awesome new games we see today.

(After 5 Plays) 10/12/16: Catan is a game I enjoy quite a bit. It was one of the first games I played (like many others on the site), but I don't like it simply for nostalgias sake. There is some real strategy here. Yes, there is randomness which some wont like but it doesn't take away from the fun. Its a game that is light enough to just enjoy your time with it win or lose. It has been surpassed by other games which is why its score has dipped some but its one I'm always willing to play.

This game pulled me back to the board gaming world, after a pause of almost 20 years. Playing it for the first time in December 2013 and was fascinated by its simplicity yet elegant gameplay. It was definitely a 10 for me as a new gamer who just (re)entered this paper gaming world.

After so many plays during the past years, I started playing other games and was exposed to much more complex and eye-openning gameplay mechanisms. So, I (as an experienced casual gamer) updated The Settlers of Catan as an 8.

I really loved this game when I first played it - and I continued to love it for a couple of years. Nowadays, I only play it if it's the only available game, or if other people are insisting. Although the game has a bit of complexity in it, I find it to be a little bit too depending on luck. Also - if you get "trapped" and can't expand, the game gets boring as you're completely deprived of possibilities to do anything at all. 

It's a good game (along with Carcassonne and Ticket to ride) to introduce new people to boardgames, before moving on to heavier games - but that's about it.

Nice light euro game. One of the prime examples probably. Better trading game than most games that rely on trading.

[b]Settlers of Catan[/b] - Slovenian Edition (3rd 2007)

2-4 players (5-6 with expansion)

Has seen countless plays. Great game. I suppose my opinion might not last forever, its sheen may dull, but when? If one plays too often? It has been fun on a consistent basis, and am almost always willing to play it, which I cannot say for all games.

[b]The Pros[/b]
-lots of player interaction due to negotiation/diplomacy/trading 
-usually little down time (use a timer when playing with slow players!)
-opponents' plans can be disrupted in various ways
-multiple paths to victory
-multiple game variants (expansions)
-modular board =every game will be different
-very easy to learn
-not an overlong game, allowing 2 or more games to be played in one game night evening

[b]The Cons[/b]
Some might complain about the usage of dice. If dice are not your thing, you could use a [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/20038/catan-event-cards]dice deck[/url] to replace them. It is included within the event cards in [thing=27760][/thing].

However, I think luck usually doesn't play a major role. The "randomness" of the dice roll doesn't automatically mean luck rules this particular game.

For one, the usage of two dice lessens the randomness, making some number totals more statistically probable than other totals (ex. totals of six are much more probable than totals of two, because there are more possible combinations of the dice rolls. Whereas 3 and 3, 1 and 5, 4 and 2 all equal 6, only 1 and 1 equal 2). See: http://wizardofodds.com/gambling/dice/

As you gain experience, you learn to avoid building on those provinces, which will statistically provide less resources. A frequent mistake committed by novices. And if the best provinces have already been taken during the initial setup, an experienced player knows how to use the sea ports to his advantage (exchanging resources 2:1 or 3:1).

Even if one player does indeed have more luck with the dice, and beats the statistic probability overwhelmingly, this usually tends to balance itself out: 1) with the other players creating alliances against him, 2) with the brilliant Robber mechanism, which steals from those too rich with resources, 3) the clever usage of sea ports, and 4) trading with your allies as much as possible. The key is to make those trades, which benefit you more than your opponent.

A degree of randomness challenges one's ability in adapting to changing circumstances. Real life is all about this. But for those who do not like it, there are always the dice cards mentioned above.

Whereas strategy is the overall plan, tactics are the actual means used to gain an objective. This game has both. But of course this is not one of the heavy, deep or complex games, which I do like as well.

This was my gateway game. I first played when my cousin brought it to a family reunion in 2000. I have never been the same since.  I still have it in part due to nostalgia.

Good for a beginner game, but I feel that there are better introduction games for new players. 

I think my biggest knock on the game is that it is normally just my wife and myself playing games, which makes it difficult to play Catan. Then when we do have a large group, it just takes too long to play a 6 player game of Catan.

This is one of the most accessible games for new players and it works well: rules are quick and easy to learn while players interact and have a great social time. However, with experience you can sometimes identify early who will win and who has no chance at all (having been blocked or no resource income). This is because the game does suffer from the luck factor; you always have one or two high probability numbers being rolled with extremely low frequency and vice versa. Whoever benefits over this first has a massive advantage. Also I often find my turns boring as the dice dictate what you are going to do most of the time; only ever receive wood and brick? Roads for you! I didn't want a road....! The game can also be overly long with experienced players, as at some point people will not trade, inhibit the current leader from winning and continue a long battle for largest army /longest road. Lastly, depends on the group, but the robber is used as vengeance for some people, for out of game reasons. Very frustrating especially if the person robbed was already coming last. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent. Can't say more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Once you've played this enough, it gets a little boring in my opinion, partially because you have a solid strategy and can win most of the time against less experienced, so you're just going through the motions. Against equally skill opponents, it depends who was targeted more by the robber and who got better rolls.

The dice roles can also affect a bit, and between 2 equal players, the dice will determine the game. Its a decent starting/gateway game I suppose but some level of gaming maturity is needed. Negotiation and trading makes it low/no downtime which I really love, but even so, there's just not enough control/variety for me to rate this higher. TBH, I haven't found a game that does the negotiation/trading so well in tandem while maintaining gameplay, but it must exist somewhere, so I really hope to find something better/more fulfilling than this game (if you know such a game, please tell me!). I also kind of think that the original game should just be 3-6P default and not have to need an expansion. And yes, I do like this at 5/6P counts since its more trading and more dynamic, even if the game stalls a bit more.

"after years of play its appeal is starting to diminish, the dice, the dice, it brings to much randomness even if I love the bargain aspect and the confrontational aspects."

[edit/update]: Played this last week after a couple of years on the shelf. A complete shock. It was terrible, boring, runaway leader, standstills and a stench of randomness. So we played it again - surely it was a better game than this according to the memories. It wasn't. The hobby owes a lot to this game but games have evolved a heck of a lot in 15 years and this game is a reminder of that. Sadly this is one of the worst euro games in my collection. A classic, yes; a good game in 2008, no.

Good negotiation game.  Luck based, but doesn&#039;t seem to matter much, except for longest game ever (2+ hours).  Can get draggy sometimes, but is nice and good.  Novice game, not beginner.  You have to have some interest in gaming before you start.  Classic and highly recommended.

I enjoy this game, but it is rather based on luck. Depending on who (if anyone) the dice favor, you can rack up points quickly, or sit around trying to trade your lone Brick for anything, anything at all. 

I've tried a couple different strategies with Catan and it seems that you can win from just about any position, unless the dice are being brutal. With even semi-decent placement you can usually trade for what you need or just buy Dev cards to improve your hand.

All in all, this is a fun game and a good gateway game.

This is the game that introduced me to the boardgaming hobby. I enjoy the negotiations and "trade embargos" that develop from this game. There is a fair amount of luck involved and even a sound strategy might faulter due to dice rolls or unfair trades. I will always pick a different game to bring to the table, but have always enjoyed the times that others suggest we play this game.

Classic gateway game of picking territories and numbers and hoping the dice are nice to you. More luck based than most strategy games as early game rolls can make or break the game if they are more than a little unbalanced. Still quick and fun.

RATING: 6
There's really just too much luck involved for me to take this game as seriously as others do. You can stack the odds in your favor and still lose, while the player with the two dot ore mines becomes some sort of mining baron. Sure it's fun, but how many times can you replay it? Maybe it just seems tame in comparison to Diplomacy or Traders of Genoa where the negotiation aspects of the game are far more developed.

Only one play to date (and a win at that) - rating could move a point or two in either direction, but a great first experience.

The only knock is that, looking back, I played this as a pure abstract - the theme was non-existent in my head.  Maybe that's why I won?

RATING: 6.2
Rarely hits the table these days, but I'm a fan of this game and am disappointed that it  seems to have fallen out of favor with many. Perhaps in the avalanche of so many spin-offs, variations and spiritual successors people have lost sight of the original game. Or maybe it's a yardstick by which people measure their gamer cred? In any case, this is a great example of how a few simplified, interlocking mechanisms can add up to more than the sum of parts. I do tend to play with the "welfare" variant to speed things up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoy the resource management and trading that this game offer.  However; the charm of this game has waned for me over repeated plays.  I still enjoy it, but the rating has suffered a bit for me.  I would rarely slap this game on the table to play, but if invited I would rarely say no.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good game concept but quality of workmanship is low. Pieces warp quickly even when bagged and played in a low-moisture environment. This makes assembly of the board challenging and frustrating - moreso the more often it is played. Aside from that, Catan uses a relatively simple game mechanic that is easy to pick up on and fun to play. Best played with 4 players in order to maximize the trading/barter features and competition.

I decide to use this game to encourage my colleagues to play game and it is worked!!! Since then, we usually have gaming night 2-6 times a month. Even though, Catan don't come back to the table that frequent, it has special place in my mind :D

While miles better than most of the Milton-Bradley/Hasbro/Parker-Brothers line-up that form the popular culture board game canon, Catan is nevertheless long, painful, too grossly random to stand up next to other similar economy-building games.

Catan is a good game that has been around forever.  I've only played the Star Trek version in real life (which I didn't really dig) but played the app on my phone a LOT when I was first getting into board games.  I can see why it is so popular but I feel that in recent years there are many games that offer more in theme and gameplay.  One I wouldn't mind owning just because it seems I should, but not one I really think, I would like to play a game of Catan right now.

Nowhere as amazing as I thought it was when I first played it all those years ago, but still a half decent game.  I refuse to play with more than 4 players, though.  Just bogs down too much.  I think Cities and Knights improves it for me.  Rarely play any version these days.  Probably my main beef is the dependence on the good will of others, which I rarely get since I have a reputation of winning too many games.

I think the game is OK, but I'm not partial to the swinginess - luck has a huge role. On average, a presumably decent number like 5 or 9 will not be rolled a single time 1 out of 8 or so games. The last game I played, 47% of the rolls were 3, 4, or 6 which heavily favored the ultimate winner. I can definitely tell who the better players are in our group because they _tend_ to win more, but if the dice don't cooperate, well, skill alone doesn't win the game. Too random for my taste.

An excellent multiplayer, social game with a nice balance of skill/luck (i.e. enough depends on skill that you have to plan your strategy well, but luck can kill a great strategy).  For a game that depends less on luck, use a dice/roll deck.  Also, to blance games have the best player/winner go first, with worst/last place playing last.

I have not played expansions, but look forward to trying them.

There was a day when I would have giving this game a much higher rating, but that was way back in the early days of my German game collection.  Having played the heck out of this game (and its expansions) I have come to dread both the foolish die roll that determines the fate of all players and the usually painful trade phase that I must suffer through.  I guess I have developed a dislike for trade games, having seen far too many foolish and game-breaking trades in my day.

I still think it's a classic game and would be happy to play, but the game runs longer than I'd like for the weight of decisions to be made.

Needs to be something played socially, with an emphasis on making trades fun, to be enjoyable now. Cities and Knights is quite interesting, but moves to epic length. Seafarers is longer without the benefit or more interesting choices.

Expansions owned:
* The Cities and Knights of Catan (English third edition) (2000)
* The Seafarers of Catan (Mayfair Third Edition) (1998)
* The Great River (2005)
* The Fishermen of Catan (2005)

[WrenniePennie's copy]
The title that got me back into board gaming, and is very much like comfort food for me. Some of the mechanics that encourage resource hoarding seem antiquated and unbalanced nowadays, and the dice rolling, in hindsight, causes strategic placement and luck to crash rather than flow together, making resource-generating a frustrating affair for some members of the game. However, the random generation of land masses, building, and competitive factor in trading still make this one fun to play.

RATING: 6
At first I was really taken with everything about the game but, after a few plays, I've found it is an excellent game let down by its ending. You spend a lot of time building and trading until suddenly someone has ten points and thats it. At least with games when you count at the end you have a bit of suspense.

22 years. It took 22 years for me to finally get a chance to play this game. Despite its age, The Settlers Of Catan still holds up. Yeah, I could see having too many of the same resource being clumped together during setup cause balance issues, but that is a minor quibble. Trading, points for victory, a minor screw-your-opponent ability, and an innovative dice roll payout mechanics; its no wonder that tSoC took the world by storm and ushered in an era of interest in Euro board gaming.

There are so many versions of tSoC and expansions for the game, but were I ever to buy it, I would probably stick to the vanilla version as 3-4 players is probably the best for game length and a theme change doesn't interest me.

Oh, and despite the official shortening of the game to just 'Catan', I will probably always refer to it by its full title as it evokes memories of the reverence people held for The Settlers Of Catan in the late 90's.

I do not understand why this game is so much more appropriate for people to play than Monopoly.  You still are at the mercy of the dice and you can haggle your way into money/VPs.  

If faced with playing Settlers or Monopoly I suppose I would choose Settlers, however I still feel they are not that hugely different. The only reason this game gets more praise is because of the unnecessary hatred towards Monopoly.  I rate this higher because it is new to me and people in my life are less aware of it.

This game is the game that introduced me to euro gaming, to modern board games, and to what I can easily say, one of my favourite hobbies. The gameplay is enjoyable, it has strategy, it has trading (which we actually use), it is extremely easy to learn as well as teach. Not much to say than an excellent choice as a gateway game. The only issue is it's player count. I really can't get this to the table because most of my gaming is done solo or as two players.

Note: This game has been played several times before I started logging plays.

RATING: 5.5
Not sure if I can go back to base game after Cities & Knights. The unusual mechanism for gathering resources was revolutionary, but the downsides glare (to wit, the SOL/overpower factor if the initial positions are unbalanced; 4p game can last FOREVER if too many settlement/city positions are built 3 vertices apart). Pretty good replay value by comparison to its gateway peer (Carcassonne). 
----
I did go back to the base game for a quickie... it was tolerable because it was shortened to 7 points.

A classic and a good game. Can get stale and is often boring if you're playing with people who aren't fun to play with. It's very simple with some interesting strategy, though, and it's a great game to introduce people to board gaming with.

RATING: 8
The one that started it all. I have played many many games of Settlers and have had a great deal of fun. I can play this with almost anyone and most everyone will get a kick out of the game. If you wanna get people into board games, this is a great place to start. That said, now that I have somewhere over a 100 games played, I can see where others have fault with it. It can go on long easily, many games feel like they have been rigged against you, and after many plays it can feel like going through the motions. It's still one of my favorite games, and I think it's more strategic than it's given credit for, and even if things turn sour early, you can still have a chance to win. Still a big fan.

Edit: I am not dropping the score even though Catan drives me up a bit of a wall now. If I got 100 plays of Catan, then I think it is at least worth an 8.

One of the games that brought me back to the table.  It's a little random, and that's what I like about it: Deal with what you're dealt and negotiate for the rest.  It's no brain-burner.  It's as friendly or as confrontational as you make it.  And it's one of the few games I can get the whole family to play.

Colonizadores de Catan foi o primeiro jogo mais "avançado" que eu conheci depois dos populares. A premissa é simples: construa seus vilarejos em junções de terrenos e ganhe os recursos daqueles terrenos caso os dados colaborem. Parece muito dependente de sorte mas, acreditem, a estratégia pode fazer bastante diferença. Recomendo muito para quem começar a conhecer este mundo.

A great gateway game and played it a lot in the past. Its an older edition of the game.(1996 3rd edition?)

These days however, I feel that in the majority of games you can pretty much predict who will win from the setup.  Then it's just dying a slow death waiting for that outcome.

RATING: 6.5
My gateway game, just like so many people's. I can barely play the base game now - too dependent on starting position and luck of the dice. It just seems like every game someone gets in a bad place early and can't ever make headway. Worst of all, the mechanics simply aren't deep enough to support the time investment. I hear the expansions are better but there are many games I'd rather play.

RATING: 9
I was juggling between 8 and 9 for Settlers. Technically, I think the game deserves a 9 for being elegantly simple and always fun to play. I eventually bumped it up to a 9 for the game's uncanny ability to draw non-gamers into the Eurogame genre. I am one of those converts myself.

RATING: 8
Vanilla Settlers is a good gateway game. I would recommend it with 3-4 people at most. Some people argue that luck plays too much a role, but I really think that it depends on the group of people you play with. A quiet non-negotiating group will play very differently than one where everyone is offering quick and clear trades. I've played the game for years, and I think that in many ways, although luck plays a role, the skill lies in assembling wins in spite of bad rolls or bad initial placement.  I think the game suffers more from the ability for a player to play kingmaker.

For gamers who desire something more complex, I would recommend playing with the Cities and Knights expansion, which adds more ways to win, while retaining the core mechanics.

The gateway game, Catan is a modern classic. Trading resources keeps everyone involved and offers high interaction between players. It looks simple but under surface it offer surprisingly deep gaming experience. Only reason why I usually wouldn't suggest Settlers in a gaming night is the fact there are games I haven't played as much and want to try them instead. Better with 4 players, I'd rather play something else with 3.

Update (15.5.2009) : My rating for Catan has shifted between 6-9 during my time on BGG. (Rating of 6 was when I had overplayed). Right now it feels that because of intense gaming experiences (when played with 4 players) it offers every time when you play it, it deserves at _least_ a rating of 9.

A good game with a high element of luck. It provides enough screwage and player interaction, mostly in the form of trading, to keep the game interesting. The modular board allows every game played to be slightly different from all the others, greatly increasing its replay value.A great gateway game. In fact, this is the one that introduced me (along with many others) to the other EuroTitles. So, rock on Settlers, rock on.

Roughly 100 plays between 1995 and 2007. Was the game we used to play many fridays with 4 friends. Almost always played with the knights expansion. Have played the sea expansion but much prefer the knights one. Never play this game without at least one or two expansions.
Between 2007-2015 still played but much less frequent as other games have taken over.

Have played this game with 5 and 6 a handfull of times, don't like it with that many players.

Me gusta jugarlo de vez en cuando pero no me entusiasma. Es un juego muy familiar con un pelín de estrategia y uno de los juegos ideales para iniciar a los amiguetes en este mundo.

This was probably the game that finally got me addicted to this hobby. I bought a few other games before this one but my collection exploded after I got Settlers. Haven't played for a while now but would not turn down a chance to play. It's also a great game to get your non-gaming friends into the hobby. I have the German Edition now because I wanted the nice bits but couldn't afford the $500 plus price tag for the 3D treasure chest version.

RATING: 6
I played all the time online, finally got to play in person.  The game is a bit too much luck based for me (I need luck in a game to really enjoy it, but this game is like 90% luck).

It's fun with the family, but it really feels like anyone can win at any time.  Because the robber can seriously cripple people with a lead (and more times than not the table will roll 7's like crazy and if you were the first one in a large lead, they'll just destroy you and not even realize when others are in the lead).  It's funny, but frustrating when you're on the ugly side of it.

So, fun for the family (so long as no one's a sore loser), but not a gamer's game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Fun game, different every time, good player interaction, excellent gateway game for newbies; but very random, and hard to stop an early leader.  

This is the game that got me back into boardgaming, circa 1996, when I started graduate school.  Thus, it has a lot of sentimental value for me.  Probably the game I have played the most in my lifetime, with Cosmic Encounter a close second.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
One of the most influential board games ever, Die Siedler is unfortunately becoming dated - other games have used the nifty ideas that made this such a blast (modular board, all players benefitting from one player's actions, combination of several ways to gain resources with building and negotiating) without incurring the same mistakes (a poor initial layout spells doom no matter how hard you try, winning players getting so much advantage after the start that the last half hour is just waiting for the kill). The replayability of the game can be raised if you add on some of its multiple expansions (choosing which one can be quite fastidious for non-hardcore fans of the game, though).

Overall, Die Siedler is another one of the classics everyone should have played at least once -being as popular as it is, it shouldn't be difficult to find it at a friend's-, but it's actually bigger for its influence than for the game itself.

I doubt there's a lot I can say about this that hasn't always been said. A classic, a gateway, but still peculiarly requested by fans of the oblique and the obscure. But yet, I really really enjoy it every time it comes out. Classic? Or nostalgia? Who cares - there's a spark here that is close to timeless.

The one major gripe is that an initially poor position could end the game right there and then for you. Being fourth to speak on an unfavourable layout means you'll be playing catch-up all the time.

The introductory Euro-game for me and the one which has achieved the best penetration amongst my non-gaming friends. Evidence: We hosted a Settlers tourney at our house with 24 players, and none of those people with the exception of myself owns a game invented since 1980.

Settlers has many attractive elements to it. The easy lingo, the constant engagement created by the resource-generation system, and the cute little network that you build are some standout features that are very appreciated by new players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great fun, very well balanced. 

Tactics are important, and the role of luck is minimised as in this game you make your own luck by being aware of probabilities. 

The trading element is good fun, as you bargain with opponents and cut deals.  There are also various ways to go about winning, so you can try different approaches each time - especially as the board is made up differently each game forcing different strategies.

Wow... what can i say, one day in college i went to my friends house and had my first "go" at this game... and it opened the door to everything else. catan is the gateway game to be certain

so i learned this game "in person" the way it was meant to be played... it is soooooo much better that way, but it does take a while to set up... i think that this game is the perfect game to intoduce your friends who arn't board gamers into the genre

the reason "in person" is better is that skill level is leveled out through trading... if 2 novices play with an expert, the novices will team up to give themselves a chance...

as you may be able to tell I've also played online. one day my 2 catan buddies and i were playing catan, and we decided to see if there was and "online" version... WAS THERE EVER... it was cool because we just used the internet version to facilitate our gameplay... everything else stayed the same, but we were able to instantly have a new map and new scenarios... somthing that would take 10+ minutes in person (also there was realtime scoring)

in addition to that, the internet community had the cities and knights expansion built in (1st time seeing that)...which i enjoy FAR more...

so after "discovering" catan online, we all became closet catan players... i would literally play catan for 12 hours straight always playing "just one more game" the difference about playing online is that trading is so less personal, and that it become just another function.... games go extreemly fast, and everyone you play against has a great understanding for the tactics... I developed extreemly good tactics this way, but eventually I overdosed. 


I can still play catan, but now that i understand it so well, it's not as fun for me to play... everything seems too "random"

I highly recomend this game for anyone that hasn't OD'd on it... please play it in person a few time first though, The internet community is BRUTAL for people who are "slow" or inexperienced

A bit underrated here. It is a great game and only handicap is if all your rivals play aganist you you cannot beat them all. They can trade in themselves and they can stop trading with you.

This is a great game that I bought years ago, before ever becoming a "gamer."  I had heard good things about it (can't remember where) and bout it, despite not really having any gamer friends (much less two, so that we could play this).  Since then, I have had a chance to get into this game, and I love it because it's like a different game every time we lay out the tiles...  EDIT: Pales in comparison to Keythedral.

You've got to respect what Settlers did for the hobby. I would usually rather play something else, but if I'm in a group of Settlers die-hards or it's offered up I'll go along with it. There's not a lot of downtime as you are involved in everyone's turn, it plays relatively quickly (though 20 minutes too long IMO), and scales nicely.

Oeh, not getin why there's still hype for this game. Dice brakes this game for me. Its probably better the more you play as there has to be something in it. I'd probably love it had I played it before other stuff, now it just - is that it?

Thanks to Monica and Lucian, this game and Agricola are what got me back into board gaming and away from video games. I'll still play Street Fighter, but I love inviting people to play this and other games at my house.

Seriously, guys, thank you.

Update: this rating went down because, after starting board game nights at work, I realize that the only version I want to play is Cities and Knights.

I just don't get this game. The randomness, the boredom... Even having your villages in good spots you can end up having very few cards and nobody wanting to trade. And there is nothing engrossing in the play. Every turn is so alike. I seriously don't understand why this game is so popular. Surely not for me.

Not a bad game. The problem to have it is that every new gamer have heard about it, talks to you about it and tries to convince you to play; so with the time, i'm starting to get sick of Catan (Even when I play once a year at most)

My re-introduction to board gaming. Plays like a dream with 4, nice level of player interaction and while prone to AP, the overall playing time does not feel that much.

I was dead excited about this game when it came out - Arcane magazine gave it 10/10!  Well, it 'aint that good, but it's certainly a good game.  One of my favourite German style games infact and one of the few games I own that my girlfriend actually asks to play.

RATING: 7
Stop being a snob: SETTLERS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOARD GAMES OF ALL TIMES, because it does extremely well what a game is supposed to do: It brings people together, no matter if you personally like it or not. It's definitely not perfectly designed for the mechanical point of view, it's too short, dice rolls decide... Yes. True. But it's the most social board game I know, and that's why people love it. I'd probably rate it a 10 if there wasn't the "Cities and Knights" expansion.

[b]Catan[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]UPDATE:[/COLOR]

[i]Unfortunately I haven't had the opportunity to play this again, so I don't have anything new to add. I've decided against getting a copy, I already have too many games to play with my family that are best with four so I'll just have to wait to play again.[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]So it took four years in the hobby before I finally got a chance to play Catan and although it now seems to be easily dismissed, I found it to be great fun. I think it would still be a great gateway into the hobby since it feels familiar to games most people have played while also introducing player interaction via trading. Personally TTR would still be my gateway game of choice, but I'll probably pick up a copy of Catan because I think it'll be a hit in my house and with our extended family.[/i]

Game that brought me into the hobby. Generally will give this a pass with just the base game. Too much luck with what tiles produce. I respect it though for its influence on the hobby. There are just a lot of other games I would rather play. I can be tempted though with the Cities and Knights expansion. That one gives the game more interesting choices in my opinion.

I have a love-hate relationship with Catan. The luck element seems poorly placed. When I am spending a great deal of downtime waiting for my turn, only to lack the resources to do anything, I secretly get frustrated. And on the flipside, when things are going well, I often feel guilty that there's almost invariably at least one player at the table in the crappy position I am loathe to be in. It's the fact that the luck element affects the degree of player choice, oftentimes down to passing out a whole turn that seems broken to me. Will likely play it again on the rare occasion, as my copy and all its expansions went to my brother.

I really like Catan for what it is.  It is a great gateway game for new gamers and a nice introduction to euros, and I have enjoyed most of the times I have played it.  However, when I play with a group of all experienced gamers, it doesn't hit the table as much.  The luck factor brings the game down a notch, IMO.

I finally got to play this game which I have heard glowing reports of for so long. It has good quality components and nice artwork. Chance plays a big role in the game, but good resource management decisions are key. I enjoyed the interactions that came of players being permitted to exchange resources. The main drawbacks of the game are that it takes a long time to set up, and it lasts too long.  Update: I am less enchanted with this game the more I play it and must lower my rating.  It's too slow-moving and repetitious for me.  (2+2)

Of course I've known about this game for years, but after finally playing it (Feb. 2009), I found it intriguing, even though prior to playing I had a hard time understanding how a game of this sort could be interesting. There is much to think about, it's more competitive (and even a bit more cutthroat) than I imagined, and it's well balanced and can be tense. I'd agree with those who say this game has earned a place on department store shelves next to stuff like "Clue," "Monopoly," and "Sorry." In that regard, I'm happy to see games like "Heroscape" "Axis & Allies" and "Blokus" on such shelves. Too bad other new standards like "Scotland Yard," "Carcassonne" and "Ticket to Ride" aren't also there regularly. [Note: As of 2012 I'm seeing more of these new standards on shelves in stores like Target.] I bought "Settlers of Catan" for a friend and his 14-year-old son: he couldn't figure it out, so I took it back home with me (they live way out of town) and taught myself. Then, when my friend next visited (June 2009), I taught him and he took it back. That's one way to do it! As to whether I might buy my own copy of this, to date (April 2010) I haven't yet, and I'm guessing I won't, simply because there are many other games more interesting to me. But to repeat, this is a seminal game and definitely has its place in the pantheon of outstanding games. Since of my sons got into gaming after going to college and learned how to play "Settlers..." I figured my family would play it so I traded for a copy of the 4th Edition, December 2014.

One snow week in January 2011 we had a week of playing the classics (Settlers, Alhambra, Princes of Florence, and Louis XIV). We pulled Settlers off the shelf and played it again. We had a great time relearning the rules and enjoying the game again. 

The game is a simple medium weight game. The game is very luck driven due to the roll of the die and resource collection.

This game has a great balance of elements, which makes it a lot of fun. It has variation (with the random board) which keeps it fresh, good player interaction (with trading) and luck! It's a great game to teach and it's almost always a success which is indicative of what a great game it is.

The play count on this is way off--the 3 plays since the beginning since the beginning of 2007 reflect my rapid acquisition of new games that I like better.  We played the crud out of this from 2004-2006, especially with the Cities and Knights expansion.

It's still OK, but kind of slow to me for the enjoyment I get out of it.  We never really explored Seafarers much...maybe I will some time in the future.  I won't ever get rid of this I think, but I'm content to only play it every few years.

Very easy to learn and fun to play. But I am not willing to give this one more than 6, since the early game and game length can drag on a bit.

Good trading and gateway game. Some replay value, but gets boring if you play it too much. I burned out on this when I took it to Australia. I took a bit of a break from this game in 2005/2006 academic year, but since Autumn 06 I got back into it, then burned out again, and doubt I'll be keen to play it again since I realised how high the randomness really is. Also it is slightly too long. The game can get boring if your numbers aren't coming up.

Settlers is best with 4. 3 or 5 means it's too easy to expand, 5-6 is too slow. I think the expansions all make the game worse.

It was my first Euro. I also now realise that there is too much luck - early luck gets compounded, and players can be out of contention after 10 minutes (or 0 minutes if they put their 2 settlements in stupid places). Also it is kind of the same every time - there's only a few ways to get points so you end up doing the same things every game. Or every few games I suppose: you might get longest road one game, and largest army + VP cards the next, but there's not much strategy space to explore. Funny I'm saying this now, when I first played it I was impressed by all those multiple paths to victory.

Another issue I have is that 50% of the skill/important decisions in the game are the setup initial placement. After that the dice tell you what you should be building. The trading phase keeps me engaged because you have to pay attention and negotiate with the other players (that's the best part of the game), the robber and competition for longest road are good aspects.

These days when I see a bunch of Settlers-ers setting up, I like to watch the initial placement and then predict who will win based on resource access. More often than not I am right.

A must-have game. Lots of interaction between players, and strong luck and strategic factors make this game, in my opinion, the best one to introduce non-gamers. The rules are easy to explain. The downside is that one tends to get tired of it after repeated play.

Bring it to the table if you want to infect friends with the gaming disease. Some may say that Ticket to Ride or whatever modern light game is better for introducing non-gamers to the world of gaming but the trading in Settlers makes it so, that there is lots of table talk. Ticket to Ride can be a fairly quiet affair. So while TTR and other games might be more modern designs, the table talk from settlers makes it the better gateway game for me.

I've played this game more than the number of plays would indicate.  At first it was exciting, fresh, and seeing if you got more resources each turn was addictive.  However, with repeated plays the power of the dice becomes apparent and the fun factor wore down quickly.  I've played this dozens of times at this point, and while I'll play again if asked, I prefer games with more opportunity for decision-making and strategy (like Agricola).

Luck can have an impact (alleviated by the poverty variant), but it's proven very replayable over time. I've played most of the expansions, but the relative simplicity of the original has provided lasting appeal. Attractions include the building theme, the sociability of the trading, and the requirement to carefully consider risk and probabilities. All of which adds up to an engaging and enjoyable experience.

RATING: 6.5
It is as good a gateway game as ticket to ride - especially because it has been mainstream for a while.  But I am not crazy about the player interaction.  I've had some annoying games where people manipulate others in trades or just give away their cards for next to nothing near the end of the game if they feel they are not going to win.  Granted, that is a problem with the group.  But it still makes this one group-dependent for me.

Kudos to my gateway game. I wish I knew of and had games like this growing up; now my kids and their kids do/will. This is the game that cut my teeth on quality games designed with various methods of earning  victory points.

I consider this to be the second REAL game I've ever played (second to Can't Stop). Though I rarley pull it out now, I still keep it because it is a very appealing gateway game, full of great art and components; still this game is not the perfect surefire gateway game for all situations.

The 4th Edition rulebook is terrible. Though the glossary is cool, because the emphasis was on the glossary instead of the rules, the rules seems overcomplicated or difficult to find.

Don't like the robber. 

Don't like that 90% of trades are one-for-one, with an occasional 2-for-1. (Would be much more interesting if you could regularly trade 4-for-3, for example. 0% vs. 100% markup is too big of a jump.

Don't like that the game is so long for what it is. 

Basically, it's a mediocre game that has a long history. It should probably be semi-retired.

Uggggh Catan.  I tolerate playing Catan with 3 or 5 players.  4 and 6 player games usually lead to someone getting boxed in intentionally or accidentally.  Getting screwed over by the dice is a big part of Catan.  Its a decent game for uncompetitive personalities that don't like complicated board games.  

I hear there is at least one version of Catan that does something about the dice gods being jerks to you.  This is not that version however.

Settlers is a good game that I enjoy playing. It has been ignored a bit since I plunged into the gaming hobby and acquired too many games. My wife and I used to play it with friends quite a bit. I do not mind the randomness of the dice rolling. If a game is meant to be fun, I feel that the random chance adds a pleasant bit of tension to Settlers.

RATING: 8
I too was brought into this kind of gaming by Settlers of Catan... Sort of. I was introduced to this game and then bought it, and played it for something like 3 years nonstop. I introduced it to many people and spared the word around, but was never really interested in any of the expansions or any other games. 

In time I learned how big and incredible the world of gaming is, and I left Catan behind. I rarely ever want to play that anymore. Perhaps because I played it so much, I now tend to avoid it since I really have no more interest in 'figuring this game'. 

Nonetheless, I played it so much as if it was the only game in the world.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good intro game.  We play it a lot, to the point where I would rather have other people do the first play with a noobie, so they don't get completely smoked.  Still, a great game, with more strategy then seems apparent, but enough luck for beginners.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
 Settlers started my return into modern boardgaming in 2005. For over a year it was my favourite game. But the more I played it the more annoying the dice were. Finely in 2007 I fed with Settlers up. I remember some games I lost or won only because of luck. Wining was even worse for me. Besides, if you used to play Settlers with the same people all the time you know each reactions enough to make trading very predictable and boring. Event Cards did not help - why should I trade with anybody if I get my resources sooner or later? Now  I play Settlers very occasionaly. I tried even Teuber`s official 2-players variant which is very nice to play baut a bit static.
 If you search for a family game choose rather Carcassonne - shorter, better, very portable, less luck, tactical decisions every turn, short setup, etc.

I manage to do like 2 roads, 1 town... another player just bought Development Cards, actualy we ran out of those. So besites the placement of the hexes, the game can be very dull.

Far too much depends on the initial placement of your 2 settlements.  I hear so much about how trading evens out the dice rolls.  But i do not care what you say, the person getting the most favorable dice rolls has a huge advantage that I do not believe trading can overcome.  Others have said this is one of those rare games that on your turn, you can actually help everyone except yourself.  This happens far more often than it should.  I found this game to be repetitive after about 10 plays and I lost interest.  I dunno, maybe I need to try an expansion?  I doubt I ever will though; too many other games on my list.

The only game where I really approve of the use of dice.  Anyone who's talked to me about board games knows I generally can't stand the amount of randomness using dice introduces to a game, but in this case I feel it's appropriate.  There's no reason to make this mechanic anything more than random, and the bell curve helps influence initial placement.

My first euro-game. I don't think there can be any better introduction to gaming. Over the past few years that I've owned this game I must've played it hundreds of times and it really was the game that started it all.

My friends love playing it and it was great to see how wheeling and dealing our way to success was no longer held to chance or electronically. My immediate family also soon got into it and it's always a good way to have a family evening.

Then I brought it to holiday dinners and Catan was soon being begged for by everyone. It had topped Monopoly and Risk which were two of our classic favorites. 

It was one of the games that helped me forge my gaming group here at school. It's a great introduction into the genre and while lately it hasn't received much play and has lost some of it's luster to newer shinier games Catan will always hold a special place in my heart.

The first "german" game I played. For the longest time, I thought it was without equal but I have since learned otherwise. The random elements can detract from the game at times, as once you are behind you tend to stay behind. This can lead to profuse muttering of curses. Still the standard by which I measure any new game. I have probably spent more time playing this (live or on the net) then any other game.

Uno dei pochi boardgame tedeschi che vendono nei supermercati, e in italiano: gli va quindi reso merito per essere una delle teste di ponte nella diffusione dei german game in Italia. Il gioco ha regole semplicissime, e c'è moltissima interazione tra i giocatori: oltre alla possibilità di sgambetto (col brigante e con la semplice occupazione territoriale) c'è lo scambio di materiali, indispensabile perché all'inizio è difficile essere indipendenti. Il gioco è enormemente influenzato dal fattore-culo (anche se la distribuzione normale dei tiri di dado aiuta chi non si distraeva alle lezioni di statistica), ma rimane godibile e leggero. Da giocare quando si ha fretta - anche se allo scopo ci sono in giro titoli migliori - o per catturare nella spirale dei giochi da tavolo gli amici non praticanti. Nota negativa: nella versione italiana la spiegazione delle regole è demenziale.

Played this game many, many times in the early days of Eurogames in the US.  I came to realize that there's too great of a chance that one player will be screwed over due to initial placement, and so roughly 1/3-1/4th of the games have a player who isn't really playing.  That's a terrible situation.  I actually quite like the game mechanics, but as-is the game is horribly broken and I refuse to play it.

I guess this game was very unique and interesting when it first came out. When I play it it just doesn't grab me. I can think of lots of other games I'd rather play.

I don't think it's a great gateway game I'd use something simpler, like the Ticket To Ride range.

March 2010: This game stands the test of time. I am a proud board gamer due 100% to this game. It just works. It's well designed and has interesting mechanics like negotiation that negates some of the luck factor of dice-rolling. Great gateway game that I'm still happy to play and teach to potential new gamers. Scoring a 9.5 for replayability, longevity, and ease of learning.

I love this game.  Not because it is the best game in the world, it isn't; but because, I can bring it out at a dinner party getting everyone to play it and watch all those, who grew up thinking monopoly was the only game, suddenly start having a fun time. 

Having played hundreds of games of Catan,I don't play that often; but it is my goto game for people who claim that they "don't play board games."

Like most people of my generation, this was the game that introduced me to the hobby game market, so there will always be a special place in my heart for it.  I don't get it to the table much anymore just because it's a bit intense for new players and I've got other gateway games to teach people.  My preference is to only play this with four players who don't mind yelling at each other across the table.  I normally recommend a good coop after we play this to calm everyone back down.  And yes, we still giggle when someone asks, "Does anyone have wood for sheep."

Boring!  Just waiting for dice rolls.. 

Update a few years after my original assessment.  I've fallen in with some dedicated Settlers players, so I've logged more plays.  And I find the game even worse than I remembered.  There are so very many random effects.  And the gang up on the leader with the robber thing.  And so little opportunity for tactical play.  Downgraded from 5 to 4. Nah, it sucks. I'm putting this at 3.

RATING: 9
Settlers of Catan is the classic eurogame of building settlements and cities on the vertices of a hex map in order to produce resources when the numbers on those hexes are rolled.  Not only do you have to manage the probabilities associated with rolling 2d6, but also the types of resources you receive (which build different things) and the spatial aspect of having to build only next to things you already own.  Trading adds another thing to think about in the game, and can help mitigate the dice luck, but also can create player-enforced balance (no one trades with the leader).  After all these years, Settlers is still a favorite of mine.

RATING: 6
This game introduced me to Euro gaming and the entire genre. For that, I suppose I owe Klaus Teuber a debt (which I repaid by buying 4-5 expansions, Das Book, and the $400 "chest" version, plus 2 years on online play, and the Xbox version).

Played perhaps more than any game but Chess and Risk, hundreds of times online and on PC as well. I enjoyed this game, for a long time. Frustrated by poor setups, and bad runs of the dice, my solution was to play it more.

12/11/05 - after over 100 plays on MS site, 20-30 on BSW, and 30+ f-t-f, I am tiring of this game. It has it's place, but I wonder about it's affect now on some folks I've introduced it to. Is it better to get them hooked on PR, or PG? or PoF? I am winning 40+% of my online games, but what does this mean? I am clearly losing some games purely to chance, driving me to play more to counter-act this effect. But when I am winning, are others losing because of chance? How many decisions that I make really are decisions at all?

1/08 Dropping to a 6, but with no disrespect.
1/12 Dropping to a 5. Every year new stuff comes out that improves upon Settlers concepts. I do very much thank Klaus T. for designing this game and bringing me back into the hobby.

9/2014: My rating of 5 is simply my current desire to play. It in no way reflects how important this game was to me and my family. It literally brought me back in to hobby gaming, and had a strong hold on me for 10 straight years. Thanks again Klaus.

RATING: 6
Willing to play when welcoming newbies to the room. Need to engage in active trading to appreciate this game. Need to play this several times in order to make productive trades. If I'm going to play something several times, I'd prefer another game. 
Overall, a decent gateway, and still a clever use of dice. There's a potential for disaster if some of the players have no grasp of the distribution of 2d6. 
EDIT: Thoughts as of 2012. Have you ever noticed just how long it takes to explain this, for a so-called gateway game? Also, it's been around so long that many folks seems to have learned it third- or fourth-hand, which is to say that many unintended house rules have mutated into the gene pool. Earns nostalgia points for having brought many of us into the designer-name-on-the-box world.

A classic for a reason.  Easy to pick up and play, Settlers is guaranteed to provide an hour or two of fun as you collect resources and expand your town.

If you're looking for an in-depth and full-featured experience, though, look elsewhere.  The frequent dice-rolling means players will start complaining about being unlucky (and rightfully so).  Be wary of the expansion packs; while they add some much-needed complexity to the game, some are worth your time more than others.

All in all, Settlers is a casual German-style board game that can be enjoyed with family and friends.

January 2011: This was one of the first boardgames of mine. We played this a lot back then, but now there just are so many better games to play, that this rarely hits the table.

I didn't want to rate this classic game too low, because I love this game if the right conditions are met, and that is it NEEDS the Seafarers expansion. Or another expansion that includes the water tiles, because I enjoy the boating and exploring aspects of the river expansions so much more than the core game. With one of the expansions that includes the water tiles, this is a 9 easy.

Just started playing. Addicted. I want to swap the wheat cards for dairy cards though, I don't eat wheat.

Great game and really intuitive for different players. There is something abstract yet tangible about it. I turned on two friends who I thought might get confused about the rules. But it's pretty simple once you get used to the fact that you don't run around in a circle waiting for everyone else to get bankrupt.

This is our usual go-to family game.  I don't think I've ever won though.  I keep trying different strategies and still haven't found one that works for me, but also beats the other players.

I do enjoy it though.

I love this game, it's my wife's favorite (which is very important since 95% of games I play are 2p vs. her) and all of my friends and family who have played it really like it.  It's simple to teach & learn, offers healthy player interaction (w/out being too nasty), rewards good strategy, and I think it's human nature to enjoy physically constructing little settlements and reaping the benefits.  Many logged plays are the official 2p variant, which is pretty good...  

Includes plays with Seafarers expansion.

While not my favorite game, Catan deserves a spot in board game history for really starting the whole "Golden Age of Boardgaming".  Catan opened up a whole generation to games outside of the Parker brothers millieu.  So many of today's games own their design to some of what Catan has done.  Part area control, part set collection, and of course, the fate of the die rolls.  Catan still is fun to play, it's just that in my opinion, it has long been replaced by other games.

The ultimate gateway game, and the one that brought me into the euro-game fold.  Although it's hard to criticize the solid gameplay mechanics and innovative design, it's also been hard to get Settlers to hit the table with so many other great games now residing on my shelves (including Klaus Teuber's own Domaine, which I greatly prefer to Settlers).  Still a fantastic game for just about anyone, gamer or not.

RATING: 5
Have played this with young kids and they picked it up nicely. There's a variety of strategies to follow and the advantages for the advanced thinker are somewhat mitigated by the dice and the dots on the number-disks. 

I bought this due to its wide popularity as a "gateway" game, and for the fact that so many seemingly hardcore gamers on this site boast about being past it. I'd recommend it as a starter strategy game for those who, like me, are hesitant to buy things with a heavy fantasy theme.

However, there are problems .... the resource cards are fiddly and the robber mechanism is a directed attack, which I think is kind of weak. It's also expensive.

A house "welfare rule" is strongly recommended to keep players interested during times when the dice aren't in favor.

Jó kis építgetős, gyűjtögetős, nyersanyag-kereskedős játék, sok interakcióval. Hátránya a szerencse nagy szerepe a kockák miatt. Hat játékból még csak egyszer sikerült nyernem.
Három játékossal az ideális, mert négyen már nem nagyon férnek el a táblán. 
Kicsit túl hosszúnak is találom - az elején nagyon lassan indul be, amikor még mindenkinek kevés a nyersanyaga, a vége meg túl gyors, amikor már mindenkinek rengeteg termelése van és könnyen vásárol bármit.

This is a great game and gets played often in our group, however, it wasn&#039;t quite a ten. I think that the player who goes first/last during the round in which the settlements are placed is at a high disadvantage. (At least, that seems to be the case in the four-player games.) Also, during some games, you can tell very early on who will be the winner, or at least who will be contenders for the winning spot. If you are not one of the contenders, the game is a real drag and you have to finish out the game.

I finally keeled over and bought this game (2004), primarily because I couldn't resist including Das Buch in my latest order from Germany, and secondly because it's an often requested game that even the average Swede (no, not the vegetable) have some rudimentary knowledge about. 
If all players accept the level of luck involved and the fact that noone will trade one sheep for two ore even if you repeat the request a gazillion times it's acutally a pleasant gaming experience =)

SoC - get the Basic game if you want to introduce someone to boardgaming. It is quite fun, easy to understand and will most likely get you a lifelong boardgamer friend. SoC - Seafarers adds complexity and some more flexibility to the basic game. But What takes the prize is the SoC - Cities and Knights. It provides good complexity and has lots of options and will also force you to learn how to strategise. Of course all settlers games are dependent on luck (of the dice). After countless hours of gaming fun, I wish to play more.

Haven't played this for a while, mainly because I rarely have the 3-4 players to make it worthwhile. A great game, and my intro into designer games.
Edit June 2013: Played a couple of games today with friends who had never played before. Great fun, but with my slightly more mature gaming palate it's obvious that a) you can lose before the game starts, depending upon placement of your initial settlements, and b) there is a significant random componant than can be frustrating. Enjoyable regardless.

The turn mechanics can be a bit slow especially at the beginning when select numbers don't turn up often. Also, even with probability, thr dice can sometimes roll not the way everyone wants them to. Ive heard of people replacing the dice with a "deck" which authentically distributes the probabilities of what the dice rolls "should" be. Towards the end there is more action. Ive also played the family edition. PM me if you're interested in the subtle differences.

Love the variable board you can create with the hexes.... but overall I've found the game a little dry. We've only played two-player (both by playing two colors each and using Theuber's two-player variant.) Our enthusiasm started failing after a game where we managed to roll a seven on practically every turn (two rolls each using Theuber's variant...) it was very long and very brutal.

I imagine this is a better game for four.

卡坦島是三大桌遊之一，更有其歷史地位，現在的桌遊工業可以說靠著它才慢慢茁壯!它讓桌遊擺脫以往地產大亨給人的刻板印象，讓大家知道原來桌上遊戲的機制也是很有變化的!
玩家各自戰領不同的地形，蓋蓋城鎮或城堡，每個地形會產特定資源，並且用某個骰子點數來表示，每回合擲骰來獲取資源，資源可以任意打嘴砲交易，再用資源升級建築物，另外有一些特殊加分的額外獎勵，最後比分數，簡單介紹就是這樣子。

What can you say about Catan? It's the ultimate gateway game for modern board gaming for those who's experience with board gaming ended with Monopoly. Remarkably easy to teach and grasp, but rife with enough nuance to stay interesting after countless plays. The only reason I rate it as low as I have is simply due to the sheer number of times I've played it or introduced it has me rather burnt out on the game. Still, I'd rather play it than nothing at all, though given an amicable group I'd almost always play something else, simply because I've played it too much, though that's a compliment in and of itself!

This game has a little bit of everything.  A little luck, a little strategy, a little co-operation, a little "screw your opponent" with the thief.  The thief's presence blocking a good resource tile has turned out to be the far greater threat than the card he steals.  The only trouble is that it's a bit finicky with 2 players, so we don't get to play it that often.  And there are so many exciting games to play when we have enough people, this one doesn't get the attention it deserves.

I played a number of games (including Dune) in high school.  I played this for the first time in college (2001) and didn't care for it or the people I played it with (their other big game was MtG, which I also disliked)- and I started to get away from gaming.  I've gotten back into gaming in the last few years, so I thought I would give it another go with new, friendlier people.  I still don't care for it. There is a ton of luck and the major luck mitigating mechanism is negotiation (one of my least favorite mechanisms in games).  It might be ok for me if it was much shorter.  I'd rather use Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride as a gateway game.

We have the Dutch version, "The Kolonisten van Catan" from 999 games.  This is a much played game with us and friends.  Usually, we like to play it with the seafarer expansion set the most.

The first few times that I played this, I found it really boring!!!  After playing it with other beginners, I began to "get it" more and really started to enjoy it.  Now, I love it.

Since we originally purchased it, we have bought just about every expansion set out there... official and unofficial.  It is such an addictive, fun game.

One thing that we changed though, was we bought 12 sided dice, which evens out the chances of numbers being played.

I enjoy playing this game much more with expansions than the stand alone game.

RATING: 7
This was the game that ripped me from the tendrils of Risk and Monopoly and into the world of BoardGameGeek. It gets bonus points for that. Mayfair Games has released expansion after expansion - in my mind, each one making it just a tiny bit worse than the original. I honestly don't think, in retrospect, this is a good 'gateway game'. Necessary kingmaker effect (how does a new player accurately determine who's in the lead?). It leads to a lot of player manipulation that shouldn't exist for players new to gaming. It has serious runaway leader problems if there isn't a concerted team effort to lock that player down AND a series of fortunate rolls. That being said, it's a lovely game, and there's a lot of subtlety to what is technically an incredibly simple game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Sigh.  The eternally over-rated Settlers.  Why some laud this game, which is just as random and just as prone to hosing some players out of the competition early on, as a premiere example of the German style, is beyond me.  Don't get me wrong -- it's great fun -- but it's about as luck filled as Monopoly.

I played a lot of Catan in my 3.5 years of college. I mean a lot. I was pretty hooked on this game from the moment I played it. Now, it is just ok for me, but will still play it as a social activity when asked. A wonderful gateway game that emphasizes trading and probability. Go for wheat.

A different, simple but elegant game idea. Higly recommended! My critics is that I find the game end abrupt. It is not clear to everyone when the game i about to end.

Must admit I was a little underwhelmed when I finally played this.  I got the feeling I got with many Euros (and much greater ones).  Figure the odds, get the road, etc.  An exercise in probability-figuring, with randomness that borders on the unwelcome.

I do like this game.  Game I used to start a monthly game night with some friends at work.  They all loved. Good gaming and social interaction.  Complaint is the color of the pieces.  I repainted mine. Favorite is "Guts" Catan with three players.  Fast and furious.

I hate this game, so why do I own it?

I hate the randomness of the dice. I hate the way "trading" exists, yet with decent players, will rarely happen favorably. I hate the way people coin this the "gateway game".

To be fair, Cities and Knights makes this game much more palatable, but I'd still rather play Kingsburg.

RATING: 6.5
Gateway game for me just like most people.  It isn't a bad game.  I actually like playing it online more than in person for some reason.   I think it might be with not having to deal with setup and online the pace is much faster.   If the pace is kept up, it helps with the fact that you don't really have that many choices that you can make each turn.  The game doesn't play you but you definitely are not overwhelmed with possibilities, which is probably why it is a gateway game. 

I have played the shit out of it online so my enthusiasm for it is probably a little muted. I know I have more plays of it than any other game.  It isn't a bad game by any stretch.  There are just other games that have similar mechanisms and are better.  I would give the game a solid 7.  There is nothing wrong with the game, I have kind of just played it out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I love the game because its simple to teach and isn't too long.  Resource management can get to be a bit of a pain, but since its based in cards, I don't mind it so much.

Very fun game at first. Well thought out game system of resources, trade and building. Part of the fun is also what turned me away after 50 games: there is a lot of luck involved at the end game phase and can make the last player beat those that were on the verge of winning for the past 15 minutes. Nice accessible game for all, but hardly what hardcore strategists are looking for. A game you eventually grow out of.

Turns out I'm not a big fan of the 'victory points' accounting system.  I understand spreadsheeting makes it easy to balance any mechanism, but I'd rather have balance emerge organically from the underlying mechanics.

I HATE Settlers.  Is it a bad game?  No, anything but.  Why then?  Becuase we played nothing else for *months* when our group first moved from MtG to board games.  Once every 6 months is fine for me.

So why do I dislike it so much?  In an ideal game everyone would have equal luck with the resources at an equal time during the game.  However, the game can be skewed so badly by one player getting their share of the luck early on in the game. Once that player or even those players are ahead it is very difficult to rein them in simply because if they have not been stupid with their expansion plans they will be getting resources more often than everyone else. 
A good starting position while essential to win, in no way guarantees it.  How many 5 'n' 9's games have you had when you have been able to get a 6 and 8 for your starting villages.  Some randomness in games is a good thing, perfect information and grand strategy has it's place but for me the spice and seasoning is the little random events that make you re-think, re-evaluate and plan on the fly.  Settlers has far too much of that good thing. 
It is a frustrating game for that reason with a lack of control to go with it.  Sure over time the skillful player will win more games in the same way that an expert backgammon player will beat the novice every time over a set of games. 
Oh and heaven forbid that you as the unlucky one be adjacent to the "leader" in which case the robbers directed at them will happily sit on your resources as well.  
Yes it is a great game that can simply bring new and innovative mechanics to an audience raised on the gaming hind teat that is monopoly and Clue(do).  Yes it has been hugely influential in the expansion of this hobby and yes I hve probably played this more than any other game that I own.  
But there are better games.  Better games for gamers with more control ahd deeper thought; better gateway games for non-gamers with simpler rules and a more forgiving start. 

Settlers will always have a place in my collection the trouble is twce a year is more than enough for it to hit the table.

My rating perhaps is particularly biased.  And, to be sure, this game gets its share of derision here at BGG.  Maybe some of it is just; after all, there is a significant luck factor.  But I am among the legions of gamers for whom the genesis of eurogames began with Settlers.  And after ten years, I'm still happy to play it.  I love the interaction, the planning, the scheming.  So yes, Settlers deserves its pedistal in my household.

This where it all restarted for me in boardgaming terms. Each game you randomly form the island of Catan by linking hexagons. Each land hexagon (barring one, the desert) can produce one of five type of resources (wool, clay, ore, wood or grain) and is given a number from 2 to 12. At the beggining of each players turn two dice and each player that has a village or a city in one of the hexagon(s) with that number get that resource. Other ways to get resources inclue trading with your opponents and, of course, robbing them. With the resources you build more roads, villages and cities, as well as buying "development cards" that allow special actions or offer VP. First player to get 10 VP, wins.

12 years now since discovering Settlers and I still haven't got tired from it.

If the first thing that comes to your mind when someone says 'Board Game' is Monopoly, it's time you played this.  This game will give you a new appreciation for board gaming, and will breathe new life into the ways you can have fun with your friends.  My rating is lower because I've played it to death, but without a doubt, you must play this game if you are a board game noob.

Like so many other people here, Settlers of Catan was my "gateway game" to "modern" boardgaming. Still trying to find a game to match Settlers's elegance, interactivity, and replayability :-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a game that strikes a nice balance of strategy and luck, and its pleasures and nuances become greater with every play. The luck factor needs to be absorbed since a long run of bad rolls can beat you down and create some very cranky players, but most bad luck balances out over several plays. I think this game deserves every accolade it has received and even writing about it now makes me want to play. This is a great game.

Update: After a couple of years of playing this seminal game, I stand by my original assessment. There are other games that have come after which I would often prefer to play now, but the fact is it remains the most requested and often-played game in my family. It also remains the most contentious, as the luck factor seems to make everyone rather edgy at least once during any given game. Still, it is often the go-to game on a night when everyone just wants to sit down and play something quickly.

I was several years into the hobby before I got around to playing this.   So by that point it wasn't a gateway game for me.

Truly a masterpiece game.

Enjoyment from this game is highly dependent on the skills of the other people playing the game. If you understand the value of things better than others, you will crush them.

It's not that I'm just being a game snob. This was my first game and I loved it. It still has an important place in the hobby - it's just not for me anymore. It's just too long. There's not really enough interesting choices. The robber has gone from being fun to being mean. 

If I do play I like 5 players. More room to move and trading with everyone all the time.

Too much luck and the game can get bogged down with the random setup. Also, once a player is behind and choked off by roads it’s quite a boring trip to the endgame. That said, the negotiation aspect of this game is amazing and what draws me back. Every seasoned gamer should own a copy of Settlers for the sole purpose of introducing friends to real board games.

RATING: 9
*Generally in most game designs players will know well before their last turn where they stand (unless vps are kept secret such as in E & T) so robs most of the players of the excitement.I think one main reason why Settlers does it for me is that there are a few elements which makes the game less likely to be anti-climatic than any game design I have played before or since. 

Resource holdings are secret, so there is tense uncertainty (unless you have memorised the transactions) whether other players will overtake you in the vp race, which incidently is kept at a simple and visual level.

But the clincher is the dice which in their nature provides hopeful swings in fortune or devasting schaudenfreude. The use of the commonly rolled "7" has been used to great effect to put risk filled fear in the leader from hoarding and also the robber as another mechanic to try and level the playing field, in a thematic way. 

So the tension of declaring the 10th vp is often in doubt until the right resource is secured in a trade, the vp development card is drawn or worse you have accummalated more than 7 resources and fingers crossed no-one even yourself that a 7 is rolled. The development costs menu means that an internalised narrative of needs is established cranking up the climax.

This is a game that will still be played 100 years from now. A ground breaking game with all the attributes for becoming a classic.
A great game for the whole family. Unfortunately, luck plays a huge role and the initial placement of the settlements can often unfairly help or severely hinder a player.  The 5-6 player game is even worse in this respect. Furthermore, the game is susceptible to decisions based on meta gaming. For these reasons it has lost its initial appeal and I play it only occasionally now. Nevertheless, its mass appeal and staying power are  unmistakable.

Useful gateway game as the high luck element allows new players to win a decent percentage of the time, and it is easy to teach and learn. Trading provides interaction between players and makes it a social experience (without which it would be a very dull game). Unfortunately it is too easy to fall behind early and have no chance of catching up, through no fault of your own. Edit: Using the event deck instead of dice goes a long way toward mitigating luck. Still, two players had bad starts positionally on the board and were behind the whole game. If you place first and get surrounded you can be at a huge disadvantage. Still lukewarm on the game.

I've been playing Catan before I actually got into hobby gaming. I had an app for it on my XB360 and quite enjoyed it. Once I did get into modern board gaming, it made sense to pick up a physical copy, and I enjoyed playing it. That interest waned however, as there were other games that I would rather play. Catan simply became too luck based and long for us. We did enjoy the various mini-expansions from Traders and Barbarians, specifically the fish and harbormaster, event deck and two player rules. Sadly, they weren't enough to mitigate our growing issues with the game. It still holds a special place in my heart though, and would play it once in a blue moon (maybe).

As with original Risk...it is time for Settlers to retire.

Classic and influential although flawed. Many people's first Euro; fairly lightweight gateway,

-Dice results can be frustrating (too much randomness); sometimes you have very little to do on your turn. Players can be blocked early and more motivation to just play Kingmaker. Open trading between players can be exploited by more experienced players. 2 player variants exist, but don't play well.

The classic trading and resource management game. The initial settlement placement determines your entire game success. Unfortunately since resources are produced based on die rolls, even the best plans can result in utter failure. This game is best played with the Fisherman of catan mini expansion to even the resource collection spots out a little more, and no other expansions. The more expansions this gets, the more unwieldy it gets. This includes the 5-6 player expansion that removes the whole tension of rolling 7s by allowing players to buy between turns.

It's common for gamers to sour on Settlers but its ability to get new people into the hobby can't be underrated. I think the reason it's proven so enduringly popular is its familiarity to non-gamers. Like Monopoly, you roll two dice at the start of your turn and do what they say. Like Monopoly you try to build houses to enable you to gather more resources. Like Monopoly you haggle and trade with other players to try and make up sets. And compared to Monopoly, the commonly-made gamer complaint that you can be hosed by unlucky placement and dice rolls pales into insigificance - at least you can't be eliminated! 

When I first played Settlers, I was blown away by how many clever things it does compared to the 'classic' games I knew: properly makes use of probability; continuously moves towards a conclusion; keeps everyone involved when it's not their turn. Sure I can see some of its weaknesses now, and it's a game that I don't really play with gamers. But I'll happily pull it out any time with my family - my non-gamer sister and her husband adore it.

There isn't anything to be said that hasn't been said already.  As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best games if you've got about an hour to kill.  The biggest weakness is that it only plays 3 or 4, but that can be remedied by buying the 5-6 player expansion.

This game usually goes over well with new gamers.  I love the interaction and table talk.  It can be boring if your numbers never come up on the dice, or an opponent blocks you.  There can also be run away leaders.  Even with those issues, the game is fun.  I love the concept of having a wide open board to execute your strategies upon.  One of the few games where I sleeved the cards because it is played that often.

Unfotunately, though this game is really fun to play, my burnout level has been reached and I am not sure that I want to play this one in the near future.

Update: Leaving the rating where it is.  But it does need to be said: I think this game gives you the illusion that you are making decisions rather than actually giving you decisions. A lot of your decisions are decided by what the game is rolling for you. Still lots of fun with new people though.

I'm not as keen to play this as I used to be.  I would like to try it again with some variants/house rules to speed up play--e.g. the harbor master, tournament rules (second placement is a city rather than a settlement) and the welfare variant (if a player does not earn a resource from the die roll, they receive a coin; players can then redeem the number of coins equal to their victory points currently on the board for a resource of their choice).

Depending on how much they shorten the game time, these variants might even make the 5-6 player extension bearable.

This is the ONLY game my wife actually asks to play. I think the key to this games broad and sustainable success is: 
1. Non-violent
2. Fairly simple rules
3. A pinch of luck (that impacts all players uniformly)
4. Interaction through trading (but not unlimited interaction)
5. Random map combined with dynamic starting positions.

We much prefer playing with the Seafarers expansion and the use of unknown tiles that are discovered during play.

This is a classic game, but one that holds up very well to repeated playing, at least for me.  There's so much to love about the simplicity of this game.  Its so easy to teach, so easy to play, and yet it holds my interest.

That being said, I immediately bought the Seafarers expansion and can't imagine playing without it.  I feel like the game might eventually go stale on its own.  However, with the endless scenarios that Seafarers (and now Das Buch) provides, I don't think I'll ever turn down a game of this.

Wonderful game with several possible strategies that plays differently every time. Always ends a little too soon. A good game for the introduction of 'full scale' Euros to new players. New players would enjoy the room of the 3-player game whereas gamers need the full 4. Better balanced than the card game due ganging up to 'get the leader'. Probably should be a 7 with repeated play. Actually prefer the older edition components to the 3D version.

Unless players are of equal experience, the newer player will likely not know who is in the lead when making trades and placing the robber.

Probably the most well-known designer board game. I didn't get to play it until fairly recently. At first, I thought it was too luck-based based on the dice rolls, so I hated it. Later on, I discovered all of the different possible strategies (ore/wheat + dev cards + army, road building + longest road, producing all, sheep monopoly), which made it interesting again.

Definitely an interaction-driven game.  Low-medium learning curve.  With many of people I've played with though, turn length becomes an issue, and this is a function of both group and game I think.  Ten minute intervals before a player gets to do something makes for a more disjointed experience.

Reglas sencillas, posibilidad de meter mucho azar para que los comienzos no sean siempre iguales...

Quizás el punto débil sea el azar que hay durante la partida, las tiradas de dados y las cartas "sorpresa" pero con todo resulta muy entretenido, además el azar en cierto modo es "controlable", cada jugador puede plantear su estragtegia para que le sea a priori más favorable.

A great game. Simple to play, has a good balance of luck verses strategy. I Like how you are encouraged to trade to get ahead. The hand size limits imposed by the robber keeps you from hoarding.
It is easy to fall behind the development curve, but you can restrain a runaway leader by not trading. Anyway if some of the charity variants can level out the bad die rolls.
A good family game.

On of the best games I played was a 4 player settlers - on player announced that he was building a settlement for the win only to find out he didn't have one more. The look on his face was priceless

RATING: 7
A true classic family game. The new edition with the nice design and figures are wonderful and has a different atmosphere than the old edition from the 1990's. Despite it is an old Spiel das Jahres game, it is still a good game but should be played only with the extensions as the base game is flat and has a big luck factor due to the dice rolls. The Event cards which replaces the dice is definitely a must for every Catan game as it makes a better planned game (not sure why it is still not shipped with the new base game). The Traders and Barbarians or the Cities & Knights extensions give more complexity and better game experience why it still remains a family game.

RATING: 9
One of the best luck based strategy games I've ever played.  It's actually quite easy to learn, as my players can atest to.  The player expansions, as well as seafarers and knights, is a must have to expand the game and bring it to that extra step of strategy that's needed.

While it's potentially easy to mitigate the luck aspect of this game, it can be too streaky with the dice to be fun, especially with 5 players.  Because of the luck factor, the presence of the "jerk" moves - blocking routes, refusing to trade, monopolies - can turn the game sour, real fast.

You really can't go wrong with this game.  I love the trading aspect with players (and how no one will trade with you near the end of the game if you are leading!).  I love how no two games are alike based on the random board setup.  I love how you can teach it to a new player and they can play mostly appropriately during their first time.  I would play this every day!

The agreed definition of a eurogame.
The gamers game closest to being mainstream (over 28k owners just here in BGG).
With a lot of reasons: it has a fantastic theme, nice bits, great mechanics, and offers fun, tension, interactiion, and a wide range of different options.
It has everything, a lot of strategy but also some randomness and even big screwage possibilities (here comes the robber...)
The negotiation is what makes this game so exiting.
We all enjoy it in our family and play iy pretty often.
But IMHO it is just a little heavy to be the ideal gateway game (maybe it could be the ideal step two game)

I really liked it. But could never understand why my wife disliked it, until she pointed out that I had introduced Agricola and Dominion to her first.

I understand the significance this has had for our hobby, but for me, the runaway leader problem kills this one. Someone can get boxed in with no decent expansion possibilities and have no hope of winning literally over an hour before the game ends. I understand this only happens when someone makes mistakes during the early turns, but if we're using this as an introductory game, it is very possible that someone's first experience with European-style board gaming involves putting down some starting settlements and then getting surrounded and feeling powerless for the rest of the game. That is board gaming at its worst; is that really what we want our first impression to be?

Historical rating: 10

EDIT: After reading several interviews with designer Klaus Teuber, I can say that his presence in the games industry is an absolutely wonderful thing, and I admire his attitude and actions. I wish I liked his game more, but I have no trouble liking the man himself.

I am lowering my rating on Settlers to a more appropriate level, considering my current gaming tastes. While I admire what the series has done for the hobby, I no longer consider it the classic I once did.

Once upon a time, I liked this game, but once upon a time I liked Monopoly.  This game is far too long and far too random.  Initial placement decides the game nearly every time depending on whether more sixes or more eights are rolled.  Players with good rolls don't need to trade at all!  Would work better if each player was allowed to draw a card of their choice at the end of every turn - and it would speed things up.  Again, game is too long!

This game single-handedly changed my out-look on board games. A year ago I thought German games looked silly with their wooden pieces and abstract play mechanics. Now I know that they are very fun to play.

I was introduced to this game by a friend and I loved it right from the start. Its easy to learn, quick to play (2 hours or less) and there is lots of interaction with other players. I have since purchased the game and shared it with many other friends who also loved it (and bought it). This game spreads like a virus.

11/08/2007: I constantly felt that luck was quite a huge factor in this game. I won my first round because my opponents kept rolling 5s which granted me double doses of wheat and iron ore due to my cities being located at those hexes!

An entry-level game for anyone who wants to start their board game adventure. Well produced and nice graphics but the mechanics are inherently based on luck with dice or luck with trading. If noone agrees to trade, the game can stall horribly, and if you trade too freely, your opponents will simply build things ahead of you. It really needs some variant that will force players into more interaction (i.e. resources aging and vanishing eventually, so it makes sense to trade, etc. etc).

The only reason I hate Catan is because I know there are better things out there. That doesn't mean the game itself is terrible. I just feel like there's a disappointed parent hovering over my shoulder whenever I play, sadly whispering "I know you can do so much better, if only you tried."

There is a lot going for Catan, though, as an introductory game for non-gamers to the Wonderful World of the Euro. Unfortunately, the game feels like it's actually about 10 minutes long (initial placement + the first few rolls), since most of the game is decided then.

It also incorporates freeform trading, which I strongly dislike due to the fact that it creates a ton of kingmaking or blacklisting ("I don't like you, so I won't trade with you even though you're behind and it's beneficial to me to do so") opportunities.

I have a standing rule for myself that I limit playing games of Catan to about once every 2 months. Any more than that and I'd probably rather just do something else instead.

RATING: 7
Interesting game which I played for the first time recently as many non-casual gamers fear it like the vampire fears the cross, I am not sure why. The game and the fun you have while playing it depends on who you are playing it with, some people enjoy the fierce competition and trying to blockade each other, refuse trading etc., others may find it too vicious. The random element is a nice idea, also experienced players have a big advantage. Another flaw in my opinion is the accumulative nature of successes, the more resources you have, the more you can build and the more you build the more resources you have, which can be a pain in the ass should the starting conditions be unbalanced because that will be hard to flatten out later in the game. Still, a neat little game which could have done with some better artwork and theme instead of the plaster-on. I reckon that the expansions add a lot to it but I am not sure whether Ill ever be able to give those a go, considering the general reluctance of geeks to play it.

I give it recognition for getting a ton of people in board gaming, but it's not a game I would seek out to play. I might be convinced to play a game if I was stuck in a cabin in the mountains with a group of people, miles from civilization and it was the only game available.

We've added both Seafarers and the Traders and Barbarians expansions, and we rarely play without some kind of enhancement to the main game now.

Traders and Barbarians has the more interesting bits. We like everything except the River wealthiest/poorest settler cards. Caravan has only been played once; it was ok but no one really loved it. Like this river better than the Great River I own: http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/66303/my-minor-expansions

Both Barbarian Attack and the Traders and Barbarians scenarios are nice. We like to combine them into a mega scenario. See my variant article: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/4667918

Settlers, Settlers, where to start.

In the late 90's I was looking for a board game that was better than, or at least equal to but different from, Talisman.  People kept telling about Settlers of Catan and I eventually found a copy at a local game store.  After playing it turned out to be a big dud.  I eventually got a copy of Robo Rally and that turned out to be the next best thing to Talisman at the time.

Back to Settlers, I had a copy of the game, didn't like it much, bought all the expansions (the local game store only had Warhammer, CCGs and Settlers so what else was there to buy?) to see if they would add that little spark to the game.  I became somewhat fond of the six player all expansions way of playing.  All my friends liked it so I ended up playing it quite a bit (my copy of the game is quite beat up).

Why didn't it work for me?  Because Catan is a negotiation game.  And when you play with people (myself included) that love to argue about the minutest detail even vanilla Catan can become a two hour slog.

The game is just not designed for the purpose of fierce competition.  It's a family game where people get to build cool houses and cities.  These things increase a player's ability to produce.  So you feel like you are doing something as the game progresses even if you lose...except for when you get a sequence of bad die rolls that allow your opponents to cut you off at the beginning of the game.

The game is quite simple: roll dice, produce goods, trade with your opponents, build.  It's thrilling as any dice game is.  Everyone is invested in every die roll so the game can provide a fun party-like atmosphere.  It's not the greatest game, nor is it particularly revolutionary, but it is fun, interactive, popular and allows players to build cool things.

I don't really like this game but I will give it respect and give it a 4. That being said this is where it ends. I don't understand why this is still highly touted because I'd rather play every game I have in my collection over this one. It's heyday was in 1995 people. It's 2016! This game is for beginners, yet so many people play this game and only know this game! You need to get out more. What's the appeal? There are so many better intro level games out there that fit the euro game style.. here are several for you to look into -- Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, Alhambra, or even Forbidden Island. Don't see why this is at all used as a gateway gamer except getting peer pressured into play this game by gamers who call themselves gamers just becuase they know Catan.

RATING: N/A
One of my "gateway" games. When I first played, I was sucked into an experience that I had never seen in board games before. First game I was confused, next 5-6 games I was amazed. After that I realized that the luck factor and the low amount of depth really wasn't what I was looking for, and looked to branch out. However, I am unsure on this being the "go-to" gateway game as players are often at a huge disadvantage the first time playing, its difficulty to teach compared to other gateways, and its relatively long play time (which feels longer when you're losing! haha.) 

Anyways, lots of props to this game for sucking me in and others into the hobby. Still using it today to help people get into boardgaming. It's pretty darn player independent, and has relatively wide appeal. However, I find it annoying when people ask to play it AGAIN and AGAIN, when there's other games that these people are capable of and enjoy as well.

I feel like this game has really low strategy, and is often determined on who rolls the best. This can be solved with a deck mechanic that I have yet to try, but I would just save my time for other games. Components are nice, theme is good, and execution for what it is is spot on. 

The interaction with 5-6 players is a lot more enjoyable though, and I would be willing to play Catan with friends if its with that expansion (comments on that should be somewhere around here). It bugs me when people pride themselves in winning Catan though, as I feel like it is very luck-based. Just my 0.02 ;)

Revised down to 5.

I played a tournament of Settlers of Catan.  This game is NOT a good tournament.  WAY TOO RANDOM!  The judges even said so much.  It is a fun family game.  For me it is on its way to being a better version of Monopoly.

Played two games in June '06.  The endgame seems laborious.  Or there inevitably becomes a king maker.  However the game is very good.

The game that started it all. Some friends introduced us to this game in January of 2012 and now I have a BGG account, two shelves of board games and a wishlist that grows by three for every one I remove.

I won't say we've "moved on" from this game, but it hasn't had much play since being used as a gateway game. I blame this on us mostly wanting to play two player games and there are just so many better two player games out there than any two player variant of Catan.

= 2014-02-14 - R:6.99

Happy Valentine's Day. In sticking with the theme for the day, I'd like to share some love for this game. I gave it a 6 because, on the official BGG scale, it's a game I admire but would only play when in a certain mood. That mood is more situational than anything. There are many times when my wife and I want to play a game together and we'd like that game to have the feel of Catan, but so far we haven't been able to capture that feel in a two player game. When we do have enough people over to be able to play a four player game, I rarely want to play board games. So poor Catan never makes it to our table even though I think I want to play it. In honor of how much Catan influences our search for other games, I'm bumping the rating from 6 to 6.99.

Irony. 
Disappointing at first but not because of the game.

I was told that it's too complicated for me and the second time I tried, I was never taught properly and so it made me feel discouraged. Frustrated, I bought the game and taught myself how to play. Then, I found a new set of friends to play with me. lol. 

It's a classic and like all classics, it can be over played. Rotate the games like food and it won't be hated. The game's enjoyment really depends on group dynamics because of trading to mitigate the dice rolls. There's a "gang up on that person" element and for that reason, I switched to Explorers & Pirates.

.:Best 4:.

--
Expansions
// The Fishermen- Use this all the time with the Catan's base game.
// Explorers & Pirates- The expansion that takes the best from Seafarers and Cities & Knights.

The Settlers of Catan is a marvelous 'gateway' game for those who have only played Monopoly or Clue.  It is incredibly simple to learn, yet strategic enough to allow for some deep gameplay decisions.  It very much serves as a bridge between a game like Monopoly and a game like Puerto Rico.  If you're trying to get some of your friends to dip their toe in deeper games such as the ones lauded on this website, this is definitely the game to start with.

(Initial comments: ) I don't get all the love for this game. It's too dependant on rolls. If you don't get good rolls to acquire resources, you can't do much as a player. The 7-high card limitation leads to some players getting screwed repeatedly.

(Multiple replays through the years have upped the score from a 5 to a 7.5 I still think it's over-liked, but as a historical game that can bring in non-gamers to a wider world of gaming, it could even warrant another .5 point)

~~~~~~~~~~

Played with 6 and the event cards, and a variant where anyone could build at the end of everyones turn. It took a bit longer than I would have liked. I liked the event cards as they added some variety, but at the same time felt that they could seem lopsided at times.

I like the element of chance and the great player interaction, combined with the considerable strategic and tactical choices to make.  Plays fast, no player elimination and no 'analysis' problems.  Overall, a great game that's usually a lot of fun. Not rated as highly as I used to rate it, because I see now it suffers from chance having far too much effect in the first few turns: if you don't get resources early while your opponents do, you're hosed for the rest of the game, and it's not much fun. I've dropped my rating of this game once again, after another un-fun game. I don't need to WIN to have fun, but when I've managed to build only one section of road while other players have built their third settlement and two cities, it's something wrong with the game. But don't forget, I said "It's usually a lot of fun" and I mean it.

How can you go wrong? It is THE resource management/worker placement game that is both gateway and staple of most boardgamer's experiences. Sure, there may be games that do things better and plays more smoothly, but they will never have what this game gives - fulfillment of nostalgia.

so I finally played the granddaddy of them all, and all I can say is: the jury is still out for me on this game. The random set up and production rolls can lock a player out from contention early on. i don't like having to play a game for 30 more minutes with no chance of winning. Some resources seem more useful than others--why would anybody trade brick with you? seems to suffer from a rich get richer problem. those who can build roads can build settlements, can gain more resources, etc. maybe some of the problems were due to a very weird random board set up--like resources were all lumped together and a we had a full compliment of 6 players, which seemed to add to the length and randomness. I would like to play this again with just four.  

o.k. i've played this again this time with 3 players and i enjoyed it a little more. i can see where the appeal of this game with people who aren't game enthusiasts lies. very easy rules to teach and learn. the modular board is attractive and so different from what most people who don't play games as a hobby are used to seeing in a game, that the game can draw in uninitiated players  right in. 

i like how the trading stimulates player interaction, which is an element of the game that is much different for people only familiar with mass market US games. though, in my opinion,  the trading mechanism doesn't quite work 100% well, or is mostly uninteresting. 

there are some commodities in some games that will be more valuable than others because of the random production roles. players in the lead will at some point in the mid to late game find themselves never lacking. when they do need a trade, however, its in order to put them close to the win or to just win outright. this puts players who are behind, in a kingmaker position. sometimes to be able to do anything useful you will be forced to trade somebody something that's infinitely more useful to them because of their position in the game. your only other choice is to not make trades to these players and languish, or put another player in a position to win. if you don't trade, it becomes a matter of sitting there and waiting for the players in the lead to get lucky and have their production numbers come up, so that one of them can build whatever it is they need to win. how fun.

i enjoy the game up into the mid to late game where it gets boring, and it's obvious who is going to win, but the game nevertheless continues. 

i just don't really feel that a player's decisions amount to much in this game. production roles: luck. stealing resources with the robber: luck. drawing cards from the development deck: luck. 

still i'm happy to have this game on hand, despite my negative comments, because it something to play with people who aren't big on games due to the reasons i listed above.

So what if you luck out with bad dice rolls? If you settled a village next to wheat and then became a victim of drought would you complain about the lack of “luck”? No other German game has such a strong theme. Gosh, it’s almost a simulation. If you don’t like the dice factor there’s about 1000 or more diceless German games to choose from.

Dos primeiros jogos modernos que joguei. Tenho uma relação afetiva com ele.

Acho ele um jogo ótimo, adoro a negociação, a produção e a sorte no dados. E vejo que a galera hoje mais experiente nos boards meio que odeia o jogo, o que eu acho uma bobagem.

Sempre uma experiencia divertida, ficar lutando por mais rotas, ou ficar em segredo com cartas bacana e vencer o jogo sem ninguém suspeitar.

Would give this a 1 or 0, but I have to recognize the mechanics are very well designed (even for a euro game).  It just seems that every time I play with people who know each other and some of those people don't have a drive 'to be good' at the game always end up helping their friends (and usually don't consciously realize it).  The game has no inherent ability to stop this behavior.  Therefore, unless I'm playing with really competitive players or people who don't know each other, the game is almost always ruined because some player is getting pumped by their 'helper'.

I didn't think this game lived up to its hype but it is very fun.  My wife didn't want to play it and wouldn't listen to the rules.  After playing it, she now loves it.  I don't like it as well as some of my deeper board games like El Grande or Tigris.  I also don't like the long setup times and the ridiculous price of the expansions.

What is there to say about Catan? Well, a lot actually. Of course, there is it's prestigious (and hardly arguable in my opinion) claim to bringing "German-style" board gaming to the world. For most of us, Catan was probably the first non-American classic you played, or at least heard of. 

My group and me mispronounce the name, at first ignorantly, and now out of habit as "Kay-ten", of course the correct pronunciation is "Cuh-tahn" but we've grown so used to it, that the simple misnomer "Kay-ten", or occasionally, "Settlers", is almost always how we refer to it.

There is a lot of luck here, resource generation is dice based but player investment is constant because resources can flow into your [-]sweaty hands[/-] warehouses even when it isn't your turn, and trades are flying this way and that on a regular basis. It can drag, if luck isn't on your side or you placed your settlements poorly, but overall it is leagues beyond your normal Monopoly, Risk, or Life game in terms of interaction, interest, and ability to influence the outcome through clever play. It is always fun, even if it occasionally overstays it's welcome. Many "better" games have come along, but there is something about the nostalgia and brilliant design that will keep most coming back.

I must say:  I don't get it.  I found it mildly entertaining, and accessible to the non-gamers in my family, but also a little boring.  Fall behind early, and you're cooked, waiting, monopoly-like, for the inevitable.  Start well, and establish a good position in the first few rounds, and you can usually count on the dice to take you home.  What's all the fuss about?

Played many times, mostly with Cities and Knights. This is in large part just a roll and go (Row and go for you Obama supporters) The thing that makes this game so good is everyone is involved, or can be involved in every player turn. In other words, very little down time. It does have some luck involved with the dice rowing...er...rolling but you have so much fun it does not matter.

Best game ever. They created an environment that easily lends itself to variations. After we played out all 3 games as is, we tried many variations found online (including 2 that i bought on Ebay) &amp; ideas that we came up with ourselves. Practically each game is a brand new game. Any one version might not stand up on it&#039;s own to Puerto Rico (getting it this week), but the possibilities kept us busy for a year once a week. Also, my 8 year old son understands this game (not enough to win though).

RATING: 8
This was the first considerable board game I had played since I was a child playing Monopoly.

And I must say, I love it.  The game seems simple on the surface, and is relatively easy to pick up, but strategy permeates the entire game.  From placement, to building strategies, and trading for resources, every action has consequences and there are always multiple options to choose from.  Often, a single card can change your entire strategy; I often see players about to build a development card, make a good trade, and shift gears into building a city or a settlement.  With so many ways to gain points, and so many ways to build up, there are always different strategies to try.  Combined with the interaction between players and the random board designs, there is no perfect strategy, requiring players to constantly be aware and plan their next moves accordingly.

My only complaint is the fact that dice rolls determine what resources you get.  While a little randomness keeps things changing and unpredictable, resources are so important that an unlucky streak can break even the best strategy.  Combined with the exponential productivity growth, a slow start due to unlucky rolls can quickly separate the winners from the losers.  This sometimes results in people giving up mid-game, complaining that they've already lost and making unreasonable trades to break everybody else's strategy.  There's a lack of sportsmanship apparent here, but the fact that players can get into an unstoppable losing or winning position can make the rest of the game less fun.

Still, this is an excellent game that I have played dozens of times over the last couple of years and I still enjoy playing to this day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I always find this game exciting.  Catan, more than almost any other game I play, makes me feel like I'm building a little civilization. I feel such pride when I build a road, or when I put up a new settlement.  It's also quite exhilarating to roll the exact number needed to get the resource that you need just as it's devestating to roll a seven when you've got a hand full of cards.  With as many times as I've played this game (I got it before I started keep close numbers on my play stats), I still enjoy it a lot.

The only thing that I find frustrating is the dice rolling.  If Catan had no dice, and instead had some other way of allocating resources, it would possible be in my top ten.  Instead, it's a game that I play sometimes because it's a classic and because it's a game that I discovered fairly early on in my development from game enjoyer to game enthusiast.  

***Update***

I haven't played Catan in months because I'm just not that interested in it now that I've passed the gateway stage.  The dice just bother me so much that I never take it out and play it.  Rating lowered to a six.

This is one of the best games for both new and experienced gamers. There are enough expansions out there to keep anyone interested and scale up to 6 people easily. Makes a good evening meet up game too. Only complaint is that the cost of the whole set is a bit much, but there's always e-bay. I don't like the images on the new printings either, but that's just personal preference, and is probably somewhat biased by the fact that since I learned on the old set, the new one "just doesn't look right."

It's a good game to get people into the hobby of board games, but I'm just not into it anymore.  I really don't like the dice.  It can cause you to just roll dice in a circle for an hour waiting for a resource to hit, even when you're sitting on the "common" die rolls.

It's OK, but there's too much chance of a player being effectively locked out of any possible expansion location, and thus any meaningful engagement with the game.  I think "Helpers of Catan" is a wonderful little expansion that fixes a lot of the problems I have with the game, though.  I'd rate "Settlers" plus "Helpers" at a 7.5 or so.

It's odd that this is the de facto "gateway" game, because the aggressive and sometimes very slow trading phase is sure to put a lot of people off.  Settlers also suffers with its catch-up options -- or lack thereof.  New players can run into trouble when they don't ensure a healthy flow of resources and are stuck watching more experienced players build around them.

This was my "gateway game" that introduced me to the broader aspects of boardgaming.  It doesn't get played much now that I have a 200+ collection, but I pulled it out recently and it still held.  I find the dice a bit frustrating, but not so much that I would use cards, because that aspect of it is part of the appeal to the game I think.  Having played this probably 50+ times, I do find myself always going for similar types of strategies, etc. but it's still a fun game.

I really like the totally open trading aspect of this game, which is something that other games still don's seem to replicate all that well.  Other games with trading tend to have restrictions on them, whereas in settlers you can trade things like port use, robber placement, intentions on where you are building, etc.  (I know these aren't all strictly following the rules, but we allow pretty much anything in trades in the games I play).

A classic no one interested in boardgames could possibly pass up, at least once. But when the initial wonder is past, the luck factor begins eating away your cheerfulness. In essence, Settlers is a clever game which may or may not leave you stranded (i.e., without a decent shot at winning) if the dice are against your production and others refuse to trade.

Catan is a beloved boardgame. I hate it. Catan is one of those games that is incredibly feast or famine. It is worst than MONOPOLY in that regard.

This game is important, but I find it absolutely dreadful.

There's a reason it's a classic!

Stale?...I think not!  However, I do agree that the opening set-up can be a little too powerful in some games.  But if you find yourself in a less than ideal game setup then it's time to go for the upset of the century.

Also, don't forget to trade.  This game is about trading.  If you refuse to trade because you don't want to help anyone then it's not really within the spirit of the game, IMO.  If you play that way, I could see why that game (and many games) would not be desirable for you.

The good part about Settlers is the excitement associated with each role of the dice....everyone is interested in the outcome.  Half will yell:  "yeah!!!"  and half will yell:  "Noooo!!!"     It's just fun.

In Settlers of Catan, players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine the current production on the island. Players collect raw materials to build up their civilizations to gain enough victory points to win the game.

Highly recommended to anyone who wants to see how short, deep, and fun a board game should be!

If you have this game you really need to break out of the box and design your own islands.  Geography can be such a great variable in this game, making it not only more challenging but more playable.  If you have trouble, ask me how.

The original gateway game. Always fun and close. Easy to learn. More than one way to win -- although everyone must build towns and cities with their resources, the winner usually separates themselves via longest road, largest army, or development cards.

ridiculous amount of negotiation & getting ganged-up on in late game

Bonus tip: trade all your resource X for opponent's resource Y, then play the Monopoly card on resource X (to regain all your X) to lose all your friends

Let's trade sheep for wood: my 3x sheep for your 1 wood. Oh but I'll play Monopoly on sheep later so you just gave me all your wood for nothing!

As with many people, this was my gateway to modern Euros. Having had far too many games where someone has won by rolls of "4" coming up almost every turn, I now prefer to play with a 'deck of dice' instead.

Actually, I may have to revisit my rating for this at some point, as I'm really struggling to think of when I would choose to play it; nostalgia, maybe?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A lot of classic mechanisms but very luck-heavy. 

Once someone edges ahead they will probably snowball and win by a lot.

A nice spatial feel, though, with good tension around whether it is worth building somewhere or whether you will get blocked. The 'robber' mechanism forces you to make those decisions or potentially be penalised.

I think this classic is still a very good gateway Euro game, especially for families. There is quite some interaction with trading (especially if played not uber-competitively) and at the end of the game, everybody has increased his settlements. So even if you are not the winner, you can look down at the board and feel good to have build something from the ressources you produced or traded. That is probably the major appeal of Catan, which is still working nowadays.

This game is very popular, but is not as good as have rating. Game has several problems: 
1. If your first move (placement initial vilage) is wrong game is lost for you. 
2. Be richer, be better. If you have advantage, your oponents has small chance to catch you.
3. Your moves are mostly automatic. No real choice. Often only wait for right dice. 

Majority games with rating 7.0 or more is better than this game. But this game is legend...

RATING: 8
Previously played Settlers online many years back a lot (a LOT!), and decided to buy a physical copy for my playing group which consists of my fiancée, my family and/or her family, and my friend (who is a semi-gamer) for the following reasons:

1. Good components - components are excellent, and the hexagonal map is modular allowing for different set-ups each time [variability]

2. Mechanics - well thought out and put together, which work really well with the theme, and more importantly has a fair degree of player interaction even during other players turns

3. Simple and logical rules - concise and build upon the theme and mechanics. Very cohesive

4. Interaction - fair degree of player interaction through trading, blocking roads, and moving the robber

It may be fashionable in some quarters to bash Settlers for its success and market penetration, it still holds up as a worthwhile game (unless you detest any form of luck in games), is still relevant, worthwhile, and fun to play now. 

Settlers is no longer an automatic shoe-in as the default gateway game (testament to the vast range of excellent games available), however it is a worthwhile choice as a gateway game. One that I still enjoy playing (unlike TTR, which wore out its welcome after 2 plays).

Critically acclaimed, and with good reason. One of the oldest Euros, but still one of the greatest. So many ways to victory, with great screwage throughout. It never gets old, and the balance of building and trading for VP is perfect. Definitely has lasting power.

RATING: 3
Starting point of my euro-games experience. However, I quickly realised that the luck factor of this game was ruining my experience with this game. If the numbers on which your settlements are established do not come out, you might as well pack your things and watch the others play. Since Settlers was released, many building & trading games have been able to remove, more or less completely, the luck factor, in favor of simple ability and skill to manage resources.

Players: 3-4
Time: 60-90 min.

Players place settlements on the island of Catan and attempt to build cities, roads and armies to be the first to 10 points. Players acquire goods to build these through lucky dice rolls and trading with other players. In addition, a robber roams the island and steals resources. Losing players can use the robber to catch up to the current points leader.

Good game.  Will likely not turn it down if someone suggests it, but also will probably not suggest it unless someone hasn't played a "real" boardgame before.  Like the trading aspect and like the building.

Made better by Cities and Knights.

Update Jan 2015: Played this game with my brothers over Christmas.  Awesome.  Simple enough for everyone to come up to speed quickly and liquor-fueled trading interaction was great.  And I really like how the development cards provided another path to victory if someone was locked out of building cities.  This game is classic and should be the game the general population points to when they think of "boardgames" and relegate Monopoly to the dustbin of history.

this game is simply but a good introduction to euro type games.  Combines trading with with area control in a easy to understand package.  I gotten many non-gamers to play this.  There is a bit of a run away problem if the die rolls don't work out to get you resources  and there is no catch up mechanic but just keep up if you can.  Games can also run a little long for what it is.

Like most people, this was my first introduction to Designer Games and I really enjoy it. The game does grow stale after a while, however, as I found the winning strategy of cornering the market on a frequent resource type and securing the associated port, all in the opening turn.

I also find that I don't like the 5-6 player expansion as much. It's too long and the island gets too restrictive, often cornering players into a weak position and preventing their advancement.

Settlers of Catan with all its variants, is in my opinion perhaps the finest board game ever designed. Whereas Twilight Struggle and Through the Ages are both very flawed games which are insanely highly rated on Board Game Geek, Settlers of Catan is an unflawed masterpiece of game design. This should be rated #1 on BGG instead of #100.

When 25-30% of the people rating Twilight Struggle have never even played the game and the game reinforces American political delusions and thus is quite harmful in fostering such prejudices; in contrast Settlers of Catan is pure gold deserving of the number one rating when all of the hype from BGG is cut through.

My wife and one of our gaming friends both absolutely love Settlers (which I find strange - both are experienced gamers), so there was quite a long period where I was forced to play it on an approximately weekly basis (that has thankfully stopped, the game now only gets played when they have someone else to play it with). As you can probably guess, I've never been a fan. To be fair, it's not that bad as a game, what is there works reasonably well - but there's nothing particularly good or interesting about it, and any individual game is too dependent on the dice rolls (or other luck like which cards get stolen). And it throws up incredibly frustrating moments, like finally getting that brick when a 5 was rolled for the first time all game, only for an opponent to play a monopoly card for it before you can use it. Or getting picked on even when you're already doing terribly, just because the opponent who just rolled 7 knows that one of your 2 cards is that precious wheat. And many many more. I can understand why this game became popular 20 years ago, but really, even for a gateway game there are dozens (at a very conservative estimate) of better and more fun ones around now.

This game took many plays for me to warm up to it. It was really through playing 2-player games with my wife that I began to enjoy it. Because it is such a classic game responsible for drawing so many people into gaming, I had to keep trying.

The game can be long and a bit tedious with 4, especially if the dice aren't rolling well, but with 2 and 3 I like it. 

Update: It really is a great game.

Pre-Catan, I used to like Board Games, but wouldn't have really been that into them.
Post-Catan, I realised that what I knew of board games was very out-dated. 

I'd say that my experience of playing Catan is similar to so many people. Our friends introduce us to Catan and it serves to bridge the gap in our appreciation for board games. We realise that Monopoly, Cluedo and Game of Life are not really "good" games at all. We realise that player elimination is a bad thing. We learn that the mechanics of the new wave of board games are so much more of an experience than what we had as kids. Most of all, we learn that board games are now really fun!

The mechanics of the game are very simple, but can bring out great strategy. Luck can be a factor, as in any game with dice, but dice go both ways in games. Of course, good strategy and luck with dice can be overcame by players scheming and grouping up against one player - so it's always unlikely that one player will always win!

While I don't get to play Catan as often anymore, I'm still usually happy to join a game when it's suggested. And for a new gamer, it is still part of my armory to try and get them hooked. 

Catan will now and forever occupy a favorable place in my memories of gaming!

Minha nota do Catan vai aumentando conforme eu fico sem jogá-lo. Acho que é um jogo que na minha memória, talvez por ter sido o primeiro, parece mais divertido do que realmente é. Aí fatalmente um dia eu jogo e a graça se esvai um pouco. Continuo gostando bastante, mas não deixa de ser uma decepção.

E a edição da Grow, com pecinhas de plástico em vez de madeira, tira muito da graça.

There was a time when this game would have garnered a 10, because it deserves recognition as one of the very best.  But, after our group played this thing for months on end, every Friday night, we found it getting pretty stale.  It still gets an 8 for being the game that inspired us to meet weekly for gaming.  A great game for all (even my parents like it and play it occassionally).  A bit pricey (but then so are all of these German games).

I recognize that it is a well designed game. But I just have no desire to play it again.

[COLOR=#00CC99]CO[/COLOR] This is weird game. It could be good, but there's really high factor of randomness (or whathever it's called in English). I'm usually sitting for half a game without getting any resources unable to play anything just staring at others enjoying the game, while I'm bored to death. Yeah, I'm really unlucky with dices so I'm trying to avoid games where they are used much - unfortunately I'm unlucky at that too (or is there any other reason for that, Vezna? ;)).

So, I like the idea of the game and I can understand why people like it so much, but for me - in this form - it's one big NO.

Purchased the Spanish version. The European manufacture is better than the American IMO. Even though the game's theme isn't everyone's cup of tea, it's still a great game with enough luck and strategy that it doesn't become boring or dull. The randomization of tiles is a pretty cool system.
The only problem is when you pick up a place with less frequent numbers for your first settlements, since these will be the foundations of your entire game. It's crucial to understand dice statistics before playing, otherwise it can be very frustrating for some players. A very good and fun game, overall.

Warning: Nasty review about a weak game. Do not buy it!

Catan is the game that singlehandedly delayed me from getting into board gaming by some 10 years. 

Catan was all my few boardgaming friends wanted to play back in high school. Which made me stick to computer and videogames for my gaming fix. Because I like having fun, I don't like dying inside.

Even today I have friends who love it. And honestly, I've judged them terribly in silence. With time, however, I've come to realize that they simply haven't played any good games and thus have no basis for comparison. Which is a mitigating factor for sure. Because if getting punched in the face is all you know it's probably not that bad. (Some of them own Carcassonne though... and I would rather live in a Carcassone big box for a year than play a game of Catan. So I don't get that.).

Playing Catan is like religion because all you do is pray, hope and wait for that unlikely miracle. (I also tend to think alot about death and the afterlife while playing.) You don't really have any meaningful choices. Either you get the rolls you need, or you don't. Either you buy the thing you can afford, or you wait until you can afford the other thing. Either people want to trade resources with you or they don't. There is really very little you can do to affect the game aside from refusing someone a trade or placing the robber. Where to build is the only choice of any importance. And it is a rare occurence.

The game was weak when it came out and is hopelessly dated today. If you want an easy dice chucking game, get Champions of Midgard or something.

I guarantee that if you take just 15 minutes to look you will find a game you'll have more fun with than Catan. All the other classic gateway games are better. Even Yahtzee has more meaningful choices. Rock-paper-scissors has greater replay value. An afternoon nap is more exciting.

Don't get it!

The copy in our collection is my girlfriends. Thankfully she quickly realized its utter worthlessness when introduced to mediocre-or-better games.

 Excellent introduction to german games for a number of reasons:       The number of brain parts stimulated in the game is large, though stimulation is fairly gentle.  This is not your hitachi magic wand vibrator that focuses on one organ and wiggles the hell out of it. no.  it's more like a vibrating tub of warm, soft jello that you jump into hairless and naked, all nerve endings exposed. there's cajoling, laughter, tension, secrets and bluffing, memory, press your luck, arms races, strategic thinking, tactical considerations, the joy of building.     there's just a *little* viciousness, enough to make the game juicy, but not enough to provoke any real hurt feelings (for most people).    virtually zero downtime for anybody, as everyone is interested in everything that happens at all times.   the game has been designed to give every person playing the hope of winning at all times, even if it's the smallest glimmer.  the person that is waay too far in the lead can be effectively slowed down by other players, leading to close, tense finishes.  Some here have argued that this aspect makes it an inferior game, as skill is constantly being stymied by luck and group-lynching, but I believe that a game for non-gamers should allow everyone the possibility of winning.    

 On the minus side, the start-up is intimidating (to a non-gamer), as rules are moderately complicated, and the board looks geeky, with the hexagons and #s and pips.  But most non-gamers with whom I've played have warmed to the game after playing just two rounds, and are extremely enthusiastic (and exhausted) by the end.  Complexity is an issue, however, for grandma or grandpa who have trouble with all the rules.

De spelers strijden tegen elkaar om de grootste kolonisatiemacht uit te bouwen op het eiland Catan. Dit doen ze door het bouwen van wegen, dorpen en steden. Hiervoor hebben ze vele grondstoffen nodig, die ze verkrijgen door het strategisch bouwen van de vernoemde nederzettingen (een aangrenzend bosgebied levert bijv. hout op), maar ook door onderlinge onderhandeling.

Fell in love with this game as the first Eurogame I played.  Still think it is the best game to introduce 'Monopolists' to for converting them to better gaming.

Played it a lot before I started recording plays.

This was my gateway game into the world of Eurogames. The first time I played it I was blown away. There is, indeed, a lot to like in this game: trading, route building, player interaction, blocking, long term strategy, short term tactics, etc... However, the more I played it, the less I enjoyed it. Especially after I became a more experienced Eurogamer. It took me a while to figure out what I didn't like, and I think what it comes down to is the simple fact that- when everything is boiled down- the key to winning the game is simply getting more of the correct resources than other players in order to build quicker than them. How do you get resources? They are randomly dealt out through dice rolls. Sure you can play the probabilities, but that doesn't always help. I've played most of a game without an 8 being rolled. It's in the "Monopoly" mold of distributing currency randomly. I didn't like it in that game and I don't like it here either. You can plan and carefully line up your pieces, but it doesn't matter if the dice don't roll your number. You are at the mercy of the dice for nearly everything in this game. The simple fact is that some people get more resources through sheer luck and not due to good or smart play. I really don't mind randomness in games, but having your entire economy run by random dice results is ludicrous. Looking at the game now, it looks to me like the whole trading aspect was simply added on to try and fix the inherently broken economy of the game and isn't entirely successful.

Then there is the fact that this game is just much too long. After I came to the realization that it was the dice that bothered me, I bought the dice deck of cards which evens out the luck. After playing it with those cards, I found my experience with the game didn't really improve much. Perhaps I'm simply burned out on the game, but for me Catan is a trial to get through. It drags on and the fun is over long before the game is.

For some reason, this game has never resonated with me.  I can see the various aspects of the game that appeal (trading, building, etc)...but all of my plays have left a cold feeling with me.  When I win I feel it was more due to luck than any skill.  When I lose, just glad the game is over.

Too much of the game relies on the luck of the die to get goods.  Sure one can trade for more, but all too often at too great a price as others don't have to trade.

An almost perfect game. Mechanics are beautifully elegant, plays very quickly (40~60m with my group), negotiation makes the game very fun and interactive.

A great game nonetheless. Strongly recommend it for light gamers.

The best game for you if you don't play board games. Friends and girls love it. Best trading and social game so far (if you let it). Never get mad to the dice. Just have fun playing. A little to much luck but you can use some variants to put it in check. I advise you 2 new house rules:

If you don't receive any resource, place a token (Catan doesn't come with any, so add them to the game) in front of you. Once you have x tokens equal to your points, trade it (on your turn) for any resource. Tokens can't be stolen and don't count as cards in your hand.

If the same number (besides 7) rolls again (two times in a row), you MUST add or subtract, a value of 2, to the number (you choose, but can't never use a value of just 1). This rule is inspired from Elasund.

It's Catan. It's fun. We play it in a weird way, by mixing all the water tiles with the land tiles and playing with bridges that cost 1 wood, 1 brick, and 1 sheep to build a road across the water. Something about needing a sheep sacrifice to make a bridge. . . . Also makes sheep slightly more useful. 

Anyway, the reason I don't own the game is because everyone else does. Like literally everyone else.

I understand why some people mark it down after playing more sophisticated games but I think its balance of new ideas (when it came out), relatively short play time, accessibility (my 80 something parents can cope with it) and replayability (often obsessively on the internet in my case) make it an all-time classic.

I rarely win Catan, but I still have loads of fun. It is a strategist's game; someone who can loves looking at the board and predicting everyone's future moves and how to block them. It also has a decent amount of random luck, which, in my opinion, every game needs otherwise it would be like Chess. If I wanted to play chess, I would play chess.
Settlers of Catan is a timeless game. One that I can bring out and have fun with without any of the expansions. Personally I don't think it needs expansions, the core gameplay elements would be ruined I think if you threw in some crazy ideas. Then again, I can't really talk since I haven't played a whole lot of them.
Overall, Catan is a great game with great player interactions and great mechanics. Love it.

Rated 10 because this is the game that first brought me into the hobby (and BGG)... because after 10 years, this is still our family's favorite game.  It's easy, it's friendly, it's cooperative yet competitive, it's fun, and it finished in an hour.  This is what we still play when we can't decide what to play.  We usually stick with the basic game, rarely the expansions.  I don't believe that "no game should rate a 10" (if so, then why have a 10?)  This is it.

My personal gateway game.  The collecting, the trading, the building, the dice, the robber.  Before this, all I knew were Monopoly, Risk, Sorry, & Stratego.

RATING: 6
Decent game, but so frustrating and so much negative interaction!  So much of your success is dependent on the stupid dice and the willingness of your opponents to work with you.  This is the one game that we have played where we regularly come away from the game with negative feelings toward the people that we are playing with.  Board games should not be this way.  If we are going to play with people, we want everyone to have a good experience.  This is not that game.  Traded it away (with Cities and Knights) for the Village and the Village Inn.

Still a great game, what got me into Euros. I only rate it this low because I will always play Seafarers over straight Settlers, mainly because it is too easy for one player to get pushed into a narrow area, basically stuck in a losing position for the rest of the game and placed in a king-making position through who he/she prefers to trade with.

----------

This was my gateway game.  I played it and loved it for 2 years until I picked up Cities and Knights and Seafarers.  Cities and Knights has spoiled me... the base version is now too bland for my tastes, but this game is still a classic.  

If you would've asked me a rating 100 plays ago, it would've been a 10 all the way.  As it is now, I could care less if I ever played it again.

However, I'm keeping it in my collection so I can introduce friends to eurogaming in the future.

[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - I really enjoy this game.  I was inventive and bit ahead of its time.  I also think this games gets a lot of unwarranted crap from gamers.  It is an old game, but it still shines in my opinion.



Most certainly one of the better games ever made.  It is  a great gateway game and the game responsible for me being a big board gamer today.  The original is fine, but much better with Cities & Knights.  Always played with Cities & Knights and sometimes with the Great River and/or the Fisherman.  Rarely played with Seafarers and never with the event cards.

I just picked this up after wanting it for years. Now that I've played it, I have to say that its rather simple, and yet still a challenge. Random setup helps avoid the problem of starting in the exact place each time. I think I still prefer Civilization, but as a simplified version that lasts about an hour (play multiple times for the best experience) it's perfect.

RATING: 7
The old standby.  This game, like for so many others, was my entrance into the wonderful world of board games.  If you play it too much, it can get repetitive.  However, a short rest from Settlers is all you need to want to play it again.

Most importantly, Settlers is the biggest hit with my non-boardgaming friends.  It has been such a treat to have found a game with the universal appeal of mainstream games and the strategy/depth of a very good contemporary board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
--05Aug2004-- Bumped down to 7 due to increasing grumpiness with the effect of roll distributions on results.  While this is a really good gateway game - particularly for people that have been exposed to classic roll&move fare - there simply aren't enough rolls of the dice in a given game to even out a typically lumpy distribution.  As a result, a theoretically 'good' play can easily fail to be rewarded.  In the face of superior competition, then; there are other things that I would rather play.

THE "gateway" game. I have played this game with SO many people that would otherwise have known nothing about the genre of "euro gaming". And even many people who have never heard of that still know about this game from a random dinner party etc..., and ended up buying it. It is too simple and random to really feel like I am accomplishing anything if I win, but I still break it out when someone really wants. I'd much rather play cities and knights, and at the very least play the game online on asobrain.com because then it goes quicker.

Like many other geedos in China, I was lured into the Boardgame circle by the Settlers of Catan, the most classic Gateway game worldwide. Despite it is a game with many rules to memorize, and with a mechanic where the initial placement of settlements decide the winner (especially the no-trade version), Settlers of Catan are amazingly attracting and addictive. Now I have seen too many games, but still feel warm when looking back to the night when I set foot on the isle of Catan...

[color=#CC0000]

Every time I play I think I have it figured out, and as the game progresses I have to change my strategy.  The game is legendary, you owe it to yourself and to your kids to have a copy around the house.  Catch-phrases from Settlers are entering mainstream culture the same way "Do not pass Go" and "Free Parking" have from Monopoly.  This may be the one game from the last quarter of the 20th century to establish ubiquity.

The discussion after any game will give you a good clue about how good a play it is.  Settlers [b][i]always[/i][/b] produces a good post-game show.

--- trading between players
- Appropriate game length considering complexity

- Boring for player who positioned their settlement unwisely on the start or have bad luck with dices. But these games are often much faster so the misery is over soon.

This game got a lot of people interested in games for the first time.  It involves strategy, negotiation, luck, and fun.  Just look at the number of people who have voted on this game.  It's solid (although the 2 additional player expansion is a must).

A decent gateway game.  Can give newcomers a sense of competitiveness due to the luck, but the very same mechanism can leave veteran gamers feeling frustrated at bad luck and the length of the game.  Games that rely on luck based mechanisms really need to be a bit shorter play time.

+Cities and Knight's (8) - A favorite, one I miss playing.
+Seafarers (7) - makes for a nice change.
+Traders and Barbarians (8) - another favorite, a box-full of mini-expansions, both easy and more difficult. It's a Settlers Buffet.
+ Hexels (soon to have, can't wait)

Sadly, the worst game I ever played.
The game is decided on the throw of the initial dice. If you start, and make the right choice with your first pup, you win. If not, prepare for several hours of resignated frustration.

Instant classic.  Non gamers will like if they are analytical, very replayable.  Also very much fun with the expansions (particularly Seafarers, which allows for campaigning and variables such as "mystery" regions).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is very easy to learn, but not at all deficient in terms of strategic content. There is luck involved, but the strategy is based partly on understanding the probability distribution (the game and rules are designed to remind us of this ad nauseum) involved, and each game ought to provide a large enough sample of dice throws to have a fairly normal distribution.

It is not easy, however, to pick an optimal strategy. Like Go, it seems that this game cannot be reasoned out by brute force-- players must be able to adapt to their current situation and pick an optimal move using a sort of sliding time scale.

I have only played this game a handful of times, but I expect that I will continue to enjoy it and refine my strategy for a long time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Amazing fun, playable even with non-boardgamers.

EDIT: I still like the game a lot, but have moved it down from a 9 to a 7. It is great for playing with people who normally aren't into games. However, it does suffer from the problem that you can go for long stretches without being able to do anything because you get bad dice rolls for resources. I have nothing against luck in games, but sitting around waiting for your numbers to come up can be a bit dull.

[q="drunkenKOALA"]This is in large part due to the initial placement seriously dictating the (building) game.[/q]

RATING: 8
One of the games that brought my sister and me beyond the borders of the known boardgame world. When we were kids, my mom used to play the Catan computer game, and when she found a copy of the boardgame at a local toy store, she bought it and taught it to us during our weekly summer holiday in the Austrian Alps. From then on, for about ten years, we would be playing Catan all week long while on holiday - but not during the year. This changed in the last few years, when I got more involved in boardgaming, and we've played Catan during a weekend now and then.

Even though this game could be considered old, I think it still holds up against its competitors nowadays. Catan has become a well-known game in the mass-market, and I think that's a good thing.

I like the game. Even if you're losing, you can still set your own small goals, achievements to be reached in your own personal struggle. I also like that the level of 'viciousness' is completely adaptable to the group's desires, while still staying within the framework of the rules: I once had a player who allowed another player to decide where he'd put the robber, as long as that other player promised to make a certain trade with him during that turn - on the other hand, I've also had games where the robber got parked out of harm's way because the player decided everyone had been punished enough by having to discard half of their cards.

There's an interesting variety of strategies available to players: will you invest in long road networks to grab and hold the longest trading route, or buy develoment cards in search of victory points (and the biggest army), work towards building up your infrastructure with many villages (preferable on tile numbers that already grant you resources) or upgrade your villages into large cities?

This may sound weird, but Catan leaves me room to develop a story. An epic tale about how the different civilizations on the island flourish or wither away. One remarkable thing about our copy, by the way, is that the red - statistically most likely to be rolled - numbers often get rolled less than the weird numbers with low oddes, like 2's, 11's or 12's.

N.B.: I also prefer the wooden bits from my old copy over the ones from the wooden 15 year anniversary edition (though the wooden resource and number tiles are cooler) and especially over the plastic ones from newer editions.

Like for many people, this was my gateway game; I remember holding the rulebook for the first time and thinking how impressive it was that any game could have so much material to learn.  I had a lot of fun with the game and introducing it to all my friends allowed me to bring them into the hobby with me.

Now, the game only gets played occasionally.  Is it a good game?  I think so, I guess, but I don't feel particularly compelled by it anymore.  I may have become too familiar with it, and maybe the same thing would happen with some of my current favourites if I were to play them as much and as often as I did Catan, but I have a feeling the games that I now rank among the best have a little something, or maybe a few things, that Catan just doesn't bring to the table.

Catan is sometimes enjoyable, but always outclassed. Other economically focused games have more interesting engines, and other negotiation heavy games have meatier negotiations.

Catan suffers from a long list of relatively minor problems that add up to create an unnecessarily frustrating gameplay experience. Trading is hampered by the fear of the "Monopoly" gambit, bad die rolls can punish good strategies unfairly, and bash the leader elements ensure the game goes out with a whimper.

I played the Settlers of Catan game for a few times and I really enjoy it. It can be explained in five minutes and noone is bored waiting for his turn because the game is pretty fast. The biggest disadvantage though is the extremly big random element, which seem to be kingmaking just one player... Weird.

I like the game a lot but there's so many more doors to be opened in this hobby, that I don't see myself playing this again unless it's for recruitment purposes.

01/20/16: Played it again after a long time and I really enjoyed it. Hunting down a copy of the Seafarers expansion now. Feels good to be excited with this game again. It's a one of a king experience and am glad that my g/f talked me into keeping it. More to come after I try Seafarers.

26th Birthday from Sarah & Matt

We first played this game at our friend Rich's house as 3 couples. We were all new players although had heard of it because of the TV show The Big Bang Theory "I need wood".  As a party game with lots of people fighting for resources and to build as quickly as possible we had great fun and raved about it to other friends.

So quite unexpectedly on my my birthday the friends I had raved about it too had bought it for me. We've played this many more times than I have recorded and still love haw tactical you have to be to scoop a win from under your opponents noses many times it has come down to the final roll.

I've just purchased the first add on for this game seafarers so I'm looking forward to adding an extra dimension to the game.

A classic, so whatever I have to add to its rich history by commenting will ultimately be reduntant. Still, the game's abstract nature is alright, but lacks appeal to me. Not a big fan of wood playing pieces. Nicely balanced, though, and easily learned. Not a spectacularly original game, but well made and possibly handy for getting your non-gaming SO and relatives to the playing table. Otherwise, I've got more rewarding titles to spend my time on.

I have played this game with all of its expansions more times than I can possibly count.  Early on it was great fun because it was my first venture into strategic gaming.  My friends and I played multiple evenings every week.  However, as we progressed we realized the fatal flaw of this game--the heavy weight of the dice rolls.  You can have great strategy and still lose horribly if there is a string of rolls that don't go your way.  This is especially maddening when you choose the numbers that should be rolled more frequently like sixes or eights and someone else wins because they set up shop on threes and they got rolled a ridiculous amount.  I still play this game occasionally, usually when we are hanging out with people that aren't as used to strategic games.  It is a good game to use to cut your teeth on, but it has little value to grow with the player over the years.

For what it's worth, Settlers is honestly a great game. However, after playing many, many plays over the last few years, I have to say that I will only play this with a very specific set of friends because it's no longer very interesting otherwise.

This game tricks me in to thinking I like it. I like playing the Hoffmaniosis and sailing around the world, but then the game ends just as I'm starting to think I'm building up an Empire. Then I remember its a dumb game where you put roads and stuff on a map. Make those hexes planets and asteroids, turn roads and houses into space ships, let me blow stuff up and game would be good. Ooh... Twilight Imperium...

I've played this a couple times now - not bad, but for my money, there are game mechanics that I enjoy a lot more.  Not enough player interaction, and just too much sitting around waiting for cards.  (Anyone got brick to trade?  C'mon, some brick?  No...?  Boo-urns.)

I really really wanted to like this game, but I just don't. I hate that it's all about dice rolls (you can't trade if you never have any resources to begin with!) and that someone is always shafted.

I like it alright.  It seems to take us longer than we expect it to which is a huge downside.  We rarely have the 1.5-2.5 hours to play a game.

I just find that the luck factor is too much in this game.  If you get down early it's nearly impossible to make a come back no matter how hard you try.

I know it's a classic but I just can't get in to it.

I'll always have a sentiment for this game, as it was the first modern euro I played and played it more than once till early morning with friends. A great blend of strategy, luck and high interaction, both positive and negative, makes it a timeless classic still worth recommending.

I'm not that likely to play it again at my stage of the hobby though, at least without cities&knights and exchanging dice for cards.

Like a gazillion other people, my first euro, and a "so that's what all the fuss is about" moment. Nice to see the Kings & Things board again. Not something I'm that interested in playing, but definitely one of the first games that springs to mind to introduce people to the hobby.

The one classic game you must have in your collection. Easy to learn, much more fun than Monopoly and a great family game. Expansions are great as well. Must buy! This will help you to introduce other games to non-gamers, as they will realize there is so much more out there than Monopoly and Risk. Gets even better with the [GAMEID=926] expansion.
THE Gateway game, if there ever was one.

RATING: 7
Settlers of Catan is a classic board game predicated on resource trading and area control and is fun for older children. I have played it with a variety of people and would say that it is suitable for 12+. It can get a little serious for an gateway board game and I have had people lose it because they have been directly hindered by another player's actions. It is not as bad as Diplomacy, however. It is a game that probably works the best on its own and doesn't really need any expansions. Best played with 3 or 4 works fine too. Further expansions such as Cities & Knights actually change the flavour of the game as opposed to adding to it.

I think this is a great game for playing with certain light gamers. It serves as a benchmark by which all my games are rated.

This can degenerate into a really mean game in the right (wrong) crowd. There's the potential for one sided trades to assist blocking the leader, multiple bashing the leader on the same turn through the black knight, etc. I only want to play this one with the kids - keep it away from the serious competitive gamers.

I really can't stand the Mayfair edition - I don't like the colours and why does the ore symbol on the player mats use the same colour as the clay bricks?

What can I say that hasn't been said yet about this game?  A classic, the cause of Eurogames' boom, a really good game.  Players are colonists in an island trying to develop roads, towns and cities getting and using different raw materials, trading and avoiding thieves.

I had to play this game ~40 times before it began to lose some of its luster.  Very fun.  Pretty much all of the ~2 dozen people I taught this to were enamored with it.  A very good gift for a kid who watches too much TV (any of those out there?)

RATING: 10
The grand-mother of Euro games and up there with Ticket to Ride as the best gateway game out there.  Dice rolls produce resources, for each player on every turn, that they can trade or use to build bigger roads, settlements and cities for VPs and even more resources.  An accelerating game, it is always a sprint at the end, rather than a crawl like American counterpart games.  And must have addition to any gaming closet.

I loved this game when I first got it but then I started playing with really pushy manipulative people who just tried to pressure you into trades or talk other people out of trades which kind of ruined it for me.

Although I've gotten a little burnt out on it, it being my first Euro and something I've played many, many times, I have to give Settlers it's due. There's a reason why it's called a monopoloy-killer. It got me into Euro games, and its gotten thousands of people into the hobby. It's a great gateway game, if not the best.

I have a little, personal game hall of fame.  It's got nice lighting, cool exhibits, plaques on the walls - you should see it.  Anyway, Settlers of Catan is an inductee, so I suppose it should be a 10. But, it really isn't for me.  I feel like I've "played it out", if you know what I mean.  But, I still think it's a great game which I happily play.  Always tough decisions between spending resources for the cheap things (roads and cards) and saving them for the big ticket items.

This is a very fun game with the right group of people, because of the high amounts of social interaction between the players that the game encourages. You can trade resources with your opponents, you can gang up on other opponents, you can have all sorts of fun scheming & strategizing with (or against) other players. If you have a rowdy group of friends, this is probably the game to take out. Lots of fun.

Lacking in deep strategy, Catan regardless lives on.  It is a game about dice rolls, and unlike Monopoly, there isn't anything anyone can really do to stop a run away leader.  It did, however, evolve the board game industry from Mass Market monsters to the current standards, so we all owe it a bit of gratitude.

After hearing so much about this game, I was expecting a lot more. So much luck that the odds of rolling 2 through 12 are given in the instructions! Not what I had expected; not much strategy - just roll the dice, hope for the best, and get some good trades.

RATING: 8
I'm not saying anything new when I call this game a classic. I like to play with a random hex and number setup. The game is easy to setup and play, and offers quite a bit of strategic depth. Dice adds a little luck to the mix, but only over the short term. How do I maximize my resources? Should I compete for the biggest army or biggest road bonuses? UPDATE: Dropping my rating from 10 to 8.5, since there are so many other games I'd rather bring to the table before this. Still a great game.

UPDATE Jul-12-2010: Dropping it solidly to an 8, since this game fails the "always want to play it" test. Also, I think I was mad to say the game has only a "little luck." The game often never gets to the "long term" for the resources to even out -- it's only played to 10 points.

I really need to get a newer edition of this game. The '96 Mayfair edition has some visual design issues that make it difficult for new players to tell the resources apart. Specifically, A. the hexes and cards are all photographs (and dark, at that) and B. there are different images for the terrain (e.g., forest hex) and the resource (e.g., timber). The resource is illustrated as a circle. The player aid shows the resource circles only, and of course the hexes just show the terrain, but the resource cards have both. I was aiming for a conversion of an older player into a gamer, but instead I turned him off to "complicated" games such as this. :(

What can anyone say about this game? I think that every board gamer should own it...You will always find people to play it and love it...The only disadvantages of the game are 1.the 4th and sometimes the 3rd place in the middle of the game are obvious and almost withdrawn from competition (they get bored...) basically due to 2. The starting positions are extremely crucial and if you make a mistake or you are cut off it's almost impossible to win and 3. Only 4 players can play it. Ok these disadvantages seem little serious but all in all the game is GREAT. Fun, arguments, strategic play, screwing others and negotiations guarantee a pleasant time, satisfaction in the end and multiple plays in the future...

PS For me it is also an entry into the more strategic games out there.

This is a breakthrough hit for a reason. Very accessible to anyone new to the hobby, but it also has enough strategy and variables to entertain more veteran players.

The game that got me started on the voyage of board gaming... this game took the original idea of board gaming and turned it upside down on its head. Certainly, games of its caliber had existed before, but this raised the bar for how gamers while away their hours. Also helping it was the fact that it is very newbie friendly. Its greatest strengths are its elegant simplicity and variable map board. It has enough building and options to keep you entertained. It is criticized heavily for randomness in the dice rolls though, but that doesn't bother me too much.

Rather average. The game feels too random, and the negotiations are not interesting.

I'm torn. Settlers was the game that got me over the mainstream board game hurdle of boring themes, humdrum mechanics, and player elimination. Settlers also introduced me to variable boards, wooden pieces, and victory points. But... Settler's role as a gateway game also hurts it in the long run because there are so many more games out there that really make Settlers feel kind of, well, boring. I only play this now if I am in a very specific mood. And if there aren't better games within reach.

Settlers of Catan moved me from Chess into board games. If I mess up in Chess, it's my fault and I am punished through the rest of the game. In Settlers of Catan, if I mess up, I have many options to recover. Let's face it, Settlers is the best game out there. People complain about luck and dice and, well, that's life, suck it up. This allows experts to have an advantage, but it always allows other players to be included. Strategy, interaction, little downtime, re-playability - Settlers of Catan has it all. Don't let people complain about thinking that it has too much luck. It is good to lose sometimes, even though you are as prepared as possible. This got most of us into board games, and is available everywhere for good reason.

The basic game is great, but the myriad variations and expansions make this one of the best games, period. Easy to learn, not so easy to master.

If you haven't played Catan and play board games, what are you waiting for?

Played it on and off since 2003ish.  Hits the table a couple times a month now(2016) and it is still fun enough. The randomness of the rolling/acquiring of resources is usually what makes me want to avoid this game.  Still a decent game for new groups and casual groups, but I would much rather play intro games like Pandemic or King of Tokyo instead. 

After a lot of play in early/mid 2016, we took a break from it and now it is pretty hard to get back into after playing more modern games. Moving rating from a 6 to a 5.  Still playable, but just barely.

RATING: 8
Don't believe the negative hype from many other BGGeeks!: this is a solid game, and it should replace all others as the introduction to modern designer board games. It's dirt-simple, and it's balanced like a dream. I rarely have games finish that aren't incredibly tight.
Don't let the group get addicted to it; pull out Alien Frontiers or Small World to get them into something slightly more advanced.
But think about the Milton Bradley games you may have grown up on... all the roll and moves and totally one-sided games of Monopoly. Then consider that you can buy Settlers at most major department stores. We live in a golden age, people.

RATING: 6
A great game to introduce to people who only know MB style games - open up a whole new world to them!  A few too many rules for non-gamers, but otherwise a game people ask for over and over again.  Because of it's popularity there are tons of workable variants on rules, plus expansions.  If a piece of the gameplay bugs you, it's easy to find a variant that fits you better.

Updated Score 06/05. I think this game is finally showing it's age. With games like Puerto Rico out there, I'm wanting to pull this off the shelf less and less. Used to think it was a good game for introducing non-gamers to the hobby, but feel there are now even better games for this, but SoC is still a good choice in this case.

Once a family favorite, it has been a while since we played. My sisters-in-law, and a good friend of ours tend to dominate. My wife won the very first time she played. Somehow, I spend most of the game with the robber on my most lucrative spots and the when the pirates land I am a knight short. Sound familiar?

I can't praise this game enough. It has HANDS DOWN the best player interaction out of any game ever made.

People criticize it for having too much luck, but that just means they aren't very good at it. If you play well, the dice should be heavily mitigated.

The only real flaw with this game is that it's pretty easy to get completely shut out within the first few turns if someone blocks you. This can particularly happen in a 4 player game. Generally this only happens if there are some newbies at the table though.

This is a big hit with my non-gamer friends. That alone is enough for me to want to play it. The initial setup was a little confusing and some rules we had to keep looking up.

It's like a mature version of Monopoly. People have complained about the die rolling, but I have no problem with it. Getting screwed by a die roll only really affects you if you only play the game once, or once in a long while. When you like a game and play it frequently, then it's no big deal if you lose 1 game to a bad die roll. 

Quite frankly, it should take more than just a couple bad die rolls to lose a winning game... people who say they lost to bad rolls probably weren't going to win anyway.

11/12/07: It's been quite some time now since I fully agreed with the above statement. After playing a lot more eurogames, I have gotten way too sick of the frustration associated with being on the 5, 6, 8, and 9 and still not getting resources all game.

The game's pretty meaningless with anything other than 4 players, and it certainly does get old after awhile, though since friends own Cities+Knights and Seafarers, those definitely help keep things fresh.  My only real complaint is that the robber is quite devastating early in the game, especially if the dice aren't behaving and another seven doesn't pop up for ages.

I want to hate this game, I really do.

But I gave it 6 stars because of how many friends I have that really enjoy this game for some reason. I'll play with them, I can manage, and even have a small amount of fun, but I usually hate this game.

Why?

It's nothing but luck with a dash of strategy.

Most games that are out now a day have a way to mitigate bad dice luck, take a look at Dead of Winter for instance.

This game however, it doesn't matter if you have settlements in good locations, bad dice rolls in a row, top with players who are specifically targeting you make this game terrible.

So why 4 stars?

It's such a basic and easy game to get into that you could teach this to a stick and it would be able to play. The simplicity and small learning curve allows for players of all ages and all types to have fun while engaging in this game.

I don't reccomend it.

Play something else, I'll even recommend Pandemic (A game I don't particularly enjoy) over this. There are so many better games out there that are casual, involve strategy, and are better executed.

This review is based off of the core set, it may be subject to change if expansions change my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My gateway game. Still fun, because I never played the snot out of it, like a lot of other people did. Initial placement is everything. I don't like to play with 4 players, as it seems to screw up the end-game, and the extra negotiation and downtime can make it not worthwhile. One of my favorite things to do in all of board gaming is to plan for and play the Monopoly card.

4+2

This is a game I have never tired of.  I really enjoy the trading element.  However, this can be annoying when playing with someone who will not really trade.  In my experience, the dice do not beat people with superior play.  Sure people have dry spells from time to time, but you have to adapt.  Those who adapt best, win.  Same goes with being shut out.  I have only seen one time where a person was truly shut out of a game, and he could probably have still competed -- if he had actually tried.  All in all, a lot of fun.  For the record, Seafarers is not my cup of tea and C&K is not on my desired to play list.

One of my all-time favorites, but gameplay time can be a big restricting factor. I feel that a 3 person game moves very nicely, but going up to 5-6 players (with the 5-6 player expansion) makes the game really drag out as everyone makes their decisions. 

That said, I love playing this game, and find it very versatile for making up / playing new variations with just the base. My 9-year-old twin daughters grasp the game just fine and have even figured out good strategies on their own which have lead to wins

Catan is a very good family game, but after several games it lacks of depth for me. I also bought expansion : Traders and barbarians and we almost never play without it now. But still if you get a bad position at a start , you sometimes already know who's gonna win at the end. But if you are new to board games or looking for a family game , i recommend Catan.

You know... this is a darn good game.  I periodically get reminded of that when some of my friends (who are much bigger fans) force me to play it.  Makes for an enjoyable evening.

Best features:
1. Gaining resources on other players' turns (partial reinforcement schedule).
2. Spatial element of map. Worrying about which direction to build in, being cut-off, possible ports to utilize, etc.
3. Use of the Robber to keep the leader in check. 

Worst features:
1. Drags on too long, esp. if people haggle over trades.
2. Repetitive, without much of an "arc".

[COLOR=#006600][b]Comments: [/b][/COLOR]

We [b][i]always[/b][/i] play with a variant I found on an old version of Herr Teuber's site.  (I haven't seen this particular variant listed anywhere in the years since.)  As in "Poverty Is No Dishonor", a player who receives no resource on any single dice-roll receives a chip.  On his turn, if he has as many chips as he has visible points, he must trade them in to the bank for a resource of his choice.  This mitigates luck and helps less as a player's position becomes stronger.  I would not rate this game so highly if we did not play with this variant.

[COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR] 

This game is comfort-food for my gamer's soul.  In all the years since discovering Settlers, I think it's fair to say that almost all of our game purchases have been in the hopes of finding other games that please us as much as Settlers.

 [COLOR=#006600] • 5 players: [/COLOR] Not good
 [COLOR=#006600] • 6 players: [/COLOR] Not good

[COLOR=#006600]Instructions: [/COLOR]It's been years since I've read the rules, but I do recall feeling daunted by the separate rules and almanac booklets in the third edition.  That much printed material made the game seem more complex than it actually is.  I do appreciate the distinction between rules (for learning the game) and almanac (for clarifying details).  The fourth edition was printed in color, making the illustrations that much more helpful.
[COLOR=#006600]Learning Curve: [/COLOR] Rather involved, yet intuitive.  In only a couple of rounds, a new player will have the gist. (Best to learn from an experienced player, rather than from the rulebook.)
[COLOR=#006600]Depth: [/COLOR]Placement and expansion are quite strategic, but the social aspects dominate.
[COLOR=#006600]Luck: [/COLOR]Dice can be cruel, so initial placement is crucial.
[COLOR=#006600]Downtime: [/COLOR]Production and trading affect all players on all turns, so downtime is minimal.  Some friends have complained that the game bogs down during the trading phase. 
[COLOR=#006600]Fiddliness: [/COLOR]Set-up is a bit fiddly.
[COLOR=#006600]Components: [/COLOR]Some editions are sturdier than others, but they're all attractive.
[COLOR=#006600]Player Interaction: [/COLOR]Trading is at the heart of this game, so player interaction is high.
[COLOR=#006600]Conflict: [/COLOR]Particularly in a four-player game, room to expand can be tight.  This often means players will block one another's roads.
[COLOR=#006600]Theme: [/COLOR]The theme is rather diffuse: settling a new land, and expanding and improving one's holdings.  The mechanics represent the theme well.

This is a well done game. Balanced, takes 2 hours, and most important - it is a social game! We have fun with every couple we introduce this game to. It's nice combination of strategy, luck, ignorance ("I don't care who is first, I need sheep!"), and what I personally love - it allows different strategies. What's not to love?

Played some other games and now I really appreciate one for me the most important attribute of tSoC - it's very social, superb blend of group play and competitiveness.

This was my gateway game and brought me back into the hobby after playing my last boardgames in my early teens. A very well designed game about trading and settling an island. It's been extremely successful with other groups and my copy has served as its own gateway game for several other people. After playing so many other games since, the shine has worn off this one for me a little. Having said that, I'll always come back to this if we add in the Cities and Knights expansion.

This was my gateway game.  I first played this in mid 2005 and I've been hooked ever since.  The resource system is great, and the trading can lead to some very interesting round-table politics and scheming.  

This game gets even better with the expansions, I'm particularly fond of Cities and Knights, although Seafarers is also a nice touch.

After 6 games over a period of 3 years, I have warmed up to Settlers, if only by a little. I think my first victory, after a history of consistently finishing last, may have had some effect on my outlook on this. 

I don't disagree with the general positive assessments of the game – it teaches casual gamers about resource collection and conversion, it's interactive and has a good sense of progress. But the fun only lasts as long as your luck is at least average. If dice rolls don't go your way early on and you end up lacking resources. Playing a trading game without the capacity the actually [i]trade[/i] due to bad luck is a horrid way of spending an hour.

The first german game I played. Settlers of Catan racked up a lot of playtime a couple of years ago, but I'm not as fond of it anymore than I used to. The dice affect the game pretty much and the negotiation/trading phase often drags for an unnecessarily long time. I don't see this as THE introductory game for new players anymore. There are lots of better options out there nowadays.

I love the game but too many games have ended with one person saying, "If there hadn't been 6 8's rolled before a single 6..."  Despite the luck factor of dice, the strategy involved with settlement placement and resource manipulation make for a very enjoyable 3-4 person game.

RATING: 10
The modular board and trading are fantastic mechanics for replayability and player interaction. Settlers provides a nice balance between long-term planning and randomness. Its always a thrill to have your cities start producing after clawing your way forward in the early game. 

I've always preferred vanilla Settlers to the expansions. For a so-called gateway game Settlers has a LOT of rules. Adding in expansions doesn't seem like a productive way to recruit new board game enthusiasts. Why complicate a fantastic game when you can pull out any number of other games that will introduce new mechanics?

ASIDE: I also have the Korean version (카탄), which is basically the Kosmos version. However, the new plastic mold pieces were missing from the box! If only I knew who to contact. Kosmos did not reply to my email. Oh well.

RATING: 7
[57 plays] The first German game I introduced to our family and friends. Stumbled onto it somehow in 1999 years before I discovered BGG. We played this nearly to death over the course of a year or two. In recent years it has come out one or two times each year for some fun and nostalgic play. This game deserves so much credit for the popular revival of intelligent boardgames in America. I would say more but it isn't necessary as there is just such a wealth of information out there on what a great game Settlers is both for casual play and introducing non-gamers to the world beyond Monopoly.

Enjoy the social play (although it can be mildly contentious), respect the game for how much it does for newcomers, and relax - knowing the whims of the dice can sometimes take control of much of your destiny.

Most recent play 12-31-09 -- a 4 player game with Barb, Tony, and Shelly.

Ah, the one that started it all. I actually don't have my copy of this anymore due to lending it to someone and never getting it back, but man did I play the crap out of this in High School. At the time, it offered so much that no other board game I had ever played did. It's still a good light-medium Euro in my opinion, and I would honestly be glad to play it if someone offered. That being said, since I am usually the one with and introducing the games, this gateway game will take a backseat when it comes to games like Pandemic or Ticket to Ride.

I didn't enjoy this game at all. Maybe I'd have a different opinion IF I had played Catan before getting to know modern board games.

The most well known gateway, if I could have my way I would prefer carcassonne or stone age to be the face of the king of modern gateway games. To be blunt, this game is outdated. Any game that rewards you for rolling a certain number to progress you in the game is outdated design. That's the biggest downfall of catan. Ive gone several rounds where my number didn't come up and all I was able to do was to beg an opponent to trade with me. As I sat there, I watched as my opponents were having the time of their lives filling up their hand with more resources than they can handle while I'm starving to have one of my numbers come up.

The classic German Game. Settlers is simple, interactive, and has good replay value. It's a nice entry level game, and I even got my non-gamer inlaws to like it. The downsides are that you're at the mercy of the dice rolls and initial positioning is crucially important. In fact, the most interesting decisions are made during the setup, before the game even begins. But I do like the trading system, and the game can be fun from time to time as a lighter alternative.

A classic.  Like many, I cut my teeth on German games with this and I have played it the most times of any of them.  It has its faults - a bad choice at the beginning can make for a long and painful game and I have rarely seen a game so able to bring the Whiner out in everyone (myself included!).  But for all this, it still regularly comes to the table and is welcomed.  Still fun to play after many games.  UPDATE: downgraded to 7 from 8.  I will still happily play this game (provided I haven't played it too much recently) but I won't suggest it.  Though it is a classic, there are better games, games in which you can actually do something on every turn, where a poor run of dice rolls don't leave you out of the game.  I really want more involvement in my gaming, but I will still play basic Settlers.  Expansions however I am less enthusiastic...

RATING: 3
Well, I've played this classic enough times now to give it a firm rating. I have to choose giving it a 3 because I really don't want to play it again. For starters, it's actually a rather long game given its very narrow decision tree. In Settlers, you roll the dice, and players with wooden blocks bordering tiles receive goods if the numbers on the tiles match the number on the dice. You also get opportunities to trade five different types of good, and an opportunity to build things. Building things gets you victory points, and the first player to ten victory points wins. Once your initial little houses or villages or whatever have been placed, it's in your best interests to focus on upgrading them to cities (which give you double goods on the correct dice rolls), build the longest road (which gives you a couple bonus points), and build more villages. But the game offers little in the way of long term strategy. You simply hope the rolls are good, try to get others to trade you what you need, and grind on. Of course, this simplicity is also what makes Settlers easy to teach, and has been a contributor to its success as a gateway game.

Settlers is an impressive game in some ways, foremost in that it's accessible. It also introduces gamers to trading, odds, and the concept of victory points. But it suffers from too many liabilities compared to the games it inspired. For me, it's kind of brain dead. I would much rather play one of Teuber's other games. There aren't many interesting decisions. Assuming a table of reasonably intelligent players, way too much of the outcome rests on initial village placement. So much so, that I now have no interest in playing. This isn't sour grapes on my part, but last game I played I had to watch my wife and one other player twiddle their thumbs for an hour because although they were still "playing" Settlers, they had no chance to win. None. Zip. It was like playing Monopoly when one player is clearly dominating, and everyone's just going through the motions until the end game condition has been met. This is a massive strike against Settlers, even more damning than the anemic play.

Catan... Every time I start playing it, I wonder why I haven't played it for a while: It's so fun! But then, by the time the game is half done, I remember why. The game is sloooow, as player after player asks everyone else if they want to trade, and discussions go back and forth... And then, if you get a bad start, you really have very little chance of getting back in the game, unless the dice gods favour you. So... nah. I'll play if asked, but I won't ask.

RATING: 6
Fun luck based game with some strategic decisions to be made.  Particularly important is the placement of your starting villages.  Good introduction to the hobby; however, I feel that this game wears thin with repeated playings.

Just revisited this one after a long hiatus, and the honeymoon is definately over.  I found myself bored shortly after the set-up.  Dropping Settlers down 1 point- I will play, but would rather be playing something else.

Catan, such a classic game. This is the definitive board gamer's game. It is expandable, full of strategy and is truly the definition of next level of board game beyond the Monopolys and Sorrys of this world. I have had a great deal of game nights in which the only game we played was Catan, and while I cannot say it is my all time favourite board game, I can say it is in the top 10. The only issues Catan struggles with is how brutal bad luck can be. Running low on luck (especially in the 4 or 6 player games) can make the game painfully slow and impossible to win if you get locked in.to a corner. This doesn't happen often to skilled players, but when it does it can just make the game drag on. I also added Harbor Master to the game and kept it at 10 points to win to keep things moving smoothly towards the end of the game. Overall, Catan is a classic everyone who is a gamer should own.

One of the classics that often introduce new players to a style of board game outside of the traditional American "Milton Bradley" games.

The type and feel of each game is very much dominated by the board set up and the personalities of the players.  Dice can dramatically swing the outcome of the game, so using the deck of cards instead of the dice can even out the distribution and help eliminate the "bad luck" component.  Personally, I feel that luck is a part of the game and figuring your way out of a crappy situation is part of the fun.

Great game to play again and again; and a great way to bring new players into Euro-style board games.

The first time I played Catan was in 2009, much after all the hype had gone down. I wasn't impressed. Much is left to luck, and if you're unlucky, your options are fewer. I suppose it can be used as gateway.

We own both the boardgame (now neatly piled in the "Seafarers" box) and the Travel Edition.  An excellent starter game  for those who think that the only games out there are Monopoly and Risk.  Seafarers gets most of the Catan play nowadays, with the variable board setups and victory conditions, but we still enjoy games with the Travel Edition on long car trips to visit the relatives.  A must have!

Everyone seems to rate Settlers that highly and I've introduced a few people to it. I don't often get to play it, mainly because I play a lot of 2 player games with my wife.
Although I like Settlers, I don't rate it as highly as some. Mainly because it can be a little boring if you sit in games where the dice don't go your way. Although intelligent placement of settlements is necessary, even that isn't enough to help you sometimes.

Fiatalkorom másik kedves játéka. Rengeteg partit lenyomtunk belőle. Hatszögletű területekből épül fel a térkép, amik különböző nyersanyagokat termelnek. A játékosok a hatszögek csúcsába házakat, az éleire utakat építenek. Céljuk minél több ház és hosszú útrendszer felhúzása. Ezekhez alapanyagokat a hatszögek termelnek, amiken egy-egy szám szerepel. A játékos körében dob két kockával és a dobás függvényében az adott hexa termel, a csúcsaiban levő házak tulajdonosának nyersanyagot. Szerencsefüggő, konfliktusos játék, abszolút nem az én stílusom, de akkoriban imádtuk.

THIS is beloved by millions?  

The complete and utter randomness of it all makes it all too often an exercise in frustration.  You don't roll the dice enough for bad luck to even out particularly well, and what you DO roll has a massive effect on the game.

OK, this is 'THE' classic game that exemplifies european gaming. If I am introducing some one to euro games for the first time, this is the one that I use and the game that hooks 'em all.

CONS: can get a bit repetative after several plays - buy some expansions. Players get the opportunity to amass resouces and build. This is where its capacity for further play ends. Strategies are limited.

Pros: While strategies are limited, because the game is an excellent blend of luck AND strategy, the game play is still somewhat fresh with each game. This one is a classic and it should be the law that every gamer owns a copy.

Absolutely brilliant design. Totally deserving of my high rating.

I have a facepalm moment whenever somebody calls this game "random".

Look, the split in 10 coin flips is unpredictable. Flip it 10,000 times, and it becomes extremely predictable. This game makes sure there are enough dice rolls for luck to even out. Note:
[b]Every player[/b] rolls dice on [b]every turn[/b]. The result affects [b]everybody[/b].

Very good game in which you make your own strategy and can rarely get beaten by the dice roll. It happens but an experienced player almost all the time finds a way to the victory.
Lots of replayability, competitive, a bit mean, can knock a player out from the first turns or even from the setup which can be a big downside while playing with slow friends a 2 hours game.
Low replayability for the ones who dont get this right, and high for the others :)

At one time I used to think this was one of the greatest games ever made.  Now I know better.  Still, though, it can be fantastic, but it really is prone to certain circumstances.  If the dice get screwy it can make for a long and arduous game. When playing with 4 there is enough opportunity to yield resources so that when your turn comes around you have something to do, but of course one player gets the bone usually and gets pinched out (although there are enough other things that they can still do to win if they don't get too worked early on in the game).  With 3 even more dependent on dice rolls to yield for you to be able to do anything that turn.  I would never give up my copy, as it still hits the table fairly often.

UPDATE: You know, the rating on this has gone all over the place depending on how jaded I am, but in reality, this is a damn fine game.  Really one of the best of its kind.

I am enjoying Catan, though I think that having come to it relatively late (I know it is many peoples first quote-unquote proper board game) has made me see it as relatively simple (having played things like Pandemic Legacy, and Dead of Winter etc first) - Its a game that we get out every now and then to play, and when we do, I still enjoy playing it, and hear the expansions are good, though I am yet to play any of them.

One of the most popular euros for a good reason. Everything seems to work nicely and is well balanced. The dice adds a bit of randomness to keep everyone on edge. Trading adds some interaction and collecting resources to spend adds satisfaction whilst your settlement grows. It has enough depth to keep players engaged whilst not too much that its hard to teach or off putting to beginners. A very nice social game IMO.

Some gamers complain that Catan is too reliant on luck with the dice rolls, and that's a reasonable complaint. It doesn't affect my enjoyment of the game, though.

The robber somewhat successfully keeps one player from running way ahead of everyone else, as does the trading mechanic.

At first, I was a little wary about Settlers, with its dice rolling mechanics and such.  However, after playing it, I have to say that Settlers is what gaming should be about - great social aspects with viable strategies and tactics.  Sure, the dice may be unfriendly and give you nothing for a while, but for the most part, the game rewards the players who plan best and make the best choices.  When I first got onto BGG, this game was still rated an 8, but now it's fallen quite a bit.  I understand this is not truly a gamer's game, but I think people are either rating it based on no plays, or only 1 or 2.  This game needs to be played - it's fun and quite addicting =)

I will readily admit that the theme itself helped to ruin it for me.  I don't consider medieval bartering for wheat and stone to build some roads as riveting gameplay.

RATING: 8
I have some reservations about my "8" rating, which stems, primarily (the reservations, not the rating) from my lack of personal success with the game. I just am not very good at it. But as I began to play it more and more, familiarizing myself with its particular idiosyncracies, I was able, at least to make some progress toward victory, albeit without really attaining one. I suspect, therefore, that my personal bias would lend itself to a lower rating, while my recognition of its simple mechanics, delicious decisions and the opinions of "respected" others elevates it to the "8" I gave it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game that started me down the Euro path... I like it a little less each time I play it, though. I've pretty much decided that, with a few exceptions (Twilight Struggle, Backgammon), if there's dice in the box, I'm not all that interested.

The trouble with this one is that there really is no way to mitigate the dice results. In just about any game, there will be one person (usually me, if I'm playing) who grabs up a nice couple of towns next to (say) 5's and 6's only to see 8's and 9's come up every turn. Then when the dice do finally decide to smile on the right lands, look who's here! The Robber. There's no alternate strategy, no way to work around it: I'm just screwed. After a few turns with nothing to build and nothing to trade, I start looking forward to playing a different game. 

There's a lot to love about Settlers, and I do enjoy it still. It can be exciting, and the dice cards do help to even things out some. But I'll usually reach for something else when I'm looking for a good gateway game.

TRADED AWAY, THE MAN THE MYTH MATH TRADE.

A used dutch version of Settlers from 999 games. First edition. The pieces are in near mint condition and are all there. The cards are the smaller size only found in the early editions (slightly larger then the size of a zippo lighter).

The box top is slightly dished but the bottom is fully sound. The only drawback of the game is a previous owner wrote english translation on the road building and victory point cards (6 cards overall) and on the "building" legend cards, longest road, and largest army scoring cards.

Otherwise this edition is pretty cool. I'll include copies of the english rules if desired.

This was my gateway game. There are a lot of better games out there but Settlers is brilliant for introducing new players to the hobby. Better than Ticket to Ride
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game has a good deal of intertia, in terms of developing slowly and to a good deal due to initial placement. The staged nature (initial expansion through roads and ships), however, gives way to intensive expansion (upgrading cities), and that's where the pattern of the game may change quickly. The US version seems to be designed/implemented somewhat more poorly than the original German Die Siedler: the tiles are of rather weird and poorly understandable colors. The expansion potential is nice. The give away that we allow for our 7-yr old is to let him start with more cities.

Played non-stop for almost a year.  Great fun, and a fantastic way to pull non-gamers into good games.  Occasional games do fall into non-supply-lethargy, which trading can't break out of -- less likely to happen as more experienced players learn not to cut-off resources with the bandit.  *And does cause people to say 'I have wood for sheep*

What can be said about this game that hasn't been said a million times? I enjoy playing it well enough. With the right group of people it can be a lot of fun. With the wrong group it's a miserable experience. There often isn't much to do on your turn and it can get very frustating if the dice don't go your way.

After not having played it a long time, I had to come to the hard realization that while it is a fun game initially, not being able to do anything but roll dice for one turn (often more than one) isn't that fun when you have other gaming options.

I have about 10 plays prior to 2005 when I started logging plays on BGG. No recollection of the dates of play. An okay game, in my opinion. I have friends who back in the day would always drag this out. It was interesting at first, but started to dread it after the fifth or so play. I'm not sure what all the hype is around it... I think there are much better games of this kind around, but I do appreciate its place in gaming history, and how it opened up Euro-style games to the masses.

I don't think I will ever get tired of playing this game. I think a large part of what makes this game fun is how often you use puns in your trading and offers. "Can I get wood or ore" response should always be "ore what?!?!". But ultimately this game will always keep changing each time you play, and leave you wanting to kick your friends butt the next time you play.

Although the expansion sets are of flimsy quality, the game is a solid design.  Based on craps, it couldnt go wrong.  Settlers is a lot of fun to play, Ive never been interested much in who wins.  It is a lot of fun to add additional pieces.  I have brought in my own soldiers, tanks, and terrain pieces.  I dont like playing this one with people who play to win.  There is a bit too much luck involved and I get tired of hearing people complain.

It is so easy to get screwed from turn one and basically have no realistic chance of winning from then on.

I will never understand the world's obsession with "Catan."

I played it for the first time in highschool and it almost ruined my love for board games because this was the only thing anyone wanted to play.

Roll some dice, see what you get. Hope it isn't a 7.

Sure, sure, you CAN trade resources, but nobody is ever going to unless they get a far better deal in return.

"Catan" is the new "Monopoly."

Ten years after it's release, I've finally played this classic. I got totally screwed on the die rolls (10 times as many 8's as 6's somehow) in my first game, but it was still fun. It's way too reliant on luck as the central mechanism when compared to other Euros.

It's quite interesting that I haven't gotten around to playing this game until ten years after its original release. Without a doubt, it hasn't lost its charm since then. Our game group plays it more or less regularly, and it never seems to grow old. It truly shows what a great design Settlers really was and is.

I'm not to big on the other Catan games, but the original will last in my board game library for a long time to come.

This may actually be a 6.5 for me, but it is difficult to distill my feelings on the actuall game play and design from the warm feelings it gives me as my first eurogame. It really is an excellent game in many ways, but two unfortunate parts plague it. For one, the luck factor screws it up for me. You roll two dice each turn, and these rolls give you your resources, which ultimately determine your success in the game. Of course, you place yourself on the map to best take advantage of the probabilities, but anyone who plays this game will tell you, dice sometimes have a mind of their own, and will often disregregard the probabilities. The other part that bothers me is how completely malicious the robber mechanic is - amazingly brutal for a gateway type game. 

Having said all that, I'll also say that the Traders and Barbarians expansion neatly wipes out both of these issues for me, so get the expansion if my issues with the game seem sound to you.

I was quite late to the Settlers party, and it's hard for me to have much historical appreciation for the old warhorse.  I get that it opened a lot of eyes to the Euro possibilities here in the States, but I just wasn't blown away.  I got my Gateway on playing Carcassone H&G and Ticket to Ride Europe, and that was enough to send me on my way.  By the time I got to Settlers, I was all, "Oh.  That was...nice."

The best part of this game is that it can be very social and very tense.  The worst part is when it's neither social nor tense.  The VERY WORST THING about Settlers is that you can go several rounds (or half the game) without doing anything on your turn.  Roll the dice, pass the dice.  Yuck.  Basically, I think that the set collection and building mechanics were improved upon quite a bit with the Ticket to Ride franchise.  

I'll play this when my just-getting-into-gaming friends suggest it, but I'll never offer to play it again.

RATING: 7.5
The great classic. Probably the first game people think of nowadays after relics like Monopoly, Classic Risk and Cluedo.

+ It is satisfying to slowly expand your civilisation and see your settlers thrive.
+ Easy too learn, hard to master. 
+ The gathering of resources and using them in specific combinations to build seems mundane now, but every other game that does this partly builds on the legacy of SoC.

+/- a few of the problems with the game can be fixed with expansions. (Seafarers makes wool worth more, Fishermen makes coastal settlements less of a waste)

- The runtime can be too long if people take too long negotiating.
- It is a tad too luckheavy for my tastes. If the dice are not on your side you won't have anything to do in your turn. 

It's still part of my 'introduction trinity' with Pandemic and Ticket to Ride

I understand this game's significance to boardgaming.  Even in my own life, I had many plays of it with my wife's fellow grad students while living in Boston.  Alas, it's just not something I want to play that much.  The trading and negotiation aspect is nice, but it drags things out too much, and it's all that time that really lowers it rating.  It's also fundamentally a race game, which doesn't help that much, especially because it suffers from an endgame bash-the-leader mechanism.

I enjoy this game but I overdosed (I played probably 300 times) and am uninterested in playing again. The mechanics are fun but once everyone is experienced it feels very predetermined. We have more fun just making a new board and placing the beginning pieces than actually playing out the game.

One of my most favorite games. Overall set up strategy in the begining, and you can then pay as much or as little attention as you want to the game. Just buy what you have cards for, or strategically save up for items. Never feel lost or confused about what's happening in the game, or your progression compared to others. Little to no direct confrontation with other players either (i.e. little to no arguing)

This is the most influential game for me in my collection, because it was my gateway game to the world of board games. 

I have great memories but in the end I have outgrown it because there are so many better games. This game has been around so long that I don't need to talk about it's strengths rather I'll point out the two things I don't like. 

The biggest problem I have with this game now is too often people are left playing catch up all game. This is due to the driving mechanism of dice giving resources. Also near the end everyone seems to go into an isolationist mode because they are now able to bank roll themselves through various means.  

This game though is the catalyst for all the games I love, I feel it was the key to the evolution for strategy board games.

Catan would be a great game if not for the games when the dice just hate you. The snowball effect means that a few unlucky rolls in the beginning can cut you out of contention. That, and players unwilling to trade can muck it up for everyone. For that reason, I prefer Seafarers: it makes sheep more valuable and opens up more strategies. I also think that the original game is a bit too crowded with four, but not quite interactive enough with three. While decisions are less frequently as interesting as I would like, Catan is a classic. At a table with casual gamers, I'm usually up for a game. In any other context, I'd opt for something else.

An old favorite, and a classic! Lots of randomness with the initial setup and, of course, all the dice. But the forward/reverse starting setup rule, and the wheeling and dealing of the trades more than make up for it. I still think it's a great game, but I just don't play it very often any more -- hence the slight drop in rating.

I wouldn't introduce euros to a total newbie with Settlers, without a lot of hand-holding: they'd get slaughtered if they didn't understand the importance of the starting set up, and trades later on as people get within striking range of the magic 10. But it's a classic for a reason! These days, though, I prefer it's descendants (e.g., Cities and Knights, America, etc.).

takes so long to set up, and then you can get in a bad spot ... but still I like it. There is enough luck that I don't feel too bad when I loose, but I get to do lots of planing, and that planing often plays off. (Seafarers expansion is an improvement.)

One of the first games I ever played. I don't dislike the game, I just dislike the randomness it has. I know there are strategies, taking the key resources with the most common numbers so that you have the highest chance to do something or trade effectively... but... it's still very much luck dependent. And I don't like being screwed so much by bad dice rolls, when you can spend few turns just doing nothing, because you have no resources due to bad dice rolls and have nothing to trade to get the needed resources. I won a few times too, don't get me wrong, there is strategy involved, I have no doubt about it. I just rather play games I can influence more than this one.

Yeah, so it's got dice and chance.  Deal with it!  I like a variety of games and this one scratches a particular itch.  There IS strategy to this game beyond the initial placement, but sometimes your numbers just don't come up.  That's life....

Settlers is the game that got me back into boardgames after many years away.  Thank you, Klaus!  Even after a few years of playing it ad nauseum, Die Siedler still holds up.  One of the very best, and will go down as one of the all time classics.  Can millions of people really be wrong?  In this case, an emphatic NO!  (Admittedly, I'd rather play Cities & Knights than basic Catan at this point... but that surely isn't a knock against this fantastic game.  Indeed, I rate Settlers higher by .5 simply because it's far easier to get to the table and play in a reasonable time.  The wrong group kills C&K.)

This game is simple and easy to teach but still brings with it a lot of strategy.  I used to REALLY love this game but no more.  I don't typically have a problem with randomness and dice rolls in my designer games, in fact a healthy dose of chaos usually increases my love for a game but this game is 90% dice rolls and it has worn on me how many turns can go by in some games with nothing to do.  This is especially true in a 2-player game where there is virtually no inter-player trading.

Had very mixed experiences with this, and it's not really lived up to the hype... (perhaps for me Carcassonne did the gateway thing?) - sometimes it just seems to take forever and be just boring, for some reason... other times, pretty quick and fun, even with more players. Like it in the main, but I just wish it was a bit more consistent for me - or I was a bit more consistent for it, perhaps...?

EDIT: Bumped up a bit since the 6 rating of Jan 2010, as it deserves more than that, not least for the game with the kids where we got real fruit for successful trading, but it's still not the best game, I think, and is a bit slow to get going perhaps? Takes too long to do much.

The appeal is obvious: you can start playing the game within a few minutes and the luck factor allows you to just roll with the punches if you like, while there's enough strategy to give yourself a lot to think about if you'd rather go in that direction. Unfortunately things can get repetitive very quickly; the trading element which appeals to so many makes me personally want to tear my hair out as I hear "I have X; does anyone want it for Y?" over and over and over again, with later trading rounds becoming ever more ridiculous as players (usually newer ones) close in on victory and slow the game down with desperate offers and hopeless propositions. And then the robber comes along to lengthen the proceedings even further. I'd probably enjoy this somewhat with seasoned gamers who know to only trade in certain situations.

Settlers used to be THE game I wanted to play. I found it endlessly fascinating and challenging. I loved how the board was different for every game. But somehow, time has taken the shine off this game for me. I've begun to find that there are games where, when if I'm losing, I spend the entire game losing without any hope of recovery. The dice just don't go my way, a resource is scarce because of the board layout and my settlement placement order, etc. Settlers really offers a limited way to win, and if you can't get there, you WON'T be able to get there, and it's frustrating. I've seen many games of Settlers completely stall. It's a good game, and maybe I've just had some bad games recently, but on the whole, I prefer Cities & Knights.

Copycat purchase.  played many times prior to joining BGG.  of course, this was the game that got us into boardgaming, just like so many others.  PROS:  variable board set up, initial placement of settlements is the highlight for me, collection of resources for road/settlement/city building/development cards, relatively short playing time.  CONS:  dice(when rolled unfavorably, there is NOTHING you can do to gather more resources), in our group the negotiation/trading does NOT work, therefore we tend to have more downtime than other groups.  OVERALL:  after our honeymoon period, the dice were the killer of our love for catan.  the excitement of the initial placement of settlements could not overcome the droughts of bad rolls or the constant 7's that plague us.  i will always remember catan fondly for introducing us to the boardgame hobby, i may play with a newbie at their insistence but i will probably never ask to play it again.  
4/18/17:  gave it to another family that will give it some love.  thank you catan for lighting the boardgaming bug in us.

This was my gateway game as an adult back into the boardgaming world.

People complain of randomness but I don't mind it at all.  To me it's part of the game. Like in Monopoly if you don't get your rolls you're not going to get Park Place and Boardwalk.

However, there is so much more here in terms of strategy and different paths to victory.

It's a great gateway game and a very fun game which is the most important point above all other criteria when evaluating a game for yourself, whether you're into strictly highly strategic games with no luck or a newbie who loves high change light games.

For me, this is a great family fun game in the Medium to Light category, played in about an hour and we always have fun playing it. There's a bit of player interaction with the robber (you can choose to gang up on the leading player to an extent), and trading cards with others, creating longest road or largest army and stealing the points from the current leader, or blocking opponents paths with your roads.

Haven't had a chance to add the expansions which I think would allow one to tailor the game and make it even better for them and longer.

As you can tell from the way it exploded in North America as a gateway game it appeals to a higher percentage of the population and non-gaming people than most other games. Some people just don't want or can't handle too complicated and strategic a game.  They want it medium/light for a reason - to relax and have fun and Catan hits the spot extremely well!

I'll always remember it as the game that got me back in...and Love It!

A very, very fun game.  I have both the travel and regular edition.  The regular game is so much fun, always random and new, and, no matter how likely your starting spots should gather resources, they don't have to.  We played a long game of 4 people in which a 6 was only rolled twice.  Twelve popped up 6 times, 2 at least 3.  Cest la vie!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dull.  I have played too many games where one person ends up with a hand full of nothing or resources nobody wants and then proceeds to sit there miserably for the majority of the game.  Often, I have been that person.  Even though I know how to play the odds, it sometimes happens that an 8 never rolls in a game while an 11 will roll 5 times in a row.  You can't control that and half the time you can't even mitigate it.

I don't really think Settlers is necessarily a bad game, but the dice mechanic makes it so.  I have always contended that trying a new mechanic, such as card drafting or something else would make the game quite fun.  Hell, I rather enjoy Settlers of America: Trails to Rails in spite of the dice rolling because the gold coin mechanic and the sheer number of ways you can DO things with your resources really helps to avoid the rut that Settlers can induce.

EDIT: my opinion of Settlers has improved. I now consistently do well and can appreciate the game despite the age of the design. I've still played it too much to enjoy it more than a 7, though.

Dice rolling at it's finest. This is a nice game, everyone gets it, and almost everyone enjoys it.

The trading makes the game have higher replayability.

Lots of plays. 40-50 perhaps?

This is the game that got me really into Eurogames back in '96. I had a (very) small selection of Euros at that time, but was mostly playing Magic and Warhammer FRP. Settlers and the Settlers card game were the games that changed it all. But even if another game had been my introduction, I still would appreciate Settlers for what it is: an instant timeless classic, that got a whole generation back to the playing table. I don't play it as regurarly anymore (certainly not the base game only), but it's always a blast when I do. I'm really looking forward to play this with my girls one day.

This game is ancient but we play it on the local game night when everyone has had a hard week and just wants a relaxing game. The game is easy to play so conversation flows as you play it. It is just a feel good game. 

If you are playing a game like Caverna - a popular favourite at the game group - then everyone is thinking and the conversation pretty much goes out the window until the end.

As a family game Settlers (sorry, "Catan") is fantastic. I am a bit disappointed I had to splash out so much to get 5 player extension. This is why I have held off getting seafarers expansion because it is expensive with the 5 player extension.

This game is the ultimate "gateway drug".  If I'm thinking about getting someone into gaming, I always show them Settlers, and they ALWAYS love it!
Some friends complain that it's too random, but I still get a good strategic feel out of it.  You do need the dice to work in your favor though.  I'm a big craps fan, so the dice give me a cheap thrill.

RATING: 7
One of the first "New" generation of board games that I played, Catan will always have a special place on my shelf.  That being said, it is more reliant on luck than a lot of the other games I play, and as a result, it will not be at the top of my list.  My strategy is to go broad on dice results so that there is rarely a roll that doesn't benefit, but sometimes, that is not a winning combination.  It seems that there is always one number that comes up more than its distribution warrants, and no way to strategize for that.

Of course like most, this was my "gateway game."  I picked it up in shrink at a local thrift shop for two bucks...six years later I have a lot less money because of it.  I still think this is a great game when played with the right people.  However, there is one person with whom I will not play this because of his "extortion variant."

Extortion is not negotiation.

I can not count how many times I have played this game at this point. Well over a hundred I'm sure counting the times I've played with the seafarers and cities and knights expansions. Not to mention star trek catan as well.
Some people grow tired of this game after a while and others like myself just don't. Either way, most people will end up playing this game many times because it holds a very high replay value.
It's strategic enough to offer a challenge for more seasoned gamers but easy enough to teach the base game in just a few minutes.
The expansions also hold great additional content if you find yourself looking for more variation. And the cities and knights expansion makes the game far more intricate.
This will always be a game that I have in my collection.

RATING: 5
Here we have the "Monopoly" of the Modern Age of board games - roll the dice, possibly collect some resources, negotiate with the other players, perhaps build a house or two, and move along to the next player.  I hesitate to speak negatively about a game that is of such importance to the world of board games, and that is indeed my wife's personal favourite board game.  After all, it's probably not an exaggeration to state that Settlers was largely responsible for the rapid rise in popularity of German games, as well as for introducing, or at least re-introducing, many of us to the hobby of gaming.  But that being said, I was never very impressed with the game.  Sure, it has some fun elements of gathering resources and spending them to expand your settlements, but the fact that you are so much at the mercy of rolls of the dice really takes away the fun of it (unless you have the "Event Card" expansion).  Add to that the fact that a player can get blocked in right from the beginning of the game (I've played a few games where I sat and did very little all game, watching helplessly as other players expanded across the board), and you can end up with a pretty frustrating playing experience.  (For proof that it is not the fact that I often do poorly at this game that influences my decision to give it a poor rating, see my reviews of "Cleopatra and the Society of Architects", and "Fury of Dracula".)  When played with the "Seafarers" and "Cities and Knights" expansions my rating goes up to a 6/10, even though the already tedious set-up and play time becomes painfully long.  However, you can save yourself the trouble and expense of purchasing all the expansions and just get "The Settlers of the Stone Age", which in my mind is a much more fun stand-alone version.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5/10

The reason I want to explore board games more. Leaves space for table talk and fun trade banter, while giving you a solid game to play and think about.

The classic Euro Gateway game.  If you are one of the 5 people on the planet who hasn't played this game you really should.  It has all the features I really like in a game: a modular board, meaningful player interaction, resource management, a decent play time (about 1 hour) and moderately challenging tactical choices.  The down side is that luck can figure somewhat prominently in the game and players can make very foolish trading decisions with other players that ends up hurting you; however, that just means you have to do some table talking and stronger negotiating.  This adds in some interesting player interaction that often gets overlooked by people who don't like this game.  It's not a perfect game of course, but I think it is a good classic game that is still the gateway of choice for many.

settlers is both brilliantly designed and potentially very frustrating, as failure to produce resources basically shuts you out of the game.  i use the event cards to minimize this problem.  i also tend to prefer playing with the fishermen expansion, which makes the coasts more valuable and increases your ability to do a range of things.

settlers is deservedly a classic game and i imagine i'll be playing it as long as i'm around.

The rating was initially 7. Playing the game a few more times over the last year, I realized just how flawed it is. Too much randomness and a huge emphasis on a good start without any comeback mechanism means that a player can lose after ten minutes... but still has to sit through the whole hour that the game takes.

This game is quite interesting. I'd probably pick up the seafarers expansion, but those no-goodies that publish it decided to parse out the 5-6 player expansions for each expansion, so, they get not a dime more from me unless they decide to skip the cash grab and just let me buy the once.

RATING: 7.5
[Mayfair third edition w/ pre-2007 adapter kit] {Catan, Civilization, gateway; trading, modular-board, development, dice-rolling, resource management; optimal 3p} Settlers of Catan is a decent family game with a strong development theme. It is fun and exciting. The game flow is very smooth and has less down time. It's not a heavy strategy game but it provides many tactical options. It is of good player interaction from the trading, robber and the competition of roads. The dice rolling, though luck-driven, adds excitement to the game.

It has several novel mechanics - dynamic board, rolls for production, etc, which have been re-used in many other games.

Beginners' setup should be used when introducing this game to your friends. No matter how you remind them, they will easily overlook the importance of initial placement of settlements and priority of resources at different stages of the game. They will then feel desperate that they are blocked from the game.

I know this is the classic gateway game, and I like some of the mechanics, but I just find the base Catan a bit bland for my taste.  You should try it at least once, since it's a classic and has some neat mechanics, but I much prefer Struggle for Rome, which uses the same mechanics in a more streamlined and directed way.  If you're going to play regular Catan, at least add Cities & Knights, which adds some more good decisions and available routes to resources (e.g. bonus cards).

This is a great game for all those people out there who think Risk and Monopoly are good games. It will show them the error of their ways and open their eyes to the beauty of the non-department store games. Settlers is colorful, easy to learn, and most importantly; random. The pieces are layed down in random fashion, then the number tiles and ports are randomly applied. Players then choose their starting positions and begin rolling the dice. The game has some minor balance issues, but the only great fault I have found, is that if a player has a run of bad luck early in the game it can leave them hopelessly behind, and trod upon by their fellow gamers. Less mature gamers often want to give up part way through when it is clear they are not going to win. The Seafarers expansion was weak, but the Cities and Knights expansion, while a bit complex, is a nice addition once the original has lost some luster. Not my favorite game, but it will have a place near the top of my game stack for many years to come.

Da oltre 15 anni milioni di persone in tutto il mondo competono commerciando e costruendo nel classico gioco creato da Klaus Teuber. E il numero dei fan è sempre in aumento!

CATAN ...

... è il nome che tu e i tuoi compagni avete dato all’isola che avete scoperto. Voi siete i suoi primi abitanti.

Costruite insediamenti, poi strade. Scambiando materie prime, i villaggi diventano presto città.

Talvolta c’è argilla in abbondanza, altre volte minerali. Il baratto apre nuove possibilità per te,

ma anche per i tuoi avversari.

Ma lo spazio già scarseggia sull’isola – e una lotta per la supremazia, la terra e le risorse comincia.

Alla fine è presto chiaro – ci può essere solo un Signore di CATAN. Vuoi essere tu il colono più influente?

Preparati alla sfida!

O jogo deve ser respeitado como o clássico que é, para o seu tempo foi absolutamente essencial, necessário e até revolucionário. É divertido mas já nao empolga tanto diante das opçoes que temos hoje (mas que em parte só se tornaram possíveis graças ao Catan).

Wow. This weekend I played this for the first time in a long time (the first time since really getting into boardgaming), and it was not a pleasant experience. The only important and interesting decision is the initial placement of settlements. After that its a negotiation game, which is fine, its just way too long for what it is, especially when one or more resources are absent from the game because of the die rolls.

Also in the same box: 5-6 player expansion

The expansion works just fine as an expansion, but the game can get long with more than 4 players. If you are a Catan fan it shouldn't matter, but if you are trying to introduce the game to a group, it can get very long with 5-6 players.

RATING: 6
Originally loved this game no denying it.. but its staying power over time was trumped by what seems to have become an ongoing frustration of dice rolling. Concept is still great and I'm happy to have the game in my collection. Simply over the years I've found other games (or expansions) that of more interest. Also I've had too many games where the numbers you think should come up do and can result in a slow and tedious time.

If Casablanca was released today, would it be considered a good movie?

Settlers gets the Hall of Fame waiver.  Any game that is as well-loved as this and as prominent in gaming history as this (which I don't actually dislike) gets a "6" or better.

Having said THAT, there are lots of games I'd rather play than this.  If I only had 45 minutes before I had to leave a get-together and someone pulled out this game, it'd be 50/50 whether I'd play it or leave.

Catan was my introduction to Euro games (I'm such a cliche) and I played ten billion games of it before I learned there was a whole genre of other games like it. I think that Catan has been eclipsed by lots of other games for me, but it'll always have a place in my heart.

Must have played this a hundred times (but only occasionally since I started recording plays).  I still like the occasional game but there are now better games that often play in a shorter time or deeper games that play in a similar length of time.

RATING: 2
This is a game that too often then not revolves around the dice/luck element and not enough about tactics. Every game I've played of this has involved someone losing badly through no fault of their own (8's being rolled when they needed 6's)

Played again and once again someone had a load of early luck and easily won the game with it's snowball affect. 3's and 11's being rolled more than 8's. Also only about three times was a 4 rolled in the entire game.

Latest play confirms all that I've said above and more, this time I had 10's and they only appeared 3 times in the entire game, the 4's must have been closer to 20 times. Needless to say the player who only gained resources on a 3,4,5 or 11 original and never throughout the game gained off a 6 or 8 won easily 12pts to 4pts to 4pts. His win was of course purely down to the phenomenal dice rolls.

A total luck fest, a game seriously flawed that allows players to sit there doing nothing for 15 minutes at a time through no fault of their own

A venerable classic to some people, to me it’s a relatively recently discovered game that led to many other new games.

Simple, involving, different each play. A game where luck is a virtue, forcing trading, attention to hand-limits and use (& defence against) the blocking robber.

A gateway game that’s a wonderful destination in its own right.

While the basic game is a 10, almost every expansion adds complexity or downtime, and reduces the rating.

Just about the perfect gateway game. The rules are easy to explain and pick up and the dice mechanic and trading is a great equaliser for newbie players against experienced. After many plays I am no closer to hitting on a perfect, winning strategy because the mix of resources is different every time and the interaction of the various mechanics means there are very few "cut and dried" decisions. It's also a very sociable game with lots of talking and little downtime or brain burning. A classic.

OK game. If I'm looking for a trading game I'd prefer to play Chinatown, but this game does have some interesting elements.

Must play with the "Harbor Master" (A settlement on a harbour is worth 1 "harbour point". A city on a harbour is worth 2 "harbour points". The first player to reach 3 harbour points gets the "Harbour Master" card and the 2 VP that go with it. A player who achieves more harbour points than the current Harbour Master takes the card and becomes the new Harbour Master.) and play to 11 VP to balance the game out.

RATING: 7.5
I used to really like this game, and have played it dozens and dozens and dozens of times. Usually it is a lot of fun, and can be pretty exciting with the right people. However, it can also get really frustrating, and I have seen some people get pretty mad when their road gets cut off (or something equally trivial). 

I think my rating has also been skewed some by the "this is a 'really light, introductory game' to the game boarding world, and thus it doesn't deserve a high rating" mentality.

In any case, I have only played it once in the last two years. Whether it is because of how I personally feel, or how those who play with me feel, this does need to be reflected in the rating I give.

have plyed this a few times now with my kids. They are a bit too young for it and loose interest if its not their go. However I was beaten by one of them on the second play and I was trying to win! Its a fantastically balanced game; i like the way it changes, the choice of startegies you can employ- well everything everyone else likes I guess. I can see this becoming popular in our house.

One of my favorite board games of all time. I love the strategy involved in it (which resources are most valuable, who to trade with, whether or not to risk holding more resources, when to use development cards, etc.), and if you play with experienced players the games go by pretty quickly. My only gripe is playing with people that take forever with their turns, which can really detract from how engaging the game can be.

After Monopoly and Risk, Catan is possibly the most well known board game. The gateway game for many of today's boardgamers, Catan is iconic. And while Catan is an excellent gateway game, it's just that, a gateway game. Most board game players will eventually grow tired of Catan and move on to more complex and newer games. But Catan retains a spot on their game shelf, fondly reminding the owner of past games with friends. We feel indebted somehow to the game, a first love with a special place in our hearts. And when it's time to introduce someone new to board games beyond Monopoly and Risk, Catan waits on the shelf - smooth, simple, easy to teach - ready to welcome a new gamer to the hobby.

Simple to learn fun game with a simple game mechanic.  The strategy relies on playing the odds and bargaining, while not giving away the farm, so to speak.

For my 13th birthday 1995 I got to buy two games. One was a version of Risk with nice plastic miniatures, the other was the first edition of Catan. I dont know where Risk is lying around right now (it's not that bad of a game though), but Catan has always stayed with me.

It's a great combination of theme and mechanics, everything works neatly together. Best family game of all times, for sure.

Dont like the new plastic pieces though. I'm glad I got the wooden ones!

We normally play with Cities and Knights and Seafarers.  We build the normal central island, surrounded by a ring of water, surround by 4 sets of 3 hex islands face down.  The outer islands are 2 of each resource and 2 gold mines and are revealed when a ship is placed next to the one.  The 'Intrigue' card may be used to move the pirate.  You need 15 points to win.

I don't like this game, which has grown into a true classic.

I think the strategy involved mostly dries out after the first colonies have been placed, afterwards, the game becomes boring and too luck-dependant.

Settlers has done a lot to draw more people to board games, and for that I am grateful.

A classic and a very simple gateway game.  I never get the chance to play this as much as I would like.  My biggest complaint is that it needs more people than 2 to be fun.  This is my "monopoly" for muggles and provides wonderful interaction among a group, but it can get very long when teaching new players and playing with 6 people.

EDIT:  I came back to this one after playing many better Eurogames.  It is now boring and I do not like it much.  The beginning is fun, but it drags on for too long.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Light resource/civilisation game let down by a few too many flaws. Players place settlements adjoining different types of resource, which contain numbers. If the number is rolled, the players gain resources, which in turn allows them to develop their civilisation (upgrade settlements to cities, build roads, acquire development cards etc), which will often gain them victory points, the first to 10 winning the game. The game is simple and seems to strike a chord with players new to gaming but beyond that there are too many flaws that will keep seasoned players away. The main problem arises from there being far too much luck involved with the rolling of dice for resource production, an element you have absolutely no control over and which drives the game. It can become quite galling to place a settlement next to a hex containing a number with a high probability of being rolled only for it never to appear (or only when the robber has been placed on it). For me, this game can become far too frustrating on too many occasions to be enjoyable.

RATING: 7
This game is the epitome of streamlining and elegance.

The rules are so simple and so clearly comprised on a few cards, yet you can do vastly different things, you win on only 10 victory points, get some "haha" moments against your opponents that feel like your master strategy being executed but still maintain a non-gamer friendly level of luck and have no real downtime on your opponents turns as you also get resources and look what they do.

Compared to e.g. Stone Age, this truly is a non-gamers game.

So, why no perfect 10 rating? 
After years I just grew a bit out of the simple base mechanics, the luck factor is too large for my taste and the game does not bring forth that much exitement for me anymore. Still gladly playing it though.

RATING: 8
Pros:  
+ Good and simple game to play
+ Good for board game beginners
+ Decent mechanics ( Ex. Robbers to keep hoarders/monopoly of a single resource in check)
+ Good for competitive people
+ Quality components and have some waterproof ability (spilled beer on it and cardboard only got a little wet on sides)
+ Decent Strategy as there are many ways to win
+ Fun to play with many people
+ Playing time is moderate, not too long and not too short.

Cons:
- Luck of the dice roll
- Only max four players.  need to get expansions for 5-6 players
- Might get hurt in competitive game (slap on wrist when opponents know you are monopolizing a resource) :/
- Maybe too much downtime:  Ex. Wish there is a timer on your actions when a player has 32 card resources on their hand and trying to figure out how to use them best
- Could cost a bit w/ 5-6 (maybe around 40-50 bucks).  Better strategy games out there for that kind of cost.
- Wouldn't be great to play multiple times in the same day.
- Many expansions.  Could cost a lot more for certain people.

This is the reason I got into board games. It's a fantastic gateway game that is easy to teach and fun to play. Great player interaction, and very fluid gameplay. This game is always a fun time, and it's my go to for introducing new people to board games.

Only reason this isn't rated higher is that I've played it too many times now. fantastic game and always a good time.

RATING: 7
This was a good one.  I must admit, it was a little disappointing to play though.  I think the disappointment came because of all the hype about this game and how great it was.  I thought it would be much better than it was. It just felt like it was missing something but maybe it was the fact that I didn't see what all the hype was about. With that being said, I still felt like it was an enjoyable game.  If the hype factor wasn't included, I may have enjoyed it more.  There were lots of decisions to make and several ways to win.  Everybody was in the game to the end.  The game is worth a decent rating because it is a good game.  It is not worth the "Cult-like" reaction that I see so much on the site and elsewhere.  Not the best Eurosnoot out there and really doesn't see the table of my gaming group more than once every few months.

"blessed are the flexible, for they will not be broken"
i really like tactical games that force you to modify your strategy during the game. this game is good for those who can best capitalize on whatever cards they have, good or bad. some say this is one of those "gamers games" but i can get almost anyone to play. once they play, they like it. slight element of luck allows even weak players to win one every so often. i usually play with 4 people total. once i played with 2, didn't like it. it will be a long time till i'm sick of this one. also get the computer version at www.the-underdogs.org

This is a fantastic game, and my rating is low because I've just simply played it too many times (500+).  At this point it doesn't have the thrill it once did.  I'm usually willing to play, but I won't suggest it very often.

The card trading and amount of interaction in this game are what makes it so much fun.

There is 'something' about this game the makes you coming back to play it with friends even after 50  games. For probability freak like me it is a great title. I love to play it even without any expansions. It is great title for introduction to new players ( not the best but it works quiet well with some ) but it is also fun to play with semi-expirienced players. I recomand buying this game if it is one of your first titles to buy.

Great gateway game, too much luck involved for my taste but I did play it lots of times. I find it much nicer with the Seafarers expansion. The 5-6 player expansions are not so good as there is a lot of down time.

So done with this game, see comments for star trek catan. there are some great things this game did, but a number of bad design choices ruin this. Really if the game took about 30-45 min. it would be really good, I cant devote 2 hrs plus to this. Last game took 2.5 hrs; 2.9.17 (andrews place)

Let me also add to the star trek comments: the Longest Road and most military are stoopid, and obviously tacked on mechanics that dont add anything to the theme. Drawing cards hoping for an army is about as unimaginative and as far from developing an army as anything. And when was building a long road a strategy? OK maybe the Burma road, but modern thinking even questions that strategy. So dumb.

The tedious trading mechanic is one of several irksome features. It's actually a very good mechanic of generating production with a randon iterative proces (rolling dice), so it's worth checking out. But it takes too long for what it is and that is perhaps the only reason I rate it this low, if this could play in 45 minutes, it would probably be at least a 6 or 7.  Too many scoring systems detract from any pretence of "classic" feel. Monopoly with proper house rules, that rein in the time, is better. ALso dont like the placement strategy of roads and cities as this seems too simplistic. The new version of settling america looks more sophisticated and better.

This is my ultimate gateway game. The moment the board's set up it catches the eyes of passersby.

This game is a trusted friend. Highly recommended.

One of the few games I will give a ten. You can play this game a LONG time before you figure out the best strategy in each situation. Read my article "Number never rolled? Got blocked?

The game that introduced me to a new world of board games.  I could not stop until I had all the Mayfair expansions, which all add to the game.  I will always want to play this, although now that I have played this so much (before logging games began) and have newer games, the rating has dropped from the original 10, but only because we don't play it so often anymore.  It is still a fantastic game.

I enjoyed this game on the few times I played it with gamers and non gamers alike. So far, I havent encountered any of the problems talked about here on BGG of being locked out of the game early on.

A high longevity game by two factors: the modular hex map and the system dice sufficiently balanced.

I'm still trying to come to grips with the randomness in this game.  While I've only played a handful of games, after each game there's been almost zero  understanding among the players as to why one person won the game and others didn't fare as well - other than something like "those 5's were coming up a LOT!", or "you were getting robbed all game" (admittedly avoidable).  I'll keep trying.

It is worth mentioning that is great for people of varying gaming skills given the fact luck has a big part to play and people generally use the robber on the most experienced gamer which helps to evens things out.

I wanted to rate this a 7, but have decided it is a classic that deserves a little more.  Settlers is one of the first games that introduced me to euro style games.  It's a great intro game and while there's so much more out there, it's hard not to enjoy a game of Settlers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My wife and I used to love this game, but the enjoyment tapered off fast. First, it was the sense of futility that we got when we realized that our initial settlement placements had been sub-par; we'd spend the rest of the game as non-contenders, having no fun. Then it was the addition of Cities & Knights, which did nothing to mitigate the value of initial city placement, ramped up the 'take that' factor with barbarian attacks and knight fights, and lengthened the whole, lousy experience by at least an hour.

I've played once with Seafarers since then, and found that, due to the increased value that having a settlement on the shore gives you, it felt a little less predetermined. More plays are needed to decide if I need to move Settlers' rating back up or not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun little game.  Getting the right combination of resources for trading and building is the key.  Unfortunately, there's just enough luck with getting your numbers to come up, and not rolling 7s when your hand is large, to be problematic.  Inevitably someone gets the short end of the stick, and just can't seem to get resources, or gets his resources robbed.  Even just drawing a victory point card instead of "another militia" can make the difference.  It's a design decision for sure, but it's a tad more variance than I like.
Nonetheless, playing it occasionally, and still enjoying this one.

Catan is the gateway game that it's touted to be because it cohesively has a little of everything: dice rolling as the bridge from the classic family games of old, Euro-style resources, route building, hand management, a modular board consisting of hex tiles, and even a social aspect via trading. And light enough to teach in just a few minutes and play in about an hour. I've never had a game of Catan last two hours, and most games with veterans finish in under one.

It's a real gateway for non-gamers. The rules are simple enough and I like its negotioation mechanism. I tried it with my relatives and with friends and it was always fun. Even my mother in low, who had hated boardgames before, tried it and was delighted.

The Euro-game that started it all for me.  As much as I am tired of Catan after years of endless playing, this is still a fan favorite.  All of my friends, even those that think board games are lame, LOVE this game.  We had more success getting people to play this game repeatedly than anything else I have seen.  There is plenty to do and though the game is pretty straight forward, the difference in peoples desire to trade and ever changing game board, this game has a lot of replayability.  Most on here recommend against 6 players, but I think the expansion is great.  It is always nice to have more seats open at the table...

I really do not get why so many people love this game. I feel it's like the Monopoly of Euro games: everyone keeps talking so much about it that new players don't know there are better options. Your game path is fairly scripted from your starting location and you are at the mercy of the dice and other players willingness to trade at any given time. I prefer to have choices that matter.

RATING: 5
This is hailed as the new Monopoly, not because of its gameplay, but because of its incredible mass adoption by big retail chain stores.  It is the poster child for bringing a new generation into the world of board games.  It in large part represents a renaissance of the market, and for that reason this game has transcended the significance of its own gameplay.  

If you play the game with all of that cultural importance aside, I think that is best.  You play the role of a settler, building settlements, cities, and roads across the landscape. The twist and main meat of the game is that you can strike deals with other players to get vital resources for your colonies to expand.  Since I have played the heck out of this game, I'm not too keen on playing it anymore.  I think the game is excellent, but at this point I think it has largely been outclassed by newer and more interesting games.  There's too much out there to choose from for this to be THE game you play first as an introduction to the world of board games.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This was the gateway into "hobbyist" games for me and many others. While the element of random chance can prove frustrating at times, it does keep things interesting, and trading, the heart and soul of the game, is fast-paced and often hilarious.

A true classic. I find it the best game to introduce to newbies. It's interactive, it's a rather luck-driven (which is a good and bad thing), and it has excellent yet simple concepts. Even playing the 2-player variant is fun.

2017-12-25: It's been almost 10 years since I reviewed this game. In all honesty, I haven't been this game in years. But it still holds a special place in my heart, and I have not found a game with so much tension and cut-throat negotiations, even though it is very random.

I'm still downgrading this from a 10->8 though, simply because it's not something I'd play given the choice.

Xmas 2006. Need to play without 85 yr old Grandad!! It was a struggle and took us forever to play the very first game with the rule suggested tile setup. I don't enjoy having my cards taken away/stolen from me so it may not be a keeper from my point of view, I felt very picked on and nearly sulked hahaha. Nearly 8 year old son liked to collect soldiers to have the largest army so that was his tactics. I did win the game tho so that will ensure another game or two :b

Second game and I like it a lot more, DS ( now aged 8 ) won. His tactic of buying the Development cards a lot of the time is not such a bad idea!!

Update: Sept 2007, the three of us, dh, ds age 8 and myself are loving this game so have upped the rating from 6 to a 9
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My rating is now a weighted average: just Catan, 4; +Seafarers with a fixed scenario, 6; +Seafarers, exploring (flipping or drawing new tiles), 8; +Seafarers +5/6 expansions, exploring to a higher ending score (~20 points, not necessarily with 5/6 people), 9.

To my mind, the "real" game is Settlers plus Seafarers plus both 5&6 player expansions played on a big random map. This is just way too expensive for what is a light weight Euro.

A classic, perhaps one of the few euro-esk games I will ever really enjoy.  Because I am a Star Trek fan and the Star Trek version adds an interesting character mechanic and better theme, I would rather play that but this is still a solid game with light theme and it will forever remain one of the greatest games made because it ushered in a new board game era for gaming, particularly in the US.

THE classic. For some reason it never was as close to my heart as it is for most geeks. I think, the fiddly map, that falls apart everytime someone sneezes plays a role in that.

I really wanted to like this game, but in the end I decided this type of game is not to my style.  Basically, it is roll and trade.  The dice introduces both a (large) element of luck in the game, as well as strategy because of the different probabilities of rolling a particular number when two dice are rolled.  Unfortunately, the only thing that this game has going for it is the trading aspect-- if you dislike trading games (as I do), then you won't like this game.  I love trading when it is one element of a greater game, but not when it is, essentially, the whole game.

What can I say that so many have not already said of this hit.

I am giving Settlers of Catan a solid "10" because of the impact it had on my children. 

A game that frankly LOOKS boring holding it in the store turned out to be a huge winner in my immediate family.   My kids LOVE the trading aspect of the game and so do my wife and I.   Very fun, satisfying to win game.

Hate the Robber.

Lastly, THIS game at mere mention of playing it has my kids off their computers, putting their tablets down, and other forms of passive entertainment away.   It's a real family together time game, major success.

Brilliant game, it really creates a nice atmosphere, but it also can be cutthroat. 

With expansions, you can play this game many different ways.  Normally use Harbormaster and Fishermen modules.

I brought this when my current game group first got together and we played a few times, and it was well-received.  However, our group soon grew too large for it, and I stopped bringing it.  Some have moved away, though, and now we occasionally have the opportunity to play, and no one was disappointed.  As usual, it is a great gateway game.

I think, however, that it has been surpassed as a gateway game by Ticket to Ride - Settlers takes a number of turns before people "get it."  Ticket to Ride, people just jump in and go.

Good: Great game to teach to new gamers. Mixes resource management, open trading and strategic building very well.

Bad: I hate to jump on the "Catan is such a luckfest!" bandwagon, but I agree. The number of times I've won or lost because the dice were rolling N instead of N-1 is horrible and makes me not want to play the game.

Addictive and fun with good scalability as well. I'm not a huge fan of building the game boards with hex/octagons but this one is worth the effort and time. The randomness of building a board each time is what keeps this game feeling fresh in a way. It's also a very good "gateway" game.

I kinda think it was the world’s greatest gateway game. I have the same cliches about blowing Monopoly and Risk out of my personal waters. I still think that for non-gamers this can still be the ‘I didn’t know it could be like this’ moment that brings them to our side. But, after about 50 plays, including (especially) the app, it can be super frustrating that it relies on dice, the more normally distributed 2d6 notwithstanding. So now, I won’t play it unless some wide eyed newbie just heard about it and wants to play. After all those plays, I think that’s about all you should expect from a game - this one goes in the hall of fame.

Still enjoyable after all these years. The standard four player game is my favorite. Nice blend of player interaction (trading) with resource management. I find it amazing that the dice rolling alone turns some people off.

Here's a nice quip about the game:

"You don't like the dice? Go do Sudoku puzzles and cram your statistics textbook up your ass. The dice make the game dramatic, variable, and it forces players to adapt and adjust throughout the game. With trading, you are _never_ screwed unless you're one of those shrewish gamers who's afraid to speak up at the table to get what you want. Without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever published and a timeless classic." -- crackedlcd81

Settlers of Catan is the first German game that I ever played, and it has definitely led to an addiction.  I know a lot of people have played Settlers to the point of burn-out, but I am no where near that point yet.  I love the interaction of the trading phases, playing the seemingly fickle bell curve (Another six??? How's about an eight every once in a while??), and beating an opponent in a race to a crucial intersection.  We are still developing theories about the relative importance of each commodity (Good ol' rock, nothing beats rock), discussing whether nines are actually better than eights due to the robber effect, and making lots of sheep jokes.  To put it simply, Settlers is a lot of fun.

Swingy random resources, spiteful trading and take that cards make it a no-go for me.

RATING: 7
A much better game (maybe an 8) back in 1996 with the first german edition and bad english translation.  Could play any number of development cards.  There were less Knights in the Development card stack (as compared to the Mayfair games) and blowups required random discard. 

Hate the new plastic bits.

This game renewed my interest in board games. I though all there was was Milton Bradley games and D&D and nothing in between. 
Can be a bit overwhelming at first, but that happens when you're actually playing a game, rather than just rolling dice and letting a game play you.

The classic, and what started us into this hobby.  Feels a little old now, but we have played 1000's of games of it over the last several years.

RATING: 7
Somehow the best part of this game for me is the initial placement of settlements. It does a good job of making the trading aspect tempting enough to flourish without being so necessary that you can't turn your back on a deal. Some games stall out a bit in the middle and the fun drops precipitously at those times.

My personal Gateway Game.

Although more strategic than most games that are called "Gateways", Catan is a game that is easily taught and you can start playing quickly (even though you don't know what you are doing yet.)

We have worn out one set of cards. We don't play it as much which is sad.

Just a great game.

Oversaturation to the point where people are tired of seeing CATAN, you are deceiving yourself if you can't see the quality of this game.

My first love in board gaming. It's lost some of its luster over the years as I've discovered so many other amazing games. My main issue with it is that it's very possible to have a game become an exercise in frustration because the dice aren't rolling in your favor - and there's just nothing you can do about it. I'm ready to try some house rules to try to prevent that.

Dunno, just doesn't grab me. Maybe my expectations were too high, or perhaps I was too deep down the gaming rabbit-hole before I played it. I appreciate its value as a gateway, but TtR is still my gateway of choice when introducing non-gamer friends to the hobby.

I still enjoy Catan, but I've introduced it to a few non-gamers and had it fall flat when they got extremely competitive and upset with each other over the "I'm not trading with you, but will with them" parts.

My gateway game. I still love it if I am in the mood. My huge complaint about this game is that if you get bad placing (hopefully you get a spot you want) then you have to spend an hour and a half watching people play while you sit there doing something every once in a while. Its usually not that bad but if you play with someone that gets a bad spot, its kind of boring for them. Huge gripe, wish there was a way around it but its just a mechanic of the game.

My group has a great time playing Settlers of Catan. What makes the game fun for my group is the negociation aspect. Our trades are generally pretty creative. We trade current and future resources, and agreements not to steal resources. We also have a fun time convincing the person using the robber not to steal from us. If my group wasn't a high interaction group this game would definatley fall a minium of 1 points on my ratings.Most of our stradegy comes at the begining of the game as we take turns placing the terrain tiles and the numbers on those tiles individually. Our games runs from 2=2 and 1/2 hours.

It's an ok game, but I'm not much a fan for a few reasons:

1) the initial settlement placements are by far the biggest influence on the final outcome, making the rest of the game sometimes feel like a slog,

2) luck of the dice and card draws become too much of a boom and bust for the players, becoming another major factor on the final outcome,

3) there's inconsistent capacity for player agency in that a player who suffers from a bad run of dice rolls really can't do anything while a player who benefits from a good run can build an insurmountable position,

4) 90 minutes is simply too long for a strategy game that's more about luck than player decisions.

I'd like to try it with Cities & Knights to see if that wins me over.

A modern triggerpoint in gaming.The randomness in the die-roll can lead to a tedious play. Experience matters, as the savvy choice of starting locations can mean the game.

The expansions make the game better and alternate (historical) ways to play are much better, as is the two player card game version.

To be clear, my 8 stars is trying to be objective... if I'm being honest, I'd love to never play this game and you'd need to brow-beat me to get me to at this point... But that because I've played it SO many times because it is just SO good. It's a genre-breaker and a classic for a reason, it's a brilliantly designed game fit for causals or hardcore tacticians, total nerds or family game night with grandparents and nieces; it's simple, quick, and bland enough to not intimidate anyone, while complex enough to please real gamers. It's only redundancy and the fact recent games have filled the niche better that have this collecting dust on the shelf at this point... it definitely covered it's price tag in the day.
My one big piece of advice? Avoid the exapnsions. Like the plague. It's like how various "Battle chess" rules alterations to the namesake can't every live up to the original... the game is already in a good place tactically... Adding elements is supurfluous, and it makes it so you aren't getting better at Catan, you're getting better at screwy fake Catan. Being a grand-master chess player is impressive, nobody cares how you'd rank nationally in like Fantasy Chess or whatever... just get good at the game itself (or better yet, branch out to its successors... I suggest Machi Koro if you want something else outsider approachable, or Valeria Card Kingdoms if you want something deeper and nerdier.

It's a classic. It may be a bit dated, but it's like The Lord of the Rings - those reading it after reading the bazillions of things that ripped it off may think it's dated or boring or full of the fantasy tropes. But people forget, the reason those tropes exist is because of LOTR. Catan is no different for the BG world.

RATING: 9
An increadibly balanced game that suffers slightly from its random nature. At the same time, the random aspects keep the game interesting, ensuring that no two games are ever exactly the same and allowing new players a chance to compete with the more experienced. Settlers is a fantastic "2nd step" for new players that have tired of A Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne and are ready to try something new.

This game is beloved by many but I just can't see it. Its not a bad game just doesn't appeal to my tastes. I admit that there are aspects that I enjoy such as the randomness of resources, the thief, and the negotiations and politics in  resource management. Still overall I can't say I've ever really had fun and usually I'm clawing for a different game as soon as we start.

Finally played and it was pretty much just what I expected: boring gameplay, with the game mostly coming down to the luck of the dice and the luck of the card draws. It also seems like there is no incentive to trade because you would be just giving your opponent points in a game where every point matters.

New and experienced gamers alike: skip this and go straight to newer, better euros.

Regarded as THE Gateway game and I can't really disagree. While I don't look forward to playing much anymore, as it suffers from runaway syndrome and just doesn't have enough strategy, I still enjoy teaching it to a new player.

I need to use the deck of cards rather than dice to see if that changes a lot of the "stale" turns for players.

I've never owned it. But I finally played a game of it with my wife's family over Christmas. It was nice to finally play the classic gateway game. But I won't be adding it to my collection for the following reasons:

2. Enough of my friends own it that I don't need to own it.

It's Settlers.

Really like the way this is made. Unfortunately, the dice sometimes get in the way. If your numbers never come up in the beginning of the game, you'll never get any income to increase the numbers you can collect from. Law of averages may work for millions of games, but it doesn't always work for dozens.

My second Euro after Carcassonne. I'm not as enamoured about this game as most, however I'll concede that many of my games have been played with only 2 players and the game isn't designed as such. With two players, we play with unmodified rules except we roll twice each turn for resources.

20 plays: tried playing more games with three players but am finding the game even more tired and boring. It's the Eurogaming equivalent of Monopoly. Rating decreased from 6 to 4.

This was my only "designer" game for many many years.  I wouldn't be on BGG if it wasn't for settlers.  Have definitely seen a resurgence of this game lately due to it's discovery by a lot of non-gamer friends, which is ironic because I had unsuccessfully tried to get them to play it for so long.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Kelly

Why we culled it: Catan remains a wonderful game that deserves a place on "gateway game hall of fame" lists everywhere. We've played it a lot and have enjoyed it. Catan does a lot of things which have been done better in the two decades it took for the hobby to explode, and we found that we have discovered even better games to bring new friends into the fold. Catan sat for a long time, and I realized the best thing I could do with it was to send it to a group that was still just scratching the surface of the system. It continues to expose people to this wonderful hobby, and I'll happily join a game when it hits the table.

RATING: 8
I was not impressed with this game the first time I played it.  I think this is because the person who taught it to me didn't do a very good job.  Playing a second time, however, definitely changed my opinion of this game.  I think Carcassonne is better and am not sure if this should be called the "next monopoly" but this game is definitely fun.

The board is modular.  That's great isn't it?  More replayability!  Well....yes and no.  No two game setups are the same.  I like that a lot as there is no set strategy; you have to adapt to the game at hand.  Even with that though, the game is starting to feel like a lot of the same thing.  Maybe an expansion will liven things up again for me?  I did really like it the first dozen or so times I played it.  We'll see...

I have nothing to say about this that hasn't been said.

It is a quality game and I like to play it.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

I like Catan, but I'm just not super excited about playing it because there are so many things I'd rather play. The chance of the dice rolling doesn't bother me in and of itself so much as the fact that really the whole game boils down to that, it seems. I also wish there was more meat in the diplomacy aspects and more potential for direct competition and conflict. The Cities & Knights expansion is a must.

That said, it's a good game and a lot of fun and I enjoy the social aspect of trading. I also like that it has such broad appeal. If everyone and their uncle didn't own a copy, I might want to own it more badly. Maybe some day.

In the end, I find myself neither wanting to sing Catan's praises (the people who are like OMG, CATAN IS THE BEST/ONLY BOARD GAME), but nor do I totally get all the hate it gets from the pretentious board-game elitists.

Catan has this incredibly annoying “dice dependency”, which may crush your strategy. But one thing is for sure: there is not a single person who played the game for the first time at my house who did not like it.

It's "nice", I suppose. But I need an expansion, or I'll stop playing it altogether.

It's a fun game. It is, however, dependent on the dice to push the game forward. Between that and trading, the game can drag on sometimes. I also have a sneaking suspicion that if the numbers were generated by computer so that 6s and 8s really did happen more often than 5s and 9s, 4s and 10s, etc., then it would be a much better game.

At one time, no gaming get together was complete for my group without yet another game of Settlers (with expansions). Such was the enthusiasm that they readily embraced any new add-on and quirks and took them to their hearts, leaving me increasingly baffled, as the full house Settlers with everything added in is barely less complicated and slower than allegedly 'difficult' games that they constantly shied away from!

However, once everyone had had at least one game where they were squeezed into a tiny area of the board, with no hope of winning and some hours to go, the magic well and truly wore off.

It's a nice little game for 5, poor for 6 and too limited for 4 or fewer.

I played dozens of unlogged games of this before finding BGG, including quite a few when revisiting the game in the last quarter of 2006.  A great gateway game that is still fun to play.  I picked up [gameid=1137] and [gameid=926], but my interest has waned some and I haven't played any of those expansions (I traded [gameid=926] without giving it a go).  This will still get play every once in a while, but I'm not sure if it has a third wind now that I've plunged headlong into gaming.

The Timeless Classic.  It's truely great in almost every way.

my only gripes:

replay value is good but not great, i would say most can enjoy it for life and never get bored but a tru Gamer will burn out after a 100 games

strategy is good but not great, the trading system is a bit rudimentary and the placement can be a bit obvious if you're familiar enough with the game

The game mechanics work together in perfect harmony, the game has variable lengths of play per play and most important it's fun and emersive.

A moment of clarity sprung itself on me as I found myself openly and feverishly bartering for the attention and trade of two sheep for one wood over a competitors bid of two ore for one wood...........great stuff, I dived straight back in of course. 

My favourite game of all time.

RATING: 6
The historically quintessential German gateway game, and also the one game I find in the hands of people who have heard of little more than Monopoly.  It was the first game I bought when I decided to get serious about collecting German-style games, but I'm getting a bit worn out on it as I get deeper into the territory. 
 
9-2-08: Have to move this down to a 6.  I appreciate what this game has accomplished, but I've thought about trading my copy and would, were it not for the sake of respect, nostalgia, and some degree of hope that I'll find some resurgence in interest through one of the expansions, or the right group, or what have you.  As it is, can't think of a time when I wanted to pull it out even for old time's sake, and I'll even try to avoid playing it.  That probably means I should rate it a 4.  I'm not one to rag on a game just because it's popular, so that's not "it."  I think, at the risk of being inconsistent, it's ultimately the dice that do me in on this one.  I generally don't mind games which rely so heavily on dice rolling, but this is one that can really make me look at my watch if lady luck is canoodling with one of my rivals--there seems to be too little I can do in too long of a game.  

12-24-07: Played the game again recently on Xbox Live.  Maybe it's the extra options, the built-in session report, the detailed statistics tracking, or the sense of playing with an  animated version of the collector's edition, but I give it an extra point over the base board game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I enjoy this game, but I think the randomness just strikes me the wrong way.  I like randomness in my games, but the particular interaction between luck and skill in Settlers can just be frustrating.  I mean, it's been three turns since I've seen a new resource, and, oh look another 7!

I really like the variant where you reroll 7's for the first round.

Honestly just playing this sparingly enough makes it a better game :)

What can I say that hasn't already been said about this classic? One, the popularity of the TV show Big Bang Theory has gotten many non-gamers interested in playing this game. Two, when trading is involved women tend to join forces to take down their male counterparts. Three, this game can fail as a gateway game, so introduce it with caution.

It's a classic game, but it's been replaced by so many other games. It's still a good one to get people playing who aren't that into board games because they've heard of it. The randomness to it and the fact that it always plays the same (or similarly) keeps it from being rated higher, but there is some fun strategy.

My lower rating does not seem to reflect the general consensus. This makes me think that perhaps it is due to the group I played with, or some of the strategies they used (such as point blank refusing to trade).

RATING: 9
I must say its definately a great game.  I've played 2 and 3 player games so far and they've been entertaining.  I love the game because every time you play the board is different.  So its almost like playing an entirely new game every time.  

I highly recommend getting this for anyone looking to get into the more advanced board games but don't want to dive into the big expensive monsters quite yet.  

Instruction manual is easy to read and to look up things.  Also the useful website where they had game tutorials on how to play helped a ton.  I was able to pick up the game in one night.  Fairly simple game but still very strategic

The classic gateway game. Players that won't like this the first time they play will likely never rise above the non-gamer level. It's old however so there are better gateway games now.

This baby got me into board gaming. I played around 500 games of this before I realised that maybe I should see if there are other similar games out there :)

I strongly recommend the Cities and Knights expansion. Once you've figured out the few basic strategies of this it basically comes down to the dice - Cities and Knights opens up multiple paths to victory, and the game actually becomes quite strategic. Of course it is always gonna come down to die roll still, but I think it's a vast improvement if you don't mind more complexity. 

The rating is a bit down partially cause I just don't play it anymore since I've almost seen every possible because the newer games today, having improved upon this, scenario played out multiple times, also partially are just so amazing and well made that I have to rate this lower than those.

RATING: 6
This is the game that got me to love board games.   After this game gatewayed me to other designer games the fire to play has diminished severely.  Fun for a social environment, or if used as a gateway game.  Repeated playings will show the few number of real decisions for a player in the course of an hour.  I now think of it more as a party game,  and compare it to Apples to Apples and Scattergories.   This game holds its own.  Don't mess with the expansions or other "Things of Catan".  This is the gem.

The modular board and random placement of chits does not infuse a ton of replayability.  The strategies are the same, it just toggles the strength of them slightly.  The reason I probably over rank it based on my current desire to play it is with new players its way too slow for what the game has to offer, and with players who can get at this quickly there are games I enjoy more I'd rather be playing.  With that being said,  with a couple of cold ones the pacing of a snail does lead to a nice casual very social experience so I can't imagine ever turning down a game of vanilla settlers.

I gave it a whirl after it's been ages sinces I've fired this up.  It is still a good game, but not one of my favorites.

It is a bit of fun, but I find more frustration than anything else.  There is so much luck involved in winning.  That and a good placement at the beginning of the game.  When I'm down in the game, it's almost impossible to get back up, and it's so apparent who is winning, and you can only get ahead if the dice work with you, and need I mention anything else?

Don't enjoy this game that much. I won't protest if someone wants to play but I will never put it on the table myself. I hate sitting through a game of Catan in which the winner is determined in the first few rounds. Unfortunately, this is the case in most plays. I don't mind a luck factor in a game (for instance in Carcassone it doesn't bother me at all), but in this game I really dislike the luck involved with the dice rolling.

Settlers was for me, like many others I'm sure, THE gateway game, and will always hold a very special place in my heart.  I actually learned Settlers in 10th grade, every week I would go to a club at Cornell University where a bunch of the college students gathered to play games, almost exclusively Magic: The Gathering. I had been going for a couple years and would continue going for a couple more years, and throughout most of that time I mostly just played/traded Magic, spending far too much money in the process.  One fateful evening, I looked over and saw people playing this rather odd boardgame. Up until that point in my life I'd only played Monopoly, Risk, Life, Backgammon, etc. It looked so strange and interesting, I actually tore myself away from Magic for a few moments to watch. I became so engrossed that I watched the entire game. In fact, up until last year I'd never even read the rule book for Settlers, I simply learned by watching that game very closely. So throughout the years I started to play Settlers from time to time at that club at Cornell.  Eventually I even bought my own copy, which I found at the local comic book store; I bought the old brown Mayfair edition.  And I played this, and I played it some more, actually I played it for years and years.  All the time never stopping to realize that there might be more games out there like this one.  I loved Settlers, but somehow it didn't occur to me that there were other games of the same or similar ilk.  Fast forward a bit, I move to Chicago and go to college, I meet a couple good friends, and show them Settlers, the three of us end up playing Settlers almost every week together, and all this time, never think that there could be any other games out there I should be checking out.  So then I leave the country to study abroad, and while I'm away one of the friends I'd been playing Settlers with tells me about this board game fair on Navy Pier in Chicago and how he found out about and saw all these neat board games somewhat like Settlers but different and great, and they even had a giant life-size 3D version of Settlers.  I'm very jealous, but my interest is piqued.  Shortly thereafter, that same friend goes to California to visit someone, and comes back raving about this incredible game called Carcassonne that he was introduced to and that I just have to play. I'm like Carca-what?  He's like, you haven't heard of it?  I thought you were all into board games, isn't that your thing? And I'm like, uhh, no, I like Settlers, but haven't really ever played any other good games.  Anyway, I blame it all on him (or rather I thank him profusely) because from that point on I decided that maybe board games should be my thing, so I got Carcassonne shortly thereafter, played it, and fell in love with it.  My collection began to grow very quickly indeed, and now I'm as addicted as ever.  So it was Settlers that I played first, and Settlers will probably always be the game that I played most, I still can't believe it didn't occur to me for so long to see if there were more games I might like.

I am generally not a fan of eurogames, but Settler of Catan is a great game, and its rising popularity means most people have at least heard of it, even if they haven't played it. It's a good introduction to board games that don't suck, and is likely responsible for making some North Americans aware that adult board games don't have to last three hours.

I have played this a lot and still enjoy it.  Has a fair amount of luck, but that is what makes it fun!  The roll of the dice affects everyone and is met by cheers and groans each turn!  I also think that there is a lot more strategy and skill involved than many people give it credit for.  If you play board games to have fun with your friends and family, then you should check out this game.  When I play with my family I stick it to my brother by blocking his roads and trading tough, but I'm nice to my mom by giving her what she needs in trades.  This is one of the few games where you can be both nice and mean, which makes it suitable for most any mix of people.

At first this game was, in my mind, a 10 Perfect Score.
But after hundreds of games in person and on the mobile app you begin to realize that the game is basically 75-80% luck and the strategy really relies on the 1st move of the game. 

After the 1st and 2nd move you basically watch as the game plays you. 

Still a great game though but look for even better games.

A fun game, with a lot of variety since the board is dynamic and the abundance of resources different each time you play.

Tends to veer off towards the end game though, where you know who is going to win, or near enough.  

Also has a luck element due to dice dictating the resources that are produced.  However, it's mitigated by the known odds.

The game that got me into gaming. Its a great solid euro, that has proven its own worth through the test of time. Still play it every now and then, and even though i dont enjoy it as much as i use to because ive burnt it out, its still a fun play.

RATING: 8
Great game. A nice hand management game with strategy as a major component. Very easy to learn and teach. Secure resource tiles by placing settlement or cities via roads and use those resources to build more cities and settlements, can also buy economic cards to in crease resources or even an army. Enough depth to keep comming back to this game for hardcore gamers and not to complicated for the new or casual gamer.

I used to give Settlers a 10 (not because it's the perfect game) because it was my introduction to eurogames and it opened a whole new world to me. Boardgames were no longer Pictionary and Scrabble.

I've since downgraded my rating of it, purely because I've overplayed it and I really need to stop playing for a while.  It's lost much of it's attraction through overexposure.

RATING: 7
One of the games that introduced our group to the wonder of games beyond the Game of Life and Monopoly this is always a fun game that incorporates resource management and negotiation skills! The chance factor comes in the rolling of two dice for resource production, other than that the most crucial factor is deciding where to start. This game can only really get unfair if in a custom game the hexes and counters favour one/two people and screw the rest over. Usually a fun game it always ends up with one person shut out and feeling dissatisifed therefore I would also like to see a variant of random/forced trading to even things out.

I'm new to Eurogames and I readily admit to loving this one. I've only played a handful of games, but it feels well-balanced to me, if not a bit iconography-challenged. (I'm sure others have ranted about the ore/brick color schemes.)

I'm in the honeymoon phase where I will enlist nearly anyone to play with me. I have not, however, endeavored to teach it to my kids yet (currently ages 7 and 5). They are swimming in new eurogames, and I would like them to enjoy the ones they're currently playing for a while longer.

A seminal Euro, of course. Not my favorite because trading is not my forte, but a very solid little game. Can't take it too seriously because the dice certainly are out to get you from time to time, though that risk can be managed more than some give it credit for.

RATING: 8.5
This is a great game system and an essential for any collection.  20 years after its release, it is still a fantastic gateway game, and I often have friends that don't play board games asking to play.  There is a reason why this game has been able to break in to the American market when so many others have failed; it implements mechanics that most haven't seen in games (resource management, trading, engine building) in an extremely elegant and simple way.  The game is perhaps too simple and luck-reliant to have longevity for a lot of hobby gamers (the expansions do help with this problem), but it is worthy of the popularity that it has.

RATING: 8
My introduction into Euros, and I still won't pass on an opportunity to play. However, the pricing structure of this cash cow is a massive barrier to entry. Want an expansion? That'll be the same amount as the base game. Want to play 5 or 6 players? that'll be $20 per for the base game and an additional $20 for each expansion. If that's what the market will bear, then I'm not the target market.

I lose this game a lot, but it is the standard by which I judge all multiplayer games.  Why not a 10?  Hard to teach (any action can be taken any turn), setup takes an age, and no two player variant in the box.  The beginner board suggested in the almanac helps with teachability, pushing this to a 9 rather than 8.

Fun, simple mechanics with lots of possibilities for scheming and backstabbing.

The game has some major problems though. It is for example very possible for one player to be totally screwed and has no chance of winning after just the first two turns or so, which makes the game really crappy for that player. In general.

Ahh.. the game that started it all for so many of us.  There are so many fond memories of this game that I have to rate it as a minimum 7... however I have out grown it and I pretty much only play it in the name of nursing someone along the path of getting to the real board games...

RATING: 7
Great, and the randomness prevents it from being too competitive.  Unfortunately, it can also mean that luck essentially screws you sometimes and you have a terrible game.

Never play with 4 on the standard-sized board - someone inevitably is out of the running within 3 or 4 rounds.  Then they have another hour of tedium and frustration.

This is the original board game I played that drew me away from games like "Skip-bo", and "Monopoly".  I always loved board games, but these games drive my obsession.  The level of strategy offered is so much greater than games I grew up with, and this was the catalyst.  However, it's mechanics are a little weak compared to some of the others.  Mainly, you can still lose to the dice, rather than lose to the opponent.  And while I don't dare rate this game any lower than an 8, it really has fallen out to just a good game that I like to play.

A great game that I often use as a gateway to get my friends involved in playing boardgames. Most people who are used to playing things like Monopoly and Scrabble are a little intimidated at first with the "large" amount of rules, but learn it pretty quickly and quite enjoy it after a round. The hardest thing to grasp is the fact that initial placement can have a lot to do with the outcome of the overall game.

I'm liking this game more and more over time. My wife and I have tried many 2-player variants but they never pan out terribly well. It's a lot of fun with 3 or 4 players. For me, the meat of the game tends to be in the initial setup (placement of first two settlements). Sometimes the dice just hate you. But in all that chaos, there are multiple adaptive strategies.

I liked this quite a bit when I first started playing it on the computer (as an MSN Games download). I got tired of it pretty quickly though. As fickle as it sounds (and is), I think I'd like this game more if it had better artwork. I purchased the travel edition to play instead of the regular version, solely because it looks better. I might pick up the 4th edition as it looks nicer to me.

A good family game with a lot of luck and some negotiation that can be fairly nasty, via the robber and trading boycotts.  This nastiness is surprising, given how popular the game is in Germany.  It makes one wonder whether the "conventional wisdom" among German publishers that player conflict is to be avoided is actually accurate for the German market...

When all's said and done, I tend to prefer vanilla Settlers to its various variants and expansions.

Probably one of the best gateway game ever! If You want to show what is boardgame to young children, or students, or parents etc. - You can succesfully use Settlers of Catan.

After 10 times of playing it, I still can't remember really enjoying my experience with Settlers; you spend the whole game trading for cards and then once you have the cards you need there are only 4 different possibilities to use them.  It seems like the same thing always happens: the robber always visits the same spots, someone who had a bad starting position can never do well, and lastly whoever is close to winning the game will meet the demise of other players refusing to trade w/ him or her.  The only true remaining value I see in this game is that it is a good game for new gamers because of how easy it is to learn and the time length 45-90 minutes.

1/16/11: I've been playing this a lot lately because my six year old son really enjoys it.  He doesn't get the nuances of balancing probabilities, and his trades are often very lopsided (I'll give you three ore for your sheep).  But we have fun, and I'm reminded of what a great, replayable game this is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good:
-Trading
-Lots of player interaction
-Borderline gateway game
-Easy to understand and execute strategies
-Cheering for die rolls

Bad:
-Waiting on rolls
-Balance issues (city strategies are too good)
-Encourages mean-spirited play
-A little long for what it is
-Starting villages typically determines who will win

Overall:
The player interaction that comes from trading adds a lot of interaction and seems to be the main selling point.  But trading slows the game down and gives savy players an even bigger advantage.  This was one of the best gateway games when it came out and holds a special place in my heart but I now struggle to find a reason to play it.  It's not deep enough for play with hobbyists, not a top-tier family weight game, and not ideal for introducing the hobby.  While I definitely got my moneys worth, it will be collecting dust for the foreseable future.

RATING: 7
Not a bad little game. Placement and die rolls can kill you, but as long as the map is not overcrowded usually you can give it a good go. Negotiation is not a "bad" feature as long as everyone knows the game and knows how to wisely negotiate. Playing with someone who gives another player whatever they want or because they are charismatic will kill it though.

RATING: 6
A classic that completely deserves all the international awards (and commercial success) it received. Still, in my humble opinion, it did not stand the test of time very well. When compared to modern day classics, it suffers from a lack of options and the fact that it really only shines with three players (with four, one player runs out of building sites very, very quickly). Much, much better with the Cities & Knights expansion. As far as cosmetics are concerned, I much prefer the original version with its wooden components.

Rating given for a three player, bog standard game. 

Four player games tend to become tedious and too frustrating for enjoyment. The strength of the game lies in its simplicity, and any expansion or "improvement" detracts from this.

NOT a gate-way game. My first encounter with Settlers almost put me off German games for life, but then the rules were poorly explained and I was constantly being clobbered by the robber.

Catan was my first modern board game, and to this day, it's still one that I will still take out to play. While it's true that poor starting locations can lose you the game from the very beginning, Catan's negotiation system allows for an interesting experience granted that the rest of the group is willing the play along.

RATING: 9
Excellent game. There are so many things to like about this game. Everyone is involed every turn so there is no "dead time" between your turns. It is simple and it is short but there is a lot to it. I really like the trading aspect of the game. If you are shrewed and trade well you will win a lot of games. Also the other players tend to gang-up on the leader which tends to make every game a close finish which is always exciting. We have played this to death but still enjoy it everytime we play.

Settlers of Catan fits the definition of gateway game quite well.  There is a good balance of luck and strategy.  The game can be easily taught in ~7 minutes and anyway, a new player can learn 90% of the game by just being the last player (i.e. watch the others play).  Negatives include the initial setup time and difficulty in recovering when behind (i.e. generally 1 or 2 players do really well while the rest aren't even close).

Instead of houses and hotels, you have settlements and cities.  Instead of Income and Luxury Tax, you have the Robber.  Instead of Boardwalk and Park Place, you have wood and sheep.  Instead of Community Chest and Chance, you have development cards.  Instead of trading, you have... trading.  Instead of "roll 2d6 and pass the dice", you have... roll 2d6 and pass the dice.

It may have a slightly more manageable timeframe and no player elimination, but let's face it: Settlers is really Monopoly in disguise.

And that's why it's so successful.

Although it's lost much of its appeal to me, I still hold it in a very good spot in my heart for being a game that I played for years, before I even knew of modern board games. The first gateway game, even though dice can be somewhat of an annoyance, I'll still play it now and then. And even beyond its flaws, it's still a great game with one of the best direct negotiation/commerce features I've yet to see in a board game.

I really liked Settlers when I first got it as part of the modern wave of board games, but it's steadily gone down in my ratings as I get other games I like more. I'm not a fan of the random resource generation, and the end result of your city and road building isn't nearly as satisfying as in other games such as Ticket to Ride and Agricola. At this point I'll only play it if someone else really really wants to play it.

If you are only considering the game design and the ratio of luck to strategy, there are definitely better games than this. However, I have more memories of awesome times I have had playing this game than with any other game. It is very much dependent on the people playing, as I had played games that were not much fun because the players played too seriously or one player accepted pretty much any trade offer. I have won this game by only building on two hexagons before (I had four cities and believe it or not, Longest Road.) I have played a game where we combined two base sets and played to 25 VPs. It lasted three hours, but it was awesome and one of the most fun times I have had playing a board game. I love the intellectual challenge and brain burn of other games, but with the right players, Settlers is a blast, and still has enough strategy and tactics to keep me interested.

RATING: 7
This game opened the door for me to the possibilities of board games, circa 1998.  The only reason it's this low is that our copy has literally been played to death, with massive amounts of wear and tear on everything.  If I logged them all, there'd be hundreds of plays of this game for me.

I won't let my husband get rid of this game, even though we rarely play it.

It's not my favorite. It seems the dice are never with me. Or they are, and they are killing someone else so much that it makes me feel bad.

But, like a lot of people, this was the game that introduced me to modern board games.

Because of that, it's one our friends who don't really game are always willing to play.

I only played it twice, but that was enough to realize the game was not for me. It is a game where the rich gets richer, which also leads to the runaway leader problem and thus, to king making. I also didn't like the constant bickering about the resource trading which just slowed the whole game down.  In both games, I could pretty soon say who's gonna be the winner which made the entire experience pointless. I sincerely don't understand such a love for this game. I could see myself playing this a few more times, but I doubt I gonna change my mind.

RATING: 7
I realized the reason why Catan is so great is that your settlements and cities reach their ideal productive capacity right as the game is ending.  That feeling of getting 3 Ore in a turn, or 4 resources overall - it feels really good, and you want to have it again, so you play again.  I feel like it's hip to badmouth Catan and it wouldn't be my first, fifth, or even tenth choice to play were it my option, but I've played it live more than any other game; it's held up pretty well.

EDIT 11/17 - I'd like to lower my rating of Catan, but it's me that's changed and not the game - I've just played it too many times.

Out of the 2 or 3 groups I've played with on a regular basis this is just a classic and can't be replaced. We may not play it as much nowadays, but it's the first thing we start our newbies out on and it's always something people are glad to see out on the table.

Settlers of Catan is worthy of being in every gamer's library, and serves as a wonderful gateway drug.

The random setup and dice-rolling aspects of this game can infuriate players who have grown accustomed to more refined Euros, but this is one of the first crossovers that introduced many of us to grown-up board games, as we know them.

Resource management and negotiation somewhat mitigate the randomness, which is why I consider this game a notch better than Carcassonne.

Pros: gateway strategy game, network building integrated with resource management, direct player interaction with trading mechanic, variable board set-up, high replayability

This game had more or less passed me by until I was already quite engaged with the hobby of boardgames. Had to pick it up just to see what the fuss was about. I'm not 100% sure it deserves its supposed classic status but I can see its appeal as a gateway game. There are much more fun family games out there and far deeper euros... but not many that attempt both. 

I find the theme a bit too dry.

Edit: just got bored of it. Sold.

RATING: 7
Got me re-interested into board gaming around 1999 as my first foray into the world of Euro-games. Better yet, it got my spouse into board gaming and was easy to introduce to family members and friends, even if they didn't want to play nearly as often as I'd like. Loved the modular board adding replay value, the non-traditional use of dice in a game, indirect confrontation through competition for spaces, and interactivity brought about through trading - all in a game that runs 45-90 minutes. 
Some minor flaws: bad initial placements can lock a player out early, serious opportunities for kingmaking if losing players freely trade with leaders close to finishing, while unbalanced starting boards that make resources unusually scarce or group dynamics that don't favor trading can result in games that drag longer than they should. Played 20+ more times than logged on BGG.

RATING: 9
However recently I've played this game - even if I've just played it twice on the trot - I'll always want to play it again.  I've played it many, many times and it is still as enjoyable as ever.  That's how addictive it is.  I still find the basic game superior to any of the expansions because of its elegance and simplicity.

I never played a game as much as this one, and it introduced me to board gaming's new age.

[i]"Poor. Likely won't play this again although could be convinced."[/i]

Showing its age. Front-loaded importance of decisions, poorly controlled variance, and despite theoretically engaging all players at all times it has great potential for downtime or even essentially wasted turns.

I don't like the politics in it either but admittedly that's the thing that makes it unique. Archipelago embraces this more fully and is a better game for it.

This is a classic game that was ground-breaking when it was released 20 years ago. However, I'm bored with it, and like the first model of anything, there are dozens of games now with similar themes that followed the Catan model, but which are much better, such as Terra Mystica, so I never play this any more unless everyone I'm with insists on playing it.

Great accessible game, engaging without being complex. It's great fun, and games are done in less than 120 minutes. I just wish it was a better two-player experience, however; there are evenings where I would like to play it alone with my husband, but it's not very good for that.

There are several better gateway games.  This can run long, and there can easily be 30-60 minutes of the end game where 1 or 2 players have no chance to win but have to keep playing anyway.  Luck is also a fairly major factor for the game's length, as good luck early on is significantly more powerful than good luck later.

I'd consider myself officially graduated from Settlers of Catan. It's an amazing gateway game that just doesn't have the legs once you get introduced to other better games that are a bit more hardcore. I'd always recommend this for beginning gamers, but it doesn't last through a few play throughs. I'm glad that I have the good edition of this though because the newest version is pretty aweful. I like playing this with Cities and Knights expansion.

I’m being too hard on the game for sure considering I’ve only played the game once. But I found the game boring. Especially since the group that I was gaming with walled me as a group before my second turn began from the entire board limiting me to 2 cities and then telling to trade with someone to get resources. When following said advice for the remainder of that 2 hour game, I was universally rejected. That game alone has turned me off to the game.

Still love this game for what it was. It was an obsession for a solid year before I found other board games.  Playing it again recently though, it's showing it's age. Board is so crowded with 4 that it doesn't feel like you're getting anywhere. Everything is so luck driven.  Monopoly cards can feel overpowered yap to the right time.  Robber can be devastating and obnoxious. Turns can drag. Border tiles warp.

I'd like to try some expansions, but I don't think I'll go back to the base game again.

1st update (Sep 2010)[6]: My very first "real" board game. I have played this game tens of more times than anything else, and it would still be one of the go-to games for my family. Nowadays I rarely play it, since it can take hours to complete, and we'd rather play something more rewarding. It IS a very good game though, and the rating given is of how often I play it.

My feelings echo Phoebe Wild's : 

"Yes, it was "the" first game I played which got me into strategy games and Eurogames to start with, but I find now that I get sick of it 15 minutes into a game and start counting points hoping for someone to win. I think this is because it's a game with limited options, and limited things a player can do to improve their options. Beyond the initial placement of settlements, resource gaining depends on dice rolls and the kindness/naivety of the other players. And if neither of those are in your favour, you can watch turn by turn pass not building anything, while everyone else picks up 5 resource cards a turn. It either goes splendidly or horribly, but either way it isn't really in your control."

I love negotiation games, and this is no exception. I think my favorite part of the game is extorting other players while still maintaining a diplomatic relationship.

"Well, it's not like I want to block off your road, but I just don't have the resources I need to do anything else this turn. If you give me some stone to upgrade my settlement I won't have to block you anymore."

The 5-6 player extension is a trap.

When my roomate first introduced me to this game, we played it 7 times in the first two days.  Years later, I still love this game, because of the memories of first playing it, but I can't really rate it very high any more.  The random factors are just too great in this game, although the cards from the barbarian expansion probably helps that a lot.

I built my own board out of wood now, and built my own pieces.  That should indicate how much I've actually played this game.  I've played most often with one or more expansions, and back when I played it regularly, I didn't know about BGG.  So, most of my plays of this game have not been logged.

A great game that keeps hitting the table for it's simplicity and easy set up. This is the gateway game for new board game groups. Highly addicting initially, and still a good time after many plays.
There's a lot of luck and it can be frustrating when your resources are not rolled or when you get hopelessly blocked in. A good strategy will only take you so far. I suppose this is what makes it good and fair for experienced and new gamers.
If you like it and want an expansion then the best one is Catan Cities and Knights hands down. You don't need any other expansion and in fact many of them don't combine well.

Fantastic light play.  This is the game for non-gamers that I always trot out.  Moves along quickly, and doesn't encourage overly competitive new gamers (you know who they are) to get angry at others.  It also has enough strategy to satisfy the gamers in your group.  I don't tend to play it with other serious gamers anymore, but it got much of my group and me into the gaming scene.  Its reputation as a classic is well-earned.  Revolutionary then, and still revolutionary for most people now.

This is the game that got me started in gaming.  At the time, I would have rated it a 12 out of 10 because it was so much better than anything I'd ever played before.  However, over time, I've found there are better games out there.  It's still a good one, but not one I pull out very often anymore.

Fun game with just the right amount of player interaction, but easy to get screwed by bad die rolls.  I got very burned out on this game after playing extensively 1996-1999.

RATING: 7
A classic.  Loved it from the first time i played it.  The only frequent issue is that certain crops "drought" rather badly when playing, making the game sluggish.  That having been said, I LOVE trading, and this scratches the trader itch very well.

The balance of the game is really good and I like the fact that there is some cooperative interaction during the trading. 

It is also a game that I can get people interested in.   An eight year old has played the game several times with us.  She has the basic concept of the game and she has even won once.

The game that got me into the hobby so I appreciate that I am biased in my love. However I think it's a truly great game with a healthy dose of negotiation and strategy. It can be random due to the dice but you can always make a spirited comeback and rarely is there a runaway winner. I will always come back to this game.

The antipode to Monopoly: Finally a really good game that everybody knows. It has saved the public reputation of the hobby. While appealing for experienced gamers, it is also a perfect game for beginners and occasional gamers. I'm not playing it that much any longer, though (even for introducing beginners / casual gamers, there are other alternatives by now), so I can't give the honorary 10 here any longer. Still the grade includes a 'historic' bonus.

Ah...Catan. Such a polarizing beast. At this point, I most enjoy playing it with my wife where we both control two players and we don't play with the robber. As our collection has grown, Catan has fallen to the wayside in favor of other games. Nevertheless, I can certainly see us playing it from time time in the future.

The classic euro. My gateway game. I'm not sure why this is such a good gateway, maybe it's the negotiation aspect, the dice, the simplicity of the building/resource management; maybe it's the notoriety or the "brand" that keeps people from being turned away. I think everyone should have this game in their collection. It's not my favorite game, or even my favorite gateway game, but it's *the* classic gateway euro, in my opinion.

Rated after 23 confirmed games with different opponents. In first games there was lots of interaction between players, but later the interaction level drops down when players don't try to propose every possible trade. In the end, when players have more or less experience, the interaction between players is quite scarce. A good game in good company, but the benefit of experience means this is not a game I would like to introduce to new players.

Randomness in the setup means that this game is very playable for long time. Unfortunately my latest games have used the beginners' setup.

Updated after 24th and 25th plays, introducing the game to new beginners despite the comment above. After all, this is a classic game everyone should know. Let's say, I won't introduce this one to non-players very easily. :) Updated the rating from 7 to 8. Now three plays of Catan on three consecutive Tuesdays, but still without expansions...

I have several small expansions for this game, looking forward to try them sometime, when there are no beginners around.

Settlers is a light-weight game that works well for a family get together setting. Its greatest asset is the trading mechanic. This can be a hard-core strategy gamer's nightmare with all the dice-rolls. It takes a  little too long to play for my taste and sheep can be an over-abundant resource if you play it with the base game only (an issue fixed by Seafarers). Still, it is easy to bring this out on the table more often than not and everybody loves to hate the Robber.

One of the 'founding fathers' of modern board games.  Cata is straight forward, has a high level of interaction, and is compact.  That being said, starting position and early rolls have a HUGE impact on your chances to succeed.  This game is largely focused on dice rolls - so luck/randomness is a major element in Catan.

Catan isn't a fair game, but it's still quite a bit of fun due to resource trading interaction between players.

A fine game, that I problably never would have picked up if it hadn't been the only "real" game available in a Brazilian gameshop. It's a little bit too luck-based, but nothing serious.

Gave it a 3 because I could MAYBE be talked into it. Hoping to never play again though. Owned it for a few years and played it on a few family get togethers with people who don't usually play games.  That's kinda the problem right there, is that this is a game for non-gamers.  Those people all seem to like how simple and stupid and random it is.  I got an expansion hoping it would make it better, but it was a whole lot of time for an abysmal game experience.  My wife and I never wanted to play again after that.  Gave the thing to the local thrift store. 

How is this game grouped into the strategy game category when games with WAY more strategy are left out?  This game is a trend that will one day totally die out, just like Trivial Pursuit.  The game play and game design are below average.  I would rather play Monopoly any day.

One of the new classic games. Luck plays a role. Might Wanda try the rule below:

The random dice drove me nuts. I'd be sitting on a 6, 8, 5 and 9, and everyone would be rolling 4's and 10's. I later learned of a rule used in Settlers of America: If your number isn't rolled, you gain 1 gold coin. On your turn, you can exchange 2 gold for any 1 resource at. You can do this twice per turn (you can spend a max of 4 gold per turn). If a number is rolled but is blocked by a robber, that player does not receive gold.

I honestly don't care for this game. It's too simple and slower than I wanted it to be. I hate the dice rolling and the amount of time spent collecting random resources. Dice were a bad call, I think. It's also hard to care about who wins or loses as the game is pretty bland theme-wise. My biggest gripe is actually that the pieces don't fit in the frame and slide all over the place. That drives me nuts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
With a "difficult" starting position and a few unlucky rolls of the dice you may practically be out of the game after a few minutes, and the rest of the game is an exercise in enduring an hour of pointless boredom to wait for someone else to win the game. Avoid.

Yeah, yeah, yeah - the bad luck evens out over several games, but why play this poorly designed game several times when there are hundreds of much better games, today.

Luck in games is perfectly fine to change your odds or to determine your available options etc. - but not to determine if you are in or out of the game from the beginning or after a few rounds.

Buy it and put it on your personal "boardgame museum" shelf, next to Monopoly, of classic, but bad and never to be played again, boardgames, if you must, but there are many, much better games to buy and play.

Would only ever play this game again to try the "Welfare variant" (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/150443), or the "Event cards variant" (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20038) which may solve/reduce the luck problems.

Klaus Teuber; In Settlers of Catan, players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine the current production on the island. Players collect raw materials to build up their civilizations to gain enough victory points to win the game. This game is a Spiel des Jahres (German game of the year, 1995) winner, primarily because of its amazing ability to appeal to non-gamers and gamers alike. Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by Kosmos and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone at least 4 editions as Settlers of Catan. It has also been re-published in a travel edition by Kosmos and in yet a different edition for Japan/Asia, Settlers of Catan : Rockman Edition. Settlers of Catan is the original game in the Catan Series. Expanded by: The Seafarers of Catan, The Cities and Knights of Catan, 5-6 Player Expansion.

4 joueurs : plus de partenaires d'échanges mais plus de risque qu’un joueur se retrouve bloqué dans la construction de ses routes et cités. Personnellement à 4 joueurs, je conseille fortement l'utilisation des tuiles de l'expansion "5/6 joueurs" pour agrandir l’île afin que tous y soient à l'aise.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
1e jeu de type "Allemand" que j'ai essayé, suite à un achat "au feeling", et qui a marqué le début de ma découverte des jeux Allemand & Euro. Personnellement, je m'en suis lassé rapidement parce que je le trouve trop hasardeux et répétitif. Cependant, il est fort apprécié par mes joueurs occasionnels (qui demandent régulièrement à y rejouer) et je pourrais le présenter aux novices curieux de s’initier aux jeux de ce genre. À noter qu'il s'agit d'un classique et qu’à ce titre, il vaut bien une partie d’essai ne serait-ce que pour son importance dans l’histoire des jeux et pour mieux comprendre tout le chemin parcouru depuis.

There's also the possibility of winning the game strictly off of a blind draw from the deck, but to be fair, you still have to set yourself up to be in the position to pull that sort of thing off.  Additionally, I think it plays better with 4 than with 3, because there are more people involved, more numbers being rolled, and more trading going on.  In short, it has more possibilities.  It's still a fun concept, and still a great game!

Despite the fact that it has dice (therefore luck) it is a fun game. I have played it many times since now, and it seems that i will also play it in the future. A must-buy for all those who like games with resources.

Edit: After some time now, I have adjusted the rating to 7 which is closer to my gaming preferences right now.

Also my gatewaygame into boardgames. I played it a lot. Its a very good game, minimum downtime, lots of trading, building, stealing :-). I like the fact that you can create your own board.
One issue: luck, after numerous plays it kind of bugged me, but still it is a must-have.
Next time catan will appear on the table, i'll try one of those bgg variants.

Good game.
I don't really like strategy because I don't like heavy thinking. So I basically lose every game. 
But the group I play with have a lot of fun.
It's more intense and perhaps fun with the expansion (Traders and Barbarians) and we hardly play it without the expansions, unless we are teaching a new person.

This was the game that got me into the hobby back in high school, so I will always enjoy it. I do prefer it with Cities & Knights because I think it offers a balance to the game, as with the base game it seems like a race to see you can build cities first (which usually means they win from my experience). I wish there were ways to mitigate the muck of the dice roll.

We like the mechanic whereby you collect commodities (wood, clay, sheep, ore, grain), which you then invest to purchase appropriately themed items (settlements, roads, cities) on the board.

The die-roll mechanic for determining what is harvested can be cruelly unforgiving (even if you hedge by placing settlements adjacent to as many different numbers as possible). We've tried the event cards and our initial reaction is positive. But, for a fairly quick empire-building game involving trading and luck - it's fun. My BGG plays record only a small fraction of the nearly 100 times we've played this game.

This game is truly a classic. Has a lot of luck but skill is more than essential to be a good player because things to pay attention to are very subtle. The great thing about Settlers is that it can be a beer & pretzels game but it can also be a very competitive game.

In Settlers of Catan, players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game. Multi-award-winning and one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to non-gamers and gamers alike.

I hate how the most complex decision is at the very beginning of the game, when you place your first settlement. After that, it is often close to autopilot (trading is pretty easy, despite what anyone says) and very luck based. This makes the flow of the game pretty anticlimactic. People go into huge AP as they place their first settlements, and then just sort of sit there while the dice determine the winner. This can be immensely frustrating, since after agonizing over the correct play and finally placing the settlement perfectly, you often just lose to variance anyway. For how difficult placing your settlement tends to be, it's often not worth the mental effort.

The game is also MEAN. Placed your road the wrong way? Too bad, player 3 cuts you off in the settlement placement and you're screwed for the entire game. Are you winning? OK, expect the robber baron to land on your settlements every time a 7 is rolled. This is just NOT ok for a casual, luck-based game - I want my casual games to feel casual, not like some cutthroat brawl.

The game gets better if you play with only 3-4 players on the 6-player expansion. There, there's enough room so that people get randomly screwed less, and placing settlements is also easier due to the large availability of "good" places.

A solid game, but not one I really go out of my way to play. I completely understand the game's popularity and its historical significance. Without Settlers, board games would still be relegated to the toy aisle. I also realize that many people cut their Eurogame teeth on Catan and most of those who did are still absolutely loyal to it. I get it, but I still would rather play something else.

As one of the first Euro's to cross the pond, it often gets a free pass for the parts that don't always work. I'm not usually one to bitch about randomness, but I have had more than a couple of experiences where I've had to sit around for half an hour doing nothing because my territories simply would not produce. Again, I know that's just a dice thing and it's not likely to happen ALL of the time. It just seems to really irritate me when it does happen...and it always seems to ruin my experience.

Does a lot of things well, in particular the fairly open trading rules, but there are two major issues I can't get past. First, there's enough strategy that you have to play well to win, but the dice add just enough randomness that the best strategy often will lose to a decent one. I've lost games I should have won due to dice, and worse still, I've won games I had no right winning because of them. In some ways, this is almost more irritating to me than games that are mostly luck, because it gives you the illusion that your strategy matters. As of this writing, the most recent game I played is a good example of this. I was on two 9 hexes of the same resource, which I had a 2:1 harbor for. Another player was on several of the 6s and 8s, and had high probabilities for all resources - but no 9s. We proceeded to roll something like 7 9s in 10 turns, allowing me to rally and take the lead to win. Some might call that risk/reward; for me, that was a hollow victory. My bigger problem with the game is that the structure makes it so that some players may face a fate worse than elimination: being mathematically eliminated from victory but forced to sit through until the end of the game anyway. Some have argued that a shrewd trader can still come back, but it's very apparent when someone cannot do it themselves, so only a pity trade could help them, and nobody likes a pity trade. This probably sounds overly negative, and it's probably a testament to the rest of the design that I still give it a 6 after all that complaining. Those two points are pretty much the only faults I have with the game itself. (Mayfair's pricing practices are another matter...)

Can see the appeal of this being an entry game.  However, the game is pretty much all about initial placement then letting the game play itself out. One bad placement and you're stuck doing nothing for the entire game, leaving unfortunate players bored for a really long time.  The game could use a serious catch up mechanism or at least something to do that doesn't involve a heavy dependency on a dice roll.

Would only play again if it was only the base game with 3-4 players with no house rules and if someone REALLY wanted to play it because they didn't know any better.

If I was rating the horribly house-ruled 5-6 player version I played in Japan, it would have gotten a 1.

One of my favorite games. I've been playing this since it came out in Germany and it was the first game I gave to my wife long before we married and it is still her favorite game. It's a game for the whole family and can be easily tought to friends willing to try board games. Even young children can play the game (mine wanted to change over from the kid version to the adult version at around age 6). Depending on the group you play with this can be a very communication intensive game as the trade aspect will decide the game most of the time. There is however a chance that luck will screw you but I play the game with statistics in mind, so I know things like that smooth out with the size of the sample ;)

Sigh - poor Catan. I get it. I get what was great about it. It was 1995. If you haven't found at least 30 games that do it better by now, you're in a rut and need to get out. Alternatively, you think you're not in a rut and I will never play with you.

As I keep saying elsewhere in my comments, I'm yet to see any game nail negotiation. In real life, negotiations fulfill the purpose of mutually benefiting both sides. This is inherently against the spirit of competition in board games, so there's no point in negotiating fairly or justly. Catan is the quintessential example of negotiation prolonging the game far beyond any acceptable period of play time.

A lot to like here, but a few nits as well: too much hinges on too few die rolls, usual runaway loser, occasional runaway leader. Baffled as to why they keep meddling with the English art, as the German/original is still the best, hasn't changed, and they don't monkey with the rest of the Kosmos line.  Weird.

But the biggest issue, esp. now that I have Seafarers and 5/6 expansion, is just figuring out the setup and takedown. Extremely annoying to have different sets of chits, etc.  I've done a bit of marking-up and it works, but...poorly thought out on Mayfair's part.

Great game to play with non-gamer types. Met one of my best friends over a game - I think he hated me after I asked him about a trade then played a robber to steal it instead. We still laugh about the incident now though. My group have never trusted me in any kind of backstabby game ever since ;)

If I can only name one game as boardgame classic, the vote will DEFINITELY go for this game. Not necessarily be the most compact/fun/tricky or whatsoever, game, Settlers is the game you should at least played once and I gurantee you are willing to play it again and again

The game that got me, like many others, into the wide-world of German games.  Contrary to my low play count, I've got hundreds of plays, since this and Puerto Rico were my only two Eurogames for a long time.  During college, I came home for dinner and a few games of Settlers most every weekend (mostly with the Seafarers expansion).  We finally got burnt out on it, but it had a hell of a run.

After a couple years off, I'm starting to rediscover its greatness as a game system with the Cities and Knights and Traders and Barbarians expansions.

RATING: 5
This is the fist hobby board game that really got me into gaming.  I remember playing this game for the first time and thinking WOW! This is amazing there has to be other games like this!  and 6 years later I have a wall of games and its all thanks to this game.  I think the trading is phenomenal in this game, and the building up your settlements is cool.  Plus, all the expansions for this game allows for variety.  The problem lies with there too much time of rolling dice...oh I rolled nothing...well can't do anything this turn... and that is FRUSTRATING!!  Plus what will everyone have the most of? SHEEP!!! USELESS SHEEP!!  Seafarers kind of fixed this issue but not enough for me to want to play the game.  At this point, Machi Koro gives me the same feeling and I like it better.

RATING: 8
Routine gamers like to hate on this game but I still like it. Sure I like a heavier game at times and I'm not a hardcore gamer but this game still has it's place. Just enough luck to allow less experienced players to win from time to time but still experience driven. You can't say it's all luck if the same 2 people win 90% of the time :-p. I'll always keep this in my collection and pull it out from time to time. I don't care for the expansions though (only played seafarers and cities/knights) except for the 5-6 player expansion. I feel the expansions complicate the base game enough to make it less fun for newer players but don't add enough to make it much more fun for experienced players.

RATING: 9
This game kind of got old, but it still works. There are no other game that does things this game does. Getting the income based on where you are and trading and all that just goes so well together. There is a minor take that element, but if people use it wisely, not just for revenge, it's a integral element of the game as the catch up mechanism and even though I usually hate this kind of stuff, it's not a big deal here, and it's so fast it doesn't really hurt. This and the hand limit is a constant pressure to use your resources as soon as you can which is great to keep the game just going fast and smooth.

As is the case for many folks, this was the first Eurogame that I played. I quite enjoyed it, and I'll still gladly play it. However, it rarely gets to the table due to its strict player count (ONLY 3 or 4) and the fact that I've simply discovered several other games that I enjoy more.

Definitely plan to keep it around as a gateway game, though.

Catan receives way too much hate these days. On the surface there's loads of luck involved in gathering resources, but this is part of risk management in this game. Without randomness and unequal distribution of resources players would have no incentive to negotiate and trade. That player interaction and convesations around the table are the very things that make playing Catan an enjoyable experience. And although there are tons of better games around, Catan still holds up pretty well after all these years. You just need to play with an easy-going group of friends who are willing to actively participate in negotiations. I had fun playing this game and would gladly revisit it some time in the future.

I like the trading aspect, so that's why I bought Bohnanza.  It served well as a jumping-off point to other Euros, but I prefer not to play it now -- and especially so if it's not a 3-player game.

I've decided what I like about this game the most is that most everyone knows how to play, so I do not have to explain the rules.  Nice!

A bit on the random side,  but its thematic,  you get to build and trade,  and its reasonably quick.  These days,  I feel it runs a bit long - playtime is unpredictable depending on how people get set up ( and bad choices at the beginning are tough to mitigate,  and it's possible to be completely locked out).

good for play for social interaction. The luck factor in placement of the tiles, the die rolls for production, all too much dictate the outcome of any one given game. A decent strategy can even out potential imbalances of that sort, but it's by no means even handed as the game plays out.

Reglas muy sencillas, adictivo, rejugable y con muchas posibilidades. Su parte de azar lo hace muy interesante y tiene mucha interacción entre jugadores. Estrategia y recursos.

Es la mejor expansión, dándole un giro completo al juego, haciéndolo más táctico, complejo y avanzado. Mejora el juego notablemente. Con fundas tamaño mini-eurogame 44x67mm.

Hm.  Love/hate with this game.  It is a great gateway game and I will give it credit for that.  I do believe it is a skill game and not just luck based.  True, sometimes the dice are not in your favor and you will go down.  But in the long run the better player will triumph.  You may see some people here on the Geek really bashing this game calling it outdated, and there may be some truth to that.  But the game is enjoyable for many people, it is a great start for getting your friends into gaming who have only played Monopoly and Clue, and it can be played with a wide array of gamer-types.  All that said, I hope I never have to play this game again.

OK, I finally played my first game of Settlers. It was the 2 player variant where you play to 15 and roll the resource dice twice. Anyway, I liked it a lot. We'll definitely play again.

My only problem with the game so far is that I am red/green color deficient. So all those reds and browns and greens are a little rough to tell apart. Although there is some detail on the cards it's not high contrast so it doesn't help much. Also - it would help if there were pictures on each tile of the resource that the tile produces. It was hard for me to just look at a tile and know what resource was associated with it. I had to keep looking at the resource cards and then try to figure out which background matched the tile. Ugh.

Solid Game. 

Always a great "gateway" game to get people past monopoly.  

It has done wonders for the board game industry.  

At this point I've played over 100 matches, and while I'm done with it, there is a lasting fondness for it in my heart.

Yeah, there are better games.  But let's be thrilled about it for what it is.

Favorite Expansions:
* Old Fisherman of Catan (impossible to find)
* Cities and Knights (very complex though)
* Event Deck (out of print and thus more expensive than it's worth)

Fast-paced and a nice collection of mechanics that fit together well.

This was my first hobby game, and it really drew me into board gaming. I have not played the game in a while, but I still enjoy the game. It is quick to learn, quick to play, and keeps all of the players involved. If there is any downside it is that the theme is a little dull. In the game you collect and trade resources with other players in order to build new cities. Resources are produced through dice Roll and traded on each players turn. 3/1/16

Considered along with Puerto Rico to be one of the classics.  Overall I like the theme and the approach to the game, the only thing that drives me crazy are the dice.  Despite long term probability the dice in settlers seem to enjoy tormenting players, (myself at times especially) which seems to take the game from having strategy to mainly having luck which I don't like.  I certainly like having a random element in games, I just think in settlers the dice have more influence than they should.

This is the game that opened my eyes to the world of euro boardgames, so it will always have a special place in my heart.  Also, my wife bought me a 3rd edition copy when we were dating, and I will probably always keep that.  I have many fond memories of playing this with a bunch of guys into the wee hours of the morning when I was in college, and in that sense it's a great game.  But for me, I hate the dice, I hate the robber, and I hate the play time.  I'll quickly suggest a different game any time someone wants to play this.

This is the classic eurogame and is still a great player experience, despite its randomness.
This game often causes tension within our gaming group as it is brilliantly designed to make the player feel that he is always only one turn from victory. This can really crank up the atmosphere.We always come back though because this is such a good game. 
I would be interested to try it with the cards replacing the dice, to stop the three 12s in a row syndrome.

This game basically got me into modern board gaming.  Once I started playing, I couldn't stop.  It's simple and addictive.  However, after having gotten into board games and having played many others, Catan doesn't quite hold up.  First off, there's too much luck involved.  This can overcome with good building placement, but there are some games where 6 or 8 (the numbers that should come up more often when rolling 2 die) just never come up but 3s or 10s come up over and over again, rewarding the lucky player who just happened to chose those resource hexes with an easy victory.  Bottom line is: if your numbers aren't rolled, you lose.  And the game gets very frustrating and/or boring when you're hopelessly losing since the better you're doing, the easier it is to do even better.

I recommend new gamers give this a try.  It's fun and will get you into gaming.  Then, to add some complexity and replay value, get some of the expansions.  The Cities & Knights expansion makes the game great by adding the needed complexity.  Explorers & Pirates is also really fun, though it basically makes it into a different game. I've never been a big fan of Seafarers, it doesn't really add a whole lot in my opinion like the other expansions do.  Traders & Barbarians, in my opinion, is the best at fixing the original game without changing too much.  Some of the additions (especially fish and the cards instead of dice additions) really make the game less about luck and more about strategy.  

Catan is not my favorite game, but I keep comping back to it.  It holds a special place in my heart I guess.  It's worth playing for sure.

Also have 5-6 player's expansion.
Players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine the current production on the island. Players collect raw materials to build up their civilizations to gain enough victory points to win the game.

I find myself neglecting Catan in favour of newer and more shiny games, but it really is a classic.  It's not that it's the best game or my favourite game, but (along with Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride) it feels a bit like the Monopoly or Risk of the modern generation of games.  It's got a fair bit of luck, but also a fair bit of choice - it's not a 'heavy' game that will go on for hours, but you do have a sense of building something and your island will look differently at the end (and start) of each game.  It's a good solid game.

More recently received. Opened and walked through with only 2 of us, just to get the feel of it. Tried with all 4 of us (2 adults & 2 kids). Maybe we don't get this game, but it dragged on and it wasn't much fun after a while. Then I tried some online downloads/variants and had more fun playing with the computer. Not sure how it got this popular or if/when we'll try again at home, but since we rarely have 3 willing, I'm aiming to run a PC version here my wife and I can play against a 3rd computer opponent.

HET spel dat het bordspel weer op de kaart zette.

Spelers zijn kolonisten op het eiland Catan en bouwen daar aan dorpen en wegen om het eiland te bevolken. De speler die dit het snelste doet wint uiteindelijk het spel.

Ook al is het spel erg populair, ik kan de charme niet ontdekken. Het dobbelen zorgt wat mij betreft voor veel geluk en dan kun je nog zo goed spelen, je spel kan er door overhoop worden gehaald.

About as elegant as a game can get.  Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and the games that have copied this one in some way are almost countless.  It has since been surpassed by some games (Puerto Rico and Agricola for starters) - or perhaps it hasn't been surpassed but only seems so because of its age.  Definitely a classic of classics.

The one major problem (for some) is the randomness, where unlucky dice rolls can ruin the best strategy.

Good solid basic game, family friendly (my 8 and 9 year olds handle it easily). IMHO it is better to stick with the predetermined set-up, as it is more balanced.

UPDATE: Actually it gets quite a lot of play as my wife and my brother g/f do enjoy it a lot. 

UPDATE AND NOTE: I downgraded the rating as now I am only willing to play it with new people. With seasoned bordgamers I will not play it anymore (if given a choice)

This is my all-time favourite game, and one that I am glad to see gets played regularly at club.

RATING: 5.5
I was obsessed with this game when I first got into the hobby. I played it every week even though my friends and I all ended up hating each other after most games. I do not play this game anymore. There is too much luck of the dice and turns where nothing happens for you. Roll the dice and if your number doesn't come up and no one to trade with you your turn is over. Also, this game suffers from everyone ganging up on the person in the lead and makes the game drag out way longer than necessary.

Being such a talked about game I expected to have more fun playing it but I got bored quickly. I hate the randomness of the dice and I have the screw you factor of the thief. I do, however, love saying 'I have wood for sheep.' and pointing out the racism in the robber being black.

This a favorite for many players. It is really fun and pretty simple to play and teach. One element that I dislike is the random dice. The dice control what resources show up.

The very first "gamer's game" I ever played. I enjoyed it quite a bit until I played a game where I was pigeon-holed throughout the entire 2-hour ordeal. Though it was my own fault, certainly, it completely ruined the experience for me and I doubt I will be playing Catan in the next several years unless forced.

Even though I'd played Settlers with SF and the C & K expansion before, this was my first time playing vanilla Settlers. I got whupped good - the scores were 5,9,10, with me at the 5. Nonetheless, I had a good time and it's easy to see why this game is so heralded. I'm not sure this would ever rise above a 9 for me but it will always be an enjoyable way to spend an hour.

RATING: 7
Simple game with lots of randomness in setup. So, there could be completely different tactic every game. Was going to rate it 9, but after finding out that settlements must to be built adjacent to your roads and playing with correct rules it has dropped a lot. Game drags and it's hard to expand and create interesting tactics. First setup becomes the main strategy. Thinking to play it more with house rule (without roads requirement).

A great example of the differences between skill with controlling randomness and luck with trusting to randomness.  (A skill relying player will almost always beat a luck relying player.) The trick is not to always go for the best odds (as a 2d6 curve is rather flat), but to understand why lesser odds may be a better build (to spread numbers for instance).

I grew up with this game. Settlers replaced Skat(!) in our local pub as the game you could play every evening – there were always players coming to the pub wanting to play Settlers and the pub soon purchased a game so nobody had to bring his own. I was still a little kid accompanying my parents, later it was the favourite boardgame to play with friends for many years.

Two aspects of the game that stand out for me: random drawing of the whole island and the trading aspect. The trading is the core of the game – you roll the dice to earn resources that you can trade. And you can trade everything: three corn make one beer, three sheep to drive me home tonight. Again, this is meant to be a social/pub game as the players do not play just for themselves against each other. As for the random aspect, this game is so customizable. You could use the 6 player expansion or just a second base game to build a bigger map and/or play up to 15 or even 20 points. You can also make one or two resources very scarce or even non-existent. Endless variations.

One bad thing about the game is that it can be boring or frustrating if there are players of different levels as the random aspect is not as big as in, say, Monopoly. Settlers is quite easy to learn (as for the rules of the game) but better players play much faster and know what things to do in certain situations. Peacefully developing your stuff turns into hecticly buying basically everything you can get. So this may be one aspect Settlers share with Skat – you might play it with players at the same level as you are slowly getting better at it. In my opinion, this game is mainly made for three players. So again – sort of a Skat replacing board game... Just be sure to get the old edition with wooden parts and cleaner artwork or even the anniversary wooden box. The newer edition with plastic parts is just ugly.

Solid game. It is everything people claim it to be. I find there are other games I would rather play. I think there are two main issues for me. First it is either too much or too little engine building depending on whether you are looking for a filler or a middleweight loger game. Second especially in the early game there is not always much to do. I am just not on the edge of my seat playing this. This may need to go down to a 6.

The impact of this game and past addiction must count for something. Sure there are plenty of games now I would rather play, but few have ever captured my attention like Settlers, when I first played it back in '96. When I first played it, it was the best boardgame I'd ever played, and though others have surpassed it, the first impression will never change.

Pretty much every game I play is this:

RATING: 8
Probably not much more can be said about this game, but it's historically probably one of the most played games in my collection with a variety of groups. Nowadays I play games mostly with family, and this is one of our standards. I probably would not choose it as often as we play it, but it has stood the test of time and is still an entertaining enough game that I don't mind playing it when other people make the request. 

The variable game board and luck of the dice rolls make each game different enough to avoid to much same-ness from game to game. Good for just about everyone, but probably less enjoyed by those who dislike lucky swings in games as it relies heavily on the aforementioned dice rolls. There is some room for strategy in what spaces you choose at the start and where you decide to build, but really the success of those choices is relegated to the dice. That doesn't bother me as I like a little luck shakedown in my games (probably because pure strategy isn't my strong point!)

I was really into this game until I grew tired of it. A lot of fun for me is dependent on the group I'm playing with an their willingness to trade goods. I've played games where no-one was willing to trade among the players, and I disliked those plays severely.

Another thing I've gone to dislike about the game, is that when playing with more than 2 people, 2 people can band together to try and 'wall in' a village of the third person, very likely putting that player at such a disadvantage that he/she can no longer play a competitive role in the game and has to basically wait out the game while 'giving' away goods to the remaining players.

I give it a 10, not because it is the best game ever, but because for what it is, it's basically perfect.  The key is not expecting more from it than what it is -- a light, luck-based social game.

I will play it, but never really care much for it. I find it kind of tedious, and it seems to play out the same every time. My main dislike for it is how important getting the die rolls is. If you don't get the rolls you need, especially early in the game, you are just there to watch. Also, if you don't get the dice rolls you don't even get to play. This game turned me off "european style" games for years.

RATING: 5
A decent game for its time, but suffers from a few flaws which will likely keep me away.  First, while it seems that the luck factor is low, luck actually ends up having much too large an impact on the game.  The fact that there really aren't THAT many die rolls means that being on the losing end of too many of them pretty much kills you no matter how good your strategy.  Also, it is far too easy to stifle a player using the robber, and luck plays in to this, too.  If you don't like this type of screw-your neighbor, you will really dislike Settlers, because it can be nasty.  The robber is really the only mechanism to haul in a runaway leader, other than a "stay close" strategy, so it suffers badly for that as well.  Negotiation plays a big role, except that negotiation is often worthless, as everyone can very plainly see what you are after.  Could maybe use a little hidden information.  Just doesn't quite do it for me, but might play on occasion if it is strongly desired by others.

Absolute classic that is still fun sometimes but can get very frustrating if the dice do not roll in your favour. Sure there's trading but sometimes that doesn't work either and you just sit there unable to do anything.

RATING: 7
Great game! Very easy to learn and pick up. Strategic nonetheless! Settlers of Catan was my gateway game.

The only reason why I don't want to give it a 10 is because it's pretty easy to tell who is going to win the game about 7 or so rounds in. You can snowball very easily in this game, however the incorporation of the crippling "7" roll can definitely balance things about. Plus, development cards can become VERY useful, depending on the timing.

What's nice is there is some variability from game to game. You will never have the same game twice. Replay-ability is definitely HIGH.

I would give this game a 9 if there were some way to buy resources from other players, much like in 7 Wonders. I don't want to talk too much about the mechanics, but you get the point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Huh, What comment can I make about Settlers? I don't want to say I like it, I feel so torn about it. There are way better games now, but this game is still good for what it is. Settlers feels like an awkward High School Romance that just sorta faded away, never had an explosive/dramatic break-up, You both know its over but it doesn't stop you from wondering if there [i]wasn't something there.[/i]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
Great entry game, but too much relying on dice.  Adding a 'charity deck' that follows the same rule as the starfarers' charity rule is a must for us now.  It makes the game much more enjoyable for all.

For an enjoyable 2 player game, implement the charity rule, and throw seafarers & knights in; make a big map with lotsa islands, then use two colors of peices each & set the winning points at 20 to 24.

Replayability is moderate and the game is somewhat luck driven. Player interaction is high. It is unfortunate that it cannot play with 2 players though.

The last player to place settlements seem to enjoy a distinct advantage due to the ability to place both settlements and roads without fear of being blocked while blocking others.

I used to rate this a 7, and I do still enjoy it, but after having seen (and been) someone hammered down due to bad-roll after bad-roll, over a lengthy game, I do feel that the luck element is a little too heavy (and illogical - I can understand dice-rolls for, say, combat, but it seems odd that an island can only produce a certain few yields a year, of seemingly random produce). I appreciate the part it plays, but it takes me out of the game.

Still, a very solid game. Interesting mechanics, an attractive board, and with engaged players an excellent game. A high 7.

One of the games that sparked the Renaissance of board gaming. Friends would come to the table to play Catan. A nice, easy game to learn with a simple elegance to it.

This was the first game I played of the more modern games. It led me from the world of Risk, Monopoly, Clue, Life, and other classic games to a whole new world. The map is random and changes each time you play it. Build roads to expand your influence and built more towns. The dice determine the game play but there is some strategy involved. Trade with other players but be careful not to have too many resources or you may have to give some up if someone rolls a 7. Focus on getting the longest road or building the largest army. Winner is the first person to 10 points. Great 1.5 hour to 2 hour game for beginners. Seasoned players may take 1 to 1.5 hours. Played well with 3-6 players.

Very addicting, but I still maintain that the game rely too much on luck (the roll of the dice) and not enough strategy involved besides the initial placement of your settlements and roads.

Whilst I enjoy the variety of ways to acquire cards - through dice rolls, trading and the robber - I have a couple of niggles elsewhere in the game. I get the feeling that if you fall behind you can't catch up. Somebody with five houses is going to always be getting more resources than you. Also, the game tends to drag out a bit long with no clear finish in sight.

Very good, light game. Highly luck based and has a big bash-the-leader problem, but it's satisfying and fun. Expansions feel tacked on and unnecessary.

RATING: 6.3
The modular board and the collecting resources on other players turns is very innovative and trading is done well in Catan. Hwever, it's too easy to fall behind though if your numbers don't roll well and strategic decisions are limited after the initial placing of towns.

RATING: 6
This game depends heavily on gambling on die probability distributions.  Nonetheless, there is something appealing about it.  The configurability of the game is probably its strongest trait.  My main problem with it is that after a certain point in the game, I really don't care what happens most turns, because I can't do anything - especially if I'm on the verge of winning.  (And you'd think that's because people won't trade with me, but oddly, the problem is just that the other people take exponentially longer, the closer someone is to winning.

Quick to learn simple game.  Not much going on with it and just the right amount of luck to have things turn around or give someone who isn't as good a chance.  My biggest complaint would be the opening setup is far more important than the rest of the game.  Could use some balance making later decisions mean a little more so a bad start doesn't need to rely to much on luck to claw your way back.  Games go quick enough though when that does happen to fix your mistakes in the next game.  Overall a great game that most people will enjoy.

This is the game that got me back into board games after a ten-year hiatus.  I can't say a bad word against it.  People tend to overstate the extent to which luck is involved, and it has become fashionable to bash it, while conveniently ignoring that (a) it came long before many of the supposedly superior games and (b) is THE game that made North Americans hope for and expect something better than Risk.

This game was more or less the first Eurogame I played.  It's a nice game, but no matter how many people talk it up and say how great it is, I cannot escape the fact that every turn is decided by a roll of the dice.  I've seen people occupy every number except for the 3, 4 and 8 and watch 7-8 turns pass before being able to get a resource.  It's a little too random for me, and admittedly I burned myself out on it.

You never forget your first, but you do normally move on to greener pastures.

It's a classic for a reason. Probably most people's introduction to real games, and it's still cute when a friend will tell me, "I've played this game, you might not have heard of it... it's called Settlers of Catan".
Aww.
It's done a great service by introducing more people to our hobby, but I think that the randomness (HOW CAN 2 BE ROLLED FOUR CONSECUTIVE TURNS?!) limits its ability to be higher. The lack of catch-up makes the end game fairly predictable, and the negotiations are pretty simple. But still, if someone is excited about it I'll happily play, but only as a vehicle to open them up to more exciting games.

Although this is the game that got me interested in boardgames, I never have an urge to play it anymore. The problems include:
1. Lots of downtime
2. A whole bunch of dice randomness, which leads to
3. Some players doing well early, building stuff and getting more stuff while other players are screwed, having to sit at the table for an hour and a half taking joy in how well others are doing. In all the games I've played, at least one of the players has been out of contention very quickly.

Of the "Holy Trinity" (Settlers, Ticket to Ride, Carcassone), this is easily my least favorite. It's just so fiddly compared to the others. The rules aren't super simple. And it's the only one that uses dice as a major mechanism. Don't get me wrong, I'll play the game, and I understand its elegance -- especially at the beginning wave of modern board games, but... I'll go elsewhere.

Classic and restarted me buying boardgames, yet overhyped. You need too much luck with the dices. But what I really dislike about the game is the non stop-trading of your goods. It's no real fun.

Fun game but it can take a lot more time than expected. And with longer games, I've had some not-so-serious people lose interest in the game.

In my opinion this is a retheming of Monopoly with slight improvements. You are still determining resource generation randomly with dice rolls, though it is now tied to a bell curve rather than moving around a track. Then the main part of the game centers around negotiating and trading with other players to get what you need to improve your board position. It's a baby step away from main stream games into designer games.

Who hasn't heard of this game? Anyway, I blame [url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/17-04/mf_settlers]Wired Magazine[/url] for introducing me to this and other modern boardgames. While I do not consider it to be the most elegant of games, I do recognize how it changed the gaming landscape. It introduces players to basic euro mechanics after all. The only time I feel that strategy is involved is during initial settlement placement. It's all somewhat random and dependent on other factors afterwards. Fortunately since its inception Klaus Teuber has released countless expansions that add replay value.

12/18/08 - It took me a *long* time to warm up to this game.  I guess I was just too daft to understand it before.  Now that I'm enlightened, I guess there really isn't much more to say about it that hasn't already been said (by its advocates).  I will say, however, that comments that this game is random reek of more ignorance than just about any other stereotypical BGG comment.  I guess this is yet another example of a game whose ultimate pay-off has turned out to be inversely proportional to my original dislike of the game (Ra, Dune, Antiquity being a few others).

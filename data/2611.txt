Nice and funky art, sick theme. The gameplay is uninteresting with some obvious decisions and a boring repetitive battle system. The rich get richer until an overpowered action card resets the balance of power.

I made most of the stuff in the game that folks comment upon here. Thanks for all your nice comments. An the other ones as well. Moritz, if there is a designer's Hell I'll do my best to inform you!

After one year I still think this is a very fun game to play - though it is not  perfect (nor are the components made out of human skin & pig iron the way we would have liked it) - and it still surprises the daylights out of me. If you like sprawling games with a lot of options and surreal artwork: this is still your game.

Original game. My remarks are the flimsy component, unbalance from an unlucky demon draw and sometime the excessive game 
lenght

RATING: 6.66
Sort of war game type. Control areas with dice rolls and card play. Cards have great art. Based in part on famous literature: Dante's Inferno.

Fight mechanic kinda flawed. Some have offered a band-aid or changing the roll of a 6 for a hit to a 5 or 4. Seems like that shouldn't be passed up.

Also, too bad the board wasn't a bit sturdier. And the box. But especially the board. Or maybe just the box...
? I wonder if I can get one of those game craft Co.s to print this board out onto a traditional boardgame board for me?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The most chaotic game I know. But if you are able to roll with the punches and laugh when the bad luck hits (and it will) this is an extremely strongly themed game with great player interaction. It has politics, combat and more. With the right people, this game rocks!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.66
An odd mixture of strategy and dicey chaos factor dripping with flavor. The artwork/chrome is haunting and incredibly immersive. The pervasive uncertainty factor built into every aspect of the game makes for a high frustration factor. A random card draw or dice roll can give one an overly-powerful edge or completely ruin your plans.The overall game mechanic is a bit clunky, but it captures the essence of what it intended to do.

RATING: 5
Based on the impressions after two completed games. I believe this games plays you and not the other way around. There is simply to much random involved for my taste.

RATING: 7
Aunque el reglamento pone que es hasta para 6 jugadores, no conviene pasar de 4. Cada jugador controla un triumvirato de demonios. El objetivo es conseguir controlar una corona circular del tablero del infierno, dividida en cinco sectores. Tiene muchas cartas y es muy dependiente del idioma. Hasta donde yo se, solo lo hay en inglés. 

Puede ser algo caótico, pero está bastante bien.

RATING: 7.5
Rating basd on one play at BGG.CON '08 (3 players).  Liked it much better than I expected to!  Definitely chaotic, but played more quickly than anticpated.  I don't think I'd want to play with more than 3 (or possibly 4).  It sounds like the expansion for this is pretty much mandatory, so that goes on my must-buy list.

One concern I had before playing was that some of the cards are over-the-top grotesque (like the gluttony card), and I didn't want to spend the entire game having my stomach turned.  Luckily, these cards are only used during setup, so that was not a factor.  The cards used during the game are much more restrained.

Sold on Ebay in the ongoing purge of multiplayer games.

Played this with bad players who just made defensive alliances and refused to attack.  Probably not the game's fault that it dragged and stalled.  Would like to try it again with better people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A wicked little game if there ever was one.  Rules are witty and have a Monty Python feel to them.  Power politics at its best.  Pull a double-cross and say "The Devil made me do it!"  A bad draw of demons can put a player at a disadvantage at start, but if so, relax and just have a little diabolical fun.  Display the box prominently on your shelf to scare your Baptist neighbors!

Edit: 2-12 Rating slightly lowered.

Wow, too much to track all at one time, but I have a biased opinion against this because I don't care for wargames, especially those with pages and pages and pages of rules. Still, I give the designers credit for some innovations here... the concept of circular regions of Hell for warfare, demon ability to move back and forth from Earth, etc.

2015-08-10 : I had been going to Spiel in Essen every year from 2004 onwards as a representative of Matrix Games, working from the UGG booth. Udo and the gang there are and were wargamers, but there was a guy on the demo-team who just had his first non-wargame design published : Anders Fager from Sweden - a guy who could and would discuss everything : from tactics in the Napoleonic era to how to interpret Dante. He taught me his game : The Hell Game - one of the most fascinating games every made - when you play it you just know the guy who made it must be brilliant. And he is.

But he's also very fun to be around and we spend many nights drinking, discussing and fixing the world's problems in many a pub in Essen. The other guy in our pub-triumvirate was Marc von Martial (or Schwanebeck as he was known back then) and once we ran up a tab of 39 half-liter beers between the 3 of us ... we pulled an all-nighter, but still ... the next morning at the fair I felt like hell. Anders looked like he had had 10 hours of sleep and was so cheery we could have strangled him 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really wanted to like this game: The cards are wonderfully designed, the rules are well laid out and make sense, the theme is great, as is the research....but the result is an unplayable luckfest that is very little fun as anything you try to do is heavily dependent on luck, so following ANY strategy is pretty futile. I only rate it a 5 because I think the game is so weird that it is somehow unique, but for fantasy wargames (which this basically is) you have MUCH better options. And random games like this shouldn't take that long to explain or last forever - my gaming group simply gave up on this after hours of useless dice-rolling...even the tiniest combat could simply take forever!
You can see: I'm very sad that this game ain't better! Is there a hell for game designers?

RATING: 6
Only played one game.  We got horrible world events that really kept *everyone* from gaining favors (to "buy" areas to win) and kept us from doing any real battle (to take over areas to win).  The game was frustrating and a major uphill battle, but given different circumstances, I think it could of been really fun.  I think I'd try it again.

RATING: 7
Great amount of research went into this game.  Beautiful (vile?) artwork fitting the theme.  That said, the components are very cheap for a very expensive game(I know this is a limited production thus costs had to be kept low but still...)  Rules can be a headache, but I&#039;ve only played once and we tried to learn the game as we went (instead someone should have &quot;studied&quot; the rulebook completely before play).  Some of the cards are way too random and can be devastating if your troops are in the wrong sectio or quarter.  Complaints aside, with the right crowd, this could be really fun as long as the game moved along at a good pace.

Recently acquired. It's a rather good game. The playbility is interesting, altought, it has to improve some of the rules. SOmetimes, the randomess may disturb the competivity of the game, making it too hard for one player. Another great issue of this game, is the board, printed on plain paper, what makes it kind of fragile. It would be nice if it was printed on hard cartboard, or even some kind of fabric.

Other than that, the artwork is truly amazing, and the overall quality of the cards is likewise great.

Overall, it's a good game, especially when you play with lots of players. It also resembles Risk sometimes, but it's funnier and faster, althought, if you HATE Risk and alike, I would advise to playtest before you buy it.

This game will really reach its pinnacle (or depth, as the case may be) with a group that is willing to negotiate and connive a la Diplomacy. The combat system could still use a little work, but the plethora of options in every turn is so huge that it borders on the confusing... which is a good thing, IMO.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2013)

What a surprising novel game. The Hell Game oozes theme and that´s great, one of the more thematic games I ever played, however the game components leave much to be desired. The game board is flimsy paper and the chits are small and of low quality. The black tokens are hard to see in contrast with the game board. The art of the game is truly EXCELLENT (although it can offend some people). The flavor text on the cards is pretty well researched. Neat :D.

It has lots of negotiation and backstabbing and room for tactical play, however you can´t plan far ahead as pure chaos will bring down your carefully laid plans.

The gameplay is very good, it is a control area game with some twists. However I don’t like that it has so much luck. For me a game this complex and involved (you can play for hours) should not be decided by where Lilith and/or Uriel moved. It has a lot of uncontrollable chaos and that is my main complaint so I’m rating it a 6.(66) but it has the potential to go higher in my ratings.

The game can be very fun to play and I WANT to play it again. I also feel the urge to buy this as it has a great theme.

I was loving the game... until Lilith and Uriel brought to an already chaotic game, the ultimate chaos gaming experience. I really would like to think that we were playing something wrong...Waiting for my second game.
2009/01/06: I played it for the second time. The game managed to get to its end and we all were happy. This game is some hidden gem under tons of trashy games. Perhaps you could get a while before you reach it, but when you do it, it starts shinning right in your hands. Even though it's a chaotic game, it's an awesome one. Also, this game it's the more thematic I've ever played, and also the more fiddly, but I'm in love with this one!

RATING: 4
The positive first: This game has a unique theme and some excellent research was done in preparing it. Whoever designed it had a very clear understanding of the subject matter.

But, the components are very cheap and the gameplay is a confusing, drawn out mess.  It is incredibly random and it is shocking how powerful some of the special events are and how much time it takes to handle them. The circular gameboard is supposed to be unique and the rules say that you should use its unusual shape to fool people, but in reality it gives you a headache to look at long term. 

And as has been said this game is not cheap costing $60 a pop.... of course this is a low production game but as a consumer you have to look at what else is available. For $60 a paper board doesn&#039;t cut it. Just one spill and it is all over.

Played once in six. This game looks amazing! But when you start playing you feel like the Hell is growing in your head with its chaos! You play following the random events, reading many cards and waiting for your destiny to come. The design is wonderfull, but usually when the energy is pointed to improve beauty, the mechanics lacks. Ok, if you like to live a game experience with an evil background probably you will like it, anyway for me is too much large for being digested and its complexity in proceeding it doesn't play to its favor.

An exciting, dynamic, multi-player game. With lots of different strategy options. Moderately complex. Lots of dirty tricks and diplomacy. Unfortunally the combat system is too slow occasionally and replayability might be an issue. PS. More than four players tend to make the game too slow.

The combat system is tremendously bad, but for flavor there's little to rival this.  I adore the production (if only there was a mounted map!) and one really does feel as though you are waging ritualized warfare across brutal and unstable realms.

Hard to describe this game. I suppose it is like a very vauge mutation between an area control game and a card driven wargame, except with more chaos and a theme of Hell.

RATING: N/A
I played this once and I can hardly vouch for the gameplay as a whole, however I found the manual to be very spotty and difficult to learn from. It seemed to me to have promise, once you understood it, but I doubt I'll ever be able to convince anyone I know to try it again after the first ordeal.

RATING: 6
The closest rival I've seen to El Grande in the area majority arena. The calculation here is more obtuse being a potential of votes based on resident cubes of a region which adds an interesting bluff and deal making component that I don't really see in El Grande (bluffing some with the tower, but no real deal making, it's implicit there while explicit here). I can see where a run-away leader can become a problem if people don't actively work together. That later part is the clutch issue and creates one of the more interesting pacing instances I've seen in a while. over 4 years, falling behind and surging ahead isn't bad necessarily.

I wonder how powerful Deputy is, in one election cycle I raised 8 influence markers and due to cutting a deal to keep the current mayor in, retained it for the second cycle (again, raising over 6)... Second thing that comes to mind is how well one could both front load cubes in the water front and then also dump a bunch in one of the last districts to score (in order to entice people to join in, and thus keep them honest on earlier deals). Last, is the left/right seat binding with mayor and the final turn before each election important or no? Is it better or worse than the "bid low, go first" cadence in El Grande? Tentative strong 6, low 7 score depending on the group (as most negotiations are).

RATING: 7.5
A very strategic and tactical area control game.  Definitely a bash-the-leader mechanic.  It can be difficult to "read" the board state, so it is subject to poor player decisions handing the game to someone.

RATING: 8
A pretty nasty collusion and temporary alliance building game where the players must form a coalition against the incumbent and attack him at every opportunity or face certain defeat, which sets up nice opportunities for king making, back stabbing, downright fabrication and general ruthlessness. Feels slightly like a shorter but more comical session of Diplomacy - you play the opponents and their intentions more so than the board itself. Since the mechanics are so simple it seems more like a social experiment than a board game. A lot of fun with the right crowd.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#FF9933][b]aaj's FAVORITE AREA CONTROL[/b][/BGCOLOR][/COLOR]
[I]tl;dr - If you want [/I]mean[I] area control, Tammany Hall is the game for you. This exercise in heartless maneuvering and backstabbing is exhausting, but well worth the effort.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

I bought Tammany Hall on October 30, 2016, little anticipating the Halloween nightmare that this game would prove to be. It sat on my shelf, brooding as only a fat cat New York City mob boss can do, daring me to test myself against it, only to break against the uncaring sand and retreat, as the waves do day after day after day. Finally I could stand it no longer, as I threw down my gauntlet, gathered my friends, and resolved to test our wills and our friendships on this knife fight. 

Reviewers described Tammany Hall as 'competitive' and 'backstabbing' -- I pictured your typical Sheriff of Nottingham game, or even a competitive push-your-luck game like Deep Sea Adventure. I was in no way prepared for the convulsions of nervousness and fear that would overtake me when playing this game. Calling this game 'competitive' is like calling a tigress an 'overgrown kitty cat.' This is, bar none, absolutely the most competitive game I have ever owned or played. 

I enjoyed playing the game and would tentatively rate it a high 6 or even a low 8. More plays will determine that. I also agree with Jon that it's a great game, but far too stressful to see the table every week. At the same time, there's nothing that really does what Tammany Hall does, and if you want some good area control, it's hard to find a more satisfying game than this. I'm eager to see how it plays with fewer players and with proper turn order, and I think I will be keeping it in my collection.

Further plays have continued to smooth out the wrinkles and this remains the most aggressive game in my collection. I think the theme just brings it out of everyone -- you really feel like a reckless mob boss who's out to win districts by hook or by crook. I'm looking forward to more plays of this one.

I enjoy area control games, specially the euroish style of area control games and Tammany Hall is a very unique piece in this category. This is enough just to win some rating, sum that to a very great and beautifully designed game, you have Tammany Hall.

In this game we control chiefs of influence all over New York and spread our influence over the immigrants from 4 nations that come to live in New York.

It is a great game with a good artwork.

A very good mid weight area control token placement game. The game plays well with 5 players. Lots of interaction and really fun on the whole.

Components are top notch and the map is really beautiful.

One thought: the last person to go in a round, seem to have certain advantage if all else are reasonably equal. More pays to find out.

Good overall game.

Impressively deep & minimalistic 'area influence' game. The mayor/office abilities offer neat twists on the gameplay, especially how he/she who gets the bonus mayor points has to hand out a unique gun to each of their opponents while they get squat for the next round. 

However, there is definitely a nerve wracking undercurrent in playing TH--the game forces you to be cutthroat. I like the tension but don't love the knife edge to it.

RATING: 8
A bare knuckle fight of an area control game.  Tammany Hall brings a good flavour of 19th Century New York politics, with players slandering each other and vying for the support of four different immigrant populations. A nice balancing element is that the player who wins the most wards in a once every four turns election becomes the mayor and must allocate jobs to all of his opponents.  The special powers of those jobs will then be used to whittle away at the mayor's on board position.

I really like Tammany Hall as a three-player game, but would avoid playing again with five as there is a bit too much down time.  The five player game also raises my one complaint with an otherwise very handsome second edition; the choice of brown and purple as player colours.

With a name like Tammany Hall, I shouldn't have been surprised by how confrontational it is.
But I was. And not in a good way.:-)

Four of us played.
At the start of the game, everyone was striving to be Mayor (5 points!).

By halfway through the game, everybody was bitching about how much it sucked to be mayor.
I said I'd be an unlikely candidate for future plays.(Actually, my choice of words might have been a bit more R-rated :-)
But, I'll probably try it one more time, with the right cast of characters....now that I (sort of) understand it.

Reminded me about why I don't play war games.

RATING: 6
On first play, this game really felt like a scantily clad, cube effects abstract.  

And this game has tons of blind bidding, a mechanic that in the final analysis, I simply do not like.  Yes, it produces surprises, and yes, it presents player prediction challenges, but it also produces infuriating swingy results that can flush the entire game session down the toilet for those on the losing end of the swingy results.  And I was not on the losing end of those swingy results; other players were. 

I did not particularly enjoy the experience, but I can see how this game does present some interesting challenges.  If you love cube placement/analysis games, with double cube majority and result sequencing considerations, you will probably like this game.  I actually like these things, but I tend to like them in certain streamlined, dare I say elegant, packages, like King of Siam, Dominant Species, and El Grande, and NOT like them in other packages, like Wongar, Quebec, and Tammany Hall.  

The game feels vicious to play, and it seems to incorporate incentives to keep knocking down players who are behind within the first 10 minutes of the game.  Not fun for such players for sure, who have little hope of ever escaping the next hour of being whipped and/or relegated to last place.

Kickstarted.

We played this once and it really didn't work for me.  I don't want to trade it yet because it feels at least partially the situation and experience of that one play.  I was locked in a pretty solid 3rd, with 4th spending a lot of time whining and complaining, only to repeatedly throw me under the bus before catapulting into a last-round win.

The way scoring has to be balanced and role-selection works are both very nice aspects to this one.  I think it would work better if your group is more diplomatic, but mine rarely seems to want to work that way, so maybe that's the failing point for this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great Game. The perfect game for my group of friends. Simple ideas and easy to learn. Decent Depth. Win by outwitting, bluffing, and backstabbing the other players. Tammany Hall can be a very social fun game with players who are comfortable with messing around with each other. Definitely more fun with everyone on an about equal skill level.
Easy Personal 10 for me. My group loves it and I love it. We'll be playing this game for a long time.

I think what makes this game played over and over with my group is that everyone feels like they can win next time. And that they only lost because of their own misplay. Or that they can outwit their opponents next time. It is similar to the draw that high strategy + high luck games have. Players who win believe it was all because of their strategy and players who lose feel they lost because of bad luck. In this case players can easily feel that a slight adjustment to their strategy or election bidding could have made them the winner instead.

Enjoy the theme, even if it didn't feel so immersive to me.  Hate the arrow layout on the boards, wish it touched all districts rather than being separated.  I misunderstood a couple of rules and made a couple of play errors, and found myself hilariously behind in the token curve.  Didn't think it had so much of a runaway leader issue as a can't-come-back issue, although I did end up with a respectable placement due to being left alone.  I think my opponents could and should have abused my position.  Anyway, I'd play it again.  Felt more El Grande than most area games to me, even though I can't say it has much specifically to do with it.

- Another bland area control that doesn't bring anything relevant. The bidding for the regions is chaotic and poorly designed and the other player's actions are mostly unpredictable.

Good game, but I'm not a fan of this genre.  It tends to degenerate into a backstabbing tit-for-tat game with my gaming group, and the victory goes to those who pissed off others the least.  This can be good, but is very predictable in the group that I play it with.  Because these are probably the only people that I'll be playing it with, and they already have copies,  I don't feel a need to own.

What I liked:
No dice, no cards...interesting in that way. It's all about token placement and strategy...

What I didn't like:
I'm not big on games that encourage "gang up" mechanics which this definitely does, if you're in the best shape everyone will try fuck you over, and if it's 3 on 1 it can be fairly crippling. That's a fine mechanic, just not my first choice in the games I prefer to play.
Also it seems there are definitely scenarios where you can mess up you first term so badly that it's unrecoverable, and you basically limp along crippled for the rest of the game. That wasn't me but I can't imagine it was much fun for that player.

First Play: I had owned this for over 2 years before I got to play. The rules seem abstract and at first it was hard to see how it all hung together. There is a penny drop moment when suddenly it all joins up and makes sense.

A very clever and quick game once you start, certainly faster than the 90 mins advised on the box. The interaction and attacks make for a very clever game although you will be ham strung if you get picked on.

A game where you need to jockey for position and not appear too strong. Playing optimally each round is not the best tactic against experienced players.

Massively underrated.   Every decision is tense and has huge ramifications now and later.  Every bit of this game oozes theme, and it’s a great one.  The game is probably not for everyone, but fantastic if you like more tactical games with great theme and interaction.  Locking down a ward to rig an election, after that well-timed double slander.  What’s not to like? 

Edit: Actually lowered my ranking a bit. Simply not fun with the wrong group. People really have to buy into the bash the leader aspect. Fragile.

Medium level area majority game with a very fitting historical political theme. Players place their own bosses and immigrants of four different nationalities on the board. The bosses provide influence while the immigrants provide favors in the different population groups. These favours could help you win the elections in a region, but only when the appropriate population group is present. Game can be pretty mean and there is a lot of tit for tat play. The slander, when timed right, can be very powerfull. The balancing mechanic that the winner of the elections has to give his oponents jobs which provide them with various powerfull abilities is clever and really makes you think twice about winning the elections. So timing becomes a major component in this cleverly designed game.

Tammany Hall was on my want to play list and I'm glad I've tried it.  It is a game of "backstabbing, corruption, temporary alliances, and taking power at all costs" as described.  It's also very much a game of kingmaking (which fits the bill).  Overall, it's just not really my favorite kind of game but I could play it once in a blue moon.

I thought the mechanics were really awesome, fun, and surprisingly simple in a great way. I might have enjoyed it more had I had a better grasp of it in the beginning rounds, but that's what first time plays are for. Hopefully I'll remember how to play it well enough the next time I try it. This is definitely one to keep an eye out for. I was really impressed with the amount of potential player interference.

Excelente juego de mayorías ambientado en el tema de la inmigración en Nueva York en el siglo xix. La ciudad está dividida en distritos. El que consiga tener la mayoría de jefes de barrio acaba siendo el alcalde y otorga una serie de cargos al resto de los jugadores, que les permiten hacer ciertas cosas.

Además, hay que controlar la mayoría en cada distrito para obtener un jefe de barrio y también hay que controlar la mayoría de seguidores de las distintas nacionalidades (irlandeses, ingleses, italianos y holandeses).

Está muy bien y tiene chicha. Muy recomendable.Lo probé en las CLBSK 2013 por sugerencia de Max y la verdad que fue un acierto. Eso sí, es dificil de conseguir. Es una edición muy corta.

Initial impression after 1 play but need to play more. I was not expecting much after unpacking as the components are pretty bland and there is truckload of rainbow fruitsalad cubes, meeples and chits that will quench the apettite of any cube hoarding junkie. Although it is worker placement, it does not play out like that or a conventional Euro. The experience was very thematic, dynamic, rich and refreshing. The game also scores due to the high player interaction. Extremely ruthless and nasty but you need to play it for what it is. Probably also best with serious gamers who are situationally aware, definitely not for the wives and girlfriends unless u want a relationship dealbreaker. I was far ahead on turn 1 being mayor but ended up last and being crushed but still enjoyed the game and this did not hinder my strong impressions. (12/3/15). Upgrading to a 10. Ok it has a few rough edges, but that's politics and actually works in its favour. A superb rich and deep ruthless game that captures the political feel perfectly. Dripping in theme. Strong player participation, decision making. It looks like a Euro but actually doesn't play like one which is a further compliment. Final update. Great game but main issue Ive realised is the kingmaking and being able to attack anyone because you can. The person who wins often is because they were attacked the least and therefore built up cubes, control and mayor posts. Call it more of a feature of this type of game as opposed to a direct criticism.

Excellent design.  Unlike other euros, this title does not try to do or be more than it should.

Outstanding game of raw negotiation.  The mechanics are simple, but they well simulate real life political give and take.  Does tend to suffer from kingmaking, as a player can be out of the running early on.  Bottom Line - more accessible than Die Macher; more interesting than El Grande.

A gut-wrenchingly stressful game that ruthlessly pits players against each other whether they like it or not. Woe to the early leader: you will be crushed by your opponents within three or four turns. In fact, the game seems designed to create seemingly unstoppable leaders so that everyone gangs up on them, only to put someone else in their place. You know, politics. Great game.

This is an elegant and lean design that is enjoyable, but it also feels a bit dated. It lacks drama in nearly all aspects except for the bidding. Beyond the bidding it's slightly dull and a bit boring. 

Not a big fan of the state of immigrant majority being open information and constantly modified by choice. This means continual counting of majorities when gaining free cubes to see what you should add and it slows the pace.

It comes down to the fact that I'd much rather play something like The Godfather: A New Don.

This is a very interesting area control game. Very simple to play but lots of things to think about that can be influenced by every play. May burn the brain of a few AP players. I doubt I'd play it often as the theme isn't the greatest but it works realy well for this game. 1 Play.

I played this as a courtesy after being taught Manhattan Project. It didn't take long to get into. It's basically an area control game but has a few aspects that scream the theme of the battles (sometimes physical) over political control of New York, similar to those seen in the movie Gangs of New York. I won this game, but I could have easily came in last and I would have still loved how it played out. There was some wheeling and dealing, and backstabbing, and outright outgunning people to get the most control of the different ethnic groups in New York. I was exhausted after the play, but oh so satisfied.

Only one play so far, but very impressed. Rating could go up. Evokes the theme of a bare-knuckle political fight perfectly. 

Update: After a 2nd play, I have to ding the rating a point. I love how thematic everything feels, I love the vicious interaction and the overall feel of the game. I think it's just a bit chaotic though. Where a game of El Grande feels controllable (barely), this seems very ill-suited to any kind of planning. The powerful political roles change the board massively from turn to turn. It's too similar to El Grande in that I think I would rather just play that (at least with 5). There are so many things I love about it though that I will certainly continue to play it. Maybe 5 is too many for this game. I've now played with 3 and 5. I really want to try again with 4.

One play at Origins with Nate from Pandasaurus teaching us: really took to it! Like that it has a solid Euro base to the design, but there's a human interface with the negotiable influence allocation and chance to bluff. We didn't pursue that wheeling and dealing social aspect of game when I played because we were all beginners and we didn't know each other, but I can see that adding a non-calculable and balancing element to the game is something I may grow to appreciate. Solid '8' for now, room for improvement.

RATING: 8
*8* (Initial plays)
A real aggressive game with lots of backstabbing and interaction. I can see some people not liking this because players decisions effect everyone and so much of the game. It's kind of a game in itself trying to stay neutral and not burning any other players until the end. It is mainly an area control game with blind auctions for the areas and it works great for this game. There's some difficult choices figuring what areas to go for and who to stab in the back. The theme works nicely and it's something different then other area control games, and the components are great. The game can run a little longer than I would like at times, but with the right group this game can see lots of play.

:sugar: :( :( :) :D :D Upgrading this rating from a 7.5 to a 9.

This is the best Martin Wallace game Martin Wallace did not design.

I really can't say enough good stuff about this game. Tammany Hall is a very well-executed area-control Euro with tons of player interaction, solid integration between theme and mechanics and a simple set of rules (only two possible basic actions per turn) that undergird a game whose strategies are subtle and complex. It plays quite quickly with minimal downtime. It looks positively beautiful on the board, taking full advantage of period artwork now in the public domain. (Illustrating the municipal office tiles with cartoons from Thomas Nast is no less brilliant for being the obvious choice.) The game gently ramps up the difficulty for the first-time player by not introducing the slander mechanics or the municipal offices until turn 5, and the municipal offices are a clever catch-up mechanism that do not feel gratuitously tacked on.

There is room for player negotiation if that's your style, and it is also possible to play this purely analytically as a multi-player, multi-dimensional area control game where small changes to the board state can cause dramatic cascading effects that affect multiple opponents' positions as well as your own. Either way works; the emphasis on one or the other will be largely an effect of play group style, but the sharpest players will choose a little from column A and a little from column B.

Gamers who are driven to distraction by the potential for collusion and/or gamers who loathe blind-bidding as a mechanism should probably give this one a wide berth. For everyone else, there's Tammany Hall.

(New edition)

Tammany Hall is an area influence game. It's even more stripped back than El Grande, which is really saying something, though it does have some interesting layers to the play.

The base of the game is placing boss pieces into districts of the board which also contain immigrant cubes in 4 colours. You can either place 2 boss pieces, or a boss piece with an immigrant cube from a pool of 6. After 4 rounds of this, an election occurs and boss pieces are reduced to 1 in each area. The winner of each district gets a VP, and the immigrant cubes in each area are summed. The person with control of the most Irish/German/&c. cubes gets influence chips in that immigrant group which are useful on future turns and the person who controlled the most areas becomes mayor. The mayor is given the task of divvying out special powers to the other players for the next 4 rounds that allow them to move/remove immigrant cubes, lock areas, &c. The only other thing to note is the ability to use slander chips to remove opposing boss pieces from the board, provided that immigrants of a type you have influence in are present.

I wanted to like this game. I really wanted to like this game. The theme is in my wheelhouse and I like nasty games where players get to make decisions for others like the mayor phase. This game was disappointing though, there just isn't enough of a check on player piece placement, so the game devolves into constant tit-for-tat placement and occasional slander. Players need to keep each other in check continuously, and one player who takes advantage of the situation by advancing their own agenda rather than beating on people with the present advantage will throw a huge spanner in the works. I would ideally like to take the immigrant/mayor part of this game, and then see it grafted onto a more El Grande type system where the piece placement is more restricted, because as it stands, I think the free-form nature of that phase is the game's biggest weakness and that it outright sinks an otherwise potentially interesting design. Yet more proof that more player options does not always make for a better game.

RATING: 9.5
This rocketed up my list of favorites. You can teach this game in minutes, even leaving key elements until the second round when they come into play. By the fourth round, even newbies are really competitive.

This is the back-stabbiest, pick-on-the-leader, don't trust anyone! kind of game that I have. I LOVE IT!

It's mathy, but you can't really figure it out because of the blind bidding.

It's back-stabby, but the reasons for each attack always feel rational, so it doesn't feel personal.

It is simple to explain and deep to play.

It pulls you in.

And let's face it, the board is gorgeous.

It's in my top 5, may be in the top 3. I'm going to sit down one day and determine if it's higher than that.

I had high hopes for this title, but I regret to say that they haven't come to fruition (yet). The game does a truly excellent job of portraying the wasps' nest that was New York in the late 19th century, and gives the players a wonderful opportunity to practice Machiavellian tactics on each other. Everything the Italian author wrote about can be found to some extent in Tammany Hall. Helping along the entire affair is a set of relatively clean majority mechanics with a few twists which, in theory, ought to keep things interesting to the final voting procedure.

But in practice... The game suffers to a great extent from the problem that someone with little board presence is effectively knocked out of the game itself. He cannot take on the other players because he lacks the influence to do so, and the game won't give him a single shred of it—not even with judicious use of his ability to slander another player or the actions allowed to him by whoever turned out to be Mayor for that round of turns. It is very easy for a strong player to remain strong; it is also very easy for a weak player to remain weak; and the end result is an unsatisfying game experience for at least one and sometimes two players. [b]That is[/b], if you define 'unsatisfying' in terms of 'amount of control a player has over his own destiny to win this game'. It is quite possible that a playing holding a strong position is brought low through cooperation, dealmaking, cajoling and everything else you can find in [i]Il Principe[/i], but if such a mode of play does not come natural to you, you are best served by looking for some other majority game to play. To date I have not yet played with people whose character is sufficiently resillient to handle such brutal game play, and thus the rating of Tammany Hall suffers as a consequence—without a functional metagame Tammany Hall is simply rather weak.

A particularly nasty problem is that nearly every solution you can think of to remedy this situation (thus making Tammany Hall an interesting title to play on its [i]mechanical[/i] merits) completely destroys the strong coupling of subject and mechanics. Every solution is a gamey 'fix' to make sure that the [i]game[/i] works as is usually expected of them, rather than as a vehicle to tell a story no matter who gets his ass kicked. It feels like sacrilege to introduce a house rule like 'the weakest player gets to slander for free' or 'the weakest player gets double influence'. Why on Earth would such a weakling be able to do these things? Because of his successful grassroots campaign or something? As a result I have abandoned attempts to come up with a 'fix' of sorts; and continue waiting until I have a group who can stomach the harsh reality of 19th century New York politics.

As a result, the game really should be rewarded with two rates. One rate is what I expect it to be with a good group: 7 to 8. Yes, it's that good. I've never played Diplomacy, but based on hearsay I expect Tammany Hall to deliver the same amount of nastiness in a fraction of the time. And the other rate is with a 'bad' group, which is what I've currently given.

Stratamax Version with a beautiful map. Area control game with a political theme (New York City politics in the latter half of the 19th Century - the days of Boss Tweed). Rules are very simple and most are displayed clearly on the board. But the gameplay is not simple as confrontational tactics rule in this game. Players are ward bosses bringing immigrant groups (Irish, English, German, and Italian) into various wards in NYC and thereby gaining political favor with those groups. In a 16 year game, an election is held every 4 years (ward by ward) in fierce contests to determine the Mayor for the next 4 years. The Mayor gets more points than the others but must then dole out powerful roles to the other players who use those roles to attack the mayor and each other. Very high replayability. Supports 3-5 players but first timers should start with a 3 player game as there is less chaos with only 2 other opponents and part of the map is used early on, and then expanded as the game progresses. Great game with 3, 4 or 5.

This is a game that starts out slow but then picks up after the first election (starting in turn 5). It is also a game where being in last place coming into the election cycle does not mean you will lose, there are plenty of ways to come out ahead.

I really like how being the mayor seems like the best title (and it does give three points) but ultimately it seems like winning the mayorship guarantees being trampled the next election.

Brainburner!!...

The ideia is great: on each turn, each player fights for the favours (votes) of the immigrant population in several districts of NYC in the earlier XX century, with the aim of beeing elected mayor and elected more times by game end.
The problem is that the effort for an election always drains the strenght for a re-election, and worse, the game goes along through some 3 hrs where, at all times, multiple and hard calculations have to be made, with lots of AP, also because those calculations are useless until the player before you has the chance to play.
This way, here we could had a great game but, just like it is, it's hardly playable or fun, mainly due to that terrible...brainburning!

Players are trying to build a political power base in 19th century New York.  Mechanically simple game where players take turns to deploy "bosses" onto political wards (areas) in New York, trying to influence the local migrant population to their side (Irish, English, Germans, Italians ... more?).  Bosses and influence help you win the mayoral elections, and lead to even greater influence.  Victory points are awarded for becoming mayor, controlling wards, and so on.  Vicious, nasty cube pusher that probably feels great if you are doing well, but when you're knocked about in the early turns you're reduced to becoming a whipping post/spectator for an hour or more.  Drier than the Atacama too.  El Grande did this stuff much better 15 years ago.

Ultimately I prefer el grande. That game is more calculable and straight forward. From reading TH's rules it would appear to be the more simple, however the gameplay, to its credit, is actually more difficult, more opaque, especially due to the blind bidding that also opens this game up to negotiation in a way, or an extent,  not found in el grande. This might give this game an edge over el grande in ones opinion. I however don't really like the blind bidding as much as I hoped. Still it's obviously a very good game.

This is a fantastic game! A relatively simple area majority game infused with blind biddi g and negotiation. The rules are simple and allow for the players to really play each other. Place bosses In districts to win elections, place immigrants in districts to earn their favor...then use their favor in contested districts. 

Then, once the Mayor is elected he or she must dole out positions that are so incredibly powerful and frustrating that it makes you hate yourself for winning that last election. 

So many laughs and tense moments in this game. It doesn't overstay it's welcome and has just enough moving parts to entice more strategic players, but simple enough rules to easily pick up, teach and play. 

This is a masterpiece In my eyes.

Pandasaurus games would only respond to emails if you try and hit every outlet (their site, kickstarter, BGG, facebook, etc...).  Pandasaurus never replaced the broken parts and ended up having to refund a separate purchse that they could not make good on.  It's too bad the rebirth of this game had to be marred by the inexperience of a new company.

I'm not rating the game a 1 out of respect for the Designer.  Is there a way to rate publishers?  I give Pandasaurus a negative ten (-10).

become the big boss of politics in Manhattan during the mid to late 19th century ... the mechanics of this area control game are quite simple .. no 875 choices of moves for mega points via Stefan Feld .. there are only two choices you can make for your move .. but oh .. how this just builds and builds ... election time .. and hand out those city offices ... although in real life, I hate politics, over the gaming board, it is perfectly acceptable (that's it--methinks real life politician believe it is all a game) ... good player interaction, and the early leader does not run away with this game, as in many others -- in fact, the person bringing up the rear can easily win, as has happened in our games .. great area control, solid theme, a slice of real life--as the double cross goes in .. my only complaint would be the dark map of Manhattan tends to absorb the darker colours (purple, brown) of the gaming ward bosses, making this hard to see .. play in exceptional light .. needed more lighter colours against the dark background -- otherwise, for my money, an outstanding game ..

Brillant Game!  Love the interaction... I can see this getting alot of play time in our group.


Bumped up to a 10!  The depth of strategy to this game keeps getting better.  It has a component of "playing" your opponents.  I have played with 10-12 different people and each brings something different to the game.  No one strategy will work consistently.... It is a challenge and a different game everytime out!

Excellent area control game that lives or dies on the decisions made by all players. The leader can pull away unless dealt with, but there's plenty of room to sway people to your side. There's always going to be someone that falls behind the other players, so keep the game short and it's still fun for all.

45-60m, best with 4-5 players. < 5 plays.

Fantastic area control that actually has chunks of theme. Very cutthroat. Very smooth. Loaded with opportunity for trash talk and revenge. The three player experience is probably the weakest. It's better than El Grande for an area control three player game, but still suffers from 90% of the three-player Euros.... two people fight and take each other out, or two people gang up and take one guy out.

RATING: 7
A game about 19th century New York City politics that effectively recreates the harsh realities. Whether or not that works for you is probably dependent on how well your group negotiates as it's up to the players to balance things out here.

Players place cubes in different neighborhoods, some which offer bonus effects, then fight it out for control. They bid for control of territories using influence discs, and in doing so weaken themselves for bidding in other areas such that the balance of power can easily shift. I generally don't like blind-bidding and thought I was undone by my initial bid of 11 to 1 (d'oh!), but I hung on to win so I'm glad to see situations like that aren't fatal. The Mayor hands out special bonus powers to all the other players (one per player), even his enemies, which makes for an interesting decision each turn. 

In typical multiplayer game fashion, you don't want to be the perceived leader here, so diplomacy will get frantic as you approach the very short game end. I'm not one for negotiation games, but this is one I'd like to play again as it's not totally dependent on the negotiating. There's room for clever play with the board and bonus actions and the way you spend your influence discs. With a group skilled at keeping each other in check, this should be a lot of fun, and it's just the right length for this type of experience clocking in at a crisp 90 minutes.

Very much enjoy the meanness in this one. It is possible you get left in the dust by more conniving players and the rich get richer elements. Watching the player in first place giving powerful abilities to their competitors is excellent and I wish we could see that in other games. Doesn't go over with every player, but if you like slamming your friends about and can give as good as you take then this one could be for you.

An exceedingly strong area control game with lots of viciousness, yet beautifully simplistic. Unique theme carried out nicely (Political control of immigrants of New York city around 1850). 

The first term goes very fast, but then the game picks up momentum rapidly in board presence but the terms (4 terms, 4 years each) take longer. There is some brain burning and analysis paralysis with the wrong people.

Great looking board with a good informative layout. The brown and the purple Bosses (player pieces) are so close in color, difficult to tell them apart, especially if the lighting is a little poor. Rule sheet short and simple.

If you like games with lots of interaction and back stabling, get this one.

This one is a keeper.

Note: After a few more plays, my friend, a Martin Wallace enthusiast, noted this looks like a Martin Wallace Treefrog Game. I said well it certainly plays like one, but no it isn't.  Upon searching the rules my friend said, see--and he showed me that Martin Wallace shared in the development.  Definitely Martin Wallace like.

I have only played this once and really liked it.  I loved the theme.  I didn't fee like it had a runaway winner problem, maybe a runaway loser problem.  I felt like the mechanics dragged a leader back down (you better have a good lead if you win the 3rd election)

RATING: 7
Playing this gave me a somewhat different experience than what I usually get with area control games. The reasons being, I believe: there is a bit of history, the theme is unique and the role selection rotation is a nice spin on things. It is quite cutthroat and this may detract from the fun some people might look for during a board gaming activity. It is a solid game, overall with decent-enough art and serviceable components.

A little bit of a runaway leader problem but once this is pointed out or, as long as everyone is aware of it from the outset, this is a fantastic game. It's really tense as you spend the term positioning your pieces and cubes and then even more fun with closed fist bidding and the bluffing, jostling and backstabbing this brings. Players will combine to peg back the leader (or should!) but then chose a moment to break their alliance and try to strike out on their own.
Just a great 'table' experience.

Simply yet another area majority game? I don't think so. Tammany Hall is right up there with classics like El Grande, and it actually feels more controllable because is has a very small rule set pretty much without randomness like the cards. The blind bidding with favour chips is akin to the castillo, but more universally used and without the memory aspect.

The position of mayor is both very strong and very weak. Becoming mayor means you control most wards, and this already get more victory points to which the office adds another 3. Since there aren't that many ways to gain VPs that is quite powerful. During the next term, however, the mayor is the only player without additional powers which is a huge disadvantage and can easily send you struggling to keep up with the pack.

This is definitely what all Euros should come with...the ability to slander, steal, destroy what your opponent builds!  Player interaction is at a premium here, with plenty of opportunities for backstabbing.

I think my rating will go up with some plays.

What concerns me is the possibility of AP players doing math repeatedly and slowing the game down.  If you play with your gut, go in and wage war in districts and sweat the details later, you'll have a good time.  If you constantly count cubes and such over and over and over again before every move, it's going to grind to a halt.  I do have to penalize a game sometimes if it can cause that to happen.  Better not to play with those folks, of course.

I don't normally like any games that involve negotiation, but this is an exception.  I do feel like the table talk slows the game down a lot.  Once slandering and election roles come into play, it bogs down even more.  This game needs multiple plays with the same group to really get a feel for it.

RATING: 7.5
After one play. Area control / bidding game with aggressive, take that elements. I read and watched all these reviews saying how the game is brutal and mean, and was wondering just how bruised and resentful I was going to get playing this game, and was pleasantly surprised. I mean, yes, it is mean, and it is aggressive, and it is brutal, and I got beat up on by three other players after taking an early lead, but it didn't bother me the way other games with take that can bother me. 

For one thing, it never feels like people are being mean for the sake of being mean--the players are jostling for position, so when others attack you it's typically because they're trying to gain influence somewhere where you are, and if you get bumped off, again, it's to their advantage, and not something to hurt you and only to hurt you.  The map is rather fluid, and there can be wild swings in momentum/standing. As a result, the game can feel chaotic, but it never feels like you have no control over what you do. Everything is a result of thought-out intentions. 

It seems that there is a focus on tactical play, placing cubes here and there, using influence chips here and there, bumping this person off, etc., but there's also long term strategy involved, where you have to consider whether you are trying to amass more influence with certain particular ethnicities. More plays will tell just how much long term strategy affects the outcome. 

With AP-prone players, people who like to calculate out point and possibility, this game can really drag, though. Ideally would play with a 30 second timer. All in all, an enjoyable, tense game. Will be looking forward to playing more of this.

Extremely elegant & simple no-nonsense system that reflects well on the theme- a type of El Grande at the 5 Points in old NYC. Very easy to pick up and play. If you enjoy political election & backstabbing themes, then try this game. The favor chip mechanism makes sense and thoroughly integrates into the game. It's a constant battle of weighing your options.

Simple area majority mechanics - basically place 2 meeples (votes) per turn - plus a hidden bidding auction to determine control after 4 rounds - get some Vp and advanatges, do that 4 times. Bash the leader is mandatory but then another player will benefit - the winner may well be the player who interacts the least. The last few turns can be very AP prone if your group is that way inclined.

The new bits are all good although the board is very dark and the special(?) top-hat meeples are barely discernable from the normal meeples.

This style of game is better with more players but then takes to long for what it is.

I heard a lot of good things about this. It's merely decent though. Simple mechanics, but it's too much of a 'points calculator'. It suffers from AP, drawing it out a bit longer than it should be. I found the era interesting, but I dont feel as if the theme draws me in here. My group also did not seem to be as engaged with this...there weren't many dealings/backstabbing/competitive shennanigans, nor incentive to really do so, which ultimately makes or breaks a game of this nature. I'll take Dominant Species over this any day.

A combative area control game with a good amount of interaction and planning combined with some sneakiness. Don't really have desire to play this, but it is a pretty good fairly quick slug fest.

I've only played this online so far so I think I'm missing the table-talk, backstabbing, and general drama of the immigrant chip reveals that are at the heart of this game. Still, I've noticed that the first 1/3 of the game is spent dancing around your opponents as you try to carve out a niche in the constricted confines of the Manhattan voting districts. After the first term, the game picks up steam and the real wheeling and dealing begins. 

TH often gets mentioned in the same breath as El Grande but I have to say I prefer El Grande more. There may not be the same kind of backroom deal-making you get in TH, but the card play makes for more dynamic board states and I like the push and pull the power cards create with trying to vie for turn order while recruiting Caballeros from the Provinces. 

Perhaps my initial thoughts will change after getting in a few face-to-face plays.

A mixture of known mechanics (blind bidding / majorities for area control) with a serious theme. It is well done but still there are some complaints: the colors and kind of a runaway leader syndrom. This leader must not particularly 1 player but as well two player that dominate the other 2 players in a 4player game. Even though I was amongst the smarter two or at least luckier two. Our fellow players had after term two not even a small chance to catch up. I am sure they will rate the game significantly lower than me.

Beautiful components, I mean, beautiful beautiful components. 

The game is simple to play but a good brain burner and a cut throat affair. It fits the perfectly well the setting. 

It suffers some problems: namely leader bash and some kingmaking. Perceptions at the table can make and unmake a game, personal feelings can always go in the way of the best laid plans. Once again perfectly suited for the setting.

The game also plays in a couple of hours, therefore it is short, deep and sweet, as long as you're not the one on the blunt end of the baton, you may be easily wiped out if you don't play your cards well, there is a grudge, or you are simply unlucky. 

Sensitive souls keep out.  

UPDATE
Replayed this game last night. Now now, you need some mental preparation to play this game or it could give you some sour moments. Things can be made and unmade by the other players, if you have a player who attacks always you in games, keep out of this one, life on the streets is hards just as it is. 

There is a fine pleasure in breaking one's promises, if you can't handle your own mischief and other people's oath breaking, do yourself a favor, keep out. :)

Great game. This is NOT an area control game. I played it that way the first time and I lost by quite a lot. It's really about amassing political tokens, the heads on the ground are almost irrelevant.

Anyway, this is a fantastic game, moving quickly with plenty of meaty decisions to make. The political offices bring the game to another level, adding subtle strategy to an already unique game. The bidding during elections is another brilliant addition. Those prone to overthinking their moves may suffer during this game, but you can't really plan too ahead, so it encourages the AP-prone to just "wing it". Mildly cutthroat, great graphics, theme tied perfectly to the game mechanics, this one is highly recommended.

Another 'area control' game.  

I really enjoyed my first play of this.  There was a bunch of tension while you played out your moves and hoped they would still be there when it was your time.  

Taking points early seemed to help a lot because it was a deceptively low scoring game resulting in a fairly close out come.

While this is an interesting take on area majority, the whole game feels too... transparent. In an age where non-random seems to be a high feature in games, here it seems like a boon. To have all of the information readily available with a mechanic that is so straightforward means that the games tension is primarily political. This is not a bad thing per say, but the game parades as something else. Perhaps I am projecting my assumptions onto it as the result of all the other area majority games I have played, however if you happen to sit at a table of non-table-talkers the game somewhat breaks down.

The aesthetics here are great though!

RATING: 7.5
Tammany Hall is a sharp, focused area-control game, with a strong theme and interactive game play.

The theme of New York City political infighting is brought out in the struggles for control of wards in lower Manhattan. 

The game actions are simple enough that there is little confusion over available choices (except perhaps in the Slander rules) and while there are many choices I didn't find much opportunity for over-thinking the actions.  

This one should play straight through, albeit with occasional pauses to wipe the blood off your daggers.

I liked the quick pacing, I liked the straightforward game play and the head-to-head interaction as bosses setup for the ward face-offs. I liked the hand-off awards and the way that immigrant favoritism plays out for the rounds to follow.

While this is no Die Macher, playing out over an extended series of political re-balancings, this game captures the feel of political mechanics really well, as well as the way in which some wards slide through easily, while others are drawn-out wrestling matches.

I won't hesitate to start this at a strong 7.5, and to plan to get it back on my table fairly soon. It took a long time coming but I think it was worth the wait.

In some ways this is everything that is cool about area control games.  The number of actions a player has is very limited and it's all about choosing to compete over a valuable space or go somewhere that's less in demand.  The part that it took me a turn or two to get my head around is that you are fighting not just over the specific areas but over control of the cubes that happen to be in them.  

Meanwhile, the discs that players gain by controlling cubes give them more power in the future.  So it's area control with memory, in a way, which is a really neat idea.

It seems like there's potential for a lot of really weird things to happen in this game, and I can see the potential for a player to get cut out of the game in games with more players -- I only played with three -- so I have some reservations about it. But it's a really cool idea. (1 play)

Almost an abstract game for its minimalist area control mechanic perfection! Might be a 10 for the supporting game architecture and vicious gameplay. If you enjoy playing this game, then you may also like Vanuatu.

Update: Rating dropped slightly due to turn order concerns at high player counts.

Great area control game with plenty of negotiation and the right amount of luck and bluffing. Rating will probably go up as I play more. Might be interesting to have a variant where you can use your voters to vote for other players; this could make it even more cut-throat, but would contribute to a bash-the-leader problem. The fixed turn order is a shame- maybe it could be linked to the offices.

Brilliant area control game.  Simple mechanics, but there is a lot to think about with every move.  Loads of player interaction (i.e. threats).  Ganging up on the leader is necessary because he/she can run away with it.  I love the theme.

RATING: 9
Brutality in a box.  Tammany Hall strips the area control concept down to the bone and revels in the viciousness that ensues.  The theme is incredibly well integrated, both mechanically and interactively - having even the [i]appearance[/i] of an advantage can make you a target for an opponent's attack.  Playing the game well is just as much about managing appearances as it is about manipulating board position, and the extremely limited number of turns (16 total!) makes every move important.  The games looks fantastic as well, and Pandasaurus' production is top notch.

Tammany Hall is a good game. I enjoyed playing it, quite a lot actually, though the mass of cubes all over the board gets to be a bit hard to process by the middle of the game. It makes the election step become a bit tedious by the last couple of election rounds, but it's really not a detriment to the game.

I played with 5 players. I would really like to try it with 3, because for most any game, even ones where OMG YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT WITH A FULL TABLE SOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER (I'm looking at you, Twilight Imperium. No. Just.. no), I find 3-4 to be about the sweet spot. I think that would hold true for Tammany Hall as well.

Unfortunately, I don't think it would see much play in my group. One of my gamer buddies played in the game I did, and he wasn't too keen on the area control business. Another doesn't care much for Euros, which definitely describes this game. I had to drop my Kickstarter pledge down from the pre-order level down to a $5 'thanks for doing this' to Pandasaurus, or I fear I'd have a game I wanted to play but never could bring out.

I hope lots of people love and enjoy the reprint, though. This game definitely deserves attention.

Area control with nice strategic play.  Needs to be played a few times to understand the nature of this area control (elements snowball in the early part of the path and really alters the outcomes of areas further along the path:  effects are always determined in a linear unchanging order but once one area is won, rewards occur immediately allowing you to affect the next or later areas).

This game captures so much of what I love in a board game: low rules overhead, high player interaction, and mechanics that evoke the theme. So impressive how the lovely board, some wooden bits, and the intuitive set of rules really manage to evoke the theme of corrupt politics in 19th century NYC. Be warned, the game is very confrontational and somewhat unforgiving, with the potential for players to take a big lead or fall way behind by the game's mid-point. But I don't necessarily take those as negatives: Instead, I consider this  a 10 with players who know the game and an 8 with those who don't. Can't say enough about the game's elegance.

Almost all of the information one needs to win a game of Tammany Hall is on the table except for one critical thing: what is in your opponents' heads. Trying to read the board and identify what each player is thinking is paramount to success, creating a tense affair as each decision is revealed. It has a couple of rough edges, but Tammany Hall is overflowing with enough clever mechanics and exciting, interesting decisions to create some excellent tactical gameplay.

It's a political game, and catching up to a player who has forged ahead winds up being a gang-up-on-the-leader proposition.  Negotiation ends up playing a part even though it's not a negotiation game.  I had an okay time playing it, but I don't see myself wanting to jump in again.  I'm not a fan of gang-up-on-the-leader or of negotiation.

First off I'm not a big area control guy.  The art and the theme made me curious but I decided to not kickstart the game.  That said,  having played this a few times I enjoyed both experiences more then I figured I would.  Built in catch-up mechanics (with correct play) and quick turns that allow the game to flow moderately. With four the play time of 90 minutes is reasonable.  Concerns include last place player viability and just the scheer nastiness of the game.  I think it's beautifuly filty but at least warn folks before you offer this up.  

I'm really not sure what to compare this game to.  Some weak comparisons my group threw out were Small World and El Grande.  Buy this game if the art excites you and your group has a high tolerance for brutal interaction.

Really great area control/negotiation game with an awesome historical feel. The rules are simple, but the design is really pretty brilliant. There's a lot of strategy and interesting decisions.

Good incorporation of theme for a Euro. At its core an area control game not to dissimilar from Martin Wallace's Liberte, wherein you are vying for controlling interest over particular voting groups within a given space. However, this one lacks the possibility for alternative endings that Liberte has and as a result focuses instead on bashing the leader (real or perceived).

played once with 4.  GREAT, fun experience.  The game's ruleset is simpler than I had imagined, and it creates a ton of emergent gameplay-- especially with the right group.

Some aspects of it are quite good: for example, I like the tradeoffs between stacking too many cubes of different colors for domination purpose and making the precinct more vulnerable to more players.

However, I absolutely despise the bookkeeping involved in the game. The game state is just not clean and easy to read. Too hard to keep track of who has how many cubes of which colors. This increases AP quite a bit.

Also don't like games with closed fist auction mechanics where losers still pay their bid.

Fun area control game. Reminds me a little of El Grande or Mission Red Planet. Love the risky blind bidding aspect. Felt thematic.

It was suggested in games with less than 5 players, the unused roles get cycled so that all will eventually get used, at least on every other election.

Also, in the rare case that two players tie for mayor, it shouldn't remain the previous mayor. That is not thematic. Some other method should be chosen to break the tie between the leaders instead. Perhaps the player closest to the current mayor in clockwise order.

Not a bad game...

I really don't like the Queen making, and the brutal ganging up on the leader dynamic. My good decisions are only a small part of my success. A lot rests in the hands of others, making for a very unsatisfying lack of control. This makes the game feel tense which is nice and is something lots of people comment on. 

The game is also very analytical and AP prone. I think I would be happy to observe a group of rational agents play this game, but some serious problems creep in when played with humans.

Kickstarted.  Played twice in a row during a game night.  First game was with polite timid players, next wasn't and that's when it really shone through.  Although there was both a runaway leader (who was caught and made to pay) and a runaway loser who really couldn't do anything but spoil the party.  I'd like to play a couple more times to see if that pattern holds.

Replay 2016 - I'm torn on this game. There's no meaner area majority game around. It's a game of extreme ups and downs. Players will get annoyed. The best strategy is 'suboptimal' play to not get into focus, stay behind the leader while calmly building up your power base for the final round and pray that the blind bids work out while not getting screwed more than average. For such a type of game, the mechanisms are condensed perfectly, providing a lean framework for ruthless interaction, backstabbing and lots of emotion, be it positive or negative.

Kind of liked the one game of this I played (2009 release, with lovely production). A bit like Liberte without cards, and with some variable player powers to spice things up. I just loved the dynamics of muscling your way into election victory by treading on other people's toes, and then having to give all the good powers to your enemies, who'll probably have a long memory...

The main issue I have with the game is the blind bidding with all bidders losing their bid. That's a horrible mechanism to saddle the game with. For example the one game was literally determined on a coinflip, when two players had 6 vs 10 chips and with two areas to score. If the player with 6 guessed right in which area to make a stand, he'd win one. Otherwise the player with 10 would win both, and with that the game. With absolutely no information to go on, the first player flipped a coin, and the coin picked wrong. Not a nice way to end a 90 minute game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Given this a lot of thought and I simply can't recommend this game.  I thought gameplay was interesting and there is little downtime as every single play affects how you're doing and what you will do on future turns.  The ultimate problem with this game is that it allows for too much flexibility on a players turn and this makes for an extremely chaotic game that 1. lends itself to always dicking the leader and regressing everyone to the mean, and 2. penalizing anyone who plays better.  The leader immediately becomes a target and every player can do something on their turn to hurt them.  It doesn't matter what the targeted player does, there is no overcoming this.  So if you had a better strategy and better score after the first two elections/scoring rounds then you are bound to be ganged up on and get nearly wiped from the board on the next turn or two regardless of what you do.

A good (i.e. mean) area control game that has many elements nicely tied to the theme. It does require a certain amount of balance (as most area control games do) or a runaway leader may emerge. I do like that the person who is elected major (a) gets no special powers for the next term, (b) has to take his action first each year and (c) has to assign the roles to the other players. Bashing the leader is a big part of this and it is not for the timid. After all, a game that allows you to slander your opponents requires some tough skin.

One play. 3 players. I got shut out after the first election, winning only one ward and no population bonuses. That meant everyone else had tons of influence tokens to drown me out and always saw me as an easy target. It became a 2-player game, though the two leads didn't fight much with each other. Next time I'll know to pay more attention to the immigrant demographics.

Through the political offices, the game does have some catch-up mechanisms, or more accurately, gang up against the leader mechanisms. And the theme is very, very rich in this game. Even though it was a lost cause for me, I enjoyed it and would gladly play again. It seems better suited for 4-5 players, to balance out competition for the wards and make the immigrant pool in Castle Gardens more of an issue. I also wish there was some way to shuffle the player order (maybe I missed that in the rules), since it seemed like last player had a strong advantage with slander and final placement.

---- edit: July 18, 2015. Played a 5 player game with the same three players as last time and two new ones. The game certainly felt a lot more dynamic and uncertain. We added a house rule of the mayor becoming first player, since having the last word seems like a bigger benefit than first choice of the immigrant pool.

The three experienced players all understood the value of the influence tokens -- if you run out of them, you don't stand a chance. Two players still got shut out fairly early on, though I think with experience and open collusion, there could be stronger challenges to the leader. Lesson: you can't leave a person unchallenged, even if they have a lot of influence tokens. 

Simple rules and rich theme are big plusses. Play is dynamic, but I continue to worry about runaway leaders and the lack of catch-up mechanisms.

Played with two friends.  The setting sounds interesting but the game play wasn't very captivating by the time we were halfway through.  It's a very simple game that takes a minute or two to learn but that simplicity means it didn't hold our attention very long.

The instructions recommend you make deals and bargain with other players but the game play didn't really coax much of that out.

There's also some confusion regarding which colour cube or disk you're supposed to receive when you win certain election ridings because the colours are ambiguous on the printed board.

Game components are high quality.

Mayoral politics in 19th-century NY city.  The game features probably the most effective use of simple mechanics to capture historical theme that I have ever encountered.  Each turn involves a couple of basic actions, placing ward bosses and assisting immigrants, to achieve a couple of basic goals: amassing political influence and winning political office.  Winning the race for mayor brings bonus victory points but also results in having no special power for the the next four years.  The mayor's only power is to assign the four offices with special abilities to the other players.  The result is intense negotiation, politcal maneuvering, and vicious backstabbing.  A simply brilliant design the captures the feel of 19th-century NY politics and delivers 90 minutes of intense, nail-biting action.

The best area control game I've played. 

I prefer this to El Grande, as I think the role selection here is more interesting than the card play in El Grande, and the game is simpler, tighter, and more active.

The only problem with this game is that is can be a bit opaque for some players, which can cause AP issues. In all other respects it is a brutal area-control masterpiece that brings out interesting social dynamics.

RATING: 5
A area of majority game that is not that complex to play. If you are color blind stay away. because that game has 2 level of analysis a bit like king of siam and dominant species which makes it harder to analyze the board.

I played with 3 players and it was OK, but I imagine that at 5 players it would be deadly. I am not sure if the game is really the same with different amount of players. Also with less players, some roles that could be judged as too powerful would never be assigned.

I did not really like the game, but one positive thing is it's simplicity even if the game is still complex. For example, you can only chose one of 2 actions on your turn which both consist in placing stuff on the board but in different quantity. Else, the special power gives you a special ability each turn, and you have 3 limited use actions to spread rumors. 

So compared to other area of majority or worker placement game, you are not struggling between various actions and abilities you can perform and trying to find which one suite you best. You either place 2 meaples on 1 meaple and a cube. It's as simple as that.

Despite the nicely done reprint, the game doesn't do much for me.  It is fairly simple to play, but does not feel overly dynamic or interesting as you generally will just be placing two guys each turn...or a guy and one influence.  There just didn't feel like much possibility to influence change in the regions unless someone made a mistake.  Players also need to really hold each other in check and I'm not certain there are enough rounds in the game to really do this, nor if there are enough checks and balances as well.  I'd much rather just play El Grande.  I find that area majority/influence games tend to really pale to El Grande although I keep trying...;-)  These are all just first impressions - but I have no plans to have second impressions.

El Grande is pretty much the king of area control games, and I like it a bunch. I'm planning on grabbing the reprint in November. But as good as a game as it is, it doesn't really make much sense. What is happening in it? Who are these things? What's this supposed to be simulating? It's fine, because it's a fun, good game, so you don't really worry about any of that.

But Tammany Hall shows you how it could be. What is more area control than elections? What is more interesting than heated, demilegal elections? Tammany Hall has little betophatted figures and cubes and disks, but is a hell of a lot more thematically sound than most of the other nonsense that's declared "dripping with theme" around here. The actions make narrative sense and are all tied together through the theme. There's no question about how what you're doing fits in. As a result, you end up with a fun, well-tooled game that also provides a compelling narrative other than "and then Tim put his cubes there and got like 8 points for it!!" 

What's more, it does all this with minimal fuss. The rules are actually pretty easy to learn. The artwork is handsome and evocative and doesn't provide noisome clutter. The game encourages a lot of sass-talk, negotiation, and banter. There's a lot of game in this package. I don't know if it's better than El Grande, but it's certainly up there.

I have been playing this game on www.slothninja.com .  Very engaging, but even better in person because of the trash talk and easily-made (and broken!) alliances.  Such simple mechanics, the game can move very quickly.  But because player interaction is very high, election results can become complex to predict.  This game is oozing with theme, as it brims over with "take that" and "pile on the leader" gameplay.  The Pandasaurus edition (Kickstarter) for this game has a high quality production value.

A majority control area control game that can be mean.  I really like the mechanic where you place your bosses and complete for control of districts.  Some districts have special benefits or score extra points.  

There is a blind bidding that you use during elections for mayor that is brilliant.  Because you can gamble that a player may not put the most tokens out there and try to win with fewer. It is a game where you don't want to win early as everyone attacks the leader.  

It is probably my favorite majority control game, but it can be mean.  Excellent artwork and components as well.

I like political themed games and this one takes you back to New York when immigrants were pouring in by the boatload. These new citizens have needs and you're going to help them, in exchange for their votes of course. You want a lot of favor and catering to one immigrant group over the others is not going to get you enough. Being elected mayor and doling out the offices is pretty cool.

First impression after two 4p game.  This is a superb area control game with a great presentation and some interesting and innovative mechanics.  Simply brilliant.  Play it ready to fight for every ward election and immigrant favor to the bitter end, seize power early and in so doing help others catch up with you, never feel safe in your lead.  I enjoyed it so much that I can't wait to dive into it again, though I did burn some bridges in my race to be the mayor.  Whether you choose to keep a low profile before the final power grab, or let others spend all their hard earned favors while duking it out, this is dirty politics at its best.  One of the best area control games I have played.

This was right up my alley: area control, simple rules, aggressive gameplay.

I can see how this game could be horrible for some people; thin-skinned people should stay away!

RATING: 9
I could go on forever about this game. It's certainly not like anything else I have played before. Despite some familiar mechanisms, Tammany Hall offers something totally fresh to the area majority market. To be sure, it's not for everyone, especially those with delicate sensibilities. It's also not the best "family" or perhaps "gateway" game. It's a gamers game, for those gamers who want to straight up duke it out--cardboard style. You almost have to go into it with a lighthearted attitude and a willingness to overlook bullying. If you do, you are in for a real treat. 

Let's look at my pro's and con's.

Pro's:
-Phenomenal components (kickstarter edition). You could literally beat someone to death with the board (and perhaps players have tried), the ward boss meeples are thematic and fun, the roles are printed on cardboard stock rather than cards, the map art is bold and brilliant, the box is very sturdy, etc. 

-Simple rules lead to complex decision making. Why can't more games do this? Strip down the rules, and make it more open-ended. It sounds so easy, but with a limited rule set, it's so easy for a game to become "broken" or chaotic. Nevertheless, in my opinion, most of the best games are capable for doing a lot with very little, and Tammany Hall is a shining example.

-Interaction-This might be the most interactive Eurogame I've ever played. It starts with blocking, moves into negotiating/forming alliances, and finally matures with "front stabbing" (if I may quote Joel Eddy). 

Con's:

Play time: Our first game took over 4 hours. Granted, 2 out of 4 of the players at the table have horrible AP. Yet, regardless of this special circumstance, I could see this game ranging anywhere from 60 minutes (on the extreme low end with 3 "fast" people) to 5 hours (with AP-prone players). Some people might not call this a negative, they might say it allows for game differentiation. I would argue that people with busy schedules need to know how long a game is going to take so that they can plan accordingly.

AP: You better believe it. I'm not usually a player that struggles with AP, but in this game, because it's an abstract sprawled over a large board, and perhaps because the wards are hard to quickly differentiate when the board starts filling up, this game can lead to some serious AP and downtime between turns. I was playing with people that were literally taking 15-20 minute terms at crucial points in the game. Granted, you can decide, as a group, to put a cap on this, but if you don't, it's very possible you could be sitting there waiting for your next turn for a long while. 

Runaway leader: You better believe it. If 1 player wins mayor more than once, you better be willing to team up in order to bring that player down. If not, there's almost no way another player can win. This is the semi-cooperative element of the game. I think it's interesting though, because a dark horse can break out of the mist.

Spite: I don't know if this is necessarily a negative, because spite sort of goes with the theme of the game, but Tammany Hall could literally lead to fist fights, divorces and the like if you are not careful who you play with. :)

All things considered, this game is FANTASTIC and more importantly, UNIQUE! I have to be in the mood to play it, but when in that mood, it's going to be a bloody good time!

Blind bidding is one of my least favourite mechanisms, so we are off to a bad start here. But even worse is the amount of information and permutations, which means that I can either spend 20 minutes calculating my move or I can spend 2. I will go for the 2 minutes, and combined with the blind bidding this will result in quite some kingmaking and not very satisfying gameplay. I can respect the design, but this game was so not for me. Love the gameboard, though.

RATING: 7
I think the game has some basic 'classic euro' mechanics (area control, sequence resolution, turn order issues and cube management) that work pretty well. The mechanic of the Mayor (+3 VPs to the person who wins the most wards) is interesting in that while you get +3VPs (which is alot in the game) you must then assign titles to others for the coming election cycle. The mayor doesn't have any special powers but all other titles do, so you must choose wisely. A fairly interesting dilemma. However, it wasn't clear to me last night what the right calls were for each mayor in delegating these titles. Why? They are essentially game/board state powers (I.E. They allow players to change the counts on the board) and the board state can fluctuate so greatly during the 4 rounds of an election that I'm not sure how someone can decide which title is 'best' in this or that player's hand. I would love to play the game with 5, I think it will be much better in that there will be more multi-player ward battles with less players winning wards outright.

RATING: 8.1
This is an area control game where you play as a scheming politician who seeks favor and votes from the local immigrant populations in New York. It has a great catch-up mechanic where the person who gets elected Mayor has to hand out the political positions to his competitors that gives them advantages for trying to gain control of the political situation. I wish more people liked this in my group.

Beautiful production from Warfrog and the game had some nice mechanisms. However, the bonus in voting discs for the ones controlling the most cubes of a colour in a round is way too large.

I was à bit surprised by how the game played. A couple of us made a mistake the first rounds, and it was almost impossible to catch up.  For me, much of the game was deciding who to support for the end game victory run, which I did not relish.  The better-off seemed to stay better-off.  I remember how disappointed. I was when I missed it in Essen a few years ago, but after aging I'm of a different feel.  Would try again, but it will need to play very differently to hook me.  Very odd numbering system of the regions, I might add.

The first play has me hesitant about this game. It was hard to do any negotiating when it wasn't obvious what the beneficial plays were for everyone. By the end of the game there are so many immigrant cubes that it can be hard to keep track of who is leading the different populations without having to recount on your every turn, slowing down the game.

RATING: 8.5
*Sept 2013* After 4 plays, I think I'm finally starting to get this game. It's really confusing and overwhelming what to do, almost like chess. The game is really brilliantly designed. 

Complaints of runaway leader are valid, however I think that with competent play by all players a runaway leader is less and less likely. 

Since this is a game that bears repeat and continual plays, I'm giving it an 8 for now based off my understanding of it and the fun I have playing it. Despite the huge amounts of interaction, it feels more like a puzzle than a social game. 

The first few times I played, I actually felt a bit personally attacked. This feeling has never happened to me in a game before (and I've played some pretty dick-ish games, like Innovation). After 4 plays and my finally somewhat grasping a cohesive strategy (and my bluffing improving a few iotas), I'm not feeling this as much. Prior to this play I was considering selling it (despite it being a group favorite), but now I'm beginning to see something to explore. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good area control game that is well themed, I think. 

Turns move quickly as player actions are restricted to: placing 2 bosses, 1 boss and an immigrant cube (thus gaining an influence disk). Players can play a scandal once per term to remove one boss from the same area and optionally from an adjacent area of the same faction (cost:  1 influence disk of cube colour present for same area and 2 influence disks to remove a boss in an adjacent area, but must use same colour influence disk and attack the same boss faction).

VPs given for winning elections (most controlled districts becomes mayor worth +3 vps), 1 vp per area won, +2 vp at end of game for most influence in a particular colour, +2 vp for winning Tammany Hall location.

Winning elections in an area is the player with the highest total of bosses and influence disks spent in blind bidding. No one wins an area on ties.

Winning the election as mayor does the following:  grants 3 vps, the mayor will become first player for the next term and will allocate city government offices among the other players.

Solid game, willing to play again. Possibly best with 5 players, but certainly playable with 4, not sure if I would play the game with just 3 due to lessened competition.

Not that simple for me and more a brain burner than anything else. Map colors are a bit garish and brown and purple bits are hard to tell apart without bright lighting.

This type of chaotic area control game leaves me absolutely cold as it usually takes me a while to get any idea of what I am doing. Hence I just placed stuff and fell behind quickly with no hope of recovery and so the rest was an exercise in boring futility. Then to add to the misery I was attacked when behind for no good reason other than the player felt they had had no other worthwhile option of any value. So this has a kick a guy when he's already down feel.

The theme is almost completely lost in the chaotic, no rhyme or reason placement. No story or narrative which I really need to be engaged. 

If a game takes me over half the time to understand the flow, it is usually a waste of time to and I have no interest to give it another chance. A classic example of the Euro design that makes the classic mistake failing to get everyone on board in the first to second turn.

One play, so this may shift, but for now I find this game to hit that perfect pitch of simple to teach, yet extremely deep to play - a game where you are truly playing each other rather than the ruleset, and oh boy, what a flat out fight this is. Quite draining, all the bluff and double bluff. Good stuff. Play at your peril.

I can definitely see why this game is widely regarded, but at the same time, it almost gave me a headache to play - it's basically a rules-light but strategically heavy area-control euro with a little negotiation tossed in to keep things interesting. Honestly, I'd have preferred more negotiation and less euro, especially given the theme. I won't say no to future plays, but I don't feel a pressing need to purchase this one.

I love this game.  The rules are brief and easy to understand.  I've had the pleasure of teaching this to more than 5 groups now.  The first 4 years play quickly and without much event.  New players comment on how there isn't much going on or that it doesn't make much sense.  Then there's the first election and its like something clicks and the entire dynamic of the group changes

What I find interesting most about this game is that from such a pared down design a whole dialogue develops spontaneously in the early part of the game without any instigation from the game mechanics.  People just inherently understand what they need to do in order to survive.  In other words, the politics, intrigue, and backstabbing layers that form the backbone of the game grow organically without any prompting from the mechanics game, yet they combine perfectly with the theme.  I liken it to 'The Resistance' in this way, though the two games don't share many other commonalities.  

Ultimately you may lose a few friends during the playing of the game, but afterwards you will share some big laughs.  I highly recommend picking it up.

Never have I played a game where I got so upset as Tammany Hall.

Like: the relatively short playing time, the components and theme, the simple rules that produce strategic depth. The cut-throat nature of the game.

Dislike: That I got so mad while playing. This may go into the like pile after more plays. Not sure how I feel about that yet.

UPGRADED: Bumped score up to an 8 after additional play. Simple rules combined with difficult and meaningful decisions move this game up to an 8 for me. It makes me angry, but I like that a game can get that strong of a reaction out of me.

Just 1 play so far.  On the one hand, I think its pretty brilliant the way it captures the theme and political rivalry/angst of the period.  It is the nastiest, contentious, backstabbing, negotiating, games I've played (more so than New Angeles).  That makes it a very cool and unique experience for me.  On the other hand, it took quite a while to play, and has many similarities to El Grande, which has the contention, but plays quicker because it suffers less from analysis paralysis.

Tammany Hall is a mix between El Grande and Diplomacy. Similar to the former, you need to claim majorities (in specific areas as well as in total number of immigrants), and similar to the latter, you need to strike agreements to divide New York between you. An interesting twist is that the winner each term must hand out powerful offices to the opponents. Tammany Hall may very well work like a pure area majority game but I suspect that it requires negotiating and backstabbing to really shine and hence it may not be a game for everybody.

Note: As many others, I missed components but I contacted the customer support and got replacements quickly. Thank you!

Inferior to El Grande in terms of elegance and downtime. The point differential is smaller but the roles being dealt leads to more downtime and overall I kept thinking I'd rather be playing EG...it feels more convoluted too rule wise. The purity of EG wins out. I also just dislike blind bidding in what is essentially combat, it leads to so many imbalanced pyrrchic situations/chances for luck to impact the game in the randomness of opponents. If someone happens to guess and spend just one more than me, I am totally screwed out of my resources, and I prefer something a bit more knowable and plannable.

A VERY contentious game! I really enjoyed my one play so far and can't wait to get it back on the table. The Mayor (the player that holds the most territory each round) having to give out the other titles is brilliant. Being the mayor gives you 3 VPs, but that's it... you have to give the other players titles that give them HUGE advantages in the upcoming round. Deciding when to make a move for mayor, and when you do, deciding which power to give to each player is sheer agony... but in a good way!

At heart, Tammany Hall is an area-majority game played over five rounds. The winner of each round is elected Mayor and gets bonus points, but has to assign roles to all the other players which give them special powers. The Mayor receives the special power of being everyone else's Whipping Boy.

The theme is all about a cynical, jaded time in NYC politics and it shines through. Tammany Hall needs to be played politely, and in a friendly, inclusive manner... by people who lie, betray, backstab and coldly plot against one another. In other words, the game depends on the right group of people playing, and thin skins might get offended. If you enjoy Junta then this is a game for you.

Elections is an obvious theme for area majority, and it's nicely realised here. Each turn you've a choice of playing 2 meeples or playing 1 meeple and getting a blind bidding chip. After each of the 4 elections, you lose all meeples on the board bar the 1 you leave behind in an area which you win, so it seems that acquiring blind bidding chips is usually the way to go most of the time. For each election, you get 4 turns placing meeples and getting chips. All the standard area-majority strategies apply. Try and get cheap areas. If you're going to compete, don't compete against everybody and lose everything, pick your targets, pick beatable areas, yada, yada, yada. It's not adding anything to the genre there. Each competing area is a blind bid added to your presence, and the blind bid can be 5-10 times bigger than your presence. I had two overwhelming thoughts as I walked away afterwards. First, that's a lot of game time for what turns out to be a series of blind bids - essentially they've taken 10 min Raj and it turned into a 90 min marathon, which gets repetitious. Secondly, it sets up a king with bonus VPs and then everyone whacks him down - and there's little control over whether you become the king (given the blind bidding) and little control over your defenses once you become the king. That's a lot of kingmaking. Which ain't my favourite thoughts for a game of this length given there's no awesome thematically rich gaming experience giving you positive vibes to overcome the player conflict chaos.

Lovely presentation.

I can't decide whether it would be better with mission cards or an event deck. I do like the fact that it doesn't have these things so the concentration is on placing the pieces.

And I am crap at it. But that is my problem!

There are very few choices, but each one counts. Try to get majority in districts in order to get voted as mayor, which gives you points, but no special ability, yet as mayor you get to chose who plays what role in office (and thus which benefit). The game is kept close and each decision is important. A little dry, but still fun to play.

I waited for some time for this to come back into print and I can safely say that it lives up to my expectations. What I really like about Tammany Hall is that the mechanics are simple and easy to teach, but there is a depth of strategy that only starts to show itself after a few games. On top of that the negotiations during elections are great fun and allow plenty of devious double-crosses. I haven't come across a runaway leader problem with the game, in fact, in the games I have played the player who went into the final elections in first has yet to win. This tends to happen because my groups are happy to take the leader down a peg or two. Add that to the fact the the Mayor goes first and doesn't get any special abilities and I can't see a runaway leader happening very often.

The components are great and I love playing with the political favour chips while elections are going down, it makes you feel like you're playing a game of poker.

This is an area majority game where players don't actually control the pieces making up the majorities--instead, they blind bid for them.  While I did enjoy the former, I didn't much care for the latter, as the blind bidding really turned it into a bluffing game (particularly since the loser's bidding chips were expended).  I can see negotiation really being a large part of this game as well, which isn't really my favorite thing either.

Supposedly a mean game but when we played, it didn't really feel like it. Fairly repetitive, the rich kept getting richer and too chaotic for how long it was. It had a few moments, but it just wasn't really that great. Really, really surprised this is rated this highly on BGG. I'd play it once more to see if we missed something, but I really doubt it. There aren't enough rules in this to get it wrong and negotiation and backstabbing really isn't my thing.

Also, the game felt really abstract. None of the nationalities felt any different from one another besides the color of the cube. It felt like a missed opportunity at having unique power. Also the amount of cubes didn't make a damn bit of difference in the ward besides the majority thing at the end of each term. Loading up on cubes in a ward was generally a waste.

Decent area control game and very viscous.  Best to play with people with thick skin.  I like the simple rules, yet having the decisions/politicking about what can happen.  I also like how people play out the votes with the favor chips.

The game seemed to be plagued with AP and doubled its stated time.  I also felt the game was a little too chaotic to control.  I didn't like how the game is designed to avoid the mayor until the final election.

This is a territory control game much like El Grande, except the rules are tuned for extra viciousness and backstabbing.  Most of the decisions you make will be: "X player is trying to steal Y territory from me, do I fight for it or focus my attention elsewhere?"

The rules are actually pretty well-done, but the zero-sum interaction was not fun for me.

Really good game, with really tough decisions, even though the rules are really quite simple. One down side is that it's all open information, so players can be tempted to over think things on their turn (making the game go slower than it should).

I bought this as a Kickstarter and what a mistake. There are way to many great games out there rather than wasting time with this crap. People in my gaming group were actually annoyed at me for having almost 2 hours of their precious game time wasted. Up for sale.

This is a really intense area control game, where you are constantly evaluating the choice of investing in short term vs long term. Short term might win you a spot or two and therefor the points, but long term you get extra tokens that can be only spend once. Those tokens, used at the right time can be the key to victory. The game can sadly devolve into players punching each other for no real gain, but that's the nature of a player negotiation game fail I guess.

I've brought it to the table once so far, at London on Board with a full complement of five players. And it was everything I hoped it would be and more! In essence, it's a double-level area control game, like another favourite of mine, King of Siam. There are two types of pieces on the board - player pieces ('ward bosses') and ethnic factions (Irish, English, German and Italian), which the players can gain and exert control over.

The rules are pretty simple - there are four terms, each of which consists of four rounds of placing bosses and immigrants, followed by an 'election'. Each ward is resolved in turn, with bosses counting as a certain vote, supplemented by blind bids of influence corresponding to the types of immigrants present in the ward. The two levels of influence are tied together because each player counts the number of immigrant cubes in the wards they won, and the majority of each type is rewarded with more influence over that group for future elections.

For us, the game started quite gently - we each seemed to be focusing mainly one one immigrant community (leaving one player squeezed out) and many of the wards were uncontested. But after that things started getting savage. The player who wins most wards each term becomes the Mayor: a blessing and a curse, because it comes with 3VP (out of winning scores of around 20), but he must give each of the other players a significant special power. These powers allow areas to be locked down (like the King in El Grande) and immigrants to be turfed out or relocated, changing who can access wards. And then there's also the 'slander' action which allows bosses to be booted out too. You have to be constantly thinking about the other players and what they're going to do, and making sure you don't let anyone get away with too easy a ride.

I'm not always a fan of blind bidding, but here it works really well. It's an all-pay auction, and the influence chips are valuable, so you can't afford to just chuck a load in. There's a lot of bluffing and doublethink, and one player showed great guts by bidding an empty hand twice running and getting away with it. In the last election, things become more calculable, and the game slows down a bit, but I still felt tense all the way through. It's a gorgeous looking map (2nd edition) and the theme and mechanics are very well integrated. I can't wait to play again!

UPDATE: up to 5 plays now and every one is a bloody, brutal highlight. Thoroughly deserving of its reprint.

Fun group game, pretty good depth while having a very limited set of options per turn (Place two bosses or place one and an immigrant).

And for being little more than cubes and disks and meeples, brings across the theme pretty well too.  (Might be that I love the cover art so much).

Played with three players and it was not that good with three.  I expect it to be a lot better with four or five players.  I have now tried it with 5 players.

One of the few and rare occasions when I can truly say that a heavy Euro game with cubes still feels right on theme. The map looks gorgeous and the flow of the game is very tight and interactive.

Yet another area majority game.

Pros: You may place your influence token in any area. Most area majority games restrict where you can place them.

Cons: Geographical position of the areas have no importance in this game (a pet peeve of mine). 

This is one of those games where if you make a mistake early in the game, you're out of contention for winning (unless someone else makes a disastrous blunder).

The only luck/imperfect information in the game comes from "secondary influence cubes" (for this personal comment, it's easier to use this term rather than what they actually represent) and blind bidding for ties. Secondary influence cubes are placed in the same areas as your influence tokens. If you win an area, you get to control the secondary influence tokens in the same area. If you control the most secondary influence tokens of a particular type, you gain more resources to use for the blind bidding for tied regions (ties occur often, so these resources are important).

This is an exhibition fantastic design.   The rules are so easy to teach and understand that you'll swear that you must be missing something... but the claustrophobic, complex political maelstrom that evolves naturally over the course of the game is a beautiful beast to behold.

Run away leader, king making, leader bashing, and waaaay to long.  Took 2.5 hours to play five players, out staying its welcome by at least 45 minutes.  I can see the game tightening up with more frequent plays, but I would not vote to play again after spending 3 turns trying to catch up to the first Mayor.  The mechanics and negotiation are great, would really like to find a fix the leader and time problems.  Getting 3 additional VP (likely doubling score) and being first to slander means a pretty devastating lead develops early.

RATING: 7
My score of 7 is based on only two games.

This game has a nice 'clean' feel. But it's also a headache, too long for what it is, and can result in a player having little chance of catching up.

I love how simple the rules are. You are fighting over about a dozen spaces on a map by placing meeples and cubes on them. The way cubes are placed means that some spaces become valuable and others are worth abandoning, which becomes important for a lot of your decisions. There is a 'push your luck' element and a fair bit of blind bidding.

It's tidy and tight. The sort of game where everyone knows all of the rules, cards etc after just one play.

But a big problem is the amount of simple math in the game. There's LOADS of it. Unless you can be bothered to do it, you won't be able to 'read' the board at all. About 90% of your thinking will be like this: "I have 7 cubes of that colour on the map but I need 8 cubes because I calculate that Mark will have about 7 across the board and I can beat him by 1, although if Sarah wins a space then she goes up to 9. But if I do put that colour down, it'll give me the respective influence token and that brings my influence tokens in that colour to 1 above any other opponent. But maybe I should prioritise red over blue, as I have 2+4+3 of them already and could still have the majority if ...." etc etc. Sigh.

In our game today two players raced ahead of the other three. The others began to catch up in the last quarter of the game, but only because the two leaders knew it was a 'two horse race' and stopped bothering to put obstacles in front of the other players.

I probably haven't negotiated enough in this game. But I think loads of negotiation would just drag it out even more.

Others compare it to El Grande. I've not played that. But it has some similarities to Hansa Teutonica and I'd always play that over Tammany Hall. Hansa Teutonica has similar 'in your face' area control using cubes, but with almost zero math and a much better 'spacial' feel.

12/16 What a tremendous game, I am a area control/majority fan and it is done really well here, the elections to decide control of regions and the use of political influence in the voting is great. The Winner of the election handing out the variable player powers at the start of each new election cycle is genius, and then a nice dose of negotiation on top of all that.

Mean game though, which means you need people with the right temperament, there were moments of slight conflict in both games I have played of this.

May have a run away loser problem, particularly with 5 players, points are tight and if you make a mistake early it looks like it is really hard to get back in the game.

El Grande may be the better game (just!) But the theme and presentation of this game just sing to me. Top notch

--Oct2010-- Looks delightfully nasty.  I should be able to get this to the table reasonably easily.
--Nov2010-- After one play, a bit disappointing.  There was a strong aura of inevitability about the last half of the game.  Perhaps there's wriggle room there, but we didn't see it.  Now, certainly, better play in the first turn is possible.  But I'd still be worried that the player that (blind) bid the most effectively in the first election might well take the game.
--Mar2014-- I think our trouble was that we didn't explicitly negotiate:  we played it as a classic in-game-signalling Eurogame, and it just isn't.  It might work as an all-in negotiation thing; but that isn't a style of game that appeals to my usual opponents.

moderately accessible Interactive Euro 

Have any internalized racism with regard to the English, the Irish, the Italians, or the Germans? This game will ferret it out! The things that get said in this game can be shocking, taken out of context.

I hated El Grande when it came out all of those years ago--so much chaos, the Castillo memory mechanic, the foolish pasted on theme...I thought it meant that I hated area control. NOT SO! This game told me, within a few turns of playing. Wow, so thrilling, the looking into others' eyes and trying to guess where they'll spend their racial favour tokens.

I suck terribly at this game, can never seem to grasp the bigger picture, get mired into small endless conflicts in the bottom spaces...but I get to extract favours from my political influence and intimate that my fellow politicians have congress with animals and thus may not be fit for office (yay slander cubes), so who cares?!

Played my first game of this 4-player.  Strongly recommend this be played with a full 5-player contingent.  The variable powers handed out by the mayor are interesting and with only 4 it is guaranteed that the "lock two areas" option is going to be set aside every time.  Plus, there isn't as much competition for the wards.

But don't get me wrong, it is still an enjoyable area control game - but different from others as there are multiple goals that can be achieved.  You can't really play too far in advance for your turn as what each player does most likely directly impacts what you will do.

The game plays VERY quickly.  When you start and see there are 16 turns you might expect a long, drawn out game.  Nope.  Each turn you have two choices - place to meeples or place one meeple and one cube.  Rounds 2/3/4 (or 3/4 depending on the # of players) you can also "slander" other players and boot them out of an area.  

Overall - a good game, with the potential for much more with a full house.

The theme is solid -- it feels like I'm whipping the Irish/German/English/Italian mob into a frenzy to support me or slander other ward bosses (players). Simple game to learn and teach, but the chaos makes it impossible to AP over -- which IMO is a good thing.  The game is fun, and has some good mechanics going for it, especially with the Mayor being able to choose who will hold what office positions amongst the other players.

RATING: 7
At its heart this an area control game.  In my experience, this means I am going to be crap at the game.  This game is no exception.  In addition to the area control features, there are also varible player roles.  Interestingly, these are assigned every four turns by the "mayor" which is totally thematic.  These roles have varying strengths that can be of differing benefit to each player depending on the game state.  How these are assigned is a very important part of the game.  

This game really should play relatively quickly but can be easily prone to AP.  If this begins to seep in, then the game will easily overstay its welcome because it does not want to be all that long.

Another problem is that you can easily start to slide into a poor position.  Once this starts, it can be really difficult to reverse the trend and also makes you a tempting target for the stronger players.  But this is also quite thematic.

Overall, this is an interesting game that took a few rounds before we seemed to see how pieces meshed together.  That alone make it worth additional play.  I also think the game may work better with four than five, but I've not played with four so I have nothing to substantiate that opinion. [04/25/2009]

After one play with 4, I think this game is absolutely fucking brilliant, but I'm just not sure yet.  Great theme, lovely board, relatively simple gameplay (although it's easy to miss a few important rules on your first playthrough).  It's very cut-throat, and there's a huge advantage to being in 2nd place vs. 1st. Leader-bashing galore.  Difficult to come back from behind, if you have no currency(influence chips) after the 1st or 2nd election. People get invested in the game and will form vendettas against one another, even when it's not in their best interest (at least in my play group).  Love the roles and the slight jockeying that happens during the assignments.  

Absolutely need to play this more.  I should say that other people in the group loved it.

Tentatively giving this a 7.5, but that will almost certainly increase since I love area control and this game has some tight mechanics.

 excellent production quality and one of the shortest and easiest rulebooks of my collection. Political game on the early development of NY, let's see what it can deliver.

UPDATE> Rating(7)after first game-3 player. The rating is low as:
 . I am generally a (very)lousy player of area control games
 . it was a learning session for all three of us so the game didn't reveal its full potential

 . because of the above there were no negotiations which is the main reason why I bought it

 However, it seemed to be a very good political game indeed, we just now need to play 4-5 sessions to understand the thinking pattern required and confirm it. Another plus is how easy it is to learn and explain and how fast a game finishes.

UPDATE> It is becoming a standard thing for me to dislike area control games. This kind of reminds me the case of King of Siam: excellent game, but I couldn't handle it-the thinking pattern it demanded was not something I could easily bring in my mind. It is exactly the same with TH, and I can now say that since I finally won a game. It is an almost excellent design but no fun for me and if I never play it again, I won't miss it. I will sell it or give it as a present to friends who like it.

Seems like a potentially good game, that gets a lot of depth out of a simple ruleset... I like the bids for domination, because it adds an engaging and interactive human element that is neither predictable or random

however I feel that there is too much to analyze, too much to puzzle through which makes the game really difficult to play intelligently (though if you spend enough time, you can figure it out). So after the first couple of turns there is just so much to count that to play this well that you either have to resign yourself to taking forever (and a day) with every move, or play suboptimally. Playing suboptimally seems like the more fun choice, and I prefer when playing to win and having fun aren't in conflict

RATING: 3.5
Average area majority game with a clever twist (the addition of the immigrant suits to grow power and limit purchasing is great in concept).  Sadly, this game is far too chaotic and prone to caprice for my taste.  It is extremely difficult to make predictions on what other players are going to do and the game is so tactical that often even I didn't know what I was going to do until it was my turn.  

The scoring is all or nothing, there are very few turns, and often you will be challenged based on the folly of other players.  Once you invest a turn you may need to invest another turn to defend it. The huge cost of effectively losing turns encourages players to duke out areas heavily.  This means that often times other regions that were arbitrarily neglected score just as much and the player that wasn't attacked strolls into easy VPs.  

Once you get behind on the token curve you might as well hang up your hat.

Players are required to self balance the system, attacking the leader.  If you neglect to do so then it is a cake walk, if you succumb to that mindset then they person that is attacked the least wins.  It is like the designer thought it was a good idea to port in the worst elements of multi-player war gaming into a bone dry abstract Euro.

Scales well, plays fast, very little luck. What's not to love? Perhaps best of all, it's the most thematically consistent Euro-wood-cube game I've ever played. It all makes perfect sense. "The Irish on the Upper West Side love me, because I helped so many of them to get settled there", or "I might be able to hold on to Ward 7, but I'll have to call in a lot of favors." Just a great game, all around.

Really a delightful game. Fun at 3 but I liked it better at 5. You have to bear in mind which ethnic group you have favors from and where each one is living before placing your ward bosses. Nice multi-layered strategy. I think the weakest element is that it's so easy to pile on the leader but that's ok (they are the leader after all). Simple rules, great tactical play.

I really like the blind bidding element in games like Carson City and A Game of Thrones. Tammany Hall makes this element its central mechanic.
Players vie for control over four different groups of immigrants who want to settle in 19th century New York Cith: the Irish, German, English and Italian. Basically, the political favors of these four groups are the four 'currencies' players can use to bid. You gain political favors by getting these immigrants into one of the 15 districts. This way, you also have control over which 'currency' can be used in each of the 15 battles for control, as you can only bid with political favors of a group who is present in that area.
The game also features a fantastic role selection mechanic, but unlike other games you don't get to select these roles yourself. The player who won the most battles gets elected mayor and gets to appoint these roles to the other players. The mayor scores a lot of victory points, but you also get a big sign on your back. Unfortunately, the roles you get to hand out as the mayor can come in handy to keep you in check.
Our first play was really tense, a true nailbiter. Where to bid, when to bid, how much to bid. A great game, which even exceeded the already high expectations.

RATING: 6
Tammany Hall owes a lot to El Grande, yet it distinguishes itself with more complexity and less luck. There are really two area control games in Tammany Hall. You can't win both all the time, but you can certainly lose them. In this respect, it's like Carolus Magnus, but more dynamic, reactive, and opaque. The leader has to give powerful abilities to everyone else, and they may well collude against him, so he has to balance his enemies against each other. All of it fits the theme perfectly. 

Even so, I'm not sold on this game over El Grande. The added complexity sacrifices intuitive play for depth of strategy. Sometimes that's an acceptable trade, but I'm not sure it is here. That's because the metagame rather than pure strategy is still crucial--otherwise you're left with a runaway leader, and if everyone is analyzing everything and playing reasonably well, I'm not sure what it all comes to. There might be too much to analyze for what you get out of it, at least compared to El Grande.

RATING: N/A
I was very very disappointed with this game. Mainly because it's a real king making game. Players can actually do their bests but eventually the winner will be found because of a third party's actions. I hate games like this and especially when this flaw comes so obvious. 
It's a classic euro style game with cubes and discs with a pasted theme on it.

Another absolute evidence in the game is how players don't have any escape if they make any mistakes. There's no catch-up mechanism, the player(s) who starts better in the game will almost for sure win it and those who made a few mistakes or (much more important) were pushed away by an unfortunate coincidence of shots against by 2/3 players will definitely not win. In fact, the best thing they should do in such a situation is to renounce the game and give up, not interfering in victory.

I played this game once, I don't think I will ever play it again and I had a very bad experience from the first quarter of the game 'till its end.

Maybe the worst player should pick up his role first and after him the second worst and so on. It's not very thematic but then again, so isn't the game.

Gorgeous board and box (Peter Dennis at his best) and excellent Warfrog kind components.

Area majority game with a lot of take that -  I don't love it though, a little too much min/max for my tastes combined with a blind bid. Also easy to be out of the game early by a bad turn. The influence bonus for immigrant dominance reinforces this. Maybe should play again to see if I am wrong but not a fan

The game is nicely produced, however not colour blind friendly in fact the board looks like a brown blob.

Many friends like this game so maybe should give a second chance

Since it is an area control game, it is a bit confrontational and people tend to get a bit upset when others "attack" them, while at the same time attacking others. Also, if somebody is in the lead you need to attack that person or he or she will lead by too much by the next round, and at the same time you need to watch out for people who try to slip under the radar. So there will be a lot of discussion about who should be attacked. Actually, I don't think I want to play this again.

(Pre-third edition) One play; and I really like this game! Area control and collecting votes and then hidden bidding to increase your votes means that this is a game that is right up my street. It plays better face-to-face, but is out of print, so it looks like the easiest way to get a game is on slothninja.com.

Update: It does require the players to balance it which usually annoys me in AT games and perhaps this will in time, but for now, it's a very clever game which is light on rules, but heavy on interaction and choices.

It doesn't work as well with 4 as there is just not enough competition for being immigrant leaders and it's too easy for player to just settle for one each. The roles aren't entirely balanced either and so if the scores are close, one player does benefit more than the others.

Rating down from 8.2 to 7.7.

Really enjoyed this.  The mechanics are engaging and simple yet some how manage to capture the historical political theme really solidly.  The area control aspects are extremely player driven giving away to both friendly negotiation and backstabbing.  The components are lovely, I adore the bowler/top hatted meeples and racial disks.  All and all a very solid title.  Play time runs a little long for what it is, but it's certainly not as bad as some games as you are actively occupied by all the things going on.  Most of the play time I found is due to analysis paralysis, this is not a game for those who are slow players due to this.  Every action can have multiple outcomes and swing based on the choices of everyone else, so over thinking things can be a downside.

RATING: 8.3
Criminally underrated, I find that I appreciate it more and more with each play.  Deceptively simple, abundant in critical decisions, ultimately torturous in way that other games need twice the mechanical complexity to achieve.  

And no, this game is not about a "race war", as it has been accused of being by individuals who I can only presume have never played it. It is a nasty game, however, both in terms of its player-player interaction and its theme, which does involve the exploitation of different nationalities of immigrants, poor and vulnerable, on behalf of the wealthy, powerful, and corrupt. In other words, it's an historically accurate portrayal of municipal politics in the United States. Oh, and an extremely fun game to boot.

On paper it looks like a solid and thematic area control game. But it is way to chaotic. The game board changes so much from turn to turn that it is virtually impossible to play strategically. It is almost purely tactical in my eyes. The only strategic part lies in the meta game, in which players point fingers and try to persuade each other to attack other players. In my eyes that is not a fun thing in a boardgame.

RATING: 7.5
Area control is one of my least favorite mechanics, but Tammany Hall was surprisingly enjoyable.  The game is relatively short - only 12 rounds and you get one action per round.  And the actions are fairly straightforward - either place 2 of your guys, or place 1 of your guys and one immigrant.  Then you fight for control of the various districts and favor of the different immigrant populations to earn victory points.  Extra victory points to whoever gets the most votes, but then everyone else gets an added benefit.

I don't have any deep insight, but I found the decisions to be very interesting.  The main way to win districts is by spending favor tokens from the various populations, but you can only spend the tokens if an immigrant of that color is in the district and you have a meeple in the district.  So, with various underhanded schemes, it's possible to either remove someone's meeple or remove an immigrant population so they can't cast their votes.  Very tactical.  We played with 3 and I ended up running away with it, but I think 4 or 5 player would have been better and more cutthroat.

I wanted to like this much more than I did. I like the theme, and the board/bits of the Kickstarter edition are nice. Tammany Hall also has the kind of simplicity and depth I'd normally associate with a Martin Wallace game - players have only two actions each turn, and there are only two possible actions. That keeps things moving along, but the choices are still tough and the experience rich. You sense a "but" coming, yes? But ... Tammany Hall has serious balance issues. The rich get richer (success is rewarded each round) while a player who has a bad round loses board presence and is likely to continue suffering. This is a severe enough issue that a player who gets targeted early can be playing out the string for the full length of the game. In theory, the balancing mechanism is that a player who is behind in points and has weak board presence won't be further picked on. In reality, that player gets targeted even more because he is unable to solidify any positions. has few influence markers and is therefore vulnerable. This needed some additional play testing.

RATING: 5
Fans of El Grande will probably find the Tammany Hall experience to be quite similar.  Instead of El Grande's cornucopia of action cards, Tammany Hall uses a two-step approach to building influence and adds Diplomacy-like dealmaking.  The result should be more strategic.  In actuality, it is simply more bland (a testament to much time was spent balancing the El Grande card decks).  History buffs might enjoy the Tammany Hall theme but it is scant.

I'll be keeping it in my collection as it hits a sweet spot: a quick-playing, easy-to-teach, Euro-based, area-control game with the potential for high political interaction.

Upon further play, I found my first impressions deceived me. I think the game has a flaw: if all players don't team up against the leader, the leader will run away for the win. If all players do this, there's no game.

Really fun game with a fantastic theme, but it's success is completely dependent on the group you play it with. Can be super-cutthroat, so if you play with friends who get their feelings hurt easily, this might not work. On the other hand, if you don't mind a little conflict on your game night, this game is great.

RATING: N/A
My favorite area control game of all time. I love how simple the actions are, but how the politics and metagame emerge out of them. One of my top games. However, while I love it, I don't see it seeing much play as it is a particularly mean game and quite stressful and needs a minimum of three to play.

A simple-seeming game of area influence set in the wards of New York where players attempt to place ward bosses and gain influence among the different immigrant populations in order to manipulate the Mayoral elections and gain victory points. Out of the simple rules you get an amazing amount of player conflict as they turn on one another to take over the different wards.

RATING: 7
Interesting AoC game where you are balancing your influence with certain groups of "immigrants" and then dispersing those "immigrants" in such a way as to gain control of certain areas of the city.

There seemed to be a fairly high level of chaos, and I stumbled into 2nd out of 5, while being fairly convinced I was doing terribly the entire time, but that might have a lot to do with it being a first play for everyone at the table.

The handing out of titles when you become the mayor is an interesting idea, but I don't think there is enough to negotiate with when distributing them, so it just kind of happens randomly.

I'd definitely play again, especially knowing the game better.

This is an intriguing game with much more depth than an initial glance would make you believe. Do _not_ play with an AP player though - this game can and should max out at 90 minutes tops. (At least, the fun does.) Rating may fluctuate after more than one play.

It's a simple game with some really tense decisions. I actually felt physical tension from this game. It's a very low scoring game but that means that someone who has scored is subject to lose the game at a moments notice if someone else manages to sweep through the wards unexpectedly. Should be interesting to play this one some more.

Area control with ways to manipulate majorities in ways that cause major swings in player positions. Turn order is critical. One of my least favorite mechanisms is used, blind bidding with every bidder losing their bid. Add in open negotiation, and the game really bogs down with analysis as multiple options are considered. Very nice artwork, but for my taste the gameplay does not compare favorably to the classic and superior El Grande.

This is a straight up area control game with some special powers thrown in.  Controlling key areas gives you an advantage so there is a little bit of a runaway leaders issue maybe?  The area control genre is one I like, but my direct conflict disability means it is one I will always fail at.

RATING: 8.5
It only took a year and a half for [thing=30645][/thing] to hit the table. Though the game is easy enough to set up, as all the informations are on the board, I did a poor job at this, and I also made a muistake regarding the amount of immigrant cubes that should be in Castle Garden (the correct is number of players plus 2). I say this to keep everyone informed that the game do help a lot the players to do everything right, you just have to pay the proper attention. Once we got the game going, everything fell into place and we had a blast.

The gameplay is simple: each player, in his turn, has three options of actions:

- either put two wards bosses in any area (they can be put in different places);
- or put one ward boss and one immigrant cube (they can also be put in different places). The immigrant cube comes from the Castle Garden, and only it is empty, more cubes come from the bag. The player takes one political favor chip of the people/cube he put on the board.

These two are the main options the player has. The third possibility (that the players can't use in the first four rounds/years) is to use the slander chips.

- to use a slander chip the player chooses an area of the board, and pays one favor chip of a type there is on the chosen area (so, if in the are there are italians and irish cubes, the player can use one of either of these). Then he removes one ward boss of the chosen area. The player can, then, extend the slander into an adjacent area, by paying two more favor chips of the same type he paid in the first area, and the adjacent area must have cubes of the same people. An ward boss is also removed by the player in this second area.

The game runs for 16 years (each year is a round), and in the end of every four years period, occurs an election. The election is, first, a scoring time, for every area of the board. In every contested area (one with ward bosses of more than one player) will happen a closed bidding: players my bid any amount of favor tokens of people in the area (so, you can't use, say, irish favors if there aren't irish cubes in the area) and every chip will count a 1 vote, and each ward boss also count as 1 vote. The player with the most votes win the area. All the ward bosses in the place, except [b]one[/b] of the winner (if the winner have more than 1 boss in the area, they leave also), are taken out. In case of a tie, all the ward bosses of everyone are taken out.

The information of how many favor chips every player has is open, but the amount bid is hidden until revealed. It is allowed to made deals with players - like "don't bid here, and I don't bid there, so you can use these english favors against him".

So the dispute in the areas follow some arrows in the board, and first the areas in Region I are decided, then those in Region II and finally those in Region III. When playing with less than five players, some regions won't be open until some point during the game. It is important to be aware of the direction the areas will be disputed because you can find yourself battling in several places were you only can use, say, your italians political favors, and you might have to decide to let one or more go, to win others, with more interesting cubes/people.

After the control of all the areas is decided players score 1 point for every area - except the Tammany Hall area, which is worth 2 points. Then, the player that won in the most areas becomes the [b]Mayor[/b], gaining 3 extra points. There are a series of tie-breakers if there is a tie for the most areas controlled (first, the player with most favor chips, then the one with the most irish favors, and so on). The Mayor also has an very important job: distribute functions for the other players, and they are:

- [b]Precinct Chairman[/b]: each turn (year) the player can move one immigrant cube from one ward to an adjacent - it cannot be the last cube in the area;
- [b]Council President[/b]: may "lock up" up to two wards (no more than one each turn). No ward bosses nor immigrant cubes may be added or taken out of a lock up area;
- [b]Deputy Mayor[/b]: each turn the player gains one favor chip of his choice;
- [b]Chief of Police[/b]: may remove one immigrant cube of one ward each turn (year) - it cannot be the last cube in the area.

These offices are pretty great, every one of them and their existence is a smart move from the designer, as normally the Mayor will be the player ahead (for controlling the most wards and also because of the three extra points), and the offices can he used as a neat catch-up mechanism, as the player with the Mayor doesn't have any special action for four rounds (years), and will have to use lots of talk and persuasion (even when giving the offices) to stay in a good position after his term ahead of the city. But, of course, no deal is binding in [thing=30645][/thing].

Finally, also during scoring, players see who has the control of most cubes of each type of immigrants. Each player controlling each people receives three favor chips of that people. Tied players also receive the three chips.

The game runs for 16 rounds (or 16 years), and, thus, there are four scoring/elections. At the end, the player with the most points wins!

[thing=30645][/thing] showed itself as a mean, even vicious game, and tons of fun, with tension and conflicts filling the game time to the brim. Cursing like a sailor hitting the pinky toe while walking to get water at night were usual, almost every time someone put a cube or a ward boss, specially after the 5th year (for the first four years there are room for almost everyone), as disputes will be the norm in several wards. This happens because the game is pretty fluid when considering control of wards: an "safe" area may be lost by adding a single immigrant cube, allowing someone to bid big in there - so, from "safe" to basically "lost" in half an action. This also occurs with the ward boss, as everyone of them works as an "I'm interested" sign, or just a deceit to cost you some favor chips. If I add the slander chips, well, then things get simply evil, as this can take someone out of the contest directly, no matter how many favor chips he/she has. Wicked stuff, man.

In spite of the simplicity of rules and actions, there is great depth in the gameplay, as not only to choose what to do (2 ward bosses and 1 ward boss and 1 immigrant), but also the game as a whole: which immigrant is available, how is the situation of the wards, who is fighting with who, what is the office everyone has, how many favor chips everyone has and of which type, which immigrants are in every area (to dispute for majority of people to gain three extra chips), the order in which the wards will be disputed. All of this has a weight, and one that is constantly changing, calling for almost incessant reevaluation. Therefore, you need to play the players and be always aware ([i]unagi[/i]) of what is happening on the board and outside of it.

The components are beautiful, truly top-notch. Playing time stayed a little above the 90 minutes (around 2 hours), but we did had some AP (read the paragraph above to understand why).

So, to sum it up, [thing=30645][/thing] is a finely crafted game of area control and influence, with lots of possibilities and depth - definitely not a game you will solve, or have a broken strategy, as the game state is ever changing and is player-driven. The theme exsudes from the gameplay and the bits - we played by the sound of the Gangs of New York soundtrack, and everyone was pumped up.

Most surely recommended.

KS version (not backed). This is mainly an area control game. It plays pretty smoothly and is well-produced (if not very attractive). I have a number of problems with it though.

The gist is that on your turn you place either two ward bosses, or one boss and one immigrant, on the map. There are 15 spaces. When you place an immigrant, you also get a chip of the same color. Bosses count as votes inherently for you, but only in the ward they're in, and excess bosses (>1) and losing bosses are lost each "term" (four turns, a quarter of the game). Chips can be spent as additional votes, but only in wards where there is at least one immigrant of that color. Spending chips is a blind bid where even losers pay.

The blind bid is the most apparent mechanic outside of the area control. It's a terrible mechanic. Generally losers wish they had not bid anything, so that if everyone perfectly guessed (deduced) what others would bid, the result would be that only one player would ever bid anything. But that means chips would mostly stay in the game, which is probably not the expected result based on the playtesting.

The adjacency of wards mostly doesn't matter. I don't know how it [i]ought[/i] to matter, but it contributes to making the game feel awfully simple.

The winner of the most wards in a term gets to be mayor, and bunch of extra points. Mayors have no special powers but must allocate powers to the other players. (The allocation decision is rather uninteresting and unpolitical as you can pretty much give the weakest player the best power, and so forth; only one or two of the powers seems especially great anyway.) This makes it seem like a game where leaders get rewarded but then fall behind as they are bashed and lack perks that the other players get. It does somewhat work like that.

However, it seems to me that dominance in an immigrant color (of which there are four) is prone to stagnation, and especially in a five-player game one player can find himself totally impotent. If you bring in a lot of orange immigrant cubes, you will get a lot of orange chips; when you win a lot of wards with orange cubes in them, you get even more orange chips. Furthermore it seems that as the game goes on, most wards end up having all four colors of cubes in them. So if you're not strong in any color, you increasingly can't compete anywhere.

I like the player colors (red, unpainted, yellow, purple, black) but the immigrant colors are really iffy. The "white" are pale mint green, but there's also a lime green. The blue color is a nice sky blue, but the orange one doesn't stand out well, as the board itself is rather orange.

RATING: 8
Very cool game.  Cutthroat and interactive, but just seems to be more fun than vicious like some cutthroat games can be.  Theme is very well integrated.  It just seems even though you are being cut down and attacked by your political rivals, there is always that sweet revenge...

Also no dice or card drawing, so luck factor is for the most part out of the game, which also makes for a less frustrating cutthroat game.  Nothing is worse then getting backstabbed, and out lucked in the same turn like in some games.

A good game with a great theme, but not one I particularly enjoyed playing.  I favour engine-building games (Dominion, Race for the Galaxy and San Juan) which provide some subtle means of messing with other players but not much opportunity for targeted attacks.

I love the theme more than the game. It's a mean-spirited area control game where players bid influence for control of mid-ninteenth century NYC. That's great, but the downside is that there is little in the design to prevent players from perpetually abusing the players farthest behind. After about 30 plays, 5 player games felt very unstable, but overall the design needed a mechanic to compel the leader to struggle a bit more to maintain their hold, instead of relying on the table to unify in punishing them (see Martin Wallace's Liberte)

After one play I'm a little disappointed. There are many good things going on. But if you fall behind, you are out of the game essentially. There is not that much of a "runaway leader" rather than a "one mistake and you're out" Problem. To win wards, you need discs, to get discs you need to control the majority of a color, which you gain by controlling a lot of wards...
And there's worse. Once you fall behind on discs, you are a potential target, since you can not fight to hard.
So overall, a very meehhh feeling.
I will try and bring this to the table again with 3. Maybe other dynamics occur. Hopefully they will, since the other mechanics are really neat and I think this could shine (or could have)

Pretty bland.  Another area control game.  Feels sort of like a watered-down, less original and compelling version of Martin Wallace's [gameid=2507].  I didn't get a lot of feeling of the theme.  I want the theme to be more than "these cubes are Italians, these are Germans" and a few offices to assign to players that feel like a weak catch-up mechanism.  The theme must have been ditched early in the design process in favor of mechanics, and the game suffers for it.  I want more rough edges, more simulation, and less of a dry grind for VPs.

Very cutthroat, brain-burning, area majority game where every action is inevitably a direct attack on or threat to at least one other player with 5 players. Could possibly be unbalanced: With 5 players, 3 or 4 players may quickly establish a "safe" majority in each of the 4 nationalities leaving the other 1 or 2 players to fight for scraps. With 4 players they could possibly just "take" a nationality each and only fight for seconds - I do not know how much fun that would be (I have only tried 5 player).

So, there's area control.  I'm not very good at area control.  There's also negotiation.  I'm not very good at negotiation.

I'm not really sure what led me to believe that this would be my kind of game.

No wonder this was a grail game for a time. Gameplay has all of the simplicity of El Grande but manages to deliver the negotiation and back-stabbing of something like Spartacus Blood and Treachery...and it does it with almost no randomness. It's some kind of mad alchemy that this game even works.

It's a particular stroke of genius that instead of a set catch-up bonus assigned to the loser, the game relies on the leader to hand out a game breaking power to everyone behind him. Essentially, the leader has to arm those behind him with the tools to take him down. It's a fantastic wrinkle.

My group isn't experienced enough yet to really make for meaningful negotiations, but those are there on the horizon. I can see them coming. When they get here, this game is going to rocket up my list of favorites.

A good area control game that reminded me a lot of El Grande.  Lots of flavor and theme, but available information slowed down the game a bit.  

Also, has a bit too much "rich get richer."  If you do well in a round, you are likely to have a better than average starting position on the board for the next round plus have more influence disks than other people as a result.  This, of course, sets you up to do well in the next round.

Man did I ever want to like this game!  Beautiful components, great theme, but after two games I'm left with the impression that one or two players (depending on whether you play with 4/5) is/are always going to get left behind after the first round, with an extremely small chance of ever catching up.  Anyways, I could go on, but many other comments in the 4s, 5s, 6s  ratings for this game have already said what I want to say, and probably more eloquently. 

I'd rather be playing Quebec  (really underrated game) or El Grande, and I plan on trying Liberte soon.

I really like this game. I think it's a great game overall, with a good flow, but there are two things about it which, for me, push it up to a 10 from the 8/9 that it might otherwise settle at.

The first is that I just really like the theme. The whole political machine thing really works on me, and the art and play style seems inline with what the theme is trying to go for. It's one of those games that feels the same above board as on board. I love Agricola for instance, and the artwork and choices do give a feeling of farming in a loose cartoony sense, but the above board player interaction always breaks that feeling. With TM, the whole experience feels like a political gambit.

The second is that it fits my playstyle and the playstyle of the people I hang out with. I'm pretty relaxed about the cooperation/backstabbing that occurs in games, so I can usually whip through a game without hard feelings.

Nice area control/majority game with some negotiation tossed in. A bit unforgiving; in our first play two people were permanently behind the whole game after a bad first term, I'll chalk it up to a learning game. Simple rules and good looking components, even though there are only two actions there is a good amount of planning going on. Offices open up more strategic play and the fact that the mayor hands them out is a nice twist. Played surprisingly well with 3. Very tight design. Still haven't seen any negotiating but that may come with 4-5 players a little easier.

This has quickly become my very favorite area control game and I seem to like it equally well whether people are solely playing for their own best benefit or are making strange alliances to help kingmake each other to victory.

More thinky and less chaotic than Mission Red Planet, I have successfully used this game as an introductory game thanks to its simple set of rules.  It seems to have a bit of a runaway leader issue - but that might just be with my group!

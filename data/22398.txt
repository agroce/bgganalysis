Very basic strategic game. Good for all ages and helps with geography. One of my favourite light games.

Always worth a play but suffers from being slightly complicated compared with the other three. At its best when pure vanilla - e.g. Africa.

I like this one as much as 10 days in Africa.  It's basically a geography lesson for the kids, but it's a good geography lesson.  This is not a gamers game by any stretch.

RATING: 7
A good, solid filler; games lasting somewhere between 10 to 30 mins.  Large dose of luck as some cards/tiles are far more valuable than others as there have many more connections (cf Cyprus with Russia).

Quite addictive; even my non-gaming wife can be sucked in by this one,

Note: It should really be called 10 days in Asia and the Middle East (but I suppose this would be a mouthfuuuul) and even the new name wouldn't help explain why Cyprus is in the game!

It's not really educational (beyond learning the positions of various countries), because although the capital city, population and land area (in sq miles yet!  Obviously catering to the American audience) of each country is listed, these are not referred to in the game, and are pretty much ignored. Indeed the population and area information is obscured when your tiles are in the rack (where they spend most of the game)

The trains take a bit of getting used to, but I like the bigger board.

Just like the other "10 Days" games, has a high luck factor, but the trick is to keep your options open and give yourself maximum flexibility.  If you're stuck waiting for one specific tile, you've lost yourself the game.

I like the addition of the railroads.  I also enjoy that this version has railroads, planes, and boats, in addition to being able to walk to adjacent countries.  I find it makes the game more enjoyable, and gives for a lot more options when trying to finish out routes.

Great little connection game - somewhat harder to build connections than in Afirca or Europe will mean this one may appeal more to gamers...  great little game - good for geography!

I tried the Europe version recently and liked it.  I thought I might find Asia more interesting since I don't know it as well.

A nice balance of luck and randomness against tactics, memory, and a fast playing time.  If it were any longer it would cease to be fun.  As it is, it's a quick game to play over a meal.

RATING: 7.5
Another good 10 Days game.  The connections feel a bit more restricted in this one - it takes a little more time to think moves through than the other 10 Days games.  

After another few plays, I think this may be the best in the series.  The RR + ship + plane + adjacency options feel like they really open up the options - perhaps this one might actually be good with 3-4 players? (the others seem to play much better with 2)

RATING: 8
Incredibly well-designed and simple filler / gateway game that has worked with every group of players we've tried it with.  The travel / geography theme goes over well and it offers a nice challenge without too many rules or too long a play time.  An excellent example of a game that leads people to say: "Ooh, can we play another round of this."  Never seems to overstay its welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the best of the 10 Days in... games which to some people might be the worm with the best jumping ability, but I think these games are pretty fun.  This edition introduces trains, which adds a whole extra strategic layer, bringing it up to one strategic layer.  Like most 10 Days in... games it has one terrible card, in this case, Maldives.  If you manage to win with Maldives in your hand, you might as well quit playing games because you've peaked.

This game is different enough from the others that it is worth owning this one and potentially one other game.  If you're unsure which other one to get, I would recommend the one with Burkina Faso.

RATING: 4
Components: Same component quality as the others in the series. The shape of Asia doesn't lend itself easily to the shape of a game board; some of the countries as just tiny blobs on the map.

Experience: Basically the same as the others in the series, so not really worth the purchase if you already have another. Though I never drew a railroad tile in my one playing, I like the idea of them. I'd be interested to see an abstracted connection map for this game, to see how it contrasts to the others, because it feels much stranger than Africa or USA. Russia connects countries on different sides of the board; China seems to touch almost everything; and other countries are trapped in the ocean.

Rated low only because I wouldn't reach for this over the US edition.

7/10: seems a bit more fiddly than 10 days in USA, but the trains and oceans add a bit of a twist.  Princess likes learning the Asian geography-my brother and family are in Jakarta, Indonesia and Annie is from the Philppines, so the map makes this 'real' for the Princess.

RATING: 8
The trains add an interesting component to the 10 Days series.  The size of the map, and the extreme variation in country sizes makes for a bit of a difficult game until you learn the geography, but it's worth it.  My favorite of the 10 Days series.

Mmm, train game kinda. This "10 days" version does have some interesting quirks with the tiny countries that are hard to get into & out of nestled alongside giants. That makes getting a few giants key and the and you'd better get some boats if you've got a lot of the small countries.

Clever and new approach to game play. Reminded me of playing Ticket to Ride; both rely on efficiently crossing a map and both have a dozen maps to play on. The main difference is that Ticket to Ride feels like a game and 10 days in XXX feels like something I would have played when in school.

Same as the other 10 Days varieties, although with the addition of trains.  The main problem is that it has sacrificed some gameplay ease for geographical accuracy.  Too many of the countries are tiny little places that are difficult to find, let alone figure out how they connect to other countries or oceans.  The idea is great, but the execution in this incarnation needs work.

RATING: 10
I give this such a high rating because it is an educational classic for Americans, and also my husband has latched onto this, one of the few games he actually enjoys.  It's nuaunces make it different enough from the 10 Days in Africa. It has more tiles and takes a little longer to play.  With 2 people our games last from 5-20 mins.  another player can double the time.  
     After playing fifty games of Asia we pulled out Africa and played it again--we feel Asia is much better. 
     At over 1000 plays this game is holding up well.  Have wiped the tiles down a few times with alcohol and still in excellent condition---well, except for the wood tile holders which all came warped. Out of the Box replaced them immediately--great company.

I wondered when this would happen!! On game #1,012 my husband won by completing his 10 Day journey before taking his first turn!  That was a 2-minute game!  Or you could say the game ended before it began.  Happened again on game #1,553 by husband!

Highly durable game--At 1553 plays--only one tile slightly damaged & the board holding together well, although may have to duct tape the back in another 100 plays.  Also, a game has always ended before running out of tiles.

On 10/6/02010, after 1540 plays, duct taped the back of the board in two places.  (This is interesting.  Somewhere along the line BGG dropped some recorded plays for this game.  See the note above.  I didn't date it, but that was some time ago.)

In all these 1600+ games my husband & I have played, someone has always finished their trip before we have made it through the draw pile.

Best of the series.

RATING: 8
One of my wife's favorite games (along with Pandemic.) At first, I thought this was a "luck of the draw" game -- and there's certainly a bit of that -- but I've noticed that there is a fair amount of strategy to initial tile placement. Also, the drawing mechanism (which allows for drawing from one of four stacks of tiles, three of which are face-up) had me crunching numbers and counting tiles. When people say poker is luck, the comeback question is, "Well, why do all the same people win international tournaments every year?" 10 Days in Asia is a bit like that. If it's all luck, why does the same person seem to win more often than not?

RATING: 5.264
Only a few plays only, but quite a reasonable game  (9/1/10).  UPDATE: The more I play it, the less enamored I get.  Too much luck to make the downtime of value.  It's still enjoyable in terms of the frustration of getting the cards, and something to hook newbies in with, so a worthwhile addition to a collection, but I don't feel It's a long term stayer - rating reduced by 1 to 6 (14/5/10). UPDATE: I try to like this game, and give it additional plays, but it just does not really appeal. Card play is light, and you are at the whim of the cards. There is also a bit of down time as you wait for others. The more I play, the more annoyed I get with the board layout - ultimately, i find it poor, as whilst map wise It's correct, this means that there are these clumps of tiny countries which I find hard to read when laid out for four on a larger table, you just can't see the linkages easily.  In fact, it would be best just to give each person a colour A3 of the map so they can clearly see, draw, and make notes about the game. By the strict definition of BGG, It's now regraded down by 2 to a 4 (Not so good; it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion). I don't expect this ranking to change, as there just are better games to play. Still, I got 10 plays out of it, so it has been a utilised game (May 2013). UPDATE:  Previous rating was a bit harsh.  Would still play it if asked (Rating 5.264, Sept 16).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fun set collecting game, and filler.  There is luck in the draw but the game is not void of decisions.  Creating itineraries that have the greatest number of possibilities is key, and so is knowing when to abandon a set plan.  Timing and risk taking fall into place, and the quick length make this a winning design in my book.  The addition of actually learning geography is a plus, and it doesn't have the feel of an educational game.  This one is a bit more of a brain burner than Africa or Europe, as there are two distinct sides of the map and a heck of a lot of small countries with limited access.   Asia is currently third on my preferred list of 10 Days games, but with more exposure could possibly become the favorite.

adds trains to the mix.

Another of the short, easy-to-play, fun-to-play-even-if-you-lose games in the "Ten days" series.  Oceans and trains produce quite a different balance from say "10 Days in Africa" or "10 Days in the USA".  Simple to learn.  Finding all those ex-USSR states takes a little while.  The "10 Days" series are great for teaching geography.  Thoroughly recommended.

Latest game in the "10 Days" series of games shows the experience of the earlier versions in the design.

The colour layout doesn't appear any more difficult than the other versions, but finding the countries to match into your gaps is somehow harder, even with the nice non-colour specific transportation choices of Railroads and Oceans.

I'm rating this a 6.5 based on one play (a solo, 3-player "40 days Around the World" variant), but I suspect that Asia and Africa might climb a little with more plays; uncertain about Europe (also currently a 6.5).

Almost a multi-players solitaire given there is very little player interaction. Be the first to place 10 hidden cards in a row that form a 10 day trip through Asia. Basically a game of drawing and discarding onto three piles, the only strategy involved is planning for best probability in forming your card line and perhaps blocking cards others may find attractive by discarding onto them. Same feel as building a jigsaw puzzle.

A good update of Rack-O with a geography twist. The game is probably best when playing with kids aged 10-14, but there's enough here for adults as well. Gotta stay flexible and be ready to make wholesale changes to you game plan at any time!

Of the 3 I have played (Africa, Asia, Europe), Asia is the best. It gives four options for connecting rather than three. Instead of this making it easier to connect, the additional option of rail creates a new decision point that makes this slightly more interesting and challenging than the other titles.

RATING: 5
[>5 plays for the series] This is a very light game that is easy to teach and learn. A good choice for quick filler (<15 minutes in most cases) or for non-gamers. High educational value for young ones. This version retains the boats of the Europe version and adds railroads for a neat change of pace. See also: 10 Days in Africa, Europe, and USA.

RATING: 8
The whole series succeeds as a light diversion at the end of a game night or a quick game to start with. In comparison to the other games of the series that I know I would give the following ranking:
1. Europatour (German version of 10 Days in Europe)
2. 10 Days in Asia
3. 10 Days in Africa
I like the introduction of railroads instead of cars (Africa) which made Africa too easy for my taste. On the other hand, the Asia map has to many countries with only one or two land connections which increases the luck factor in card draws noticeably. This is solved better in Europe. Only drawback for Europe (German version) is that it doesn't contain multiple cards for central destinations as Germany.

My least favorite in the 10 Days series that I have played so far. The addition of the Railroad transport type may have been necessary due to the number of isolated countries, but it unbalances the percentage of Transport versus Country tiles in the game.

[b]10 Days in Asia[/b]

[i]I have enjoyed the different 10 Days games I've played more than I thought I would, but the Asia map is probably my least favorite. I really don't like the bottlenecks that exist on this map; there can potentially be a lot of dead ends on this map. Also the map is basically cut in 2 by one country unless you use a boat or plane which makes you feel like you have very limited options on some of your turns. Our game devolved into everyone looking for a specific boat turn after turn without being able to change anything on our racks without having to replace a lot of tiles. I did enjoy the game, but I'd rather play any of the other maps over this one[/i]

RATING: 9
Update (02/04/17):
Had a quick 2 player game and decided that I very much enjoy playing this game, despite losing the game within the first 6 turns to my wife. I like how there are several layers of strategy to the game starting from where to put the tiles as you first pick them. Then which tiles to pick up, be it from one of the 3 discard piles, or a hidden one from the top of the draw deck. Deciding which discard pile to cover up is an important decision point as well as you do not want to give your opponent(s) a good tile that they might have passed up on. 

So in essence this game as really simple rules but so much strategic thinking to offer that I've decided to bump my rating up by 2 points. Definitely a star in my collection.
~

Gf loves it. I love it. All is well. 

In short, excellent filler/non-gamer game that is couple friendly and educational as well.

Feels a bit like mahjong especially when left with one last tile left to complete the set. Even more exciting when everyone's waiting for their last tile.

Hope to try it with more players

*Update* 4 player game last night had everyone waiting for a certain tile. Nice, slow casual filler that is not too brain burning, perfect for starting or ending an evening of gaming with.

Different geography, same game, same process as the original. Here it's slightly harder to get connections because of their specificity - there's no generic boat card for example, you must get 1 of the restricted specific ocean cards required. Railroads connecting various countries make up for it though and assist in making connections throughout the spread geography manageable. The other noticeable difference was the increase in deadend countries, with only 1 or 2 exits, which makes the discard pile similar from game to game and puts a premium on getting the bid countries like China, India, Russia. An increase in luck perhaps, but it was already largely luck based. Anyway, there's no need to own different versions of this series - they're all playable in a family type setting but none are significantly better than the others.

This is my favorite of the series. Fun, Simplistic, yet Strategic Hidden Route-Building Game using 4 modes of transportation. Educational, and kids still enjoy this game. A good time for gamers and lesser mortals alike. The games don't take forever. Someone said that this is Rack-O with geography, but it is much better than that. Very good production. I'd have kept the game, but I was the only one who requested it.

The names of the countries can be a stumbling block for some players.

Another good entry in the "10 Days.." series.  I like the addition of railroads.  But, I don't think combining the Mideast and Asia in this game works -- they should each have their own version, as you most likely will build your trip EITHER in the Mideast or Asia and likely not both, plus the Mideast countries are mostly geographically smaller and hard to see on the map.

No change in the mechanics, though the box depth has changed, probably due to the 6 panel board (so more oblong than the first 2 releases?).

It is effectively Rummy, but that is a good thing! It makes the game accessible to everyone from children to grandparents, and it means player can focus on the fun part of building their routes. Everyone feels as though they make progress, and you can't help but learn some geography. Luck certainly plays a part, but there is scope for clear thinking and tactical play. Boardgames Australia awarded it Best International Game 2008.

Probably the hardest of the 10 Days bunch.  The longitudinal nature of Asia makes for an interesting and slightly more difficult trip creation process.  I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to playing it some more!

I decent "rummy style" game that is enjoyable to play. With good planning and observing what your opponent(s) pick up, you will find that there is some real strategy going on here. It is balanced well against the luck of the draw. Simple game, that seems to improve with repetition. OUT-OF-THE-BOX publishing is proving to be the little engine that could!

My six year old has all of a sudden taken a shine to this - hence 8 plays in 3 days after only 2 in two years previous.  Excellent geography and lateral thinking (keeping mind open to multiple options rather than the most obvious one) lesson for kids.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My favorite of the 10 Days... series of games. Might be because there are 3 forms of transportation in this one (boats, planes and trains) while the others only have 2 in each. I especially enjoy the connectivity of the rail lines. 

These games really work well as two player games. With more players, it's a little more likely that you won't get access to any specific tile. Of course, it's best to not leave yourself in the position of needing one specific tile. The initial draw of tiles at the begining of the game is very interesting. I like to put a tile with alot of borders in the 2nd position if I can. Starting with alot of transport tiles can make for a quick win. Sometimes I play extra quickly in the initial draw just to get the first choice from the discard stacks.

Great way to learn geography!

RATING: 5
While it is an enjoyable activity to play with my wife, it's not really a strategy game.  Most of the game is spent waiting for specific tiles to appear, either in discard piles or from the draw pile.  This game is more fun thinking about where you would like to go visit in real life than actually trying to complete the 10 days first.  A few times playing getting to know the geography also makes the game more pleasant to play.

Harder than USA or Africa with the railroads and the Steamships replacing the cars.  Also has a lot of little countries that are not connected to much.

RATING: 6
Another 10 Days. Draw a card, hope you win. The railroad cards are a nice twist. Components are a bit bland, but I guess the board would be rather busy if they weren't.

This is a good chance to argue politics and make a few enemies. The West Bank and Gaza Strip are on the map. Soon to be parking lots, etc.

Update: Improving with more play. But I can't see it getting any better than a 6, seeing as there's only one copy of most cards. At times it feels like playing mahjong with most of the tiles missing. Railroads etc help, but not quite enough.

Great simple ruleset but leading to a whole bunch of options with the tile combos and some fairly enjoyable decisions.

More depth than I thought after reading the very simple rules.  Could play with kids (and offers a geography lesson as a bonus) and offers a surprising depth of play - not heaps, but more than expected and it can be quite tenses.  A light game, very enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Mahjong/Rummy-like game with a (pretty good) theme! Draw or retrieve a tile a turn, then discard a tile, while trying to arrange your tiles into a legal travel itinerary across Asia. This game's pretty tense with 2 players, and a new mechanism opens up. The game's luck-dependent, but the experience, tough decisions and learning of geography is worth it. 

Good for non-gamers who will never like games, no matter how gateway.

3+2

RATING: 7
Yet another game in this excellent series of games.  To me, they all have the feel of connection games, which I am sure adds to their appeal for me.  I think the addition of the rail lines is an interesting change from the other games in the series as it gives this game more options for connections.  This is a good thing, as there are a LOT of countries to connect.  So many that my initial thought was that there were too many.  I no longer beleive that.  I will point out that there are some challenging areas on the board, which, to me at least, is a good thing.  All in all, a game I am very happy to have finally (after some delay) been able to obtain.  [01/19/2008]

Played once with 4P. This is an excellent educational tool for learning the locations of countries, especially those found in Central Asia and the Middle East.

Possibly the best in the series as there are multiple cards for some countries, there are rail and sea connections. Not sure if this is different enough from the other games to warrant a purchase if you own the other sets.

10 Days in Asia is my first and only foray into this series of games (if you don't count good old Racko), and I have to say that I liked it! It works great for us as a light 2-player strategy game to end the evening. Haven't tried it with more yet. It has a nice element of luck, making it suitable for mixed groups of people (children   adults, serious gamers   casual gamers, goths   punks, and so on). It's very attractive, but one error stands out - it isn't very color-blind friendly. I had to use a sharpee to mark appropriate tiles and countries on the board so that I could use symbols instead of relying on the terrible color choices. The colors are pretty, mind, I just can't distinguish some of them. I wish more game publishers would take color-blindness into account when making design decisions. - Initial rating.

If you like puzzles and want to learn some basic Asian geography as painlessly as possible, check this one out.  Perfect for family gatherings or lunch hours.  I plan to get all the others in the series for primarily educational reasons.  This may horrify some, but hey, I like to learn stuff.

The new stuff: train cards (several routes drawn on the board; can use a train card on any of them, to travel from any country on the route to another), and cruise ships (Pacific and Indian Oceans) which allow travel from coastal country to any other coastal country in the appropriate ocean. I unfortunately hadn't realized there were still planes in this game, and so didn't mention them. Both others assumed they could be used to travel ANYWHERE, so we played it out that way! Bob won pretty quickly while I was a good ways off. 

This is a fun game, definitely a worthy continuation of the series and good if you want to play in Asia!

Comparisons to Rack-O are valid, but I always forget how frustrating the Rack-O card exchanges can be and how bad I am at geography.  Those challenges make 10 Days in Asia a gamer-friendly choice that's appropriate for any age range, but this map is often too remote for new players.

Much of the game comes down to the luck of the tile draw, with more than one player just waiting on the right tile being turned up or discarded. Most of the strategy in the game (and your chances of winning) appears to be in the placement of the initial 10 tiles. Initial rating of 5.

10 plays: I still find the game slightly boring but the family likes it. Stays at 5.
20 plays: Still a family favourite but I'm not warming to it. Stays at 5.
30 plays: I guess if I've played it 30 times it must be an OK game with some element of fun. Rating increased to 6.

Some cards are so much better than other cards, and this flaw is serious enough for me to rate it poorly.  Of course, there isn't much of a fix for this, since changing maps just for gameplay purposes is probably not desirable.

Much more interesting than it has any right to be, considering it's a rummy variant with a map.  The alternative transportation cards add just enough spice to keep the game interesting, and it's a very simple game that will go over well with family or as very light filler.

Primarily a card game with a reference board/map since nothing happens on the board/map itself.  The game play feels a bit dry considering its international travel theme, but it really does help one learn geography.  I allow my 6yo daughter to reposition her cards/tiles within her rack which simplifies the game for her.  We play quite regularly and her knowledge of Asian geography has become *amazing*.  Mine too!  A great teaching tool that also entertains.  Highly recommended for being the rare fun teaching tool.

RATING: 7
At heart, [b][i]10 Days in Asia[/i][/b] is an extremely simple game. Players can make their moves with little planning or forethought, and eventually one of them will blunder into victory. If you pay attention to your moves, however, both during set-up and the game itself, your chances of winning will be much higher.

The game plays more quickly with two players than with three, and three is faster than four. With each additional player in the game, you have a greater chance of seeing the card you need picked up from a discard pile or buried. The countries with the most connections, despite being on two cards, will be scarcer as players hold on to those travel hubs and instead dump the obscure spots that are hard to reach. Even with this added competition, the game still plays quickly and typically invites a "Let's play again" reaction from both gamers and casual players, with no passport needed...

Not a game to pull out regularly but a good diversion now and then, and it's quick enough to get in a couple plays at a time.

Not a whole lot going on here, just collecting and ordering sets of cards, but it's OK as a family game. I have a soft spot for geography games even though it's not a genre full of hits.

Extremely fast to play (with rules teaching the game only took 30 minutes).  Although it takes very little strategy, there are definitely difficult decisions you would encounter periodically as to what to keep and what to discard (sometimes it even require one to play defensively so as not to throw out something valuable for your opponents to pick up).  The geography aspect appeals to me, but since it is no more than a filler, the production value is only adequate.

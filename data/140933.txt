RATING: 5
Solidly tactical, it has a great spatial piece to it. Best at either 2 (in terms of denying your opponent something you perceive them to be after) or, more likely, 4 (so that the most dice come out). For a dice game, I find the desire to try and read fellow players to be much higher than I find in something like Discoveries or Nations TDG. A game that I'd be willing to play it someone else brought it, but I don't think I'd request it necessarily. That it plays in 30 minutes in another solid point in terms of dice games.

It's a simple game that I believe just came back into print (?). You each get a card that shows a pattern of squares and height. Each round, there's a pool of dice rolled - in orange, green, black and clear. Each represents a 'material' in a building - wood, recycled material (?), stone and glass. What you have to do on your turn is pick a die from the pool and place it behind your screen on this pattern - to build a building, you see? The pattern is a 'blue print' - hence the name of the game.

On your turn you need to pick the right material and place it smartly - so you can score well. Wood scores by having lots of adjacent dice. Recycle is score by having lots in your building. Glass it scored by the die face. And stone by how high you've stacked it. So there's that decision plus trying to complete your blueprint. 

Points are awarded after placing 6 dice. That completes the round. The player who scores the highest gets 3 points, second place gets 2. There's bonus points for completing your blue print and for using certain combinations of dice (like 4 of a kind in your building). After I think 3 rounds, the game is over - highest score wins.

So easy peasy game play. Dice pool is the central idea. I actually thought it was fine for what it was. A good game to play in between games - a filler with some quick fun. It'd be good for yahtzee players too - pretty easy to explain of course and not intimidating at all.

I adore new innovative ways to use dice, which is exactly what Blueprints brings to the table. Despite being a dice fest, Blueprints manages to diminish the impact of sheer luck to an acceptable level, i.e., there is still plenty of room for strategy. Every turn you are contemplating whether to take your most wanted die or block your opponents. Calculating the immediate swing in victory points is usually easy, but at the same time you might be losing the opportunity to score some big points in the future. This makes the decisions meaningful, which is essential for a game to appeal to my taste.
 
As I wrote above, it is usually easy to keep track of the situation in spite of the player screens. You are only taking six dice from the table per round, and at least I was able to remember everything other players took without an effort. There were even situations when I was able to tell my opponent which die he should take. And none of this requires Rainman characteristics from you.
 
For Blueprints to be perfect, it would have needed more rounds or more liberties so that keeping track of everything was not possible. Some push your luck elements would’ve been nice as well. But luckily, a game does not need to be perfect for it to be enjoyable. I would certainly play again. I might even ask someone to bring this to the game night.

RATING: 6
Fun light game unlike anything else in my collection that I can think of. You spend rounds using different dice representing different materials to secretly build buildings that do or do not comform to a randomly dealt blue print. your goal as the "architect" is to create a building that consists of an optimal combination of materials, numbers, and and shapes all represented by the dice you selected during the round that meet specified personal and externally defined objectives that do not match your opponents if they are going for the same thing. A nice pre or post meaty game to play.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I went into this game expecting to find myself stuck in a boring small filler game and I was instead pleasantly surprised. Blueprints is actually an interesting little game that is all about dice drafting, which is a mechanism I really enjoy.

I like how the different kind of dice score in different ways and how the game offers you different objectives to shoot for. This makes every blueprint a little puzzle to solve, since you have to figure out which combination of dice can score you the most points. I also like the fact that these points only matter in order to get the first, second or third place point card, which ensures that nobody can really run away with the game just because of dumb luck.

So... the game-play is interesting and quick, the components are very good quality and the package is very portable. The only negative thing I can say about this game is that I'm not sure how much re-playability it can offer, but, as a game to bring out every now and then, it's a very good one. Thumbs up!

1st play: I enjoyed this game. Trying to build the highest point structure with a changing resources each round is an interesting challenge. It seems 3 is the easiest player count, so it probably plays quite a bit differently with 4. Fast playtime makes it easy to get to the table.

2nd play: Played again with my 5 year old and he liked it. Not a super heavy game and fast enough for his attention span.

Great game, it was one of the first games I played when I was intruduced to the modern board games world (Thanks André, BGG user LABRC)and it wasan unique experience, I had never seen dice been used like that (you know, every dice color represents a different material and has different scoring rules) I thought it was amazing, but I'm not giving it 8.5 based on my first play or out of nostalgia, it is a sucess every time it hits the table, it enthralls new players as well as the eventual passer-by.

I found this to be a curiously annoying game.  On the plus side, it seems to be more complex and interactive than Yahtzee.  And that added layer tended to encourage me to take the game more seriously, but when I did so, I found that quite decisively, my game results, whether I won or lost, were a direct result of random dice rolls.  

Better it seemed, to NOT take the game seriously, and just get in touch with my inner "Yahtzee child."  

But when I did that, I began to think to myself how much more I would rather be playing Yahtzee than this game.

Not sure what I can do with this game except hope those who enjoy this game roll the rolls they need.  Good luck to all of you!  (I will be playing something else.)

Blueprints is a moderately strategic dice-building game with some easy mechanics but fun game play. Drawing the dice from the bag to build up your blueprint feels pretty cool and gives you a sense of accomplishment. The drawbacks that keep it at the current rating ?
1) The rule book is not very well written. We had to check BGG forums quite often to sort it all out. And for a small game like this that's kind of inexcusable. 
2) There are just too many ways to score for such a small game. You score for the different kinds of dice, you score for the blueprint, you score for the prizes, you score for majority in a certain material. That just seems like complexity for complexity's sake. 
 Despite these it is still a good filler. Check it out.

Players create buildings with their dice, but the color and number of them can determine how valuable that building will be. I was totally surprised by this game. It gives you a great combination of strategy and yet still has those moments where you're hoping for a lucky roll of the die. I loved the fact that you could even choose to deviate from your blueprint in order to shoot for bonuses. Perhaps one of the best design ideas in this game is that the slate is wiped clean after each round. Therefore if you have one lousy round you can always have a shot at turning your game around in the later rounds. This is a game I definitely need to get as soon as possible, because I expect my family will love it.

Filler rating.

A game that employs dice to build on a blueprint tableau where you gain points based on whether you followed the blueprint. This is coupled with getting the right dice in the right locations to get points that are on cards that specify criteria for the dice.

This mess of a game fails on multiple levels for me. First, I should mention that I'm not a fan of "3D" spatial mechanics in games generally, which is just a personal preference. 

But what bugged me much more was the scoring, which was simultaneously convoluted and anticlimactic: in one turn a player could generate a spectacularly high score, which ultimately only earned him one or two points. In another turn, a very low scoring could earn him the same number of points. Not very interesting. 

But what I really hate is the "draw dice from the bag" mechanic. Why add a random element to an already really random dice game (which already has randomized cards)? It's one chance-based mechanic piled on top of another, and the whole thing just doesn't work. Sold.

A neat little filler game with some really interesting ideas!  Players build little buildings out of various colored dice, scoring points for following the blueprint and also scoring each die.  Each color of dice scores in various ways.  One color of die scores for being up high, while another color scores for touching a lot of other dice, while yet another just scores whatever the pip value is.

After comparing scores for the buildings, the players with the highest scoring buildings take score cards for the bets buildings, and some other score cards are awarded for meeting certain specifications, such as using a bunch of dice of the same color, same pip value, all different pip values, etc.

After a few rounds, the player with the most point cards wins!

Overall, a neat little game, but I didn't really feel like playing again and again.  I suppose this is fine for a filler weight game though, and I will definitely pull it out when the group is waiting for someone to show up for the night.

A fun simple point salad. The only thing I found that broke the game a little was when the player before you rolled a glass 6, there really wasn't a strong argument why you shouldn't take it. In the earlier game, you could put it in a level 1 space and stick to the building plan. In the later game, unless you could take a 6th green die, or build a level 4-6 black die (which means you'll deviate from your building plan), it would still probably be your best bet.

Had fun with this dice filler that doesn't play like a typical dice game. By playing 3 rounds we got to try different strategies and not always build to the blueprint to see how it shook out. In a 2 player game this strategy seems helpful as it may get you some extra bonus card if the dice roll in your favor. I definitely liked it and thought it was a great 30 minute filler to start or close a gaming session.

The wife wanted something easy to learn, engaging, and low weight (aka - "I'm tired honey and I would rather watch a movie right now, but I will play something but you better chose something appropriate or we won't be doing this again for a while!). 

Enter Blueprints! Up until I played this game I always referred to [thing=70323][/thing] as the next step up from Yahtzee (and I still do). But I also refer to Blueprints as this now too (but waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better!).

I love the scoring mechanism in Blueprints. There are certain objectives (or prizes as they are called) that you can win each round. These prizes are very Yahtzee like - 4 of a kind, long straight, 5 stack tower (since dice can only be stacked on top of dice of equal or lesser value I always imagine that there is at least a short straight in here somewhere, or 3 of kind, etc), and 5 of the same color. 

Awards for best building are also given out each round for the person(s) (it is player # dependent) who scores the most points with the dice they have used (which is dependent on the dice color and their placement within your building - with the exceptions being to glass and recycled materials - it does not matter where they are placed). You will also get 6 points if you follow your blueprint.

Here is the awesome bit - at the end of the round - everyone goes back to zero, rinse, and repeat. At the end of the game the prizes and awards you recieved along the way will be tallied to determine the winner. So it is possible to have a garbage round and still be in the hunt.

I am not going to get into the dice drafting mechanics, which is great or the bag, which is terrible...

To me this is an excellent game to break out when the wife wants low weight/low stress but "interesting decisions" (the quotes are from my wife during the game) or if you want to introduce non-gamers (whatever that means) to your wild 'n wacky world. Whether or not you chose this game or [thing=70323][/thing] to do this depends on the crowd and what style or theme of game they might be interested in. This is Yahtzee with more depth and more ability to modify your plans and adapt to the dice rolls.

We enjoy dice games, and this one (which I won from Doug Garrett) seemed like another one we needed to try.  Interestingly enough, the focus of the game really is less on rolling dice, and more on deciding what you do and don't want to take each round.

Players are following a blueprint to build a structure of 6 dice...or not.  Because each of 4 colors of dice scores differently, so you need to decide where to put them to maximize your points, and possibly compete for some special bonus cards.

It's really simple and light, but offers some interesting choices.  Follow the blueprint for a set bonus?  Stock up on recycled materials?  Put stone at the top of a skyscraper?  I think with more than 2 players the level of competition will get quite interesting.

I like this little dice based game. I think it is a fun, and maybe even novel, way to use dice. In fact, my only complaints are thematic or layout related. The "blueprint" of the building seems like it should be really important, but it isn't. Mostly it can just be ignored in pursuit of bigger goals. The "scoring" chart looks like the major part of the game, but it is just a way to keep track of who wins one of the fairly equal "real" goals. Great little game, but marred by a couple of incongruous aspects.

RATING: 7.8
Nice little filler game.  The rules are quick and easy to grasp, and explain to others.   You need both luck and strategy to win, so may not appeal to the more strategic gamer, but there are enough options to feel like you're making choices and having to narrow or reevaluate your choices as the round progresses.

In Blueprints wordt van u verwacht dat u met zeszijdige dobbelstenen - 32 in totaal - een gebouw in elkaar knutselt. Het knutselen doet u aan de hand van een bouwplankaart, een blueprint, die u in in het begin van elke ronde - er zijn er drie - willekeurig toegewezen krijgt. Het bouwplan geeft aan waar en hoe hoog u uw zes dobbelstenen moet plaatsen. Als u binnen de opgelegde bouwvoorschriften blijft en uw gebouw een exacte kopie is van het bouwplan krijgt u sowieso al zes bonuspunten. Het leuke is dat u zich geen ene moer van die voorschriften moet aantrekken als u dat niet wilt. Het enige waar u uiteindelijk rekening mee moet houden zijn de niet bebouwbare percelen op uw bouwplan. Verder doet u gewoon uw zin. Dat is erg handig want letterlijk buiten de lijntjes kleuren kan u soms meer punten opleveren dan slaafse volgzaamheid. Het leuke is dat u uw bouwonderdelen tijdens uw beurt selecteert uit een rij dobbelstenen waarvan het aantal wordt bepaald op basis van het aantal spelers. Tijdens uw beurt kiest u een dobbelsteen uit de rij bouwmaterialen, die van laag naar hoog werden gesorteerd. Vervolgens bouwt u hem in uw onroerend goed in. Aangezien een gebouw uit maximaal zes dobbelstenen bestaat doet u dat zes keer. U sluit uw beurt af door een nieuwe dobbelsteen uit de buidel te trekken, ermee te dobbelen en hem vervolgens mooi in te sorteren in het rijtje bouwmaterialen. De volgende speler zal wel weten wat hij ermee aan moet. Bouwen doet u achter uw eigenste schermpje. Oranje dobbelstenen leveren punten op per aangrenzende dobbelsteen (ongeacht de kleur), zwarte dobbelstenen scoren meer naarmate ze hoger in uw constructie zitten - om in de hoogte te bouwen moet de dobbelsteen die gebouwd wordt minstens hetzelfde aantal ogen tonen als de onderliggende -, groene dobbelstenen scoren gewoon per groene dobbelsteen in de constructie en elke doorzichtige dobbelsteen scoort het aantal ogen dat bovenaan ligt (ook als ze zijn afgedekt). In geval van gelijke stand wordt gekeken naar de twee meest gewilde bouwmaterialen, die aan het begin van een ronde op het scorebord worden gelegd. U kunt ook nog extra punten scoren voor een gebouw van minstens vijf verdiepingen, voor een gebouw met dobbelstenen van 1 tot 6, voor vijf dobbelstenen van dezelfde kleur in uw gebouw en voor constructies met minstens vier dobbelstenen van dezelfde waarde.

Fun filler game of semi abstract construction using differently coloured sharp edged dice randomly pulled from the blue bag. Each of the 4 die colors scores differently. Players can follow their blueprints for fixed bonus of 6 points, or they can deviate from that plan in order to get some of the 4 special rewards or even more points. All players are using exactly 6 dice and the luck factor, albeit helpful, is not crucial.
Have I told you about nice looking dice in a bag?

A nice little drafting game. There isn't a ton to explore in this one, but the decision of continuing to build out your blueprint or to go off-script is fairly interesting. Each dice type has its niche, and orchestrating them properly provides an occasional challenge. For the most part though, there is not much that makes me yearn for more plays.

RATING: 7
What a unique game.  It's a quicker (~30 minutes) set collection game where the dice double as the resources (stone, glass, wood, recycled) used to fulfill/build your blueprints.  

After randomly pulling the dice out of the bag and, of course, chucking them with much vigor, you then puzzle together your blueprint and as many bonuses as possible based on the various color and number combinations that result.  When all is said and done the game is largely a tactical affair, but it really does seem to work.  

I have only played a few two player games but everyone who's played has enjoyed it.  That said, the two player variant has a "remove a dice" mechanism at the end of each player's turn that likely changes the flow and feel of the game somewhat.  

I'll update after we give it a try w/ 3+ player counts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An "ok" and light dice constructing game.  But I was disappointed with it because the choices aren't that interesting.  Part of the problem is that, the reward cards in the center are never really worth enough to prompt players to want to deviate from their original blueprint.  Instead, you kind of get lucky if your blueprint happens to match one of the criteria of the cards in the center of the board.  I mean, unless your blueprint has a building that is 5 high (which I don't think any do) it's not going to be worth sacrificing the 6 points you get for completing your objective in order to get a 2 point reward. Because of this, choices were often simple.  Because your build is behind a barrier, it's difficult to stymy other players and as a result feels solitary.

Mechanically very streamlined and simple to learn to play, but there is depth of strategy there as occasionally it is worth disregarding the blueprint in front of you and building towards the bonus victory points conditions such as 4 of a numbers or 5 dice high. 
Nice large pile of blueprints to play through as well which is nice.

One 4-player game at the Z-man game of the Essen Spiel'13. I really wanted to like this game, the cover had already sold it to me ! The concept is great, the components are ok, but the game is dull. The game is devoid of any interesting decision, dictated buy events (or absence of therefof) that you have absolutely no control upon. It is therefore a plain bad game for grown ups. It could be a fun game for kids though, were it not for the overly complex scoring rules that make it hard to play for young ones. If they can grasp the score, they will be bored playing this...

A big letdown of Essen in my eyes.

Seit YSPAHAN erprobt sich der Würfel in der Moderne des Brettspiels außerhalb seiner ursprünglichen Funktion. Auch BLUEPRINTS enthält eine Würfelidee, die ihn mehr Richtung Kniffel rollen lässt - hier als dreidimensionale, haptische Variante. BLUEPRINTS macht aus dem Spieler einen Bauherrn, der sich hinter dem klassischen Sichtschirm seines Architektenbüros auf der Basis von Blaupausen und einem imaginierten Bauhelm aus Würfeln Gebäude baut. Dabei verkörpert jeder der farbigen Qualitätswürfel einen Baustoff. Während des Baus der siebenwürfeligen urbanen Bauhäuser Marke Bürostadt zockt man auf diverse Auftragsvorgaben, in denen die verbauten Würfel Punkte bringen. Oder man schaut in die Abwasserkanalröhre. Das grundsteinlegende Spielgerüst ist zwar nicht ganz neu, interpretiert sich aber schön kurzweilig, vor allem gemessen an der Spielzeit. Und gut aussehen tut es auch: Der reduzierte, reissbrettartige Bauzeichner-Stil verleiht dem kleinen Ding überraschenderweise sogar Flair. Als die überteuerte Immobilienblase platzte, gab es BLUEPRINTS zum Discounter-Preis. Der Bauch des Architekten von Peter Greenaway sagt ja zu diesem beiläufigen Kleinod.

The concepy of dice roll + each color being a different type is very cool. Plays fast and has some nice choices for a dice game

You do have to remember that the award cards are the real points in this game and how you win.

You can't really adjust your strategy once you start and the dice can be RNG for that last one you need since each building fits exactly the number of dice you get and there is little wiggle room to go for multiple things. But it's a light game that plays fast so it is ok

A great dice game where dice are something more that just randomizers. It offers a great amount of decisions and is quick compared to the playing time.

There is a lot of game put in a relatively small box. I enjoyed it and will gladly play again although with every play there was this feeling growing inside me. Feeling of being too restricted by the rules.

On the other hand these limitations make it such a simple and yet deep game so you should definitely try it out by yourself.

Innovative way to use dice. I was afraid it would be a bit too point salad with the multiple ways to score points, but you really have to focus on 1-2 of the 6 available each round. Obviously there is a luck factor but for a 30 minute quick filler I thought it was fun with some significant decisions to be made. Other people I played with also enjoyed it.

This game is really fun.  I love the concept, the components, and the dice drafting.  The only thing that would make this better would be more scoring cards that would make each round different.  Having the same four goals out makes each round and each play start to feel a little bit samey.

Similar feel to azul but a little easier. Great game, it's really fun to do the unveiling, especially for people who haven't played before. Suffers the Splendor curse to a lesser degree though. (Splendor curse - staring at a similar spot the whole time you play without talking). 

edit: Down to a 6 since I haven't wanted to play this once sine I first got it. 

edit: Very sad to say it but I think I'd rather play Azul every time. I imagine I'll hang onto this so I can keep the dice to play liars dice.

Ingenious filler which engages on different levels: a visual-spacial level, a strategic level and hazard-probability level.

Rating could go up after more plays.

A nice little filler where you use the dice to construct buildings behind a screen. Each building is scored based on various attributes and earns VPs based on those scores or other bonuses. After three rounds, most VPs wins.

I like that following the blueprint is optional because it opens up alternate scoring opportunities. It may not always be your best option, but it's there if something better presents itself.

„Építészkockák”
Ezt a játékot más BGG-n aktív gémerek jó kritikája, ajánlására szereztem be külföldről és próbáltam ki.
A gyors szabályismertetés és szintén gyors előkészítés után egy-egy építész bőrébe bújva a rendelkezésre álló építőanyagok (ezt szimbolizálják a különböző színű 6 oldalú dobókockák) közül egyet választva vagy a forduló elején véletlenszerűen kapott tervrajzodat építed meg vagy az egyik díjra hajtasz (szerencsésebb esetben mindkettőre, vagy akár több díjra is).
Egy fordulóban mindenkinek 6 lehetősége van építőanyagot szerezni és azt beépíteni épületébe, majd mindenki felfedi a paravánja mögött található (igen, mindenki rejtve építkezik a fordulóban, bár azt mindenki látja milyen típusú építőanyagot választasz) épületét és lepontozzák azt kiosztva az elismeréseket és a korábban említett díjakat is.
Három forduló végeztével pedig győztest hirdetnek ebben a gyors játékban.
A játék külalakban, minőségben egyben van, mellette gyorsan megtanulható, előkészíthető. A szabály kivételével nem szükséges angol nyelvtudás, a szabály pedig rajongói fordításban elérhető bárki számára.
Mindezek ellenére számomra csalódást keltett több játék után, hogy a 4 elérhető díj bár azonos pontszámot ér, mégis valamelyiket könnyebb, valamelyiket nehezebb elérni és ilyen szempontból a játékegyensúllyal probléma van.
Több felhasználó is jelezte ezt a játék BGG oldalán annak fórumán és a játék kitalálója egy variánsban ajánlást is tett másfajta pontozásra (arany 6 pont, ezüst 4 pont, bronz 2 pont, felhőkarcoló 3 pont, egységes szerkezet 4 pont, nyersanyag díj 5 pont, geometriai díj 6 pont). Ezt a variánst mindenképpen ajánlom kipróbálni, mint magát a játékot is.

It works, it's fast and the idea is fine, but the gameplay itself, specially the scoring part couldn't convince me. It feels like it doesn't matter what you do, aslong as you arn't doing it random. We had to use tie-breakers all the time, even though we went different routes.

May sound tightly balanced, but to me it's plain boring, as it doesn't matter in the end. The dice should be worth "points" in a more diverse way, like being on the 2nd level or touching different colored dice. There should be less open cards and those should be shuffled to create a race for them. As it is, players won't compete in that regard, which makes it boring again.

Very enjoyable game, much better than Cubist.
If you like clever, streamlined games for casual gaming this is something for you.
Since players build behind a screen, you're never quite sure what they're going for. Looking for wich dice they go can help to some degree.
You could go for several VP cards and/or for most points during a turn, meaning you have lots of options. That way luck doesn't play such a huge role. Also everyone builds with dice from the same dice pool.
Good, well balanced game.

Doesn't overstay it's welcome. Good components.

I would have loved (and payed for) dice that would've had their respective texture (wood, stone, etc.) in the way the glass dice are translucent.

Building up dices in a fast pace game abstract thing. You have a plan, but you don't have to follow it if you can get better points. I don't like the paravan thing, i love to see what my opponents do. You can remember what dices shou took of course, but you don't know what she is trying to achieve. It was a nice opportunity to try it out, but im not fond of with it.

Pros / Cons:
-A game which plays fast.

-Too much luck for me.
-A better theme would be nice if you ask me.

An object lesson in producing an attractive filler game about creating 'buildings' out of dice, trying to get the best scoring one at the table. The problem is, the scoring is completely off. You may as well ignore your 'blueprint' and just build a tower, the scoring is all about getting black dice as high as possible, the 6 point bonus for completing your plan just isn't enough. A real shame.

Initial Rating: 5.0 ( July 2016)

Blueprints is a light dice game. Its main appeal is that it plays very fast. Playtime is around 30 minutes.

The rules are very easy to teach. You can do it under 6 minutes. The game components are very well done. The art does its job, but it isn’t earth shattering.

Players are architects trying to build structures for VPs. The theme is irrelevant to me, but in any case you don’t feel it through the game. 

I like that you have the option to deviate from your blueprint to get bonuses, it seems to me that´s the best option most of the time though.

Lots of uncontrollable luck on this one (the random cards, the rolling of the dice, the random color of the dice you draw from the bag).

The scoring system is a bit weird and counterintuitive, but it doesn’t bother me much.

For me, Blueprints has very easy, uninteresting and obvious decisions. The best available die is always obvious and many times you succeed due to luck of the draw. The tiebreaker seems unfair to me as it is decided by luck and when it goes all the way, the first player has a disadvantage. It is very hard to stop a person unless you are doing something similar that uses the same dice, that is, I don’t want to take the orange dice if what I need are the black dice so “attacking” a player often harms more the attacker than the defender.

Bottom line, Blueprints is way too light and boring for my current tastes, it still managed to surprise me and it is a bit better than I initially though it would be. It has lots of uncontrollable luck. It can be an excellent family game but it isn’t a game for me. I won’t buy it and my desire to play it again is low.

Nice little family weight filler.  I like the tactics vs. strategy elements with the beginning dice pool and addition of a new one from the bag each turn.

Easy enough for almost anyone to pick up on but deep enough to satisfy gamers, this works well with lots of groups.

Overall, it is a great purchase for the little price you pay, good for quick play sessions when you feel that Agricola or Terra Mystica are going to be too heavy.

Blueprints is a pretty fun little game.  I like how the objective isn't necessarily to build your building, it's all about scoring the most points.  Occasionally, building your blueprints exactly and grabbing the bonus points will knock you into first however, building the tallest structure can bump you.  In the same, it can really hurt you to do either, depending on the "market".  It's a cool idea and functions well throughout play.

Overestimated filler game. Far more potential for frustration than enjoyment. Bustle around behind your player screen, combine luck of drawing the right color of dice, rolling the right number and getting lucky that no other player pursues the same goal.

I love the drafting of dice, the different things you can go for, and the rapid pace at which the game is played. I like that building good buildings is not necessarily the goal, but to reach "artistic" objectives is what scores more points.

A light, breezy game with little confrontation. I always appreciate dice games that use dice in unique ways, and I liked that you can deviate from your blueprint if you think it will net you more points. That said, I kind of wish there was some more "there" there. Another player suggested, and I think I agree, that it might be more interesting without the player screens. Or with the "buildings" exposed but the blueprints themselves hidden.

Nice concept for a game, using dice to build buildings and dice colour representing different material. Plays quickly, but the game suffers a bit of variability as everything scores the same. I'm not a fan of the prize cards either as you can flat out ignore your blueprint and score big.

A nifty mixture of puzzle and a kind of racing game. Going for the extra win conditions will usually pull you in a different direction from getting as many building points as possible, so there is a lot of subtle interaction in guessing your opponents‘ intentions from the dice they pick.

What keeps this from being great is that luck can have a very hefty influence – in a game where typical scores are around ten points, getting or not getting that last crucial die for an extra win condition (worth two points) can be crucial. Since it’s a tad too long for a filler, this puts it in a somewhat uncomfortable niche.

Short and clever game with some very interesting decision making, and an innovative use of dice (both in the drafting and placement). Whenever I'm looking for a 20-minute game that still requires a fair amount of thinking and tough tactical choices to make, this fits the bill perfectly. 

My only slight criticism is that you roll a new die into the pool to replace the one you just drafted. I understand why they do this and it's not a huge issue, but it can add a fair amount of swingyness to a game that is otherwise mostly devoid of luck-based elements.

Decent filler that plays fast and doesn't overstay its welcome. Offers decisions of the right frequency and complexity for a game of its length. I like that the blueprint can be ignored, which at times is a wise decision to score higher on the main award and at other times allows you to score two different bonuses while completely ignoring the main scoring. I like the concept of "play a die, trash a die" that is used in the two-player game and wish it were used in the three and four-player versions.

Very enjoyable building game.  I really want to get in more 3-4 players games since I've mostly done two, but I'm still really liking it.  Having several dice to choose from reduces the dice-based luck while still adding a lot of variability and uncertainty.  The multiple scoring cards are very cool since they encourage you to compromise in one area to hopefully earn points in multiple areas, giving it a nice push-your-luck feel.  I would love to see promos or expansions with additional scoring possibilities.  Excellent art and component quality, other than the too-small bag that was included (I replaced mine with a larger one), and very easy to teach.

Bought at GenCon 2014

A decent lightweight game. I think the idea is great (creating buildings from blueprints by allocating and stacking dice), but there are a few issues with choices and scoring. For example, a clear (glass) dice is always undesired if it has a low number, which creates options that everyone avoids until someone by bad luck has to take it.

Good fun, but not overly strategic.

I don't like most of dice games, but during last Essen something has changed. Blueprints is a nice looking game, architectonic theme pleases me, dice are aesthetic (better than in eg.

Többet vártam, de így sem rossz.

Megadott tervrajz alapján kell négyféle színű kockákból építkezni három körön át és természetesen minden kör végén lepontozni az építményt (a játékosok a többiek épületét nem látják a pontozásig, hála a paravánoknak).

Fillernek talán túl mély (folyamatosan számolgatni kell, hogy melyik kocka beépítésével tudunk több pontot csinálni), komolyabb játéknak meg kevés. Kicsit olyan, mintha két szék között ültek volna a földre a játék tervezői.

Az ötlet maga egyébként nagyon jó, újrajátszhatósága is kiváló és ugye kockákkal építkezni tipikusan az a téma, ami a játékosok nagy részének izgalmas kihívás.

An impulsive purchase but one I'm quite tickled with so far: it's breezy fast and fun and I love the graphic look of the cards, player screens, and rules. The scoring is varied and just complicated enough to keep things challenging and interesting. I'm a little concerned about the special prize cards, which vary noticeably in degree of difficulty yet are equal in terms of victory points. Also, as others have noted, the handsomely made dice draw bag is too small for its purpose. [5 plays]

What a fun little game. Such a great idea and very simple to learn but with some real depth of gameplay and meaningful decision to make every turn. As it’s a dice game there is some luck, but it’s much more about managing your luck, and mitigating for poor luck than blindly trusting to Dame Fortuna.

The game plays over three rounds and each round every player is given a secret blueprint to complete by arranging the dice they pick up in a certain fashion. Completing the blueprint (which a player is not obliged to do -they can build a skyscraper if the wish) scores points but so do other things like placing different coloured dice in different patterns and proximity to each other, at different heights or just having a lot of the one colour - each colour die will score differently so there can be competition for ever diminishing resources as the game progresses. 

Once scores are totalled points are awarded for first second and third most points as well as achieving other objectives that are not points-related. More than one scoring card can be awarded in each turn so players have to decide where to concentrate their efforts. As each edifice is constructed in secret and is only revealed at the end of a round you also don’t know what your rivals are working on so decision making is not straightforward at all.

All-in-all [thing=140933][/thing] is a terrific little game with great depth and replayability. This is one I’ll not refuse to play again and will consider for purchase should I see it at the ‘right price’.

Le système de pointage me déplaît fortement. De plus, il y a trop peu de marge de manoeuvre pour réaliser le plan reçu et pour satisfaire aux exigences des cartes bonus. 

Un jeu qui est donc à la fois court mais très calculatoire et qui demande beaucoup d'observation.

L'obtention des points est peut-être un peu trop ardue compte tenu de la place que prend le hasard des dés tirés

On y gagne peut-être à y rejouer souvent. Mais pour ma part, j'ai eu deux mauvaises premières rondes lors de mes deux parties, et j'ai été incapable de revenir de l'arrière. Pas très excitant.

Blueprints is a mildly interesting task that one can perform with dice. The drafting mechanic and spatial placement mechanics are neat, but the game is just dice. Dice are visually boring. Look! The game told me to make this shape with my dice, and I did it! I used these dice. Wanna count them with me? Blah. (Not blech!) The game is not bad, just boring.

Really like the building with dice concept, the scoring somehow is a bit odd to me in that the total scores for the buildings don't really matter at the end and the bonus points for certain things that have nothing to do with the building you get seem off compared to the points for the building.

RATING: 7
I quite liked this and could happily see myself playing more in future. All the pulling out of dice and rolling is painful, but once you roll all the dice into a box lid at the start of the round (blind) and pull them out blind, as they are, that sped the game up considerably and made it much more enjoyable, allowing the players to get straight to the meat of the game ... choosing which die to take! Basically, it's a draft of 9 dice, pick one, replace. The 4 dice colours all score in different ways, so you're trying to balance the colour you want with the pip-count you want in order to arrange your 6 dice as per your secret design for bonus points, whilst also trying to get dice that met the open goals all are competing for (1-6, all one colour, etc). Of course the dice are never exactly how you'd like them so there's a constant weighing up of which way to go. A ton of luck obviously, but we got the game down to about 20 minutes which was perfect, and the constant decisions, though light, were enjoyable. A nice addition to the filler niche.

A very simple game where you chose a dice from the seven on the table and try to build what is on your blueprint. Each color of dice gets bonuses a different way so you need to figure out the most optimal build, but of course there is a lot of luck as the dice you would ideally need will surely not be available. Cute but not much more.

RATING: 3
Somehow this game takes a mechanic that is usually fun, dice drafting, and turns it into a total snooze. I think the biggest culprit is the lame scoring system.  You put a lot of effort into choosing which colors (materials) to pick and where to place them to score the most points.  And what is your reward for scoring the most points in a round? A card worth 2 or 3 points.  All those points you just scored just disappear after the round is over. It's simply not worth the effort.  Yes, there are some other awards you can score, such as tallest building, but they aren't terribly exciting either.   But the scoring of the colors which takes the most time and effort results in such a lame reward that the game is just not worth playing.

The best dice game I've played. Somehow the dice aren't really that random, yet it's not a case of "everything is good so it doesn't matter what I do" either. There's real inequality in how each player will view a particular dice and the scoring system really makes the game.

Not spectacular but seems to go down well enough with everyone who plays.

Everything I’ve heard about Blueprints has been lukewarm at best, so I wasn’t thrilled when someone pulled it out as a filler while we waited for the rest of the group. It turned out a bit better than I thought, probably because I tend to like games that have players drafting from a common pool. In the end, I won, but I’m not sure how. There is substantial luck in the game, and if some players compete for certain colors or numbers, it leaves the final player free to have his way with another type of dice. Though not terrible, this is a pass for me.

In this game you play three rounds. Each round you get a card that shows six dice arranged in some way. Then, six times around the table you take a die and add it to your board. Then you score. Each die color scores in a different way, so there is some creativity and push your luck to this game. I did very poorly in it, as each round I found myself one piece away from getting any special bonus points. It's a cute filler that I'd play again, but the randomness means I'm not super enthusiastic.

For 30 minutes, you can do a lot worse, I guess. It's a somewhat dry & mathy dice game that's not Yahtzee. You're dealt a card with a design on it that requires 6 dice to be considered "completed" and then you all draft dice of different building materials to build (or not; see below) the structure. It's slightly wonky to explain since you score once (for the round) and then based on that temporary total you gain a different number of points that persist for the remainder of the game, but once you play a round any lingering confusion tends to disappear. I like the spatial aspect, as building a chunky building made of dice is satisfying (although the game's integrity is sort of compromised if someone inadvertently knocks their building over with a billowy sleeve since the die faces/orientation/ordering matter a great deal here). You also don't have to pursue the blueprint of the card you're dealt if you don't want to, as sometimes failing to achieve your design is worth more points than building it. 

I have to say that I might prefer the 2p variant of this one, as you can trash one die when claiming one for yourself. This introduces a really great player-driven way to create some frustration, otherwise it gets a little obvious what people are going to claim, especially in the final few rolls.

I was kind of surprised by how much this game brought. The actual shape of the buildings you're making each round is more-or-less irrelevant, since either you're completing the shape completely or disregarding it and building the 6-story monstrosity for the Award. It's satisfying to physically "construct" the building, even if it is only with dice.

Solid, easy to learn, fun game. Could use a little more depth though. There isn't enough of an incentive to stick to your blueprint. You can win a good percentage of the time by always stacking dice straight up (with black ones on top). But overall, pretty decent. I'm keeping it around.

Description: A Light, quick, dice rolling, dice drafting, structure building game based on the secret blueprint pattern.
Players: 2 to 4. Best with 4.

Impression: Really neat construction game using dice from the open draft. There are 4 types of dice, one color for each material: orange for wood, black for stone, green for recyclable and clear for glass. After the die is taken, the new one i rolled. When everybody has placed the 6th die on a building behind their screen, structures are revealed and scored accordingly. Each material has different rules for scoring. If blueprint is completed it is scored as well, but players can deviate from the plan and build their own creations to collect various prizes. Total number of points in three rounds wins the game.

Blueprints presents a nice twist on dice placement in that you have to build a rudimentary architectural structure with your dice. You are awarded bonus points for completing your structure, for including unique predetermined features (i.e. 5 dice tall, all dice are different pips, etc) and for arranging certain dice colors in a specific way.

The interesting bit is that the points you accumulate from your structure do not actually indicate your victory point total, but rather, your score on an award track. The person at the end of a round who is farthest up the award track gets a bronze, silver, or gold medal, and the medals are actually what net you a win. 

This is a filler in all respects, but it is just not to my taste. It seems too easy to come out on top by simply ignoring the actual blueprint designs, which just seems fundamentally wrong when considering the theme of the game. 

(+) Pretty components, no doubt about that.
(+) Short game length lends to playability.
(+) Unique take on a restraint of the conventional VP system.

(-) Gets -very- boring. The decisions presented are too straightforward.
(-) Facetious in a sense. Ignore your blueprint plans and focus on other scoring bonuses and you will score higher.
(-) Shallow gameplay. Lacks variety to warrant further replays.

A game with a smaller number of hugely important and interesting decisions.  It must be one of the first, if not the first game that was brave enough to allow players to store dice behind a shield.  This has of course paved the way for other games, like Roll For the Galaxy.  

The strategy is slightly too complex for my 7 year old, but my 8 year old totally understood it and actually won our first game.  

Really great family game that feels quite unique.

Pleasing.  I was worried that the puzzly aspect would be too mathy and that the drafting part would be too random, but neither fear materialized.  I found the game to get a little repetitive by the end, so I'm glad it only lasts 3 rounds, but I still enjoyed it.

update: the more I play, the less I like it.  It's too mathy for kids and too random for adults (especially those alternate goals!), so it has a very narrow window of opportunity at best.  It's interesting a few times, but lacks replay value.

RATING: 7
Pretty fun light filler, but the game kind of plays you - you get to make a couple choices on your first dice selections, but then your options become more and more limited - you just take the die that give you the most points and that you're allowed to place.  Some commenters clearly misunderstood that game and didn't realize that scoring a 2-point card on the table is as valuable as placing 2nd on the round score track, which will usually require 30+ dice points.  Completing your blueprint for 6 dice points is nothing compared to claiming a 2-point score card.  So I think there's some depth I still need to explore in deciding when to deviate from your blueprint when you don't think you're going to place 1st or 2nd on the track to claim a 2-point card.  The problems is some blueprints are much more conducive to allowing you to deviate - the 1x2x3high setup is very limiting.

Építőipar, színes kockák, mi kell még?! Persze, a tematikához remekül illeszkedő játékmenet. Igen kiváló komponensek (imádom ezeket a sarkos, nagy kockákat, főleg a víztiszta nagyon jó!), a dobozig (amely egyáltalán nincs túlméretezve!) bezárólag első rangú minden! Remek a hangulata a rajzoknak is, nagyon egyben van a játék.
Lehet, hogy egyeseknek fillernek már túl gondolkodós, komolyabb játéknak meg túl nagy szerencsével bír. Nekünk mindenesetre nagyon bejött. Talán lehetne valahogy kicsit hosszabb, mélyebb is egy-egy kör, de alapjában véve az egész így nagyon pure feelinggel bír.

Egyre jobban tetszik! Minden mindennel összefügg, dinamikusan lehet taktikát váltani, kétszemélyes játéknak kifejezetten jó.

Played this game twice. Tried the 2 player variant and the a regular 3 player game. It is a fun game overall. I played with my 6 and 9 year old and they can understand the rule just fine. A huge part of the game is to go after the prize. My kids tend to ignore those and focus on their own building, which is fine. I guess you can have a house rule to not play with the prize and just go for the points each round if you play with young children. My kids like the game and I think it is fun. Easy to learn. Great filler game.

One thing I find is pretty interesting. You can go with any strategy for your building, follow the drawing or not, and the result can come out pretty close. It's a very clever design.

Very cool little game where you're constructing a 3D building out of dice. Each colored die has its own way of scoring points, and there are plenty of decisions to be made in this one. It's not just another dice game. It's very good.

Interesting dice-building game. I really like the simplistic drawings on the cards and there are a number of interesting decisions for such a short game. 

I dislike the implication that blueprints are optional and builders can build whatever they want when the plans are inconvenient. Seriously, I do wish the dice bag was larger since randomizing is difficult.

For the longest time I played this wrong (no idea how that happened) and was just lukewarm about it. (We missed the rule that you can only build on dice with lower or equal values).

RATING: 7
Blueprints is a light, abstract filler which uses dice as building blocks. Players draft dice from a pool one at a time and arrange them on a blueprint provided. While there are two compulsory rules to bear in mind while placing the dice, the rest of the placement depends on the awards that players are aiming for, such as having 4 dice of the same value or building a tower of 5 dice or more. 

As far as dice-based fillers go, Blueprints offers something original in a market where dice fillers are equated to Yahtzee variants. I enjoy the spatial considerations when scoring dice as well as the mix of compulsory and self-imposed constraints which provide a bit of a strategic arc to the gameplay. It's easy to dismiss the game as fluffy as luck plays a large role in determining what is in the pool by the time your turn rolls around, but there are some times when you can really rack your brain over which die to pick.

Blueprints surprised me.  It's a quick dice drafting and building game.  There are 4 types of dice and each scores differently.  Each person has a hidden blueprint to build and all buildings take 6 dice, but all blueprints are different.  So it's a quick exercise it drafting the dice that work for your building and can optimize points.  There are bonuses for doing other stuff.  It may sound like a lot of calculation that needs to happen, but it's all really quite quick and painless.  There are surprisingly several strategies in a small, easy game.

This is an enjoyable dice drafting and building game.  It's simple to teach, learn, and play.  It plays very quickly and doesn't overstay it's welcome since it's only three rounds in length.  Scoring can be a bit tricky, but it gets easier with more plays.  Overall, game play is good.  However, the component quality is not.  The included dice bag is barely large enough to hold all of the dice.  That means that is is far TOO SMALL to actually effectively mix up the dice.  The opening is also too small to reach in and actually get a die out of the bag.  That is a big problem; a larger bag is definitely necessary.  In addition, the dice themselves, while functional, are not great.  The pips are missing some white paint on many of the dice.  Also, while the clear dice are thematic since they represent glass, it's easy to see through the dice and therefore the pips on other sides are visible and can cause a little confusion when trying to determine the actual value.  Frosted or white dice would have been a better option for game play purposes.  Card sleeves aren't necessary, but the box is still large enough to hold everything even if the cards are sleeved.  This game does have a good price point though.

RATING: 5
A very light, very quick game. We finish in under 20 minutes for all three rounds. It is kind of annoying that the awards and prizes are all worth the same amount in the 2-player game. We tried using Tourigny's suggested values for the prizes, but I don't think they're properly balanced. Michelle doesn't care for it, partly because she feels like a game should work out of the box. Trying to figure out balanced values for the prizes takes work, which she feels the designer should have done in the first place.

A quick little tableau building game that is driven by dice drafting from a communal pool. The level of randomness is a little high for my liking, even for a drafting game. Have to try some variants that mitigate the randomness - for e.g., open building or rolling all the dice at the same time!

Very enjoyable light game. You have some interesting strategies but it still comes down to what is available to you on your turn. I like the push your luck aspect to trying to get certain achievements (Going for 1-6 on dice faces but then missing that one die you need on the last turn). The cards are excellent quality and the artwork is perfect for the theme (even though the theme is very light for what is essentially an abstract game).

Blueprints proves that a design can be clever without being interesting. Dice drafting is a clever idea; I can't recall seeing it before. But the game can be reduced to the math underlying it far too easily, which means that the choices it offers are obvious. The dice will decide the result among even halfway competent players. Yahtzee is better.

This is a quick little building game where you take turns selecting colored dice to build a blueprint plan.  What color dice you select and how you use them have different scoring implications.  Top score for the round gets victory points.  There are three rounds.  There are a couple of other ways to also get victory points.  I play this one with family and I played it with my brothers- they seemed to enjoy it.

RATING: 8
What an excellent light filler!  I was blown away by how much I like this game, especially since I don't typically like lighter games.  Part of it may be that I just love rolling dice and interesting dice mechanics (one of the reasons I adore Feld) but this really is a clever little game besides.

Each player has a hidden blueprint made up of 6 stacked dice that they hide behind a screen.  Every turn players draft a die from a pool and roll a replacement for the next player until each has 6 dice.  The only rule is higher value dice need to be stacked on top of lower valued dice.

Where the greatness of this game comes in is the scoring system.  There are 4 different colors of dice each representing a different building material and they each score in a different way.  Sometimes you can score more points not even following your blueprint (worth 6 points) but rather building your own construction and getting more points from these dice.  Whoever has the first and second most points in a round scores 4 or 2 points and 3 rounds are played.  There are also "achievements" players can score for 2 points each round and it may be possible to score 2 or even 3 of them (all 4 is impossible because one is 4-of-a-kind and the other is a large straight).

The one negative with this game is how few points there are to go around and how this makes for too claustrophobic of final scores.  I guess I don't really feel like I won as much when I only won by 2 points.  But I enjoy the game play and it is super simple to teach and play with anyone and finishes in 20 minutes.  Excellent game for that category.

Fun, quick dice game with only a little bit of luck, but mostly strategy. No need for AP as each player just has one decision--which is the best die to pick? Even if you're completely hopeless at making a decision, you can choose and use almost any die to get points. 

Unusual scoring system in that the 20-30 points you rack up during the round are only to determine at the end of that round who gets (in a 4 player game) the gold, silver, or bronze card. It's those points (3,2, or 1) which(in addition to other prize points cards that are 2 points each) are added up to determine the winner.

Enjoyable dice-drafting objective-hitting game. Great box size & components (apart from the comically-undersized bag).

Two snags. First, when being taught I was warned that multiple players could aim for the same objective on a turn and someone could end up disappointed to be empty-handed. Secondly (& more important for me) the [i]stacking[/i] element would be a problem with a couple of people I'd regularly play with.

I tend to be bad at dice games. I tend to enjoy dice games. I tend to be good at stacking games or games with a 3D element. I tend to enjoy those kinds of games. Blueprints brings those elements together with simple rules and nice components.
The interaction in this game comes mainly from avoiding what the other players are focusing on. If someone else is going for green, there's little point in going for it yourself. You will hurt the other player's changes, but your own as well, and someone else will probably take the lead. So the thing is to optimize your own chances rather than hurting someone else's.
The rules for this game are not very good though. They hardly tell you the way the bonus cards work or the exact way you calculate the score. A lot has to be deduced, as it is not explained at all. The effect of the different cards isn't explained either. That could have been executed much better.
But the game itself is enjoyable and fast, with little downtime. It isn't great though, just a solid, but very average game.

This just comes off as an optimization exercise for me. There's some strategy in paying attention to what others are doing and planning accordingly. But this isn't something I'd do for fun.

It would probably work as a family game.

RATING: 6.5
The ideia for [thing=140933][/thing] is pretty easy to explain: there are three rounds, and in each round each player receives a blueprint, which shows the structure and the spaces allowed to put dice on. In order to build, players use, each turn, a die from a pool of six available dice. Each round lasts 6 turns, so every player will use 6 dice to build. After taking a die, the player take one at random from the bag, rolls it and adds it to the available dice for the next player.

The dice in the base of the building can have any number showing on top of the die. But, in order to put a die above it, this one must be of the same number or above.

There are 4 types of dice, and each has their own way of scoring at the end of the round:
- the [b]green[/b] scores accordingly the amount of them (not individually) (1 die=2pts, 2=5pts, 3=10pts, 4=15pts, 5=20pts, 6 dice=30pts);
- the [b]black[/b] scores accordingly to the height it is (on the base=2pts, 2º level=3pts, 3º=5pts, 4º=8pts, 5=8pts, 6º level=8pts);
- the [b]white[/b] scores accordingly to the number showing on top of it (even if it is covered by other die);
- the [b]orange[/b] scores accordingly to the number of dice it has adjacent to it (i.e: sharing a face; so, diagonally doesn't count), therefore the die can be worth from 0 point (sharing zero faces) to a maximum of 12 points (sharing six faces).

Besides this points, the player receives 6 points if he is able to made the structure to match the blueprint. After the six turns, at the end of the round, all the points for dice plus the points for fulfulling the blueprint are given. The player with the highest score takes the first prize, the second highest, the second prize, and so on.

Also, every round there are 4 objective cards ([b]Skyscraper[/b] for a building 5 cubes or more high, [b]Materials[/b] for 5 or more of the same material in the building, [b]Structural Integrity[/b] for 4 or more dice having the same face value, [b]Geometer[/b] for a building using all 6 different face values in the building), each is worth 2 points. One player can get more than one objective in a round, but the objectives can't be shared, so, in case of a tie for it, there is a tie breaker, considering the dice used in the structure.

Once the prizes and objectives are given, the score is reset and a new round begins. After three rounds, players tally all the points of their objectives and awards, and the player with the highest amount if the winner!

[thing=140933][/thing] showed itself as a light, easy and quick (even if I was accused of taking too long to pick a die, but the "too long" is for more seconds than others, not minutes) game. The production value is also pretty good - the dice are clear, really easy to see the numbers, and even though they aren't of Chessex quality, they do the job just fine; the art is thematic and well made; the whole package of the game is good. Even the scoring of the different dice, which can take some moments to explain and understand, is made crystal clear in the screen of the players (that doubles as a player aid).

A normal play of [thing=140933][/thing] will last around 20-25 minutes, and even if some of the decisions to be made are sometimes given, most of the time you will have to ponder which die is best, not only for scoring, but also to take objectives, since two objetives are worth more than being the one with the highest scoring building.

All in all, [thing=140933][/thing] isn't the best filler around ([thing=37759][/thing] and [thing=172][/thing] are two above this one, for example), it still do a good job in the entertainment department, since I always find to be fun to actually build something during a game. This one definitely scores high in visuals, and being easy to teach and learn, it will probably be a fine game to grab some unsuspecting players to play it. Overall, I like it.

Fun quick dice game with a cool spacial element and pretty quick 

Played with four from 10 to in their 40s and all enjoyed

Once we were done I was packing it up and the others wanted to play again - good stuff

Not one to play non-stop or all the time of course but small enough to carry around and play when waiting around or want something a bit different

One issue with the production quality - no Human being that has ever lived could fit their damn hand in the world's smallest dice bag they provided....

I am now forced to immediately down a bottle of crown royal to get an adequate bag - thanks, blueprints, for making me an alcoholic.....

Only played this game two and three player so far, and it plays very well with just two. After a couple of plays I still feel like it is a unique addition to my extensive collection. Turns are quick, decisions are meaningful, and you need to keep a close eye on the dice that your opponents takes from the common pool, trying to guess which award(s) he or she is aiming for. The game is highly portable, and the components (especially the dice themselves) are great. Good medium filler game, and one of the best dice games around.

I was originally intrigued by the unique use of die in this game. Most games with dice uses only the numerical but not spatial aspects of the die. Blueprints is one of the few games I know that uses a spatial component on top of the numerical value for assembling the dice on a predetermined blue print. Having played this game a handful of times with two players, I do not think this game scales well with 2. It is likely true that with two players, you can have better grasp of short term tactical strategy for dice selection than you can with 4 players. But at the end of the day, because the scoring opportunities are so low, the game is usually over if someone is ahead by more than 2 cards or 4 points. That makes the game somewhat more anticlimactic.

Still, the game deserves a place on my shelf until otherwise supplanted by a better dice game which incorporates spatial information into the design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A really nice, quick, dice drafting/building game. The scoring, as mentioned by others, is a bit "sharp" (the gap between getting some points and any points is remarkably tiny), but it's fast enough that it's not too much of a bother.

(Way overdue) UPDATE: Frustration with the "flat" scoring led to an attempt to re-balance that failed miserably. The frustration-factor inherent in dice-drafting games ultimately made me lose interest, despite the svelte qualities of the design.

RATING: 7.8
Simple but overrated. I feel like an expansion could take this game a long way. Still, I think the base game will get tons of plays in the future.

Yahtzee with some strategy and tactics. Works best with two, maybe most fun with four.

Designer’s advice:

[q="Yves Tourigny"]Hi James,

The short answer is that it was a design decision. While there are inherent differences in the difficulty of qualifying for a specific prize, these are frequently washed out by the luck of the dice and the double-think in the metagame.

Simplicity was favoured over a thoroughly balanced point system, because simplicity increased fun while a more complex point system did not.

The great thing about boardgames is that you can modify the point system without great effort. Sleeve your cards and put whatever values you want on them. If I were to modify the Prize and Award cards to reflect what (I think are) the "real" difficulty levels, I think I would go with:

Gold 6VP
Silver 4VP
Bronze 2VP

Structural Integrity (4+ same value) 4VP
Materials Prize (5+ same colour) 5VP
Skyscraper Prize (height 5+) 3VP
Geometer's Prize (values 1-6) 6VP

You may disagree with those and try something different, or leave things as they are. If you do try it out, let me know what you think.[/q]

I've been playing this one for a while now and I've only just realised it's a super light presentation game, something of a rarity in a genre that is full of much heavier hitters, the lightest of which is probably Ristorante Italia.
This is a great game of building little structures out of 6 total dice, one at a time in turn, and then evaluating them depending on materials used (colours of dice), adjacency and specific criteria. A very clever game that hits above its weight.

Players build towers using dice, different color dice score points differently.  Dice can only be placed on top of lower-numbered dice.  Your score each round doesn't matter, only the accolades you earn, thus you can usually earn more of the permanent points by ignoring the design of your tower and going for the accolades, which I find upsetting.  I really don't like that the best strategy is to completely ignore what you're supposed to be doing in the game.

I love this game so much. You use dice to build buildings. On your turn, you draft one die and draw from a bag to replace it. Three rounds of six turns each. You can score points by following your blueprint, you score round points depending on what materials (dice) you use. You can also get achievement scoring for doing certain things with your dice (such as building a tower of five or ore dice). So simple, different, and fun.

Blueprints is basically an abstract dice game, but an enjoyable one at that. You stack four types of dice, which mirror the building materials Wood, Stone, Glass, and Recycled Materials. You score points based on how you place the dice in the building on your blueprint, and bonuses depending on the scores they show, or their types. It's a good looking package, and plays quickly. It's an alright filler.

This plays like another great filler game. Easy to explain, easy to play, easy to remember the rules, short playing time. But there can be more in this game. You might want to figure out what your opponents are planning by determine the type of dice the gather. When you do this, this game will evolve from a filler game into a short, tactical game for experienced players. Only minor thing about this game, is the price. It’s way too high for what you get.

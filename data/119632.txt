After carefully playing a game, the rules start to sink in. , if everyone will score themselves, it reduces AP a little as one person isn't sitting around waiting for scores to come in. A gaming/card table might be best for 4 people. End of kitchen table OK for 2-3 because the cards get spread out quite a bit.

Iota is a mix of Qwirkle and Set, but much harder to grasp than both, and you need to think a lot more. I don’t like that there is just a single tile of each tile (as opposed to three in Qwirkle), because you then quickly know if you can make a lot (four in a row) and thereby double the points. And it’s not easy to do when there are so few tiles. Recarding the points, the scoring is a little weird… And I don’t like that the 4-tiles are worth, well, 4 times as much as the 1-tiles, making them automatically worth more (I’m actually considering just playing with every tile being worth 1 point). And I think it’s a bad design decision that you can double your points if you make a lot and if you play all of your tiles (although the latter is very, very hard) – and they stack! For instance I got 80 points in one turn, which is a lot considering you usually score around 15 or so… The rules even have an example of a play netting you 208 points. This is an instant-win, and I don’t like this. I definitely prefer Set and Qwirkle for their much lighter gameplay and easier scoring rules.

RATING: 7
An Iota tile has three attributes to a Qwirkle tile's two (number is added to color and shape), but Iota has only four examples of each attribute to Qwirkle's six. Where Qwirkle requires all examples of one attribute to be the same and all examples of the other attribute to be different in each row, Iota instead uses a Set-like placement rule that requires the examples of each of the three attributes to be either all the same or all different in each row.

The scoring is less like the incremental back-and-forth of Qwirkle and more like a Scrabble shootout, with megapoints possible for finishing a row or emptying your hand. With wild tiles entering, exiting, and re-entering the game, I can imagine Scrabble-like strategies of using many turns to discard/replenish your hand or to make low-point plays, hoping to draw a big scoring hand. I haven't tried that way of playing yet, though.

Tiny cards, but they need to be because the playing area is large. Fans of Set should check out this one.

A very portable little tile laying game - basically Advanced Qwirkle. The components are nice, although I'm not sure how useful the portability of the game is considering playing it still requires a fairly large table. The mechanisms of trying to place the right tile/card in the right spot are about the same as the other classic games of this type (Qwirkle/Scrabble) and are just as interesting, but the patterns you required to make with each row are much more diverse to the point that they actually get very hard to keep track of.

I play this solo a lot. My brain really enjoys pattern matching games, there's something very soothing about that type of activity. I also like how this game expands out into a grid as you play (although it can be challenging to fit if the table is small). It's an attractive game :)

I do feel like keeping track of all the possible patterns in the grid helps my brain agility - something I do think about as I age. So that's a plus.

It can get a little frustrating and feel like you don't have very good options for where to place your cards sometimes. 

I'd recommend Iota to anyone who enjoys games like SET. If pattern matching isn't your thing, you might not find it very interesting.

Qwirkle is a fine game of creating lines of tiles with like colors or like shapes. It runs a little long for what it is, but it is pleasant enough. Iota is similar in that you are creating lines of cards but with the 3 values (number, color, shape) all being either different or the same. Each line consists of a maximum of 4 (vs. 6 in Qwirkle) and so you would need to have the same colors and numbers, but different shapes. Or the same colors and different numbers and shapes. And so on in any combination of these three things. Matching 3 factors is a lot harder than matching 1 and so there is a lot of hunting and pecking and mentally placing cards and checking the fit in all directions. I just found it a lot of work for a game that really isn't too interesting. For this kind of a game, I'd rather have "pleasant and thoughtful" than "brain-burning and AP-prone". Honestly, I'd rather play Carc than either of them...

1/20th the size of Qwirkle but so close in gameplay that you don't need both. Kwatro adds in the patterns of Set, is more mathy and - as far as I remember my one play of Qwirkle - there should be more room for clever play in Kwatro although I read that it could degenerate with destructive play. The one element I don't like is the strength of jokers and that there's only two of them increasing the importance of luck of the draw noticeably.

Just like with [thing=287][/thing], you just have to concentrate like mad to the point that there's no table talk, none of the pleasant social interaction that makes games so enjoyable. I'm fine with games requiring deduction; I'm fine with games requiring mathematical thinking. But they have to have some fun built in, as well. The fun is the reason you play them. This one is too dry.

Love child of Qwirkle and Set - that pretty much sums it up. Has more interesting tactical decisions than Qwirkle as not all cards are created equal - higher point cards net you more money so you may want to spend turns discarding if you've got nothing but 1s in your hand.

Decent little cross between Set! and Scrabble (or Qwirkle). A bit luck dependent on the card draws, as some of the very high scoring plays require having just the right cards, but enough tactical thinking on each play to make it reasonably interesting. The very tiny package is nice for portability, though it does take up a fairly large playing area.

Cards (very small ones) on the table time:  I really should rate IOTA higher.  It's small, compact, portable, easy to learn, and fun, but it's also clever, tricky to master, and with a very surprising depth of strategy.  The only reason I don't put it any higher is because, ahem, I'm not very good at it.  The layout and placement strategy always leaves me stymied.  That said, I love to play it!

It's a very well-designed game with simple graphics, very portable -- a great vacation game.  It's so simple that it's almost a kid's game, but adults will find it challenging.  Don't trust me on this one; add it to your collection.

A neat little game that is basically Qwirkle but combined with SET-like pattern combinations of number, color, and shape.  Principally a hand management and tile laying game, and I like it more than Qwirkle as there is a bit more variability in the kinds of plays and moves you can make.  I’ve found the placement rules enables both more blocking and more potential moves, which opens up the decision space quite a bit.  The two wild cards add an interesting dynamic, and in 2-player games I’m tempted to have each player start with 1 wild card for balance purposes.  

I like that it comes in a TINY little tin.  Very portable and attractive package, although it belies the amount of table space it takes up.

Iota is a more complex Qwirkle in that a 3rd dimension is added to the features - so here we have colour, shape and number. 

Each turn the players will add one or more cards to a single line. When they do this they must ensure that all features are identical or all features in the line are different, the two cannot be mixed. 

A player then earns 1 point for each card in a line that they have added to...but should their placements have added to multiple lines, by joining 2 or more lines up,  (and in this case the placement rules must be adhered to in all lines) they score for each such line.

If a player is able to place the last card in a line (the 4th) they will double the normal points. 

I liked this game as it gave me more to think about than Qwirkle, which can leave me a little bored at times), but it does take a little more brain power and can leave you a little more drained. 

The down sidess of Iota are that the small cards are not as nice from a quality perspective as the chunky wooden tiles of Qwirkle (although it does allow for a tiny footprint by comparison). 

The other negative factor for me with Iota is that there is only 1 card of each type and that can make it much harder to form a 'lot' (row of 4) versus the row of 6 or 'qwirkle' of the other game.

A good abstract. Very simple rules, but a fair amount of tactics (and some strategy). I like that it doesn't feel like a lot of other abstract strategy games. It does run a little longer than I might prefer, and it can bog down near the end a little, but overall a very enjoyable game. Bonus points for being colorful, affordable, and compact (though you will need lots of table space to play).

Given a choice, I'd prefer to play Qwirkle. The addition of the numbers in Iota make it much more complicated. Qwirkle, being that bit simpler, plays smoother and is a little more enjoyable as a result.

That being said, Iota's still a fun game. Plus, as it comes in such a tiny tin, it's hard to find an excuse not to have it and take it anywhere.

The bastard love-child of Qwirkle and Set. Each turn you play as many cards from your hand to the table as you can, all in one row/column, and score each row/column you made or added to (Qwirkle style), The Set part is that each card has 3 attributes, and the second card in each row/column defines which attributes must be shared by all in that row/column; all other attributes must be different throughout. Adding the 4th (and last) card to a row/column doubles your turn score (which is otherwise the face value of all cards in all changed row/columns). This makes for wild scoring fluctuations and ultimately is the downfall of the game - your best and only strategy is to draw great cards that allow you to finish off rows/columns. Turns are otherwise spent assessing all possible places to play your cards, determining the best, and playing thus, a process which creates untoward downtime. Unfortunately, you can't escape the feeling that the game is playing you, which makes it a hard-sell for gamers, and the game is otherwise too non-exciting for non-gamers, which makes for a dire double-whammy.

This seems like an awesome travel game because it fits in such a tiny tin.  However, it requires a ton of table space, which limits its portability.  It feels like a hybrid of Qwirkle and Set.  Give the option, I'd probably play either of those games over this one, or ideally none of the above.

It's like Qwirkle, but even a little more complex as you have 3 dimensions (shape, color and number), but less colors (only 4). Games like Qwirkle are however not my favorite style of games.

RATING: 7
So pretty, cleverly designed, and the graphics seem simple but are sublimely perfect.  I've heard the term 'eye-candy' before but never really felt it until I saw this game in progress.  The design of the wilds looks matter-of-fact, but is a towering achievement.  Perfection.

The container continues the graphic niceness, and the tiny cards and instructions pack into this microscopic metal box.  This is great for our tiny cabin with very little space for storage of any kind.

The cards are just a bit too small to use easily (and hard to shuffle), yet just a bit too big to layout easily on a small table (note small cabin). And the game is not totally self-contained: you'll still need a pad and pencil for scoring.  Obviously there were trade-offs for that tiny box.  [[i]Update:[/i] after a dozen plays, the cards handle fine and seem perfectly sized--it just takes getting used to them.  Also, if you don't butt the cards, but overlay the white margins so only the center of each card is showing, the game takes MUCH less table space.]

The game is fun with 2, but suspect it will really come alive with 4.

Similar to qwirkle, but a little different, maybe a bit harder. On our 2nd play ever, 1st round, 3rd player's turn, they had no moves to make and had to draw(posted pic in game gallery). If this is some oddity we just happened into, ok, but if this happens with any frequency I'd consider it an issue to be sure. With variable points per tile it changes how you treat each tile. This means a draw of 4 point tiles is a stronger luck component, than qwirkle seems to have. Generally not bad, but I suspect qwirkle may be more approachable for most gamers.

RATING: N/A
Pros:
* Amazingly small
* Minimal setup (shuffle, deal, go)
* Fun pattern matching

Cons:
* I hate shuffling tiny square tiles. I end up just spreading them out on the table, mixing them around and then gathering them back up.
* I don't care for the scoring. Might try Qwirkle style scoring instead.

Overall Impression:
* Dunno. As an "activity", it's kind of fun. Not sure what it's like as a game yet.

= 2013-11-11

Haven't actually played it as a game yet, but as an "activity" (following the rules, but not keeping score), it's kind of fun.

The examples in the instruction booklet show players getting single, double and triple digit scores in a single turn. I'm concerned that the possibility of 200+ point turns would result in people taking multiple turns just swapping tiles in hoping to score big. This takes away some of the fun pattern matching and leaves you with a game where luck of the draw overshadows everything else. Note that I have no idea if this would actually happen in a game; perhaps the odds of getting all four down in a single turn is too low to consider or maybe you could just have a house rule that you can't swap tiles more than twice in a row.

RATING: 3
Very disappointing. I love the components, especially the size.

However, gameplay takes way too much space.

I think Scrabble type games without words undoubtedly fail is because the valid combinations are (a) much, much smaller, and (b) too easy to spot. So looking for possible moves feels tedious, and there are much less possible moves. Because there are much less possible moves, the game spreads all over the table, taking up way too much space, and players most of the time play the mindless two-card play.

Hopefully I could repurpose the cards to play a more compelling game.

RATING: 7.01
Smallest game I've seen.  I've never played Set (the other game that is similar to IOTA), so I consider this game to be Qwirkle with cards rather than tiles.  Basically, you take turns laying cards in grid patterns (scrabble style) making sure that each row created has all the same (or all different) values for each characteristic.

Qwirkle has two characteristics (shape and color) while IOTA has three characteristics (shape, color, and numbers)

Qwirkle has 6 possibilities for each characteristic while IOTA has 4 possibilities for each characteristic (circle, triangle, square, cross) (red, blue, yellow, green)  (1,2,3,4).

The other major difference is when you complete an entire row of 4 cards, you double your score for the entire turn (it's not just an adder like in Qwirkle).  Note that scores on your turn can be doubled two, or even three times.

One other difference is Qwirkle scoring is just based on # of tiles, but IOTA you add the number on the tiles to get your score.

One other thing that IOTA has that Qwirkle does not is a wild card....which is extremely powerful (OP?).  Also, once the wildcard is played, it can be replace with the card that it represents....so the wildcard can be played multiple times in the same game.  

I think I prefer Qwirkle due to the tactile nature of the game (I like the tiles better than cards).  The thing I prefer about IOTA is the portable nature of it.   It is tiny and comes in a small tin.  So you can throw it in a backpack or pocket very easily.

IOTA is a good game for what it is...recommended (especially at that price point).

Looks a lot like Qwirkle, but now with an additional dimension (number of objects) to match the pieces. Makes it even more difficult to have an overview of the game. Luck is an important figure. Drawing low values or not being able to create a Kwatro makes it impossible to win.

A solid little abstract using rules similar to SET, but more game-like (vs. SET being more puzzle-like).  Still, I don't feel like I'm making choices so much as just making pretty patterns.  That's not the worst thing to happen in a game, but it's not what I'm looking for.

Nice that it's a tiny box, and the basic idea is fine (Qwirkle/Scrabble with valid words being like in Set), but it takes up much too much table space since cards are bigger than Scrabble or Qwirkle tiles! It also seems to have too much luck of the draw. Qwirkle is better.

You need to be very sharp and fresh to embark on this game. It's a very thinky game, with a huge footprint despite the tiny tin it comes in. I use an app to keep track of the scoring. The wildcards are a confusion because it becomes complicated to track whether the actual card a wildcard represents has surfaced or not. In fact half the time we are trying to determine whether a certain spot is "dead". Good to use markers for those "dead" spots. Not for the faint-hearted, because it is extremely mentally taxing, and you definitely won't want to play it twice in a roll. That being said, it is a very clever game that those who enjoy strategic games will love.

Kwatro certainly takes a bit of getting used to, but already my second game played much better that the first. Halfway through the game you have to have a keen eye to identify the best spots for your cards. Especially if you don't want to succumb to analysis paralysis. I am not a big fan of abstracts, but the fact that the amount of points that you can score each turn can vary greatly(!), this game does not feel as dry as most. In addition, my 10-year old son really likes it.
UPDATE: Played again after a while, and the abstractness of the game leaves me a tad cold. My girlfriend, however, likes it and is also pretty good at it!

Kind of like Set crossed with Continuo. I guess it may resemble Qwirkle, which I have not played. Good puzzley game. I think there might be a little too much luck in that if you draw a lot of 4s you will have the best opportunities. Idea: add to your score (before doubling) 2 points per card played. That might lead people to never, ever discard, though.
The box says 2-4 players, but we played once with 5 and it worked fine - if you are impatient or prone to AP, downtime would be an issue with that many, but in terms of the rules there's no reason you couldn't play with 5-6.

There are not many meaningful decisions to be made with the way scoring works. First, check if able to use all four cards and/or form a line of four. If not, place your highest card with another card in an L shape so that you can score the highest card twice.

Downtime is high and gets higher as the game progresses. Player interaction is low.

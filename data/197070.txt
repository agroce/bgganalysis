Massive Darkness has some really fun dice rolling combat, a fantastic loot system, and a great level up progression within a single scenario.

It does take a bit longer than necessary.  And I have to say this game is WAY overproduced.  The minions are basically glorified health trackers.  I wouldn't buy this myself but I'd enjoy playing it again if it went faster.

RATING: 8
Excellent components. Good gameplay in general, may require minor house rules depending on what you are expecting from the game. The game is a very good sandbox for tweaks as well.  By default it's a great dice chucker and thematic.

Edit: house rules might be needed for solo play at later quests 
At 3-4 players no house rules are needed so far (quest 1-3)

RATING: 6
The minis are great (that was expected). Other game components are good.
Gameplay wise I must say I am a bit disappointed. It really feels easy, You don't really need to plan ahead, it's a total dice chucker. I think it doesn't have the magic I felt in other dungeon crawlers I played (Descent 2nd edition, Sword & Sorcery).

I think it can be a good game to play with friends when no one wants to play a heavy game but just roll some dices and spend some time together. I would not recommend it to play solo, and even less if you look for a challenge.

Edit: sold it. Gets way to fiddly past half the game. You spend more time counting than playing

[1-6] This is exactly what I was looking for in a dungeon crawl. Hack n' slash with limited fiddlyness with direct references to Heroquest and Dungeons & Dragons. It's got a classic feel and will be perfect for family gaming sessions sneaking in the dark and squashing some goblins.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I'm not a fan of dungeon crawlers in general. I hated the first Zombicide and I disliked Black Plague. Still I decided to give a chance to Massive Darkness, the third installment of the series... and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Cool Mini learned a lot of lessons from the game's predecessors.

As always with CMON, component quality is off the charts. The game of course comes with a ridiculous amount of miniatures but also artwork, tokens and cards are excellent. I'm not one of those people that go nuts when they see a box full of plastic, but objectively the value of the production here is amazing.

Gameplay-wise Massive Darkness considerably improves upon the Zombicide formula. The biggest improvements, in my opinion, are:
1) They got rid of the dumb loot mechanism, that forced you to start the game always in the same exact way... aka entering a room and searching without end until your character is a killing machine. Now to find new equipment you have to open doors and fight.
2) The enemies are not a mindless wall of meat anymore. There's far more variety and the fact that the boss of every group has a weapon makes the game more challenging and re-playable. This mechanism is really clever!
3) The combat is more fun thanks to the custom dice. It's not just window dressing. The standard six-sided dice from Zombicide lead to an unbelievably boring and repetitive combat, because all you did was check if you inflicted damage. The new dice instead include the possibility of activating special abilities, with the boom and diamond symbols. This mechanism makes the combat more interesting, more exciting and far less repetitive.
4) Finally there's no more idiotic enemy mitosis when they cannot decide where to go nor the infamous "you shoot your allies first" rule.

Therefore I enjoy Massive Darkness much much more than Zombicide Black Plague. It's still an extremely long dice rolling game in which you kill horde of monsters after horde of monsters, but at least the game is more challenging and the dice rolling is more dynamic. It's still not my style, because I don't enjoy doing the same thing (rolling dice to kill monsters) over and over and over again for 2 hours... but in this genre Massive Darkness offers the best system I've tried so far. It's actually good!

Individual games are fine but it takes too much time deciding what new weapon to use or whatnot because in the first few rounds you need every advantage you can get. The first door is always the hardest. Mid to late game you're making paste out of all the minions. 
In campaign play I'd suggest only running 5 games as the micro experience is 1/5th normal. EITHER RUN THROUGH THE EVEN OR ODD numbered quests as the higher numbered quests have more artifacts which grant more actions. Besides either quest 9 or 10 would be a good finale if you weren't overpowered. We ran the whole 10 and lost one of the first few but pretty much didn't need to think about any situation. Whoever got to the minions or monster first got the kill. I played a sorcerer, by the end I was pushing 10+ auto wounds. (Bypassing defence if that mattered.) my highest damage output in one attack was 20 and the battle Wizard matched it once.

Disregard comments about how easy this game is. Most people don't properly play with all the rules, the most awful mistakes being not using micro xp in campaign mode and not counterattacking. This game deserves a bit of criticism but not the trashing it is getting.

The game needs a bit of polish, and campaign mode is only useful for 3 or 4 scenarios before needing to reset due to the heroes getting too overpowered. But if you still think the game is easy, the scenarios are increasingly difficult, so go try maps 8, 9 and 10 in campaign mode or 10 in single scenario mode.

I'd love to see a season 2 improving some of the core rules, but still making use of all the cards and miniatures available now.

Massive Darkness plays like a "heavier" Zombicide for adults. Every time you play, the experience is different. You have to be able to play cooperatively and strategically clever, but winning still takes an extra bit of good luck, so there is an element of randomness to spice things up. Very enjoyable.

Played three or four times.  Its a good, light dungeon crawl.  Lots of loot and easy rules.  Sword and Sorcery LITE.  

I enjoy it a lot more than Sword and Sorcery for a one-off dungeon crawl - easier to manage, quicker pace.

Played again and the big game is where its at.  The last scenario is long, and level 4 and 5 equipment is fun. Going to have to generate some larger scenarios going forward.

I wasn't sure about this game when I first played the tutorial but I must say our group had an absolute blast playing the first quest and we are all looking forward to playing the next scenario.  The campaign mode is a bit of a let down but it does make the game a bit more challenging as the skill progression is slowed down quite a bit.  The difficulty of the first quest seemed to be perfectly balanced; it kept us all in suspense and never felt too easy or too difficulty.  Our party wiped out at the last room because our beat-stick barbarian got a little to full of himself and the paladin was not close enough to jump in front and take the beating.  Obviously this is an early judgement of the game, but I am very please with it thus far.

Provisional rating, I'm experimenting with house rules to improve the 'story mode'.

Basic game out of the box is fine (and a 8/9 for me) but I want the linked quests/progression. As it stands the story mode doesn't work (well 2 player anyway), you level too fast and get too much equipment meaning after a couple of quests you're  almost max level ...

Fortunately this is the usual CMON sandbox game, so there is lots of opportunity to customise it to what I want :)

* Update, yep Story mode as per the rules is junk - characters level up far too quickly, mobs die far too easily (at least in 2 player), you get flooded with equipment. All of this is fun in regular mode, but story mode just doesn't work. It feels tacked on and rushed, needing more development :(

Shame, had lots of promise. For now an '8' but if I get story mode working with a set of variant rules it may go up.

** Update, despite reservations still playing this - and tinkering with house rules to 'fix' story mode. Base game (pick a quest and done) is fine, and I think better than Zombicide BP, but I really want the linked quests/story progression. For now it's up to a 9, and if I crack it probably a 10.

*** Update, yep now a 10 with my variant rules :)
https://boardgamegeek.com/file/download/w8c6y8oc0a/MD_variants.pdf

**** Update - most played game now, and I'm working on random quest generator after having gone through the official quests (although I'm fine redoing them with a different set of characters). Solid 10 but only if you're prepared to house rule the 'story mode' which is just broken after about 3 quests if you use the rules as written :/

Update. Sold.
I wanted to like this game so much. Had high hopes as we love Black Plague. The problem is that there are much better games out there. Sword and Sorcery, The Undercity, Shadows of Brimstone, Gloomhaven and for an evening RPG experience Gloom of Kilforth.
The biggest problem (for me) is that the game feels like a chore. I really dislike the scaling factor by multiplying the number of heroes to set the health of bosses and agents and to a lesser extent using the same multiplying formula for deciding the number of spawning minions. 
If you are in Asia and interested in the KS edition shoot me a message. Nevermind ... already sold.

RATING: 2
Game is sadly extremely disappointing. The game is very simplistic and tedious. There is no risk reward in the game. Progression in the game is very poor and you become godlike very quickly. Even the strongest monster in the game doesn't have any way to kill the players once you are about half way through any of the quests. Sadly I will have to create my own rules to make this game even moderately satisfying. I cannot recommend this game to anyone.

Mildly disappointed by this one, even if I still have fun playing it. Like Zombicide and Z:BP, the game is still simply too easy, especially now that players get a resurrect option. Like its predecessors, enemies (apart from the roaming monsters) aren't that difficult to defeat, and treasures are way too abundant; at least in MD they have finally scaled the game for player count and have limited search actions, but there is still just too much free loot for the characters, IMO.

I really hate the new "transmute" action: it not only makes the game easier, and far more fiddly, but it makes no thematic sense: "I'm going to magically turn this sword and potion into a shield... without using an action!" You might as well make players automatically shoot allies when making ranged attacks... :whistle:

Nevertheless, it's still light, trashy fun. The minis are awesome, and the theme comes across. I can't say the huge expense is justified, however, for what can't be described as anything more than just a "pretty good" game.

RATING: 7
Light dungeon crawler but I enjoyed my first 3 plays.  The first scenario was tough for the two random heroes I selected - and harder when I forgot that I could revive one.  Still enjoyed it as a tutorial.  The first real scenario is a bit long for what it provides but was fun to play.  Third with time pressure was much better gaming experience with more tension.  I can see that the event deck needs a bit more likelihood of a monster and I think I'm going to add at least +1 creature to each mob spawn (if not +# = to tile number).
I'm also very glad I bought the whole thing.  The base random monsters are solid but the expansion ones are really fun.  Air elemental and cockatrice are particularly fun.  The oni with a shield was hard to bring down.  I think HP = modifier x (#heroes + tile number) will probably how I home rule it.
Overall though, very fun for what it intends to be: a very light dungeon crawler.

RATING: N/A
Game really lacks drama or intensity. Lots of things to remember. And in most games I either get wiped out early or just steam roll through the dungeon. The Boss monsters and high level roaming monsters just get torn to shreds.

So many good components, just lackluster design. No desire to play the campaign. Hey you learned a skill! But you forget it until you get to the appropriate level of the dungeon to balance it. . . :(

A fun, somewhat forgiving dungeon crawler with a huge range of detailed miniatures that made the kickstarter pledge well worth it. The game itself becomes a tad tame once you get used to how the monsters activate, and normally by the time your party is approaching the final stages of a dungeon, you will be so armed to the teeth that even the greater roaming monsters can perish in one good round. 

I highly recommend homebrewing rules such as: removing all good events from the events deck, allowing guardians to mulligan one treasure if they draw one they cannot use, permadeath (although this will result in player elimination which is not that fun), etc etc. I do not regret kickstarting this at all, have played it several times and plan to potentially use the minis in future DnD campaigns. The darkness is massive, and full of terrors, but our shadow barbarian had a level 5 greatsword so now they're all dead.

This game has surprised me. I expected less from it. I thought it will be much more similar to Black Plague which is not the case.

This has some very good design upgrade compared to Z:BP like the XP system, counter attack system, no friendly fire, trash loot transmutation etc. It is not easy at all. I'm really happy I've backed this one. I even considered to sold Z:BP because what I liked in that game I get from this one too with upgrades.

Update:
At the end, it fails as a campaign game. It is definitely too easy during a campaign.

If you like thematic fun games that are not to hard to learn this is a must-have! It's set in the same universe as zomibicide black plague but it really stands on it's own. It might not be the most difficult game in my collection but i will always enjoy playing so i gave it a 10.

Light dungeon crawler. Basically like playing stylised Diablo as a co-op board game. 
Some cool mechanics but also some horrendously rushed rules that have made for immediate house rulings to lower things like treasure counts and to counter monsters becoming no threat too quickly.

What a fun game it is. It's smooth, plays fast, is fun and intense. Why not rate it a 10, because the rules and the components (mini's) are worth a 10? Well it's the missions. They are really bad. In the intro scenario you are already king of the game, just to discover in mission 2, you can't use any of your cool stuff. The story is none existing, no fun and dry. They just pasted in some random story. You can tell because after the scenario's there is another section of the rules. I didn't even read them at first because I thought they were done explaining the rules.

Does that make it a bad game? No, not at all. It is so easy to create your own random dungeons, make up your own story and have tons of fun with battling monsters, making tactical decisions and leveling up that this is my favorite sandbox games in years. But....it's not meant to be a sandbox game. So although I love the game how I play it now myself and having fun with it and want to play it over and over, it's not worth a score of 10 because it wasn't intended the way I play it.

Should I buy it? Should I play it? Definitely Yes! But create your own adventure, it will give you ours of great fun! Use your imagination and you will never be disappointed. Do the missions and you will get bored, frustrated and missing out a super fun game!

I hate to rate this game so considering I was a Kickstarter supporter, but it is simply too fiddly. The combat basically boils down to dice rolls like many other games such as Descent, yet you have to keep track of modifiers on five different or more different cards to determine your outcome: your character's card, your class sheet, your gear, your enemy's card, and their gear. It's simply too much to keep track of and slogs the game down entirely. 

Like many others have commented, I think the idea of making a Diablo-style board game sounded great on paper (made me drop $250+ on it), but the fiddly complexity doesn't translate to cardboard. I believe Arcadia Quest has a much more refined yet similiar system which is much more enjoyable to play.

Some mention of the game being a bit easy particularly at the lower counts has been experienced, however it's still been fun. Balance issues are worse in competitive games, and though it's good to be challenged, two hour coops that end in a damp defeat leave a sour taste, so I dont care about the balance, the fact it works at all is quite impressive as there's really a lot going on in this game, but it's about as trim as I think it can be. The different classes, the loot system and the ai monsters are all good in my opinion. The map tiles are gorgeous, the game works mostly around cards rather than tokens, which I prefer, though makes the game a massive table hog - as you might have expected from the title. It does feel like an evolution of the Black Plague system, however I largely prefer that game. 

This game game has the advantage of not requiring you to control multiple heroes at the lower player count unlike Black Plague. It's perhaps a richer, and a more complicated game, with a large variety of enemies. It has the long set up, and also the rule book which is designed for reading but not cross referencing from. The minis are also great  and there is a lot from them. I would even say that you could happily just play the core and feel like you had enough variety. 

However, Black Plague is simpler and more fun in my opinion. I find myself wanting to play it over this. The fact that the zombies just suck up hits without defence rolls, speeds up everything in that game, and the ai is simpler to run. I am not necessarily saying this is better: it just leads to a better game experience in my mind  that can be shared with a greater variety of people. The games are similar enough that I don't feel the need to own both long term. I haven't tried the campaign and probably never will, I generally don't really delve into that side of games, so perhaps I am missing out. The wizard is my favourite.

Great dungeon crawl, especially if you're new to to that kind of game. The Miniatures and components are off the chart awesome but it is from CMON. My main knock on it would be it's extremely challenging starting out but doesn't take long and becomes extremely easy. It does get repeatative. It really reminds me of Diablo the video game.

What to say about Massive Darkness...For those that have played the computer game Diablo, you'll find much to like here because that is what I am reminded of. Heroes looking for cool gear, constantly swapping them out looking for better and cooler combinations frantically slashing through enemies looking for even more and better gear. For those looking for a dungeon crawl you need to look elsewhere because this game has more to do with video games and arcade games than a board dungeon crawl. And I think that's where the game failed to deliver, on expectations. If CMoN emphasized the arcade nature of the game, that it had closer ties to Gauntlet and Diablo it would make more sense. For me, I'm just waiting for shops to clear out stock at a discount so I can finish up the few items I'd like to round everything out.

The game is just too long and after a tense beginning tends to turn into a snoozefest of inevitability.  If more of the quests were like 2, 4, 5, this would score much higher, but too many of the missions are more of the "get gear and skills to completely overmatch the AI" variety.  Final turns wind up being you standing toe to toe with whatever poor monster just spawned while you pound it into submission in a single activation.

Good class design, and a really good job on the hero design. Miniatures are awesome. I backed on kickstarter so I got some good value with the crossover pack.  This will not be replacing the D&D AS games in my collection.

I want to love this game... but it just isn't balanced thoroughly... in a way that finishing a scenario is a drag as you know it's not even that hard after you leveled up and gotten the correct equipment. I expected much more from this... but seeing how they changed the game this much during the past year, I highly doubt they got enough playtime in to test the changes enough.

:(

Will try out some of the alternative rules others have come up with to see if those improve the game enough. Now it's just a glorious pile of plastic that will not see the table in the condition it's in.

After a couple of game plays, I can tell that the game is fun, but it does not spark. Moments of story telling never came, as it has done for Black Plague, its predecessor. Much of its problem is that the story/game play is so linear. Open room A, open room B, open room C etc. The roaming monster spawn in the same space/one space in front/one space behind. The heros have to hack through the monster, as the tactical decisions are relative simple. Yes BP is a somehow simpler, but that is one reason it plays more diverse. And I wanted MD to be diverser in gameplay, not in figures and rules. Massive Darkness is a nice Hack&Slash game I'll play, when I'm in the mood. The game as such will though one day be one of many.

Walked into Brookhurst Hobbies in O.C CA and they were shrink-wrapping a Kickstarter version with all the goodies of this game for PRICE!  For PRICE!  I wasn't going to buy it, really didn't need it, but I love Zombicide: Black Plague, and the game I wanted to buy they didn't have (had a bunch of the expansions tho).  So I just looked at it, just a quick gaze, and it called, beckoned, and I, well, bought it.  And now I need to play it - or convert it somehow to Z:BP.

new update: MAYBE DELIVERY in JULY 2017!!!


Edit during the campaign, only 10 days left...
"Boring..., just boring. I was so excited and couldn't await this KS but it seems for me the worst CMoN KS ever... (And I backed a lot and I'm still a huge fan of Zombicide (and will be)) but this... 
Another boring monster as 100K stretch goal? Absolute disappointed what this KS is offering till now, and time is running.
Also, maybe this is only my feeling..., but I joined never a CMoN campaign with so many people "crying" and express their negative comments about this KS...
Hey CMoN, wake up and turn this project around fast. Only 10 days..."

I may not cancel my pledge, but I will surely limit to the minimum as a simple add-on for Black Plague use. It's a pity.

Avanzas una casilla saqueas habitaciones de izquierda a derecha, te chetas de objetos,(TRANSMUTANDOLOS , una regla absurda) y cuando chocas con un monstruo te tiras 3 o cuatro turno con todos los jugadores tirando dados, hasta que el azar termine.

Nagyon féltem tőle az értékelések alapján. Egy túl könnyű, nem balanszolt zombicide klónnak hittem, és már agyaltam, hogy mi legyen a KS pledge-emmel. Hát semmi, megtartom, mert ez egy nagyon hangulatos, jól összerakott dunegeon crawler. Túl könnyűnek semmiképp se mondanám, pont jó a nehézség. Persze lefolyástól függően ingadozhat, de semmi extrém nem volt benne. A játékmenet sokkal több agyalást kíván, mint a buta zombicide, és az ellenfelek is sokkal változatosabbak, sőt a karik is. Egyetlen kicsi fájdalmam, hogy igazán írhattak volna valami minimál sztorit a questekhez, hogy ne csak ide menj, ezt vedd fel, oda vidd érzés legyen. (ja és közben ülj meg mindenkit)

Story-Mode is totally broken. In Mission 1 we get Level 3, In Mission 2 we get Level 5. Maximum Level. We were through all decks, we had the best loot and the two Sets. And there are 8 Missions left. The beginning was hard, we died two times. Between Level 2 and Level 3 was the time we were immortal. We haven't get a wound, no one. Game is total easy.

Mid- to Late-Game you spend more time to check your skills and do the math rather  playing the game. 

Need massive house rules.

In contrast to the lightness of the rules, the pace of this one perplexed me. I finished reading the rulebook & thought to myself: "Yeah, this sounds like something streamlined, slick, ye ol' clunky dungeon crawl distilled down to a loot-happier Zombicide, transforming it into something more like Diablo: The Board Game. Let's get this played!"

Then I jumped into the first few games and the tempo just lumbered in awkward fits & starts. 

This pace matched the collision between the video-gamey promise of [i]constant[/i] loot drops and level ups and the harsh reality of how numbing and uninteresting that becomes in cardboard form -- at least in the fussy manner that it was realized here. 

It quickly shifts from dopamine rush to a tryptophan coma, becoming work that's difficult to inhabit from turn-to-turn since your characteristics are constantly shifting. You're not given a chance to appreciate & fully use that last, amazing loot drop because the next amazing loot drop needs to be compared to it. It [i]shouldn't[/i] feel like work, and it isn't... when the medium is a video game. In cardboard format either the pace of loot drops needs to slow or the presentation of character state needs to be much more clean and efficient, making decisions faster and easier.

As it stands, the design breaks immersion and doesn't feel all that playful or evocative. It replaces this with constantly scaling "busywork" that masks the act of doing [i]mostly[/i] nothing more than throwing the dice that your cards tell you to throw & picking a skill proc every once in awhile. 

The simplicity of these decisions is fine; in fact in the case of Zombicide, the design doesn't obfuscate this and it feels more confident, immersive, and fun as a result. In MD, all of the work surrounding that core decision loop is comparatively overwrought, scattered, and distracting. 

Rooms full of gear are constantly uncovered & deliberated over. XP is constantly being examined at the end of the round for the next expense on a linear skillup shopping list (where multiple tracks all fill up at mostly the same pace under the constant stream of XP). Combat always pauses as modifiers from multiple cards and reference sheets are compiled, special abilities remembered (since there are new ones [i]every damn turn[/i]), and this gets worse with every level as adjustments and procs scale up in number & magnitude. 

What sounds cool and Diabloesque on paper in reality becomes harried text-scanning, providing less of a feeling of actively or positively choosing from a smorgasbord of tactical choices but more like trying to [i]not[/i] screw yourself out of money on a tax form. "Let's see... am I missing anything?" was uttered during nearly every single round of combat at the table, followed be another minute of looking at gear cards, character cards and character sheets. 

This may get better with repeated plays but at this point the contrast between the rules and the reality of this game is one of the starkest that I've experienced in recent board gaming memory. The glass slipper just does not seem to fit.

I do need to play this some more to see if the pacing issues resolve themselves over time.

Edit: well the pacing gets a [i]little[/i] better but the broken, volatile balance and lack of real decisions in these XP Corridors Of Dice Chucking does not. It's like this was designed with a repertoire of dungeon-crawl ideas that only included Zombicide and Descent but the design still couldn't accomplish a melding of the two that preserved any kind of satisfying agency or even drama. Nothing comes to a head in this game. You either punch through the first 1 or 2 experience levels and steamroll the rest of the scenario, or some random catastrophe crushes your progress somewhere in those early stages. The end. The only real decision in this game lies in how many turns you want to spend pulverizing XP piñatas before moving to the next (and usually the only available) tile and leveling up the mobs and loot.

It's surprising how much was poured into producing this, seemingly without dedicating some solid sessions with one or two knowledgeable designers/developers who could balance things out and provide some ideas... [i]any ideas[/i]... beyond the bland, decision-free, overly busy, generic fantasy-fest that we ended up with. Armchair designers can already see that the dice system is broken. That would have taken a single consultation session with someone who understood dice & design to suggest something else. Who finished a test game of this and [i]didn't[/i] immediately come away with that bizarre emulsion of plodding play time and easy-mode gameplay reeling in their brain? 

Sure, it all kinda... works but it's unfortunate that no one took it upon themselves to pull that necessary rip-cord during QA, assessing the definite potential for un-fun and simply placing this on the backburner for some more design time.

Upgrading heroes across quests makes no sense either - you can get Lvl4 items at the end of one dungeon and not be able to use them until right at the end of the next.

The kids will probably love this. Kickstarted with everything that wasn't duplicates in the campaign.
The list of add-ons is quite long...both hero and enemy boxes, the Z:BP exclusives, 2 sets of marbled dice, plastic tokens, elementals (yeah, despite the price), bridges and doors.

It's been a while since I've had the funds to back a big KS like this. I'm pretty excited to paint all those massive monsters. This can't come soon enough.
I also have never dove all-in on the Kickstarter since Rivet Wars (what a shame, too - great minis, awful game) like this one either.

At the very least this will make for a very fun painting project, and a good game to play with the kids. And yes, I am rating this before I even own it. This is based on the desire to play, and it will most-likely see a large amount of play in this house.

I took my time making the decision to back this, and it has been a very long while since I have heavily invested in any game, or a Kickstarter. My feelings are founded on what I have seen concerning the game play, and how this is the kind of dungeon crawler I have been looking for. So, yes, it's already a '10' based on that alone - I don't make decisions like this lightly when it concerns this large an amount of initial investment in the game. I suspect it won't disappoint.

Package received. Expectations on model quality are far exceeded. The models are incredible and worth the pledge price without the game attached.

Gameplay Observations:
This is exactly what I expected, and was looking for in a dungeon crawler. My wife and kids can tolerate the length, and the complexity, which means it's a winner.

It doesn't overstay its' welcome, and despite what others might say, I found it pretty balanced so far. Although we have played only with 4 characters, and to me it feels that's where this game was tested the most.

This is Diablo in a board game. Do not mistake it for anything else, and you won't be disappointed. It's fun. You kill lots of dudes, get lots of items, and get to min/max your character as you venture through each dungeon.

If you are looking for a good, and solid persistent campaign, look elsewhere. The Story Mode feels tacked on, and will require some house-ruling to get it to work right. I personally wasn't looking for a persistent campaign system, and this game works perfectly for a one-off in which you can build your character and get cool items to make them killing machines.

This is the D&D RPG experience boiled down to it's basic parts, and can be played in one to two hours. This is perfect for going from zero-to-hero in a single session.

Scenarios can also provide a better experience. Choose wisely when introducing the game to more seasoned gamers. Quests, 2, 5, and 9 stand out as particularly good, and they provide a greater challenge and more strategy than most of the other scenarios. Skip the tutorial, and Quest 1, and jump right into quest 2 if you can parse the rules - you will have a much better experience of what the game is able to provide.

Still holding at a 10, and the models are some of the nicest generic fantasy models around. A blast to paint, with very little clean up, and fills needed.

So far it's a thumbs up from my entire family. Myself, and the kids are itching to play every day.

Feels like Baby's First Dungeon Crawler, right down to the brightly-coloured dice.   Utterly awful gameplay; tedious, dull and random - but never in an exciting way.

This is my favorite non campaign dungeon crawl. It and Gloomhaven (my favorite campaign dungeon crawl) are the only fully co-op dungeon crawl games I think are done right.  The campaign mode of Massive Darkness is bad; however playing each level in the campaign (but starting with fresh heroes each time) is a ton of fun.  Progression is fast and meaningful within one game.  Combat is simple, but on your turn there are meaningful choices to make.  The minis are gorgeous.  Time in game is good if no one in your group is horrendously slow.

I was lucky enough to catch the Kickstarter- and having all the extra roaming monsters does add a lot of variety to the game.  However given that all monsters come out with random equipment on them, I'd give the base game at least an 8.

So you know where I sit with dungeon crawls for reference:
I like Descent, but would rather play DnD 5e than a 1 vs all dungeon crawl.  Super Dungeon explore's full co-op rules are not great.  Castle Ravenloft (and its ilk) are good games, but feels more like puzzles than a dungeon crawl.

The rules could have been written more clearly. Much text, where a simple table or graphic was better. And I think the rules need some tweaking so this  game can really shine. Some problems: the amount of treasures (Door cards) does not scale with amount of players (monsters do).   In our first three player game we felt flooded with treasures. The AI of monsters;  you easily can avoid dealing with them by standing with your heroes out of line of sight in the shadow. Monsters will head down to the starting zone which is surely empty after two rounds. Until it comes back (exit zone) you're gone. AI should be smarter (predecessor Zombicide has better AI).
Also the monsters/mobs do not evolve like the heroes.  At start it seems difficult with starting gear, but as soon you have level 3 weapons you take down a mob in a single turn. Story mode is questionable:  your progress will be slower, saying that, the first quest will be really difficult, the second maybe mediocre, but surely starting the third one means that you will have already the best gear available so it starts being a cakewalk.  And what are your goals during the next quests?  Surely not as much play tested at it should have been. No thoughts about balancing, CMON?
What bothers me in terms of gameplay is that you as a hero deal only with two entities: either monsters or treasure. This can get stale soon. I wished there was more to interact with (Items that change a room from light to dark and vice versa (a torch)) or just using some kinda tools (f.i. a trap token for monsters, which lose health when stepping into) or furniture for barricades or similar. Or that rooms can have special traits (you heal there or lose something when staying there). Or shuffling a special mission based item into the treasure deck to be found etc.
Rule Tweaks:  
1) at least with fewer players don't get all the treasures in a zone  with a single action.
2) at level 1 or 2 monsters may go first to the starting zone, but starting with level 3 it should head first to the exit zone (and then come back).
3) last blow kill item held by monster falls down in zone where monster is is killed, no automatic "teleport" to hero with ranged attacks, it must me picked up.
4) more to come

Based on the amount of fun and excitement I got, I should give it a 10 - my first kickstarter, I have spent endless hours reading all the infos, looking at photos and videos and thinking about this game.
The box is here and I am as excited as my 4 and 6 year old kids (I removed a few minis to keep them sane). 
I have only played the tutorial with them and we were having a blast, although I had to houserule a bit because the 4 yr old wanted to play the monsters - easily done in this game, we also gave him a board.
One could argue that the way we played was not the original intent, but we are having so much fun with this big mad box...

Good game, but some rules could be writen better. Especially the special atacks/defenses. Problem we noticed is that in story mode, you will max-out too fast. And they are missing level 6 items/monster for extra challenge in later quests. 
Single Quests are fun and fast to play.

RATING: 6
Played 10+ times now, originally was amazing, but the game is too easy with zero tension building up as the game goes on unless you get super unlucky in the first few turns of the game - as theres no tension and choices are very obvious it makes the game fairly bland.

The amazing minis help make it more entertaining throughout, but then the game takes 3-4 hours to play (minimum unless you die early or you're playing a time limited scenario (there's about 2-3 of these in the book)

Combat is wayyy too convoluted for a simple dice system, can take 60 seconds+ to work out what you have rolled due to so many adjustments being made to the dice roll which again just draws out how long the game takes.

Overall, meh, wont say no to the game, but not interested in seeking out future games anymore.

Massive Darkness just takes everything we loved about that and improves on what went before while adding so much glorious new. Yes there are a few things with the rules that need a bit of working out but once you're solid you're REALLY solid, the mechanics are excellent. And the components are just WOW. The design, artwork, the miniatures... 

LOVE this game. Very, very, VERY impressed. And yes it IS a game, no it isn't a puzzle, for crying out LOUD.

Minis are great.  The board tiles are really great (I love a good board, even more than minis).  Played solo twice (tutorial quest).  Looks like I'll be able to play solo without necessarily running more than one character which I like.  Very hopeful this will be a good casual dungeon crawler with the kids and a good solo game.

Really did not take to this game.

Drags on too long and gets tedious. Several players left the table to watch TV. 

It is not the length of the game that is the issue as we play other games that are long,  Zombicide takes around the same length of time but is far more fun. 

Not really any tension in the game, baddies turned up and were wiped out by the first player to come across them. Treasure was found but was all a bit same-y.

Any treasures we found were just cycled through to get the next level up. 

Leveling up characters was ok but I kept forgetting what each character could do, what their Bams did, what happened when they were in shadow mode, what their special skill was etc.

Miniatures all look very similar, nicely made though. Will use them for Zombicide.

Played about three times after the initial trial game.Probably won't hit the table again.

I don't enjoy the kind of tactical decisions you get in this game. You are often in a position where some enemy you cannot possibly defeat is spawned and coming at you down a corridor. You have to try to game the system to get them to move past you. It's not at all thematic or fun.

Quite pleased with the ease of play and the enormous variety on offer in the KS package.  Breezy and easy to play and it is very satisfying how the characters go from zeros to powerhouses over the course of a scenario.  So far the scenarios have been well-designed (when played with 4 heroes) and have avoided the "samey samey" feeling that afflicted Zombicide: Black Plague.

Media partida.

Un juego de mazmorras, muy al estilo Zombicide. Jugamos media partida porque llevábamos un par de horas o 3 de partida y todavía nos faltaba la mitad del mapa. Éramos 6 jugadores y se hizo demasiado largo... supongo que a 3-4 jugadores sería mucho mejor.

Le pongo un 7 porque no pintaba mal, con personajes que van subiendo de nivel y desbloqueando nuevas y mejores habilidades que poder aprender. Quedo a la espera de probarlo bien, aunque el precio es un poco desorbitado.

I like this game with 2-3 players. More would be too boring and too much downtime. You are invested in your character and maybe 1-2 others but more would be overload.

I got a kickstarter copy of this game after the pledge manager had closed. The number of miniatures in this game exceed anything else in my collection. They are quality, but all were lighter than I expected knowing other CMON games. Massive Darkness is a true Ameri-trash game in the same vein of Zombicide Black Plague. This time though, its not just zombies we have to worry about. Goblins, trolls, dwarves, reptile men and barbarians lurk behind every corner while terrifying monsters roam the halls and dungeons, looking for heroes to devour. It scales very well and works best as a one-shot game. If you are a completionist, beware! There is a lot to this game. Between the two, I'd say Black Plague is simpler, but harder. I also prefer BP to Massive Darkness but will gladly play either and the excessive amount of compatibility these two have with one another makes it so that both have a spot in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Let's start off with the good, quality of models are outstanding, the first level of the game is challenging. Alright, the bad, outside of the art there is a clear lack of attention to detail, Lil'Neds base is too large so you can't fit the player rings around it. Monster cards don't have model numbers on them. Cards from the factory have quality issues (they are replacing those affected), and frankly, for a game called Massive Darkness, the game is too easy, Lil'Ned as a Battle Wizard is an example of an extremely broken combo that even at level 2 can demolish most Greater Monsters with little difficulty. The game itself hasn't been thought through to give a challenging and rewarding experience.

Plays so far: 3

Beautiful minis and boards. As with Sword and Sorcery, the level of challenge gets lower as your characters get stronger until the point where you can play it in autopilot. The best way I have found to keep it challenging is by playing in story mode but dropping all collected objects between scenarios and going back to original equipment. I am thinking about also removing the even cards with beneficial effects.

It takes time to understand all the different rules and abilities and the interactions between them but once you do, it is a really fun game. Actually, the best way to understand them is to actually play it. It has lots of replayability. I played it with my 9-year-old girl and she did great. She enjoyed it a lot too and liked the minis a ton. The mechanics are sound and you feel the tension when there could be enemies lurking at any corner. We are looking forward to play this again.

Once we figure out how to tweak the difficulty properly the rating is sure to rise at least a point. In all, however, this is REALLY fun to play. It's fast paced and makes you feel powerful. You're constantly progressing and getting gear, which makes it feel more like a rogue-like simulator rather than a true dungeon crawl.

I played a lot of dungeon crawlers, but I like this one the best. 

I really enjoy playing this game. it feels like a pure dungeon crawler. you are actually crawling through dark dungeons while slaying hordes of enemies. awesome.

there are so many variations of this genre on the market, but none really hit the spot for me. most of the "one vs many"-versions feel very imbalanced, which is highly frustrating. also someone has to play the evil guy all alone, while his friends team up against him, which is certainly not for everyone. most co-op-versions are extremely dull and get boring very fast. others try to emulate a pen and paper RPG. either they fail miserably in that attempt or the game becomes way too complex for what it actually has to offer at its core. 

bottom line for me personally is, that dungeon crawlers are inherently a simple genre. it allows adults to play with little toys, which is fine (I do it myself). therefore it has to be fun and entertaining foremost, like a good super hero movie. and Massive Darkness does this perfectly in my opinion. if I want a complex strategy game, I will play an area control game like twilight imperium or something else like blood rage. If I want to engage into an immersive and vast world, I will play a pen and paper RPG. Massive Darkness offers you a fast-paced action adventure, which will most likely appeal to many gamers and non-gamers out there.

RATING: 4
Someone needed to reign in the designers, there's too many card decks/tokens/identical minis etc. The "mob" enemies don't need to be an actual mob, they basically serve as armor anyway. 

Combat is dice rolls, which would be fine if they balanced dice rolls with some form of RvR, but they didn't. The idea of adding item card stats to enemies is nice, I'll give them that  - but even then, armor cards on enemies is rough at low levels.

Strategy is almost non-existent (think Zombicide). Setup/packup is horrendous because the devs couldn't control themselves.

Game length for the larger quests is 4+ hours, which again, would be fine if there was some strategy and interesting combat.

I don't think I've regretted a KS more than this one, and I backed Dark Souls.

Some house rule changes to increase the overall difficulty but a great game. I am glad that I purchased all the additional content to increase the enemies, heroes and roaming monsters as it adds much more options to the game. Only major negative so far is how CMON skimped on their customers with low quality boxes for the KS items and some add-ons. It will be extremely difficult to store/organize and setup/breakdown games even with after market box inserts additional "side boxes" will be needed to try and address this. They should have made a real box for Light Bringer pledges or followed suit with Sword & Sorcery's concept of a special box for KS backers that holds all the extras. 

Easy way to make more challenging without taking away from the game or adding a bunch of rules is to nerf the treasures. Either reduce the amount for door cards or treat the treasure tokens as currency and if you want a level 3 treasure you have to trade in 3 treasure tokens to get it.

RATING: 7.2
Needed to build an insert as sleeved cards and the tokens won’t fit inside the box (what thoughts had CMON where to put the punched out tokens?)
even with insert and organized cards long set up time (15min)
box for monsters: roaming monsters can fall down if not withdrawn on table

best part is character progression and how you equip them
(with 2 or 3 players you will be flooded with equipment; so we canceled transmute during quest and shifted it to townphase)
with dice roll and depending on treasure boss/agent/roaming monster gets equipped with game gets deadly very fast
if the equipment can’t be used by the enemy it usually stays easy

The heroes get too powerful at about level 4 skills so that even roaming monsters get killed before counter attack or activation. With giving them more health (approved test with player count + level instead of only player count) it gets better as the heroes have to watch out. With Quests at Level 5 usually the heroes and the enemies have 3Y3R attack. So very luck dependent if you don't have acquired good defense skills as well. 

Over all as I expected 20% for the gameplay (fun easy rolling dice with some strategy/tactical elements on some of the quests)  and 80% to have (great) miniatures to paint and be used with pathfinder.

EDIT from 6 to 7.2 after playing some one-shots with 3 heros; game is far better in this mode than story mode. More tense and harder (especially with KS roaming monsters) and more thinking needed what actions to do with your heros (at least till level 3).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Too long for what it is, too easy to win. Mechanism to scale with player count flawed by design (mobs are more likely to be killed by 1 player, the fewer players there are => less players, less enemy attacks)

A pretty simple, but fun, dungeon romp. You get a lot of exp and treasure making it entertaining to kick back with friends and spend an evening slaying your way through a dungeon.  

I think this is a notch above Zombicide Black Plague, which I also enjoy playing. The class/profession combos when combined with the dungeon levels and loot make character progression more meaningful. 

Scaling encounters are great. You can play the game with one to six players with each player only controlling 1 character. This is a huge improvement when compared to Zombicide games which require players to control multiple characters if you don't have max player count. 

Bad: 
There is a lot of randomness to this game making it extremely unbalanced. At times it is too easy and other times the party just gets crushed. The difficulty is dependent on the draw of the monster, draw of the items, draw of the event, dice rolls, etc. without many options to even out the luck both for or against the players. 

Blue/green dice and symbols weren't very colorblind friendly for one of our players. 

You will want to get the extras, there isn't enough creature or character variety to keep things fresh over an extended period of time.

Another subpar cmon minis game. Byfar the shallowest dungeon crawler ive ever played.

In many ways this is a modern evolution of classic, high fantasy, dungeon crawl games like Hero Quest, with a shot of Zombicide thrown in for good measure. A nice improvement is the ability to tailor your character to your tastes by combining different classes with different Heroes. And the titular Darkness mechanic adds an element of strategy that keeps the game interesting and strategic. Keeping up the trend with CMON games, the art design and miniatures are both top notch.

I have now played it a couple of times. This game is easy to teach. With just a few rules it allows tactical and with the campaign setting strategical game play. The AI of the monsters works wonderful and creates a game that is worthwhile to be remembered and to be told of. It is family friendly and engaging. It tells a story and brings fun to the gaming table. And the components are beautiful. That is a must for me. I will never part from this game. Highly recommended to all lovers of games and Fantasy.

Another CMON hit.  This is the 'next evolution' of the Zombicide game engine.  Challenging, and very thematic.  Definitely not a pushover game, and only a tad bit too fiddly.

One thing.  Once the tokens are punched out (and bagged), they absolutely won't fit in the box again.  This game begs for a storage solution.

Pretty standard Ameritrashy dungeon crawl:

Minis.
Use movement points.  
Roll the dice to attack monsters.  
Level up with acquired treasure.  
Constant accounting - "My character sheet gives me +1 wound and +1 sword point, and my cloak allows me to use my Darkness bonus.  My weapons allow me to roll 2 red dice against the creature's 2 green and 1 blue dice."  

Blah blah blah.  I'm sure this game is solid if you like this kind of thing, but REALLY, I just don't find this kind of game interesting.

Zombicide in the darkness : it's a light dungeon crawling game.

Difficulty range from "die facing the first encounter" to "easily take over everything the evil-hiding-in-the-dark try to throw in the face of heroes".

If you're stuck facing a strong foe with matching defensive item on the first event card, you'll have a high chance to wype as you'll hardly scratch him.
Once you've reach a point in the game (having good stuff and usefull skills), you've high chance to just one turn kill almost every ennemies.

Won't recommend the game for all players, but it's a hit right now in my friend group. New game effect and we're all enjoying the zombicide game serie, so...

As a skirmish game I think Massive Darkness is great. You can go from zero to hero in about 2 hours. As a campaign game it's poor. There's no connecting story and the game doesn't do a good job leveling with the characters. The challenge ultimately diminishes to nothing.

Great dungeon crawler that hits all the cravings of a miniatures game without the overly long and complicated ruleset. The basics of the game are exactly what they appear: go through a dungeon, kill the mobs, get loot, power up. The characters and the classes allow for some interesting mixing and matching. Rounds flow pretty smoothly, with very minimal interruptions or moments of confusion in regards to who is doing what. The AI system for the enemies can be a bit easy to game, but I personally would rather a have an easier AI to understand/explain to newer players than an overly complex one. 

The only downfall in the game seems to come from the power curve. Starting the game in Level 1, things can be a little hard and you really have to rely on teamwork and strategy to take out mobs and roaming monsters. However, once your team hits level 3 and you start unlocking your skills and finding equipment that maxes out your dice rolls, it becomes a bit too easy. Late game combat also becomes a bit of a chore as there isn't really a good way to track all of the equipment and skill cumulative bonuses. 

As is, the game is great for casual board gamers who would thrill of taking a lowly adventurer and turning them into a force of nature. For those who are seeking a more challenging game that requires grinding and careful strategy, don't fret. With some very minor house rules you can easily make this game what you crave. What's more, the game is ripe for owners to create custom scenarios. All of this combines for a product that I highly recommend for players of all types.

My first impression of it (playing the tutorial, solo) was horrible. It felt like a really easy game with no real need of thinking, since the character was so overpowered, that simply rolling the dice would kill all enemies.

And then I tried playing it 2 and 4 heroes. The 2 heroes trial, gave me the same feel of something missing. But, then we tried the 4 heroes one, enemies suddently felt stronger (simply because there were more of them, or they had more health) decisions had to be made to keep the group alive (we died two times, once more and it would have been over) and after a 4 long hours of game, i got to enjoy it a lot.

So right now, pending the story mode version in which you continue with your character development from one scenario to the next one, my feeling of the game is "That's a good Dungeon crawler game i would not have any  problem playing it again".

Glad i took this 4 heroes game. Nevertheless, i think i won't be playing a 1 or 2 heroes game anymore D:

This really does feel like a fantasy dungeon crawl version of Zombicide. There are some noticeable differences though. One is that there are now dice for attack and defense, which I'm not really a fan of. It isn't as obnoxious as in, say, Descent, but it's there. On the flip side, I like that you can transmute items into something new so that you aren't just carrying around a bunch of junk. I also like how this scales better than Zombicide, and the class system is interesting. The campaign feels pretty tacked-on, but it's there.

So how does this stack up to Zombicide for me - specifically, Black Plague? Well, I like Black Plague better, though I recognize that this is the next evolution of the system. I just prefer the simplicity of  Zombicide's design, and you could easily add in most of the campaign rules and transmute action if you wanted to. Massive Darkness does have the light and dark mechanic, which I really like, but if I'm going to invest in one, Black Plague is what I prefer. I just don't like that you must use 6 characters in BP, but otherwise I enjoy it more.

I own the KS edition with almost all expansions. Miniatures are great and that's unfortunately about the only positive thing I can come up with. The gameplay is very VERY light.

After the tutorial, our group thought the game had potential.  After the first scenario (6 hours later), not so much.

The first 2 levels were pretty fun, challenging and tense.  Once our heroes got to level 3, there wasn't a tense moment the rest of the game.  You kill monsters and they don't threaten you.  You keep leveling up and it only gets worse.  We had 6 heroes; if we had 3 they would have transmuted treasure way too quickly and become OP even sooner.

Yes, it took 6 hours to move through the hordes, but no fun was happening.  As we neared the end, we realized there is a huge piece missing...there is no boss, or end of scenario challenge.  The "end" is just like the rest of the scenario, except that you "exit" the map.  It's over.

The time commitment is not worth the experience.  There are too many other dungeon crawls with better everything (the "darkness" mechanic is not that special).

We thought of a host of ways the game could be better:

- Agents move away from group, instead of toward.
- Leveling of guards and agents needs to increase greatly.
- Too many treasures are either OP or useless.  Not scaled  well.
- Way too many treasure tiles.
- There should be a "timing" mechanic that forces you to move through the dungeon.
- There should be penalties allowing too many monsters to accumulate.
- Transmuting and other abilities should cost an action point.

We thought about making some house rules.  The problem is nothing is scaled well.  Where would we start?  Games are so long that play-testing every aspect of the game would take a huge time commitment.  No thanks.  The designer should have done that.

After the game, I packed it up and said, "Ebay."  Everyone agreed.

This game really feels like some "Boardgame D&D": Contrarily to Conan, where one player is "the bad guy", all players are up against the game system.

This is a fun game to spend a nice evening with, but some might prefer Conan, with a human, more challenging opponent...

I've spent a lot of time "fixing" Zombicide and I'm not sure if I need another "sandbox" game where the only time we play it is when we're testing out another house rule. The minis are fantastic and I'm tempted to keep the game just so I can play Zombicide without zombies (I hate zombies so much). But I'd also like to get the space back on my shelves. Putting the game up for trade and (when I get around to it) for sale.

Incidentally, Space Cadets: Away Missions is the game you want to be playing. It manages to keep the tension from start to finish.

[q="zinho73"]It seems like a game that stopped development when it was good enough.[/q]

Yeah. It stopped development in 1989 when HeroQuest was made! :laugh:

The "shields and swords" mechanic's been used since HeroQuest, in games like HeroQuest, Battle Masters, HeroScape, Magic: The Arena, etc. FFG introduced the "surge" mechanic with Descent back in 2009. These aren't necessarily the first use of these mechanics, but should give an idea of how *old* they are. Dungeoncrawling, Levels, XP, etc. can be traced back to *1977* with Dungeons and Dragons. 

Shadow mode, mobs, transmutation, and roaming monsters *are* uncommon mechanics, but they sorta fell flat in the final rules. I think the consensus is that after the KS ended, shadow mode and mobs were further developed to be more streamlined, but not more interesting play. Roaming monsters made the game worse, by introducing random swinginess. Transmutation makes the game too easy once players start acquiring treasure. 

What HeroQuest et al. didn't have was bookkeeping, and MD fell into the trap of adding complexity without adding gameplay. Heck, HQ had *spell cards* which MD and Descent don't. I've also yet to find the "diminishing returns" search mechanic HQ uses (you draw from a deck, removing the treasures from it, but returning to it the traps!). It really is too bad that HQ isn't on the market, because it's a far less bookeeping game than MD is, yet just as much fun (or more!). HQ pretty much blows away MD for the kids and casuals.

I finally played Myth yesterday, and *wow* its card focus brings a lot to the dungeoncrawl genre. It's ridiculously complicated, but I highly recommend it for dungeoncrawl gamers who don't mind a game that evolved in left field.

Massive Darkness is an underwhelming game due to the built in randomness, the rules and figure statistics. A great dungeon crawl has a well balanced story with plot twists. Since the game was a kickstarter, there are add-ons and exclusive figures. A set of stories could not be written that is made for the add-ons since many would find that extra expense prohibitive. The story could not be written just for the core game since that would exclude the add-ons and few would buy them.  For those buying the game at retail, the stories can't have KS exclusive figures. So CMON made a game that randomly introduces figures, some of which in a well written story would be reserved for climactic conclusions.
The rules have some unnecessary complications. To gradually challenge to players, there are levels on the playing surface which are truly confusing. That aspect activates enemy figures from 5 levels of difficulty. The difference between each level is so minimal as to make it pointless. The hero players level up so much each game that they are un-phased by the most threatening foe.
The worst aspect of Massive Darkness is the statistics for the monsters and heroes. The monster stats have no relation to the size and threat of each figure. There are too many small figures with better dice combinations than the largest and scariest figures. The problem with the hero statistics is that they have none. A wizard can out barbarian a barbarian with the acquisition of heavy arms and armor.
The good part of Massive Darkness are the monster figures. The large ones are well detailed and look awesome. Yet the best ones are KS exclusives, so buying the retail game would feel like an insult. The small ones are above average but not much to excited about. The artists seem to have taken some shortcuts with too many monsters wearing skirts. I'd mention the lack of a dragon but that is another story.

Pretty boring with limited to no decisions. We simply walked through the dungeon, room by room, killing things. No tension, no strategy, just repetitive monsters. Minis are cool to look at, but that doesn't justify the cost of the game.

KS all-in (except for Z:BP bits, as i don't have Z:BP). i'd give it an 8 or 9 if it moved as smoothly as classic Zombicide (as opposed to Black Plague, with which i have no experience). As it is, mid- to late game (levels 3+), it seems that 50-75% of the play time is spent checking for skill effects from the class skill sheets (this time increases as the levels progress to 4 and 5). Balance/difficulty is very swingy, depending (apparently) largely on how many Roaming Monsters the Event Deck throws at you in levels 1-2. After level 3, the only challenge the game can really throw at you is an aggressive scenario-specific timer.

Ended up selling mine because "meh".

Only 2 plays. This is fun for what it is, a loads of dudes on map with dice and cool miniatures game. You have some tactical choices but nothing too brain shattering. I enjoyed both sessions and I'd be happy to play again but I wouldn't seek it out. More plays might up the grade a bit or lower it a bit but I can't see it going below 6 or above 7, hence the 6.5.  Definitely prefer it to Zombicide.

Bought in my Kickstarter rush days. Not a bad game per se but inconsistent with very poor balancing. Too hard at level one, ridiculously easy past level 3. I swear there's a truly great game here with a good heavy revision; hence why I'm keeping hold. After Massive Darkness 2, all these extra kickstarter goodies will be worth their weight.

This is a fantasy adventure game with lots of miniatures.  Pretty much Descent but with programming-controlled enemies instead of the need for an overlord.

You set up a scenario using the tiles and rules described in the book for the chosen quest.  Then players select a hero and a hero class.  Each hero has a recommended class but you can mix and match to your heart's content which is nice for variability.  On a player's turn they take two actions which can be anything from moving to attacking to transmuting items into higher quality items.  The main ways that enemies make it into the games (besides being a part of setup) is through door cards or event cards.  Door cards are drawn whenever a closed door is opened and place treasure and enemies on the board.  Events are drawn each round and can be good or bad and are usually the method the hardest enemies (roaming monsters) make it into the game.

First of all, the game looks amazing, at least in terms of miniatures.  I'm not the biggest fan of the art.  And for what I paid on Kickstarter the amount that I got is completely worth it.  The rulebook seemed well-written as well which lately seems to be a rarity unfortunately.

Of course I would expect the rulebook to not be such an issue because the game is reasonably simple.  There're very few unique powers or abilities so most of the game consists of moving around and rolling different amounts of dice for combat.  And this game really does seem to be all about the combat.  Which is nice because sometimes that's what you're after and sets it apart a little bit from other fantasy adventure games that might focus more on narrative, puzzles, and tactics.  Not that that isn't here, just with a larger side of bashing bad guys.

The biggest criticism I've seen is that this game is too easy.  I didn't feel that way, granted I only played the tutorial quest (which was super simple) and the spider quest but that one we won on the very last possible turn before defeat.  And it was a hard-earned win.  I will say I think the campaign rules seem kind of pointless.  They just slow down progression so that you level up slowly over time but start from a higher starting point in subsequent adventures.  I wouldn't bother but that's just fine because nowadays I don't really have time to play campaigns, I'd rather have a one session adventure.

I think my own major piece of criticism is that the game is very simple and when it comes to fantasy adventure games with character classes and abilities and powers and a varied stack of weapon cards and different enemies I want a little complication.  I like lots of rules and variability.  But as of yet I haven't been disappointed with what is here.

The long wait was worth it! I only had time for a few sessions, but my group wants to play more and we really enjoyed playing this game as one off quests. Perhaps I'll enjoy it for much longer time then those who bought just the base game (I received the KS extras and purchased all expansion packs with figures)

If you do buy the game, remember that it is not built to be a well thought out "Gloomhaven" rich campaign. It is however, a dungeon crawl that you can slay lots of monsters, get fun loot, and feel like a powerful adventurer at the end of your 1-2+ hours of play. I'm planning to post a more in depth review, but for now I'm gonna keep playing :)

Too early to rate (outside of components).  What I don't get is the low ratings of 2,3,4's or even the really high 10's.  The game is fun, not too difficult, could use some improvements as most have suggested.  Depending upon one's perspective or expectation it probably is somewhere between a 9.0 & 6.0.  Honestly, the miniatures alone are probably worth at least $100 (Kickstarter edition).  The group that wanted it for Story/Campaign mode will be the most disappointed.  However, if you want to pull it out for 2-3 hours of single quests, it's pretty darn good and will have a ton of fan made quests shortly to extend replay value.  I debated for the last several weeks if I should keep or open it based upon all the varying commentary...I'm very happy I kept it in my collection thus far.

EDIT:  Enough into now to comfortably give it a 7.8 rating.  I do not play Story Mode and only transmute after quests and only allow weapons/treasures to be carried by bad guys if they can use it, otherwise no treasure drop when defeated.  Also looking at Opponent's opportunity attacks when Heroes roll blanks.

Could have been better organized and a little deeper...but still enjoyable and pretty much what I expected.

Edit 10/2/17:  A few tweaks and wow much tighter, more difficulty.  For now an 8.2 and could probably go a little higher.

Edit 10/22/17:  I'm leaving at a 8.2 rating.  If you are looking for a dungeon crawl with great miniatures and want to appeal to the widest audience, and can pull it out anytime without an hour of prep or rules review... this IS it!

RATING: 6
simplified dungeon crawler game with nice miniatures

+ has some nice ideas (shadow mode, simplified battle system with custom dice, monsters modified by equipment, modular board, fast level up, ...)
+ quality miniatures
- a bit oversimplified in some parts, could be made better
- game balance issues: characters seem unbalanced, items quite weak, big monsters a bit too strong
- doesn't play that well ?
-- extremely expensive

I played it once so far, it didn't play that well, maybe we played some things wrong, I don't know. We had one character way overpowered (Sibyl?) and the others not able to do much against bigger/tougher monsters. My character still had mostly its starting equipment through to the end of the quest. We had two Noble Warriors giving action points to the one stronger character to do all the work, and frankly we wouldn't have made it without that. -> Not a good game experience!

I don't like the rolling attack and defense dice at once.
Strict turn order seems hindering.

I think dungeon crawlers are in general better as computer games.

How do I explain to my game group that Monsters in mobs attack only with one dice throw, whatever number of monster in that mob?? bad

Capture the essence of Diablo 2 dungeon crawling hack and slash game. Love it. Always hoped to have a board game like this. So much dungeon crawling game fail at delivering a tense and satisfying gameplay. 

House rule added : Heroes can move out of enemies zone, but suffer one attack from the monsters in that zone with no possibility to retaliate for that action.

Having to add house rules to a game cost the game losts of points.

For those winning that game is too easy add this HOUSE RULE :
EVERY MONSTER IN MOBS ATTACK ON ITS OWN, WITHOUT THE ITEM CARRIED BY THE BOSS (boss still attack also)

Also, lots of monsters in tha box is good, but is turn out bad if half those monsters are similar ( ex : archer goblin & warrrior goblin, 2 type of dwarf mob, 2 type of orc mobs)
Could have been a much better game and convenient box if they would have spare the expansions and include ratlings and reptisaurians already in tha box instead of too much goblin/orc/dwarf

I love CMON, but I hate how these important design details were not implemented.

RATING: 5
Not too impressed so far. It really suffers in comparison to Zombicide Black Plague, in that it increases the complexity without adding a lot of tactical depth. Not many interesting decisions. Hopefully someone will come up with some rules to turn this top quality box of toys into a game.

It's probably not worth buying the retail edition, it seems really bad value compared to the kickstarter boxes.

Cooperative dungeon crawler with amazing miniatures. Includes a campaign feature for multiple sessions. Difficulty balancing may need some tweaking via house rules to suit your desire for challenge, and the various guard units don't feel as diverse as they could (though Roaming Monsters are unique terrors on the battlefield). A great way to spend a few hours.

RATING: 7.5
Initial thoughts after tutorial and one mission, core box only, normal mode, 2 players.

An incredibly entertaining, if entirely brainless, dice chucker. Strongly reminds me of the hack and slash loot-fest of the Diablo video games. There are even armour sets!

Plenty of flaws. There is almost no story. It has a weird difficulty curve which starts out quite tough and very quickly becomes easy to the point of trivial. It's long (ish) and has a fair bit of book keeping which could get stodgy with more players. With 2 players, a full mission took a good couple of hours. Could see this getting quicker with experience but still a bit long for how light it is.

Despite all that, it really is great fun.  I never got bored of charging into mobs of goblins with my barbarian, cleaving through the minions before (literally) headbutting the boss to death. The characters and classes feel fun and varied. Your heroes quickly turn into wrecking balls, dripping in fancy loot. While it makes the difficulty pretty laughable, it's still hilarious fun and it'd be easy to house rule to make things more challenging.

I had a blast and can't wait to play again, encounter new monsters, try new characters. 

If a challenging and cerebral coop experience is what you're after, this is probably not for you. If you feel like spectacularly splatterating a shit load of goblins and then stealing their fancy trousers, this is the game!

Lastly, couldn't talk about a CMON game without mentioning components which are superb. Miniatures are very good quality, sculpts and art style are characterful and a little cartoony (which fits the game perfectly). You get a generous amount of stuff, even with just the core box. Great value for any miniature painters and I will certainly be making a lot of use of them in our D&D campaigns.

Edit: After some more plays, I do think the play time is an issue. The larger maps take a very long time to play. Could make it difficult to get to the table. Fun factor is still high for me. Knocking half a point off my score due to excessive game length.

I have written many emails to CMON and started the procedure on their web site. I have received only one email after long time of spamming in which Suzy told me to wait because the Package had to return to their Hub. Since then it's passed almost a month without any reply.

Light to medium-weight dungeon crawl. Simple and with a few extras has good variability. I have the kickstarter edition with add-ons.

We've played it a few times and the simplicity of the game is what is so endearing. It's not a brain-burner and sometimes, that's all I want when playing with minis.

Based on the Kickstarter campaign, looked not so special - dungeon crawl and cool minis. But, it has no line of sight idiocies Descent alike and it has real enemy and hero progression levels. Those two are key points I always found lacking in crawlers. Plus acceptable hero skills system, and darkness rule to spice things a bit. No overlord player - for personal preference whether good that is or bad. Kickstarter version has a lot of extra content, worthy buy.

If your looking for a fun yet not too complex adventure/dungeon crawl style game...then this might fit that itch. The stand alone, normal rules makes for enjoyable game sessions (only done up to 4 people atm). Playing it with two people was fun too. Plus, the game looks great. Overall, would recommend for those groups (or evenings) that you want to play something fun yet will not take too long (compared to more in depth RPG style games) and not overload your session with rules tracking. I have not heard/read too much good with story mode/campaign, but have not been tempted to try it cause the regular mode is pretty fun.

Had a lot of fun playing this one although I can say that the fun does wane after 3 or 4 plays. The quests that come with the game are all very similar and have you basically doing the same things over and over. The sheer amount of loot you can collect is really cool but if you have a full party of 6 playing there will be people left behind as by the time you complete the quests you will not have everyone nearly geared up. Better with fewer people playing.

It is _not_ Zombicide! And that's fine. I was really hopeful for this concept. I think it falls a bit short. For as much as a single turn turn can swing a game of Z:BP this game feels even worse. Specifically, in certain scenarios if you don't get decent loot in the beginning it can be difficult to move forward without expending all of your lives. 

ORRRRR you become god-like and there's no challenge.

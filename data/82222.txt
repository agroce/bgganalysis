[I]tl;dr - Get ready for hours to tick by unnoticed as you explore space and succeed in a tough galaxy. Xia is the maxi big brother to the tiny [thing=36659][/thing].[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Wow. What an ambitious and sprawling game. In Xia: Legends of a Drift System, you are a space captain in charge of your own little space ship. As you fly around, you will deliver goods, collect bounties, and upgrade your ship with newer components. This is the boardgame version of Dope Wars or one of those classic PC/Palm Pilot space trading games. 

I love this game because it's less of a competition and more of a sandbox. You're just flying around, enjoying the galaxy, and building your own ship. This thing takes three hours to play and the time just flies by. It's not good if you're looking for a highly structured, competitive game, but it's absolutely great if you've got a free afternoon and want to hang out with some gaming buddies. 

Even better, the designer (Cody Miller) has made production-quality components available for PNP, for customizing, and has repeatedly said he's open to gameplay tweaks. You are [I]encouraged[/I] to mod the game and add house rules, because at the core, this is a sandbox. I was also encouraged to see that the latest expansion already incorporates a lot of feedback that players had during play (most notably, the broken trade route glitch which, I feel, was gamebreaking).

Though I don't own this game (and probably don't know enough people who would play it to ever own it myself), Xia is still a fantastic game that's well worth your time. I haven't found many games that do such a great job of discovery, exploration, and plain all-around spacefaring fun.

RATING: 8
Great components and production values.  Great sandbox style options of choices to make during a game.  Only real complaint is that the randomness of layout and rolls can skew too far in one direction and slow things down too much.

RATING: 8
What I really like is the feeling of being a privateer in space, someone between a merchant, explorer and a pirate. It captures the space adventure really well.

The little moments where you decide if you take the safe route or try to navigate a debris field (with 15% chance of your ship exploding), or randomly wander into the local star (and explode) because you jumped into an unexplored sector blind, just to save one of your resources.

Board and ship quality is really nice as well. I don't think I have played a game with better designed coins (I think I might fool someone that it is a real currency :-)

Even though I like the game in general, I found three downsides that makes me play less often: 

* It can take decent amount of time to get going  (maybe it is the problem of my game-group, but first few rounds are usually spent just on relatively chance based mining/buying/selling before someone has enough money to buy a better ship/equipement to make i.e. more fun pirate career feasible)

* The combat is really chance based and destroying an enemy ship completely can take several turns.

* It needs 3 players at least, and usually takes at least 30 mins/player (add 15 mins if you need to explain rules)

I would still suggest playing it most of the time I have the oportunity, just to relive the "Go ahead, fly through the asteroid field, you'll be fine" nagging of fellow players :-)

RATING: 5
La idea "general" del juego es muy buena, pero el resultado está a mitad camino. Le ha faltado mucho trabajo más detras en las reglas. Hay muchos detalles que revisándolos, el juego ganaría muchísimo. (Y mucha gente en los foros sugiere muchas ideas, que bien se podrían haber implementado). Y ojo, no me refiero a hacerlo más "euro", eso es cuestión de gustos. Me refiero a jugar mejor con las probabilidades de los dados, y que no se convierta en un tira dados me lo juego todo al azar lineal, sin importar modificaciones de la nave. Por ejemplo, veo absurdo aumentar los equipos y que sigas pudiendo sacar un 1. Para moverte, para atacar para defenderte... Y luego tampoco importa tanta variedad de nave o mejoras, si tienes la misma posibilidad de morir-atraversar campo de asteroides o recolectar. Todo esto le quita toda la importacia a la personalización que se busca de la nave, propia de un sandbox, que es lo que se pretende digo yo...
Hay que hacer mecánicas elegantes y sencillas, pero de tanto simplificar han metido la pata, parece un juego de los 70-80 sin testear en el tema numérico.
Hay muchos más detalles que se han tenido que "arreglar" como el "bucle de comercio" entre dos planetas cercanos en que puedas comprar-vender rápidamente. 
Tiene de bueno la libertad de decidir que "rol" tomar con tu nave, pero si lo enfocas a cómo ganar, se sigue viendo que hay claras preferencias por el comercio... y resulta fustrante otras estrategias. Demasiados esfuerzos hay que hacer para conseguir tumbar otra nave, que no suele compesar, una pena! Ni si quiera con la genial idea de aumentar la recompensa de la misma.

Los componentes sí, son una pasada, sobretodo las naves y las monedas! De ahí que también se vea reflejado en un precio escandaloso...

En fin es una lástima que lo que podría haber sido un gran ameritrash, con vistas de sandbox, sea tan tan azaroso y poco balanceado, además de prentender ser personalizable y ésto sea sólo una ilusión que no se refleja en el juego.  Igual de aquí un tiempo con muchas modificaciones (ya hay bastantes muy buenas) hechas por la comunidad mejore bastante.

I played a basic game and only up to 5 and it's really really good. It can take a bit of time, but it's not so noticeable as turns are quick and you can watch stuff happen to their ships. There are a fair amount of rules but they are easy to pick up. I need to get more plays of this though.

RATING: 7
Xia is definitely a fun game, but it's real greatness much depends on your group. New players are exited during the first part of the game due to exploring and bunch of things to do. But! Drift System is much-much more interesting against group of experienced players: handicapping against a player at the first place to make his life difficult as hell, at the same time preparing yourself to be the first against them all. It's amazing!

On the other hand, if everyone concentrates only on his strategy, without coop and handicap, Xia becomes very luck based game with almost no interactions between players, huge downtime and unstoppable merchant as leader.

Most issues are because of nearly useless 1 on 1 combat and overpowered merchant strategy (during sessions when buy-sell planets appear close enough). Just play a few times before adding homerule for it.

RATING: 10
Xia is quite possibly one of the best games I've ever played. With a true sandbox experience, vibrant parts, high quality components and intense replay value, there's never not a time that we want to play Xia. For a week solid, it hit the table every night and continues to do so on a regular basis. The game has a few knacks, such as Smuggler missions being worse than Shuttle and the Shield units being utterly broken (house rules!). However, the rest of the game truly feels like a space-operatic sandbox adventure role playing game. The use of polyhedral dice is a nice touch to adding that tabletop RP feel. The ships are quirky, the locations are interesting and despite only having 21 tiles to explore, its replay value has not diminished. It has metal coins, more bags than you'll have components, beautiful painted ship minis, a pull out tray for all the game pieces, acrylic damage marker crystals, and one hell of a mission deck. Each ship having different powers just adds to the ever-growing list of reasons why no one should pass up this game. But wait, there's more. The modding community is active and officially encouraged due to the existence of a dev kit, so the replayability of your game will never diminish.

RATING: 6
Fun sandbox game with many options. Plays a bit like Eclipse crossed with Galaxy Trucker. One problem is the lengthy time between turns - going around the table, each player's turn can take 5-10 minutes, and often there is little interaction. You can fight each other, but otherwise it's often multiplayer solitaire. Would not mind playing again, but didn't grab me enough to buy it.

Wow. This game is excellent. I have a few nitpicks, but this game really surpasses them. My first play has stuck with me and I want desperately to play again. The stories this game tells - the time I blind jumped directly into the Sun, how Paul became a notorious outlaw simply because he was too lazy to find the entrance to planets, the time I tried to blaster another player and then had to run away in fear... It's amazing. So good. 

Nitpicks: Game is long; wouldn't want to play with AP players. Exploration tokens aren't that exciting - I want more variety (like in Eclipse). Would love for combat to be spiffed up a bit.

A superb open-world space exploration game.  There are several ways to gain the Fame Points needed to win and you can customise your ship to best suit which way you want to play.

There have been a few issues noted (mainly the trading mechanic can be used to get a quick win) but there are some great fan made varients on BGG and the upcoming expansion will fix a lot of these complaints.

The base game can be played solo reasonably well as a more relaxing exploration game, but, again, the new expansion will have solid rules for involved solo play.

This is the space game I've been looking for.

This is like Escape Velocity: The Board Game, with a crap-ton of swingy dice rolls added to it. The variance and luck is acceptable in a space comedy sort of way. I do enjoy how the game is 100% sandbox--there are barely even prescriptions on how to best accrue fame... just get out there and do it. The evolving solar system exploration is satisfying... almost as satisfying as watching your opponents blind-jumping into the sun.

With more plays, I could see this being rated higher. It could be renamed "Cross Your Fingers: The Board Game". That is neither good nor bad, just the facts.

EDIT: After additional plays, I've warmed to this game quite a bit. It's more or less archetypal Ameritrash--narrative/drama generation laced with strategy. The more everyone is familiar with it, the longer we can go in terms of fame, which does vastly improve the hilarity and arc of what takes place.

Super fun space exploration game. Will likely retire Merchants and Marauders for me. I generally do not like super luck heavy old school games, but it works for me here. I like that you never know whats around the bend. I just wish my wife could stop having such insane dice luck.

RATING: 3
Really, really  wanted to like this game, because I like the theme and pick-up-and-deliver aspect. We play Merchants and Mauraders, Black Fleet, and Merchant of Venus, so were excited to play Xia. We played 3 games with 4-5 players. The components are great...all the ships are beautiful with some cool ideas for abilities. We also liked the idea of the modular slots to customize your ship.  However, it is a complete luck fest with dice rolling for virtually everything. Attack strategies are useless as shields are too powerful, missions are not feasible much of the time and may go directly against what you are trying to do, ship abilities seem unbalanced, and ship upgrades can easily lead to king making. In the end, we decided that the number of house rules required to fix the many issues with Xia wasn't worth it. This is really more of an experience, or a DIY design kit than an actual game. Another half baked Kickstarter that had such promise. Components well done. Game play completely raw. Such a shame!

Kickstarted Sellsword level. Sold.

RATING: 5
I used to have the game on my wishlist. I removed it after the first play. TLDR, the game is well produced but awfully designed. Buy Merchants and Marauders instead. Avoid this.

-The good stuff-
*The game is beautiful. That's about all the positives it has. Metal coins. Prepainted ships in stands. Nice artwork. 
*The tile placement for mods is a nice idea but unfortunately makes no sense in the game context. 

-The bad stuff-
* Combat doesn't work. Simple as that. It needs a major overhaul of the system to somehow work.  
* Rolling to move could be better if there were a way to mitigate bad rolls. Also there should be a better way to scale everything instead of just upgrading the die. 
* Variance in the game is just too much to make any meaningful decision. When you mine its possible to take 1-9(!!!!) damage depending on the roll. Only way to mitigate it is to have shields. 
* Missions make no sense and are not balanced. A profitable trading route is always better than missions. 
* Also has serious kingmaking, runaway leader problems and too much randomness in critical areas. 
* It's too long for what transpires. The only way to stop someone with a good trade route is to gang up on him which only prolongs the game.

It's a game that looks like it was designed in the 80's. Bad design 101. Thank the heavens i never bought this and it really justifies my aversion for anything Kickstarter. Merchants & Marauders has it's problems but it's a better game in almost every area by a wide margin.

I knew nothing of the background to this game other than I was offered the opportunity to play.  I understand the game is a Kickstarter production and several months late in arriving.  However I was very impressed by the quality of the production, the care and attention that had gone into its production and the scope of what was included.  Excellent value for money.  I approached the game open minded.  At first I thought we were in Eclipse territory, but quickly realised it was closer to Talisman.  There were plenty of clever ideas – the ‘board’ construction, the ship lay outs, the forgiving ‘action point’ energy and resources systems.  Some player interaction in the basic game but nothing nasty – i.e. get benefits for attempting to steel an opponent’s goods, but gaining the benefit for the attempt rather than actually taking the goods (which the opponent may not have any of anyway).  The missions were very hit and miss.  Draw three, keep one or zero.  But you must complete the mission before starting another and most missions at the start are likely to refer to systems not yet in play.  But then I believe you approach the missions as a tactical opportunity and not a strategy.  However there is a big choice of exploring, trading and delivering to do which was fun and absorbing to undertake.  Winning was not really important, it was a go for the ride game with a Talisman feel which I would happily play again.  There is a lot to explore here.  I wish the game well as it is such an impressive undertaking.

Xia is excellent at providing a sense of exploration. Each particular exploration also feels different enough based on the tile draws, mission cards, title cards and event cards. The various strategic paths a player can take in each session are well developed and provide lots of ways to further explore the game. There's lots of little ways in which the game injects little decision points that shape your strategy and vice versa. For example, as you buy new ships, you develop your own combination of player powers. Your prior choices may inform what ship to buy and what ship you buy may inform how you move towards the next few fame points.

From the start, I played this game with the expansion, Embers of the Forsaken Star, fully incorporated into the base game. I consider the expansion a must have. The expansion adds in a lot welcome mitigation aspects, so the game doesn't feel unduly random. If I had come to Xia prior to the expansion, I would have probably found the game too random (e.g., the unmitigated roll and move of the base game).

At higher play counts, the turn down time could be too long for some players' preferences. For my purposes, the down time will likely limit how much this gets played with groups moving forward. The multiplayer game is probably an 8, while the solo game is a 9 or above. My rating is a combination of the two.

The rule book doesn't do a good job of making the game easy to learn. However, it does a good job as a reference tool. That minor negative is the only black mark I can see in the otherwise amazing production of this game.

death is not as a problem just respawn

cons
missions are dull pick up and delivery style.
npcs are just for money they have no inner logic.
no events of the game like in merchants&maradeurs
not so much upgrades int the game{shields,guns,cargo}
price

still the game is really good it gives a formul D vibe but just in space.i would call it more of a race game than a sandbox game.but i like it and probably keep it.

I played a prototype at the Dice Tower Con at the behest of my buddies. I enjoyed it; although I thought it took too long at 5 players. Xia can best be described as a sandbox game where you are exploring your universe, performing missions and having combat with your opponents in order to gain prestige points. The first to achieve a certain amount of prestige points determined at the beginning of the game wins.

Although this is usually not my type of game, I enjoyed it nonetheless as an experience or exploration game. The interaction between the players is sufficient to hold your attention and you are in a race of sorts to be the first to complete your objectives. The components were good with some beautiful minis representing the ships and the gameplay was interesting and engaging.

This game can be fun, but it currently doesn't match my tastes as much as I thought it would at the time I backed it. I suppose over time I've discovered more of what I look for in a game and also my personal tastes have changed a bit. From an AmeriTrash perspective it feels like it could be more thematic and interactive than it is. From a Euro perspective it feels like it could be more tensely strategic and tactical than it is. Maybe it's a result of the people I game with, but we spend most of our time picking up and delivering and avoiding running into one another as we bounce from mission to mission and trading goods to planets. Overall, it's fine. I still enjoy having it. And I really did enjoy being part of the Kickstarter campaign. It was incredibly well done, with frequent updates, designer insights, input from backers, and really made the dream of the designer come to life.

Like Firefly without the theme. Which lets you make up any theme! Wish it was constructed to play better with 2, but other than that I will play this anytime.

Note: We tried using the 2 player rules modified to fly 2 ships. I think they work , but both players have to be ok with attacking each other. The penalty is reduced because you can use your other ship. A little fiddly trying to manage two outfits, but it was fun.

Randomized dice-chucking fun with bundles of theme. A nice antidote to the headier strategy (and tedious set up time) of Eclipse. Both can co-exist nicely within your game collection with little overlap. Just leave your brain at the door with this one and enjoy the beautiful cosmic ride!
	
I didn't back the Kickstarter so ended up buying an obscure Star Trek Micro Machine ship from Fleabay as a substitute for the Sellsword, which makes it fit perfectly with the other base game ships. I copied an image of my personalized ship onto the official Sellsword card, printed it up and ... Viola! My own unique Sellsword. It adds a bit of spice to have a mercenary for hire. We probably won't ever use it now I've done all that.

Absolutely love introducing my friends to this XIA. Though it may seem a bit daunting if it is your first time playing, after each player goes through a turn of their own, the game flows very easily from player to player. The freedom to make your own choices and carve your own path towards victory helps to make the game incredibly inviting to first time players. Plus the ability to MOD the game makes it fun to come back and play differently many times.

RATING: N/A
2014. AVOID. axn pt allow, dice rolling, push your luck, p/u-deliver.

AVOID. Based on snoozefest's comments, there are lots of problems/things to dislike... prices to buy and sell are fixed instead of being based on distance, the randomness (die rolls for everything including roll-and-move), 50/50 chance to get damaged instead of p/u resources, random payoffs for missions, earning VPs just for rolling a 20!, player-vs-player.

Shut Up and Sit Down's video review is perfect.  It tells me exactly why to avoid Xia (namely that it's an expensive, overproduced game built on theme and creating a story from the randomness that the game itself or other players doing mean stuff).  It can be a very mean game with players shooting you just because he's in range, and it can devolve into a negotiation and whining game of how you're no longer in the lead so attack the other guy.  It fails to provide a means to mitigate poor movement dice rolls, and it goes a step further in the wrong direction by rewarding a player with a free fame point for randomly rolling the highest number on the die (really !?!).  It's a game of collecting great riches and attacking your friends, but this is done better by Merchants & Marauders where you actually have some strategic choices.

After saying all of this, I would still like to play it (at least once) because I'm a glutton for pick-up-and-deliver and pirate-y mission games.

Tremendous replayability will keep this in heavy rotation. The amount of additional content one can add through community based modding, house rules & tweaks, flavor rules and role playing opportunities make this a boundless space sandbox. Extremely Hi-Qual components and a lot of thought and care definitely went into this game, and it really shines through!!

Update 2015 - after nearly a year without a play, broke this out for 3P on my birthday '15. I had considered selling this with the exorbitant prices it was fetching while OOP - esp. with the KS bonus… I'm really glad I held strong, this game is excellent. From low 8, to a solid 9.

Finally got around to learning and playing Xia!
I've played two games so far - once with the base game only, and the second with the Embers of a Forsaken Star expansion (all modules).
Really, pleasantly surprised by it. =] Just a solid, enjoyable experience overall. I highly recommend to sci-fi and space travel/exploration fans!
Contrasting my two plays, I agree with a lot of what people are saying about the expansion - basically essential. It adds a ton of new content but without much added complexity, as well as ways to mitigate unlucky rolls - the one major thing that bothered me during my play with the base game only.
Interestingly, this game reminds me a LOT of Runebound (Third Edition). There are definitely and obviously major differences between the two, but they both give me a similar sense of exploration that I thoroughly enjoy!
Really looking forward to some more plays. =]

Very random and can be quite brutal if events turn against you.  It's the type of game you roll to move and then roll to do stuff.  It's full of theme though and builds a solid series of memorable moments, partially through this random aspect.  Captures that child-like wonder associated with space exploration and interstellar glory.

Because of the huge reliance on the dice, you can have games were everything you do is an absolute disaster, and games where you accomplish such daring deeds that your name is laser etched into the trophy of awesome legend-ness of Xia. But as long as you have a relaxed outlook, and enjoy the story, it's ALWAYS a wonderful, daring, and hilarious epic unfolding, along the lines of Firefly or the adventurs of Han and Chewie. 

I just love this game. It's fun in a box.

Oof.  Beautiful-looking game, but it seems as though more time & resources were devoted to creating all of the bling instead of creating a game which actually works.  A brutal, tedious, time-consuming dice-driven slog through space.  The mechanics seem horribly unbalanced; unleash every weapon in your arsenal & maybe score enough hits to destroy another ship?  You get one VP.  Roll a 20 on a die?  Also one VP.  I'm not sure why anyone would try a combat-based strategy, but seriously, the idea of everyone running around picking up & delivering is just boring.  And dice rolls for every stinking thing you can imagine.  No thanks.

Very interesting game with lots going on. Hard to rate after playing just once. I liked it, but some of the rules seem vague and random. It's an interesting mix. Would certainly play more but I prefer Eclipse for space game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Xia feels like it lies somewhere between Eclipse and Firefly in terms of mechanics and gameplay.  It features Eclipse-style exploration and ship upgrade mechanics (with some Tetris thrown in) with Firefly-style jobs, cargo, and money.

Compared with Firefly, Xia has much less narrative structure, but does feel much more open.  The choice between being an outlaw smuggler or a legit trader feels like it has much more impact in Xia.  The downside is that without Firefly's story card the barrier to entry is a little more demanding.

Compared with Eclipse, Xia feels like it has far more come-from-behind potential.  If you start off poorly in Eclipse it's very difficult to come back.  But a slow start in Xia can be recovered from more easily.

Overall, Xia definitely ranks among my favourite space-themed games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A flawed, but somewhat fun addition to the sci-fi genre. The designer should have used dice similar to Formula-D. We created our own set of rules for a less luck driven game. Too bad the designer didn't play test this enough. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I really love this game, and I want to give it an 8 or a 9.  However, I personally don't think it was properly play tested.  It requires more than a few house rules to "fix".

Despite this, it's SUPER fun!  Perhaps a second edition rules or an expansion will fix the game.

UPDATE:  Even though I still feel it needs fixes, I still love this game and gave it an 8 anyway.

UPDATE:  This game is well on its way to getting a 10!  The expansion addresses all of my issues with this game.

UPDATE:  After Embers of a Foresaken Star, I finally feel comfortable giving this game a 10!  I always have a blast playing it!  This game is just hours of fun in a box, whether I am losing or winning.  Will most likely never leave my collection, and in fact I bought a back up copy of it and the expansion.

There is a lot to like about Xia, unfortunately there is also a lot to dislike. Let's dive in, shall we?

Likes:
-Modular board. A modular board can offer tons of replay in a game like this. Literally there can be a different board every time you play!
-Various win conditions. Sure you score points to win, but how you score those points, that's almost completely up to you.
-NPC's. That's right, ships that are under no players control, but can effect the game. I like that element.
-Money. The coolest tokens I've ever seen in any game to represent money. Hands down awesome. 

Dislikes:
-Dicefest. I like dice, we all do. However, it seems this game hinges on die rolls like no other. Fly into a cloud, you could lose all your fuel in one bad die roll and be stranded. Fly into a debris field, you could be killed! I get risk vs. reward, but I don't like games where 1 or 2 bad die rolls can cripple your game.
-Too many win conditions. Yes, I know I said I liked that above, however, I feel this game might take that too far. Victory point for simply rolling a 20, really?
-Shields. Shields make combat a joke.
-Combat. You literally have to arm your ship to the exclusion of all else in order to be combat effective. There is no real middle ground.
-Little player interaction. Outside of combat, which is a joke in most situations, there is little player interaction. You can be in your own corner of the galaxy doing your thing, while their off doing their's.
-Player down time. 22 minutes until my turn, with nothing relevant happening that concerns me during that time = BAD. I paid attention, because I wanted to see all that was going on. However, I could see someone, especially if they are far behind, just checking out on the game.

I liked the game, and I wouldn't say that it's flaws make it unplayable. I'd play if someone asked me to and I had some time, however, I can't see me purchasing this game unless it was at a steep discount.

What an experience. A few more tiles of full dangers (as opopsed to having just a single sun), a few more weapon types, and a variable market for goods prices (and even demand across a few different planets) would complete the game. As it stands, though... it really does fulfill admirably it's claim of being a 'sandbox game' (which was a hard expectation to live up to).

A minor niggle, though, is the box size. The game *could* have fit a standard 12-inch^2 box, rather than the oversized one it has - which I would have much preferred (for the sake a neat collection).

This space game is a ton of fun and just drips with theme.  The components are of very high quality (painted ships, metal coins) and the rule book is one of the better layouts I have seen.

This is commonly referred to as a sandbox game as players can do whatever they want.  Attack other people, pick-up and deliver, explore, etc.  I really have to agree with this assessment as the game provides a lot of freedom IF you are just looking to have fun.  If you are trying to win, I find you are a little more forced into a role based on circumstance.

The other issue I have with the game is that it is a roll-move game at its heart.  You can spend your money towards an awesome engine, but that just means you roll a D12 as opposed to another playing rolling a D8 for movement.  The fact that these parts increase the size of the die rather than the number of dice rolled means that better parts lead to greater randomness.

That said, the game is still a blast to play.  More enjoyable if you want to see a random story unfold in front of your eyes rather than play a brain burner of a game for the win.

RATING: 8.5
This is the best example of a sandbox game for me. It has painted spaceship minis, nice thick hex tiles, looks very colorful when set up, and the best metal coin money in any game ever. Aside from components it is a fun and playful silly game, that evokes a Firefly sort of feel. There is quite a bit of luck from dice rolls--roll to move, to fight, to avoid hazards, to harvest goods, to complete quests. Even though I dislike relying on dice rolls for success I still love this one.

One big caveat though is the play time. I would strongly suggest simply setting a time limit and checking high score, or setting a turn limit. Playing to a certain goal can take a long long time. I would play this with 3 players only, 2 is not supported, and 4+ takes way too long. This game might have the worst downtime of any game I own. I have even gone so far as setting time limits on turns just to keep it moving.

Even with what I consider numerous flaws; Xia is still wonderful!

The most EXCITING game in my collection and it plays AMAZINGLY solo. Every game takes you through a very unique journey, no game so far (not even Gloomhaven) has managed to convey such epicness in my mind.

This is the first game I've played in a while that I'm seriously excited about the next time I get to play it.  I had a great time playing it and the theme really came through.  It was also interesting to play a true sandbox game where each turn had tons of possibilities.

My only criticism is possibly the random chance in the game.  There were a lot of times that chance determined whether you got a point or not.  I think it mostly evened out in the end, and the randomness fit the theme as well, so I won't criticize it harshly in this regard.

I've only had the one game so far and I really need to have another for a better opinion. My gut instinct at this stage is that it possibly needed further development. The luck factor feels a bit too much for me (considering the length of the game), and I'm really not sure about the pricing of ships and ship components (they're way too low). And don't use the introductory setup; it's kind of broken. Oh and if you hadn't heard already: outstanding production values!

I consider this essentially a pickup and deliver game. You have to move between planets or you run out of fuel, in the meantime picking up missions which require you to go to one place and then the other, or alternatively buying goods in one location and then selling in another. 

In my opinion pickup and deliver games always suffer from significant downtime and can be slightly boring. These types of games lack the engine of typical euro games, and often create such large space between players such that interaction is also lacking. While Xia did have higher interaction that most pickup and deliver games I have played, it still didn't excite me. The components were quite cool however.

I've only just begun to delve into this. The sandbox feel is strong and satisfying, players feel empowered to pursue a wide variety of starship-captainy activities without being locked into a taken path. The opportunist "go where the money is" approach feels very thematic, rules are plenty, but mostly boil down to "roll a die, consult a chart". Downtime can definitely become and issue, so 3, maybe 4 players, seems to be the way to go. Warning: There's no reliable catch-up mechanism, so prepare to get screwed out of running for the win by a string of bad dice rolls on occasion.

A beautiful looking game and I love the pre-painted ships! Ability to play shorter or longer games is an excellent feature. More luck based than the heavier space themed board games like Eclipse or Twilight Imperium, but this is a more casual fun game. Can be modded to alter the gameplay quite easily, fan created expansions are available with an official expansion on the way!

I like most of it except the rules.

Why I got rid of it:

Rare numbers on a d20 still come up a lot, so having terrible consequences happen on say a 1-3 sucks.  I love the idea of critical failure but it has to be truly rare for it to work.  The graphic design also had too many bright colors.  I know that is just me but it added to the dislike.  Getting back to the randomness, it was in every aspect of this game.  Random combat, random explore, random mining and all very swingy.

After waiting this long to finally see the game, it's rather a disappointment.

The trade system is far too rudimentary to make being a merchant the least bit interesting.

The movement system is just, plain silly.

Combat doesn't work quite right.

The planets are bigger than the space between them.

All in all, I should have simply waited for someone to reprint SPI's StarTrader.

While I like the idea of a "sandbox" game, I was a little leery about playing this one as I don't actually like "sandbox" games. They feel too directionless and one move of "let's see what happens" can completely ruin the game experience. Not so with Xia. Everything you can do is awesome. I was pleasantly surprised by this one and its easily one of the best I've played in a while.

The game is alright at best. Not the groundbreaking and most amazing game ever that everyone was claiming this game was going to be.

The game has a lot of dice rolling, which I am okay with, but for something of this length I like to have more control over things.

We played to 6 victory points with no NPCs and the game took about 3+ hours. This is considered to be a good setup for learning games but the game is not long enough to get to buy a lot of the components to upgrade your ship or to advance your ship. But I can't see myself playing this game to more VP just because it is so random.

Also getting VPs is extremely random in certain cases, step over this point to see if you get vp.

Even missions are completely random: You went through all this hazzle of trying to accomplish the mission for the last 3 turns? Do a final roll to see if you actually complete it or not. Oh you failed? well there goes your last 3 turns...and each turn takes a long time to get around.

Oh you rolled a 20? here have a victory point just because.

The downtime between turns is also a huge deterrent as well. And if you roll poorly there is no way to mitigate that, so some turns you might not roll good enough to do anything of significance, so now you are sitting for another 10 to 15 minutes before your turn.

Also, the puzzle like component to outfit your ship seems kind of pointless for the most part and it just makes trying to buy the components you want take more time.

Also, I have no idea why this game is considered a sandbox game. The only place I have heard this is from video games, where you can forget about the main story line and do whatever you want. In this game I am still trying to win...I do have a few options to get VPs (a lot of them ridiculously random) but I don't feel like this is a sandbox game...

Overall I think this game tries to accomplish too much and doesn't do anything very well. The game would be definitely more fun if it was shorter and more focused.

Overhyped.  Nice sandbox idea, but the graphics are overdone especially on the board...afraid the whole thing comes off as a bit amateurish. Gameplay consists of lots of dice rolling but not much else. I'd love a nice big space sandbox game, but neither this nor Firefly have hit the mark.

This game is just amazing in so many ways. The wide range of possibilities to win is augmented by the fact you can play this game with as few as two players and as many as five.

I had high expectations here but this is honestly one of the bigger disappointments in years. The downtime is horrendous, I mean really, really terrible and then some. To make matters worse you seldom get affected by other players turns so you're not even interested what happens in the game during the downtime.

Another negative part is the total randomness involved. Don't get me wrong, I love dice but in this game it's just plain stupid how it works. Instead of having some kind of distribution by rolling several dice, it just D6, D8, D12 and so on. Half the game is rolling a D20, if you roll 1-10 bad things happen, 11-20 not so bad or even good sometimes. The thing is the closer you roll to 10 the worse the effect is. So if you roll a 9 you're screwed. Sure you can use shield to try to mitigate the damage, but since all rolls are flat there's a high risk you'll roll low.

The randomness gets even worse when you add some exploration tokens that can either give you 1 Fame Point (think VP), money or simply nothing. You can rack up a lot of VPs by pure luck here. To make things really silly you get a FP every time you roll a natural 20.

I don't think this game is fixable for me, simply too many things I don't enjoy here, the downtime being the worst one.

On its own, I might rate it an 8. The Embers of a Forsaken Star expansion patches the base game. Xia is dripping with theme, theme, theme. Space exploration feels dangerous and fun, and the components are gorgeous. I have a blast, even playing solo. 

Based on the Shut Up and Sit Down review, I tried Merchants and Marauders as well, and though I thoroughly enjoyed the M&M experience, getting your ship blown up in M&M is a lot more punishing than it is in Xia. I like both (very similar) games a lot, but prefer Xia overall.

I keep getting tempted to buy this, but then when I take a closer look I fear that I is just too random for me.  You go mining and your results can range from get one block to take 10 damage.  Your move can vary from 1 o 20 spaces depending on the die roll.  Many things about the game appear to be very well done, but I think Merchants and Marauders and Merchant of Venus will scratch these itches more successfully.

Only 1 play with 3 players, but initial feeling is that there's too much randomness for the length of the game. Not to sound too cliche... but I really dislike the roll and move mechanic here... especially because a large portion of the game is moving from one planet to another. We played a shorter gamer where all points where scored via exploration and pickup/deliver (I think we had one ship upgrade as well) other scoring opportunities may present themselves in a longer game, but I'm not sure I would want to play a longer game. The downtime between turns if fairly extreme as well... 10 mins or so. Play the short game and only for the experience, not a game where you can take the result too seriously.

You get to roll a dice each turn to determine how many action points you get (movement points) and you can randomly be hunted down and killed by your opponents if they choose. As an added bonus, you can randomly win if you roll a 20.... yippee. The game even acknowledges that it is inherently unfair or fun by having a system to give other players incentive to reinvigorate players that would have been knocked out of the game by poor luck.

If the game was somehow about 2-3 hours faster and $70 cheaper, it might be worth it as a extremely light game of hack and slash.

It boils down to an inferior version of Merchants of Venus in practically every way. And Merchants of Venus isn't a particularly good game to begin with.

I can see how people can like this type of game, there are lots of fun type activities that are generally attractive. It has great components and the neat modular board helps keep people distracted from the fact that the game is totally devoid of intelligent design.

[Played with the Embers of a Forsaken Star expansion]
This is the space exploration and adventure game I’ve been looking for. It gives me the sense of exploring different worlds without it ultimately devolving into a naval battle to determine the winner. It’s a true sandbox game in that there isn’t any one way to go about getting VPs. You can mine, trade, pirate, explore – and you’ll do some of most or all of them without necessarily committing to just one. 

This means you may have a mini-action cycle of turns where you’re executing a pickup-and-deliver task to make some money. Then with that money, you trick your ship out to absorb damage so you can better mine or for some battle and go attack players or NPC ships. Along the way you pick up a mission that happens to start where you’re headed. So you plan to do that next. Point is, it’s an open-ended playground for you to build and then execute your plan. 

The attraction here is how sophisticated the different worlds and systems are that you explore and how you fit them into an opportunistic plan to create VPs. You might find a meteor filed to mine or a system that has a gravitational field that will suck you in or a planet where you can do commerce or a dead planet that has artifacts. Without going into too much detail, the tiles are quite interesting and varied in how they work and what they offer both good and bad. 

The nature of a game where the board is revealed during the course of the play means that it’s quite tactical (I prefer opportunistic). When your turn comes around, some new opportunities may have presented themselves which you incorporate into your other goals. Point is, if you like the creativity to figure out a plan and then go execute it, then you’ll like this.

Now let’s talk about the luck. Yes, there’s luck here and you will (should) have a mix of good and bad rolls during the game. They’re what makes the dangerous actions so scary. If you could easily reroll or avoid catastrophes, the game wouldn’t have its teeth. Good news is, you can get killed on a turn and it's not fatal (a setback but not fatal). A friend and I rolled less than a 3 on a D20 and got destroyed in a meteor field, but when we called the game, we were both in the lead. At the same time, you can mitigate damage with shields. Part of good play is knowing which risks to take and when, so maybe you upgrade your ship before taking certain actions.

That said, I do think that you have to approach the game with a bit of a light touch. That is, among equally experienced players, whoever has the best luck with dice rolls and convenient missions will most likely win. But I'm OK with that because of how much I enjoy the gameplay. I think they nailed the feeling of space exploration here. 

Careful on player counts. I would start with no more than 3P until you have experienced players or else the game can drag. 

Side note: For a more strategic/less random but less rich space exploration game, I recommend Solarius Mission. It’s my “poor man’s Xia” but plays in much less time. Full disclosure: that game has some component problems. Get a used copy.

RATING: 9.05
Overall this game is excellent--I still cannot believe it was a first-time design by just some guy who made a game on Kickstarter. The sandbox-style of it really appealed to me, but I have found that is its biggest weakness. It is almost too open-ended. It is similar in play to Merchants and Marauders, but M&M's structure makes it a better game. BUT--this game looks cooler, has modular tiles (which I love), awesome minis, and has a lot of potential for improvement. I am already looking into using the mission cards to set up common goals for the game similar to Firefly: the Boardgame, another similar style game. I think this could put Xia over the top. (Edit: the expansion improves this a ton!)

Definitely have to be in the right mood to play this.  It seems easier to get things done in this game than in Firefly, which I had a terrible first experience with.  It's extremely chaotic, and it did seem that a life of piracy could be quite lucrative if you were the only one on the board pursuing it.

Update after three more plays in as many days -- parts of this game that I used to think were cheesy are really starting to grow on me, and feel thematic.  Yeah, bad rolls suck but it all averages out in the  end.  Really starts to shine with players familiar with the game; I've played it at all player counts now and I feel like three is ideal.  So far nobody has tried direct combat so it's been playing out more of a race for points.

Actually quite enjoyed this one. It is very sandbox style you can pretty much do what you want to begin with, and the actions and turn order are pretty simple and intuitive, thus making game play pretty simple. Dice rolls are used for EVERYTHING however and you can get unlucky, but then since the die are used for everything your luck should even out over the course of the game. 

There is ship customisability however I found it a little limiting, especially as money is actually very tight thus you cannot spend too upgrade/ customise your ship as much as I expected, indeed after the initial purchase of outfits i didn't upgrade my ship even once.

It is a little overlong, we only played to 10VP, not to the full 20 but the game felt like it had run its course, especially as that still clocked in at an hour per player.  I don't think I would want to play this with more than 3-4 players due to the downtime, however I am looking froward to this hitting the table again soon.

A great sandbox game with a same feel as Merchants & Marauders, Gameplay is very streamlined and plays very smooth. Everything makes thematically which makes the game easy to teach and learn.

I like just about everything about the game. The components are all excellent, every detail of this game has been handled with care. The freedom to do whatever you like works great. The NPC's that fly around add a nice touch. The random nature of the board makes every game different. The customization and storage of ships is great and works very well.

I saw a lot of complaints about the randomness of the game, but too me that is one of the appeals of the game. It adds tension to every action you take and when things don't go as planned you have to adjust your plans as best as possible.

This game is an incredibly fun sandbox-style game.  In addition, high quality components and an awesome theme with great attention to detail and backstory make this very flavorful.  Two things keep me from rating this one higher:

1. You need at least 3 people to play.
2. Even a low fame point game can take a very long time (with the potential for much downtime - which really doesn't bother me in this case).

Really looking forward to expansions and more content.

Fantastic, open-world game where players can do pretty much whatever they want. The game took about 2 hours for four players playing until 5 fame, and while that feels like a long time, the game wasn't entirely fulfilling. Additionally the game ended very abruptly on a turn where a player found an exploration token and bought a new ship in the same turn - earning them the two fame that they needed to win.

The game is very bound to random chance. I spawned during the first turn of the game immediately next to a pirate player and was destroyed turn-one. Luckily it didn't set me back at all due to the tier-1 ship death rules. However another player died three turns in a row trying to mine a single resource in a debris field and there was nothing she could do. She earned no fame by the time the game was over.

Automatic death mechanics can be hilarious, but when 3/7 turns were spent not doing anything at all, the game can get a little stale. One almost needs to approach Xia with the same mindset as Galaxy Trucker, where it's ok if you get blown to smithereens. And that's fine for the short version of the game, but for a 6+ hour game playing to 20 fame, it would be simply demoralizing.

Overall, I loved the game. There's so much to do and explore. I can't wait to get more tiles and more ships.

How anybody can play this and have fun is beyond me. 90% of the things you do in the game require rolling a die and see what happens. There's not even an interesting twist to the die roll, it's just as basic as it sounds: you roll bad, you explode; you roll good, you get rich. I would be ok if it was a 15 minutes filler but this is 1-3 h of mindless rolling and downtime with nothing to do.

Terrible, outdated design. Slow, random and boring. Avoid like plague.

RATING: 10
I Kickstarted this game, got it in the mail, played it and it blew my mind! Everything I love about board games is here: exploration, attacking the other players, completing missions, in game trading, upgrading, space ships, and above all a theme that comes jumping off of the table! On top of everything, there's no one way to winning the game. The open sandbox aspect is so amazingly simple and fun so that anyone can find something to do and have fun while doing it.

Top notch from start to finish!
Now all I want are expansions!

This hits a LOT of the elements I want to see in my "dream" game: sandbox space game with customizable ships and somewhat narrative game play.

Unfortunately, it's a bit too random, and a bit too lengthy.  The last game I played took hours to play out five turns (admittedly, with the max player count of 5). One of my turns took about 30 seconds because of some bad luck that meant all I could do was fly once and stop.

I definitely want to play this again, but it's going to have a hard time competing with Firefly and Merchant of Venus for my table time.

Edit: This didn't hit the table again until the expansion came out. I was about to re-rate it much lower, probably around a 4 or 5 before the expansion came out, but the combination of the new stuff in the expansion with rules for two players has pushed this back onto the play list.

Under different circumstances, this game might have become a favorite of ours, but it just didn't work out.

- In her very first turn, in her very first game, my wife went into an asteroid belt and died. She said, "Well, that sucks," and even though she gave the game another try, it left such a bad taste in her mouth the game was never going to recover for her. I think she also jumped into Xia at some point, which, sure, is the price you pay for blindly jumping into a sector, but there are some thematic dissonances as well, like, how could you not see a giant star before slamming into it?

- Which brings up the main criticisms of the game: the roll for movement, the constant dice rolling, the openness of the game. I love the idea of sandbox games, but in practice they tend to lack tension, and as many have noted it's easy for someone to set up a trade route going back and forth and just do that. I tried to attack my friend who had a nice trade route going, but there was little satisfaction in it. The qualities of a sandbox environment made it less interesting for me--I wonder if some future iteration of a sandbox game could channel enough focus for the players to feel more involved with each other somehow.

- Seems a little weird to me someone with a big engine can basically zip around the entire galaxy and take up a lot of time on their turn while other people sit around and watch.

In any case, there are too many games out there for us to hold on to something that had become too flawed to go back to. Shame, because I really wanted to like this world and spend a good amount of time in it.

Beautiful components. Roll the dice for everything, roll & move while mostly just delivering cubes. Some long downtime between turns. Game is far too long (but is definitely entertaining). As far as space themed games that are similar, this beats both Firefly & Merchants of Venus, but theme aside, Merchants & Marauders is a more fulfilling & interactive game in the same vein.

There isn't a game like it. A space trading, exploring, Quest-finding, negotiating, battling sandbox game that allows for radically different player experiences that tell a story.

This may be the best openspace Privateer sort of game out there.  Games last a good amount of time, but they chug along nicely with 3P.  Need to try with more for more interaction (knowing it will add downtime).  There's a fair bit of luck, but it makes for some exciting moments.  Recognizing the value of missions and good trade routes is essential.  It also helps to realize that getting blown up isn't all that bad... sometimes.

We were incorrectly playing that buying and selling cubes was in the Business Phase.  I'm thinking that might be a better way.  Certainly thematic, and it prevents long turns of running between planets.

a fantastic space adventure game with emphasis on pick up and deliver elements. Two main things keep this from a being a 10, the roll and move and the fact that it's really hard to destroy ships and the relatively small reward for doing so. Both of these are largly fixed with the expantion  and therefor is a 10 with the expantion

Received Kickstarter edition with [thing=144485]Sellsword[/thing] September 2014.

***Having played this half a dozen times there's one house rule absolutely necessary to avoid turns being too long: however many mission cards you draw on your turn, you can only look at them and select one after your turn is finished.*** Edit: good news, with the expansion that's now an official rule!

There are a lot of rules to absorb, because it's such a wide open game - you can pretty much do whatever you want - and it's an unapologetic dice fest with great swings of luck. Your first game especially will have a lot of downtime. But it's FUN. The rules are reasonably intuitive, the gameplay is utterly charming, the components are the best you'll ever see, and the moments the game generates are memorable.

The first few times I played this, I found myself weighing up strategies in my head in the middle of the night and longing to play it again.

I recommend Micah Short's brilliant player aid here on BGG.

[user=IgneusManus][/user]

Warning: this game WILL feel slow to start in your first couple of plays, and you WILL get frustrated by bad dice rolls. But, in my experience so far, you WILL want to keep playing, and play again, and again...

Play your first game to 5 or 6 points to get the rules down, then go to at least 10 points to get a decent arc.

--

Played an epic 20 point game with five players and all four NPCs today (and won!). It took five and a half hours (everyone had played at least once before), and it was awesome. About halfway through the game I bought two size-five missiles - MWAHAHAHA! POWER!

--

Won a 20 point 4-player game with NPCs (took five hours). Six games in, I still love this game.

--

Still playing this when I can. Just Kickstarted the expansion!

--

Played a couple of times with the expansion, and I think I'll always use it. The Events (and to a much lesser extent the one-square Outfits and the Market), add a bit of complexity which might tempt me to leave them out with new players. The new rules about picking up missions and dying are essential.

Last night's game was another epic five-and-a-half hour game in which I was the only bad guy (not [i]very[/i] bad - I only killed one person, and not even a player but the Enforcer), I somehow never got a Tier 3 ship, and the final scores were very close (18-18-20).

3-4 players only? That's really odd. But, hey, it's an independent guy publishing his own game, and what a cool idea. Anyone that can come up with an awesome idea like this, and have the balls to publish it himself will easily get $100 out of my pocket.

Plus pre-painted space ships is just awesome.

I think this could work well with 2 players; just play 2 ships each, and they'd just be working in tandem. That seems the most balanced and safest bet for 2 player as far as I can tell. And that's why I took the plunge on a 3-4 player game.

This was far too random, even for me. It's basically choose where to move, and roll dice or draw cards to see what happens.

It's neat in that it's basically Talisman, but with space ships and sci-fi.
However, I already have Talisman, and the game just didn't grab me.

I Kickstarter this game and it took a long time to get the game. The designer was meticulous with the project and it paid off. Fantastic game. Best sandbox game I've ever played, probably the best space themed game I've ever played. Component quality is top notch. Only thing keeping this from being a 10 is I want more. More tiles more ships more NPC's.

I like this game a lot. Nice components for sure. 

Fun playing different ways. Pick up and delivery, completing missions, attacking players etc. I've only played the shorter games up to around 7 Fame Points, so I just barely got my level 2 ship and then ended up winning shortly after with a 2 FP turn. 

There can be some downtime, but too not bad, as it gives you time to re-survey the tiles and your mission cards etc.

There are lots of space exploration games out there, and they all have their merits. Most of the basic elements here can be found in other places. But no other game puts them together quite as well as Xia does. 

Want to explore? Do it. Fight? Do it. Mine? Build? Trade? Kill? It's all here. And each individual element is remarkably intuitive and simple. But together, it creates wonderful strategic choices as to which path (or hybridization of paths) to pursue. Much like the choice about which ship and special ability to take, Xia demands to be played again and again to fully experience all the different elements. It really feels like a vast galaxy, both in theme and mechanics.

Have you seen it? On the table? Real metal interlocking coins. Dozens of unique pre-painted ships. Xia is an explosion of metal, plastic, cardboard, and wood, lavishly illustrated. Table appeal. Eye candy. Call it what you will, it immediately grabs the attention of would-be players and every other passerby. 

Sure, some will complain about an overpowered strategy after one game. Variants and "fixes" abound. But the veterans know that the variability and volatility in the system is a positive thing. Is there an obvious trade route? Well, let's all use it then. Except then you become a sitting duck for the player who decides to focus on combat. Every choice has a counter-choice and no option is without its risks. 

For me, Xia surpasses Eclipse, Firefly, Starcraft, Starfarers and many other games as well. There is a ton that happens in a relatively short time period. It creates great stories and captures the imagination long after the game is over. I can't see this game ever leaving my shelf.

RATING: 1
This game is so stupid it would have never been published by a board game company.. for good reasons.
 Where to start..?

It's roll & move.. meaning you roll dice to see how far you get this turn.. sure this candyland mechanism suits kids-games fine, but is otherwise waaaaay too lucky.

The range of almost all dice rolls are incredible swingy.. if you roll a 1-4 on a d20 your ship is crippled, 5-9 your ship is blown up & on a 20 you get one of 8 VPs you need to win the game.
Strange rules like: a player doesn't get a VP if he sells mixed cargo, but he could dump the cargo into space & sell his "mono" cargo to get a VP & afterwards pick up the cargo that drifted through space.. why..?

Planets are the size of Galaxies, you could either fly one full turn around a planet to get into the "planets door", or the equidistance of three star systems.. why not have planets with a size of one hex..?

And if your ship is heavily damaged, by far the best strategy is to commit suicide by flying through asteriods & respawn in the next turn without any penalty.. why again..

This game is so broken that it should've never been produced.
Sandboxsystem = euphemism for a board game that hasn't been properly playtested

The ideas the designer had are all pretty cool, the cargo management, the ship upgrades, the bounties/enforcer system but it seems to me, that no one (probably out of politeness) ever told him all the things that did not work.

Components & especially the space coins are of very good quality, also the designer seems to be a really nice guy.

RATING: 4
The first few times I played Xia in 2014, I adored it.  It was a big, open world to fly spaceships in and have adventures.  Because it's sort of a bear to teach, it then sat unplayed for a few years until recently, when I broke it out to show a few interested friends.

The game hadn't changed, but I sure had.  Everything-as-a-die roll (with almost no way to mitigate) crushed my soul.  The frustrated lows felt way worse than the fleeting highs.  The Embers expansion does make for a better experience than base Xia, but it's just not a game for me anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
On the plus side, this is clearly a labour of love. The components are very well made (other than the Third World sweat shop paint job on the miniatures) and there's a perfectly workable sandbox here. 
On the negative side, there are at least two house rules that have become more or less universal as a result of clear deficiencies in the rules regarding trade and movement and, worse, while the game gives you a great deal of freedom, you're mostly free to do not much of anything very interesting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The pieces (especially the 20 different painted models of space ships) are very pretty.

The game felt a bit old fashion, turning tiles to explore, buying upgrades to ships, moving around the board, pick up and deliver cubes, picking up secret missions and throwing a D20 for most non-normal moves.

Only partially limited number of actions means a fair bit of down time.  You won't want to play with more than 3 players.

The story arc is mostly the upgraded ships you can buy.  The missions remain the same.

This feels like an experience game for people who want more bling than Merchants of Venus.

There's a lot of cool stuff going on here! I like the different ships and the variable map and the different ways of getting points and how getting a point can be a big deal.

Xia is a great game of space exploration, combat, trading and leveling up! It brought back my memories of all time favourite Elite game (back to 8bits). Looks beautifull and its components certainly add to the overall atmosphere (graphic design could have been better tho). Works well even with 2 players, if you utilize NPCs and some houseruling. Starts little bit too slow, you are basically enjoying the full game after the first hour of play. Once it starts rolling, it is pure joy to play. Waiting for expansion to get more content to it and dreaming about solo variant.

After 1 play with 3 players, this seems like a luckfest that makes Firefly look like Go. Although I was pessimistic after hearing that a natural 20 gets you a victory point, the bulk of the game seems to be decided by single rolls of the dice, and whether the player that has gone for a hostile build targets you and rolls high. I would play this again with four players, but am not optimistic that my opinion would change.

I really wanted to like Xia.  The production value is very high: beautifully illustrated board that is built up as you play in a unique configuration each game, cool metal money, awesome miniatures.  It is neat that you can custom build your ship with different weapons and engines and shields.  After playing this game three times I have no hesitation shouting from the rooftops that this game is quite dull and bores me really hard.  There is TREMENDOUS down time between turns.  Exploration seems like it doesn't pay.  It is boring to buy stuff at x and sell it for 2x what I paid at y. Xia has a magnificent, gorgeous exterior and is a dull game underneath the veneer. I also do not like how much chance/randomness is in Xia.  Players roll dice a lot.  You might get destroyed by an asteroid or you might get a yawn point oops I mean a fame point. When I am playing Xia, I wish it was Carcassonne or Ticket to Ride instead.  I don't enjoy Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne so much--they bore me.

Dear Xia,
    I was super-stoked to give you a play.  You looked great.  Like a fine sports car - the exterior details were just exquisite.  However, once we got going, I immediately realized that the only thing beneath the hood is a random number generator.  It was like putting a lawnmower engine in a Ferrari.  Make a decision, roll a die . . . maybe you get lucky . . . maybe you get crushed.
    In my one game, I got blown out by bad die rolls on the first 3 turns of the game . . . in one case earning residual punishment for rolling badly that would hamstring me for the rest of the 3 hour game - so not only did I not achieve my objective, I get punishment for randomly not achieving my objective.  Failing to do anything for 3 turns meant that I was hopelessly behind the other 3 players . . . whose fortunes were set on a different path then mine by simply rolling dice better.  I get it . . . some of the "random" events are thematic with the game, but when they happen (however rare), it makes for a miserable gaming experience.
    If I was given a copy of this game, I would salvage the primo bits to pimp out other games.
    Maybe my assessment is a little harsh, but when you see such great production value, you expect a game to match.  This game is like the (movie) Avatar of boardgames.

Can't stand games where victory can be determined by a card draw (great, I just drew my last victory point) or 50/50 die roll regardless of most of what happened before.

Played first game w/ 2 player variant (2 ships each, both ships must cross point threshold). Very impressed. A number of house rules needed to maximize the game and downplay some luck factors, but overall very well done.

RATING: 7
A modern Ameritrash masterpiece, with all that goes along with it. I wanted so much to love this, as the components are fantastic and the premise (trading/exploring/fighting in space) is immediately appealing to me. Ultimately, however, there is way too much randomness in this game. I no longer have the patience to sit through a three-hour game whose outcome is determined primarily by chance, particularly when the narrative isn't strong enough to tie it all together.

Kickstarted and very excited.  Best Kickstarter project I have ever seen.  Awesome theme and great development by the designer before the game was ever put on Kickstarter.

Delivered in October 2014 - great product!  Was a great Kickstarter the whole way through, with great communication, and great component quality.  Had backed 2 copies for a total of $150, sold one of them for $140 on arrival, leaving my copy as heavily subsidized.

What it lacks in narrative (extremely lacking) it makes up for in component quality, interesting choices, and pure beauty. Somebody write an RPG system to use while moving the pieces around and I'll be in Heaven.

Xia is fun not serious sci-fi themed sandbox game.  Players start with a small spaceship and cruise around exploring new tiles, trading goods from one planet to another, performing missions, and mining resources to get money and points.  A fun aspect is that the ships each have a special power and can be customized with ship parts that improve their movement, shields, and weapons.  The ships can be upgraded to tier 2 and 3 ships and each time the power of the previous ship(s) carries over, resulting in interesting combinations of abilities.  The game is dice-heavy in a way that is intended to result in funny game moments and good stories, although there is enough meaningful choices that it keeps one engaged mentally as well.  While there are many ways for ships to randomly destruct, players can reboot with very little downtime, especially at Tier 1.  Overall, good game play is rewarded but the luck factor keeps things light as long as one does not take it too seriously.  Good replay value.  The quality of the components is very very high, with nice metal coins and space ship minis.  There is a bit of downtime as one waits for the other players to finish their turn so best not to play with more than 3-4 players.

RATING: 7.5
Kickstarted this game and then traded it after 5-6 plays.

Overall, I did think this game was fun.  Ultimately though it felt like the same mechanic over and over but with a different skin.

- Go to point "A".  Roll D20. Go to point "B". Roll D20. -

I might get flak for saying this but while XIA has a fun theme (because the components deliver "simply awesomeness"), it arguably has a very weak theme. 

Why weak?  Because I am not sure I actually feel like I am doing what it says I am supposedly doing.  

Theme ties the story of a game to the experience of the player.  This tells me that the story in XIA is ok, but not good.  Good storied (and themed) games can fool you to believe you are doing something different even if you are performing the same mechanic over and over again.  I realized I was repeatedly doing the same thing around game 3. At that point the cards became fluff and I hardly needed to consult the card (even though I faithfully did) to know what I needed to do. 

The game for me stands as a low 7, however, the incredible "goober" in this game make this game a 7.5.

Far too much depends on swingy dice rolls (such as 1-3 you're destroyed, 4-19 have a prize, 20 have a great big prize).

The roll-to-move-that-many-hexes mechanic is time-consuming and seems wrong to me for a space game.

Too much down-time (based on 4-player) and very little interaction other than getting shot at every turn or so.

Nice spaceships though and the other players seemed to like it.

Backed on Kickstarter thanks to Tom Vasel's comment on The Dice Tower about playing a prototype and how impressed he was. Projects like this are what I love about Kickstarter. Cody ran this project like a consummate professional with weekly updates. The game is fun. It reminds me a lot of Merchants and Marauders mixed with Merchants of Venus. The metal coins are absolutely beautiful and the components are top-notch.

Kickstarted with Sellsword...

This is a really good and thematic game.  This may turn into a 10 at some point.  I need to play it more before I decide.

As a designer, I appreciate the loving attention to detail that is obvious throughout the game.  Kudos to Cody for putting in so much effort.

At the same time, I wonder if there are some things that could be done better.  I think this was Cody's first game and it shows just a little.  A developer may have made this game unbelievably good.  Of course, I need to play it more before I render that judgement.  It is just a suspicion at this point.  However, this is a sand box game with a devoted fan community so I have no doubt that variants will happen automatically.  So, even if that is the case, it is of little import.

Update - the drag on this game is the time.  I still appreciate this game, but dropped the rating from a 9 to an 8.

RATING: 4
very average.  Certainly, a labor of love.  The rules aren't bad but the game feels like it is missing about five or six key important things.
Quick ways I think might improve the game you might ask?  Dice rolling with six sided dice.  Or the d8, d12, and d20 should not include a certain amount of the lower numbers.  Think similarly to formula De's dice.  

Better engines get more dice.  Speaking of bigger engines, there should be more spaces where you can arm the engine if the engine is upgraded.

There should be an event deck.
There should be more gates that are added via event cards, missions, etc. 

Missions that involve shuttling should be from one kind of regions (meteors) to another kind of region.  It kind of really sucks when you can't reach the destination because it is not on the board yet.  That or you can keep three missions, but you can only get one per get mission search action.  You could even state you can only do one mission action per turn but you can spend extra energy to draw and keep more missions.

There needs to be an NPC deck to control, or develop the Outlaw and Sheriff (what I call him).

There needs to be a way to gain objects that would allow you to reroll.  Call them one time bonuses that could be bought or found.  Or call them luck or fate points that can be spent anytime to reroll or effect dice.

I understand there are plenty of people who like the game and are willing to create their own house rules.  However, I would rather buy a game that feels complete to me.

Good but not great. 

I was frustrated by the dependence on dice rolls for literally everything. They can be cripplingly unlucky at times, with literally no way to mitigate that luck, or affect the outcome. 

It also felt a bit sluggish and draggy. Major downtime between turns. Maybe if it had lasted 2 hours instead of 3+ I wouldn't have thought so. Maybe playing with 3 players instead of 4? Hard to say, it was a learner game, and I'd definitely play again.

Comparisons to Merchants & Marauders are definitely warranted, with either game having its pros & cons. I think I definitely prefer M&M for its theme, and somewhat more fluid play.

Not a very good game. While the production value isn't up for debate, the quality of the game design is. While I have no doubt that a lot of design time and effort was put into the development of it, they are ideas that had flaws from their conception. It fails at a lot of concepts at both a thematic level and a mechanism level. It has a lot of really fun ideas, but player power balance, board layout inequalities, and a lack of luck mitigation completely ruin the experience of those fun ideas.

Takes a committed effort (time commitment) to learn the rules.  Random placement of space tiles can lead to some very cumbersome game play.  Needs house rules to smooth out the rough edges of the game.  
Build quality is above average - the ship minis are a great concept and add nice flavor.  The painting quality is not as good as the minis deserve, but its acceptable.  Ship mats are also a neat mechanic, though the markers and outfits are too easily disturbed.  Very cool art work on the game tiles.  The galactic credit coins are awesome - weighty metal with neat embossing and shape.
Potentially tons of fun to play as there are many paths to victory.  It's a game you need to play a handful of times to really get a feel for.

It does a lot of things right, but ultimately Xia has too much downtime to be truly enjoyable. The balance also feels off in many respects, leaving the firm impression that it lacks sufficient playtesting prior to release. (This is reaffirmed by some of the author's KS comments.)

This is by far my favorite space game that I own! Where the game can be pvp you do not have to partake and can simply barter and trade resources to end up the victor. Whatever you choose and however you choose to play can help you win but players do try to keep you from your goal leaving you to have to change tactics on the sly. And the design OMG the design of this game is EPIC from tiny detailed ships to resources and ship building and space credits. This game truly has it all!

Very enjoyable space exploration and mercantile game. We tend to find combat not worthwhile unless a player really wants to play pirate or vs. NPCs, and there's a couple of small issues with VPs and random map layout that the designer seems aware of and may address in the expansion. Was a big fan of the Firefly BG and it is still fun, but feel that Xia is a superior game overall.

(aaaand look, I can see at least two we had, one being scoring a VP for rolling a 20, have been addressed and removed!!)

I really wanted to love this game.  It is a game that is right up my alley, but this game is just "missing" on a number of different areas.  The dice mechanic is just wrong.  It is just way too random.   The combat and/risk through the fields is just way too off balanced.  I don't generally complain about most games.  The balance is just wacked in the game.  With one bad die roll, you can lose your entire ship in one roll.  Someone who is a 20 magnet can win the game in record time. You can nearly take a nap while your buddies take their turn.  The risk is just totally not worth the reward.  On the other hand, the components and the box storage are GREAT!  I'm not sure the game is completely unredeemable, but it needs work.

A sand-box space game that relies on a lot of luck. Movement relies on dice, combat=dice, nothing to modify it with. Only way to potentially get a better roll is to buy a better engine or whatnot, which means you still could roll a 1.  Heck just by rolling a lucky 20 you are one step closer to winning the game. Even with all that luck I still enjoy the game. What I like most are the missions, transporting cargo, and going after players who have bounties on them. It is quite a bit of fun but still some of the luck based things make me cringe such as exploration tokens. One may provide you with a fame point or you can find something that has nothing.

This game makes me sad. Looks like it is an awesome adaption of Elite-style computer games. Components are awesome. But it is stuck in 80ies style game design: Lose a turn after being killed! Respawn somewhere where is NOTHING to do! Spend 2-3 turns fly somewhere where there is something to do! On top of that it is INCREDIBLY RANDOM! And I usually don't mind some randomness in games. 

I don't get how this got any good reviews. Fortunately, I don't own this. If I had a copy, I would toss it into a black hole.

12-01-2014 - I have found the perfect game... And it is Xia.  Ok, maybe a little exaggeration, there are improvements that could be made (a little more variability in ship equipment, perhaps more hexes, encounters that mix things up a bit...), but in general this game is exactly what I look for in a game.  Open, strategic, meaningful decisions, variable length, fantastic minis, and just plain fun.  YMMV.  If this makes sense to you, this is the best way I can put it: This isn't a game you play, it's a game you play WITH.  Awesome sauce and I'm glad to be a part of it.  10 all the way.  Shoot, this one goes up to 11.

Lots of ratings based on gameplay videos and reading the rules... Well I rate games after playing once. And update my ratings if I feel the need to change them.
I own over a thousand games and every game I acquired was an 8 before i bought it.
At the moment i have 66 games rated 8 or higher of the 536 games rated. So based on these comments. i think a fairer rating would be a  6. Even if it looks good and interesting.
However i won't add counter ratings.

Xia: Legends of a Drift System is a 3-5 player sandbox style competitive space adventure. Each player starts as a lowly but hopeful captain of a small starship.

Players fly their ships about the system, completing a variety of missions, exploring new sectors and battling other ships. Navigating hazardous environments, players choose to mine, salvage, or trade valuable cargo. Captains vie with each other for Titles, riches, and most importantly Fame.

The most adaptive, risk taking, and creative players will excel. One captain will rise above the others, surpassing mortality by becoming Legend!

Overall it is a fun sandbox game. For my personal taste there are way too much luck based decisions. From time to time it feels like playing a PnP in space, where every action needs a roll to see if I succeed. I think it is thematically irritating that my engine either flies me 3 or 24 spaces depending on how lucky I am. Is the pilot drunk? Does he fly in circles? I mean what is the thematic justification for this mechanic? I get that it makes sense to roll, when attempting to fly through an asteroid field or trying to sneek into a hostile planet, but not how fast my engine decides to be today. "Sorry today is Beetle day, no more Ferrari" :P
This game also definately has a Leader-runaway Problem. 

I believe most issues are fixed in the addon, which is sadly not available at the moment. Hopefully there will be another printing, where the expansion changes are implemented in the base game, as they fix a lot of pure luck elements, that have no thematical reference.

RATING: N/A
Note: Moddable game, gives interesting potential.

After a video review: Very interesting concept that feels like an open world game. There is a lot of path to victory and the game can be played very different.

I feel this should have been playable as a solitaire game. Still, there is a lot of mods out there that could just do this.

I don't like much the tile design for space map and ships. I would have preferred area to area movement, rather than individual hex.

It reminds me of Merchant of Venus and Firefly but using a different approach.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed this one as a simple and straightforward spaceship adventure. I'd recommend playing with NPCs to keep the game a bit more interesting. Destroying another player actually isn't exceptionally annoying other than the fact that you have a random roll to determine where you restart next turn. There is quite a bit left to randomness of the die roll without much chance to modify the die roll - outside of using shields to reduce damage and such. In general, this is probably best with 3 initially although 4 is okay once people figure out the game turn (there is a fair bit of downtime otherwise). At this point, I like it and plan to give it a few more plays - perhaps with the Monday night group. 

If you are looking for a highly strategic game, this isn't it. There are choices to be made, but rules such as any time you roll a 20 you gain a point seem odd (never happened in my first game). It isn't heavy by any stretch of the imagination.

It's one that got away. I so wanted to like this, but it could very easily be a design from the 1970's with its hideous randomness. That's not to say that there aren't some things going for it and I haven't given up on it yet, but the trade goods just feel totally generic (inexcusable in a game like this) and if you get hammered by the dice early then you're just a spectator for 4 hours.

Xia is an awesome game! Be a trader, a pirate, an explorer, a theif, a taxi, etc, whatever you want or swap the roles as you wish throughout. Me and my fellow gamers agree its the 1st board game you can just do what YOU want. With there being no 'success model' players do their own thing and quite often the new comers can win as easily as the experienced players. Once you've learned all the rules they all make sense when applied to the table. This IS a game I will be keeping an eye out for add-ons and mods. Yes it was expensive, Yes it is worth it!

At last I've played this thing, which I've been thinking about picking up for some time. At $80 it was not something I was going to grab sight unseen, but now I have seen what it has to offer and...well, I'm still not sure.

Honestly there's no compelling reason to own this. It's essentially Merchants and Marauders in Space, and other than the "in space" part, M&M does pretty much everything better. Xia also has a weird rule that I would have to get rid of immediately: roll a 20 on a d20 and get a VP. The winner of our little 5 point baby game got at least 2 points this way, including the final one, and nobody thought that was a nice touch. Any game where this rule survived into the final rulebook is absolutely suspect.

But, that aside, there's definitely some sloppy fun in it. I can't say I didn't enjoy it. I can't say I don't want to play it some more. At half the cost I'd probably pull the trigger, but $80 is still not getting it done.

[microbadge=419][microbadge=5389]

Exploration, quest, and pick-up/deliver game.  A tired and true genre, and Xia has some flash to it.  There's a great deal of replayability in the game due to the large decks and unpredictable board.  The production of the game is high, almost overly so.  Very interesting dynamic in the arming and energy mechanics.

And then the goddamn dice.

I love dice in games.  I think that randomizers are a great way to keep games fresh and dramatic.  However, dice have to be used reasonably and there has to be some mechanism to mitigate absurd die rolls.  Xia fails on these fronts.  All other great mechanics in this game and it still boils down to a roll-and-move game.  More expressive of a roll-and-move game than, say, Talisman, but still suffering from the same general problems.  And I'd rather play Talisman in the end, because Talisman conveys the proper level of strategic complexity in a game that relies so heavily on roll-and-move.

Or I would rather play Merchants and Marauders, since that is a better developed exploration, quest, and pick-up/deliver game, with a better integrated theme to boot.

This game reminds me of the type of game we used to design ourselfs when we were back in highschool. They looked great on the surface but there was no real game inside, just a lot of cool looking bits and boards.

There is hardly any playerinteraction in this design and the downtime is really crippling.

This could have been good, even great.

RATING: 5
I don't understand how this game got a high rating.

I don't mind randomness in my games, but this takes another level.  Roll for combat?  Sure.  Roll to see if I succeed a mission or move?  Nope, especially for a 3+ hour game.

For starters, there are numerous little nuance rules to remember.  Thanks to these wonderful rules, it makes it very hard to teach new players this game.

Furthermore, it's quite clear that despite the years of playtesting, there are so many faults that would otherwise break the so-called sandbox nature of the game.

The game touts its horn suggesting that you can do whatever you want, but that's not entirely true.  Xia is about opportunity spotting and unfortunately, the game favors mainly trading as a prime source of income over everything else.

There are many problems with the other methods, such as exploring, combat, and so forth, but I won't get into details.  In short, this is a pickup and delivery game that lasts 3 hours and tons of dice rolls.

While I understand there is an expansion that supposedly fixes all these problems, I'm spending an additional $60 ontop of the $120 I paid for because the playtesting in the base game was rather weak.

I'll pass.

RATING: 7
Good: 
Diverse ways to earn victory points. Explore, be a pirate and steal, trade goods between planets, even by being lucky and rolling a natural 20. 

Ships actually slot shields, engines, lasers, and missiles in them and can be upgraded on any planet if you have the room and cash. 

You can upgrade ships to larger and more powerful ships. 

Outstanding component quality. Pre-painted ships, metal coins, colorful tiles, etc.

Bad: 
The tiles are drawn at random, so some games can randomly favor one victory type. ie. if a good that can be sold at a planet end up adjacent to each other then the closest player will have a slight advantage to using the short trade route to rapidly upgrade their ship and earn a shipload of victory points.

The game can be lengthy and loses some excitement once all of the tiles have been explored.

A true sci-fi sandbox experience that rewards many different play styles. The rules hold it together nicely and stop it from becoming overly complicated and the components are of a decent quality.

This game gets better with each play. So many interesting strategies to explore! I love how random the universe creation can be because it forces you to change the way you play each time.

We still haven't reached the 3rd tier ships yet but we are having a blast. This game definitely creates some epic stories.

Update- gaming group is still loving this and we are getting faster. We may start limiting mission draws to one card just to speed things up even more.

Update- knocking my score down a bit. The long play time means that it isn't getting played as much.

Update 2- lowered my rating again. It's been replaced by fleet commander and emergence event. The play time is just too long.

No using the same trade route twice in a row
Start with 5K and 1VP, play to 15 points. 
T2 Ship gives 1FP
T3 Ship gives 2FP

Only use 3 Armed Markers max per player. 
You can only use up to 2 move actions per turn
When moving, roll 2 dice and choose the best result (or get 1 re-roll)

No pickup own Jettison cargo, must sell ALL cargo.

T1 Ship Death: Lose 2 Action pst
T2 Ship Death: lose 1 FP
T3 Ship Death: Lose 2FP

Downtime problems: 
When you draw mission cards, do not look at them. Only look at them on other players turn. To start your turn, choose a single mission card. 
You can work on your ship's outfits, purchase ships, etc on other people's turns. If attacked, you must lock in your decision. Otherwise you need to decide by your own turn.

Leave a player marker at your last two sell locations. You can't get an FP by selling here. This prevents trade farming. 

Can only buy 1 ship per turn.

NEGATIVE CRITICISMS

Really frustrated with the dice mechanics.  I dislike a few things about the randomness (notes: any statements of "good/bad/proper" are ONLY for my taste):
 - * Mechanics of upgrading to the next higher range die is too wild (improves averages, but increases the problem of randomness swings).  
 - 50:50 is not a ratio I enjoy. 2:3 (like Summoner Wars) is good because you can count on most successes, but with just enough uncertainty to create excitement and not be deterministic.
 - The difference in penalty and reward is too high for a dice roll (death or stranded vs. nothing happening from one very random die roll).  However, the death penalty for a tier 1 ship is honestly pretty minor.  Loosing turns with tier 2 ships or effectively loosing them being stranded is bad.
 - Roll and move of this nature is frustrating.  The swings of randomness with a range on 1-X is too high for my liking.  Randomness should tweak the details, not leave such a large margin.

For me these frustrations of randomness boil down to creating a disconnect in caring about my character because my actions to save/progress them feel more up to chance than choice.
 
 
POSITIVE RAVINGS

* However, if you like the dice system (first bullet), then I feel the integration of the mechanics of the game is completely wonderful.  Thought I'd hate the "1 point when you roll a 20", but it actually improved the game living within the system (by offsetting some of the risks).  Really, if you like this type of dice system, you will love the mechanics.  So have to give it props for that.

But best of all is the setting and feel of the game.  I had a great time playing even with mechanics I don't enjoy (which is rare).  This is a testament to how wonderful the world Cody created is.
 - The drift system setting doesn't feel like a tacked on excuse to not have a standard solar system.  It adds to the game and creates an exciting atmosphere.
 - More space games should have the "captain of a small ship" setting (I get tired of almost always controlling a faction/society/battalion).  The personal connection you feel is much stronger this way;.
 - The game is gorgeous, and map tiles just make me want to play this game.
 - This is a project of love.  You can tell Cody has poured his soul into the game, and it really shows through the theme and attention to detail.  These things shine through to make it a fun experience if I just take the mechanics for what they are.  I hope if Cody reads this he takes my negative comments for what they are, and realizes that I feel more positively than negatively about the game (I wouldn't write all this otherwise).

Despite how my rating comment might seem (note the rating is above average, which IS good), this is a good game, well put together.  I have the upmost admiration for what the designer has done, and look forward to playing it again.
 
 
FIRST GAME SUGGESTIONS

These suggestions meant to make you not let an early decision ruin part of the game, and to make a game that can drag out and feel long feel more like it's flying.
 - Follow the rules advice for 1st game.
 - Play with 3-4 players (for 1st game).  
 - All players start with an engine (for 1st game).
 - Take a long time for your first 2 laps around the table.  After that (once comfortable with the basics), pass all dice to the next player once you complete your action phase, and have them begin while you are wrapping up the next phases.  You will move so much faster, and feel more involved.  By the end of the game, selecting mission cards should be the only thing that really slows down play (for all games). 
 - Plan your turn out before your turn.  I mean, just have an idea of where you want to go, and consult your mission cards before your turn.  Obviously what other people do can change your mind.  But know your mission cards, locations/other players they care about, and what you want to accomplish.  Don't start your turn going "where did I need to go" (for all games).

I want to like this game for the execution of being a captain in a unique galaxy, being able to choose a course for your crew, gaining fame and money doing it, upgrading your ship with components and/or getting a new ship,  However, the luck of rolling highly variable dice and the imbalance between different tactics severely hurt it

1)It's baffling there is no mechanic that allows you to mitigate the variability of rolling badly on a D8, D12, or D20.
2) Mining/Harvesting are a joke for their severe consequences and low reward.
3) Fighting doesn't look particularly effective.

After only playing the intro setup I could tell this is a rad game! Its fun and thematic. I felt like a covert smuggler dodging the other players bounties on my head. Forget all the "too much luck" haters out there. They can have their dry euros. This game is a blast.  There are lots of way to score points but they make sense. It's not random I put a thing here and now I go up this priest track for points just because.  Rating a 9 after initial wow. Will definitely go to 10 after a full game.

Super fun and engaging game. There is a lot of strategy here, but also a lot of luck, blending the two perfectly. The only down side I can see with this game is that after playing with the expansion, you won't be able to go back to just the base game by itself. Also, some players that hate luck based games might dislike how you might be winning by a lot one minute, out of the game completely the next. Personally, I enjoy it!

RATING: 6
Beautiful components, minis, etc - tons of bling. 

Unbearable with five players - nearly fifteen minutes of downtime between turns, with no way to really plan ahead (since in most cases the board changes too much between turns.) I think in the future I don't want to play this with more that three people. 

Though I like the open-world, narrative quality, it's SO random that it was also often frustrating, rather than fun (in other words, when the results of the random effects were almost all negative, as they were in my case, the game became sort of brutal and irritating.) I don't know that it was too random, but I did notice a snowball effect - one player got lucky early and snowballed incredibly quickly into the second and third tier ships, and once that occurred he was able to spam trade without anyone to really stop him (since by that point his ship was also unkillable due to size.) That perhaps more than anything else is the flaw of this game. Not enough story to make the random elements tolerable, and not enough game to make the runaway leader a situation that players can collude to solve.

I really enjoy the sandbox nature of this.  It allows a lot of ways to go and collect your Fame Points.  Would like to play with 4 or 5 players, with at least one aggressively attacking player.  Would also be interested in a game to at least 10 points to see how the mid-game plays out.

Initial impression after 1 play:  I'll be generous and rate it a '7'.  With repeated plays, I suspect it could drop to a 5 or 6.  On the positive side: everything you do requires a die roll and there are nifty little result charts all over the place.  I felt like that was pretty cool and made the actions seem thematic.  The problem is that there are too many purely random ways of getting victory points and that there was too big a safety net -- your actions never really seemed tense and decisions didn't much seem to matter.  Merchant?  Pirate?  It felt like it didn't matter.  Risk of death?  Who cares, I'll just respawn here.  Risk of getting stranded?  Who cares, I'll use my impulse drive to limp into that planet 3 spaces away.

Absolutely excellent sandbox space merchant/scoundrel RPG game. Plays best with 3 or 4 otherwise there is far too much down time between turns. I even foolishly tried this with 6 players, we could have played a side game or two during the downtime!

Bueno, tengo la obligacion de comentar este grandioso juego, que tengo el placer de jugar desde ayer. Es un juego modo sandbox, 4x con libertad y rejugabilidad. Para mi, esta a la altura de eclipse y sacarlo y guardarlo no es tan engorroso. Nos ponemos en la piel de un piloto de nave alrededor del sistema solar "xia" y tenemos que hacernos un nombre. El mas famoso de los pilotos ganara la partida.

Fantastic components and solid - but not perfect - gameplay. The sweet spot seems to be three players since there's downtime between turns (although play speeds up as players get more familiar with the rules). I'll need to play with NPC characters for my second game which should add more conflict than my first game.

This feels like a game I could have designed in 4th or 5th grade. Want to move? Roll some dice. Want to shoot something? Roll some dice. Want to pass a test? Roll some dice. Dice, dice, dice. For a game this long, it shouldn't have anywhere near this much randomness. Not to mention that exploration, the one thing I wanted to pursue in this so-called "sandbox game," is limited to the 15 or so tiles the game comes with, so ultimately you're either fulfilling missions or attacking each other. I much prefer Firefly to this game, and I would probably even play Merchant of Venus over this if given the choice.

Xia is a big, "dumb," awesome game.  It's loaded with flavor and theme, super fun to play once you figure out the rules (and there are a bunch of them), and just a great time overall.  My biggest issue with it is that it definitely has some downtime issues; I would never play this one with more than 3.

RATING: 7.7
A very well run kickstater project by a dedicated amateur designer.

The game delivers what was promised, a light pirates-in-space game with simple and consistent mechanics plus nice components.

Probably best ignored if you are a 'strategy buff' as it's much more about psyching-out your opponent and adapting to opportunities. There's enough luck in the game to ensure that  new/younger players will stand a chance against those with more experience, this may make it too unpredictable for some people.

RATING: 8
First proper game today, though we played only two players because it was a rules clearing for tomorrow when we will have more people playing it. Really really enjoyed it. It was the first time we have had the NPC ships going and WOW they really made the game better. I have found that the game can really be set in its path early if two worlds appear close by that are buy/sell partners...someone that capitalizes on that quickly goes quite far ahead.

---------------

You just have to go with it in this game. There are wild swings of luck and sometimes someone can jump out to a ridiculous lead based on a quick turn around of trade and the like. I am not thoroughly convinced that you can win without doing some level of trade to begin with. Each time I play this game, I try to focus on just ONE certain aspect and try and milk that for points, but the trading - especially salvaging - aspects of the game give you the best chance. Also, the game loses a little bit of its thematic excitement with me because salvaging, harvesting and mining are all done the exact same way...

Way too long with 4 players. Way way too much downtime. You basically just sit there doing nothing until your next turn, then if the dice rolls don't go your way your turn ends up a complete waste and you sit there for another 10 min until it's your turn again. Also, there are some challenges on the board that nobody uses because they are way to dangerous to even try. This game needed more play testing before it was released. It is beautiful and I wanted to like it, but I will never attempt it again. I have given it twice to win me over and after about 7 hours of play, I have learned my lesson.

Don't stare too closely into the sun here.  You must be willing to accept the very fickle fate of the dice in Xia.  But if you can handle that randomness... there is a ton of fun to be had here.  It's like the Firefly version of Tales of the Arabian Nights, or vice versa.  It's a massive open box of every space trope you've ever seen.

Much like TI, which clearly inspired some of it, this game will be improved with a second version to clean up some of the irregularities.  If you can deal with those rough edges, though, Xia is an amazing diamond in the rough.

RATING: 8
A ridiculous amount of fun, and totally freeform in how you get to the finish line. We had a session where I got 4 of the 10 VP in one turn with some ridiculous rolling, and then I decided to finish the game off by buying a D20 missile and crushing someone. Well, I rolled badly the rest of the game and couldn't put it away, so I was passed up at the finish line by a craftier player. So fun!

Ultra-blinged version of a Merchants & Marauders-like game, over-seasoned with Merchants of Venus. Open-ended "sandbox" space adventure. Has some minor problems with pacing. Can already see the need for expansion to keep stuff fresh. Can totally see playing this on and off for a while, and maybe experimenting with the "dev kit" spare bits that came with the box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think this rating drops by 1 with every additional player over 3, as the downtime in this game is considerable. As your turn starts, you might have a good idea of what you'd like to do, but given your movement this turn is die-dependant, where each move could be either 1 space or up to 12 spaces, intra-turn reassessment is rife. Attacks have the same variability. As a result, a lot of your success in this game is outside your control - if you can't gladly suffer both downtime and huge luck, don't play. I do like the ability to choose your own destiny boy-adventure style - configure your ship the way you want to suit your plan of running off exploring, doing missions, running trade routes, or shooting up NPCs and other players. There's lots of way of scoring VP's, and this saves the game, allowing you to play and enjoy in "see what happens" mode. You can also choose game length to suit. Choosing combinations of ship powers also provides some interesting tech combinations to explore. These upsides don't entirely mitigate the downsides, but they at least make the game explorable for those who are happy to go along with the ride and won't flip the table at rolling successive 1's.

Has a few issues addressed with house rules.
1) When rolling engines, roll twice, pick larger number.
2) When drawing a planet tile, if a good is shared between an adjacent tile, draw a new tile and then shuffle the first tile back in the stack. (if last tile, use one of the 'blank' space tiles instead)

2 Plays - This game offers lots of great strategic decisions, alongside plenty of dice rolling, which of course introduces some luck elements. I'm not sure if this is a game where you bring your 'optimal move' mind, but rather the 'lets just have some fun and do crazy shit' mind. Some interesting push your luck elements, with the game sometimes encouraging you to do stuff that has the chance of causing outright death. A myriad of ways to play makes this very fun. Ultimately, On a personal note, I found myself not caring if I won or lost, and although I'm not really a competitive person, I do feel that tension is needed here. Would have rated higher otherwise. Great mechanisms and ideas. Even from the first playthrough, we didn't experience much downtime.

Xia is a pretty open-ended space exploration game, where you take on the role of a starship captain, attempting to earn money to improve your ship as well as perform various tasks for both victory points and money.  There's a wide variety of things you can do to earn these points, from exploring to trading to blowing things up, and it's really up to the player which approach they want to take.  I feel like there's really a lot to explore here, and I'm favorably inclined toward this type of game anyway.

A beautiful game and obviously a labor of love. Unfortunately the design is marred by two for me deal breaking problems: incredible downtime and wild randomness.
Each player's long and involved moves combined with the flat distribution of the dice system (esp the D20) makes for a very frustrating experience.
During play I kept thinking: "Man, had I been 12 years old and this was afternoon on Christmas day, then I would have thought this was the 'awesomest game evar'!"

*update*

I'm very torn regarding Xia. The jaded board gamer in me wants to dismiss it as per the reasons given above, but the adventure gamer in me can't help to marvel at the emergent storytelling.

This is a pickup and deliver game in a similar vein to Merchant of Venus, but is significantly more random. Most of what you try to do in this game is based on die rolls. Roll low on your D20, and the consequences could ruin your next few turns. Roll high, and you get some benefit. The components look good, but I'm not certain the ship abilities are balanced with each other. I would like this game a lot more if rather than upgrading a ship part from rolling a D6 to a D12, instead you upgraded a D6 numbered 1-6 to a D6 numbered 4-9 or something of that nature, because it's frustrating to fail your rolls after paying for upgrades. Additionally, combat needs some work. In general, you are only really vulnerable to being attacked by other players when you are already in trouble. Then, for destroying you players get both points, and you drop your cargo for them to snatch up. This seems odd since you retain everything else. If you upgraded your ship, you also lose a turn. So, in effect, you can spend several turns gathering cargo, fail your movement rolls, run out of energy, be destroyed by another player easily, they get both your cargo (to turn in for money and points), and they get a free point. I can't emphasize enough how much randomness plays into this game.

I rarely gush about games.  Most times, I can find something that irks me about even the best games.  But Xia, oh, sweet Xia...what a fun, beautifully produced, fascinating example of what I feel board games should be.  Yes, there are dice.  And yes, sometimes, they can turn on you.  But when they do, it feels like part of a larger narrative about your upstart pilot.  I've almost never enjoyed a game where even after a loss, I was still deeply satisfied.  
So what keeps me from giving Xia a 10?  It is a question of replayability.  I'm sure it could be played again and again (which, to be fair, I haven't done yet), but there seem to be a couple of strategies that lend themselves to winning (crazy high shields, for example).  I'll re-rate after I feel this concern has been addressed.
But, have no doubt: if you like your games dripping with theme: pick it up.

Another favorite of mine. A sandbox game where there are a number of ways to score Fame (victory) points. Want to be a merchant and travel from planet to planet selling good and score points?

This is a solid space exploration game with lots of fun things to do.  We had a lot of fun with three players.  There is some randomness to the game, so if you are a euro gamer that does not like dice rolls this is not the game for you.  While I know that the designer tried hard on quality control throughout the Kickstarter process, sadly my ship mats and the fame point track have warped badly.  Some of the board tiles have also slightly warped.  There is a bit of time between turns, but once you get onto it the game  moves smoothly.  Would recommend the game with three or four. It may drag with five players.

I REALLY appreciate what they were trying to do here. I love the idea of an open game that you can be who you want. You want to run spice between planets and make tons of money? Be a bounty hunter and go kill targets and return their bodies to different planets? Maybe you want to go fly around and rescue ships that are drifting through space trying to find their way to a planet to re fuel. Its all there. A couple of things keep this from being GREAT in my opinion. Luck can be crippling in a few different ways. One example is in our game I drew a card to go a kill the second player to my left. The second player on my right drew a bounty card for the player on his right SAME PLAYER. Lets just say it can get real un fun real fast for certain players in this scenario. Also if I dont want to be a bounty hunter and keep drawing bounty missions it can get a bit frustrating. Down time in between turns can be a bit of a beast as well. Im interested to give this another go before I give it a final verdict.

This is the the best sandbox style board game out there. This is one of my top 3 games of 20 or so in my collection. There are several different paths to victory and there is no one right or wrong path, and there are so many different ways you can out fit and upgrade your ship. This fact combined with fairly simple rules creates a high replay-ability. I highly recommend this game.

Top marks for aesthetics, theme, and superior bits (the metal coins! the painted minis! the map tiles!). The sandbox nature of the game means that players who don't connect with the theme or who have no desire to roll play will probably not enjoy this as much as they do more structured games. Some of the mechanics could use refinement--the wide range of possible luck can seem unfair when it goes bad.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy playing this game.  The concept is very fresh and the gameplay very fun.  I honestly can't explain why I like it so much because it doesn't have any of the markers of what I normally consider a good game.

The bad:
Downtime can be terrible with new players or over-calculating players.
Extremely luck based, there is very little long-term strategy.
If a player falls behind, there is really no way to catch up.
Some rule ambiguities which require you to have the internet to address.
Horribly organized rule book which seems like it has no order or sensible layout.
The game should contain quick reference cards for dice roll outcomes, but does not.  You're almost required to print these off yourself or you'll be looking things up in the rule book constantly, which slows gameplay a lot.

The good:
Very interesting and well laid out concept for gameplay.
The game always has you planning on what to do next with anticipation.
A very good representative of the thematic genre, there is a lot of excitement when things go your way.  It will leave you on the edge of your seat wondering if your plan will be successful or not.
Dying is not too detrimental, even if you are killed over and over, you can still come back and pull ahead for the win.

Feels like Firefly, but more open, with more variety, more decisions every turn, less fiddlyness and a greater feeling of control over your actions and their outcome despite the frequent dicerolling. Don't buy Firefly, buy this, unless you're a real Browncoat or it never makes it past the kickstarter phase into retail.

Excellent game.  The definitive thematic sci-fi game.  However, NEVER play with more than 3 players! (downtime is too great)

One of the big cons of this game is that it can be TOO LONG if you aren't careful.  But if you're in the mood for a thematic and immersive space adventure, then this game is great!

I missed out on the kickstarter, so I was really excited for a chance to play this at BGGC.

The table I was at setup the game for 3 players, gave me a quick breakdown of the rules and how VP are earned, before we dove right in. I ended up taking the first turn so the other players could be sure I got the mechanics.

I picked up a little cargo with the remainder of my starting money, then moved a few spaces, before ending my turn, at which point player 2 made a line straight for me, nearly killing me. Player 3 went ahead and finished the job for a quick point, also causing me to lose my cargo, and starting money as a result. I respawned and grabbed a mission on my turn to make up for lost money, only to have players 2 and 3 attack, and kill, me a second time, discarding my mission.

This repeated the entire game, by the end of which I couldn't wait for it to be over. Any time one of the other players was close to death, they would either kill themselves in an asteroid field or ramming another player, ensuring they wouldn't give someone else a VP. The final score was 5 to 4 to 0.

I'll admit the people I played with played a large part in my dislike of the game, but the fact that the mechanics are set up to enable this behavior is a problem. I feel there's little reason to spend several turns on a mission (which have a chance to fail on a bad die roll) when attacking other players and keeping them pinned is a more effective strategy.

I think the game would be more balanced, and encourage players to attempt missions and trade more if there were no Victory points for killing another player. If a player had to choose between earning points for themselves or slowing down another player, PVP would be far less broken, and not encourage players to pick on the weakest so readily.

I am not going to haste in saying this game is a perfect 10. And the reason why that is, is because of how random the game is. But I believe that the randomness is what makes this game what it is. The randomness of the this game makes this space game the best I have ever played. And by best I mean FUN!!!!! this game is loads of fun. this is the reason why I rate this game so high and could possible be rated a 10 IMO. The best joyment with this game is the fact the players that are losing even have a blast while in last place, which is hard to find in any game. Player can do whatever they want and other player will still have a great time playing the game.

RATING: 8
25-03-2015. Rated after 1 play to 10 VPs for a medium length game. The game took us with 4 players about 2.5-3 hours.

Xia is a sandbox game, in which you can determine your own carreer path. You start out in a lousy tier 1 ship and 3k credits. You can spend credits to upgrade your ship to higher tiers (bigger mini's!), all the way up to tier 3. Tier 3 ships are the biggest and can take most damage. In Xia you can also buy multiple upgrades, as long as they fit in the cargo hold of your ship. You can buy guns (d6), better guns (d8) and the best guns (d12), shields that work similarly and ofcourse new engines that also increase the dice that you roll for them.

Your turns are quite complicated, but a handy-dandy ref-sheet is provided with the game. Your ship has 4 action tokens, that you can use to activate locations on your upgrades in order to activate them. If you do so with for example your engine, you roll the corresponding die associated with the particular quality of the engine. Xia is quite the roll and move game, you basically roll d6, d8, d12 and during the game to move around as many steps as you rolled. Beware for dangers, flying into the shiels surrounding planets may make you an outlaw or bounce you back. Asteroid fields can kill you, as when you fly into them you roll a d20. From 11 to 20, you're fine. You roll 10? You take 10 damage! 10!!!! However, when you have used actions like movement, you can only get them back by paying energy. You get those back for free at a planet, but if you don't manage to reach a planet in time.. you are just wondering in the endless, vastness of space limping as far as your base speed (mostly close to 3) will take you.

During your move, you are allowed to take as many small actions as you want, without interrupting movement. These are picking up quests, picking up tokens etc. Full actions have to be executed and cost you your residual movement and give you options to buy/sell goods within a city, mine for resources, scavenge places and solve quests. You are also able to attack your opponent. Two types are reasonably similar. Missiles and Blasters. Basically you use a token to activate the weapons and you roll the associated die. Your opponent may choose to activate shields (as many as he likes) and rolls those dice. You substract his defense value from your total combat value and determine the hits he takes. If this fills his cargo hold competely with damage, he's dead and respawns. IF he had a higher level ship, he loses a turn. Was he an outlaw (ie. interacted at an outlaw location or did something illegal and was caught), you get a bounty.

Wow. I like it. Yeah, it's not perfect. You may actually call it a glorified version of Talisman, but it's fun.

RATING: 7
Pros: 
• Lovely components. 
• Great implementation of sic-fi theme. 
• Fun exploration element that is very well done. 
• Ship outfits are a brilliant idea. 
• This is a very enjoyable gaming experience.

Cons: 
• The pickup and deliver mechanism isn't very interesting for me but it seems to be the most efficient choice for earning points. Other strategies are possible but more expensive and slower. I suppose the interest comes from what else is happening in the game. 
• The roll and move mechanism can be very frustrating, although it is mitigated by the impulse move rule. 
• IMO, Missions should be at the heart of the game, since that seems to be the most direct path for weaving a story into the gameplay, but  they just don't feel as satisfying as they should be. It would be wonderful if a larger story could be told through the missions but how to do that without slowing down the game is a tough design question. Perhaps, something like the adventure book in Above and Below, or the scenario story line in Gloomhaven?
• For my taste, luck is too much of a factor, and I'd like a way to mitigate chance. We've added a house rule that turns the blank exploration tokens into +1 die roll modifiers that can be saved for use. We stole the idea from Dungeon Quest. 

Conclusion: I'm glad to have this game in my collection. It's a game that is often requested for play on game night. I hope that the designer, Cody Miller, continues to work on Xia in the future because I think the game can be even better than it is already. Great work, Cody!

Lots of options and a lot of ways to get back in the game. The painted ships and nicely made components helped with my 'immersion' and added to my overall score, but I'm shallow that way. Biggest knock on the game was the time between turns. I also thought the game ran long, but since game length is determined by a victory point variable I won't knock the game for it.

There aren't many sandbox games with which to compare Xia against, but that only reinforces the depth of its originality.  With multiple styles of play ranging from combat to merchant to explorer and more, it provides a much-needed breath of fresh air to the board game realm.  The theme and components are top-notch, as well.  From pre-painted ships to cool, translucent cubes to amazing metal space credits, there is no shortage of wow factor.

If you like the idea of a sci-fi game that offers interaction, variability, and a bit of luck, then, Xia may be for you.  I highly recommend it.

Genius aesthetcs: mini-ships flying above the board, metal coins, cargo cubes and damage markers, quality art that matches figurines
Play: it's a long game but well worth it when you get to a tier II or III ship. Clever NPC mechanisms to make the game more dynamic.
Challenge: it appears hard to play against the grain. If everyone is playing a merchant style, aggressive pirateering is more difficult. I've yet to play where everyone tries agression, but I imagine it would be hard to be play as a merchant in that scenario.

I finally got a chance to play this and I have to say, I was a bit disappointed.  Too long (3 hours to get to 5 fame with 4p), major downtime between turns, few ways to mitigate bad dice rolls.  There are some elements I liked, but for the most part this fell very flat for me.  There are way too many other games that I'd prefer to play for 3 hours than this one.

Includes space ship miniatures, tile placing board, back stories galore, and multiple ways to play and win, Xia is the only game in my collection that has a 10 out of 10 rating, and that's before i've even played it! 

Roll on March when it finally (hopefully) arrives!

Great game, I typically do not like chance based games but it made for some epic moments.  The main reason it is rated lower is because we modified the rules to make it slightly less chance based.

I backed it and I'd still buy it if it was a retail purchase.  This game is just all types of mostly random fun.  It does have strategy though.  Mathing out the return on mission investments is really fun to do and switching gears in the middle of a game from combat to transporting goods to running missions is just super fun.  It's like riding a space roller coaster with epic fails and amazing victories.  I can't recommend it highly enough for those gamers who want a fun space romp.

RATING: 5
Based on video review:
Seems like a fun game, except for all that die rolling! Would like to try it at least once, but probably someone else's copy -- will pass on the Kickstarter despite all those gorgeous painted minis!

After 1 play, short game to only 7 points; it ended up being less than 90 minutes:
There is some good stuff here:
- the (prototype) bits look great!
- the map-building/exploration is pretty simple and works well, although it could result in supply/demand payoffs that don't make much sense (prices to buy and sell are fixed, not based on distance)
- variety of ships, each with different shapes (which limit what components you can have, and how many goods you can store) and abilities (e.g., pay energy to reroll, pay energy to move further)

But I didn't like:
- the randomness of rolling dice for everything:
... 50/50 chance to get the resource you want or take damage (either lose energy or take damage)
... totally random roll-and-move
... random payoffs for missions
... a third of the discover markers (or whatever they're called) give you 1 VP
... you get a VP whenever you roll a 20! Really?!
- the possibility of attacking each other (we never did in our short game, but I know that would be annoying)

I am more interested in the exploration and pick-up-and-deliver part of the game, and not at all interested in the player-vs-player aspect. As such, I would MUCH rather play Merchant of Venus!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have to start out by saying I was a backer for this Kickstarter project and it was one of the best run Kickstarters I've ever backed.  The people running it did so professionally giving frequent updates, asking the backers for input, and legitimately appeared to be putting their best foot forward to produce the best game possible every step of the way.  Unfortunately after finally getting it in my paws and being able to play it, it fell a little short of expectations for me.

Let me first start out by giving it more praise.  It mostly looks and feels incredible.  The tiles especially.  They displayed gorgeous art while everything was still easy to read and discern and a lot of the important information was printed right on the tiles.  The ships too were...pretty good.  But at this price point getting 21 painted miniatures I feel like you can't be too terribly picky.  Everything looks fantastic sprawled out on the board when you're playing.  The gameplay, once you know what's going on, is also very smooth.  It's obvious a lot of playtesting and refinement went into the game system because everything works together pretty well and players were able to take their turns quickly and with very little flipping back through the rules.

However, it didn't wow me.  Don't get me wrong, it's a fine game.  But it touts itself as a "sandbox game", essentially meaning you can play how you want, but there isn't nearly as much depth or variation as I would expect from a game with that kind of tagline.  You don't even really get to choose to do what you want because there are no opportunity costs for your actions.  Every player ends up doing everything and if you don't you will fall behind.  As an example, one way to get fame points is to fly over exploration tokens, some of them just give a fame point.  Picking them up is also a minor action so there is almost no cost to fly over one and continue your move on the way to some other goal.  There is no reason not to do this, and there are several other examples of the same thing.  I thought we would get to choose whether we wanted to be explorers, or merchants, or pirates, etc.  Instead we all did a little bit of everything.

Also, there were two component issues that really kind of bugged me.  For the most part the ships looked great, and like I said I hesitate to criticize since there are 21 hand painted ships in this box, but many of the colors on the ships were god awful.  My first game I played with a ship called the Easy Tiger and the ship mat and power card depicted a bright banana yellow ship.  The miniature itself was a muddy brown.  If you were a part of the Kickstarter this is even more disappointing because the creators spent a LOOOONG time working with the production people to get the ships right.  To find out the Kickstarter was delayed time and time again to get a mud brown ship that is supposed to be yellow when I was reading updates about how a ship got sent back because the racing stripe didn't go all the way down the side of the ship is really, really disappointing.  I don't care about the length of a racing stripe when my yellow ship is brown.

The other big issue I have is the rulebook.  Lately I've been seeing really poorly laid out rulebooks.  The information is all there but it is delivered in a really nonsensical format.  For example, one of the actions in this game is movement.  Your average board game rules reader is going to be wanting to read the phases of the game, come to actions, and then come to movement and have all the relevant information delivered there.  This makes not only learning the game but referencing information the most convenient.  So when I come to the movement section I want to be told the basics of the action, I want engines (the main way you move in the game) described in detail, and I want the terrain described in detail (since it matters most to movement).  Instead this rulebook explains engines to you toward the front of the rulebook before even telling you how to play, then introduces play order and actions including movement, THEN after all the actions are described has information on the different terrain.  This is frustrating beyond end, nobody thinks this is the most efficient way to absorb information and on referencing the rulebook this introduces more downtime into the game artificially as you flip through trying to find what you need.

In the end I really do like the game.  It's just a wee bit lighter and not as deep as what I was expecting.  But once you know what it is, it's a pretty good experience.  And because it's lighter weight than I expected it is also more accessible (as long as I tell them the rules instead of letting them struggle with the rulebook).  And the mistakes made in production are not game breaking so they can be forgiven for a first game from a new publisher.

 God, ugh. There was some real potential involved, like I did like the Tetris equipment (although I wish there were more than just iterations of the same systems with higher numbers), I like how your ships kept upgrades as you rose in tiers, and pick up and deliver is a pretty tried and true concept. But that seems to be about the extent of the designers' creativity, since everything else about the mechanics is the laziest thing imaginable. Want to move? Roll a die! Want to shoot something? Roll a die! Want to roll a die? Roll a die! The last one may be an exaggeration, but God. And it's not like the same sort of randomness of say Eldritch or even Arkham Horror, since your die roll is not a pass or fail thing. Shit, I might have felt better if you just straight up failed to initiate your engine, than to roll a 1, 1, and 2 to roll to move, while your friend gets a 5, 5 and 6 (actually happened). Die rolls range from anything from a somewhat reasonable D6 to a goddamn D20, so the range is HUUUUGE.

Quest rewards, which often take a good number of turns to even START, have variable rewards, so a quest that you started may only be worth 1k money, which might buy you a shitty ship system, while your friend's, whose quest may be of comparable difficulty, will be worth 5k money, which can buy you an entire ship upgrade or a max and a medium level ship system, all based on a D20. The absolute worst implementation of this is with any sort of stellar anomaly, like an asteroid field, where you roll a D20. On a 11-20, nothing happens. On a 1-10, not only do you take damage, you take damage equal to the number you rolled. So imagine my horror when I passed through an asteroid field, not realizing this, and rolling a 9. My ship had 10 HPs, and all that damage crippled my systems.

Oh yeah, did you know that if you roll a natural 20, you get a victory point?

God, I don't think I've been so disappointed in a game since Android. The weird thing is that it probably wouldn't even take that much effort to make it work, but the designers just decided to give up at some point and focused on the admittedly cool physical components.

An excellent Sandbox Sci-Fi exploration game. Some strategies work better than others but the way the galaxy is built and how ships upgrade and combine abilities really give this a lot of replayability. n fact, it really benefits from repeated plays. Plus I love the inclusion of NPCs.

I have no idea how to rate this game.  I love the theme and the ships.  I like most of the mechanics.  I loathe certain bizzare choices they made (an entire point just for rolling a 20?!?).  Aspects of the expansion apparently both make the game much better and much worse.  It's a huge, interesting mess that I thoroughly enjoyed playing, and I'd like to play some more.

Love this game. Can play a ten point game in about 3 hours from setup to tear down. 4X game with a lot of possibilities. The expansion coming out early 2016 should fix some issues with trading but it all comes down to how well the players police it themselves right now (i.e. if there is an easy trade route, it's also an easy way to ambush/destroy people).

 Huge, mad and somewhat wonky, this game is great fun. It's hugely influenced by luck, but somehow that doesn't matter. It's a sandbox in terms of what you can do in the game but also, I think, in how you play it. I've never seen a game with more scope for house rules and variants.

RATING: 8.5
We played a very quick game (5 fame points).  I liked the sandbox feel where I can go about everything however I want to.  The combat mechanisms are cool, in that someone wanting to do that isn't always encouraged to do so.  There should be a reason they are attacking another individual, otherwise they're just being a dick.  Components are very well done, especially the coins and the ships.  Rule book is also well done, it is designed in the vain of Fantasy Flight's rule reference books where looking something up is not difficult.  organized very well as a whole.  Want to play some more at some point to better utilize the strategies.

After a 10 point game - Rob ran away with it.  He explored faster than anyone else and was able to rack up points that way.  Neither Vincent nor I did much to stop him.  We probably should have bought weapons to attack him and slow him down.  I really want to like this game, all of the components are fantastic and the game in theory sounds spectacular.  But after a couple of plays I have this feeling that something is just....off.  I can't put my finger on it, but it needs something.  We had discussions that perhaps it's just too random for my liking, and while I can see that, I'm not so sure that's what it is.  Probably need another play through.

Looks fantastic. There's a lot I like; there's a lot of variety in how to build your ship and what sort of approach to take. The feel of exploring and trading is great, and the NPC ships that move around doing their own thing are cool. On the downside, the game takes too long, is very, very luck heavy, and has several unbalanced abilities and problematic rules. Houseruling some things is pretty much required. Unfortunately, this pretty much kills the game for me; I'm happy to houserule when just playing with Lisa, but this game needs 3+ and I don't like to bring a houseruled game anywhere else.

House rules so far:
* Lose 1 FP if you rescue and attack a player in the same turn.
* Gain a FP when you sell at least 2 goods and all of the goods in your hold that the planet will buy, rather than emptying your hold.
* When you sell, place your spare marker on that planet. You many not gain FP for selling at that planet again while the marker is there.
* Complete an Assassin mission if the target is destroyed for any reason.
* Before rolling for Smuggling, going through Shields or Mining, may activate Blaster dice. Blaster results may be added or subtracted from the result, but if the d20 roll would give the player a bounty, the player gets it regardless of the modified total.
* After taking damage from an attack, a player may Ditch; remove them from the board and treat them as destroyed, but they keep their missions and goods and do not have to miss a turn. The player must pay $1 in repair costs. If they do not have $1, they go into debt and MUST repay the next $1 they get.
* Each outfit may only take an amount of damage equal to its Tier.


Ship Changes:
* Persistent Memory Mag-Harpoon: Can be used on a ship up to 1 tile away; harpoon move is first spend to move adjacent to the target.
* Ghoststalker: Can also skip rolling for a nebula/debris space instead of skipping 1 planetary shield.
* Replicator Drive: Also allows you to use your Tier 1 and Tier 2 abilities twice per round.
* Manchester: Bonus only applies to the first two cubes in each sale.
Long Haul: The shuttle may take two moves and actions. The 2nd move and action may continue where the first one ended or restart from the Long Haul.

Very good game. I feel certain elements are very tightly designed and awesome (ship powers, different path to victory) and 1 or 2 others are less so (penalty when you die, victory point for natural 20). Excellent even when you're afraid to house-rule, but even better when you tweak it a little bit in my opinion.

RATING: 7
Xia is best thought of as a cardboard version of the Elite series of computer games. Players fly around buying and selling goods, mining, exploring the solar system, completing missions, upgrading their ship and attacking other ships. The game does all of the above very well with various rote strategies mixed in with opportunistic point grabbing. The core of the game is dice rolling. You roll to move, roll to mine, roll to attack, roll to sneak, roll defend etc and this definitely gives the game some flavour and excitement. Essentially it's a race to get to X VPs.

I think my biggest problem with the game is that the universe does not feel alive. We played with 3 NPCs and even then the game tends not to be that dynamic in what occurs. 

I'll throw some ideas out at this point.
Aliens on planets with their own objectives/relationships.
Comets that move through the system.
Supply/Demand for each planet - Whenever a good is sold it is placed on the planet. if all spaces are full you cannot sell there. Remove say one cube per round.
Cargo that can affect the player according to certain events/criteria - Think Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space if you like.
Random events table - Perhaps on a roll of a 1, or a 10 (d20) as it might be the worst roll in the game.
Certainly there are some interesting effects available via the ships and Titles but it would also be good to be able to discover some of these things by chance.
Mission structure - there is definitely space for some more variety in the mission structure and the exploration of the universe. 

As you may have gathered the game is not quite what I want it to be. While I appreciate the balance of the game I'd rather have a game that tells a great story and for that you need interesting things to occur, and not just interesting dice rolls.  In terms of  flaws my first impression is that damage is worse than death, especially in the early game. I get that the Level 2 ship lose a turn is meant to counteract this but I'd rather see the effect lessened. Crippling someone's ship can be devastating in terms of wasted time and if you don't have money to hand you're better off trying to commit suicide. Perhaps allowing a player to reduce damage by 2 for each piece of cargo they jettison (they cannot pick them up on their turn). Finally exploration also seems like a weak strategy.

I've focused on all the bad here but I do like the game and I love what it wants to be. The fact is we started a short game and ended up playing a normal game as we were enjoying the experience that much. I just want it to have more personality and to react to what the players do. Luckily this game is perfectly suited to house rules and modification, many of which we'll see in short order.

RATING: 6.8
tl;dr: fun, but quite random

This is mostly a pick up and deliver game, but there is also some exploring, engine building and conflict in the mix, which I guess is why some see it as a 4x game. I don't think that is correct though, since you only have one ship and can't build an army to destroy your opponents.
I quite enjoyed most aspects of this game but I do have to say that there are a good amount of (not always streamlined) rules that make the game sound more complicated than it is. And you do have to live with the fact that there is a very sizable luck factor. You can get cards that give you points, but 70% of the time you get cards you can't fulfill because the right systems haven't been discovered yet. So you need to explore more, but that is no guarantee you'll get what you need for your goals to work out.
We only played till 10 points (as pre determined) and that was a bit too short we found, but I can see 20 points taking a bit long with the game overstaying it's welcome.
I only played this with the expansion included. Apparently the luck factor and chaos is even higher in the base game. Lots of the things that are in the expansion felt like they belong in the game and I can't imagine the game without them. So I think the expansion is essential.

Received Xia Thursday 25th September,

played 4 times, love it

game 1.  5 points 3 x player  enjoyed, explored a lot, traded a lot, then we all realised we needed to score points.

game 2.  10 points 3 x player , great game , started slow, everyone just mooched about doing there own thing (which is easy to do in Xia), then one person decided to go pirate and things got more interesting.

game 3. 15 points 3 x player , everyone was focused right from the start to get 15 points by any means. This is how the game should be played, much more interaction .

game 4. 20 points 2 x player. We tried it 2 player by tweaking the rules to NPC roles and agreeing can only claim a fame point when selling all your cubes if you sell a minimum of 3 cubes, not 2. game worked fine, we will play 2 player often, its good.

Conclusions. Its easy just to get side-tracked in Xia trying out different things (which is great and I suppose the point of a sandbox game), but as soon as as everyone focuses on winning its much more fun.

definitely glad I Kickstarted Xia, its a quality game

  This has become our go-to Space exploration game for me and my boys. I'm trying to concentrate on buying quality games now, and I think we're pretty much set with this one. It would have to be a heck of a game to clear the bar set by Xia.

  For example; everything from the metal coins (unbelievable!) to the painted minis (fantastic) screams quality and a labour of love by the designer. When you open the box, you'll be blown away by everything. It's just an amazing accomplishment really.

  Putting your ship together is so much fun, and you can literally do ANYTHING you want to in this game. It's hard to describe, and I'm probably not doing the game justice, but you aren't pigeonholed into playing one or two 'roles' during the game. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want.

  Not only that, but Cody's customer service is top notch too.

  Worth every penny IMHO. Get this game before it goes OOP.

  I am not connected in any way, shape or form with Far Off Games, just a big fan of the game.

For Xia, there is a certain mindset you need to be in, I feel, in order to play it properly. This is not a game of perfect information. This game is highly random. You will most likely have a decent plan laid out, but it will quickly go sour due to some unlucky dice rolling. It will make you pull your hair out and curse. It will make you resent your friends for ramming you to death just before you reached your destination. It will make you wish you had never picked up dice in the first place.

Having said all that, Xia is an absolute blast to play. You have to go into it knowing that your plans will go south very rapidly and that everything you do can result in disaster. It is sort of like tossing a paper airplane; you can design to the best of your ability, but once it is out of your hands, it just does its thing. But if you can learn to cope with the randomness and enjoy watching terrible and exciting things happen to you and your friends, you will have a good time.

If you haven't heard about the components, they are some of the best I have seen. 

For me, this game is not about playing to win. The dice mechanism and complete randomness of the entire experience make it somewhat of a comedy of errors. When I put this game out in front of my players, I presented my case very clearly to them. I told them that they could play competitively and try to power-game their way to victory, which is certainly a way to go about this game. But I don't go for easy kills or easy victory, but for what will make me and everyone at the table laugh or cheer. That is the route we all normally take when playing this. In the end, it usually gets very competitive, but we are too busy laughing at each others' tragedies and successes to be upset when we thwart each others' plans. 

I gave it a 7 out of 10 because of a few reasons. I am not a fan of down time between turns. Sometimes a person can take around 5-7 minutes for their turn. Luckily for me, my friends and I have good conversations while waiting for our turns to come around, and watching other players take their turns can be nearly as exciting as taking your own turn. Another small downside is the play time. I have a rough time finding a happy medium. A 5 point game is much too short, while a 10 point game with 4 players is nearly 3 hours with my group. Finally, the randomness. Despite what I said earlier, sometimes the randomness can get to you. It's amazing just how often a 1, 2, or 3 shows up on a d20.

Overall, I think you should give it a go. Embrace the randomness.

[size=18][i]A somewhat refined [thing=25292][/thing], but in space![/i][/size]

Xia is a sandbox game, similar to [thing=25292][/thing], where you are flying around a ship trying to acquire glory/fame.  You can get fame by trading goods, performing missions, upgrading your ship, destroying other ships, or exploring.

Some of the differences between the two are:
:star: Xia has a nice exploration component, while Merchants basically has none.
:star: It felt like downtime was less in Xia, but it's close.
:star: Ship customization is more robust in Xia.
:halfstar: You die a lot more in Xia, but at least its less crippling.
:halfstar: You can't steal ships in Xia, but you can at least ram them.
:nostar: A lot of the missions in Xia require specific tiles to be on the board, so they are impossible to complete until the tile comes out.
:nostar: Xia is in space (boring!), while Merchants is the quintessential pirate game.

I think Xia is a mechanically better game, which balances out the fact that I find the theme far less interesting.  I definitely need to try it again.

Xia is such a polished game that it's tough to disparage.  It's as an open-ended galactic gaming environment, but there's little thrill of adventure.  Conflict is unsatisfying (and frequently unnecessary), so players can pursue their own missions alone.  Although the minis are great, the art is washed-out and the hex tiles are samey.  It's a dry achievement.

RATING: 3.5
Hefty doses of Merchant of Venus, Firefly and Mage Knight (the latter in terms of how exploration works and the multi-hex tiles) are what make up Xia.  It's not a terribly original design, but what comes together is quite the sandbox.

It's (sometimes) a fun game that can generate laughs and groans, but I'm not sure if that's because of or in spite of its design.  The design feels very old school, for good and bad.  EVERYTHING is based on dice rolls, so there's not really that much player agency, apart from weighing risks.  The game also takes way too long, with way too much downtime (at least in an epic 5-player game with all the fixings to 20 FP).

UPDATE: Yeah, I'm done with this game.  It's just not nearly interesting enough to justify the time investment.

Great "3X" sandbox style game! Explore - yes! Exploit - yeah! Exterminate - Oh yeah! Expand - nope, nothing like that! 
Actually this is also quite a nice take on the worker placement genre, because your armed markers are at the core nothing but workers you put on your personally assembled "Use spaces". Why is it a nice take? For one because it's in a really beautiful package concerning theme and components and for another: everyone starts with and will never have more than 4 workers. There are ways to add more "workers" by means of your ships energy, but the typical "Get more workers the fastest to perform more actions"-strategy is not a very viable option here.

There are some letdowns however. Downtime is enormous, luck plays a heavy role in this game. But, as said in the beginning, it's a fun 3X experience.

This game is freaking awesome!  Clear rules, easy to figure out, but downtime between turns can be lame.  The NPCs kind of make you have to pay attention, but otherwise, it can be 5-10 minutes between turns.

Xia was my first taste of a cardboard 4X game. Three of us spent five hours playing through a full game. I discovered much of the known universe, built the most streamlined and profitable shipping empire, then broke bad at the most opportune moment in order to capitalize on several achievements and seal the game.

It was fantastic. The graphic design looks great, the flavor text is a hoot to read, the player-driven NPC movement is elegant, and there is enough dice chucking to smooth out bad rolls. I can't wait to play again!

August 2016: For me this would be a great game if movement by dice roll was eliminated. This probably loses it a couple of points. You cannot plan ahead, and have to rethink your turn if the rolls are against you. My only (but huge) flaw. Even the random combat would be okay, if the movement was done differently.

This is an excellent game with great components. If you liked Firefly and you thought it was a half-baked game, this game is for you. The rules are simple. There is a lot of luck, but for some strange reason this is what makes the game to work so well. You will have great stories to tell after you finish each game! For this it takes a solid 10. The rules can be polished easily with some house rules. Certain details have been left out from the rules, but maybe this is intentional so you can add your personal touch in the adventure that you will experience through this game.

After many games: This is an AWESOME game!!!

Xia has many of the features I enjoy in games.  Like Mage Knight, Xia features an exploration tile laying map and a sandbox build.  The long turns makes Xia playable up to only three but that is an issue common to MK.  However, Xia is marred by randomness that cannot be mitigated and no realizable method for holding back a run away winner. Perhaps the issues could be addressed through expansions.  For now Xia is agonizing because of what it could have been.

Kickstarted this on 5/24/2013. DELIVERED 10/11/2014

I haven't been this excited for a new game in a VERY long time. Giving it an Initial Rating of 8 based upon reading the rules and watching gameplay videos.  This game is exactly what I've been looking for!  CANNOT WAIT!!!  Hope it Somehow lives up to the hype! 

10/11/14 Unboxed....Lots of awesomeness here.  Coins, ships, tiles... some ships will require repainting, which I anticipated.  I'll also probably add some additional details to many of the other ships paint jobs.  Very happy I backed Xia!  I'm an unabashed Fan-boy.

10/14/14 Got in first play... and it was awesome!(increased rating to 9). So much replayability and surprising depth despite all of the dice rolls. We just had an absolute blast. Can't wait to use the NPCs. This game is just dripping with theme.  Everyone around the table loved it too.   

10/25/14  After 3rd play (still haven't won yet) this game just keeps getting better for me (rating increased to 9.5). Love the exploration aspect of the game...and how the various borders form unique paths thru the universe as they are laid out. Love the variable ship holds and how that really forces you to prioritize how you upgrade your ship. 

I may be a fan-boy, but So is every person I've played this with so far...  Granted there is a lot of randomness in how the game plays out, but that hasn't been a negative to me (even though I honestly feared it might be).  I also don't feel that randomness determines the victor.  Really happy I backed this.

Broken trade mechanics. One player stumbles upon a short trade route first and bootstraps himself to the best ships and upgrades while everyone else is at starting tier gear. This player either continues to farm to win, or punishes the other players by buying top tier weapons and farming them all game.

Kickstarted. The only game that really gives you this very special feeling of freedom in space. The mechanics are shit though - just dice rolling. A grand tool for telling tall tales though. :P Ultimate sandbox.

Love the overall design and modability of the game. Never going to say no to playing it but the randomization of the board can lead to problematic situations. However, I feel that the spirit of the game supports exploiting anything that comes up/

I can see the appeal, but it doesn't keep me captivated.  Spent 2 hours, failed a couple rolls, managed to deliver 2 cubes.  I'm sure if I played a few more hours some near stuff might have happened, I'd I didn't explode first, but just don't care enough to keep at it.

RATING: 5.5
One of the most beautiful games I ever played, too bad gameplay is only slightly above a roll and move. Dice were in too big of a role which made the game extremely swingy. You throw a die or a few dice for almost everything you do in the game. And when you don't throw dice you turn a token which is really hit or miss, as are also the mission cards. The game is the definition of old-school ameritrash. Still it wasn't a pain to play but that was due to the insanely beautiful components. So I am a bit torn, the theme was definately there and a sandbox in which to play several different interesting space exploration/trade/piracy/younameitstuff roles was strong, but somehow got watered down and ruined by roll and move level mechanics. And my final complaint is downtime, damned downtime. Couldn't the game have been designed at least a little so that you minimized downtime, now it seems to have been maximized leaving you completely without anything to do during the other players turns. Some obvious parts were houseruled to speed up the game but still this was a pain and root cause is so deep in the game design that a few houserules won't be enough.
I can see how some think this game is awesome but for me this is a bit of an anti-game.

Requires houserules, though I don't see that as a problem. Rounds easily become very long - so I think the game is best played with 3 or 4 players. Should contain rules for playing 2 or 1, I'll probably try playing 2 sometime...
Very free game with a great space exploration theme.

With the right crowd and the right mindset, this can be a fun experience. Yes, it's a game but the experience and ride is probably more fun than the destination. The mini ships are nice but the rest of the components are average and what I'd expect in a kickstarters project.

RATING: 9
This game is awesome. I think that the two most apt descriptors I've heard for it is "a game designed by a twelve-year old". Not at all in the sense of this game being childish, but rather in the sense that it is instilled with a chldlike wonder for all that is "awesome". I often find myself describing this game breathlessly:

"And you can be a pirate or a miner or an explorer or an archaeologist and there's a trade route and a cop and a bandit and a mercenary and a space station and you can do missions or upgrade your ship and all the ships are different and they're painted and the coins are metal, and, and..."

Unbelievable.  :-O  Currently my most-desired to play.  If you're playing to at least 15, you don't need any of the mods.  The game is remarkably well balanced in light of the role played by dice.  There are big swings, but they are charming and the game has positively ingenious, subtle catch-up mechanisms.  Different penalties for death at different tiers, ship powers, inability to remove bounty at tier 3, and titles coming out after a player's action phase are just some of the examples.

The system starts small and combat is intense and back and forth. Then, as the system grows, trade, exploration and missions get more important. At the end getting just the right ship with just the right ability leads to victory. This is an amazing experience, though a bit too long to get a 10.

I know that this game is going to sit on the shelf and not get played very often. It doesn't manage 2 players well and is by all reports too long with 5. I need 3-4 hours with only 3-4 players that are all happy to play more involved games and commit to the time investment. It'll happen once in a while and I look forward to when it does.

Awaiting the expansion - I look forward to the 2 player rules and fluctuating market.

First play with the expansion gave me a lot of hope that this game will see more play. It really opens the game out and makes it very enjoyable with 2 players.

Beatiful game, but so crazy random, and the one path to the victory is to find the best possible trade route, and milk it for all it's worth. I would still play this again, as it's just such a fun sandbox, but it doesn't exactly challenge your mind as you play.

Kickstarter 2016. Arrived Juli 2017.
Awesome components and fantastic Kickstarter campaign by Cody Miller/Far Off Games.

This is really a fantastic game, probably one of my favorite of all time!
Components are wonderful and the game play is captivating, with a lot of possible paths to victory and the possibility to change strategy at any moment. The game involves a little bit of luck, but it does not ruin the experience.
Moreover, even with two players (and NPCs) works perfectly!
This is one of those games that, as soon as I am done, I want to play again!

RATING: 7
I have a strange fascination with this game. The main thing that makes this game work is that death tends to have little impact on its victims: Lose what scant cargo you may have been carrying, then respawn at a random spawn point, with damage equal to the awesomeness level of your ship (i.e. enough to balance things). So, players and AIs alike can have missions ranging from delivery to hunting one another, but it all works. For example, an opponent and I were neck and neck, pointwise, much of the game, even though his personal goals and in-game missions mostly involved sacking ships, and I opted (opportunistically) for passive, convenient point-grabs.

If I listed all the things that should piss me off in this game but don't, I would be re-writing the rules. 
This is the best way to roll to move around a random galaxy with instant death rolls, friendly back-stabs, and almost no real goal or reason to the game at all. 
The superb components and fun stores to each ship enhance the feeling that you should actually care that you've spent the entire game doing fuck all and getting blown to hell and back by Billy Big Guns. but you don't because it was fun to see happen. 
This is the ONLY game that has promised to make me feel like a space junker captain with a whole lot of guts and not much else, and delivered. The ship parts are flawless in how they feel like building YOUR ship and not just following a rote upgrade path. 
One minor note is that the Shields are a little overpowered and most of the objective cards are really lame, or poorly balanced, or both. we did some minor house rules and fixed that right up, and the game played wonderfully after that.

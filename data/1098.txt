RATING: 5.5
Flaw in this gem:
All of the villains can be encountered in just one play, like the '60s 'Batman' movie, instead of encountering one or two every game, like the comix.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The mechanics aren't especially well thought-out, but they're not awful.  This is basically a game to play in a light-hearted, "look how silly this card is!" sort of mood.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rated 7 because I used to like this as a young punk 13yo.
Good theme & art based on the 2000AD comics of the time.

RATING: N/A
sadly, unplayed.  apparently a judge dredd "clue" variant

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fair bit of randomness to the outcome but its well suited to the chaotic nature of MegaCity One. It's odd that the judges of MegaCity One seem to want to stab each other in the back rather than collaborate and you can get the classic crime combo of Judge Death guilty of littering but otherwise it's a great nostalgia trip. Not the greatest game but if you enjoyed the comic strip then there's enough here to engage you for a short while.

Rather unoriginal card/board game with a Judge Dredd theme to it.  Didn't find it interesting enough to hold on it it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is the first edition - a 2 part board that is in perfect condition. The cards are very good, but show some play. The tokens are present, but I have added heroclix tokens for the judges - much nicer. The box is in excellent condition
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great old GW game with plenty of action and 'take that'. Just goes on slightly longer than the enjoyment but for people like me who grew up on 2000AD there is nothing quite like taking down a perp for stookie glanding, discovering that the slow driver is actually Judge Death or having an opponent take down some major crime, only to play Edwin Parsey on them "aw shucks, it was me"

RATING: N/A
Shockingly garish board on this one! Each player is a judge who has to arrest more perps and solve more crimes than anyone else. There's perp cards and crime cards for this. Judges have their own cards to help them or penalise other judges. This is one of the only Games Workshop games that I DIDN'T play when I was a kid. It's OK, fast enough, so it didn;t outstay it's welcome.

Due to Games Workshop's recent decision to force BGG to remove most files supporting this and other GW games, I have removed my "6" ranking from this game. I no longer wish to contribute to the game's ranking here on BGG.

RATING: 7
I have to admit that I'm programmed to like this game regardless of its quality.  I love Dredd, 2000AD, Brian Bolland pencils, take that, GW board games, and Umpty Candy.  That being said, Judge Dredd is a great example of a game that is likely garbage but it's something I enjoy anyway because it's fun, thematic, and easy to use to whip a group of nerds into a dice rolling, sh*t talking frenzy.  It's a simple game, basically your judge roams around Mega City One busting perps for various crimes by playing cards and tossing dice.  Other players can bag on you by playing cards that move you around or subtract from your combat score.  That's about it, really but who cares, it's a good time.  A note to those unfamiliar with the Dredd comics- a lot of the theme material in the game is going to be VERY esoteric.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is great fun if you are a fan of the original 2000 AD comics. It has a Munchkin-like feel the way it plays, and I enjoyed the mechanic of being able to use cards to help yourself or hinder other judges. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
 If you enjoy Judge Dredd of 2000ad fame then you will enjoy this game! All the perps and places are right out of the comic strips, along with the crimes and the top cops that stop them.

RATING: 9
Top cop action. This one definetly needs a remake though, as th art is very dated.

RATING: 4.5
Unfortunately, this is a bit broken (lurk around the Grand Halls of Justice and control the game with card-drawing), but the theme is fantastic for those of us who grew up on JD and 2000AD.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
For a long time the best game I have ever played, and it has remained a favourite with me for decades.  Great player interaction (ie backstabbing) makes for a fast a noisy game with excellent replay value.  Production values (especially if you are a 2000AD fan) are top notch.  Simple game mechanics are a pleasure too.

Dice and card draw play a big part in the game so not to be taken too seriously.

great fun game to play. Follows the comic strip closely so fans would enjoy - would note that non fans should find this enjoyable too. The ability to disrupt opponents arrest attemps is one of the best elements of this game - furthermore it isn't particulary easy to arrest the tougher criminals. there isn't heaps of strategy to this so it may not appeal to hardcore gamers but it is a fun game to play over a few beers.

Terrific with 6 players. Might require familiarity with the comic to get all the flavor and humor. The look on an opponent's face when you play "Edwin Parsey" right after he/she arrests Judge Death is worth any price you pay.

This is an older title. I've always been a Judge Dredd fan, which was the reason for me purchasing this title. I think this would be more suitable for younger players or die-hard comic fans. They did a good job capturing the theme but it has a kids game feel to it.

RATING: 5
You know for a metropolis, Mega-City One doesn't seem to have an above average share of serious crime: "Some perp's been peddling old comics!"; "Head for the hills!" Pretty much everything here depends on being lucky enough to draw good cards and roll favourable dice. Ah, the randomness of the 80's. Astonishing to think this was once considered a 'hobby' game.

RATING: 6
I really like this game actually, but can only bring myself to play it every now and then. It is the sort of game you play when you want an evening of frustration, agonised screams and (some) good fun. The whole purpose of the game is to wait until someone uses their Judge Dredd card to bag the richest prize and then play your Edwin Parsey card to make them discard it. But, as those of you who think about these thing will be aware, this only works if you get the Edwin Parsey card.

Actually, we were introduced to the game by friends and then hunted it down on E-Bay so I think we were rather impressed really.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I probably gave it a point more than it deserves for the theme alone. This game is packed with info on the Judge Dredd universe so even if you've never read a comic you know what the judge Dredd world is like. There is a lot of humor in the future. The game itself is kinda blah but can be fun with the right crowd.

It`s taken me over 20 years to get this to the table and have to say the game is o.k but 
1. game ending needs rethink.( game just goes on too long )

If these two things were done this game would still be a worthy addition to any ones game collection

Damn fun game for Dredd fans. A few tweaks to get rid of the dice, and this would be released today as a best-selling euro (although I do tend to say that about quite a lot of games. Still, I think that the card-driven combat is none-too-shabby, and the "Take that! And that! And that!" element makes it very fun, as do the inevitable "Death selling Umpty Candy" "Angel Gang littering" mismatched crime situations.) 

One of Games Workshop's best. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

After 1 play: very repetitive. Too few interesting decisions. Extremely luck-based. Lasted about 2 to 3 times longer than a game like this should. I don't know the comic so I don't find the theme too compelling. All of the fun comes from the people around the table, but there are much better games that also allow that to happen.

RATING: 6
A game of area movement and attempting to arrest criminals (called perps) for various crimes.  Along with playing cards from your hand, players roll dice against a reported crime in attempt to score points.  Mechanically the game is fairly straight forward and the artwork/style of the cards helps the theme considerably, but ultimately the game is just slightly too slow to be overly exciting.  The die rolls add a certain amount of luck, but that can be negated somewhat by playing cards, still after about an hour of doing this it becomes repetitive and slightly boring.

Never read the comics, so the theme has no resonance, but even so I regret the absence of a story arc.

Rating after one partial play (we decided to quit before it was finished). Definitely not my kind of game. Basically a luckfest, no real strategies to be had here.

This has a soft spot in my heart, due to my love of 2000AD. We played this a ton as teens. It is rich in theme, loogs good, and the included books with summaries of all the city blocks, criminals, and their crimes is great fan material.

All that said, the game is sadly not that good.

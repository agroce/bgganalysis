Simple, luck-heavy rummyesque game.  Seems to promise more than it delivers - I'm sure that someone could design a great game out of the basic system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The 10 Days system as a whole is a very good group of games.  The only thing that deducts points is that it's not all that strategic (not saying there's no strategy, just limited) and it can end quick or sometimes last seemingly a long time.  But a great educational game, just not something I would play very often.

This is a pretty good game.  I guess I would rather get 10 Days in Europe or wait for 10 Days in Asia (with NZ and Aussie in it) as Africa doesn't interest me much.  Good fun for 2 though!

I love this game! My group will never turn down a game, and we use it as filler to end the night or as a quick warm up.

RATING: 6
This is a good game to play with the kids.  It teach geography without being blatant about it.  Also, if you pay attention to your opponents selections, 
you can be quite cutthroat about it.

RATING: 1
Exercise in frustration (unless you're one of the "gifted" who are able to win after three turns).  If a useable tile is in the wrong place it's almost impossible to relocate it. Even the "switcheroo" variant doesn't make the game enjoyable. Makes eyes hurt just hunting for countries. I'd rather have a root canal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great simple game.  Another great 2-player option for someone that wants to play with a non-hardcore-gaming spouse.  It's not nearly as good as my first choice for that situation: "Lost Cities," and I'll usually only pull this one out if we've been playing Lost Cities too much recently.

We're getting "10 Days in the USA" to play with the kids.

girlfriends seem to like this more than kids.  very light.  i'm not excited to play it, but once i start it's entertaining enough.  seems great for geography stuff.  africa version is better looking and easier to play with doubled-up countries.  i guess i'd play it again, but i never wanted to open my copy.

Most of my comments from 10 days in the USA still stand.  The only exception is that top-to-bottom in this game is much longer than left to right or top to bottom in the USA...  so this does have a bit of a challenge ontop of it being a place we're unfamiliar with.

The reason why this was 'owned' rather than 'own'...  I didn't have this game come out anymore than 10 days in the USA, and most of the folks I play 10 days in the USA with, would rather see the US map anyway.

The fast playtime makes this an OK game to play, but there really isn't a whole lot of strategy there.  It may be nice as a geography teaching tool, but aside from that it is a bit lacking.

Fun little game, and whenever I teach it, most people want to play it again immediately.  A big hit with my 9-year-old niece.

Definitely has a high luck factor, but the trick is to keep your options open and give yourself maximum flexibility.  If you're stuck waiting for one specific tile, you've lost yourself the game.

An excellent light hearted route connection game.  Very interesting and useful in an educational context as well!

I like the fact that you are constantly looking at a map, and trying to work out where everything is and how that location relates to all those around it.  A very clever little game in that regard.

In Africa they have a saying, "He who pursues a chicken often falls but the chicken has to run" (Ochu nwa okuko nwe ada mana nwa okuko nwe nwe nwe oso.)

Outstanding geography lesson.  When first teaching or learning it is a good idea to play the free Game Table Online version as it has two helpful features for beginners.  The first is that whenever you select a card, the country's location is highlighted on the map.  The second is that every link you create is shown with a blue line. Makes it much easier to get a handle on things.

RATING: 7
Inteeresting little game.  Requires some strategic thought and can be an excellent filler game for longer ones as you can play several games in the span of 30 minutes. There is an element of poker to this game in that you have to keep cool and keep your poker face on when the cards you need hit the discard piles so that makes it challenging as well.  Finally won a four player contest :)
Finally acquired a hard copy 5/2008.

2005: My seven-year-old geography-addicted son's current favorite game.  This is a nice light game that's best with two.  It works very well with people who like to play games, but don't like cutthroat or deep strategy games.  A euro version of Rack-O.

2013: We don't really play this any more, but we still enjoy it.  And my son's geography addiction paid off when he won the state geography bee a few years ago in sixth grade!

Rated 7 after two back-to-back plays. This is a solid family or "gateway" game. Maybe a little chaotic with four, but I bet this is also a decent "spouse game" for two.

There's nothing earth-shattering about it. It's set collection with a map. But you can teach it in a minute, and it teaches you African geography. Pretty neat.

Update: three quick plays with my wife, and with two of them, she and I essentially won after drawing only two or three tiles. Blind luck? Are we simply getting that good? Who knows... but the game needs to last at least a little bit to feel like it has some substance.

Update: Traded away in a math trade along with Jab and Ubongo Duel for Bootleggers. Well, those last couple of plays were a clear signal. I was never motivated to play this game anymore. Too easy, and there's too many other options to consider sitting on my shelf.

10 days in Africa plays just like 10 days in the USA. It is a simple concept but does take some strategy. It's a very nice filler game and we have enjoyed both thoroughly. The games are actually worth picking up simply for the card racks if nothing else. We use them for all sorts of games and mainly for our Ticket to Ride Games.

RATING: 8
There are five Ten Days games of which I have owned and of which I know – USA, Africa, Europe, South America and Asia. The goal of the game is to use country and transportation tiles to complete a 10-day vacation in the continent. They are light, fun strategy games for adults, and they also are terrific for kids 10 and up to play. You also accidentally learn geography along the way, and the country tiles even have the country's capital and population.

The type and number of transportation tiles help distinguish the versions. To me, the more transportation tiles the better because it makes the game easier while not taking away from the strategy. Thus, USA and Africa aren't as good because they only have two types of transportation, whereas Asia is the best version with three types of transportation. But I don't recommend the new South American version with its ugly, confusing map. 

The ultimate experience, though, is to piece the maps together. For instance, if you put four maps together, you can create an unofficial Forty Days around the world! It’s a blast.

Another great game in the 10 days series.  Feels very similar to 10 days in the USA.  Good family game and great for kids for the geography aspect.  This may be my current favorite of the series (need to try Asia and The Americas).

Update:  Having given away my copy of 10 Days in Africa, I recently acquired 10 Days in Beautiful Africa.  Not so beautiful.  The colors are bright which I had thought would be an improvement, but they are more garish than colorful and it is extremely difficult to discern the lime green (yellow?) from the grass green from the brown on the tiles - particularly the planes (the board colors are more easy to discern).  I would take back the bland colors of the original in a heartbeat.

This is the first of the 10 Days in... games I played, and it's one of the best.  Making a 10 day trip by collecting matching tiles is significantly more fun that actually going to some of these places.  Like, the Democratic People's Republic of Congo is awesome in the game, but possibly the worst place on Earth.  The game might as well have been sponsored by the Congo Chamber of Commerce, but it was probably burned to the ground last week.

...anyway the map of Africa makes for a very fun map except for Madagascar which if you draw you might as well flip the table and play Halo instead.  Also, you might even learn something!  Now when people at parties are discussing African politics, I run in and shout "BURKINA FASO" because now I know that is a place that exists.

RATING: 6
A sequel to Europa Tour with a bigger map board. Plays best with 2 players.  I find that with 4 players, the game, for what it is, takes too long.  But 2 players is fine.  You also painlessly get to learn a little geography while you play the game.

RATING: 7.3
Another great entry in the 10 Days series.  The Africa board adds a new twist with Jeep tiles, which allow you to drive through a country, essentially skipping to a country two spaces from your current one.  This small change adds a nice change to the logic you need to do well in the game.

These games are so easy to teach and play, but offer a nice mental challenge.  If you often play with novice gamers or family members, I highly recommend adding one these titles to your collection.

Components: Same nice production as in 10 Days in the USA, but the board is even less attractive. The colors between the cards and their board counterparts are often difficult to discern. My lack of familiarity with African countries makes this theme less appealing than the US edition.

Experience: Amusing connection game, although adds little to the US edition other than variety.

Rated low only because I wouldn't reach for this over the US edition.

Not sure if this is a 7 or 6 for me.  It can be really random when you are drawing the initial 10 tiles.  Seems I'm always scattered about with no cars.  Cars seem really important and if you don't draw them, it makes it really difficult.  So probably not much strategy in this one, but it is still fun for a filler.

RATING: 5
Essentially the same game as Europa Tour, but set in Africa.  Ships are replaced with cars.  Cars are essentially a "wild country", linking two non-adjacent countries together.  I feel they are too powerful.  Still, fun and breezy, but I like Europa Tour more.

RATING: 7
I sort of miss the curved racks from Europa Tour, but the jeeps are more elegant than the boats, and I like that some countries have two cards each.

RATING: 6
This game is hard to rate, because I like the educational aspect of learning all the countries, and I really love how the trip planning mechanic and transportation methods work.  My partner is fascinated with trip planning, so this is one of her favourites.  That said, it is heavily luck based, in some games I have drawn and assembled a starting hand that is only 1 or 2 cards away from winning.  Additionally, as a colourblind gamer, I did have some frustrations playing this game as the colours on the cards are not bold enough to easily differentiate.

Update: After further plays I'm lowering my rating further.  Too many of the decisions you must make in the game are arbitrary, where they have equal chance of helping you or not working out at all.  It's more like a trial and error puzzle solving exercise than a game.  It's still an enjoyable exercise though!
Update 2: I thought I could deal with it but the colourblind issue continues to frustrate me.  It really sucks when you've assembled your whole trip only to find out you used the wrong plane for one connection.
Update 3: We finally just applied some pencil crayon to the green tiles, this helped.

RATING: 6.5
Africa is the second in the series of 10 Days Games and plays up to four people. Each player gets their own wooden card holder which represents the titular 10 days while the centre of the table houses the games board which depicts a map of Africa, broken down into countries. Along with the board are a deck of cards each depicting either a coloured plane, a car or a coloured country from the board. The aim of the game is to connect all 10 days on your wooden board together using cards. You must start and end your journey with a country card and then have any variety of connecting cards between. You may travel across Africa on foot, by car or by plane and the first person to complete the 10 day journey is the winner. A simple and interesting little game which is incredibly quick to teach and learn yet surprisingly difficult to play! The components look and feel very traditional and make the game seem like it stepped out of the 1970s, with the wooden card racks, thick set cards and basic colours on the game board, a welcome relief from the high end components seen in most games these days.

* Played 7 times. Note to self: Never, ever, EVER play this game with 4 players again. Complete lack of control. With 2 players, it is a light fun game with some good planning a good dose of luck, and a short playing time. It really does have a lot of luck -- I have seen players win on the second turn because of a fortuitous tile drawing sequence in the setup phase. Still, it does have that "one more time" factor which si a good sign of excellent filler. [F-R]

This is another game my husband wants to play, so I gave this game a little higher rating than I normally would, because it is such an excellent, educational, family game.  It is very fast (often 5 mins.), with easy rules. A good game for those not into games, but still enjoyable for those who are.  Alan Moon--I like several of his games.  Does not play well with 4.  Best with 3.  I prefer 10 days in Asia to this one & 10 days in the U.S.A.

Very enjoyable, I agree that it is sort of relaxing to play (meaning, I don't find the decisions to be excruciating). I like the board & bits (my cards are new so have not had problems so far), it is very easy to learn (5 minutes), and games are short (15 to 30 minutes). The yellow and orange cards are not wildly distinguishable in low light (but they are different), however, this merely adds a bit of challenge to the game - you have to pay more attention to the actual geography; didn't slow down our game play much at all (it is a slower-paced game, anyway, as others have also experienced). So far, have only played two-player and I like the suggestion of 15 days. Will try it next time!

This is a fun set collecting game, and filler.  There is luck in the draw but the game is not void of decisions.  Creating itineraries that have the greatest number of possibilities is key, and so is knowing when to abandon a set plan.  Timing and risk taking fall into place, and the quick length make this a winning design in my book.  The addition of actually learning geography is a plus, and it doesn't have the feel of an educational game.  Easier than Asia, and on par with Europe.  Africa is #2 on my preferred list of 10 Days games.

10 Days in Africa is probably the most balanced and fun game in the 10 Days series (4 games - USA, Africa, Europe, and Asia at the time of writing).  However, I have yet to play the other ones more than a few times each and may change this opinion with experience.  Africa is certainly easy to pick up and learn and you always feel like you have a chance.  All of the 10 Days games are brilliant for teaching geography to kids, even young kids, and adults alike.  For this teaching reason alone they should be high on your list of purchases.  In addition, 10 Days in Africa is a thoroughly enjoyable, short game.  You can play it several times in one sitting and have quite a different strategic feel each time.  Plenty of replay-ability.  A huge thumbs up for this one.  Love it.

Having enjoyed Europa Tour, I was skeptical about the Africa/USA games.  I figured that the cars would make players' trips too easy to complete, making the game less interesting.  Well, the cars do give you more flexibility, but I've found that this increases the level of strategy and enjoyment.  In Europa Tour, you will often find yourself in a situation where you're just waiting for one or two or three specific countries to show up - if they show up, you'll win;  if not, you won't.  This rarely happens in 10 Days in Africa.  The game plays more fluidly because of the cars, the double occurence of central crossroads countries, and the less fractured geography of the continent.  You're able to reconfigure your trip on the fly, which increases your options and makes for more interesting decisions.  So although Europa Tour is "harder" in terms of the number of turns it should take to complete your trip, I actually think 10 Days in Africa is the better game - not only for casual players but also for gamers.  Note that I play with the tweak/variant that cars cannot be used to travel between two bordering countries.  With this rule, they're not always a no-brainer choice for any spot in your queue.  One final note: 10 Days plays much better for three than does Europa Tour.  It's still best with two, and still a poor choice for four, but the more forgiving geography and the doubling of the central nations eliminates the sort of stalls and soft-locks you can see in 3-player Europa Tour.

Straightforward and easy to teach. Although interaction is minimal, it's important to watch what your opponents are up to. There's very little "screwage" so it's a good choice for those who prefer a less aggressive game.

Although there's a lot of luck in the tile draw, the game does reward planning and analysis in order to maximize the number of good tiles available to you.  

My favourite (and most-played) game in the series.

I play that cars can't be used to travel between countries next to each other. (For example, you can't use a car to travel from Sudan to Chad.) Cars are still great, but not all-powerful and there are circumstances in which you'll actually discard one.

There is no escaping the fact that, like Europa Tour, these versions are primarily light, family games.  Don't enter it expecting it to rise to the same level as meatier games such as Age of Steam or Puerto Rico.  Rather, these games are much more appropriate in family gaming situation or as light fillers.  Further, there is a healthy dose of luck involved, and some folks might find this aspect not to their tastes.  I've always enjoyed Rack-O, however, so I can enjoy any of the 10 Days games for what they are:  Rack-O with a geography lesson.

Quick and easy.  Nice map and a good opportunity to refresh one's geography!  It too often feels like you end up searching for the one elusive tile that will complete your journey, and whoever finds theirs first wins.  That said, it's still an entertaining diversion occasionally.

RATING: 6.5
The 2nd installment in the "10 Days" series of games upgrades the design of "10 Days in the USA".

The colour layout seems to make it more difficult than the USA map to match destinations into your gaps.

There's still a lot of luck and waiting for the right country/state to come out, but the more varied territorial boundaries of Africa make the choices more interesting than the USA map.

I'm rating this a 6.5 based on one play (a solo, 3-player "40 days Around the World" variant), but I suspect that Africa and especially Asia might climb a little with more plays; uncertain about Europe (also currently a 6.5).

This is a game that my wife loves and generally goes over well with most people.  I think it's a decent game.  It seems to me that it's mostly luck, but then my wife goes and wins most of the time.  The key to the game is being flexible and willing to kill your best placements in order to give yourself more options.

Put Rack-O on a map and you get the 10 days series.  It's a good shot of luck with some strategic planning thrown in that plays in about ten minutes.  I highly reccommend this game for non-gamers or couples (great 2 player game).  Africa is the distilled version with no special rules and only three modes of transportation to keep the game fluid and simple like it should be.

This game is another quick, light game that even non-gamers will enjoy.  Gameplay solo or with two players usually takes only about 15-20 minutes and both are enjoyable. 3 players extends this a bit but only to about 30 minutes.  4 players often makes this too long to be worth it.

 This is not a deep game but is one of those good games whose length (if played with 3 or less) is perfect for its depth.  My only complaint would be the shoddy cards/tiles.  They are much thicker than normal cardstock which is a GOOD thing.  However, they are actually made by layering thin fronts and backs onto a thicker card.  These layers nick and show damage after only a few plays.

Moon does his usual heavily luck dependent set collection route connection game (did this come b4 ttr?) draw a card, does it fit route? Yes keep it, no discard it.  There is your decision tree here.

Have now played this edition after 1st playing in the USA, then in Asia. I'd have to say this one is better than Asia... but USA I like slightly better than Africa because I know the map of the USA really well compared to any of the others.  Africa also doesn't seem much different than the USA one... both are cars and planes.  Should note I didn't see a single car in the entire game... and the winner won with a route that had 3 cars!  So luck factor partly won again.

Good light quick game.  I can see this game being great for children learning African geography, as not only do you learn where the countries are on the cards is listed the capital city, population, and square miles of each country.

Is a bit more difficult that it looks, but boils down to a watered down version of Ticket to Ride - which is not a bad thing in this games case.

Heard great things about it being a quick, easy-to-learn game with interesting decisions to make, but there's just too much "luck of the draw" for me. You don't "make decisions" so much as you "gamble on taking one route or the other." It's mostly about those first few tiles you draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Boy, did I play this game with the wrong person! If you don't enjoy sequential puzzle-solving, this game will only piss you off. Stay away! If you don't mind that sort of thing, then this is a clever update on Rack-O that can teach geography while still being a mildly-interesting game. The key to enjoyment is staying flexible in your route-building and being open to changing plans.

Of the 3 I have played (Africa, Asia, Europe), Africa is the weakest. The automobile connection, which is unique to Africa, is FAR to easy a connection to build, which makes this, I suppose, easier for younger players but not as interesting for adults. For this alone I downgraded it a point from the others.

RATING: 5
[>5 plays for the series] This is a very light game that is easy to teach and learn. A good choice for quick filler (<15 minutes in most cases) or for non-gamers. High educational value for young ones. Africa plays pretty much the same as the USA, but with a different map and multiple tiles of some key countries (in lieu of the "wild cards" that are Alaska and Hawaii). See also: 10 Days in USA, Europe, and Asia.

You need to figure out the best route with your cards to make a complete trip from country to country. You have a chance to switch out cards to develop the path. The initial positioning of the cards is critical since you can't move them around. This seems like a good kids game.

Fun light game that you can sometimes win with skill instead of dumb luck.  I don't enjoy the lack of control and for that reason this game doesn't see the table at any 'real' board game sessions.  But in the right situation and with a suitable amount of beer this can be very enjoyable.

After only two plays, routes on this map seems easier to complete than 10 days in USA.  Guessing that those countries with duplicate cards down the middle of the map help speed this along.  In both our back to back games, someone completed a route in 3-4 turns.  Interested to see if this is always so or was just an extreme case of luck.

I wish I had this game when learning geography back in school.  Africa is always the most neglected continent and it's good to at least be able to relate where places are.

Update: Having played other games in the series, this is the one I like best.  I'm not sure if it's because it's the first game in the series I've played, but the way the countries are arranged just makes sense.  Good job, countries of Africa!

This is a nice light game that doesn't take too long to play, and can be a nice change of pace after a more complex game. There is a certainly a lot of luck to what cards you draw and what is available for you to choose on your turn, but you can attempt to maximize your chances of making the necessary connections. There are certainly occasions when it is hard to decide whether you should try to change your plans or keep waiting for a certain card to come up. As a side benefit, I have certainly learned more about African geography from this game.

Card-based connection exercise with an arbitrary turn limit, i.e. suddenly someone finishes their set and it's all over. I can see that some would consider this preferable to Mahjong for reasons of time or fiddliness, but there's also virtually no interaction or even sense of how others are doing.

Growing up, my family would occasionally play Rack-O.  So, when I discovered the 10 Days series, I had to give it a try.  If you like Rack-O, but want more strategy and play options, then this is the game for you.  The map, airplane and car tiles, and color coded tiles make it far superior to Rack-O.  Besides, even my wife who is not into games is almost always willing to play.  So, if you are looking for a good game to play on a date or double date, especially with non-gamer friends, this is a great option!

Excellent as a 2-player game. The game lends itself as an education tool. As a 2-p game the 10 Days series probably rates an 8. This version is good, but the shine has worn off. I currently prefer 10DiEurope.

I've only played two player with my wife so far but we've enjoyed the game. The game is quick and lends itself to several playings back to back. We usually play best 3 out of 5 or best 4 out of 7. However, it's such a simple game that one would probably burn out on it if it was pulled out too often. In other words, it's best played occasionally. A word on the components, the card racks are excellent, solid wood with plenty of heft. The cards themselves are shoddy. The glue job is poor and the face tends to separate from the back. We've already glued several back together. The repair isn't difficult and the cars are good as new, you just shouldn't have to do it for a new game. ***UPDATE*** Many more plays with all number of players. The game is ok for what it does. Non-gamers like it, which is why I keep it around. I'm tired of it.

RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: Create a 10 day travel itinerary through Africa by lining up tiles of countries that border one another.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: Probably the funnest, most engaging way to learn geography 15 minutes at a time. I like that each country tile has the population and area, giving some trivia (non-game related, but interesting) to pass the time with between turns. The simple mechanics of the game are perfect for a targeted younger crowd or group of any ages.

Cons: The gameplay is a little blasé. The game seems mostly decided in the initial drawing of tiles and the rest of it is just a simple draw-and-discard for something that will work. Decisions are never that tough. Sort of a bummer there's a few countries not fully recognized (outlined on the map, but blended into neighboring countries for gameplay purposes).

Other: This game is a little different in that I can't be look at it in terms of gameplay alone. I'm happy to have it in my collection and play it just because I've always wanted to learn the worlds countries better and staring, trying to memorize a map just wasn't enough. So what I appreciate about this game is that it blends two of my interests, games and geography. However, my rating is for the "game" side of it alone.

Best Use: The best darn way to learn geography.

OK game with more to the mechanics than meet the eye and if you want you could screw your opponents by watching what they play.  You need to be flexible and play the odds and watch the cards to win regularly.  Bonus .5 due to Cards having capitals, population and area on them provding an educational mechanism also.  Would have loved if they included the names of other countries like Lesotho and Malawai, etc to round out the geograpical lesson.

Another in the 10 Days series of games, the game is basically what I remember Racko being, but with countries instead of numbers.  It's satisfying to get your route together, but it very much depends on luck of the draw, and it seems impossible to determine what your opponents are after, making the discard a crap shoot.  I think I like it better with 2 than with more, but it's altogether forgettable.

I find 10 Days In Europe to be easier to teach than 10 Days In Africa, as the automobile's leap-frogging is more complicated than Europe's ships.

As the gameplay is virtually the same, the version of 10 Days In... that you choose is really based on personal preference. My girlfriend would like to travel to Africa, so Africa is her favorite, I on the other hand would go to Europe, so Europe is mine.

Well, yeah. OK. A nice idea on the surface, and I still get quite a few kicks out of learning capital cities and geography, but this is terribly reliant on both luck and memory - playing well will demand nothing short of trying to deduce the whereabouts of the whole deck. Best with just two when it becomes most akin to gin rummy. But surely there must be some way of integrating the map into the play better than this?

Lovely components, mind you. Upgraded half a point as the superior 2-player game grows on us.

Good for teaching kids geography. (And for adults). This game seems a little easier than USA, since there are multiples of a few tiles and there are countries with large numbers of adjacent countries so connections are easier to make and the game ends quickly.

If you like the 10 Days series, this is a good buy to add geographical variety. If you haven't played the other games, I would try your local geography first, and then branch out later. But then this might be worth trying if you like African geography.

A fun game, and nicely educational for children (and adults alike. Most Americans don't give a hoot about African geography). Someone who is good at the opening setup phase has a very good advantage. The best part about this game is that with the cars and planes, the path is very mutable. It's rare (and if this happens you should be playing better) that only a draw of one single country will win you the game.

Replacing the boats with cars (which can represent any country) and 5 central areas duplicated means this game is less frustrating than Europa tour, and so increases the possibility of finishing sooner. Also the drafting is reduced to 3 face up choices, yet the game can still move slowly, because game pacing suffers from orientation difficulties and the occasional drawing at the start of the turn. Quiet and nearly always humourless, the only reason I would play it is for the geography lesson I'm getting and the engaging problems the rack imposes. I'm also finding the cards splitting.  Rating is for 2 players as any more increases the frustration of getting the right card (especially if taken from under your nose) and the downtime involved. The main problem I find in the series is the "foggy" status of your opponent: unless you have been following the drafts carefully, it is difficult to divine how well your opponent is doing, so there is no strong sense competition compared to say similar connection games like TransAmerica and the exceptional Expedition.

RATING: 5
-

A fairly quick filler with a big element of luck. The initial setup of the 10 destination tiles offers a tiny amount of control, but from there, pretty much the game plays you. Most decisions are rather simple and straight forward. The luck factor (or is it the randomness factor?) is so high that a game could end in just a few minutes. Still not bad as a filler, or for non-gamers, but I think the replayability value is low.

Interesting game. Every game must be examined on its own merit. My favorites are always deep strategic games where you have to burn your brain to outwit your opponents (T&E or Maharaja for example) Compared to those games most others wouldn't even get a rank. However, that would be comparing apples to Oranges. Wits and Widgets is good at what it does for example, get people laughing and involved at a party (same with Bang). I liked Tiket to Ride or the Fall of Pompei because its a fun light game that is a good game to introduce non-gamers to boardgames. 10 Days in Africa would fit into this category because it is so light you could teach your 5 year old to play it quickly. But this is not why this game stands out, it is first and foremost a game used to teach you geography. If you have kids I imagine you could use this to sneak up on them :) They think they're playing a game, meanwhile they're studying! For this alone, this games deserves a high rank, however the ranking system doesn't reflect that so I will give it a 6 as a game, and an 8 because its good at what it does, which is to teach in a fun way.

This should get at least a 5 if it wasn't for the incredibly bland artwork. I'm very unfamiliar with African geography, so I'm constantly staring at that map.

Another game with more than it appears. It requires the same skills as Gin Rummy: You have to keep track of which tiles have been taken and which have been discarded. There's a limited number of each one. so if you need one country to complete your route, and if it's been taken by your opponent already or buried at the bottom of the discard pile, you're screwed.

Still, it's like Gin Rummy, so it's still hard to pay attention to what your opponent is doing, and probably less useful -- it's much harder to anticipate what route your opponent is making compared to what kind of sets a GIn Rummy player is making. So it definitely feels like multi-player solitaire. That, to me, keeps the rating of this game low. But the rules are incredibly simple so it *should* be non-gamer friendly, if they could get past the blatantly education bent this game has.

I decent "rummy style" game that is enjoyable to play. With good planning and observing what your opponent(s) pick up, you will find that there is some real strategy going on here. It is balanced well against the luck of the draw. Simple game, that seems to improve with repetition. OUT-OF-THE-BOX publishing is proving to be the little engine that could!

Another great 10 Days game. I've learned quite a bit about African geography thanks to it. I found the Car tiles to be perhaps the most powerful of all the transport tiles in the series. I'm thinking of adding South Sudan to the game by drawing the border on the board and turning one of the two Sudan cards into South Sudan

RATING: 6.5
Nice, very light filler.  Given the unique tiles (mostly) and the fact that most people are just searching for the two or three tiles they need to finish their trip, I don't think you can often do much more than hope for lucky tile draws.  Not bad as filler, but not much more there than that.

I snagged this for $2 at Good Will. Clever take on Rummy by using connections on a map instead of sets or runs, while sneakily educating people on their geography. I liked it quite a bit, but like Rummy, the game could end pretty quickly with certain players having a luckier start than others and having more cards ready to go.

Light, quick gameplay that helped teach my kids about Africa.  It's a close enough cousin to RACKO that older light gamers enjoy it.

RATING: 6
A fun little game - works well as a light filler.  The most difficult (if you could call it that) part of the game is getting people to understand "no, you can't move the tiles around.  The first time out, it might take a few minutes to find where all the countries are located.  My son observed "it's a geography lesson disguised as a game", but that does not 'lessen' the enjoyment.  Even with a rules explanation to new players, it plays in about 20 minutes.

RATING: 7
I think the 10 Days games are decent introductory games.  They are light and fun and the mechanics (get things in order) are pretty easy to understand while offering enough variety to keep your interest even if you've played before.  The chance to learn a little geography is also neat..

The more I play it the less I like it.  This game initially feels like it offers meaningful choices, but it really doesn't.  It is all about having just the right card turn up.  The game is like a drawn out lottery with no pay off in the end.    My wife likes the game though, which is why I have played it so much despite disliking the game.

RATING: 6
This game depends more than others on the situation. It's a "9" with people who connect with the topic and enjoy talking about Africa. But if winning is your main objective, you will get frustrated with the game mechanics, and you'd rate it "3".

Another game in the "10 Days" series, all of which I enjoy (so far).  For me, it is essentially a connection game, a type of game that probably would rank as my favorite.  Kind of like an area control train game :)  At any rate, probably the easiest of the series due to doubling up some of the more centrally located areas, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  And you learn some geography, too!  [07/13/2007]

RATING: 7
A rummy-like variant. Players are drafting cards to form a string of cards that connect across different states of Africa.

More fun IMHO than the USA edition as the board is more pleasant on the eye. It has nice helpful aids on each corner of the board. I like the fact that some states have 2 cards each. Good fun. 

The luck aspect can be maddening. Some games are over in a flash because of good tile draw.

My wife and I have done overland trips in Africa, so there's a little extra fun for us here.  The components are hit (the cool wooden racks) and miss (the cards are actually two cards pasted together and many of mine are coming apart).  I also wish the board was more naturalistic (to fit with the racks).  But all in all, we have great fun with this game.

[i]Half Geography Lesson, Half Game! Unfortunately, I Find the Former More Interesting than the Latter.[/i]

I like the geography lesson, and the facts on each tile about each country. Like the colorful map. Puzzly nature and simple rules make this pretty non-gamer friendly. Other than that it's pretty much just a geography lesson as its mostly multiplayer solitaire and a bit simplistic. Jeeps are overpowered and make the puzzle a bit too simple

10 Days In The U.S.A. has probably surpassed Lost Cities as the most requested game by my wife, so I had to buy this edition. I somehow missed out on geography in school, so Africa is all new to me, making this one my most personally educational game. All that and it's fun too.

At first I wondered how this random beginning would lead to strategic choices, but it does. Manage your hand to create a run of cards, as in "No Thanks" or "Racko". The run of cards must correspond to a continuous path on the map.

I've rated 10 Days in Africa higher than 10 Days in the USA only because I am personally able to learn more from it. I already know US geography very well, but in Africa I'm not nearly as well versed. Both games are OK family fare, and my wife enjoys them so that is a plus. Actually it's more than a plus, it's the only reason I play.

RATING: 6
This game is okay, but there is one aspect that I don't like.  Towards the end of the game it is common for each player to be holding out for that last particular card they need for the win.  So what everybody does is draw from the draw pile and then just discard that same card.  So the same set of cards just keep getting cycled through.  I believe the way to fix this is to house rule that you have to keep whatever card you draw, whether from the draw pile or if you are drawing a face up card.  This forces more variety in the cards to choose from.  Other than this issue, I think the game is a fairly good light game that is mostly non-gamer friendly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great light game for everyone, especially casual gamers. And after you play it a few times, you will actually learn something about African geography!

I find all the "10 Days..." games interchangeable, so this is a good representative game for the category, and seems easier to find in trade than some other versions.

RATING: 6.5
[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Basically how badly I want to play it again.  It was an okay game.  It did it's job as a light weight filler since we didn't have time for a longer more complex game.  I think everyone enjoyed it.  I can see where this game (and the others like it) can be kind of good for kids to play to learn both strategy and geography.  The bad is that I never really felt like I had a lot of control over what was happening.  I just sort had to use whatever card randomly was there and hope it would work out.  I ended up winning, but it didn't feel super satisfying in that it sort of seemed like it was just luck in how the cards came out.  I would be up for playing it again, but it probably won't be super high on my personal request list.

RATING: 6
The 10 Days series of games are all similar in how they play.  The Africa map is one of our favorites.  We tend to gift the USA one to families with children as it helps them learn states.  But each is worth exploring.

RATING: 7
Played it with 2, 3 and 4 players. Only takes about 30 minutes to play and has you scratching your head to figure out a route. with 3 or 4 players it can be frustrating as tiles you want get discarded and  either picked up by another player or covered by more discards.

Considered to be easier than 10 Days in the USA because of the several countries with 2 tiles, and also the greater number of connections possible.  It's fun to learn the geography.  Super high quality tiles and racks.  The board is superior to the USA board because is has important game reminders.  Overall, this is better than (if a bit easier) than the USA game (which is also very good).  This is a less frustrating game than USA, especially for kids, although they probably need the USA version to learn their state capitals!  The Africa version also does not have the fiddly rules, such as AK and HI, etc.  Definitely like this better than the USA version.

The problem with the 10 Days series is how much the game is dependent on initial luck of the draw.  Of course, this requires some planning and strategy of placement, but more often than not, its the player who only needs one or two cards who can easily win.

I prefer the Africa and Asia versions over the Europe game (I know less about the geography and offers a greater variety of connections between countries).

We played this because we were heading to Africa in a few months. It has an interesting hand management system, in that you can't re-arrange your cards. So, you're picking up cards and putting them in certain places in your hand, with the idea that you'll link them all together in the future. "Well, after Kenya I'll need to visit a neighbour, so I'll put Egypt beside Kenya, so I can replace Egypt with Tanzania later..." Simple and fast, and hey, I was learning geography as I went.

Got the correct cards from the publisher [yay out of the box!] and have rocked and rolled this game..  if by rocking and rolling you mean got beaten by my hubbie but still had fun.

Pretty good geography lesson if you want to play with kids.  Otherwise, this is pretty dry as a game.

First play - 2 players - I got some lucky initial draws ans was able to win. This was my opponenets first "10 days in" game and my 7th overall. I enjoyed this one at least as much as the USA. The board wasn't as difficult to read as the Asia board. These are great games for what they are, simple fillers and gateway games for new players and kids.

The game play is almost identical to 10 Days in the USA. The bits are a little nicer looking. As an American, the map is less familiar, but that's part of the appeal.

RATING: 7.5
Light puzzle-ish game.  Great for learning geography.  Not much player interaction so with some rule tweaks i'm sure you could play it solitaire.  However I have no interest in such things and simply enjoy it for the light filler/gateway game that it is.  I prefer this to Asia as it is lighter and easier to teach and is also more forgiving because of the cars.

For a fast-paced (and typically quick in terms of time) game where your strategy needs to constantly adapt to changes in the available cardss, this is a great little game.

Apart from the possibility of the real political map changing, it would be nice just to learn where the african countries are.

I like the 10 Days series, although amusingly enough the USA version is my least favorite.  It's a nice, short little game that's easy to play, but has a bit of thinking involved.

Very similar to 10 Days in Asia, but with cars in place of boats.  The different geography and transport makes for a different game while remaining the same at the core.  I find this game more difficult because of my ignorance of African geography.  More reason to play the game.  I rate this the same as 10 Days in Asia.

simple and nice, but it can get sooo long , it can drag forever. and the map keeps getting older and older. i think it has also scarce replayability. Besides, it is also soooo dependent on luck. I was able to complete my journey at first turn !

Provisional rating after four plays.  Light filler, (and completely different from my regular fillers, For Sale and Royal Turf,) that may be a better fit as a "family" game.

Great family game, my son loves it.  Its a 10/10 for him.  This is a geographic - connection game about travelling in Africa, and it works brilliantly.  Don't expect any lions though, despite the box art.

I enjoy all of the games in the '10 Days in..." series. I would pull this one out for non-gamers because the challenge it poses is something most are familiar with in real life...route planning...which is an enjoyable excercise for many of us 'trip planners'.

The fact that it is taught in a minute and with few game components makes it something I like to have on hand for the gameing-wary. 

It is also an excellent geography-teaching tool for children who are able to read the names of places on cards and on the map. Map-boards are simple with only political boundaries, (no geographical features), which would have been atractive, but since winning the game is dependant on quickly coming up with a complete route, the fewer distractions on the map the better...expecially if playing with a map of unfamiliar regions. 

Certainly a 'filler' game, but it satisfies in a pinch.

RATING: 6
Best with two or three players.  With four, players are extremely limited in their choice of tiles (the one tile that you need to win is covered by another player's discard, etc.), which means that the game drags on for far too long.  A truism for this series is that quicker = better.

Great filler, and great to play with someone who doesn't profess to be a "gamer". This could easily be played by someone who's never played any other board game in their life. It's simple to teach, very quick, and has sturdy, nice components that make it eye-catching. This could be AWESOME for a geography teacher to use in an elementary or middle school class.

I love all the 10 Days in series and this one is no exception. It is fun, light, easy to teach, and easy to play.  It has great educational value and as a teacher I am always looking for games that can teach without being boring.

Good family game. The fourteen year old daughter went to Africa a few years ago for a visit and she really enjoys going back there, even though it's only in a boardgame.

Almost identical to 10 Days in the USA, but lack of familiarity with the geography of the region make each turn needlessly long.  Problem might be solved if played a dozen times.

Another good version of "geography Racko".  Mechanically the same as the USA map but with some double tiles which was nice.  We did find the poor color matching of the "beautiful" version to be pretty annoying though... so we'll probably primarily stick with USA and Europe when playing this... at least with my Mom.

More of the same.  The variation in automobile seem to make this version a lot easier in comparison to the others.  Not my first choice among the series.

After 5+ Plays: I like it a tad better than 10 Days in the USA, because it is helping me brush up on African geography.  Gamewise it is pretty much the same, though I do enjoy that a few of the bigger countries have two tiles.

Essentially a variation on the classic game of "Racko."  Select and discard tiles while working to establish an order of ten.  Not a bad game, just not a great game.

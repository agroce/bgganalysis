As long as you don't take this game too seriously it's a lot of fun. It's fiddley with the movement of the worms like any game where movement is important and done with imperfect human hands. Plays best with 5 people who aren't afraid of hurting one another's feelings by cutting each other off.

Played and liked. I even proposed it in outdoor game fairs using colored plastic cups for the worms and a &quot;Finish&quot; of cardboard fixed to a couple of plumber tools... I only don&#039;t know if playing with a strategy is always better than playing random. But I often win! ;-)

Fairly random and goofy, but a good time as long as you don't take it too seriously.  Some of the ways you can mess with other players is quite fun.  I think it requires at least 4 players.  5 players would probably work too.  After a long hiatus, we tried this again and it just feels completely random.  I'll finally get rid of it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
A very simple blind bidding/second guessing game. As you have so few cards to play, the actual bidding is very, very simple. However, instead of a score track you have worms to move across the table which means you can attempt to cut others off and block rather than go straight for the line.

A nice enough filler which, judging by the box, looks like it should have been in the Zock range.

I have Kameltreiber, a German version of Blazing Camels apparently which is apparently a version of Wurmeln. I haven&#039;t played it in years, and always thought it was so wonderfully beautifully cute and a great bar room game, but somehow we fonud the rules flawed enough to rob us of amusement after a while. I can&#039;t remember the flaws mind you, or if they were ours, so I should try it again some time ... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun light game with a similar game mechanism to Get Bit (I prefer this of the two).  I like the movement system, and the blocking it induces, as well as the possibility for the finish line to move around.  Solid fun, simple game that doesn't take too long.

Works just fine as a game I guess, but I'm really not a fan of "guess what everyone else is going to do" games.  It's even worse in this game, since you get to do absolutely nothing every time you guess the same as someone else.  Furthermore, we ran into one situation where someone couldn't move at all until another player got out of their way.

Worm Up is a fun game intended for children in which players bid for the right to move their worm.  Bids are secretly selected from amongst a set of tiles.  Each player has an identical set of five tiles.  Players who threw the same tile as any other player do not get to move their worm.  The worms are formed by buttons of wood.  They are moved by taking the last button and placing it in front.  This can be done at an angle, so it is possible to interfere with the paths of other worms.  The player whose worm is first to reach the finish line wins.

Players race a caravan of camels (or worms) across a table, taking the tail of the caravan and placing it back at the head.  You blind bid for movement, and cannot move if anybody bids the same amount.  Being the sole bidder of an "X" allows you to move the finishing line!  Fun, silly filler.

Racing game with a neat worm-moving mechanic.  You have to bid your move against other players, but if you match somebody else, you get nothing.  This can result in a player staying at the start line for the entire game.  Is that fun?   The other problem here is that after one play, you've seen it all - there's just no replay value here.  On the other hand, it's not at all expensive to buy.

I've never heard of Wurmeln, but mechanically it looks similar (but not identical) to Blazing Camels, which comprises 4 sets of 4 cute little pastel-shaded plastic camels, who you move nose to tail, by lifting the rearmost camel and placing it in front. The herds race from the start line, marked by two plastic palm trees, to the finish, designated by two pyramids. Movement is by bluffing with the "Berber" dice, only unique values counting. A simple, but cute and fun 10 minute game.

A different kind of racing game involving moving segments of your worm across a finish line first while trying to block your opponents. Even the finishing line can move in this game. Very fun, very short game that most would enjoy. Not much strategy, but perhaps just enough to keep it interesting.An extra copy of an earlier version of the game will get you two new colours you can use to broaden this out to 7 players, but optimal play is probably 4 or 5.

Super light children's racing game that still holds up and is fun.  You could certainly turn this into more of a fighting race game as you can twist and turn your worms to block each other as well as get into situations where you can even move the finish line around.  It's fun and for kids, certainly deserves a higher score than I would normally give it had it been marketed towards any other group of people.

The Worm Up version is especially thematic since the movement feels very wormy.  Still, self-destructive play is a little frustrating as it can lead to runaway victories.  But the game is quick enough that it doesn't really matter, and cutting your opponents off is a lot of fun.

An interesting premise for a children's game that fails on on a couple of different levels.

-- Rules are not clear how the X-tile works. It can be any value the player chooses, but when does the player make this choice?
-- Downtime is a major problem as you do not get to do anything unless you play a unique tile.

Lucky I am a good loser as I really lost this game well.

Fun racing game with the segments of the worms and their range of movement adding interesting elements to what would be, without them, a boring roll and move game. I, however, like the idea of those that were unable to move being able to put down an obstacle (a jenga piece has been suggested) as I spent a lot of time not moving and wishing I could be more involved in some way.

Worm Up! is a freestyle racing with a blind-bidding engine, which could be problematic for younger children, so don't be fooled by the artwork. The game is fine otherwise. You play it right when after fifteen minutes, the worms are still blocking each other at the start, while the finish-line gets further and further away.

Clever race filler where players play a card that determines how far their worm can move.  If someone else plays the same card then neither of you can move that round.  Moves are made as a chain where the bottom link moves to the front; you can try to block your opponents.  I like the tactile aspect of the race.  Stay away if you don't like silly guessing games.

Really neat. Very distinctive race game, good for kids and adults alike, and of course it's Randolph. There's a bit of a multi-player issue, in that - just for example - if you were playing against your wife and son, you might be kinda hosed from the get-go, which could reduce replayability.

A fun bidding and bluffing racing game.  The kids find this to be very tense, and it's a fun game where the adults can play with the children on a level playing field.

RATING: 7
Really quick and fun filler game. Trying to guess what your opponents are going to pick can be hilarious as multiple players often follow the same convoluted "logic" to arrive at a number. One of our regular players has even given up on this guessing game, preferring to simply randomly pick a number!

RATING: 5.5
La corsa dei vermi - Simpatico, si lascia giocare velocemente ridendo un po'. Dimenticatevi strategie e ragionamenti, anche i bluff e la psicologia non servono granché, lasciatevi divertire.

Gioco adatto ai più piccoli. Elementare sia da spiegare che da gicare.

[i]I ended up getting a copy of the game, but it wasn't a hit with my kids. I didn't pay much for it and ended up giving it to a friend to play with his daughter.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This was a very fun and potentially nasty racing/bluffing game. Think snake on Atari and it'll give you an idea how you can move your worm (which is mage up of 7 segments). I played this at a game night and ended up buying a copy that night since it's a game my 6 yo can play and one I think the whole family will enjoy. Definitely check it out if you have young kids.[/i]

Who would have thought there would be such a cool game in worm racing. Each worm is made up of 7 half-inch plastic shells that line up next to each other in a straight line on the table. No board or anything. Each player simultaneously reveals one of (3,4,5,6,7,X). Players who share the same number can’t move. Otherwise, if I’m to move 5 spaces, I pick up my last shell and place it next to my front shell, 5 times, either in a straight line, or bending around, or whichever which way, blocking off other worms, whatever. Even though the finish line starts straight ahead, selecting X allows you to not only choose any number no one else has, but also to shift the finish line - one end remains where it is, rotate the other end around it.

A bit of psychology, a bit of half-baked blocking, a bit of finsh-line-shifting. All the while watching these worms inch their way to the end. All over in 20 minutes or so. An excellent filler.

RATING: 5
Based one one play: This is really just a kids game. You select a tile (with numbers 4, 5, 6, 7 or X) and then if you chose a tile that no one else did you move your worm forward by placing a token from one end of the worm to another. First to the finish line wins. You cannot play the tile you just played and the X lets you play the lowest tile not used by anyone else. Since there are only 5 tiles and you can play anyone except the one you just played, it is pretty random and moving the worm gets dull fast. The more players, the more random it is. Young children may enjoy this, but as an adult, I would pass.

This game can be just silly and fun, but it can also be quite nasty. My daughter hated it as she kept playing the same card as her mother, handing me the win. The rules are simple, but the head games, the blocking and shifting of the goal make this game what it is. We just played it 3-player, but I can see how 4 or 5 players will make this game even more fun.

Simple little guessing game that is a fun to play when you are in the right mood. Can you pick what the others haven't? (Some times you are just as well off picking randomly) Then move your worm by moving from the end of the line to the beginning, cutting off your neighbors.

Simple little double-guessing race game. We have the '08 Worm Up! version, but looking at the pics here I'd rather have the Blazing Camels (especially for the cool dice!). You have to be a fan of the guess-what-they-are-thinking genre of games to enjoy this game. Fortunately, though, it plays fairly quickly (unless people keep playing the same tokens!).

--- Summary ---
Players line their worms up at the start line. Worms consist of 7 half-spheres touching each other. The finish line is ~2 feet away. Each player has a set of tokens labeled 4, 5, 6, 7, X; select and reveal one simultaneously. In order from low-->high, move your worm only if no one else played the same token as you, then set the successfully used token aside for one turn. Worms move by removing as many hemispheres from the back end as the number you played, and placing them in front (may curve if you like, to block other worms). The X is valued as any number that was not played. In addition, the player successfully playing the X may reposition the finish line: hold one end down, then rotate the other to wherever you like! The first worm to touch the finish line wins the race!

RATING: 6
One of the more unique racing games out there.  Fun to see the worms inching their way forward and some interesting decisions regarding which number to play.  A good game for mixing kids with adults and a good time for both.

Nice little game of luck and a very little bit of tactics. When we played, everybody enjoyed it, but nobody asked for a second round. A good & solid "6", cheap to buy or easy to make, probably interesting to play with children (if the bits are not too fiddly for them), easy to carry (it is very small) and quick to teach. Pretty good warm up game, indeed.

This is a kid's game that involves drawing one of your four tiles and trying to pick one that no one else has picked.  The tile you draw determines how many spaces you move.  If you match someone else's tile neither of you move.  There's not a lot of game here.

A kid's game at heart. This is a very light game of racing and some deduction. While it is a novel concept, especially with the worm movement and the constantly shifting goal line, this game is not complex or complicated enough even for younger kids. I would recommend this only for occasional play.

In this fun, goofy game, each player controls a worm formed from several lined-up discs. A turn consists of all players secretly choosing on their dice the amount that they want to move. When the choices are simultaneously revealed, all players who chose the same number as someone else lose their movement for that turn. All other players move their worms according to their dice, taking the appropriate number of discs from the back of the worms and adding them to the front, sometimes curving a bit in an attempt to cut off other worms' movement.

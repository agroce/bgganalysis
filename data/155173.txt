RATING: 6
My rating might be a bit unfair, as it is after one play only and I didn't get to play this until the end in Essen, only 2/3rds of it. But while this is without doubt quite playable and not even dull, it didn't excite me that much.

Too much solitare play for me to enjoy it much, I'm afraid.

A game that only has a puzzle sort of appeal with more potential for solo play. It wouldn't even be in my collection if I hadn't thought it was in any way associated with suburbia. There are a few similar mechanics but this game isn't even in the same league as suburbia.

The unfortunate aspect about abstract games, where you have difference scoring criteria based on patterns at the end of the game, is it often takes a game or two for everything to "click". But that's not what annoyed me. In the end, I found the randomness influential and the tile-drafting to be a mechanical-illusion that adds little to the decision process.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Not sure this one has enough to stay interesting.  There is very little to no interaction, as I don't know if it would ever be worth it to draft to block someone else when drafting.  There are also not enough unique building types to really keep it fresh.  I think the only variety this one is the starting map, and since there are only 2 variations, replayability is a bit concerning.  

I did have fun playing, and for the length of it, it is definitely something I would like to play again, but I was a bit disappointed in this one.

Terrific drafting game. I'd take this over 7 wonders any day, but 7 wonders is much more interactive (it's easier to tell what my neighbor needs). This is definitely a multiplayer solitaire game. Roads are a bit overpowered (no they aren't, I'm dumb). And I don't care. It's great, really wonderful game that I think just about anyone could get. I did have one player in my group struggle through most of the game though. (updated view: Quadropolis is better than this in almost every way. Game fired. This game is still good but the sorting required to play it with less than 4 is annoying)

A bit of a letdown after Suburbia to be honest. Fun in it's own right, but not as good as the cousin that everyone will compare it to.

I might end up regretting this purchase.  While I played the original Suburbia game and loved it, Subdivision is very different from its progenitor.  

I'll give it a few more play sessions in the future but it currently just feels like I'm playing a simultaneous game of solitaire, with minimal player interaction outside of passing my hand of tiles.

Interestingly puzzle-y, with some very neat spatial dynamics, but scoring felt dominated by highway adjacencies (or lack thereof), and interactivity felt fairly light.

Perhaps with more experience, the draft is more critical and hate-drafting becomes more relevant, but I'm not especially inspired to make that journey.

Components: Simple, functional graphics. I like the level of detail on the tiles. The colored symbols on the board, though easy to reference, could have been something more thematic to indicate why certain areas are so important to pave over.

Experience: Difficult to plan ahead, and think of how to efficiently activate tiles, but interesting and fun. There are lots of ways to play out my hand, and lots of ways to score points. Providing road access to zones seems super powerful.

This was a huge disappointment. There is very little to do and even less strategy. This can all be somewhat salvaged if the game is at least fun but it is incredibly dry and boring. Bezier games created my top 2 rated games in over 200 played but they really dropped the ball here. A 6 is probably kind.

I absolutely love city building games. Suburbia is one of my favorites, so I had really high hopes for this game. Sadly, I  was very disappointed. The mechanism in the game are just too complex, the scoring doesn't make sense, the rules not clear, and my wife hates it - the only thing she liked was the cool die.  This one just falls short on too many levels to like.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
not a bad game. It has some likeness to suburbia. But is a solitaire game. It is all about fitting tiles down like placing puzzle pieces trying to score points by matching different types of tiles beside each other. I would play this again. But it's not one of my favorites.

In spite the efforts of the person demoing it in Essen this game is boring to death and does not reference at all the success from Suburbia. It's the loneliest game I've ever played (and I'm not a huge fan of direct interaction) but this one takes the loneliness to a whole new level. I'm glad I tested it before playing so it could be my first and last game.

I played this at Origins (2014) and really enjoyed it. This is a quick game that only has 4 rounds. You balance the placement of new tiles over negative spots (rolled for by die) with activating previously placed tiles to grow your subdivision to it's full potential. 

I lost miserably the first time I played (didn't quite get it in the din of Origins). The second time I built on less of the board, focusing on strategic placement, and won (close game)!

This is definitely going in my library when it comes out at GenCon.

Feels like a zoomed-in version of the more popular game "Suburbia", but has a lot more going on than it seems. Partly due to simple rules, partly due to a streamlined gameplay it feels different but also familiar at the same time, if you already know the big predecessor. I like it quite a lot! It is balanced, not to long, and the components are great. Fans of city building games should try it, all others as well.

Interesante puzzle, con una mecánica ágil que hace que el azar esté bastante controlado y haya lugar a decisiones interesantes. La principal pega es que resulta muy solitario y que la rejugabilidad es limitada: las partidas tienden a parecerse ya que hay que "cumplir" ciertos mínimos para tener opciones de victoria.

I liked Subdivision a lot, but after ten plays, the lack of replay value showed a bit.  I probably would have kept it, but I have a lot of really excellent tile laying games in my collection, so it was never hitting the table.

[b]previous comments:[/b]
Subdivision is a really fun game that I think suffers from comparisons to its much-deeper older sibling Suburbia.  When taken for what it is, a light, fast, interesting puzzle game with minimal player interaction, I think subdivision is a really fun time.  Compared to other drafting games, such as 7 wonders, it fits into that niche very well - light enough to be accessible to new players, tight enough that the scoring won't feel like a blowout, and constricted enough that it has some interesting decisions.  I really enjoy the road access constraint, because it turns what would otherwise be a too-simple puzzle, and gives you some opportunity to balance points lost now for the points you could gain later when you activate the tiles that are blocking your access.

I played the crap out of this game when I first got it, and definitely find it engaging enough to pull out again whenever anybody expresses interest in a play.  For 45 minutes, it's a good time.

RATING: 7
This looks very much like it is going to play as [thing=123260][/thing]-the dice game but actually it is very different and I do quite like it. 

There is a tile drafting mechanic and each turn a die is rolled to tell you what sort of terrain you can build upon this turn, of course you can pay to ignore that requirement and build where you like.

Tiles only activate when another tile (white bordered) is placed next to it but it is the black bordered tiles that gain you victory points/money amongst other things, so you must balance between the two. 

Each white bordered tile does something very different and you really need to acquire them all in balance.

2015-07-01 - First impression: This is like Suburbia's baby. It vastly simplifies the sort of mathy, fiddly nature of Suburbia, but gives a similar feel in the way the tile laying works. It's a drafting game, too, but the drafting isn't quite as satisfying as in a game like 7 Wonders, because there are only a few types of tiles that can make up your hand.

2017-11-06 - I ended up selling this because I just didn't find the choices very interesting. Quadropolis scratches this itch for me in a much more satisfying way.

RATING: 7
Subdivision will be inevitably be held back by comparisons to Suburbia, but it stands as an enjoyable game on its own. It is more tactical than strategic, and the game gives you enough flexibility to mitigate the randomness of the die roll and drawing/passing tiles. There isn't quite enough meat here for a main course, but a solid option for a quick, light gateway or filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A die roll tells you which areas of the map are eligible for one of the sixteen tiles you place down -- activating the power of the tile(s) next to it to add parks, lakes, roads and other point-giving tiles only available this way. The big catch is that you pass tiles between placement, and you have no idea what bonuses may be given before the 2nd, 3rd and 4th stacks are dealt out. It's a simpler version of Castles Of Burgundy with the Suburbia concept, with much a more complicated scoring system.

PLUS: easy to learn game play, mixture of concepts/themes
MINUS: Suburbia components are there but not the same level of strategy/interaction

solitairy puzzle drafting. Some good ideas, but unfortunatly very Feld-y. You get points for every damn thing you do, so games will always be close without it feeling like you accomplished anything great. One round to long, would probably be better if it was only 3 rounds, since the game feels finished at that point. Also, like Among the Stars, suffers from the lack of escalation from round 1 to 4.

Subdivision takes elements from Suburbia and adds a 7 Wonders draft. Drafted tiles are placed on the board, their effects are resolved and possibly other tiles are activated again. So far this is known from Suburbia.

There are less unique tiles than in Suburbia and its not as deep. Unluckily, it's still not a light game. Remembering and correctly executing all the implications of a tile placement is not trivial. This puts Subdivision into an uncomfortable in-between position. With gamers, I rather play Suburbia. If I want something lighter and quicker, I rather go with something with less administrative overhead and easier explanations. I also dislike that individual mistakes are almost impossible to track. Too much ado about not enough.

The decisions in Suburbia, while not trivial, are generally about the immediate effects of the tile you're placing.

Subdivision, on the other hand, is about indirect effects -- either the properties of tiles that you're about to place a new tile adjacent to, or the properties of the tile you're selecting that won't come into play until later turns. Placement location is even more important than in Suburbia, but it's also heavily constrained (roll a die, place only on a space of the color rolled or pay money to overrule). The end result is that I'm confused most of the time I'm playing, and my regular group will never get through a game without hating me for foisting it on them.

Also, I'm not really a fan of how one scoring category (road access) dominates all others in terms of possible points.

Not enough variability in tiles and ways to score, so you pretty much have to do the same thing in every game to stay competitive.  Castles of Mad King Ludwig is the game Subdivision should have been and scratches the same itches while being superior in pretty much every way.  Unless Subdivision gets a sizable expansion, I think it's unlikely I'll ever play it again.  I've never previously had a game that was so easily and completely replaced by another before, but Castles does that to Subdivision.

You cannot approach this game thinking that it's going to be Suburbia ver 2.0. I would say that the two games have nothing in common other than the theme and art style...and the fact that they are both tile-laying games. Other than those general things, they are COMPLETELY different and it's nice to have them be completely different because they are both good on their own merits. 

The quick-playing and puzzle-y Subdivision is both strategic and tactical and shines as a quick thinky filler. Subdivision is perfect for when you have plenty of brain power but are short on time. The puzzle-y nature of it also makes it highly addictive. My goal in life is to reach Master Builder status!

This game is definitely Suburbia's little sibling, using a similar concept, while managing to be a vastly different experience. This is essentially a drafting game with tableau building. You are trying to fill out your own board, covering up as many plots of land as you can manage, trying to activate buildings as well keeping them connected to the main road.

If someone thinks there was too much to keep track of in Suburbia (because of how all the tiles could potentially affect other players), but like the idea of it, this could very well be their game as in this game you are more focused on what you do and not so much on what your opponent does. I enjoy them both and this is definitely a good simpler game to bring out if I don't have the time or brain capacity to take on Suburbia that day.

Not interested. Was tricked by the neat microbadges that suggested a similar iconography and synergies as in Suburbia (what is wrong with me?). It turns out, however, that it is a much more gamey tile placement and covering game. I particularly detest the "you may now place something in this diagonal" and the strange sidewalks.

When Suburbia has a bigger variety, Subdivision has less types of tiles but more planning-ahead. Scoring was a bit onedimensional. A pretty fun alternative overall, but I still prefer Suburbia.

Turns out drafting only five unique things isn't quite that interesting. And dice ruling your placement makes it even less interesting. As I got stomped on, I can attest that experience does play in this game, but it was not very compelling to me.

First game (2p with us doing a couple of rules wrong) was fun and easy but low scores. Second (3p) was tougher and taught me the difficulty of minding road access, the power of sidewalks, and being thoughtful pointing your Lake and Park activators for future coverage. 

I also just read a bunch of comments and the designer's thoughts on how critical road access is to the game. I think it should be more prominently mentioned in the rules so you realize it's a bad idea to isolate zones. I get that intellectually but you discover the power of it only during scoring. Huge impact.

Nice little puzzle game - very solitaire-ish, even with multiple players, but at least there's a bit of draft. But I like solitaire puzzles, and this seems interesting. The bonus tiles give some variability, and there are also scenarios.

I liked it a lot more than what I was expecting!

It's a very very interesting and different tile drafting and laying game, you get the scent of Suburbia, I like Suburbia but I don't love it (I prefer my more than a mile The Capitals), but of course, much much more streamlined.

But the simplicity and quickness of this game makes it great... and it will play the same with any number of players because it's all done in simultaneous and therefor the amount of time doesn't increase.

I just felt that the Sidewalks were a bit to easy to score, we all got maximum points from them, everything else was pretty interesting.

You’re a developer hoping to win the contact to build on a large track of land that has been annexed by the local government. Only the most valuable design for the subdivision will be successful, so optimize your use of each of the parcels allocated, balance your zoning and improvements, and ensure that all zones in the community have access to the local highway.

A family game of competitive city building via tile placement.

I thought I would like this one a bit more than I did. It's true that it's very solitaire-ish, but there is a little bit of hate-drafting going on. Unfortunately, there are also so few tiles that it's difficult to keep someone from ever getting one type. I feel like going for roads and parks is the way to win, as schools usually aren't worth the hassle, and sidewalks only score you a maximum of 20 points. In many ways, this just felt like an inferior version of Patchwork, with a much fiddlier setup. I thought this game was fine for what it was, but ultimately not something I felt like I needed to play again.

Solitaire tile puzzle through an unexciting tile draft. Works if you like grid-filling puzzles in the vein of Take It Easy or Rolling Japan. 

Very bland looks but luckily there are not any icons to recognize, it's just tiles of nine different colors. The interconnections are straightforward enough so that turns stay relatively simple. The game is harmless enough for one try but I have no need to ever play this again.

[i]After about 6 plays things started to feel samey, by the tenth play my son and I were done with it. There just isn't enough variety in the tiles to give this game similar life to it's far distant cousin Suburbia. If a game of this play time and weight isn't going to get a lot of play it's not sticking around in my collection so it got sold. I would consider revisiting it if an expansion came out that breathed some new life into the game.[/i]

[i]- A great combination of tile drafting and the spacial puzzle of deciding where to place your tiles.
- The aesthetic tie in with Suburbia [i](and that's where it ends, this game is nothing like Suburbia)[/i].
- This game manages to pack in a lot of variety in strategies with limited tile choices [i](5 zoning tiles that each produce a different improvement tile)[/i].

Funnily enough, it reminds me of Take It Easy - you start with a plan of how you'd like to place your tiles so as score decent points at end-game. If you get a tile and a placement choice that fits the plan each turn, great. If you don't, then the decision arrives on how to minimise damage, and how to make the best of what's available. Subdivision has more complicated scoring rules however, so the decisions are harder, as befitting a game with commensurately more length. I think its rating probably suffers as it doesn't fit the expectations bill when compared to its sister game Suburbia, but I suspect it has a different place in a collection and I think it's pretty decent as a standalone light tableau-placement-planner game.

after one two player game: nice medium game, perhaps for those that dislike drafting might not be found of it, or the dice rolling, but the luck factor can be quite mitigated, and we followed different paths, at the end only 3 points of difference. In my opinion it can not be compared to suburbia... yes it is a city building game, the same publisher and artwork, but a different target, not as heavy as suburbia, but has enough dept and challenge, at the end I like them both.
I give it 8 easily.

Subdivision is a light city-building game that revolves around a closed draft, like 7 Wonders.  Each turn, a communal die is rolled, and players must choose one tile to place on a hex corresponding to the die roll on their city board.  These hexes cover up negatives on the city board, and when another tile is placed next to one of them, it can activate, which allows players to place bonus tiles (bonus tiles don't activate other tiles) or grant other abilities.  Naturally, there's a number of different ways to score points, based on the proximity of various tiles and the such, minus negatives taken for unfilled spaces.  I enjoyed this as a short/filler game, it provided with plenty of opportunities to plan out what I want my city to look like at the end, and constantly adjust my strategies based on what tiles are available and what is rolled.  Good fun.

RATING: 6
The game plays so much faster than Suburbia, and replaces the marketplace with drafting, and far simpler tile interactions, and placement activated tiles in a way presumably reminiscent of Glen More.

My biggest issue with this game is its really tacked on Suburbia theming. The game is good, no question, but they want to build Suburbia as a brand which feels like nonsense to me. Making this game for direct comparison with Suburbia is silly because they're VERY different, and honestly this game is far more Euro, with the limited but significant randomness of the tiles drawn and the dice rolls reminding me of Settlers, which to me are the worst parts of the game.

Suburbia is a horse of a different color, for certain, and each game fills a different niche (I'd say this game is Suburbia by way of Among the Stars), and I'm not sure which I like more. Suburbia has more flavor, but Subdivision feels far more mechanically tight.

1 play, 2er

This is sort of like Take It Easy, set in the world of Suburbia, with drafting.

Each player has their own board. Each round starts by giving each player a hand of ZONE tiles (in the usual Suburbia styles). Each turn, roll a die; players must place one of their tiles in one of the spaces on the board matching the symbol rolled on the die. All adjacent zones may be activated for various abilities (e.g., place sidewalk pieces, earn money, place IMPROVEMENT tiles, etc.). Then, pass the remaining tiles and repeat turns until each player has placed 4 (of 5) tiles. Repeat that whole round sequence until all tiles in the game have been placed.

Scoring is based on several things:
+ points for tiles adjacent to park
+ (# of zone types adjacent to sidewalk) x (# of improvement types adjacent to that sidewalk)
+ points for schools
+ 5 points per zone tile with access to pictured highway, via empty hexes or road tiles
+ points for leftover money
- points for empty board spaces (-1 to -3)

Most points wins!

The game works, I suppose, but it's not my kind of thing: way too puzzle-y! It's nice that the player boards are double-sided, with alternate layouts. Also, there are several scenarios, with alternate starting setups, that should add to the game's replayability. Of course, the drafting already kind of does that.

So, a good game but not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Despite its appearance, aside from the graphic design, name, and publisher this game has little in common with Suburbia.  This game has the theme of zoning an undeveloped area for industry, residential, etc.  Gameplay-wise it is a strict abstract game though.  Each turn players roll a die and place one of a handful of tiles on their board.  When placing a tile you activate all the other tiles surrounding it which typically places other tiles on the board and score in different ways at game end.  The tile selection is a draft as after each round you pass the tiles and select from a new hand of tiles.

I should really dislike this game.  It has so many features that I really dislike in games.  I'm not a fan of overly abstract games, this is exactly that.  I'm also really not a fan of solo experiences in board games, also something this game definitely is.  But, I don't dislike this game.  It definitely has that unexplainable charm that a lot of games do, but past that I can't explain it.  I have just enjoyed my plays of this game.

It is certainly simple which makes it accessible to most everybody and it plays quickly.  There is definitely depth to it as you decide not only which tiles to draft and where to place them but also how to set up activations to get the most out of your design.

I will say the drafting in this game is a little weak.  There are only 5 different kinds of zoning tiles and most of the time you are placing tiles to activate already placed tiles so your selections aren't always that difficult or meaningful.

Competent multiplayer-solitaire puzzle: someone rolls a die indicating the colour that must be built on, players choose a tile from in hand, place it and pass the rest on. Placed tiles activate adjacent ones (a la Glen More). Most points wins.

Like Suburbia before it, I rather suspect that this one is best as a solo game: other players add almost nothing besides downtime. There's too much luck for my taste, but other less gamer-y players struggled with the complexity; I wouldn't want to play it with either non-gamers or the hardcore.

Again this Bezier title is very well developed! The rules are very straight forward and short and the game plays fast and still has strategy and tactical elements to give it enough depth. I guess these are the characteristics of the games we can expect from Bezier in the future. And that's not a bad thing.
Let's get this out of the way: this is mostly multiplayer solitaire. In essence it's the drafting from [thing=68448][/thing] with the tile laying from [thing=123260][/thing]. It's not as deep or as fulfilling as that last title, but it certainly is fun.
One annoying thing is: the grid on the board is slightly smaller than the tiles you have to fit on them so you're constantly adjusting the tiles to fit as best as possible. I guess that's what you get when you print in China...

This game (unlike Suburbia) does not really offer up many divergent strategies and is essentially a solitaire puzzle albeit an enjoyable one. The drafting mechanic is clearly meant to push each player into a different strategy but in the end just doing a bit of everything works well and minimizes the risk of you not getting the tiles you need. You have to have a good eye for forward planning too as towards the end of the game space is limited and its important to place things properly to maximise points. All in all this was very easy to learn despite a somewhat awkward rule book at times, and a enjoyable quick lightweight game, but ultimately it does not provide the city building satisfaction its big brother Suburbia does.

I think the worst thing about this game is that people are going to expect it to be on the level of Suburbia, when it's a completely different game.  It's lighter, but not without its choices to make, and that's not to say that it's a light game.  I'd consider it medium-weight, given all the different aspects to the game.  I like the city-building style of the game, and I can see that it would be ripe for expansions, specifically with different player boards.  The game feels somewhat limited due to there only being five tile types up for draft, but overall, I liked the game.

Preordered for pick up at GenCon '14. Love suburbia and from preview looked like a unique experience...drafting tiles and activating adjacent structures...played in hotel at Indy...So disappointed. Hopes too high...yep. Played again several times...it is a solo game, drafting does little to create player interaction...keep thinking there is a better way to increase player interaction...maybe making each tile have an optional activation: do the primary action (from the rules) or another one that affects the other player...but I don't have time to make this a better game. I'll just go play a good one we have.

Tile placement city development sim. This is like a micro planning version of suburbia. Players develop their own hex parcel maps with differenct zone tiles (residential, commercial, etc.) that activate adjacent tiles when played to build roads, lakes, sidewalks or schools towards end game bonus scoring. I like the draft system passing your unplayed tiles each round and simultaneous play keeps things moving. Deciciding between alternatives quickly gets frustrating in a good way.

Nice puzzle game. No player interaction. Some luck with the placement die but even that can be mitigated. Attractive tiles.

It's not too heavy, but it is really interesting. In my few plays, I've seen a variety of strategies take the win. This and the drafting element helps it have a fluid feel, and the quick play time is really nice too!

Just buy Suburbia.  Scratches the same itch and suburbia is vastly superior.

GAME: Eggs of Ostrich
RANK: 4427
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
An fast enjoyable game combining bluffing and deduction.  Entire game consists of 10 choices from a set of 5 bid options, with a one-turn delay in the recovery of your bid (so each turn excepting the first, you choose from 4 possible bids).

The one-turn delay in the recovery of your bid card adds depth, as you find yourself thinking through the next hand when choosing this hand's bid, but that presumes your opponents aren't doing the same to out-maneouver you! Consideration of your opponents' current positions, however, can lead to high likelihood of guessing their current bid choices.  

The 'skip' option can be used aggressively to thwart opponents, but not having it available for the following hand risks missing out on important 'amber' points. 

As suitable for 8+ as much as the recommended 12+ (knowledge of simple division helps).  Three-player only, but there's a spot on our shelf for that.

RATING: 5
1st play: Essentially a micro game.  Better than Love Letter, entertaining Princess Bride moments.  Trying to determine when other people will go for the eggs vs try to make you bust - a bit unpredictable but fun to play while waiting for more to arrive.

RATING: 6
Fun bluffing game, but lots of luck. And the "skip" card and gold egg thing is irrelevant too often.

RATING: 8
I'm often playing with three, so a three player only game is not a problem. Like many games of this genre, EoO has been reduced to a simple mechanism and clever scoring which enhance the theory of mind aspect at the centre of the game.

RATING: 8
3 player only wonky game with some push your luck mixed in. Success in this game is all about double guessing your opponents. Play your Pass card when there is a high number of eggs out there and watch the other 2 players curse at you in frustration as their baskets break. Fun stuff. Another big hit with my neighborhood Euchre group. We played 3 games in a row of this one night.

RATING: 7
The fun to time ratio for this game is excellent! It's a 10 minute clever party game that is also good with non-gamers. About the only negative is that it only plays with three, but then it wouldn't be what it is.

RATING: 4
I like these ideas: messing with other players by choosing skip; feeling pressure to keep your skip card in case of an amber; leaving two cards out of the deck; high interaction; short playtime; simple rules. But the game doesn't reliably maintain tactical or endgame tension: if other players make you break your "7" bag on an early turn, for example, you might have no choice but to keep breaking your other bags. It's fun when other people break your bags! It's not necessarily fun to keep playing after that.

RATING: 7
Eggs of Ostrich is an oh-so-simple but oddly addictive 3 player card game. Another Japanese hit. You are collecting eggs. Turn a card over to determine how many eggs are up for grabs for the three of you. Now simply play a card to say which capacity bag you want to put your share of the eggs in. Easy. But there are two extra elements: a 'skip' card to skip the round and so your fellow players will get more eggs each and potentially burst their egg bag, so great opportunities to screw your opponents. And the clever clever bit, the card you play is not available to you next round. 

This game is like a first class simple Knizia game. And it plays in 10 minutes.

RATING: 4
A fun 3 player, with unfortunately creepy graphics (can an ostrich lay on its back, legs akimbo? Don't answer that, please!)

The scoring makes you risk losing everything as you score near nothing for anything less than a full bag.

Once you start losing bags your options fall away precipitously.

3 Player-only limits how much this gets to the table but it's a great opener or closer.  I love simultaneous selection/reveal games and that mechanic along with the small hand size make for a super-fast, stripped down showdown.

Probably the best game about ostriches that I've ever played. I admire that the game was made for only three players - there should be more of those. A fun, unusual theme and a really quick play time is a good combination.

RATING: 7
Fine filler addition to the three player only category. Plays quick, but still requires some outguessing skills from the players. Ambers are make or break for many, I guess. I like that extra concept of outguessing. Eggs are really nice.

Fun and easy to learn filler for exact three players. Offers enough decisions and also luck. After more games I've to raise my rating (6 -> 7); it's that fun AND it's that fast.

Played this in line for the 2013 BGG.Con.  A wagering game where you try to get as many ostrich eggs as your sacks can hold.  If they go over their allotted number they break and you lose that bag.  Whoever has the most eggs at the end wins.

There is an odd image of an ostrich on a handful of the cards but other than that a pretty fun little came.

I suspect that with three players who knew what they were about and had a few plays under their belt, this might make an interesting affair.

But how often is all that going to happen, really?

I can't work out whether the ostrich art is innocent or deliberately perverse (this is the Japanese we're talking about, after all). Opinions welcomed.

Very nice quick filler.  I am usually not a fan of simultaneous selection games, but with the short game length as well as the tight decision space, this works.

[i]Eggs of Ostrich is quite fun for a quick five minute game. The concept is very simple, but there is enough room to screw with your opponents and get in their heads. I'd play again, but I rarely find myself looking to play such a short game. In fact my only complaint is I would like to play a longer game using these mechanics.[/i]

A great piece of design as a 3-person micro-filler. There's a bit more to the gameplay than meets the eye too as you come to learn the pacing of the game and don't quite play just hand-to-hand. Still very simple and a good laugh, though.

A quick, easy, read-your-opponent game for eggsactly three players (yeah, sorry), with art so bad it's enjoyable. Not convinced about longevity, but one game I played saw two experienced gamers win by a sizeable margin from a novice, so evidently there is something to learn in the interactions and tactics.

1 play, 3er

This is yet another one of those little Japanese games: simple rules, quick game play, interesting decisions. It's a guess-what-everyone-else-is-going-to-do game, so I'll never be any good at it, but it was still fun! 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each player has the same set of cards: 2, 3, 5, 7, with matching egg basket cards (placed on table), plus a Skip. Shuffle the deck of cards (4-10, amber x 3) and remove 2 from game (unseen). Each round, reveal the top card (= one amber. or the total number of eggs available). Then, players simultaneously choose one of their cards (any except the one they used last turn). Eggs: all players revealing a number card divide eggs as evenly as possible, and place them in the basket of the same number; if too many eggs in basket (more than basket number), lose all those eggs and that basket! If Amber was revealed, an amber is awarded if only ONE player played Skip, to that player. 

Play through deck. Full baskets are worth their value, while incomplete baskets each score 1 VP per pair of eggs in them. Each amber is worth 4 VP. Most VP wins.

RATING: 8.3
A fairly random but largely entertaining game where you're choosing either to share in the points or allow others to take all of them, resulting in them 'busting' and losing points. Which is of course, hilarious.

Fun for the 5 minutes it takes, but really there's not a lot here.

Update: Okay, I've played this a lot now and it has grown from 'pointless filler that I'll grudgingly play' to 'absolute delight that is always welcome'. It's brilliantly simple yet wonderfully dicky.

Rating up from 6.4 to 7 and then up again to 8.3.

RATING: 8
I'd never heard of this game before and it looked a lot like a kid's game, so I was a bit nervous trying it. It's a three player only game which is also a bit unusual.

You start the game with 4 bags numbered 2, 3, 5 and 7. Every round an egg card is flipped over showing how many eggs will be divvied up. You have a card for each of your bags and a skip card. You play the card for which bag you want to put your share of the eggs in. But be careful because if you get too many eggs, the bag breaks and you lose them all. The card you played stays out for the next round making it unavailable for a round.

There are a few special egg cards, in particular one which only has amber on it and no eggs. Amber can't be put in a bag, and can only be taken by the player who plays a skip card when no one else plays a skip card. It's worth 4 points which is quite juicy. The eggs in your bags are worth 1 point at the end of the game, unless you've completely filled your bag in which case they're worth two each.

This is a evil game where you're trying to out-think your opponents, and there's a fair bit of "...but he knows that I know that he knows..." I really enjoyed this game. It's a very hefty game considering how quickly it plays.

A clever, ultimately light and very short game of double-guessing your opponents' intentions. Delightful and I suspect a good choice for non-gamers. My first few plays were a blast, though I do wonder about replayability. Then again, how much expectation can you place on a 10-15 minute game.

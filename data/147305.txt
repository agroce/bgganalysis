Delightful little filler game with simple mechanics and charming components. I've had a blast playing this and would love to own a copy as I think it will really work in non-gamer family situations. My group of light gamers loved it!

I put off buying this because I don't like the art and the hedgehog on the front is really creepy!  But the game has been a huge hit with family and games club.  Play a round to teach the game and then dive in.  Young players can hold their own here.

Nagyon egyszerű játék, kb. Love Letter szint. Sokat elárul róla, hogy akár random játékkal is meg lehet nyerni:) Tehát nem kell komolyra számítani, kisgyerekekkel is játszható. Mégis úgy érzem, van benne eredeti ötlet, felnőtteknek is tök jó  partijáték. Egy menetben összesen 6 lapot játszunk ki, szóval 5 perc az egész:) Tölteléknek tök jó:)

A sweet game of blind bidding on various food chains. If you bid correctly, the predator you played is the only one of its kind, and subsequently eats all the prey, including prey cards played by the players. A game lasts for 3 rounds, and prior to every round the board is seeded with prey in the form of cute d6's. Then the players play one predator card per turn, eating whatever they are allowed by the rules; and finally count up the total number of dice and cards they caught. (The prey furthest down on the food chain counts for 2 VP per die instead of 1 VP.)

The idea is good, and the execution too... were it not for the fact that unintended clashes between played cards literally halves your intended VP value; and that [i]un[/i]intended victories can lead to unsurmountable leads which are nigh impossible to catch up to simply because there isn't enough game material to add up to the proper VP-delta. This chaotic effect will become more and more pronounced as the number of players increases; and even though the game is advertised as being playable with 5 and even 6 players, I'd stay well below those numbers. 

As a rule of thumb I like games with blind bidding, but in Om Nom Nom their effect can be too devastating, which is why I won't go out of my way to play the game anew unless some rules are instated to dampen the chaotic effect.

Om Nom Nom is pretty weak. Let's not beat around the bush here. A game of Paper Scissors Stone bluffing that looks OK but in play is just not interesting. The animal theme means that with young kids this would work, and I can see 4 yrs+ playing this excitedly, but I cannot think of anything else positive to say about it. There are many better bluffing games around that is for sure.

As a solitaire game, I would rate it a 3 or so, but it is obviously better against actual human players which you can outwit. Solitaire it is a somewhat boring luckfest. With four players it works well, and I enjoyed my plays.

This is a game whee players try to outwit each other.  There is simultaneous selection of actions which may cause some players to lose their chances.  It is short, simple, and surprisingly fun.  

Players choose from 6 cards in three different food chains, and they can eat the level below them.  There are some plants at the bottom of each food chain that are not associated with any of the player cards but can be eaten by the lower cards.  Players try to collect the most points by eating the dice or other players cards.  As mentioned, quite simple but also fun.

Gioco di carte, predatori contro prede. L'obiettivo del gioco è prendere quante più prede queste saranno punti vittoria. Il gioco mi ricorda molto Jungle Brunch uscito un anno prima. Rispetto al suo precursore in questo gioco diminuisce il caso (un po') ed aumenta un po' l'intuito.

An ok game that looked better on paper than is does on the table. Main issue come across in both games played so far is that after the first couple of rounds, most if not all the dice have gone, thus just leaving everyone playing obvious choices (play your highest ranked card). Thus the game goes flat.

Really did need more dice at the start of the game... Or a limit to how many you can pick up in a turn.

2 player is just dull. Does get better with added player count.

This is one of those chaotic simultaneous action selection games. If you choose the option no one else chooses, you can score really big. So it's a lot of I think that you think that I think... I didn't mind it but yeah, not one of my favorite games or mechanisms.

This is a simultaneous placement game where you're trying to out-think the other players. Parts of it are deterministic, but it's not bad. The title, though, suggests this is going to be a cute game of eating cupcakes, while the theme is actually about predators and prey in the food chain.

Cute idea, great art, but way too expensive for what it is. Other games have done the predict-which-card-the-other-will-play, and during our second game all the dice were picked up so quickly that we were left with three rounds of just playing the cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a very fun push-your-luck game for kids, casual gamers, and family game nights. It plays on three boards, one where the hedgehog is the top predator, eating frogs, which eat flies in their turn. On another the cat is the top predator, eating mice, who in their turn try to steal cheese. The last board feature wolves who eat rabbits who eat carrots.

Dice with the above food and animal icons, but without the top predators, are rolled and put in the various spots on the boards. Then each player takes his six playing cards, showing the three top predators, and the smaller ones, and everyone plays a card at the same time, and then resolving the results.

If you play a rabbit, while I played a wolf, then I eat your rabbit. However, had I also played a rabbit we would've both shared the carrots instead.

The game is played in 3 rounds, and in each round the players must play all of their 6 cards. It's quick and highly entertaining.

Figures are cool, but wizards was lazy on the gameplay.  D&D combat rules.  So basicly an rpg with no story.

Wonderful miniatures strategy game.  With the number of sets that are out now there are lots of options for building your squads.  Pleanty of variable setup and victory condition options.  Strategic enough to stay engaging, but simple enough to learn in a short time.

One smart design!  You draft your armies and go at it.  They have powers and abilities, attack, defense, damage dealt, and life points.  I had Darth Vadar and a bunch of Storm Troopers in my game and I was impressed at how useless the stormtroopers were (just like Episodes I-III) and what a bad@ss Vadar was!  He pretty much single-handedly destroyed Leah, 2 wookies, R2D2, and a group of rebel commandos by himself.  You shoot at him from afar, and he bounces your attack right back at you.  If you get lucky and hit him,  his armor deflects some, and if you attack him up close, he spins and jacks you up.  Up close, he's just wicked with that light saber and from afar, he's choking you with the force.  All too easy.

(Note: it made for a horribly unbalanced game.  Don't bring Vadar or, if you insist, bring some Jedi along for the fight.  I suppose that's why Qui Gonn told Amidala, "We'll handle this." (meaning he and Obi Wan) and why it takes two Jedi to fight a Sith.) 

From a design standpoint, this took [thing=3284][/thing], removed the dumb parts (Han and Chewie can shoot Vadar and kill him ... really?), and left you with Star Wars [thing=11170]Heroscape[/thing], but while it's not as cool as Heroscape, it's pretty darned cool, and Heroscape could never fit Star Wars as well into its system (based on how they butchered the super heroes).

CMG ...gotta catch them all! Well... not quite, as I will concentrate on miniatures from the classic Star Wars Saga.

I'll be using these miniatures for different tabletop skirmish rule systems. For this reason I can't really rate the game as I won't use the rules included with the miniatures.

I can rate on the miniatures themselves though. I'd give the sculpts a [b]7[/b] and the paintjobs a [b]6[/b]. But yet I'd give the miniatures an [b]8[/b] overall, based on that they're [b]Star Wars[/b] and decently priced on Ebay. 

I'll probably do some touch-up brush work on the miniatures whenever I get the time... But the prepainted miniatures already look fair on a long outstretched arms length, and it's nice that painting them isn't in a hurry.

*I don't care about broken sabers or bent/damaged figures.
*I don't want vehicles unless bulk requirement is met first or they are part of the bulk offer. Vehicles count as 10 minis.
*I especially don't care about rarity as i am not a collector but i don't want 100% commons either as i can use characters for who they are.
*I also plan on painting them to suit my npc's and pc's.

An old game that has intersting rules, but not without more expansions, which sadly arent' around. 

Wasn't the worst game, really, and had some clever ideas, but only if they'd gone ahead and extended it with more scenarios and characters.

It's a dead end now.

We've got the Clone Wars starter and some additional minis.

Gameplay very similar to the D&D Miniatures game.

Simple and elegant on the surface promoting fast play but with plenty of depth through special abilities and potential combos to engage older players.

Using the force to knock down multiple 'baddies' in one go - what's not to love?! :)

The game is more eye candy than deep strategy.  But having said that, my Star Wars addicted nephews love playing it.  Game mechanics are very straightforward with all combat resolved by a d20.  Youngsters who do basic addition can play the game fairly well.  Like Card Collecting games, the rarest, most powerful characters rule the roost.  So, players who experiment with their homemade scenarios should try to account for the various melee, ranged, and force based characters and seek some kind of balance.  A light game to introduce the youngsters to the hobby - but not much more.

The figures and paintjobs are well done for a mass market product. This is my first foray into a CMG, so we'll see how long I last. PS: If you have a brain in your head and you REALLY want to get into this and SAVE MONEY, have a copy or two of the game Epic Duels on standby to feel the power of some of the rares/very rares. (That is, if you have access to the card stats for the SWM rares/very rares.) Having access to a copy of Queen's Gambit (see both) wouldn't hurt, either.

My criterion for rating games


http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: The wide variety of maps, scenarios from the books, and types of squads make this game play out quite differently each time. Also the theme and looks really bring you into the game. A little samey as far as the gameplay though. Rush up, fight, end game

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. Great decision opportunities throughout the game from the making of your squad, to troop deployment, to strategy within the game.

3) Player interaction:   Combat, and lots of tactical movement. This game has a TON of interaction.

4) Components/artwork:  Fantastic miniatures and the artwork is nice.

5) Game length/complexity:  Length of the game is ok, but with building squad, pulling minis out, and the wide variety of special abilities this one can be a little tough to teach and to play with newbs. Takes a little too long to setup. If you come with prebuilt squads it is better, but this requires a dedicated gaming group.


Bottom line: This is a great miniatures combat game. I always have a good time playing it. I haven't played in a while and I need to get it back to the table.

I used to own these, but I think that I left them at my friend's house, and they are buried in his basement somewhere.  Either that, or I already traded them away.

Rules are dumbed down version of D&D Minis which are dumbed down version of Chainmail which was the streamlined version of the d20 combat system.  Sort of a d20 for Dummies.  Quick and easy for beginners, really pales in comparison to real miniature wargames though.  The cheeze based power plays makes you want to buy more booster packs to get the rare uber-mini.

Prepainted vinyl minis are somewhat better than the D&D minis, but still would rather pay more for good quality unpainted pewter ones.  Hate the whole random thing.  Only thing going for it is it's Star Wars.

I like this game (mostly)the mechanics , though hardly earth-shattering, work well to give a simple skirmish based wargame that does feel like Star Wars. At first I felt the lack of a proper morale system but the squads are small the weapons generally lethal to all but major characters and many of the eg. combatants eg. droids, clones and Jedi would be tend to be unaffected anyway. Perhaps rules fro pinning fire are needed. The components are great, the starter set is particularly good value - you get a proper quality game board and box as well as 2 major characters. The only thing stopping me from giving this an 8 or 9 is the collectible aspect but I guess this annnoying marketing trick is here to stay - worst luck!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I would defiantly recommend this game if you have enjoyed Epic Duels.

The game play is more complex as you have more game play going on rather than just "card and roll" - however it is well worth it. The game play itself is simple even if remembering all the stats isn't. 

If you are looking for a proper game I would recommend this miniatures however if you were looking for a filler game I would personally go with Epic Duels

I enjoyed this miniatures game.
It seemed a little simpler then the D&D Mini Skirmish, but still just as challenging.

It just took a back seat to the D&D though, because I liked the D&D setting more.

A really fun game though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
OK, the obvious downside is the collectable distribution of the game- it sucks here just like it does in every other collectable game but the good news is that this is a fast, fun miniatures game that dispenses with a lot of the nonsense and bookkeeping that plagued the D&D mini system.  The rules are solid- detailed but not overly so and there are provisions that make even a lowly ewok or stormtrooper a viable squad pick. The result is a completely accessible game that probably has better "gateway game" clout with nongamers than any silly game involving train routes or anything to do with renaissance trading.  I think the game derives its strength primarily from its license- indeed, if you're a Star Wars fan you'll be thrilled to see your favorite characters pop out of the boosters and you'll be tickled at some of the bizarro and hilarious matchups that inevitably happen- like IG-88 vs. Princess Leia or that Tusken Radier vs. Wampa fight you've always imagined.  The game takes to scenario play extremely well but 100pt multiplayer games are a real treat- we call it "Star Wars Beatdown".  Looking forward to the space battle component!

RATING: 6
I did not find this game to be nearly as good as Heroclix. I find two things in particular I really don't like. The first is the initiative roll which can and does determine the game far too often. Its such a huge swing factor for one or two die rolls at critical times. Secondly the Jedi's in particular have only one or two special abilites and most of the expected Jedi powers dark and light only appear sporadically on some characters. I would have expected each Jedi depending on ability to have a range of say 5-10 abilities to pick from with varing levels of force strength to spend on operating those abilities. If you haven't played let me give an exagerated example. Obi Wan has healing, Yoda has force push and Mace has extra speed. What the heck is that. Wouldn't the top Jedi's have all the abilities. I mean you can say Heroclix isn't exactly accurate either but its a lot closer. Yes they are both fantasy worlds but I still expect some reality in my fantasy. No its not an oxymoron IMHO. On the positive side taken stickly as a strategic exercise you can plan out numerous teams with some great interacting powers similar to Heroclix but not with the same depth and because of that initiative die roll it kind of lessens the strategy for me.

Note:  These comments are from the perspective of a mom who is a novice to miniatures gaming (and I've never had someone around to teach me these types of games so we're trying to wing it on our own here)!
I'm playing this with my son the Star Wars fanatic, and though I can see the fun in the game, that's been tempered somewhat by the fact that my son wants to play epic battles consisting of about 15-20 characters per side lasting 3+ hours.  SIGH.  I want him to enjoy the games, but trying to do this while learning the game and all the line of sight, special abilities, and various other rules that accompany miniatures games just makes for a frustrating experience.  We go through the same routine with Heroscape.  I'm working on trying to convince him to take smaller bites until we have a better handle on how things run.  OK, rant over (for now).
This is a good game for kids beginning around age 8 or so.  Since we are not well-versed in miniatures, it is taking us longer than usual to get up to speed on the rules so our games tend to be very halting affairs.  I can see how this would be more entertaining once we have a good grasp on how things work -- the question is, do we have the patience to dedicate that kind of time to the game when there are so many other great games out there beckoning...  Time will tell.  For now, since my son is excited about playing, I'll definitely continue to play.

A neat game, but the figure distribution is terrible. If you buy boosters, be prepared to field armies of ewoks and jawas. Many of the rares are obscure characters from comic books.

Out of more than 10 7-figure boosters supposedly featuring characters from the original trilogy, for rares I got 2 R2-D2s, 2 General Rieekans, one Luke Skywalker Rebel Commando, and a bunch of characters who aren't at all familiar. They're joined by a bunch of generic stormtroopers, rebel troopers, ewoks and jawas.

Yes, we love Star Wars. Yes, we love miniatures games. And since this is just basic rules, with an awesome theme ;-) and with such a wide variety of settings, big or small setup, scenario, game goal etcetera... What's not to love about it!
Okay, the basic rules can grow extremely with all the character cards, I admit.
And yes, to have enough for real replay-ability, you need to spend some money...

Category: Children's tactical miniature wargame.

The playing boards and rules around the Force are both really poor, but the pieces are cool and gameplay is fun. Children, predictably, love the theme.

RATING: 8
The cards themselves create all the flavor you need to create the sort of pitch battles you always wanted to see in the "Star Wars" universe.  Although the collectible aspect irritates, it's still an effective and fun way to keep playing with your "Star Wars" action figures long past the age of social responsibility.

Decent figures, simplistic but quite playable rules, and an absolutely excellent setting.  Here's your chance to play out some of those battles in the movies - if you're lucky enough to acquire the main characters.  The collectible aspect of this game is real problem and far and away its worst feature.  My rating would have been two points higher but for the cynical way this game is being sold.

Was my favorite pre-painted miniatures game, until Dreamblade came along.  Also has some sweet figures in this category too.

I got into this just as I was getting sick of collectible games.  After spending $100 on boosters and no Han, Chewie, R2 or C3P0, I was done with collectible games for good.  The game itself is fun enough, if a bit simple.  Lack of maps hurts it, unless you want to buy the expansion books.

RATING: 6
Played once.  Not bad for a quick diversion.  I prefer the older West End Star Wars miniatures game, but that game is also a lot more "hard core" than this game; this game is meant to be a fairly quick pick-up miniatures skirmish game set in the Star Wars universe.  I'd play it again, but am unlikely to invest in the game.

RATING: 10
This was the first, and last collectible game that ever really sucked me in. I LOVE Star Wars, and the chance to skirmish with my heroes and stormtroopers made for quite an addiction.

It is a simple game at heart, but the interactions between special abilities and powers cause some for a lot of concentration, and some undue complications. 

That being said, this is probably my favourite game of all time.

RATING: 10
This is one of my favorite games ever. Based on the Star Wars universe with many figures from the original trilogy, the prequel, and the expanded universe.  Very fun rules + over 700 different figures + a couple of dozen different maps = lots of great ways to play.

Back when I played Star Wars RPG in college - I wish we had the minis then, because the combat interested me more than the roleplaying.  And, actually, it's even what I wanted my childhood to be like.  I had all the Kenner action figures, but I would have rather played a game like this with them.  

Detailed wants and trades for SWM are available on www.bloomilk.com under this same username.

If you're interested in this game, the online community for the game is most active on www.bloomilk.com.  They aren't making new miniatures, but the active community is creating new virtual sets (Vsets), which are statistics to be used with proxy figures.  The Vsets are legal for the regional tournaments and the championship at GenCon.  Feel free to send me messages about this game if you have questions.

This isn't a bad game, it's just not very good.  Once I figured out you can conga-line your guys behind a high-defense character and move in on the enemy nearly impervious to ranged fire due to the lame targeting rules, I stopped playing.  This is a good example of a miniatures game that is on the low side of mediocre, but still better than Heroscape.

RATING: 6
Not as deep as it could have been, and definitely painful on the wallet to try and collect...but it is a fun experience in the SW world.


EDIT:  Though I enjoyed collecting this at first, it's obvious that the sets are just going to keep up churning and this game is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced.  I just can't pay for random components any more, that sucks.

Plus, this system REALLY could use a little more meat on it.  It's a tad too simple.

This game was my bread-n-butter for the better part of 6 years.  Highly recommended for fans of Star Wars or fans of tactical miniature-based games, and an absolute 'must have' if you love both.  For the most part the figurines are beautifully painted and very durable (there were notable exceptions), allowing for years of enjoyment and possible integration into other Star Wars games.  The only setback is that this was collectable and a money sink.  Avid fans keep this game alive with virtual card sets and new map packs.  Check out bloomilk.com for the latest.

I have a soft spot for all things Star Wars, so my view might be considered slighly askew, but I find this game to just be heaps of fun.  I thought it was "okay" the first time I played it, but after the 2nd set came out and I played it again, I was having a great time with it.  Was super fun to set up even matched games for my buddies to play while we waited in line for Episode 3.  I love the collectibility aspect too, but I can see this being a turnoff to a lot of people.  But as long as you are not playing in a competitive environment, then this really isn't an issue.

RATING: 8
Amazing game for fast, tense, skirmish-level miniature gaming.  You don't need to be a Star Wars fan to love this game:  the theme helps (I'm a moderate fan), but the game stands on it's own legs.  I've quit collecting any of the miniatures several sets ago (alas), but the replay value is high with even a modest-sized collection.

My only complaint is that squad construction can be very unbalanced, causing for a lot of boring and heavily lop-sided games.

Solo-gaming factor:  middle to low.

Mass Battle of Hoth at Gen Con 2015. Beautiful set-up, with 5 AT-ATs, 2 AT-STs, against 16 speeders, 6 gun turrets, 6 cannons, and lots of rebel troops who started inside the base. Unfortunately, lopsided gameplay meant imperial players could only move their AT-AT forward and roll a single D20 to hit the shield generator each turn: boredom set in and three imperial players left the game inside an hour.

My husband and I got back into this game. I am looking forward to playing again. It's a fun combat game that doesn't change rules for each new minis release like heroclix. The powers are easy to understand since they make sense based on who/what the figure is. The figures are beautiful. I like that the new starter set comes with a map board rather than the little paper maps. This game can be played with scenerios from the movie or built up armies based on points. Either way, its a fun game.

RATING: 9
Excellent game, from scouts skirmish to major assault to spaceship boarding to you name it, everything feels like it should, from jedi knights to the AT-AT to soldiers combining fire to improve their effectiveness to commanders boosting their men, you'll feel like each decision's impact has as much of an in-world explanation as a mechanics explanation. It's a shame it went out of print but the very last sets were declining in quality so in a sense, I'm glad I've got a high quality set. God I miss that feeling of opening another booster and always finding something fun inside!

On the game itself, will take a little while to be able to play it competently (stuff like combining fire and attacks of opportunity work to make the gameplay more interesting but also more balanced and workable), it takes a while to play as you'll be figuring out cover and line of sight but every little struggle is really enjoyable and every shot a cliffhanger! I hope Imperial Assault will do until they re-roll this some day...

I just cannot get down with this game...either its the fact that I don't like SW enough (don't know any characters outside of the movies), or something is wrong with the game...the rules and balance don't seem that right (it always seems to give a huge advantage the player that goes first).

:thumbsup: customizeable

:thumbsdown: fiddly line of site determination

Despite the output randomness of rolling a D20 as a combat resolution mechanism, and the fiddly-ness of determining line of sight and/or cover, and some terribly un/balanced characters, I inexplicably enjoy this game.

Sadly, it died under the weight of it's own Skinnerian distribution model, and an over-saturated market of collectible games.

I've played this a number of times now and have collected quite a number of characters. I wish I could say this was a great game, but it's not.

RATING: 6.5
The game itself is solid, but the horrible, horrible "collectable" aspects drag the game down (even more than D&D Minis). Simply put, the more you spend on the game, the more you win. Nearly 50% of the game's figures are rares or very rares, and those are always the best figures. The thrill of leading a group of Stormtroopers into a battle or commanding a mob of Ewoks is torn apart by the "rare is best" mentality. Skip this unless you seriously can put $300+ into it every time a new set is released.

I enjoy using the miniatures to accompany the Star Wars Roleplaying Game (using the rules from West End Games).  The game itself lacks the feel of the original miniatures game (also by West End Games) and also lacks the intensity of tactical level games.

The original rules were crap, the mini's were deformed and the power creep was insane but boy did we have fun with this game back in its day. I have so many fond memories of playing 4-6 player brawls with this game back when I was broke and should have not been buying them. I have around 2,000+ of these still and I get them out and play with my son from time to time. They are also great for Imperial Assault!

Love the minis! The best detail and gorgeous sculpts. The game play is very basic and may not be considered great by table top fans, but it is the best thing to happen to SW. I love that the RPG is also supported by these minis making them good for double use. Wish something like this existed back when I was a kid and spending all my allowance on Ral Partha. If you like table top games but are scared away by the statistics and physics of some rules, this is a good starter or basic variation for quick and simple game play. As new expansions have come out, I'm getting more and more tired of the collectibility element. Some expansions I've bought NONE of simply because I'm still trying to get minis from expansions before. And of course, older versions of some characters get useless and outdated... another frustration with collectibles. However, again, when I'm in the mood for table tops this is a great one to break out and get into the spirit of without rule refreshers and is finished in an hour or two.

Great abstraction of the SW universe in miniatures format. Fun. But it is abstracted quite a bit. The main drawback being that although not overly detailed, the rules can be very tricky with lots of rules being modified or clarified in documentation found online. So you often can't trust what's written on the cards or in the rules books that come with the various sets.

It is collectable, so more a lifestyle than a game, but it is still a brilliant game! I have no desire to back date games played, but there is much more time to it (squad building, strategy discussions) that even the number of plays would not show how much I get out of the game.

The miniatures really are amazing. I rarely play nowadays but I will get back into it one day: until then you will regularly see my minis appear in photographs!

RATING: 6
A lot of people I know love this game, and it does have a certain charm to it but I find the rules to be wacky.  There's always some bizzare situation having to do with line of sight or cover that comes up during the game which leads to a ludicrous situation that is well-covered in the rules but makes no logical sense.  My favorite example of this is where I couldn't shoot at one guy because of some stealth ability or something, but he was still (somehow) providing cover for the guys behind him. 

My collection includes about 25 figures each of Imperial and Rebel factions.

Simple little miniatures combat game driven by a d20 and special powers for the collectible pieces.

AWESOME looking figurines, despite being pre-painted plastic. The continual release of sets, artificial rarity and random miniatures contribute to the suckyness of the game overall. Simplified D20 rules are terrible and unbalanced costing makes some matches painful to play.

The only way to have fun with the existing rules is to build armies for fun, and not to win. Exploiting the bad costing just to win a match in an already broken game is just really lame.

However, it still gets a 10 because the rules and costing is meangingless, all that matters are the figures because you can make up your own game.

Update: Back down to a 6 just to be honest.

Great, fast, starwars themed game. I do recommend. However, playing squads of stormtroopers Vs Rebels (lets say 10-12 figs per side) Slows the game down alot.

Game in a Nutshell: A structured game of 'army men' using collectible Star Wars characters.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: Ok, a miniatures game took me by surprise. Can't... let it... get... the be$t of me. Played with a friends 'smaller' collection and even at that, it showed a good amount of re-playability with the different factions and maps. Impressed how fast time goes by while playing. Rules are simple enough and the game has a great tactical feel.

Cons: The collectible aspect of the game isn't something I want to get started into. I look at how easy it would be to put $100 into the game and still feel like I wanted more versus what multiple, different games I could have for the same investment. Not only that, there's a nerdiness factor to get over when looking for people to play with. Set-up / picking characters takes a fair chunk of time.

Other: I think I realized after one play, this is a game about the journey, not the destination.  

Best Use: When regular board games aren't nerdy enough.

RATING: 7
It is relatively simple but still has some tactics. You can get up and running pretty quickly. There are tons of figures and ways to build squads that have complementary abilities. Building good squads (or just recreating famous scenes) is part of the fun.

Yeah, it's collectible. So what? Don't be an idiot power buyer. Be a smart collector. The commons/grunts/cannon fodder are cheap and easy to get. Add to that the useful uncommons and the rares you like best. Then if you really love it, trade for a collection. It's not a big deal, to be honest, for a game you love. And if you don't love it, then why would you invest a ton of money in it anyway? I think the "ohmygodcollectible!" criticism is pretty weak.

Personally, I like it and am happy to trade for useful stuff and buy when I get a great deal. I've got a nice storage system set up and a willing opponent, and I couldn't be happier about the simplicity and variety of the game.

Right now, I think the things I'd consider trading for would be:
Han, different versions of Luke, Chewbacca.
Maps

Collectible through random figures? Part of the past now. Annoying initiative rule that makes it like a cross between a bad RPG and a mini game.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a team is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

RATING: 5
As a CMG there's plenty to like and plenty to hate here.

I like the universal movement, unlimited range and initiative test for mixing up turn order. Love the minis even though I'm only a "standard strength" fan of Star Wars. The game itself is like a boosted Epic Duels and it was well supported with lots of maps and plenty of sets for diversity whilst active. Excellent maps and models for Star Wars Roleplaying fans.

Unfortunately like all CMGs it's let down by its collectable aspect (which been Star Wars is magnified 10 fold), as I really want characters from the films (as I don't know all the others) which just happen to also be all the rare/super rares which everyone else wants and go for anywhere up to £175.00 each (they're small pieces of plastic for GOOs sake!!!!!!). Instead you end up with a load of non-descript aliens that appeared in a background scene for 1.5 seconds.

Also the individual point cost of models is a bit misleading in this game as for 10 points you get a grunt that will die if anyone sneezes at him and can only do so much as scratch a Jedi if they get a lucky critical hit, whilst for 20 points you can get a guy that can strip the crap out of a 75pt model in two hits, whilst ANY character with a Force rating usually beats everything else hands down, usually thanks to a stupidly overpowered ability which deals automatic, unavoidable  damage.

I prefer the team building and straight forward  meatgrinder/deathmatch of Horrorclix or the strategy of Monsterpocalypse to Star Wars Minis, but the girlfriend loves the Star Wars genre so I'm happy to play it for her sake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Star Wars Miniatures is a load of fun - but only if you invest a LOAD of cash.  Even then, you will probably not have the minis you need in order to play the scenarios published in the various scenario books (but you'll buy them anyway for the maps).  Budget conscious gamers should stay clear.  

However, the game "feels" like Star Wars.  The miniatures rules are simple but the unique abilities of the many models keeps things interesting and replayable.

Skirmish with very cool miniatures. Map squares are 25 mm.

The characters' stats and special powers are designed to match their movie or expanded universe counterparts very closely [*]. Meaning, it really feels like Star Wars. Especially when using the scenario books, which take the game beyond ordinary skirmishes.

[*] (Except for the Yuuzhan Vong, obviously. Why don't they have any bonuses against droids?)

Anyhow, it's collectible.

The rarity distribution sucks big time: The only reasonable method for getting any of the interesting (= rare) miniatures is eBay.

The Champions of the Force set is completely uninteresting, full of generic or far-fetched cannon fodder. Luckily, the  Bounty Hunters set is a bit more interesting. The new Alliance & Empire set is quite bad again but at least it has three new Ewok figures.

The new Battle of Hoth pack is far inferior to the Endor pack. There's only one map and only one decent scenario. And two of the Hoth Troopers included are identical. The Clone Wars pack is even less useful, consisting almost entirely of reprints, and including no scenarios at all.

Gamplay is reasonable but not very satisfying...too many open shots.  The modular map is a nice touch.  Overall I am surprised that this somwhat-thin game rates higher than Lord of the Rings TMG or even Heroclix.  I suspect this is due to the Star Wars theme, which is more important than game play to alot of players I guess, or its d20-ness which makes it accessible.

With Sith expansion I bumped up my rating slightly; the mounted map and new figure abilities make the game slightly more interesting.

The Mission books make the game more replayable and enjoyable.

The miniatures are just awesome, while the game works and gets the job done. As a wargamer, I like my rules set to be a bit more complicated, so we used WEG's Miniatures Battles rules released in the early 1990s.  The ground scale is the same, and the figures and maps from Rebel Storm may be readily. If you are interested in SF tabletop games (and you  don't hate SW), make sure to get this one!

Fairly expensive to build your armada, as you will have to buy (around) 15$ boosters, with 7 miniatures per booster, and quite a few of them. But if you're into star wars, and collecting, and board games, then you'll probably have a great time.
Another thing that may make it lose (or even gain) a point (depending on your perspective), the rules do take quite a bit of time to read and fully understand. they are fairly complicated.
If you already have played (and read the rules of) another "Wizards of the Coast" game, then this game shouldn't be to challenging to grasp.
One other BIG pro: lots of varitey of maps that you can buy to keep the game fresh, and new (maps do need to be flattened, just thought that I should mention that).
Hope that helped you get an idea of the game, I personally really like it!

The 'game' is pretty decent ruleswise.  It's very simplistic and very gamey as opposed to wargame simulation and that fits well with SW.  The collectibility is somewhat annoying along with the uber-poweredness of some of the very rare characters (esp. Emperor).  

Revised upward after I discovered our group was grossly misinterpreting the rules in favor of Force-powered characters.

I absolutely loved this game. I had to get rid of my collection because buying boosters almost became an addiction. I find this game to be a very satisfying experience but I couldn't afford it anymore.  I was spending way more than I should have and they kept pumping out new sets.  It's because of this game that I realized I can never play or purchase another collectible game again.

This game is wonderful. Just pure fun.  Completely captures the atmosphere of Star Wars tactical battles without overloading us with obscure rules.  Beautiful, pre-painted miniatures complete the package.  One of my all time favorite games and one that my kids love too!  It never should have gone out of print.

If I was rating the miniatures and the maps this would get a 10 but unfortunately the rules are rubbish. They work but are very uninteresting. Having to keep track of hits on individual figures is simply a pain particularly if you use multiples of the same figure. From memory people in Star Wars get hit once and once only before going down so the trick should be not to get hit not the ability to take multiple hits.

I like Star Wars and miniatures are a bonus. The primary issue is having gotten into the game rather late and my lack of desire to pay the large amount of money for some of the favorite pieces. There is also quite a bit more variety of playing pieces than I am familiar with because i do not read the books. I have the Hoth set that was being sold exclusively through Target as well as the not so miniature AT-AT though its box is in a bit of rough shape. I have miniatures ranging across many sets. I collect to play but do not collect to collect if that makes sense. If you are looking for a particular piece, send me a geekmail.

A fun game that catches the feel of the Star Wars universe decently well. Scrubs drop left and right as heroes make their stand, only to be finally taken down by other heroic figures or a whole lotta gunfire. I really enjoy playing prequel-era battles with SWM, but it features units from all times in the Star Wars timeline.

RATING: 4
Simple miniatures game with a SW theme, compatible with the RPG and just above acceptable pre-painted minis (I'm a miniature painter myself and they've not done good here). Still, enjoyable and I'm collecting it, aiming to play some more when the Knights of the Old Republic expansion is released - as a companion to the RPG. The game itself doesn't attract me.

RATING: 7
Easy single game of little battles.  It could be outstanding with just a few more official scenarios with special missions to avoid playing the last man standing mode.

It almost always comes down to the two strongest characters in the game having a slugfest in the end, in my experiences anyway.

While I was excited to see the new Star Wars RPG and hearing of a miniatures game to be connected with it, I was sorely disappointed that WOTC decided to make it a "collectable" game (that's what happens when Decipher/Wiz Kids calls the shots). If I want to buy a squad of Stormtroopers, I shouldn't have to buy several boxes to see if I got the ones I want. The rules are nice and easy for those who are starting into the whole "miniatures" game but I felt the rules were a little dumbed down for those of us have been into wargaming for a while. On the plus side, the minis look really nice (though rather out of scale for those of us who play the Star Wars Miniatures Battles) and there is plenty of fan support on the web. My recommendation is if you like Star Wars and are new to miniature gaming, it's worth buying the starter set and a few boosters.

This game is a great gateway into miniature games. Its mechanics are based off the d20 system as used in the Saga Edition rpg. You're rolling attacks with bonuses, against defense (AC), subtracting damage from hit points. 
Very simple, yet very quick and light. There is a good amount of strategic depth (hey, I'm undefeated for a reason), as provided  by the many different abilities and synergies. 
The Bad stuff about it: First off, it's collectible. You have to buy a bunch, but once you do, you have plenty to play with. I reccomend checking out Miniature Market. Get the starter for you and a freind, then buy some boosters. You'll soon have what you need. 
I've had a lot of fun with this game. It's definitely a great way to sap time, as long as you can get past the collectibility.

Gets a 9 for fun game play, the game really is quite easy to learn and fast to play. Lots of tactical decisions to make and its not totally deviod of strategy.

Beautiful miniatures.  Rating as a game and a hobby.  When in the mood for a miniatures game this is the one I'll pick.  Straight forward rules with enough extra elements to make it interesting, but not bogged down. Star Wars is a theme with characters that everyone knows about (the big downside for 40K IMO) and these minis have a huge amount of characters to choose from.  Also a plus is the ability to use your miniatures with the RGP game or the older miniatures rules and just collecting the minis is fun (though a little painful to the wallet).

Basically a streamlined version of the D&D Miniatures rules with a heck of a lot more range - from blasters to snipers to missiles to grenades.

Good, solid fun.  Really captures the feel of the Star Wars setting in a combat miniatures game a lot better than certain other collectable miniatures games based on licensed properties have done for their own source material.  

Of course, like all collectible games, there is always a small but ever expanding number of figures that are annoyingly unbalanced in gameplay.  And the dominance of ranged attacks means that your "average" jedi is in for a very bad day.  But it's still pretty darn fun, and, like I said, it plays quite a bit closer to its theme than most other CMGs.

RATING: 7
A collectible skirmish game based on Wizards of the Coast's D20 combat system, featuring a wealth of characters and vehicles from nearly every era of the Star Wars universe. The quality of the character models have varied with each release, going from truly awful in the Clone Wars set to excellently sculpted in Bounty Hunters. The stat cards have also gone through a few iterations, but they have always been pretty bland anyway, especially when compared to the rest of the game's components.

The skirmish rules themselves do an excellent job of creating battles that feel right for the Star Wars universe. Most games start with a ranged shoot-out and end with a close-up clash of lightsabers. The cover rules can be a little confusing for new players, but they add significant depth to the system and are largely responsible for the game's authentic feel. I only wish it scaled better to higher point games. The massive ground battles often featured in the movies are largely unplayable with this rules set. Also, there are a handful of severe imbalances in a few character abilities, and playing against them in opposing squads can be frustrating. This is easily avoided in casual play, but hurts the game's tournament appeal. 

My biggest complaint about Star Wars Miniatures is its cost. The game is extremely hard to collect due to the inordinately large amount of ultra-rare figures, usually 16-18 per set. Collecting a complete set requires a perfect pull from the purchase of FOUR CASES of figures at about $150.00 a pop (and that's assuming a discounted price). In recent years, booster prices have crept up to a MSRP of $14.99 and $22.99 for the Huge figure expansions. Twenty-five bucks is a pretty significant investment for a blind purchase, especially when there is a good chance of pulling a trash rare or a duplicate figure.  The escalating price of playing has turned me off a bit and the seemingly endless expansions have added new characters but not much in the way of new mechanics. Quite frankly, I am starting to feel like the seemingly endless expansions are just WOTC cashing in while they rehash what they have already done.

RATING: 7
Very biased on this as I love all things Star Wars. Great game. Very easy to learn and play. I'm mainly attracted to the countless possibilities that result from so many different characters. Also can be fun for those who like the collecting aspect of it. You can taylor the game to the length you want it to be. Only annoying thing is that they release new sets too often.

Update 4/1/10: No longer a problem of new sets being released too often, there won't be any more new sets. Also this game has now taken a back seat to Heroscape for me.

[b]I BENT MY WOOKIE![/b]

I'd like to bless my comments with another phrase or two about the "power of the dark side", "the force", or "these are the figures you want", etc, but they've all been done to death by every other commentator on the Geek. What a ruddy shame!

Like the stunningly good D&D miniatures, these Star Wars models are so good by themselves that you do not need to use the D20ish system that they suggest you play with. I won't.

What is absolutley freakin' marvellous about these little pieces of moulded plastic, is that you can act out any scenario in the SW universe, just like you did as a snotty lad, roll dice, make up any rules system you want, and have a bloody good time doing it, because all the characters are catered for; with the possible exception of the Space Slug, Garbage monster, etc. The figures are about 28mm  - the BEST scale - and are nicely painted, mostly, with great sculpting.

Q: Who wants to play with a couple of AT-STs and blast a forest chock-full of nasty little Ewoks?
Q: Who dreams of recreating the Hoth battle?
Q: Who'd like to move an army of battle droids about a dining-room table, ruled over by Grievous, Jedi Hunter?
Answer: ME!
All these scenes, and more, can be expanded by the use of this range.

As with D&D, these models are sorted by rarity into blind boxes. Genius marketing. I'd do it too. You know you would as well. I don't want to collect them all - which would be madness. I just want to craft memorable Star Wars scenarios.

You may get some bent models (Battle Droids seem to be the worst), but that issue is solvable with the old hot'n'cold trick.

My favourite miniatures: [i]Droideka, Jango Fett, Rancor, Cody, and any clone trooper or battle droid.[/i]

RATING: 10
One of the best games I've ever played and continue to play. If I could give this game an 11 out of 10, I would.

The virtual sets, on the other hand, are a pox upon this fantastic game. The virtual sets need to be eradicated completely.

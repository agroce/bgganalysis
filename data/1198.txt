Interesting spacial relations game in terms of pattern recognition. Fairly easy to teach, and everyone is pay attention *all the time* which is nice. The greatest ding against the game is that you really want to play with a group who all have similar skill levels, otherwise it becomes rather lopsided fast as the difference between a quarter second of recognition is the difference between winning and losing.

RATING: 4
Too dry and abstract and quiet for my liking. And visually unattractive. The game has such a simple design, the least they could have done was take one second to make sure that colorblind people could play it.

A great, simple game, with cards that can be used for lots of other things.  Again, I like the math and reasoning behind the design, and I wish telepathy was a real thing, because these cards would be perfect for testing it.

Ah, I love this game. But then, I can spot patterns in the most obscure things. This game was pretty much designed for someone with my mind. Once I was half-an-hour late to a game party and everyone else had all started playing this before I arrived. My husband was losing – not badly, but he was not winning by a long shot. Then I stepped in to help him and we took first place. It is so easy for me to see the patterns that it almost feels like I'm cheating when I play...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun little pattern-recognition game. It's essentially a speed test to see who can puzzle out a matching hand the fastest. Other than that, I'm not sure how much "game" there is to it. Fun for what it is, though.

A fun and quick pattern recognition game.  I'm not much of a person who enjoys brainy speed games (e.g., Krypto, SET) even though I enjoy brainy games generally (e.g., Vinhos, Madeira), which is why this doesn't rate super high on my list, but worth getting as a filler game.

This is another game my son likes a bunch, but I find ok.  I give it the ok, b/c it helps young kids with matching - moreso with this game than say memory. Here you can create a match/set based on shape, color, # of items of shading.  This gives the kids a bit more to think about.

I love this game. I've owned several copies because I keep giving them to other players who I infect with the SET-mania. The most difficult part about this game is to wrap your head around the rules, but after that it's all fun and excitement. At game night, players at other tables have trouble staying away. While waiting for their turns they crane their necks to have a look and shout SET!

I've played it with all ages from adults to precocious five-year olds. The thing that most impresses me about this game is that kids can succeed with little to no help or handicapping. While adults are frantically looking for advanced sets, kids will snipe the simple sets. Totally cool.

Set is a fun and unique visual game, but suffers from being a too intuitive (hard to [i]learn[/i]) and from the lack of a good handicapping method (the best is probably to have the stronger player look away from the cards for X seconds after each new 'deal'). It is a great game for kids, and fun to play now and then. Even more, it is a very great design: intelligent, attractive, and accessible.

I like this game, but that's because I'm decent at it.  Try before you buy -- if you suck, you're probably not gonna like it.  You can't exactly read a strategy guide for Set on BGG and suddenly get better -- either your brain sees things a certain way, or it doesn't.

I've played the original card version and also played the spiral book version.

It's a pure abstract. No theme.  
This is probably my favorite solo game so far which is surprising considering how much I enjoy theme.
This plays fine as a 2-player game but I actually prefer it solo. I guess I should try it with higher numbers but I just enjoy it so much solo that I don't see it as an improvement to play it with others.
It's a good game to play if you might be interrupted as each round is extremely short.
I took the spiral book form of this game with me on an airplane and it makes a convenient travel game.

Enjoyable reaction game. I really like the brain burning set building aspect in conjunction with the speed element. The only problem with this game is the significant learning curve. Whoever has played the game the most, will usually win. Which is a reason, why reaction games like this remain on the shelf after a while.

Like maths (and I do), you will love this first time out. Not very keen? You will hate the game. You really need to be able to visualise and analyse several different attributes at once - and quickly. The only time my wife ever played (with me and my son) she stormed off after 5 minutes saying "this is just a waste of brain power".

I am not sure there is too much replayability (hence the low score) and it does just seem to be a measure of a certain sort of spacial reasoning rather than something one could actually describe as a game.

RATING: 10
50 plays:

The first item that goes into the suitcase when we're traveling.

You can start a game in seconds, and everyone in earshot will come over and want to play and be instantly captivated. It's not always obvious who will be good, and almost anyone can win some sets against more talented players. 

Expands effortlessly from 2 players to 10 or so, and everyone has just as good a time and the game goes no slower. How many games can you say that about?

Somehow never, ever gets old.

I came around playing this classic quite recently. I was convinced that I wouldn't like it, as it's not exactly social to sit around staring at cards in deep concentration. Nevertheless, I really like this game. It really forces you to use your raw intelligence and it's very satisfying to find elusive combinations. Might deserve a slightly higher grade, actually.

RATING: 6
Another game (like Soloquest and Tangoes) that I can take anywhere and play when I have a few minutes free.  While playing throught the whole deck does take a while (~30 minutes), playing alone can take as long or as short as you want to.

I've also had good luck playing this with friends.  It is very non-threatening and if it is just left on the table as people are talking, generates somebody finding a set every few minutes.

I haven't had any success getting the kids into it yet but I'm continuing to try.  Update: I showed this to my 4 yro nephew once and he played very well keeping up with me.  He now has his own copy and does quite well with it.  My son (10) is also now enjoying it.

A brilliant idea, and a very novel concept. Can play with as many as you like as informally and as long as you like. The only problem with it is that it can give you crossed eyes and headaches ;-).

RATING: 7
A very easy to explain set-matching game, which can be played with two or more. I've played with some pretty brutal mismatches, though: my wife will generally have a set or two spotted before all 12 cards are down, which makes our two player games lop-sided. Even if you lose, though, you're still involved in the game.

I like Set. For some reason, however, it stresses me out. The missus loves this game and is really angry with me for introducing it to her, then being reluctant to play. The game, somehow, reminds me of crossword puzzles in that it would be more enjoyable playing solo. Obviously, Set would be boring solo as the whole object of the game is to spot the sets before your opponents. But it 'feels' like a solo-type puzzle to me.

The point at which you start seeing the "weird" sets (i.e. the ones where *everything* is different) you can actually feel your brain start to change to adapt to the game.

Yes, 9. This one requires the right kind of people to play--some are just downright frustrated by it. But most break through after a few plays. It's like juggling: takes a while to master, but a lot of fun when you do. But you've got to have a certain kind of visual intelligence to make it work. When you do, and you're really "feeling it," there's nothing like the rush of having it all click, and seeing set after set.

RATING: 8
It takes a bit of time but this game puts your mind into a particular state that is very interesting. You start working almost from an intuitive frame of mind. However, too many games in a row and all you can see are those patterns as your eyes dart back and forth across the room.

The biggest drawback though is that the play process is completely internal, making it very hard to improve at the game (in most games you can learn from what the winner is doing in order to improve), so if someone won the first game, they are very likely to win all the following games as well.

Most unfortunately, the game is completely overshadowed by Ricochet Robots, a game where you can learn from others in order to improve, where the patterns that need discovering are less straight-forward, but that also has that whole stare at the board until you find the answer play dynamic.

I get a little stressed out when I play because of my eagerness to do well. I used to be pretty good at this and I just have to get over the performance anxiety so that I can get back to playing. And THEN I'll be able to crush people again.

Had the chance to play with the designer at a math teacher convention. She was very pleasant. Originally, the cards weren't designed to be for a game, they were designed to track gene inheritence and thus had a scientific purpose. The game apparently happened when her kids played with the cards. Serendipity!

A game that like Ricochet Robots in that I enjoy it far more than I like it.  It scratches a similar realtime pattern matching itch to Bongo while remaining its own game.

This game requires an ability to quickly recognize patterns and distinctions. Since I tend toward the 'slow and ponderous thought' types of games (and games having more depth), I am not particularly enthusiastic about this game. However, it is a gift from an in-law, so I am willing to play along - so long as my wife suffers along with me.

Pretty clever design-wise, the rules are simplicity itself and yet it's without a doubt a game of skill. But it rewards brains wired unlike mine which makes it more like work than fun for me, subjectively. I respect it even as I do not love it.

I have nothing against competitive IQ testing.  For example, I like Digit quite a bit.  But Set is perliously close to broken -- a word I don't use at all lightly.  The problem is that everybody in my family (including my 5yo!!) can usually spot a set in less than a second.  So much so that my kids have taken to using the strategy of calling "set" immediately, figuring that they'll have time in the second or two after calling "set" to actually find one! The game, such as it is, depends entirely on the assumption that finding sets is at least a little difficult.  If that assumption is false, then there's no game left!

This is too much of a mental dexterity game for my taste.  The game itself is ok but I am just too slow to really enjoy it.  There is no stategy, it is you against the others to spot the Set of cards that meet the criteria.  I only play it when others will play nothing else....maybe.

I like this game for sentimental reasons (it was my first purchased game and my husband and I played it during my labor with our first child).  It's fun, but it doesn't get much play because it's highly unbalanced between those who think in a set-matching kind of way and those who don't -- for the victor and (especially) the vanquished, consistent domination is not a whole lot of fun.

With children, it can be played as an activity -- with each of mine, I've used a "find the 3rd card that completes a set with these 2, and you can have them" variant, and we've enjoyed it.

I've played Set a couple of times, and it's simply a dizzying game.  I'm totally mixed on it, so don't watch my rating too closely.  It's tons of fun, but the one day I played it, my brain was shutting down, and there is no chance with Set if the brain isn't working properly.  I had a good time, but it just was too much for my mind to take at that moment.  I'll see what I think after my next round of playing it.  If you don't want to think in a game, don't even consider Set.

I fail to see the fun in playing this game competitively, since a small difference in skill will cause you not only to do worse than your opponent, but actually your opponent will indirectly and continously point out what you were supposed to do a few seconds earlier than you could.

Although simple in rules length, it requires quite a bit of concentration!  It took quite a while to comprehend what makes a "set".  

The scoring is harsh as well--each time you call a set that isn't one, you lose a set's worth of cards!

This game requires you to use a different part of your brain than most other boardgames do.  Requires pattern/color recognition.  Set makes a quick, light filler game.  Not my cup of tea.

Great little brain burner that you would think would be so easy, yet...

There's a feeling when you play piano or guitar of using your whole brain in unison - both right and left. SET gives you a similar feeling. You can't play well by counting or thinking or mentally labeling - you have to sort of quiet yourself and just 'see' the answers. 

I find it impossible to stay in that state for very long (20 min?) but when the game is over I feel as though I've done some very healthy mental exercise.

(May 31, 2012) I enjoy this as a brain burner because I can play it solo. I don't see it as a great competitive multi-player game. The occurrences of there not being any legal set on the table comes up quite a bit, though. Much more than advertised by the game.

(July 20, 2015) Update: I dread bringing this game out, and despite how "rare" it is, I frequently find myself with a splay of cards where no match is possible. The amount of pruning of matches is probably what contributes to this, but more and more, even when I manage to pull this out, I don't make it very far through the deck before I put it up again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great game. It&#039;s true that it feels a bit like multiplayer solitaire and it is definitely a brain burner. Also, if one player has even a small edge then they will walk away with the game, but it is fun to play. However, don&#039;t play against anyone under the age of 16 if you want retain your dignity. Young brains seem to do the pattern matching much better than older ones.

Not my favourite real-time game, but definitely good one.
Still has standard problem with each round as almost separate puzzle - one player (if he's good) can win all rounds and "spoil" all fun for the rest.
Good game, but with ricochet robots as main competition on my shelves, it has no chance.

(2-8) Lay out 12 cards out. Each card has four characteristics - shape, color, pattern, and symbol count. A set is 3 cards with all characteristics the same, or all characteristics different. The first player to see a Set says so, and takes it. Most sets wins.

(As of [b]?[/b] plays) A pain to teach, a headache to learn and addictive to play. Explaining what does and does not constitute a set is a pedagogical nightmare, but it is worth the effort. Once people are familiar with the concepts involved, the game picks up speed. Can be frustrating for those who don't "get" it.

Not as terrible as I thought it was going to be.  I always had a prejudice for this game as it was usually on the shelves of Monopoly-style gamers and families.  In the end, it's a brain-burning speed game which has elements that I like.  It very much comes off more like a cognitive assessment of visual reasoning skills than of a game- so I'm not sure I found it "fun".  But I'm always up for a race!  This game can leave you feeling stupid for no good reason.  That's my only warning!

Boring. Painful. When it comes to playing this game well, you either got it, or you dont. You're trying to observe patterns faster than the other players.

Short of her getting lobotomized and thus giving me even close to a chance of winning, I don't see any reason why I'd choose to ever play this again.

My play record should probably run into hundreds if I bother logging them all in.  Always trying to trim my personal best for this game.

I love puzzle games. I'm a geometry teacher (so I love shapes). People expect me to really like this game. I don't. It is the speed element. I've never been the biggest fan of speed games. That just kills this game for me.

(Somehow I like the speed element of Ricochet Robots and Factory Fun. Weird.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a simultaneous puzzle, like [GAMEID=51]. And like most games of this style, they have the problem that if a player is slightly better at it than others they will stomp you time after another. The playing of this is fun however and not as frantic as Jungle Speed, another speed pattern recognition game. This is not a main course by any means (I will not play this several times in a row), but is a good filler if you have some time to kill.

This is fast and furious search for patterns.  It's basically a race to solve a perceptual/cognitive puzzle - you have to form 3-card sets from symbols with varying attributes (shape, color, number, shading). Sets are formed when each card in the set is either all the same or all different on a given attribute, but all attributes must be considered when forming the set.  Some sets will jump out at you (all of same shape, shading, and/or color = the classic "pop-out" effect from the psychology of visual attention), while others can be very difficult to see (sets where all attributes are different). Some people seem to have a natural ability to quickly search out and find the sets, which can make it frustrating for those who are more deliberate (though there is a penalty for falsely calling a set). It's fast and reasonably fun, even if you do get trounced.  If you feel like flexing your perceptual muscles, Set makes for good exercise.

This is a fast paced trick taking game.  The trick is that the cards have abstract attributes, and you have to have sets where these attributes are either completely different or all identical.  It appeals to the visual brain, and is real time.

I have found this game appealing to families, and the time to play is short.  However, it has become one-dimensional to me. I prefer games with a lot more components and victory conditions. For cards, I prefer spades.  For visual thinking, I prefere Ricochet Robots.

Here are the rules: you lay out cards on a table, and grab 'sets' of three cards that share an attribute (shape, number, color, texture). When there are no sets left, replenish the cards. Player that gets the most sets wins.

Should be easy to determine whether you would like this game from that description. Easy to teach, so okay party/filler game (but what kind of party?)

Sidenote: I played this as a drinking game once.

Set reminds me of an IQ test, and most of the time I look for differences in the sets rather than similarities.  I wonder what that says about me.

This is one of the games that breaks my bias against packaged card games. Basically it's a visual, speed puzzle of sorts, although accuracy is rewarded over speed. It's a real brain burner! We had to work our way up to playing a full two player game (twice thru the deck). It can be very challenging for people to learn what does and what does not make a "set". This is not for everyone, but if you're visual and like a challenge definitely give it a try. Test yourself on the daily puzzle at setgame.com

A puzzle.  The players intently gaze at the cards on the table until someone finds a set.  Easy to introduce to children and amenable nongamer adults; a fraction of people know right away that they are just not interested, and the others enjoy the puzzle too.
An even better all-players-gaze-at-the-same-puzzle game is Ricochet Robots.

Prolonged staring at a collection of things on a table is not my cup of tea (see Chess). And SET's idea of a set really ain't mine. I seem to spend most of a turn in a kind of frenetic anxiety, persistently doubting there's actually any legal claim to be had. Not fun.

RATING: 9
Set is one of those rare "designer games" that, for some reason, I was exposed to as a young child, far before I ever thought to get serious into board gaming. Thus, I can really speak to its resilience over time - I liked it as much when I was 7 or 8 as I do now in my late 20s. Moreover, it is an excellent family game that is clearly appropriate for a wide age range. Since it is picture based, I actually think it works even younger than its suggested age range, although your mileage may vary based on the individual kid's propensity to sit still and learn the rules. 

Set is elegant and relatively simple to learn, once you get through that annoying learning curve of not really understanding what constitutes a set in the first place. However, all it really takes is a few learning rounds and then you're off to the races - more than once I've taught this game only to be immediately destroyed by the newcomer hitting their stride. 

Also, Set is a remarkably good solitaire game - I either play against a timer, or simply play "Zen mode", trying to find sets at my own pace. It's a nice balance between being mentally engaging without being incredibly mentally taxing. I find the pictures to be strangely calming, as well. 

Overall, Set is another one of my staple family games, and I find myself frequently attracting attention during solo play and inevitably teaching it to someone else, which is the best kind of game evangelism.

Kicsit nehéz megtanítani másokat a szabályokra, és kicsit nehéz ráérezni a SET-ek felismerésére. Versengő játék, nem érdemes lassúaknak és gyorsaknak együtt játszaniuk.

A pretty good game for playing with children, where the challenge comes from trying to be the first to spot sets of three cards in the layout. There's not a whole lot of replay value to the game, but good games that can be played with adults and young children alike are hard to come by and don't often have replayability to begin with, so I'd rather have fun over replay.

A deliriously-fun, fast-paced game of visual acuity. The only downside is that if one person in your game is a bit better at such pattern-matching activities you're in for constant drubbings. 

Then sometimes you marry that person, thinking maybe you've signed up for a lifetime of losing rounds, but one day after you've been married for years you beat her best two of three for the first time in history and you find a whole new love for this game you've been playing willingly for years just to lose.

RATING: 6
The actual challenge of quickly finding sets is fun.  It's pure skill, and finding the trickier sets (where most or all of the aspects are different) lights up the "awesome accomplishment!" parts of your brain.

The problem, though, is that you only need to play it one or two times with a particular group to figure out who's best at it.  If someone's quicker than you, they'll beat you every time, and it'll be very frustrating.  Maybe the answer is "practice on your own to get better", but I think that approach to gaming is too hardcore for a game as light as this.

Set can be pretty fun as a party game, and it certainly attracts a lot of attention.

This abstract game is my favorite game of all times. 
There are 4 parameters: color, figur, shape, and shading. You have to pair 3 cards in a way so, for each parameter, the cards are alike or different. 
N00bs don't have a change against pros, and they tend to get headaches after a few games.
The only problem with this game is to find people who can challenge me.

This is a game that some people are naturally better at than others and it kills.  You are seeking to find sets of 3 in which EACH of the 4 characteristics of the card are either ALL the same across all 3 cards OR ALL different across all 3 cards.  Shading, Quantity of shapes, type of shape, and color are the four areas which you must compare.  As soon as you see a set, yell out "SET!" and pick it out.  If you are wrong, you lose a point.

SET is a good game, in small doses (in my case very small doses). The game has a simple concept but is a lot more "thinky" than it looks. For me the game is fun for 3 or 4 turns, but then becomes too much of a brain burn. In my experience after about 5 minutes I feel like I am having to work rather than having fun. Definitely only a filler game for 5 to 10 minutes for me.

Not much of a fan.  This is another of those 'my brain doesn't work that way' games.  Even when someone else points out a set, I repeatedly hear myself saying, "how the heck is that a...oh yeah, ok."  I also hate speed games, I don't perform well under pressure.  So this one was really frustrating for me.  I'll play it to kill five or ten minutes, but I'll never suggest it or attend a Set-themed game night.

Not only an interesting and fun buzz-in ('Spot') style match game, but a set of quality componentry that lends itself well to abstract game design. The variations of shapes, colors, and amounts/numbers allow for several types of synergistic game-design mechanics to be implemented.

Try translating normal card games to these cards and discover new ways to quantize matter so that it need no longer be represented at smaller than molecular level! Live in a world of abstraction where squigglies tell you what to do, diamonds tell you what to don't do, and ovals tell you that they are actually perfect circles viewed at an oblique angle as if they were printed upon cards!

SET is more than a set. It's a SET of sets fit for Set himself. Set designed SET in his own image and every possible combination of cards tells a unique story about Osiris' murder. Such is deific vanity.

This game is very fun if played like Spoons: Deal out the entire deck to the players. Each player places the next card face up in a grid, until a grid of 12 cards has been formed on the table--if you get that far. The moment a player sees a Set, (s)he slaps the table, then points out the set. (S)he must point out the set immediately and must then name the set correctly by listing every aspect the Set has in common; e.g., three solid purple pills, two striped purple ovals, and one outlined purple diamond would be the Set of "Purple Shapes"; three outlined green diamonds, two outlined purple diamonds, and one outlined red diamond would be the Set of "Outlined Diamonds." If the player misnames the Set, the next player who slapped "steal" the win by naming the Set correctly. If a player mis-slaps, (s)he is out for the round. With 2-3 players, play continues until 1 player is "out"; with 4 players, play continues until 2 players are "out"; with 5-6 players, play continues until 3 players are "out." Any player who is "out" can slap back in until the game is over. The player who slaps and correctly names a Set gets ALL the cards on the table.

More of an [-]activity[/-] mental workout than a game, but incredibly interesting to take part in.  Whatever it's called I find shifting the mental gears Set requires to be enjoyable even without others and having them there as extra pressure just makes it that more rewarding and fun.

I was really hooked on Set when I first played it, but I've cooled off on it since then.  I think this is because it's really only good between equally matched people.  Also it's not a particularly deep game.  Still, it is tense and exciting in the moment.

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: Be the first to recognize patterns in a group of up laying cards. Collect the most sets by taking them as soon as you see them to win.

Played as: 6 player

Pros: Has everything you need to make a good filler; fast play, easy instructions, and an accessable concept. The speed recognition aspect makes the number of players less important and thus works well with larger groups.

Cons: Has the type of gameplay that is better suited for some minds and would probably frustrate those who don't have a knack for it. 

Other: For five people or less, I can think of some better, more univerally enjoyed filler games. However, for six or more, I can't think of anything else that would fill this niche.

Best Use: A good filler for 6 or more people.

RATING: 7
After thousands of plays, over 20 years, and multiple replacement sets.  

An ur-game that feels so completely perfectly what it is that it seems like it must have been stolen from the platonic realm. 

Despite its autistic repetitiveness, or maybe because of it, I can't get enough.  I play against others, but it's just as fun for me to play solo, and clock the time it takes to get through the deck.  It's become a kind of meditation. 

I don't know anyone who can beat me anymore, so I handicap: you win if you get, say, at least 5 sets before the deck is exhausted (newbies win if they can get a single set).

pattern matching par excellence.  An excellent "I want to play a game" game; start playing and attract people to play with.  

Caveats: much less fun with people much better than you are.  The giveback rule isn't much fun and we usually ignore it.  Addictive.  At high levels, it has annoying race issues.  We usually just play that simultaneous calls (including sets noticed by multiple players prior to the end of a draw) are removed and don't count.

02/08/2013: It's been a long time since we got this out.  I like it, but I am really terrible at it.  There are nine cards displayed on the table and you must get a set of three cards based on color, shape, shading, and quantity.  It's a simple concept, but your brain must be programmed a certain way to do well.  It's inexpensive, quick to play, and very portable.  If you like puzzle games, you may want to take a look at this one.

Set is a game of shape, color, shade recognition.  It forces you to see things in a very different way in order to find the sets.  Kids usually do better than adults as they are not as set in they're ways.

This can be great fun as you watch typical players call "SET" and then drop their head to the table as they realise their mistake. Although it can be frustrating when you find the Rain Man player who just cannot be stopped and never makes mistakes.

I would suggest finding some counters to count for negative points though. I find it much less confusing than removing sets of cards from people. Plus, it allows players to have a score below zero ... and we all want that.

Very challenging and fun.

Since different age groups and personalities excel at different aspects (kids are usually quicker, adults tend to find weirder combinations) this is also playable by most members of the family, despite being a thinking game.

My only grudge with this game is that after one game I don't feel like playing another for a while - it's just too demanding on my limited concentration.

RATING: 3.5
The game Set itself isn't so bad if pattern recognition and fast brain power is your thing. Personally, I'm bad at both and have great difficulty with really thin green/red lines, so I can't play this game so well. If I could say what this game is like, its a bit like Speed and that memory game where you memorize matching pairs, kinda. I still don't like this though.

These types of determine-the-series/pattern recognition games (like Ikarus) just thrill me.  They are small, portable, and quick, making for great play no matter where you go.

Terrific idea, but better for a solitaire or a computer version than for a card game, mainly for mechanical reasons (at drawing a card someone always sees it before the others, it's difficult to tell who calls a set first as well). Apart from that, a new player has got hardly any chance to win against an experienced one.

It's still a clever, very enjoyable game, but due to these unavoidable drawbacks I prefer for instance the solo version against the clock in http://www.highergames.com.

Hmm... a neat game... i think that i'm going to get it, becasue it could be one of the games my wife is naturally better than i am.
to dumb it down, you find set among the available cards...
very easy to teach/learn/play... although you could get frustrated when playing with an expert..


Highly recommended for kids

great starter game to get into the gaming mood... it doesn't seem like winning is a big deal, but for this game it doesn't matter...
also solo mode seems cool, and i here theere is a solo mode in the android market place.

I'm buying this! Thanks PAGE!

[2010/01/28]

Got this game finally, and i love it...

My wife loves it too... In FACT... she puts it in her purse so we can play at the local coffeshop.... and recently when i went to the ER she brought it so i could distract myself while waiting for a doctor... [Set is a great pain distractor]

This game is so phennomally easy to teach... everyone can play... everyone... and the weird thing is that you could go on a roll thinking your the best set player ever... and then you can lose it... and the person you're playing with can start to whoop up... I love it that different people naturally see different sets... 

as brian says: "I can actually feel my brain getting smarter when I play this"

Highly recommended for kids and everyone who loves very light games for very light situations... you can play this anywhere, and there is no pressure... only enjoyment when you yell "SET"

RATING: 5
Totally useless for the colourblind. If you are considering playing this with strangers, please be aware that ~10% of people are incapable of playing it. The manufacturers have a dismissive, arrogant attitude about this. 
If you are considering using this in the classroom, think again. If you think it's worth the purchase price, well... I disagree. And if you think a Mensa Select award means anything, you are an idiot.

Make your own copy with sensible colour choices.

"Set" is OK, but not thrilling- a puzzle, rather than a game.

So far I have played this game only once, and that was in solitaire mode.  I found it much more challenging than I had expected. Even though I understood very clearly the definition of a set, I would sometimes have to study the cards for a long time before I could actually find one.  Once I had found it, I would wonder why I hadn't recognized it immediately!  I like the challenge of Set, but will probably reserve it for solitary play, as it  seems more like a puzzle than a game. The cards are of good quality and the design is excellent--no ambiguity (well, unless you're colorblind). Update: Play with a group was less fun.  The pressure of competition was distracting.  Must reduce my rating.  (3+2) solo plays: 3

Very intelligent game based on pattern recognition.  Object is to find "sets" of 3 based on having Shape, Color, Number, and Shading in common in either all three cards OR none of the cards.  Newbies may find it a challenge at first but then set-discovery becomes easier with multiple plays.

My personal rating for SET would be more like an 8 or 9; I really enjoy it and am quite good at it.  The problem is that this is a "love it or hate it" game, and I've met too many people who just despise it... which means that it's not as good as I'd like, because it doesn't compel people to play as much as I want them to.

Unfortunately this game is exactly the kind of game that I am really bad at. Fighting for last place isn't fun but I can handle that.

I originally rated this game a 2 because I am color blind and thus can not play this game. But after some thought I have had to admit that most people aren't CB. (Do you find it hard to imagine what color blind see? I don't understand what the rest of you people see. How can you call red a bright color? Wierd.) Assuming what most people say, I will accept that this can be a good game. But it sure doesn't "get me".

It's an alright game, there are a few more fun variants to play that I haven't tried like 'Ghost' where you have to figure out what card would complete a 'Set' between two cards randomly drawn from the deck.

It gets quite boring after some time and this one is going to leave you AP for a while unless you play with lots of people who get a good view of the cards.

Beginners have no chance against experienced players and some people just can't find the sets at all.  The biggest problem with this game is that it can make people feel stupid.  Myself included.

RATING: N/A
Kind of hard to talk about this one. It's a speed game where you're scanning a tableau of cards looking for different patterns. That sentence is really all you need to know about it, as people generally know right away if they enjoy that kind of thing, which is usually intimately tied into how well they have that skill. I happen to like that kind of brain-burning "find patterns before someone else does" and quite a few people in my social orbit enjoy it as well. SET is one of the drier games in this genre, and things like Kakerlaken Salat, Ghost Blitz, or Pick a Pig/Pick a Dog are going to be funnier and sillier (and, consequently, they will get played more). But this is a simple, quick, inexpensive, small-footprint game.

RATING: 3.75
An unusual little game, that is actually more of a brain exercise. It is quite interesting but I would not go as far as calling it fun really and there is not a lot of game in there neither. I would have preferred some more hands-on mechanics, turns, time limits, etc., instead of a free-for-all shouting out kind of thing, which might excite some people but it just stresses me out. Also, being good as this game is mostly a question of repetition and pattern recognition and if you cannot afford to have lot of the former and suck at the latter, you are doomed.

i like set. i find it a fun diversion every once in a while. it plays well solitaire. usually i have no interest in playing anything solitaire, but i think this is the one game/puzzle that i prefer to play solitaire and would rather not play with other opponents, just because there's no interaction between players and it isn't very high on the fun factor in the way, say, for sale is. also, the speed factor is pretty unsettling. i play this with my girlfriend, and she can find sets as quickly as new cards are revealed. so opponents need to be evenly matched in ability for this game to be fun and challenging for all players.

Good game, but you need to "train" to be able to compete with an experienced player.  People that have played before definitely have an advantage, unless the new player is just a pattern recognition savant.  That said, I always enjoy playing, even when I get trounced.  It is quick enough that, even when getting beat, I look forward to that next game where I might have a chance.

I first played this game while eating breakfast overlooking a waterfall in the Oregon mountains.  The experience was amazing, which might have bolstered my opinion of it.

I recently played it as a filler game during a game night and did not like it.  If I spent any amount of time playing this game, and got used to looking for these patterns, I'm sure I would be amazingly good at it.  I still don't like it.

Spot the patterns, a set needs three cards for which each characteristic (shape, colour, texture, number) is either the same for all three or different. It is not as easy as it looks, though I suspect smaller children could perform on a par with adults. Possibly of interest as a family game or for a radical change of pace.

We bought this game with our grandchildren in mid and first off, we were ripped off the purchase price by the local toy store. then we read the directions which took no time and started to play with the kids. It did not take long, there was little to think about or even as simple as rolling the dice. Instead it was hit us as an inane and mindless game that was very similar to a Rorscharch Test. Save your money because we didn't!

Hesitate to classify this as a game. To me, a game requires participants to make choices that alter the gamestate for themselves and other players. Set does not have such choices. It's simply an exercise to determine who has the best pattern recognition skills.

A game for the high IQ Club. The rules are very complicated: find a set of three cards that have exactly three same elements plus one different element, or three same elements plus one different element. Everytime a new player plays this he would be either picking the wrong set or picking nothing at all. In practice, the 'one' element has to be the number. You either pick 111 with all different features, or 123 with all same features. Shortcut!

I'm not sure I even consider this a game, but it is a pattern-recognition exercise that I enjoy. The downside is that ability to find patterns varies wildly, and so in any group of 8 random people, probably 1 or 2 of them will dominate the rest of the group. Notably popular among math geeks.

Is really more of a way to kill time than anything else. If playing with more than one person, there aren't many ways to improve play; if you are good at pattern recognition, you'll do well. If not, you'll suck.

RATING: 8
Set is one of those games where the brilliance lies in the simplicity. This game seems to be a favorite of math/spatial people everywhere!

I do have to say, we don't pull this one out as much as we used to, but there was a sequence of months from my past where this game was played literally nonstop.

Pros: 
-Simple concept, fast pace, very portable

Cons:
-Once you have played this game for a while, it becomes easy to quickly spot the sets, so playing with a newbie may be a frustrating experience for them (unless you are holding back). I'd suggest trying to pair people with opponents of the same skill level.
-While you don't "use up" the cards in any way, I do think that the novelty of the game wears off a bit over time, so you may reach a point where you get sick of this game from playing it so much (or maybe that's just me...). In any case, if you get to that point, you can suffice it to say that you've gotten your money's worth out of the game.... and it is still fun to dig out every few months/years, since it is pretty much a classic at this point.

I never play it with anyone, however, since I am exponentially better at it than all but two people since I first learned it; one was my math genius roommate in college, who had a similar reaction time but who naturally saw different sets than I did, and the second a young man who intuitively knew to rearrange the cards left in the tableau while I was filling it back up.

This game is easy right? Just touch the cards faster! Faster!

Gameplay: (2)
If you like the kind of game where you are either 5x better than the other player or 5x worse this is the game for you because that is often what it feels like. On the rare occasion I played this with a person of equal dexterity, it was a fairly close match. 

Overall Fun: (2) 
I just don't really enjoy games that involve doing things quickly I guess.

RATING: 6
Fun enough game of pattern matching. For some people, though, it will be frustrating as you need a certain kind of mind to quickly spot the patterns.

A good warmer.  When I get in a groove, I am hard to beat!  I play this with my gaming group at Glen Innes Library and it's been gratifying to see the kids improve.  

Tip for playing with groups of kids:  don't give them the card sets to hold, rather give them a poker chip or some other token.  Less wear and tear on the cards that way.  Early on, I found that they were yelling "set, set, miss!" whether they really had one or not, so I introduced a chip of a different color to punish these false alarms.  A few weeks of that and now I don't need to use the red chip any more.  They play much more cautiously.

Another way to help them learn is to go around and give each kid two cards, then go back and ask them to describe how the third card to make the set would look.

My girlfriend is freakishly good at this game. It's brutal. As a result, playing this game is completely demoralizing. The goal is to spot sets quickly and accurately. She's good at both. It's very painful, but I consider it dues I have to pay in order to get her to play other games I have some chance of winning. Each card has a shape (oval, diamond, squiggle), color (red, green, blue), fill (empty, solid, lined), and quantity (one, two, three). The cards are layed out face up in a 4 by 3 matrix. A "set" is any three cards that have the same or distinctly different attributes. For example, if all the cards are green, have two triangles on each of them, but each card has a different fill (one is empty, one solid, and one lined), this is a set. The first person to say "Set" picks three cards forming a set and puts them in their pile. The empty spaces are refilled with cards. If everybody is stuck, three more cards are laid out, temporarily increasing the size of the matrix. The game ends when the deck is exhausted, and the winner has the largest pile of sets. It's often possible for multiple sets to exist on the board, and for your opponent to call set and "steal" one of the cards you needed to make your set. This is a rapid pattern recognition game; I suspect you're either good at it or you're not. I make my girlfriend play with a 30 second "shut yer mouth" handicap, so if I can spot a set in the first 30 seconds I get dibs on it...

You either "get" this, or you don't.  I'm usually hopeless at it, as it requires a sort of pattern matching that I don't seem to be able to do.  But for sheer elegance it's hard to beat.

Not a game for everyone, but for the right crowd this one is amazing.  More of a puzzle than a game, it's always amazing to see who dominates this game.  If you get several people who are good at it, it's so fast paced that it's near impossible to keep up.  If you get in a groove, you can call "set" as soon as new cards are put down.  A great game for the collection - I pull this out for people who don't do well with analytical games.  The best player I ever saw was a teen girl who was dyslexic...

Got this game for Christmas from a family member that knew I loved games. It is okay for what it is, I tried teaching my 8 year old how to play thinking at least it would be a learning type game but she wanted nothing to do with this game. I enjoy stretching my brain with this game from time to time but it doesn't make our table often enough.

So I finally found a speed recognition game that made me ask the question "people find this fun?". Who would have thought. 

For me the fun of speed reaction games is all about internalisation of patterns, an ability to be able to holistically look over the task and understand the solution before solving the procedural equation. Well. Set, at least so far, it's ... well it's not a linear solving of puzzles in real time (there's a genre for this as well), so I give it that. But it's kinda trying to get your brain moving but all your cogwheels are not sharing the same plane even, and some match at odd angles. It's all the time jumping in and out, it's pursuing a path in the maze, realising it's probably the wrong one, going somewhere else and then realising the first path was correct. All the while you're paranoid for other people maybe finding solutions faster - it's like a competitive exam! The mix of linear solutions (they all are such), but nonlinear paths to there is interesting, but not sure if holistic. I mean intuition (internalised pattern recognition) "from helicopter view" could help you get started, but then you'll need to check certain paths "on foot"

So... need to try more. But dang it's exhausting. And probably more suited for those who favour linear deduction.

RATING: 7
As an idea and a mental practice, Set is a "10". The idea of trying to make a group where every element either shares a trait or none share a trait is a great challenge. There are many great "a-ha" moments.
As a game, Set can be dry as you are just looking for working groups. Variants of the game might spice it up but also take it away from that great idea. It is a two-edged sword.
I have played the game for 20 years and find it still one of the great mental challenges!

A real brain burner. Great player interaction as each turn is a race to recognize a 'set.' The antithesis of analysis paralysis. Try the daily puzzle on the publishers website to see if you might like it.

RATING: 7
12 cards with different traits (colour, shape, quantity and shading) are placed on the table. Players try to form sets of 3 cards. The catch? Each set must be made out of cards that either have all alike or all different in each attribute.

This isn't really a game so much as it is a visual puzzle. But there is tension as cards are flipped and players agonise as they try to look out for sets.

Some players just do well because they can 'see' the sets but practice makes perfect. Play with players of a similar skill level.

Download the 2 player Get-set variant rules and it will be more of a 'game'.

I love pattern finding. I wouldn't say SET is a game-game... just more of a puzzle. When you play with a group it turns into who can solve the most puzzles. It's also not very interactive or social. Everyone just sits around the game in silence until someone finds a set. Any talking becomes too distracting. 

I guess it works as a really easy filler but it definitely wouldn't fly as the main focus of a game night.

I'm not sure why anyone would want to subject themselves to this kind of torture, but there are those that might consider this fun.

It really feels more like an excercise than a game.  Frankly, I'd rather have one player stare at a card and then have another player try to guess it to see if they are psychic.

More fun to watch other players play, which is exactly what I'm doing when "participating" in this game. 

This could really use an auction variant...

This is a game based entirely on the speed of spotting sets, groups of three cards that are either all the same or all different with respect to color, number, shape, and shading of symbols, independently. It's kind of hard to explain what a set is, but it's very intuitive once you get it. Entirely skill based and not very strategic, which could turn some people off.

We got this game for its educational value of geometric properties of figures to work on our kids' math skills, and it does work out great! It is one of the simplest games to explain, yet tough enough to play -- we actually take turns identifying the patterns rather than rush to be the first to find one. We take it to every major travel we have, as it is one of the smallest boxes in our game closet. I cannot really imagine how they got 6 sets on their explanations picture on the back!

[b]Rules[/b]
- The cards have several characteristics:
1. Shape (oval, diamond, squiggle)
2. Color (red, blue, green)
3. Count (1, 2, or 3 symbols)
4. Shading (hollow, shaded, solid)
- Shuffle the cards. One player places 12 face up on the table.
- Everyone plays simultaneously. Call "SET!" if you see a SET, which is a set of 3 cards that share or don't share each of the characteristics. E.g., they could have the same shape, color, count, but different shadings.
... If you're correct, discard those cards and score a point. Dealer then replaces those cards and play resumes.
... If you're wrong, lose a point; leave those cards in play. 
... If everyone agrees that no SETS are possible, add 3 to the display (come back down to 12 cards as soon as possible).
- Each player deals once through the entire deck. At end, most points wins!

It's a speed pattern recognition game. The rules are fairly simple to understand, but it's still a challenging game. At least, for me -- some people will naturally be very good at this kind of visual pattern processing but I have to think about specific patterns and look at the cards one by one. An OK game, but not much fun for me -- best played by people of similar skill levels!

Why do people like this? Puzzle games have on thing in common with games like Bingo and the Game of Goose: zero decisions. Of course, puzzle games are all skill vs. all luck in Bingo, but still. Maybe some people can feel intelligent when they win this?
If I'm in the mood for a puzzle game, I'd rather play the far superior Ricochet Robots than this dull and repetitive game. The only reason not to give it a 2 is that it's at least somewhat entertaining the first 10 games or so.

[Set Enterprise 1991 edition] {perception, real-time} Set is a challenging real-time mind game. It's nice for children and students to practice their logical thinking. I think it'd be an easy game from reading the rules but after I tried it, I find it's very challenging. Some players will find it very hard to find a set; they need time to practice and to develop their pattern-matching logic.

There will be a "sure winner" unless you can find a group of players with similar intelligence, reaction and pattern-match skill. It seems each player has problem in effectively recognizing 1 particular pattern; esp. when all 4 attributes are different.

I've played this once or twice, but will not rate it because I can't do so fairly: I'm red-green colorblind and have too much trouble telling color-sets apart to be competitive.  So, consider that a word of warning on this game (though I've heard there's a color-blind variant?).

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE: This is totally redundant with what I just wrote, but I want to be super-clear about it: NOT RED-GREEN CB FRIENDLY.  When the shapes are totally filled in, I can distinguish them, but when they're just outlined or patterned, I find it nigh-impossible to tell them apart quickly, and you NEED to be able to do so in a split-second to be competitive.  WHYYYYY can't they make games like this in, say, red/blue/black instead of red/green/blue?  Or red/blue/yellow?  Why choose the MOST COMMON TWO COLORS FOR COLORBLINDNESS to include? ARGH!

Good 'gateway' filler game which is excellent to play with kids in age 4-6 as no reading is involved. Also very suited to family outings. 

If you like this game because of the speed pressure, check out Halli Galli as well. Vice versa, if you like that game but would like something a tad meatier, check this one.

For me: fun to play, but only once. Biggest drawback is that you immediately will know who has better spatial sight and that basically is the game.

Could be really fun if you happen to find someone that exactly matches your skill, but having watched it played a couple of times it seems to suffer this drawback almost always. 

One person will simply be better as the other person in finding combinations, so they will win. And win again. And stop playing it. Therefore, rating is 6 for me personally. Rating goes up by 1 point when viewed from a Family perspective.

Summary: This activity is a great brain teaser. It puts people playing on the brink of mental frustration when several pairs of eyes are looking at the same 12 cards, meanwhile unsuccessfully finding one SET.

RATING: 6
The thinking process involved here is very clever and innovative so my ranking reflects that. As a game, it hardly is a game but rather a repetitive puzzle that you solve over and over and over...There's no end game, there's no strategy, just try to find the matches ASAP. I do like to play it for a few minutes and the thinking is unique. On the down side: there's only one type of thinking involved and it's just a repetitive process, there's no long or short term strategy.

This is the most challenging game of Match that you will ever play.  It's a race to see who can make the most 'sets' in a grouping of 12 face-up cards.  This game is mentally exhausting and feels crazy competitive.  I'm giving this a 7 because some people will simply not do well and not have fun with the game, and I won't always be in the mood to play it since it taxes your concentration.  

That being said, this game is cheap and the concept is not especially difficult.  It feels amazing to be the one to find a match over everyone else, and it feels horrible to miss 3-4 matches in a row.  Definitely try before you buy, but this is an excellent challenge game.  Throw the gauntlet down on your game group and see how their perception skills stack up against yours!

Crazy, brain-bending game of pattern matching. I find I can do really well at it once I'm completely in the zone, but reaching that state of mind takes me a while, and some days I can't get there at all. Certainly one of the most interesting abstract games for general mind-twisting. Play it for too long and you start to see patterns in everything, rather like Tetris.

An elegant pattern recognition game. SET was great as a kid, and I still enjoy it now, though anymore I rarely play it competitively and mostly just use it as a form of solitaire. When you've played enough and have the right sort of focus spotting the sets is automatic, almost like reading.

One downside is that the game isn't much fun where there are radical disparities in skill. It also becomes a bit challenging when played by people of very advanced skill, and I had to add house rules to keep it flowing smoothly in that situation.

About [thing=1198][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=1198][/thing] is a simple card game about pattern recognition - in the same vein as that in Spot It!, but a little harder. The goal is to find more patterns (each one found gives one point) and win the game.

[thing=1198][/thing] is a game about speed in perception and is interactive in the sense that everyone is trying to be faster than the others, but there isn't a way to directly affect someone. It is totally abstract, without presence of luck (if there is "lucky" drawing, it serves everyone) and with some hidden information due to the draw deck.

[thing=1198][/thing] makes for a good game when you want a light option, one in which no one will have to worry about tatics or strategy nor make plans - it is just about looking and seeking patterns. This means that [thing=1198][/thing] can have value in develope or sharp aptitute in pattern recognition).

The production value of the edition I have is weak: the box is flimsy, the sheet for the rules does its job, and the card are serviciable. Replay value is high, as the random nature of the draw makes for different patterns to notice - still, the feel of the game is mostly the same.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Basically: there are four parameters in each card - shape, color, filling and quantity. To form a set a person has to use 3 cards in which every parameter, individualy, is either [i]all the same[/i] or [i]all different[/i].

There will be 12 open cards. However says "Set" first gets a few seconds to point to the three cards that forms a set - if the person is right, she takes the three cards, keeping one (for scoring) and discarding the other two, then three new cards will be drawn and added to the table. If the person is wrong, she will lose one point, and play will proceed normally.

Once the deck is over and there isn't more ways to make sets, the game is over. The person with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Only when say "Set". Is barely a decision, but it is - I say this because, if you see a set, there is no reason not to say "Set" and take the cards. However, if you go too fast and are wrong, losing a point not only harms, but also your mistake gives more time for the others to look for sets.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Portable and easy to carry around;
- Language independent;
- Plays fast and has constant tension;
- Few rules, making teaching and learning them rather quick;
- Can work well for a big range of ages.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Production value, while not bad, is lacking;
- The pacing is uneven: sometimes the play is tense and lively, and in others, is silent, boring and appears almost comes to a halt.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Learning that finding patterns isn't as exciting as Sherlock Holmes, Batman, Robert Langdom, Jeff Goldblum and others lead you to believe. It is usually a dull task - and the reason why [thing=1198][/thing], [thing=63268][/thing], [thing=8098][/thing] and others add rules to make them a race, a matter of quickness in the eye/hand/mouth coordination. [thing=1198][/thing] is a litle more complex due to its four parameters, which can induce to more mistakes and calls for more caution - usually not a good thing when we are talking about naturally boring task made better by being a fast real-time game.

Overall, [thing=1198][/thing] wasn't as enjoyable as others in the genre - it doesn't have big flaws or problems, but also doesn't reach greatness. [thing=1198][/thing] ended up being a little boring, with a sizeable part of the play coming down to staring at the cards in the table, in silence. I would play it again, as it is easy to get into it and the playing time is short enough - but when one of your main reason to play a game is because "is short", you know it doesn't fit your tastes very well.

I make no apologies for loving this game as much as I do.

I loved it when I was first introduced to it at a NYE party a dozen years ago, and I was reminded of how much I loved it when I introduced it to my kids (and many other kids since -- often to the surprise of parents who didn't think their kids were ready for it).

This was a bedtime staple for our family for 6+ months, occupying those last 15-20 minutes between brushing teeth and getting into bed to read books. (Now it's Category 5, but it doesn't compare to how Set was for us before my older son wanted a change of pace.)

And though both my husband and myself are rather accomplished at the game, both our kids were beating us with greater frequency as time went on. We ultimately started playing the 6-cards-in-hand variant which gave us back our edge, but not for long.

One tip for teaching this game? I always explain up front that ANY TWO CARDS CAN MAKE A SET. In fact, with kids as young as 3, I have been able to go through each characteristic, one at a time, for a two-card combo and say, "What color/shape, etc. would the third card have to be for this to be a Set?" 

I found a bunch of these on clearance a year or so ago and bought them all. They are a birthday gift staple, and are always appreciated by the parents of the recipients.

An ingenious mind game, combining logic deduction, pattern matching, memory fetching, and rule verification. Fast paced game (supposed to be). My observation: people with strong logic or command of language can understand the game rules completely in less than a minute. Some people may take two games and shout "Oh, I am starting to know a little bit about the rules". To smart people, Set is a filler game. To others... it is a killer. Learning Set can be a easy tool to falsify those who think smart themselves. By the way, I do sometimes play solitary Set, as kind of meditation, a good way to regain concentration.

Set is more of a competitive math puzzle than a game. I sometimes use the Set website's Daily Puzzle in my 9th grade math classes, and have a deck at school as well. It's fine for that, and if I had an extra deck at home it might make an OK 5 minute filler. But it's nothing to get terribly excited about. Notably, the game is extremely cruel to newbies - practiced players can see sets so quickly that a new player wouldn't even have time enough to start thinking. The red/green colors and quick play also render the game unplayable for the color blind.

Fantastic abstract simple game, where you have to pick out 'sets' from cards. A set consists of three cards which are either all the same or all different in each of four variables. Great game for kids. On the same level as Ghost Blitz, except Ghost Blitz seems to keep kids excited for longer. Though technically, I'd say SET is harder and more challenging. I consider this game a must-have.

This game can be so rewarding and so frustrating at the same time, yet it's so simple and easy to pull out and teach. I like it a lot - but tend to get stress-headaches after playing for 30 minutes or so.

RATING: 5
The premise is simple, but remarkably difficult to get your head around.  This one seems to be one of those games that you either have the knack for, or you don't.  It's almost party-game esque in its ability to expand to as many players as necessary, and allow people to play as long as they want.  A good filler, though can be amazingly discouraging at times when you enter a dry spell.

RATING: 6
One play in a group where other three had played this more or even more before. I got couple of sets, but it took a long to to get the first one. Totally abstract quickness game, with rather simple but actually complex rules. Players try to get three cards from the table, all of the three cards have symbols, which have four different categories, which each can have three different values. To get a set, all of the values in the category need to be exactly same or all different.

Three plays, this can work as a quick filler in proper group. Not my favorite game, but I can play. Not my cup of tea.

It's light but easy to pick up.  Scales from 2-10 players with a come-and-go flexibility that is rare in games.  It is a perfect filler game (since it can be ended any time) and is great for logic/pattern recognition.

A quick dexterity game in which you collect sets of cards through pattern recognition. Requires quick thinking and fast eye movement. Maybe some people find it difficult at first plays. But it's a funny family or party game anyway.
Plus you can play solo for training (and programming your brain for pattern recognition!!!)

This is not a game. This is torture.
This game felt like working on a weekend. There was joy in it at all.

The only thing worse than seeing someone shout "32!" in a game of Ricochet Robot is to hear everyone else in a game of Set yelling "Set!" on a three-second frequency, while you're trying to get a handle on how that one card relates to another.  Either you can do it, or you can't.  I can, but only just barely.

I like this better than most games that have a speed component (in general, I would rather play video games than most speed-is-a-factor board games). It's an interesting twist on the pattern matching style of play. It's also really easy to accidentally "cheat" if you and your opponent are not paying close attention, which erodes some of the mental benefits.

Simple but unique perception game. It's quite brilliant that the rules essentially boil down to one sentence.
The only problem is that it is a bit too fast, if someone has a solution already you can't do much as opposed to Ricochet Robots where you can still search for a better solution.

A favorite, but not as a competitive game. I much prefer playing Set cooperatively, as in "us versus the set." In fact, I've had pretty good luck with this as a party game. I just sat down and started playing; gradually, interested people gathered around and started asking questions. A friend of mine swears by it as a way to make friends of strangers (esp. in coffee shops), but I haven't had the same luck. I have a feeling that her being an attractive young woman might have a little something to do with her success.

This is a love it or hate it experience. Some people are going to be great at this, and others will find it a slog. More of a puzzle challenge than a game, and great activity with kids. I'll play it if my kids ask, or if I feel like they could use a little brain challenge, but not something I would normally choose for my own amusement. Great simple design for what it is.

This is more of an IQ test than a game, as players try to spot patterns and make a claim before all other players. As a result, it feels rather solitary and lacks player interaction. And of course, it lacks a theme as well, which further lowers its attractiveness.

Definitely feels less like a game and more like a brain teaser exercise.  I'd imagine Set would appeal to those into puzzles and pattern recognition conundrums.  Maybe it's because of my OCD tendencies, but I find myself often having to check and double check (and triple check) my answers before claiming my prizes (many times to be snatched up by someone else at the last second), it's almost as if I was taking a test, but only funner.  I like it, but I can't say I will always enjoy playing it.  I guess Set is something that depends heavily on your state of mind in terms of how much pleasure you can get from it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Another little Ravensburger game which we picked up at the same fair, as were we picked up Confusion, and this time it was a nice little game. Not very deep, but just plain fun. Rules are very easy to explain and it could be a nice game to play when you’re waiting for somebody to show up.

RATING: 10
I continue to be amazed by the comparably low rating of SET on here. The rules are simple enough to be explained within one minute, after 5 minutes of showing some examples to new players, the game can begin. There is (usually) no deep strategy, but the game is a test of raw pattern recognition (and by proxy, visually testable formal intelligence). The worst that can be said about this game is that it can feel 'hectic', and that I'm not always in the mood for that. But as a test of intellectual prowess among a bunch of nerds that just met, this game has time and again served its purpose.

Great game, even for two.  I have a feeling multiple players will improve play...as the speed will, no doubt increase.

Really gives a sense of accomplishment when you find a set that's been 'hiding' for a few minutes before anyone else does.

Relatively low rating (for how much I like this kind of game) reflects the fact that I'm not always in the mood to puzzle things out, a requirement in this (somewhat brainy) game and/or sometimes I've been drinking, or my eyes are playing tricks on me...none of which works well with Set.

As a two-player activity, add another .25 to the rating shown.

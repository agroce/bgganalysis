This simple but very good game has won many awards and deserves them all.  Qwirkle Cubes I like even more.

Nice heavy box with lots of tiles.  Rules are clean and very easy to teach.  This game is bad news for the pocketbook of folks that play this for the first time. Right after playing they want to buy their own copy.  I keep an extra copy so they won't have to go to the internet to purchase their own copy and play all that shipping charges.  One of the best games of 2007. Just not a brain burner but instead fun and fast.

Nicely done. The abstract strategy, set collection, tile laying mechanic is well-implemented. The scoring is simple (but does require pencil and paper), and provides interesting choices without being overly complex. Works well with the young and the elderly. That's a win for me.

One niggle... the paint flakes off of the wooden tiles. Not good.

I used to like this more.  I wish it were shorter.  Or maybe I wish it was just a 2 player game.  passing the bag around the table without knocking the tiles around can be a pain with more than 2.

Still, it shines because it's a game that young kids can play with adults.

Great for families, but could induce AP

It would be better if it had less luck. Also the extra points of the Qwirkle discourage players to play a fifth tile all the time and becomes predictable.

Has some charm in a kind of brain-burning/MENSA get- in-the-zone sort of way, plus it looks colourful and the pieces are lovely.  On the other hand, there is a LOT of downtime and it's pretty AP-heavy, for that reason the game can drag at the end. I can see our family playing it a few times in the future, and that's the main thing.  Perhaps repeat plays will speed it up.

Typical of 'Mensa' award winners, this is a tedious and unimaginative game that comes down to luck in the end game. Poor quality (recognizable when face down or in bag) components (made in China).

Ok abstract game, quite interesting mechanics. A bit too much counting is perhaps involved based on the single game I've played. In it everybody felt that you often had to count, whether all of a certain kind of pieces had already been played, in order to prevent creating too good scoring opportunities for others.

Cool abstract game. Kind of like Scrabble but without the letters. Good game to play with kids and adults in the same game since kids are better at the matching aspects of the game (colors and shapes). Nice large wooden pieces. I've used a cribbage board for scoring and that works well but might get confusing with more than two players.

Keep in mind that this is a personal ranking. I won't play this game again. It is not an indictment on the quality of the game in general which I'm sure will appeal to many types of gamers. Qwirkle is a combination of dominoes, Scrabble, and Uno, and takes the dullest parts of each one. You play both the board and the other players, but the board more. It's a game that would become more fun the better you know it, but I can't imagine it would ever become that fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I ranked this so highly due to its simplicity to teach and play and the fast play time. It's also great to take with you on holiday as the bag with tiles does not take up a lot of space or weigh much. 

There is also a surprising amount of strategy, especially when it comes to blocking others from getting a Qwirkle. A very good game!

Very interesting game actually. One wants to compare it to Scrabble, but as a former relatively serious Scrabble player, I think in Qwirkle you really do not spend your mental energy in the same way.

In Scrabble you spend much of your mental energy on vocabulary, spelling, planning on how to use a set roster of two and three letter words...and a ton of time fixating on double letter, triple letter, double word, and triple word spaces.

In Qwirkle, words are irrelevant, there is no roster of two or three letter words, and you do not have designated bonuses to plan for...and around.

Instead, Qwirkle creates its own modest symbol and color vocabulary, and then asks your mind to think in those terms...symbols and colors. You then get to create your own strategies around those terms.

It plays more meditatively, and less intensely as far as I could tell. But those are just my first impressions.

Gutes Familienspiel das eigentlich für fast alle geeignet ist. Die Regeln sind einfach und schnell erklärt. Es gibt zwar am Anfang ein paar Legesituationen die einer Erklärung und kurzen Diskussion bedürfen, aber da hat sich bald geklärt. Das Spiel spielt sich recht ruhig da man sich auf das sich ausweitende Spielfeld und die Aktionen der Mitspieler achten muss. Dabei kann man sich aber immer noch gut miteinander unterhalten (es ist halt kein Schach). Doch ganz planlos sollte man nicht spielen, denn es ist doch schon ärgerlich, wenn man aus Ungeduld eine Vorlage für einen Qwirkle für seine Mitspieler hinlegt. Spaß macht es natürlich wenn man selber einen oder falls  möglich viele eigene Qwirkles mit vielen Punkte angerechnet bekommen kann. Aber auch das erfolgreiche Verhindern von fremden Qwirkles ist befriedigend. Überraschenderweise stellte sich das Spiel als unerwarteter Favorit Silvester 2012 heraus. 
Wie schon häufiger kritisiert sind die Steine bei schummriger Beleuchtung nicht immer eindeutig zu erkennen. Blau und violette sowie rot und orange sind nicht immer und aus jeder Richtung gut auseinander zu halten (auch ohne rot-grün Sehschwäche).
Auf alle Fälle wird das Spiel nicht im Regal (oder besser gesagt im Aufbewahrungsbeutel) verstauben.

RATING: 8
Why often compared to scrabble without words, it is closer toDominoes and Ingenious.  Play and scoring are straight forward and easy to teach making the game a very good gateway game.  While it is an abstract, it does not have the normal dry feel of many abstracts.  There is plenty of luck in the tile draws and it can be tough to set yourself up for future plays, but it is possible.  Keeping track of the pieces already played is key to knowing which plays are possible and thus makes the game more strategic.  Plays well with multiple players, but really shines with just 2.

Nice heavy wooden pieces.  Enjoyable, but it seemed to be too much of a blend of Ingenious crossed with Dominos.  A little too tactical for me, without a lot of depth that I was looking for.  However a good family game, and I think it would be great for playing with kids.  Looking forward to more plays and seeing how my understanding of the game evolves.  Am starting to glimpse how with more experience you start anticipating other's moves and playing to limit their scoring potential.  Have played with 2, but think that it scales well to four.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
At first, I didn't see much in this game; it seemed random and more of an exercise than a game. But then I started to realize that there was more to this game. For instance, learning to not "set-up" your opponent to score qwirkle is a huge part of the game and can make redrawing tiles a strong action. Furthermore, realizing that there are only 3 copies of each tile can create a calculating middle/end-game. Overall, there is meat to this game and interesting decisions to be made. 

Don't get me wrong; this isn't chess or something your going to see super competitive abstract players fawning over. It is a game with drawing and there is a great deal of randomness injected through that mechanic. But, it is also a game that facilitates skillful play. For a simple "beer and pretzel" type of game... it's enjoyable. 

iOS: Definitely recommend the iOS version. Keeping score in the physical game can be a bit tedious and one should play with a sport counter.

Enjoyable game.  Could be an endgame issue with players calculating type of remaining tiles.  Recommend taking out say 4 tiles blind at the beginning of the game.  Some luck with tile draw.  Do you hold back placing five tiles in a row in the hope of getting the fifth and sixth tiles, even though this is unlikely?  And, as it is unlikely there is a little bit of frustration in the game.  It is difficult to imagine that Qwirkle was not inspired by Knizia's Ingenious/Mensa Connection, which I consider a superior game.  Notwithstanding that I am happy to own Qwirkle also, as a sometime alternative.

My girlfriend and I love 2-player Ingenious, so we bought this game (after it won SdJ) assuming Qwirkle has similarities with it.
Qwirkle is more like scrabble (for illiterates?) meets domino: it is a simple, quick and relaxing game, with no "big plays" (like in scrabble), where the tension lays in maximizing the points obtained with every play, without setting up a better play for the next player.
The tiles are big and chunky, and pleasant to manipulate.
The game is definitely aimed to families, but it can play as a quick filler for gamers.
I can see it hitting the table very often in the future...

scrabble for illiterate is a good description. nice and quick, but there is not much to discover here for those that played a lot of scrabble. apply the known tricks, see which scores most points, a little thought given to the possible qwirkles that might appear and if they might benefit you. a bit too simplistic for me...

One of the best games I've played!  The strategy of Scrabble with no words necessary, meaning anyone can pick the game up, and can also pick up on strategy quickly.  But, why I love it:  good strategy can be mitigated by luck of the tiles, and, many times, the winner isn't clear until the very end.

I found this one for cheap at the thrift store. It's a fun game, and my wife likes playing it. It's fun to assess the board and place your tiles to maximize points. This one is light-hearted, or at least we play it that way. We will usually point out a better move if the other player doesn't see it. There's others I'd rather play, but I enjoy it nonetheless.

Nice bits, nice bag, but a game where blocking and setting strategies are immediately too obvious during the first play and the randomness of the draw will eventually decide the winner 99% of the time.

This is a fairly enjoyable twist on the old Scrabble tile-placement system, without the word game aspect added in.  I like that you are not bound to a board and can build as big and wide as you want.  The gameplay also seems to be faster than a traditional Scrabble game, and the placement strategies can be mastered by almost anyone.  The one drawback is that there can sometimes be a runaway leader issue where the winner has been pre-determined and the end-game feels anti-climactic.

There's a real depth of strategy here as players are challenged to place in a way that will optimize points, but avoid setting up another player for a Qwirkle bonus.  For some non-gamers the placement rules can be a little counter-intuitive, but with some practice it will all gel for them.  The best aspect of the game is that any player can pick up on the strategy right away, unlike scrabble where knowledge of trivial words gives an advantage to the experienced player.  Unfortunately the game also offers lots of ways to block your opponents and this competitive edge has frustrated my wife, so I'm not sure how many opportunities I'll have to play in the future.

Qwirkle is a decent game.  Most of the game is about recognizing the best plays to make with the tiles you have available, but there are a few meaningful decisions such as: which move should you make now and which to save for later, and whether or not to make a move that might lead to an opponent gaining points.

(KIDS) I tried this with my kids a few times before and it did not go well.  However, when I played it with just my 4 year old it was a success.  I can now see what makes the game good and I look forward to trying it again.  A second play with my now 5 year old and it was okay.  I see some of the appeal, but overall I don't see enough going on to get too excited.

When I play this game and we get to about the half way mark, I usually start wishing it would end. I think there are too many tiles, and if an opponent gets the analysis paralysis bug, you could be in for a frustrating night.

I don’t like abstracts, so it’s likely my judgement is influenced by my taste, but I think I’m not too far from a shareable opinion when I say that Qwirkle is an outrageously banal game disguised as a deeply cerebral experience: surely the bricks look wonderfully once all of them have been put on the table and form an intricate decoration but this is a bit too little to account for the prominent prizes this game received.

I can’t see where the fun is when playing Qwirkle. (October 2011)

Edit: After further playing it, I still can't stand Qwirkle. Nonetheless, the early aversion has faded and I think it deserves a rating now that fits the game better, thus I raised it from 3 to 5.

I like that this game exists. But I hate how people refer to this as a gateway game. If this qualifies as a gateway game, the term is useless.

A gateway game, by definition, can help introduce someone raised on department-store fare like Scrabble to the wider world of board games. Look, board games can be so much more! And not require you to memorise two-letter word combinations. :)

So a good gateway game introduces new gaming concepts. Not much, to keep the game simple and approachable, but it shows that games can be more than what people have played before.

So tell me how a game that is [i]less[/i] than a game [i]almost everyone has played[/i] could possibly be a gateway to anything.

Qwirkle is Scrabble. I don't know why literally [i]everyone[/i] who talked up this game when it first came out didn't notice that the rules are [i]identical[/i]. I heard in a podcast that the idea came to the designer in a dream, and I immediately asked, "Did she dream about Scrabble? Because that's what she invented."

"Hey, it's not identical to Scrabble!" You're right and you're wrong. The [i]rules[/i] are indeed identical to Scrabble. But picture Scrabble with a board with NO bonus spaces, and the letter tiles no longer have variable values, they're all worth one point. I'm not a Scrabble fan, but even I can see [i]those are the interesting parts[/i]. There's literally nothing new here -- from a gameplay perspective, it's Scrabble with the interesting bits removed. "Hey I see you like Scrabble. You know what game you should try? Scrabble JUNIOR!" Wow, yeah, sign me up.

Having said that and convinced you I'm a miserable human being for pointing this out when noone else will, let me just say that I'm impressed by the fact that you can now play a simpler version of Scrabble without needing to know English well. That's useful, and that's why I said at the start that I'm glad it exists. Now, we can play Scrabble between people with different levels of familiarity with English, so it's better for kids playing with adults for example. I commend the designer for figuring out a way to make Scrabble language-independent. I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but it is, and she deserves kudos.

I'm not blasting her for this creation -- I'm blasting all those board game trendsetters who've been talking up this game as a great gateway game. As a simpler version of Scrabble, it introduces zero new gaming concepts and does not encourage exploration of more games. It's a gateway to a dead-end.

(Having read this, some people will criticise my definition of gateway game. They might say, "Well, any new game that is good will encourage people to play more, and that's a good gateway game." If that's your definition of gateway game, we don't need the term, we already have a good name for that type of game. It's called a "good game".)

Feels like scrabble without all the horrible words :) I loathe letter/word games - but this one is the same 'crossword' type game but uses colours and shapes instead. Works for me - quick, easy to explain. Only downside is the components, it would be so much better if they were resin rather than rather 'rustic' cut wood. 

My son is decidedly lukewarm on this but my daughter loves it (possibly these opinions are related!)

An alright game, but definitely inferior to Ingenious. In Ingenious, you can always do something meaningful with your tiles, but not necessarily in Qwirkle; drawing the wrong tiles can put you in extremely detrimental situations.

Glad to finally play this.  It was about what I expected, making color and shape patterns.  It's still an abstract, and I'm not certain why this one has done so well while others fade.  My wife enjoyed the play more than i did.  I would play this again, but I don't need to own it.

Update: found at a thrift store for $4 so I grabbed it. Might take it up to Maine and leave it there for when we go up.

Kind of fun. Don't see a need to get it, because I can guess it would be played quite a bit at first, and then rarely ever again. But as a relaxing little puzzle at the end of a long day, it's a decent game. I probably wouldn't turn down a game, but not sure I'd request it very often.

A wonderful game.  Much akin to Scrabble, but with symbols.  Powerful moves can be made and there are plenty of opportunities for those nice moments where everyone at the table is surprised by a clever move - cue polite applause.

Altogether excellent, this has seen a lot of success with non-gamers in my group as the rules are approachable, and the game doesn't look daunting.

I'm not a fan of scoring points in a game, but in this game it's bearable, and it's an easy-to-understand part of the strategy of placing your tiles.  Just don't ask me to keep score!  Comparisons to Scrabble are spot-on, but thankfully with the board and words removed.  If you don't have a large table on which to play, opt for Travel Qwirkle, which has tiles about the same size as those from Scrabble.

I'll admit, I knew nothing of this game until it was played on TableTop but it's a strong candidate for taking on holiday or for a light evening at a table. The game is simple and strategic, providing a nice balance of playing and planning, which is something I look for in a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great game, great components.  Much more enjoyable then Ingenious in my opinion.  I think the sweet spot for this game is 2 or 3 players, since it's much more tactical and the downtime increases with player additions due to re-evaluations of the board after everytime someone plays.  

Regardless, the rules are simple, there are real decisions, and there's healthy dose of luck.

Update:  I've come way down on this game since I first played it.  I think it's very easy for all players to play with an ideal strategy, and it all comes down to luck of the draw.  I think it's a great kids game, but I won't be asking for this game to come out anymore. =/

This is an excellent family game that feels a bit like Scrabble, but with out the arguments over the legality of plays. The components are also top notch. I wonder why the number of players is limited to 4? Down time is minimal enough such that it seems like Qwirkle should work well with up to at least 6 players.

What do you do when there are no more possible plays because the players have created a compact 6x6 square that cannot be extended in any direction?

Clever game.  Those who describe it as Scrabble with shapes and colors are right on target.  I've only played two games so my rating is tentative.  The somewhat low rating reflects my worry about replayability -- I can imagine each game feeling similar (much more similar than repeated games of Scrabble, say).  I was hoping my 7 year old daughter would get taken with this game but she seems just OK with it so far.

RATING: 3
This game did absolutely nothing for me. It's more pattern-matching exercise than game, really - very similar in look to Eifach Genial/Ingenious, but without the Knizian attention to balance, playtime, subtlety, and, like, making an interesting game. I've heard it compared to Scrabble, Set, and Ingenious, or some blend of these titles, but only the Set comparison is really valid (the rest are, in my opinion, completely inappropriate). I find it more similar to Carcassonne - looking for optimal tile placements that don't open up too much for your opponents - but even Carcassonne had more subtlety and interest than this. It's also much too long for what little is going on here, and egregiously prone to analysis paralysis amongst those so inclined (especially problematic in light of a scoring scheme which has a very high luck factor).

Give me Blokus, Ingenious, Khet, Lost Cities, Blue Moon, or even Rumis - not to mention anything in the GIPF line, like the simpler ZERTZ or DVONN - any day over this.

Now, after just trashing it, I can see Qwirkle might have a nice niche as a kid's game or a family game for adults and younger kids.

Winning this game is 90% luck dependent.  For non-gamers, they can figure out the entire strategy within a game or two.  For gamers, they can figure it out within about 6 turns.  Scrabble-like mechanic without the actual scrabble skills of making words of different lengths to help or hinder the collection of bonus points on a scrabble board.

This is a nice activity to play with young children or total non-gamers but, it won't hold a gamers interest beyond one or two plays.

Scrabble for illiterates (not for the colorblind though...is this a Breese game?  Sorry, colorblind joke).  I was expecting more from the hand management mechanic of this game.  It seems like the players aren't trying to do the best with what they have drawn, but instead are hoping they draw what the board calls for.  That definitely detracts from what is really an interesting concept.

RATING: 6
A pretty good abstract game like Ingenious. I really like how you can block other people from making qwirkles by clever tile placement, and I love when people set me up for qwirkles... Qwirkle is one of the better pure abstract games which are NOT brain burning (like Yinsh etc. is), though I prefer Ingenious when looking for an easy, abstract game to play. 

Qwirkle is definitely not without faults, though. It can drag a little and become too long for what it offers in terms of gameplay. Placements are often obvious, and there is a huge amount of luck involved in the tile drawing. Also, because people don't want to place the 5th tile in order to avoid setting others up for a "Qwirkle", people tend to wait until they can lay down every tile themselves - and this is where the luck in the tile drawings might have a too big impact. Still, it's a good family game and my wife likes it quite a bit.

My wife and I play it mostly as a 2p game now, and as we're of equal skill levels, the last games have all been decided and won by the person who ended the game; and then it's not really an enjoyable 30 minutes when it comes down to that.

Well I'll be darned, Qwirkle is pretty good! I wasn't terribly enthusiastic to play this game. Heck, it sits on the shelf in Target next to all the other mundane classics, but after playing this once, I gotta say a game of Qwirkle is enjoyable.

Like Blokus, or Hey That's My Fish, Qwirkle is incredibly approachable, abstract, and challenging with enough decisions. I like it a little less than those other two titles due to a bit of AP that seems to occur, but overall I'd gladly play this again.

An easy-to-learn abstract reasoning and pattern processing style board game similar in rules to scrabble.  It takes 1-2 minutes to teach.  There is some luck involved, but not enough to keep the people better at abstract and tactical thinking from winning over people not as good.  Your own talent in that regard will be more important than someone else's experience in the game.  The game lasts about 30 minutes.  It won't give you that satisfied feeling some other board games give, but it's a nice casual game to pass the time with.

I picked it up for my daughter who loves Set. Sure enough, she liked this too. Unfortunately, however, I disliked this even more than I dislike Set. At least in Set the randomness affects all players equally. In this game there are certain tiles that become super valuable from trivial plays. Whoever gets it/them, does better. You can also try to be clever, and not make the penultimate play to set that up, hoping to instead make the full play yourself, but you're still at the whim of getting the tile you need, and clogging your hand. Ingenious is sooooooo much better.

Abstract game similar to Scrabble in that you take tiles and lay them in the same format. Goal is to get 6 of the same shape in all different colors or each of the 6 shapes in the same color all in a line, as that scores you double points. Pretty entertaining, very simple to teach, overall solid game.

Ok shape matching, scrabble like game. 

Dec. 2016: Just played another round and realized this just isn't my kind of game.  Didn't find it very fun as scoring is slow and boring and strategy of minimal.  Played 4 times.

I only don't like the starting rule.  Going first is a disadvantage.  You rarely score well, better to go second. Or even better , the first player should receive some extra points, lake the last play of the game.

Components: A bit garish, but easy to distinguish the colors and shapes. The tiles are too hefty. It makes them free-standing, which is nice, but the game could be smaller, lighter, and more portable with Carcassonne-like tiles.

Experience: Definitely a Scrabble-esque rack-management quality, whereby I am trying to maximize my score from turn to turn, but also keep a steady stream of tiles flowing through my hand, increasing my chance for having a bonus scoring opportunity. Simple and pleasing.

I was a little disappointed by the shallowness of the strategy. It seems you can make a bum's rush for maximum scoring, or you can play defensively (blocking), but not both, and not that playing defensively really has any demonstrable impact on the game - you're as likely to leave something else open in the process as not, or at the very least, reducing your own score for the game. Counting tiles, and using those counts, is probably the extent to which this game offers strategy.

I think as a gateway game, you can do better. It might be uniquely suited to "weaning" Scrabble players, but I don't find it as fun or engaging as Ticket to Ride, for instance.

Love the tactile aspect--there's a great feel to the chunky wooden tiles.

The game is okay.  There is thinking and planning involved, even though you're just dealing with shapes and colors.  It's more approachable than Scrabble, but has a competitive scoring element that makes it better than games of similar ilk.

Just not my "thing," though.

I pleasant enough filler in the vein of dominoes or Ingenious. Select tile, place tile to earn points, not giving away too much to others, replace tile.
There is a nice spatial-puzzle aspect to it where you can lock out other player's options or kill a possible 6 sequence with a well placed tile.
But ultimately a pretty light filler for us.

We must be missing something, because this game has super high ratings everywhere I look. We have tried playing it, but it's hella boring! It's too simple, and you have to play on a humongous table in order to keep playing. Also, it's impossible to keep the pieces in straight rows (for us clods, anyway). And counting points got confusing for us as well. I guess I'll try reading the directions again. I just have a really hard time understanding why this game is so loved!

Players take turns melding blocks to the table, building up a Scrabble like game board, and accumulating victory points.  Pleasant, if rather long, game.  Players maintain a hand of six blocks, each block having a one of six symbols in one of six colours on it.  There are three of each symbol/colour combination.  Melds can be all in the same symbol or all in the same colour, and must connect onto existing melds on the table, possibly creating new lines and/or extending existing lines.  Points are awarded for each line created/extended, with a "Qwirkle" bonus for a line of six tiles.  I found this one to be quite mediocre, but harmless enough to break out when in the mood for something mindless.  Too long, and rather derivative of other games out there - Ingenious is much tighter, quicker, and simply better.

RATING: 4
Not much strategy here.  The best move is almost always to get the maximum points now, and block any possible future "quirkles".  The changes of you getting the right tiles to "quirkle" is always worse than one of your opponents (even head to head, they may have it in their hand, plus you each have an equal chance to draw it).  The saving grace here for owning this is that my 2 year old daughter loves to play a matching game with the cool wooden tiles.

In my first 2-player game, I felt pleasant tension when holding back on a play in hopes of drawing more tiles to make a qwirkle on a future turn. Points did accelerate later in the game due to the possibility of more qwirkles, which would seem to allow for endgame tension. But I ran away with the lead and couldn't be caught because I kept drawing the exact tiles needed for qwirkles several times in a row. That was less than satisfying: it didn't feel like taking risks that paid off, it felt like luck.

I own the qwirkle travel.

[b]Components wise[/b], tiles are made from wood, like in the normal/standard version. Before I got the game, I was worries that the tiles may be too small. But after several plays, the size is right for me, especially for a travel size. However my mom did complaint once about the small size which was a little hard for her to see.

You're supposed (as the rule suggested) to stand the tiles but since it was a little small for my mom to see, I gave her a player screen so that she can lay the tiles on it's back for a better view. I will have to make a custom player screen that fits in the box so that I can bring it along when traveling.

Qwirkle is a great game and the travel edition is even better because as nice as the big-boy edition is with its giant blocks, it's all rather unnecessary.  The travel edition comes with a nicely-crafted nylon bag and extra ornamental Qwirkle piece as a zipper decoration while being light as a feather.  It's the exact same game as the normal game, just on a smaller scale with typical Scrabble-sized tiles instead of the giant blocks.  Another bonus is that because the pieces are smaller, you have an equally smaller footprint on your table.

With this edition of the game available, I don't really see any reason for anyone to go with the big edition, unless they're getting it as part of Qwirkle Trio.  The travel edition is a good 40% cheaper than the big edition and doesn't miss a thing.

This is a fun, light-weight, abstract game.  There is a good dose of luck as you draw tiles from a bag to replace the ones you've played, so people who dislike luck should be aware.  Some can argue that the game just boils down to figuring out the optimal choice you have based on what tiles you have in your hand and what has been played.  However, I believe there are still choices to be made because you need to choose between optimizing points for yourself or strategically blocking opponents from potentially gaining a qwirkle (large point bonus).  Our group enjoys it and we play it quite a bit.

Qwirkle was a big surprise.  I expected that it would be a good game to play with my daughter.  What I didn't expect was that my wife and I would find it so engrossing, given it seemed on the surface to be a less complex version of scrabble.  However, the challenge of thinking in colours and spatially as well the excitement of pulling off great moves brought our competitive instincts and made it really enjoyable.  

(Wife rating - 8)
(11 year old daughter rating - 8)

A fun tile laying game that does not outstay its welcome. Always a good game to introduce to new players, although the colours are just terrible for the colourblind.

RATING: 8
Pretty fun with three.  Probably a very good game for two.  While the tiles are wooden, which is a plus to me, the overall quality is so-so.  One tile came cracked and the shapes on a number of others are poorly painted.  Maybe it is to be expected from a game with over one-hundred wooden tiles with an SRP of about $25.  The same game made in Germany would be at least $35-40 while the same game made in the US would be sent over-seas...which it has been...which is why we're having this discussion.

Once all players know what they are doing and don't set other players up for high-point plays (i.e. qwirkels) the game really does really on the luck of the draw (more so that Carcassonne as there are way less combinations / situations in Qwirkel).
I am afraid the game lacks in depth. A remedy might be playing the game with open tiles, but I would only recommend that in a 2-player game because otherwise the game would take way too long. 

The 2-player game comes down to luck of the draw with experienced players.
The 3-player game hits my wives sweet spot
The 4-player game hits my sweet spot, but my wife thinks the the downtimes for the individual players are to long (if every player takes 3 min., a player gets to play only every 9 min.)

I have recently learned this game, and I don't know why but I want to play it ALL the time. I can't get enough of playing it at home because we have other games to play as well, so I play online against the computer at www.ultraqwirkle.com when I have a free 10-15 mins. Whenever there is only time for just a short quick game with not a lot of setup, I reach for the handy zip storage case which also serves as the draw bag, and we are ready to go. A great game for 2 with a simple ruleset and elegant gameplay. I like it as much as I do Ingenious.

Enjoy this game.  Not overly simple, but not too deep.  Usually can teach someone HOW to play in a few minutes, but it usually takes at least a few games before you start to realize how to deny Qwirkles, how to determine whether the risk of setting someone else up for a Qwirkle is low or high, and how to pace out your tiles so that you're the most likely to be the first to use all your tiles for the 6 bonus points.  Simple, fun game!

I played this after playing Qwirkle Cubes. I see why this game is interesting to people who don't play a lot of games because it's pretty simple to understand, but for me it is much less interesting than Qwirkle Cubes. In Qwirkle Cubes you can change the symbol given to you by rolling the dice, offering many more possibilities for scoring. It's also easier to help others (such as my kids) play Qwirkle Cubes since everything is visible. So I have no reason to play the regular Qwirkle.

Qwirkle (played with tiles) is more strategic than Qwirkle Cubes (played with dice). Both draw from a bag and each player places according to the same rules. 

The difference is, with Qwirkle you know exactly what your opponent has for their next turn and if you can, you might chose to block a high-scoring placement of his instead of scoring more for yourself. In Qwirkle Cubes, a person at the beginning of their turn can choose any number of dice to re-roll. You just hope they don't roll anything good in the. In Qwirkle you have more control of the game; Qwirkle Cubes, has far more luck.

My family, if they will play at all, prefer Qwirkle Cubes. I myself enjoy more strategic games, and I particularly dislike dice games, so I should prefer this original Qwirkle, but not so. It comes down to aesthetics. I just like the look and feel of Qwirkle Cubes. The Qwirkle tiles are quality--wood, large, colorful, nicely finished; and so are the Dice. The dice game just has a better physical appearance and the dice feel good in the hand and on the roll.

Basically, its scrabble without the board, except you match colors and shapes to each other instead of trying to make words.  Fun little game.  If you always wanted to like scrabble but kept getting your butt kicked by people with much larger vocabularies, you'll probably really like this.  You don't even need to be able to read to play.

Also, I may be the only person in the world that actually knows this, but the little wooden tiles actually make great coals.  They give great heat for quite a long time.  Not like actual charcoal, mind you, but they'll work in a pinch.

Qwirkle 碰碰棋 2-4(4)
At first I thought: "Gosh, who is going to play this abstract look-no-fun-block-of-wood game?" Then somewhere in time I was looking for games that can be played with elderly, and on recommendation forum Qwirkle kept popping up. So I gave it a whirl and OMG it was like me struck with gold. I have played it with my parents and even my friends and it just works like a charm. On your turn you either play or trade, it's that simple. With experience you will see trading as a more essential part of winning. I had tried with different house rules on scoring and hand size, but eventually turn back to the original rule as we believe is the best for blocking. There is some tactical thinking involved but luck still plays a factor to your tile drawing and sometimes it may be frustrating for those fall behind. I consider Qwirkle one of the best for BG gateway entry.

Extrapolating from one game is foolish, but my guess is that the winner of most games gets handed several 6-point bonuses due to luck of the draw.

Played again several years later.  Yep - seems like a fairly-typical, luck-based, abstract family game.  Gains half a point for chunky colorful tiles and a box that holds them perfectly.

Gains another half point because my kids (7 and 5) really enjoyed it.  5 year old struggled to visualize good moves.

Qwirkle is roughly in the same wheelhouse as Ingenious or maybe even Blokus but in my eyes strictly inferior to both. Placements are very obvious and the big points are usually made by those drawing the right tiles at the right time. The game of chicken of not wanting to place the fifth tile in a row is also quite uninteresting because it just means everyone is waiting until they have both the fifth and sixth tile.

The gameplay reminds me of Scrabble, which makes me wish I was playing Scrabble instead. The concept is fun and different as it engages the brain on the color and shape level. My main problem with Qwirkle is that it drags on a bit long for a game with almost no strategy. While it is certainly possible to get a leg up through a bit of strategy, it is also often the case that lucky drawing carries the day. I want to like this game more, but something about it is just not satisfying.

I love this game.  My whole family can play it.  There is usually one player out in the front on scoring but the rest are together.  My husband who is rarely out in the front thinks it's all luck but I say it's more strategy than he thinks.  (Yes, I'm usually the one out in the front.)  Fun game the kids like & can really hold their own.

This is a good family abstract game, that plays quick and has a good amount of depth to it. Be wary of playing with people who suffer from AP. Players are trying to score lines of either colors or shapes. By game end, it will look like a cross word puzzle.

The blocks are wooden and of nice quality and the game is easy to teach/learn in just a few minutes. The game also plays fairly quick, depending on how long it takes players to take their turn.

I have played Qwirkle a dozen times now and have a good idea of all of the game's attributes. I hope to convey what I learned about the game so that you will know if it is a game you might like to add to your collection.The first thing you will notice about the game is that the box is heavy and contains lots of high quality wooden pieces. The shiny, black, 'one inch square', wooden pieces look and feel good. I was a little concerned that there might be a wear issue because the pieces get shuffled face down in a mahjongg style, but after lots of shuffling with my set, I absolutely see no signs of wear being a problem.The game is quick to teach and learn. New players may be at small disadvantage against experienced players, but everyone seems to fully understand after a game or two. The games are quick and so this learning curve is really nothing to worry about.Game play:Printed on one side of each black tile is one of six shapes. The shapes are each printed in one of the six, easily distinguishable, colors. That gives you thirty-six different combinations e.g., blue square or yellow circle. There are three set of tiles for a grand total of one hundred and eight (108) pieces.All players start by drawing six tiles and the player who has the most tiles sharing a single attribute starts the game by playing all of those tiles in a row or column. (Example: three orange tiles) The next player plays by playing one to six tiles, which share an attribute, in a single line, attached to tiles that were played earlier; think Scrabble. This concept of 'played in a line' is the trickiest part of the rules. All of the pieces played on a turn must be played in a single row or column and there may be no breaks between tiles you play; and yet, the tiles you play need not touch each other. Lost yet? I's not that hard; again think Scrabble. You can add to both the beginning and end of the same word on your turn e.g., in Scrabble you can change "corn" into "acorns" Every row and column, of touching tiles, may only have one attribute in common such as all are circles of different colors or all are orange with different shapes. Players 'refill' back up to six tiles in hand after making their play. Points are awarded based on every line you have added to, once again scoring is very Scrabble-ish. There is a bonus for putting the sixth touching tile in a line. The grid of tiles gets larger and larger as the game continues until the game ends when the draw pile is exhausted and one of the players runs out of tiles in hand.Questions:There are only [-]a couple of[/-] one small ambiguitie[-]s[/-] in the rules. Often the start player cannot play all of the tiles they have that share an attribute as the rules state e.g., three red circles cannot be played together. We tweaked the rule to be; the player who has the most tiles that can be played in a single touching line starts the game by playing all of those tiles. A visual example of the "acorns" rule would also help out the rules lawyers out there. There are plenty of visual examples in the rules covering all elements of placement and scoring [-]with only that single omission.[/-] [b]The game's rules include an example of the "acorns" rule, I just missed it some how.[/b]Conclusions:This game has lots of things going for it. The first time I played the game was on a bed and it worked very well in that setting, and not many games can make that claim. There's enough strategy to keep players engaged during the game, but you would never call this a brain burner or chess like. The strategies are mostly making sure that you don't set up the other players for a big score, holding on to tiles that may let you make a big score later and, when and if you want to discard your old tiles and draw new. This last option is good if you are stuck with bad tiles or you are searching for a tile that is playable for a big score. With experienced players, much of the game becomes defensive. You don't have the tile that plays in that high scoring plum of a spot and your opponents might. Your best play is often to play a tile or tiles that impinge on that spot to spoil it for the other players.I have found that one of the hardest things about this game is finding it. None of the major on-line game retailers have the game right now. Luckily for me, I had a friend who lent me his copy to play for a while. Soon, I'll need to give it back and that will be a sad day for me. I think this game is a 'definite buy' and Qwirkle will be in my next game order, as soon as I can find someone selling it.

Simple game to teach but hard to master. Hours and hours of fun with a small game you can take with you and play almost anywhere. 
Requires a lot of strategical thinking, anticipation and some luck drawing the tiles. Can be played from 2 to 4 players, games will always be different.

As a side note, you can hold your pieces vertically on a table (similar to dominoes but smaller) or you can use the tile holders for games like Scrabble to hold and move the pieces as you like (it almost seams the Scrabble holders have been made for this).

I enjoy this game more the more times I play it. Simple to learn, and not too lengthy to play out. Strategy is somewhat irrelevant as random tile selection combined with opponents plays can destroy and planned move. Better to optimise your plays on a move-by-move basis.

The design of Qwirkle is fine. It is in league with many of the abstract games that I like, with simple rules, opportunities for surprising moves, and meaningful decisions. The game is just not fun for my husband and me. We think the problem is in the components. In our copy, it's really hard to tell the difference between red and yellow, and between blue and purple. Worse, the gloss finish on the blocks creates glare that makes it hard to see shapes as well as colors. We felt a constant strain trying to recognize the tiles in our hands and on the table. With these flaws uncorrected, we rate it a 5 and decided to move it out of our owned games collection. For a copy that does not have these flaws, we would rate the game a 6. We could probably correct the flaws with some markers or paint and some matte spray finish, but we don't want to expend the effort.

Scrabble without words, but at the same time a bit more brain burning (not a lot, though). Easy rules, good components and the travel edition comes with a nice handy pouch. Non-gamers should like this one.

Qwirkle will appeal to someone who likes Ingenious (Einfach Genial), but would enjoy having a game that's more puzzle-y with opportunities for blocking and combinations a la Scrabble.  I originally thought that it might be a good game for casual/non-gamers, but I've found that it works better as a light game for gamers, because it's actually a little trickier than it looks.  Qwirkle is probably also a good choice for anyone who likes Scrabble or Dominoes or similar old-school parlor games.

I'm giving Qwirkle a strong recommendation, considering its many assets: the classic parlor game feel, the ease of play, the pleasingly bright and chunky tiles, and a very, very low price.

The game is light and easy, and definitely fun. I worry that it might be too light, and lose its appeal quickly. However, I'll reserve final judgment until I've experienced it with more players. It is definitely a game that would be enjoyable with younger players. 

**UPDATE** I've played it now with 2, 3, and 4. It is a light, fun game, however my repeated plays have really shown how much LUCK is a factor. Because the game is so light and generally quick, that's not really a terrible thing. However, it can be extremely frustrating if you're just not drawing the right tiles. In Scrabble if you draw poor tiles, it is up to your vocabulary and ingenuity to make worthwhile plays. In Qwirkle when this happens, your options are constrained by the board, not your skill.

Is an interesting set matching game, with some tactical thinking required when playing with gamers. Using thick wooden tiles, play to match shapes or colors in a row or column.

The game is very easy to learn and play, but it does require some planning and tactics.  Mostly, it is a game of opportunity and observation, as players should try to spot the plays that will earn them the most points.  However, care must be exercised to insure that one’s placements do not provide bonus opportunities for the next player.  Further, it may also be wise to conserve a tile or two if they will likely be able to be used later in the game to complete lines and earn bonuses.  

Fans of Reiner Knizia’s popular Ingenious will find much to enjoy here.  Ingenious puts a bit more pressure on the players, as the board is fixed, so players can play aggressively to block their opponents.  Since there is no fixed board in Qwirkle, the playing area expands without limit (well, perhaps the edge of the table is a limit!), so blocking an opponent is more difficult. 

Strategies aren’t numerous, with the main tactic is placing tiles to maximize your scores, which will often involve either completing a line of six tiles, and/or placing a tile so it can score in two or more lines.  Due to the free-form nature of the board, blocking is a tougher task.  While seasoned gamers searching for deep strategies and mind-bending options will likely not be satisfied, Qwirkle is an ideal game to play with families and friends.

Ahogy mi nevezzük: Scrabble mérnököknek. :)
Könnyen tanulható szabályok, ráadásul a travel verzió kis helyen el is fér. Alapvetően taktikai játék, azonban a szerencse szerepe sem elhanyagolható. Természetesen, ahogy a játék halad előre annál nehezebb megtalálni a legjobb megoldást megszerezve a legtöbb pontot.
Leginkább 3-4 fővel ajánlanám, mivel úgy a leggyorsabb a legkevesebb holtidővel.
Érdemes figyelni, hogy a lapkákból 3-3 db van a játékban és ennek megfelelően tartalékolni egy 6-os sorhoz. Csak a végső esetben egészíts ki egy sort 5 darabosra, mert a keselyűk gyorsan lecsapnak. :)

Qwirkle es un juego en el que formamos un crucigrama de formas y colores y vamos puntuando por ello. Recuerda al Scrable y al genial de Knizia. Es un juego de iniciación ideal para no jugones y para jugar con toda la familia, los componentes del juego hacen que entren por los ojos de cualquiera.  Para mi de este tipo hay juegos mucho mejores como el Genial o el Blokus por poner solo dos ejemplos. Qwirkle no tiene demasiada estrategia y la poca que tiene es poco profunda, simplemente intentas optimizar la colocación de tus fichas lo máximo posible lo que hace que hacia el final de la partida el juego provoque análisis parálisis porque las fichas están muy extendidas y hay que hacer muchas mas cuentas.
En resumen es un juego ideal para familias y no jugones por su escasa dificultad y los componentes que entran por los ojos. Para jugones hay alternativas mejores que evitan ese AP de una forma mucho mas elegante, es un juego ideal para regalar.

Basically Scrabble without the board and no spelling.  The game is not bad, but not great.  It is a good game for non gamers and for families.  However, there is fairly little strategy and much is based on luck.

It's similar to Scrabble in terms of the tile placement, but removes the "trivia" aspect that I dislike so much. You spend a lot of time shuffling your tiles around and making decisions about whether to take more points or play more tiles (not as easy as it sounds). It has very nice chunky wooden tiles that give a great tactile sensation and look pretty on the table. For the price, it's a good value in terms of components. 

In the gameplay, there are definite decisions to make, but they are usually of the "take points now or take a chance at lots of points later" variety. Played with a competent group of players, it is relatively easy to defend against Qwirkles (which score double points), but a novice could certainly give the game away if not playing this way. Ultimately, there is not a lot of depth, but it is a very relaxing game that still gives you the satisfaction of feeling that you played well when you win.

A board-less scrabble (like Bananagrams) but with a shape-colour grammar. Certainly an interesting and generally accessible abstract. I believe that if you are only to have one game that fits this category, that Ingenious (which was also a Mensa select) does it better. However, this game is still distinct enough to merit playing should this be a genre that really floats your boat.

RATING: 7
A great characteristic-matching game. To shake things up a bit, we play with a house rule that legal plays can have gaps in them, as long as all tiles still share one characteristic (color or shape). This makes for a bit more dynamic play as the board gets larger, and we've found it to decrease the overall chances of people getting Qwirkles (6 contiguous tiles). Also, there's no real reason why this can't be played with 5 people, other than perhaps a bit too much downtime.

Kinda halfway between Ingenious and Carcassonne.  The moves can be a little obvious sometimes, especially with lucky draws.

Can definitely see it becoming a true evergreen game.

Less complicated (and more colorful) than Scrabble, this tile laying/set completion game is light enough for kids, but challenging enouhg for adults as well.

You don't get the joy of unscrambling a 7-letter word from a list random letters; the feel is more one of luck/planning when you can play a tile(s) to finish a line or column of 6 tiles & complete a qwirkle for bonus points.

After a couple plays I'm starting his at a 6.5.

After one play, this is a typical 6 for me. I was not impressed by the endgame especially - there are too many possibilities with just one or two points difference, which means long thinking with no real impact on the final scores. I don't see how a runaway leader will be stopped - our results were in after less than half the game. Changes in luck might have changed it. Would try again, but there are usually other games I am more eager to play.

RATING: 6
“Technology gets better everyday. That's fine. But most of the time all you need is a stick of gum, a pocket knife and a smile." – Nathan Muir

GAMEPLAY
Simple and engaging is the best two word explanation of Qwirkle. Players have a hand of 6 tiles played in turn to a central area building out like a crossword puzzle. There are 108 tiles in the game with 6 different shapes and colors. A tile must be placed next to a like tile either color or shape. More tiles in the row played scores more points including an extra 6 when the sixth color or shape is played for a “Qwirkle.” Scores are tallied throughout play and totaled once a player is unable to pull more tiles from the bag. Gameplay is great fun for children to develop pattern recognition.
COMPONENTS
The tiles are all solid wood painted black with the six primary and secondary colors on them. They are easy to hold and hide and the colors are bright and easy to differentiate. Tiles are stored in a drawstring sack in the box. This was a simple and excellent choice as it is easy and fun to mix up the tiles and everyone can pass it around the table.
THEME
There is no theme. It is unimportant to the experience.
WHO IS IT FOR?
Qwirkle is great for groups of younger kids 6 and up and families with children.

Qwirklet 2011-ben az év játékának választották Németországban (Spiel des Jahres), aminek jogosságát erőteljesen vitatják társasjáték körökben, egy olyan évben, amikor akár a 7wonders (bár külön kategóriában indult, nyugodtan lehetett volna itt indítani) akár az Asara megkaphatta volna e címet. 
A Qwirkle  a scrabble és dominó egyfajta keveréke. A játék lényege szín és forma sorozatok készítése és kiegészítése, úgy, hogy a legtöbb pontszámot tudjuk elnyerni.

A játék nagyon egyszerű. Minden játékos 6 db elemet húz a zsákból, amit nem mutatnak meg egymásnak. Az a játékos kezd aki a leghosszabb szín vagy forma sorozatot tudja elsőre kirakni. A játékosok az óramutató járásával egyezően követik egymást.
A játékos két dolog közül választhatsz:
1.	Hozzáad egy vagy több elemet az asztalon lévőkhöz és utána annyit húz a zsákból, hogy újra hat darab legyen a játékos előtt.
2.	Becserélheti akár az összes elemet új elemekre.
Minden elemnek kapcsolódnia kell egy sorozathoz. Egy sorozat mindig egy adott színből de különböző formákból áll vagy egy adott formából áll, de különböző színekből. Egy forma sorozatban egy színből csak egy darab lehet, egy szín sorozatban két egyforma forma nem lehet. Egy sorozat maximum hat tagból állhat.  
A játékosok annyi pontot kapnak, amennyi elem van egy általuk felépített sorozatban, tehát ha  kiegészítenek egy adott sorozatot akkor azért az egész sorozat értékét megkapják. +6 pont jár annak a játékosnak aki egy 6-os sorozatot befejez. Ezt nevezik "Qwirkle"-nek. A "Qwirkle" 12 pontot ér, 6 a sorozatért + 6 bónusz. 
Amikor elfogynak a zsákból az elemek a játék addig folytatódik amíg valaki ki nem rakja a kezében lévő összes elemet. Aki először lerakja az összes lapját + 6 pontot kap. Az a játékos lesz a nyertes aki a legtöbb pontot össze tudja gyűjteni.
Színes, könnyed, egyszerű játék, nagy szerencsefaktorral. A taktikai elem a játékban inkább csak az, hogy a másiknak keresztbe tudunk tenni. Könnyű játék, amelyet a gyerekek is gyorsan átlátnak, ezért családi körben is jó szórakozás lehet. Ha tudomásul vesszük, hogy a játékban sikerességünk javarészt attól függ, miket húzunk fel, illetve ki után következünk, akkor felnőttek és gyakorlott társasozóknak is jó szórakozás lehet ez a könnyed játék.

Games as obviously derivative as this aren't usually as good as those they try to emulate, but this is a rare example of one that equals its progenitor. An abstracted version of Scrabble with no word power needed to play, this is really a question of spotting a good scoring opportunity while not leaving one for your opponents. I'm less enthusiastic about the tiny wooden tiles, this really needed high quality Bakelite pieces, but that's just nit picking.

RATING: 7
Wow, it really does feel like Scrabble.  It's all about finding, not the longest row, but the most profitable one, while trying not to set up the person on your left.  I wonder if I could get any of the anti-word Scrabble-haters I know to try this one.  

For me, it is a little more difficult to process than Scrabble, just because I haven't had as much practice with it. But I like it. (3 plays)

RATING: 8
Clearly reminiscent of Einfach Genial - create rows of 6 blocks with the same colour or same shape and the person placing the 6th block gets a 6 point bonus (Ingenious!) - and yet it's different enough to merit playing as it's own game.  Thick wooden blocks and clear shapes make this game a quality abstract and very simple rules make it easy to teach and play.  But beware, there are subtleties to this game, as there are with Einfach Genial, and it's not just a simple lay-your-tile(s)-score-some-points game.  One tile can be worth 6 or seven points and a group of 3 might only get you 4 points.  Remember, it's points that win the game, not how fast you burn through the tiles - unless you're way in the lead and want to end the game quickly.

Very good family/children's game and good as a filler for game groups.  Excellent physical quality make this one an absolute winner.

Scrabble with shapes and colors goes a *long* way towards describing this game, but that also doesn't do it justice.  It really is a cute little pattern game that it seems somebody must have thought of before.

Apr08: After playing Ingenious, this game just doesn't compare.

The only part that tempered my enjoyment were the bonus points for completing rows of 6s.  They led to annoying blockage and just screwy play to attain them or avoid giving them away.

Also, each turn was a rather solitary affair.  You just couldn't mirror the active player's thoughts because you couldn't see the tiles they had (One of my favorite parts of Carc is playing along with the other players).  The game turned out to be rather quiet and thoughtful, which actually isn't what I look for in games.

Qwirkle is the Spiele des Jahres winner for 2011 ... and while it does not deserve this title it is a pretty good game for people looking for a Scrabble-like substitute game.

Good enough for some light fun. Given away as gift.

Right after the explanation I had this pegged as Scrabble with 'Ingenious aesthetics' and the gameplay confirmed this to be the case. A good game with great components BUT (BIG BUT) I found it to be VERY luck dependant, much more so than the other games it is derived from. 

With so many different possibilites in Scrabble it has more meat on its bones (I won't say deep but I don't consider it to be) and the luck can also be mitigated better (luck can still suck in Scrabble too though). Here whoever draws the most tiles to complete the lines with the 6th and final tile should win, at least between relatively equal players. 

Most turns will net you between 4 and 7 to 8 points.  Adding a 6 point bonus to this in a four player game proved to be lethal for the 3 of us not getting the crucial tiles as often, it wasn't even very close at the end and we all played about the same less the above detail. Was that person lucky to get 6 of those tiles versus 1, 2 or 3 for the other players... yep exactly the point. 

Of course this also has the sitting to the left of the weak player syndrome but considering it is a light family game maybe that point isn't too important. Playing defensively will help this and add to the little strategy that is here but won't really save it for me. 

What I think could save it is change the 6 point bonus to "3" points which will remove some of the emphasis on 'who draws the best tiles at the right times bonus' and focus a little more on who played better throughout the game. I also think playing with only 2 should help reduce luck but I'm not sure it would be worth playing with only 2, I would try it again with 3 players and a 3 point bonus but it isn't very high on my list.

The kids love it. Our now 6yo can be a threat. Lots of laughing about stealing or blocking qwirkles.  Plays a lot like scrabble without the need for a huge vocabulary of small words.  And finding "small words" (or lines) in this game is a hugely important strategy.  Seeing these patterns is not always easy to do and seems to separate the good players.

RATING: 5
It's a pleasant multiplayer puzzle, but luck of the tile draw and placement plays way too heavy of a hand in the game's mechanics to add this to the list of great abstract games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Rated after ten games (a mix of 2 - 4 player games).  A nice abstract tile laying game.  First game I got bit a bit by the luck of the draw, but I think in the end it was poorer hand management and tile placement that lost me the game.  Second game was more even, but my opponent did better with her last few tiles and won by a single point.  There is luck in drawing, but spotting the multiple scoring opportunities with your tile placement is key.

There is certainly some strategy and pattern recognition involved, but over all I find the decisions to be minor and the game to be fairly average. However, this is one of my wife's favorite games. Not only is she likely to request this when we're paling together, it's one of the few games she'll take to gatherings of HER friends because teaching it is so simple.

This is a perfect family game for all ages.  The simple rules and colorful tiles make it easy for even little kids to understand, and the strategy elements can be challenging even for older players.  When I played, I thought it would be easy to master, but I got my butt whipped by a more experienced player.  Lots of fun for a light, quick game.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2015)

At first I didn’t want to play Qwirkle as I had played lots of Qwirkle Cubes, however Qwirkle is the superior game because it removes a whole layer of luck, that’s not to say that the game doesn’t has a healthy luck factor (which it does), but it can be controlled a bit (although the game is pure tactics). In every game luck will give a player many points without any effort from the player in question.

The rules are very easy to explain to non-gamers and gamers alike, so I think Qwirkle is a good family game. It also plays generally quickly but I prefer to play it as a two player game, with more players the downtime and the luck factor increase a lot. The scores are (most of the time) very close, so I feel I have almost no control over the outcome and it is luck that decides the winner. The decisions are pretty obvious. The +6 bonus seems to emphasize the luck of the draw. 

The game components are great and they look gorgeous on the table.

Bottom line, Qwirkle is a good family game, but it is too shallow/light for my current tastes, besides it has a high luck factor that I tend to dislike. I will only play it as a two player game or with very fast players. Otherwise I get bored quickly. I don’t think I will buy it but I can play it from time to time.

RATING: 4
One four-player game only, not enjoyable.

Like many tactical tile-placement games, with a larger group there's little point in setting up a play for your following turn as (after 3 others have had a turn) it's likely that someone else will have taken advantage of the set up play, or at least played some other tiles that invalidate it. This means it seems to boil down to turn by turn opportunism. 

In hindsight, not setting up the following players for easy points (especially the bonus for completing a 6 tile line) is probably the tactic of choice.

The endgame really dragged as players analysed the board to see if there was a play that would net 4 points instead of 3.

The most experienced player won, and did note that it was better as a two player game, but it's sold as taking a larger group so I'm evaluating on that basis.

Knizia's Ingenious (or whatever it was called when last published) is similar but for my money far superior, in that scoring opportunities build over several turns rather than fleetingly appearing then disappearing again. In Ingenious, there is more control and scope for play evolving over a number of turns.

Qwirkle is an excellent abstract game that's easy to get into and plays out fairly quickly, even with the analysis paralysis which will most likely come during play.  There's a luck factor in what blocks will come up, but you generally feel like you choose your fate with how you play.  Good stuff.

The primary strategy of holding back fifth' tiles to avoid others completing a row of six is obvious. Not sure after one game how much more subtle strategies are there that can compensate luck of drawing the right tiles to complete rows of six. It's surprising though how many problems some players have with the logical pattern building in this game. I wonder how it would be to play this with children from 6 years on as it is recommended.

Quite appealing the first couple of plays.  Has that "instant classic" feel.  However, after a couple of plays, it seems too dependent on owning the right tiles for the 6 pt bonuses.  Then the game becomes a bit tedious: counting how many tiles are left of that type, and trading in tiles to search for those high scoring tiles.

It seems like the rules don't award clever play, but lucky draws.

I'm always up for a game of Qwirkle. You can teach new players this and they catch on fast. And don't believe the 4-player max on the box. I've played this successfully with six. I've also seen four-year-olds get Qwirkles. Zero setup time is a huge incentive to play this over other games. The stark solid-on-black look is pleasing. [thing=9674][/thing] has the same look, but with Ingenious the board gets constrained and you're always having to keep an eye on six different tracks at once. With Qwirkle you just make the best move you can and enjoy yourself.

This is easily one of the best abstract puzzle game in my collection. I love set collection games as it gives me satisfaction when I finally reach to the best set. Scoring is little bit annoying but there are many apps assisting that. Overall, this is a superb puzzle game to play.

Qwirkle is a great game that plays well with non gamers.  The rules are simple and most everyone seems to pick the game up with relative ease.  

I never feel like pulling it out if I am with a game group, but as I do play with non gamers fairly often this does see the table every few months.

I think the best evidence to this being a great game for non gamers is that I have had several requests to thrift this for people that haven't even played Catan yet.

Good gameplay, like a picture-based Scrabble where you collect wooden tiles (very nicely made ones) with colors and shapes on them and try to arrange them in sets by attribute, racking up points for doing so. The game comes with a nice cloth bag for storing the wooden tiles, the colors are vibrant and the shapes easy to distinguish, and the gameplay is simple enough for younger children to pick up while still being engaging for adults, making this a great family game.

Never gets old. Solid game if you have 30 minutes to kill. Although there's a huge luck element in drawing the right tiles, you also can strategize based on what's on the board. Three of each type of tile means you can always find something on the board to control.

I do not know why just because it is a simple game it gets a bad rap.  The game has a fair bit of stategy in it, especially sabotaging the board to keep others from getting "qwirkles".

Very fun very easy to introduce new players.

Solid components and very colorful.  Handling the solid 1 inch wood blocks is part of the fun.

Plays like a mix of dominoes, scrabble, and building blocks =P.

My uncle loves this game.Of all the games I brought home from Essen (59 !) with me this one got first to the table.I prefer this one over Ingenious. Ingenious seems to be more luck driven.This one has a lot more scoring going on. You can play more than one piece in a turn (not like the extra turn you get in ingenious) but thanks to good hand management. I feel that the gameplay is more subtle and balanced.This may get an eight if my initial thoughts on this game prove to be right.An eight for me is a high score.  Just take a look at my other ratings.I will definately play this again.the game has simple  rules but this doesn't mean that there is no AP. There is lots of it especially near the end of the game.Because the rules are simple this doesn't mean you shouldn't read them. We started playing the game right away after opening the box. We knew ingenious and read the scoring on he back of the box. We didn't even know of the 6 tiles score a qwirkle and that if you play colours you can only fit in tiles with different symbols. After 5 minutes my uncle who doesn't play boardgames started complaining that this was totally luck driven and we decided to read the rules.We started again and after I dominated him (248 -197) he immediately wanted to play a second game. And kept repeating this is a good game. This is a really good game. He phoned his daughter who lives in the USA to bring a copy with her next time she visites belgium.This will be the second game he owns . He also owns monopoly :(Update: My niece has bought the game for her father.The game is hard to find in Europe allthough it is available in the UK (mindwareonline.co.uk) and France (eveiletjeux.com).

An abstract tile game that simplifies Scrabble.  For me, it is essentially "Scrabble with colors and symbols" instead of alphabets using a crossword-like board for tile laying.  I really wish that a couple sets of the colors were more "color-blind friendly".

RATING: 6
Excellent, quick playing game that is in the vein of blokus in that you have just a couple rules and choices on your turn but the gameplay involves a fair bit of thought for placement purposes.  On your turn you have a choice to play 1-6 tiles (if you can play them in the same row/column) and draw replacement tiles OR you can turn in tiles to the pile and draw new ones.  That's it! You must play tiles in the same row that either match in color but is a completely different shape OR play tiles in a row in which shape matches all the other tiles in the row but the color is different than all the other tiles in the row.  You receive a 6 point bonus for adding the final 6th tile on a row and also if you are the first player to play out of tiles.

The gameplay was fine.  It felt a little like a light, abstract version of Scrabble where both players try to set up long sequences to score points.  I dislike Scrabble, as I'm not a fan of memorizing two letter words, but Qwirkle removes that issue and just goes with simplified colors and symbols.  This does make the game more light weight, but also more accessible.  The scoring does feel a little off, with six tile sequences scoring vastly more points (a "Qwirkle"), so much of the game is mostly defensive to avoid setting your opponent up for a Qwirkle.

My wife actually enjoyed it quite a bit and I can see pulling this out with children as it's a good pattern recognition game.  It's a good game with two, but with more I can see the game becoming more chaotic due to fewer turns by each player.

RATING: 8
Though not universally admired by my serious game friends Qwirkle has been a big hit with my non-gamer friends.

The qualiity of the tiles, simplicity of the rules, evolving board and scoring system provide an enjoyable experience with often very close results.  However, the serious gamers point to the lack of strategy, the luck of the draw and highlighting that only a few obvious moves to be made on your turn and even damn it as a micro-optimisation game.

In the cold light of day it is impossible to contradict the serious gamers in my group.  However, in my opinion the fact that there are 3 of each piece means that some thought can be given to tactics, calculating odds and decision making.  Plus the usual close scores and the determination not to leave opportunities for an opponents 'Qwirkle' provides an experience where you are in a real competitive game even though it maybe a lighter experience and ultimately less rewarding than some had hoped for.  Furthermore the fact that it plays well with 2, 3 or 4 means that I strongly recommended the game for a family boardgame option (especially with kids) or with groups of mixed level of interests in boardgames.

In regards to Qwirkle both my serious and the less-serious game friends are right.  However, I feel that the game suceeds for its target audience (the less serious) and has real replay value which might even turn some of the non-gamers into future gamers.  Next step Ingenious.

Light travel version. Components aren't as nice as the original, with some paint scuffing. Smaller tiles makes for a much smaller footprint. Still no pad or other mechanism for score keeping included though, which is the biggest detraction.

Wife and I liked this a lot. Similar to Ingenious which we both enjoy. Plays very quick and the scores have been very close each time. I do wish the game came with a big black bag or something for the blocks instead of just the box.

I plan on grabbing this one in the near future and getting a sack for it too.

FOR THE KIDS: (Usually) I typically hate this type of game, but Qwirkle is excellent fun. It is easy to learn, easy to teach, plays quickly... and is a bit addictive. Sometimes, when we're in the mood for something light, we play it while cooking dinner or we teach it to non-gamers.

Two-player: Bleh. This game feels like a chore. After 15 minutes I wanted it to be over; after 30 I was tempted to play poorly so it would end faster.

There are few decisions to be made (I never felt like I contributed much to the outcome), most choices are obvious, most turns are dull, and it takes too long for what (little) it is. Too much luck, too little thinking.

I didn't miss any rules (I checked), so unless I'm missing some subtlety that only reveals itself after multiple plays, which I don't think I am, the only reason I'd play this again would be if someone asked me to and there were no better alternatives available.

The travel edition is nicely packaged, but the orange and red tiles are too similar to each other in color.

A nice & simple game.  Kinda like Scrabble without words, but the lack of bonuses and area management makes it a bit less interesting to me. It's a good one to keep around because of its high accessibility, but I traded my copy because I've got other games I like more for that purpose.

Surprisingly weak Spiel des Jahres, with some downtime issues. The simplicity and Scrabble pedigree creates a package that I can see is attractive to some.

Qwirkle is an excelllent game that stands up to many plays. This game reminds me most of scrabble, a game I also like. When creating words by placing tiles in Scrabble there are thousands of possible plays. This tends to slow the game down for me because I always feel like I could be making a better play. While playing Qwirkle however the tile placement options are limited enough for me to still feel clever without having to analyze the board for ten minute. A great feature for the others I play with!

Best game of 2006.
I'm kind of sick of this, since it's a non-gamer magnet. But you have to admire these games, and we need them to keep modern boardgaming alive. Besides... it might be abstract, but it's not boring. Big minus for not including scoreboard, how much would it cost, like 2 euros?

Excellent little game with seriously addictive traits.  I never want to play just one game.  It's a nice change from Scrabble and I imagine would be very accessible to kids because of the colors and nice wooden bits.  Amazing that it came from an American publisher.

RATING: 7
My mom's favourite game right now (she's 80) and it makes a great two-player choice with just about anybody as an opponent. With more players, there's a bit more down time, but also a bit more suspense anticipating what will be left open on the next move. 

This game can be played well and with certain skills to be developed and mastered but there is a great deal of luck involved, as I still have a better concept of the game's rules but still get beaten by my mom regularly, even after 20 games. That's what makes a good social game, though!

After about 30 plays, there are far more games where I felt the luck of the draw was at work as opposed to how I played, it's not something I would play more often. Still my mom's favourite, so I'll play it about once a week, which is okay with me.

Qwirkle Select and Qwirkle Connect are definitely worth checking out for anyone who thinks the base game lacks depth.

I wish the game played a little shorter. My games typically take about 50 minutes which is a little long for a lunch hour.

This is a simple, fun game with high-quality bits. I worry slightly about how durable the paint job on wood is, but the game pieces have a pleasant feel in your hand. Tactile components and visual appeal are two things that can only add to the gaming experience for me. Its only problem is that sometimes the balance of pieces drawn can be a bit one-sided, which means one person only gets to play the odd piece, where those with good hands draw 4- or 5 tiles. Sometimes, the only option is to sacrifice a turn for a new hand draw. Still good, though. Plus, my family will play it with me without any coaxing. At the end of the day I'd rather own a game like this and have people play it than TI:3 and not have any takers.

One other thing: the pieces are both shiny and dark, which means discerning colours can be difficult in subdued light. Fine in daylight or under strong flourescents; however, I tend to play (at least at home) by light of a couple of table lamps, at which point Qwirkle pieces become decidedly murky. Colour-blind gamers should pass entirely.

I've expected a light abstract, as it's advertised as Scrabble without letters, but it's more like Ingenious without a trace of strategy. Anyone I played with was bored to tears, irrespective of age, gender or number of players.

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: People say it’s like Scrabble without letters or board, and that’s pretty apt.  Instead, you use big chunky tiles to line up different colors and symbols with far simpler scoring.

Played as: 2,3,4,5 player

Pros: Great big chunky, colorful tiles, very quick to learn and teach, and a game that can grow a greater amount of depth along with the players. The game has a very light, friendly feel where you need to try really hard to be obviously nasty; yet it can be equally cut-throat when players know what they’re doing. The game’s just pretty to play.

Cons: As the play area grows, so do the possibilities for a player on their turn... that means Analysis Paralysis. It has that same thing I despised about Scrabble where players want to study the board a thousand times over looking to find the very best possible move on their turn. Granted it’s not to the same degree of severity, but it’s there. It feels like the game could suffer from having a player who doesn’t know what’s going on accidentally handing easy point opportunities to other players. Tallying scores constantly on pencil and paper seems a little old-fashioned.

Other: I’ll need to play more to know how much luck-of-the draw effects things, but my initial impression is only moderately. This game, more then any other in my collection, makes me want to invest in a good timer.

Best Use: A great game for 3-4 to play while carrying on a conversation on the side... that, or a vicious tile-laying game for two.

This is a logic puzzle that works well for anyone who enjoys the mechanisms of Scrabble but might not be big wordsmiths. You are combining shapes and colours, either different shapes in one colour or one shape in different colours, you score whichever rows/columns you add tiles to and if you manage to finish a full set you score additional bonus points.

It's simple to teach and learn, but like its word-driven counterpart, it takes a while to fully master.

21-Jan-2014: Only a single play of this one so far as it was recently added to the collection as a Christmas gift, but I see it hitting the table more than Ingenious because of its portability...we have the travel version.

Anyway, this is like Scrabble but with colors and shapes instead of letters and words.  You need to play tiles to rows or columns of matching color or matching shape.  This should be a fun, easy to teach abstract for various family and varying situations.

I still think Ingenious is a better game with its extra level of strategy through its scoring mechanism, but this is a solid entry into the family-friendly abstract realm and am glad we finally own a copy.

I'm really liking this one.  We seem to be, after only 3 plays, developing very predictable patterns of play. This has lost ground to Ingenious, which feels similar but better. 2015 Update: We've now played this countless times, and I've raised the rating.

Disappointing. There's a definite luck of the draw factor in [i]Qwirkle[/I] which is okay if the luck evens out. Unfortunately in all four of our games the luck has been one-sided, which is tedious and frustrating for the loser(s) and not very satisfying for the winner. On the plus side, it is a beautifully produced game; I think I would have enjoyed it when I was a kid. [4 plays; traded]

SDJ hozzávalók: rövid és egyszerű szabály, könnyen elsajátítható (sőt ezesetben ismerős) játékmenet, egy kis szerencse, szép és áttekinthető kivitelezés, rövid játékidő. A Qwirkle tipikusan ilyen.
Egyértelműen érezhető, hogy a szerző a Scrabbleből merített (kimondva mindkettő olyan, mint a tüsszentés..:P), de szerencsére sikerült jót alkotnia belőle. Én nem szeretem a Scrabblet, mert vontatott és korlátozott. A Qwirkleben nincsen tábla, a lapkalerakásnak 2 alapvető szabálya van csak, így pörög a játék, max 45 perc alatt simán lezavarható. Érzésre valahol a családi és a logikai játékok között helyezkedik el. Habár én nyerek, mégis úgy érzem, hogy a szerencse szerepe jelentős. Ugyanakkor rá lehet érezni, mit mikor érdemes eldobni, lerakni, gyűjteni, de ami még fontosabb, hogy vigyázni kell, nehogy mást hozzunk helyzetbe. Vagy csak szimplán jókat húzok... Nem tudom, még nem sikerült megfejteni. Mindenesetre a lányok körében siker, nyugis, könnyed családi játék, zsákban hordva pedig bárhová vihető és játszható. Remélem idővel kiderül, hogy sokkal több múlik a döntéseinken, mint a szerencsén. Ennek megfelelően fog helyezkedni a jövőben a polcomon.
Azért azt a végére még meg kell jegyezzem, hogy a játék közbeni pontok felírogatása a halálom...

Qwirkle ist ein abstraktes Knobelspiel, bei dem man hölzerne Blöcke passend aneinander legen muss. Dabei kann man auf Arben oder Symbole gehen, wovon es heweils sechs Möglichkeiten gibt. Je länger die Reihe desto mehr Punkte bekommt man. Also alles relativ simpel und für eine schnelle Knobelrunde zwischendurch auch durchaus ok. Wie Qwirkle "Spiel des Jahres" werden konnte, entzieht sich aber meiner Kenntnis. Das Prinzip ist nicht neu und so fesselnd ist Qwirkle nicht. Ich für meinen Teil habe nach einer Partie jedenfalls erstmal genug...

Really neat abstract tile laying game that feels like a cross between dominoes and scrabble (in some mechanics - but not literally in game play terms).

Works as a great gateway game and lets the players find neat little moves that are satisfying.

Scales really well. At 2-players it is a very strategic game. Still plays really well with 3-4 but the luck factor goes up considerably as you cannot plan moves ahead with any certainty. Still fun though.

This is a very good find.

Combine colors or symbols and score for all rows and columns completed.

Fun game that does an excellent job of disguising the fact that it's an abstract.  Imagine Scrabble without the hassle of having to learn words such as "xi" and you are here or hereabouts.  The rules are easy to learn, but, as with all the good abstracts, there is much to discover within that ruleset.  Better still, once the game is over the lovely components give you that "Look what I built!" feeling you get from a tile-layer.

For such a tight little design it is a real shame that the red/orange difference can be so hard to spot (white for orange, anybody?), and it is probably impossible to play if you are colour-blind.  That apart, this is a great lighter abstract, better still if, like me, you find one of the many copies sitting in charity shops.

A Scrabble-style abstract in which players make typically obvious choices to keep their constant dribble of points flowing. Not especially exciting and not especially strategic, since tile draws are random and the board state is volatile. There are sometimes better moves to be made on a given turn and some light defensive possibilities, but this strikes me as fairly routine stuff, even if I can appreciate its simplicity.

Sort of a cross between Dominos, Uno, and Scrabble.  This is a very easy game to learn, and our children really enjoy it.  There isn't much strategizing to do, though, and most games end up with players quietly assessing their tiles and the game board.

Each tile consists of six different colors, and six different shapes, to play tiles they need to share one attribute.  Your playing area will be played ala Scrabble, instead of words, you are matching sets of 6 of the same color, or shape.  Score by counting the amount of tiles the set (or sets) that you added to, a bonus of 6 is awarded for finishing off a set of 6.

The game has a surprising amount of strategy involved, it is easy to learn, and plays in about a half hour.  We enjoy it with three players so far.

It's a simple abstract with nice components. Sort of a Scrabble with only shapes and colors. Not sure how big role there is with luck. The points for completing 6-in-a-row feel a bit too random in general and give plenty of points. It also might be that we aren't playing as defensively as we should. Works 2 or 4 players just as well but actually might be a bit more interesting with full 4 players as then even leaving a 5-row somewhere is "only" giving 12+ easy points for one of the players.

I much prefer this over Scrabble. It's a shame one of the chosen shapes wasn't a hexagon. The world needs more brightly colored hexagons.

Update: played this some more. I realized color blind people would have trouble with this; it's too bad red and green are so commonly undistinguished as privileged colors. Also, I've found that I prefer this as a two player game; more, and I feel bored (or worse, stymied) while waiting for my turn.

EDIT: Also very, very good with three, and still good with four.

Very nice wooden pieces - too large to easily put back in the box, but that's actually a good thing- the pieces pack perfectly, so you know immediately if one is missing.

Choice of colours is a bit annoying (I'm colourblind), but a dab with a Sharpie fixed it.

Recommended, especially to transition  people with limited experiece of boardgames.

Very simple, yet deep abstract game. Just try not to get a group that take it too seriously as it can get very clogged up if everyone is holding back tiles.

Six colors and six shapes! Make a row of six without duplicating color or shape. My head almost exploded a few times. EDIT: Bobby4th said it he thinks it actually did explode. :) 16Jun07-Accused of "breaking Qwirkle". Apparently people don't like me making them draw on their turn because they don't have anything to play. We started over thanks to democracy. For the record, I could have played off of what was there. 11Aug07--My 1000th game logged on BGG! Played with Bobby4th, Greg, and Kyle at The Game Depot, Arizona. 15Dec07--Didn't have a decent way to keep score so just played for the 6 bonus points for going out. Changed the strategy completely.

A nice abstract, tile matching, point collecting game. There's the constant dilemma of trying to maximise points whilst not setting up the next player to get even more points. The decision tree of candidate good moves isn't too broad, so play tends to tick along nicely with the occasional pause - a good thing in an abstract. Yes it feels like an illiterate man's Scrabble, with the crossword feel and the tile swapping action. Being alert to the tiles that are gone (there are 3 of each) will help you determine safe plays which opponents can't build off, so there's a bit of board perusal and counting required. There's not a lot of tension or drama though - it's more of a gradual points acquisition pastime.

easy to pick up the concept. can suffer from AP when trying to hit the optimal move every turn. although most games ive played the scores have been very close i guess it is possible to consistantly pull poor tiles from the bag. barry doublet of dice tower fame posed a varient, by acident, that could mitigate this somewhat, go watch his video!

This is scrabble with shapes and colours instead of letters. I have played this game mostly with non-gamers who do tend to enjoy it.

RATING: 5
A fairly simple game of matching either colors or shapes. The involved part comes from strategy of blocking possible plays or setting someone up for a Qwirkle. Scoring builds on itself like Scrabble, but with Qwirkle you don't need any language skills. The game comes with a cloth bag which you can keep the peices in, so there is no need for a box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This abstract game takes the tile-laying strategy from Scrabble (which I really like), but removes the reliance on a dictionary (which I'm not a huge fan of).  The result is a pretty good game.  If, like me, you really like Scrabble but resent having to memorize all of those ridiculous 2- and 3- letter non-words that count, you'll like Qwirkle.  However, there's still quite a bit of luck in drawing the right tiles at the right times.

Scrabble light (with Shapes/Colors instead of letters);  The subtraction of the making words part is fine, but the lack of important board placement decisions & the much higher luck factor makes this one not nearly as much fun.  Seems to go over well with non-gamers though.

An abstract game with nice idea. Gameplay runs smoothly but there is a small chance for AP since you really don't want to give the +6 bonus points to anyone (scored by making six in a row).

The wooden components are bit too expensive for my taste but still pretty. The pics are large and languance-dependency is zero.

A nice filler to be played occasionally.

This is a very simple game. I see I will bring this out when my parents are playing with us but not just the 2 of us. I also see this game is a lot more fun with 4 players than 2. With 2 there are not enough tile variety so there are turns used in redrawing tiles.

Pattern matching is one of the best ways to encourage cognitive growth in young brains. Given that finding, Qwirkle is brilliant.

Place tiles within the restrictions to score points. Keep tabs on if you might be leaving anything juicy open for your opponents to capitalize on.
And hey it's got the brainy people's club logo on it so at the least you should have it on your shelf so you look smarter than you really are. But if you're taking my advice to buy a game you must be pretty brilliant already, so there you go.

One 5-player game with myself, wife, and 3 experienced players. Tiles are of very high quality although the red and orange colors are a bit too close together. Had 7 tile hand, in error, rules say only 6.

A little disappointing.  Fine game, but no Scrabble.  Color and shape choices were unfortunate (squares and diamonds? orange and red?).  2-player took 1 hour and there wasn't a lot of look-ahead.  Maybe if players held 7 tiles you could do a little more planning.  Don't know.  Second playing: still think it's awfully dependent upon draw of the tiles--defensive with a neat windfall from time to time.

Very nice wooden components and colors. Very easy rules to explain and it all makes up for a nice 30 mins activity of tile matching game. Not really competitive, though, as it's all about good eye and luck of the draw. But it's quite good experience for what the box offers.

Idő közben sikerült a játékkal többet játszanunk, és ennek köszönhetően a pontszámon is emeltem egyet. Továbbra sem tartom azonban év játéka díjasnak, mert ahhoz egy picit túl egyszerű. Bár lehet, hogy pont ez emelte olyan magasra a 2011-es évben.

Nagy hátrányként a folyamatos matekot tartanám és az állandó pontnyilvántartást, amire a legegyszerűbb módszer papír és valami írószerszám.

A játék viszonylag gyors és befejezést követően szinte visszavágóért kiállt.

Qwirkle is a lackluster abstract that takes too long for what it is.
I was surprised at how many moves it takes to finish the game.
I had assumed it was just a quick filler, from seeing it listed by Steph so often in the Crepeville Meetups, but it seemed like it would take many many moves before the 1-4 (?) blocks would be played and the game finished.

Even amongst familiar adults, I'd think so many blocks and turns would make the game take longer than the gameplay is worth....?
Perhaps if only 2 of each block were included instead of 3?

The gameplay seemed quite stifling, with many areas of the board unable to be added to, due to restrictive color/shape placements and Qwirkles disallowing blocks to be placed.
This further slows down the number of blocks that can be placed on an average turn, elongating the game more.
When you add in the fact that it is strategically unwise to play the 4th or especially the 5th block in a potential Qwirkle (setting up your opponent for the big payoff) it further forces the player to hoard the blocks, again slowing play and reducing the blocks that are refreshed in your hand per turn.
[b]In a game like this, IMO the designer should have made rules to speed up play, not slow it down.[/b]

Very similar to Ingenious, though a bit more wide open (and thus, a bit simpler and less strategic). Very appealing to newbies, though there is enough present to provide gamers with a solid diversion.

There's really not much to say. Simple, accessible, fun game great for newcomers and experienced players alike. A bit like "Scrabble" without the words. Extremely simple rules, but there's some room for tactical play. After multiple plays it still feels fun, great replay value.
UPDATE: Bumping it up to 10. Why? Because after 100 plays we love it as much as we did in the beginning. For us, the best simple, quick and relaxing abstract game.

It's sometimes fashionable to dislike abstracts, even those that win awards, but I like this game a lot.  For anyone that ever liked Scrabble but had too much AP or hated people challenging words in a dictionary - this game is for you.  It can be hard to tell the orange and red color tiles apart in some lighting, but that is a minor quibble to an excellent game.  Everyone that has tried this one has really liked it.  I had an extra copy of this game and a friend of mine that tried it for the first time immediately bought one of the two copies from me.  He has played a TON of my games and it's only the second he has wanted to own himself (the first being, Thunderstone).

RATING: 6
Fun for all the family.  This is a game that has the feel of a classic, not in the sense of being an outstanding game, but simply in that it will be picked up immediately by anyone you explain it to because the rules are simple and intuitive.  Also, it will appeal to people who like Scrabble and cards but don't won't to play any "new fangled" stuff.  The play is somewhat similar to Ingenious, though Qwirkle is more of a hand management game and feels a little like Mah Jongg.  I prefer Qwirkle to Ingenious as the game play is interesting throughout (Ingenious only seems to shine at the end) because of the possibility of playing multiple tiles, and of its more rigourous hand management requirements.  There is certainly luck involved, but this is what makes it a game that Grandparents and grandkids can play together. A satisfying way to spend time with family and friends, though not a "gamers" game.

RATING: 7.1
Fun game to pass the time, when playing with kids.

We played it wrong several times, not realizing that no "doubles" were allowed in a row....which is a fundamental rule of the game.The longest a row in Qwirlke is 6 tiles (at which point it is declared a 'Qwirkle' and you get a 6 point bonus for creating it).

I bought this on campus and played the first two games in the Cougar Eats with my 2 sons and youngest daughter while we waited for my wife and oldest daughter to go to a doctor's appointment.  Winning team got a chocolate milk...so the competition kept it interesting.

Um jogo com muitas decisões para tomar, apostas a fazer e pontos a amealhar, que permite um sem fim de jogos sem nunca ser igual e onde cada um consegue ter espaço para aplicar a sua própria estratégia. Qwirkle é um jogo onde reina a simplicidade, mas onde, para ganhar, há que ter a mistura certa entre sorte e capacidade de análise, pois aqui não funcionam uma sem a outra. Uma grande a muito agradável surpresa, entra directamente para o ranking dos 5 melhores abstractos puros, onde se bate muito aguerridamente com Blokus, Genial e Blockers. Obrigatório!

Players: 2-4
Time: 40 min.

Abstract game where each tile is one of six shapes and one of six colors. Players score points by making lines of all one color (but no shape may be used more than once) or all one shape (but no color may be used more than once). You get bonus points if you complete a Qwirkle (a line of 6 shapes/colors containing all six colors/shapes). Involves more strategy and tactics than you might expect.

A simple shapes and colours game. Players alternate adding tiles to a crossword style arrangement, scoring points for rows of the same colour but different shape or same shape but different colour. The best score is achieved by creating a row of 6 (the maximum).
Play requires some turn to turn planning and an awareness that you may open up possibilities for the opponent.

A game in what I call the "family abstract" category. In some ways, this is Scrabble without the words - the latter being a definite plus for me (not that my vocabulary is bad; I think it's pretty good, it's just that Scrabble is dull as ditchwater). It's not terribly engrossing, but playing this with the family is at least mildly diverting and not unenjoyable.

I would rather play Ingenious, which Qwirkle has some similarity to.  Although I would rather play Qwirkle than Scrabble, which Qwirkle is quite similar to.

My big complaint with this game is with the production choice concerning color.  My mom has difficulty distinguishing blue and green, so if I decided to play this game with her I would have to modify the game.  Would it have been too much to ask for to have the name of the color or some 2nd symbol printed on the pieces?

Qwirkle is one of those games that I never suggest playing myself, yet will never turn down a game when it's offered.  There are a few strategic things that can help score maximum points.  Cycling tiles as quickly as possible (i.e. not holding tiles hoping to complete a qwirkle when a fairly high number of points could be achieved by playing those tiles, etc) helps, as does monitoring the bag and beginning to build tiles that can all be played together as the end draws near.  This helps you to run out of tiles first claiming that bonus.  Still, it's always fun and always enjoyable.  Even my 9 year old loves playing this and usually makes some very good moves!

Sikerült kipróbálni a 2011-es év SdJ győztesét. Szerintem nem véletlen, hogy megkapta az első helyet.
Klasszikus családi játék. Kiváló kapudrog válhat belőle. Véleményem szerint túl nagy benne a szerencsefaktor (természetesen ez nem meglepő, hiszen családi), ráadásul az 5-ös sorok létrehozásával elég magas labdákat lehet feldobni az utánunk következőnek.
Alapvetően tetszett, de gémer lelkületűekkel nekiugorva porszáraz tud lenni. Túlságosan absztrakt, ugyanakkor pofonegyszerű szabályrendszerű is egyben.
Ami számomra furcsa még egy kicsit a játékkal kapcsolatban, hogy a kivitelezés minősége lehetne jobb. Fa elemekből áll ugyan, de azoknak szinte semmi súlya.  A fekete "borítás" itt-ott már jön le (4-5 játékot követően).

Abstract with 108 tiles with 6 colors and 6 shapes amounting to 36 different tiles x3. Players get points for placing tiles in rows with the same color but different shape or the same shape but different color. The one placing the 6th tiles gets a bonus. Simple, elegant and addictive. Can lead to long games if people are prone to AP. Also reminds me of Scrabble because in both games it's possible to think a long time per turn if trying to find the placement which results in most points.

I dislike the Scrabble-like downtime as you wait for your turn (after you've thought out which tiles to play), but, at least it doesn't have the annoyance of the "Scrabble-only words". There's definitely a beginning-, mid-, and end-game to Qwirkle as you count up the tile frequency to help plan your next move. However, the Qwirkle bonus resulted in many of us just pitching several tiles in our hands and hoping we'd draw tiles that would get us the bonus.

Played a 3 player game. I thought the game was going to take forever as we are laying one or two tiles at a time and there are total of 108 of them. It turned out about a bit more than an hour. Fun little game with kids. The rule is easy to teach. We just played the tiles wherever we can instead of thinking of strategy. But this game had huge amount of luck factory. Even you plan ahead, you can easier get screwed. "6" for me after first play.

Visual Appeal: (5) 
This game actually looks really nice! I wasn't expecting anything more than Scrabble with colors, but the bright colors on black wood tiles and a boardless setup makes for an attractive combination.

Components: (5)
For a simple game, it has great pieces. Even the tile bag is pretty well made. Not much else to say. Simple and it feels good.

Theme: (0)

Learning: (5)
Really easy to teach to all ages. Young kids get the colors and shapes pretty well and they like to think about all their possible moves. I think it's a great spatial learning tool for kids. It doesn't have any learning curve really, and there's no skill development to speak of. You just make good moves or bad moves.

Gameplay: (3)
You can block players and grab points before they do. Sometimes you can see and predict where they are setting up to score and beat them to it. However, it is not possible if you don't have the right tiles and your tiles are drawn blindly from a bag.

Overall Fun: (3)
This game is OK. I prefer other puzzle/abstracts, but this one plays a group and is a nice light filler, especially if we have a younger crowd who want to jump in for a round.

I like Qwirkle. The colour scheme bugs me, although the game does at least play a good function in the colour-blindness department by helping raise awareness of how colour-blindness can affect a game - because when my tiles are standing up I am damned if I can tell the difference between blue & green and orange & red.

Picked up from thrift store, missing one piece, which a fellow BGGer was gracious enough to send to me.  Good family and strategy game that anyone can play.  Luck is always part of the deal with drawing new tiles, but you can definitely impact the game based on the choices you make.  This will get played from time to time I'm sure.

RATING: 8
Easy to teach and play. Compare with Scrabble but without words -- instead you play lines of 2-6 tiles horizontally or vertically. There are 108 tiles, three each of six colors and six symbols. A qwirkle is a line of tiles that 1. have the same color but different symbols OR 2. have the same symbol but different colors. All lines on the table must be qwirkles or partial qwirkles, so no line will be longer than 6 tiles. All plays other than the first must connect to existing tiles on the board.

The first player lays out a single tile for 1 point or plays or line to the table, forming a partial (very likely) or full (you lucky dog) qwirkle. All subsequent plays must either 1. extending either or both end of an existing line, or 2. create a new line. These plays may form or extend additional lines in the process, all of which score.

It's easy to show with an example but I'm doing the simplicity no justice here. Just imagine each tile is a Scrabble tile and the only "words" allowed are qwirkles and partial qwirkles as I've described above. Then you pretty much get how to lay out tiles. Each line that you create or extend scores points, 1 point for each tile in each line, so a tile that's part of two lines (picture an L) scores two points. Making a qwirkle gives a 6 point bonus, as does going "out" first. Forming as many lines as you can is usually the best way to get a high score, but just like in Scrabble you've got tile swapping, rack management, and avoiding making plays that can be easily scored (e.g., avoid giving other players qwirkle opportunities).

UPDATE Jun-14-2010: Moving up to an 8, because I tend to suggest this one a lot. It's a good quick filler.

Smart refinement of Scrabble that cuts out the fluff and isolates the 'game' portion, leading to a more accessible game. Makes you wish you had thought of it first (and won an SdJ with it!).

 - No board for portability and a more dynamic look
 - Colors & shapes remove the need for the dreaded Scrabble dictionary, which everybody seems to have a different (mental) version of
 - More elegance due to ease of counting tiles (3 of each instead of rarity) and every tile counting the same in scoring

The important dynamic of going for the '6-letter word' while scoring multiple words on your 'build-up' turns remains and is in full force.

2011 Birthday gift for Julia from Zack

Qwirkle remains my favorite abstract casual game that potentially could be played cross-cultural being that its components and gameplay are not necessarily language dependent.  It is the only board game that my wife and I have managed to play several times with her strong quiet type outdoorsman father.  The painted wood components and cloth drawstring bag for selecting tiles from are top notch.  I actually feel smarter after playing this MENSA approved game.  I also appreciate that this game is relaxed enough to allow for significant conversation while it is being played.  This is the kind of game you could get your grandparents to play at a holiday get together.

RATING: 8
It's basically a twist on dominoes. It's a good thinker, but no theme and no player interaction. There are a certain number of each tile, so card counters use that to their advantage! Really good between a super simple filler and a heavy game. I own the travel version which I feel is better than the full size version because the tiles are smaller, it takes up less table space, and comes in it's own storage bag which doubles as the draw bag when pulling tiles.

This is something I was interested in picking up as soon as I heard about it.  For all practical purposes, this is scrabble with colors and symbols.  Granted, there is a lot of randomness in the tile draws.  However, there is a lot of opportunity for good tactical play, particularly if you are paying attention to the tiles that have been placed already.  You certainly don't want to give points away to an opponent if you don't have to.  One advantage this game has is that you can play with children who are not yet able to play scrabble in a reasonable fashion.  [01/08/2011]

This is a fun, simple mash-up of dominoes (placement) and scrabble (scoring) that works well at every player count. Games are not overly long and playing it feels both "thinky" and relaxing.

Bought the travel size on clearance thinking we'd play it on vacation. The travel size version's tiles are tiny, for my old eyes I can sometimes get confused on shape and color. We still like the game but I have been looking for a good deal on the regular size game or the dice version. The fact that this game and Iota are abstract and easily teachable makes us play it more than I would have guessed.

RATING: 5
Played this once some years ago and it seemed quite fluffy and harmless.  So we picked it for kids gaming workshops and found out it's quite thinky and brainburning. Ooops. 

I don't see this as an abstract game, but as a word game, a scrabble with no words. Which is a neat trick - Scrabble (played online) is about spatial positioning but also about learning a bizarre dictionary of some rare words. Qwirkle disposes with the dictionary part and get down to hand management and looking for combos on the board. The higher level play is also about watching for tiles with all 6 copies of it on the board so you can exploit this (madness!). 

It is pretty accessible, looks neat and offers thinkiness to people who are after that kind of stuff.

Simple abstract that is a bit of Set and a lot of Ingenious. Just add tiles a la Scrabble uniting like shapes or like colours. Double your points if you add the sixth (and final) tile to a line of tiles. 2-4 players. Personally I like Ingenious a bit better, but I don't mean to detract from Qwirkle. Its accessible and fun.

[39 plays] Gave this to Dad for Father's Day (and Mom's 75th birthday was the same day, so a gift to both of them by default). Bought it for them on the strong feeling that it would be a great game for them. It was a hit. Dan and I also enjoyed the game very much. It has simple rules but lots of opportunities for clever plays, quick scoring, and nice tension at times.

I think this game is a true beauty in the family game realm. I find it hard to believe that such a clever and well produced game with 108 big wooden blocks goes for $25 retail. Awesome.

Update 9-9-07: Continue to be impressed with this game. Caveman Scrabble rocks! For people who just want to have fun, be presented with some tension and interesting choices, and all of that without the obnoxious memorizing of obscure dictionary words that comes with high level Scrabble.

It's a fine game, but I feel like it drags on a lot longer than it should. Some months ago it occurred to me that I could remove one symbol and one color, and score qwirkles as 10pts, but I wasn't attracted enough to the gameplay to ever try it. I also wonder whether qwirkles would be to easy to score in that variant?

I do think this is a well-made abstract game.

Kipróbálva a 2011-es év egyik Év játéka jelöltjét kellemes tapasztalatokat szereztem, de közel sem nyűgözött le a játék. Hatféle szimbólum és hat szín kombinációját rakjuk le kis fatéglatestek formájában, ebből alakul ki a szép végeredmény a játék végén. Mindenki hat elemből választ és vagy színnel vagy különböző formával szabályosan annyi elemet rakhat le, amennyit egy sor kialakításával létre tud hozni. Aki a hat különböző szimbólumot vagy hat különböző színt létre tudja hozni bónusz pontokat kap lerakáskor. A játék nem nehéz, akár családdal is játszható, de én mégis úgy éreztem van min gondolkodni és jobban is játszhattam volna, ha több időt töltök a lehetőségek végigszámolásával, amivel viszont rendesen elnyújtható a játék. Jó játék a Qwirkle, de valahogy nem annyira elegáns, letisztult, mint a Genial vagy a Rosenkönig számomra.

[2011-08-12]
A játék hibája a nevéből létrejövő hatosokért járó bónuszrendszer, ugyanis ha a gyengébb játékos sokszor feladja a labdát a mögötte ülőnek (5-ösöket hoz létre), azzal tulajdonképpen megnyereti a játékot vele. Talán ezt kevesebb bónuszponttal egyensúlyoznám ki.

Pretty to look at. Plays like Scrabble, so it is easy to teach.  At its heart though, the player that draws the best tiles at the right time will win, the players that don't will lose.  The only reason that I give it this high of a rating is that it does have some placid charm to it.  There is a zenlike zone-out quality to it similar to playing Solitaire on the computer.  It also doesn't give off any pretense that there is much more game here than what is at its surface, so that makes the draw-logy a little more tolerable.

The real problem with the game is that there is some downtime as you have to assess what all your options are.  Because of this, you have to ask yourself why am I not playing Scrabble?  I guess this is equivalent of playing Sudoku for those that don't want to invest their energy in the Crosswords.

RATING: 7.5
Good game for mixed-ages.  Simple rules, no reading or math (beyond counting) required (except of the score-keeper).  Abstract with a luck of the draw component but plenty of room for decision-making that matters.  Scales well from 2-4.  Nice components (chunky wooden tiles with colorful symbols).  

This game reminds me of Ingenious, but I prefer it to Ingenious because the choices seem more varied and interesting. That's because you may play more than one tile at once and because there are two different/independent attributes you can play off of on any tile (which gives you alternative ways of blocking).  Also it's easier to count tiles.  

One tip:  replace the draw pile with a large (e.g. shoe-sized) drawstring bag.  Because you don't know where the board will grow, it's hard to find a location for the draw pile that is both accessible to everyone and not in the way.

Qwirkle is basically Scrabble with shapes and colors. The 'word' you create must be composed of tiles sharing either the same shape or color (but not both). Score 1 point per 'word' formed by your play. There are 6 shapes in 6 colors. Score 6VP bonus if you create a 6-length word. Game ends when any player uses his last tile.

It's a fun game, I suppose.

Simple, but fun. No strategy really, just get as many points on a turn as possible, but that can require some ... concentration? It seems obvious after someone points out what you should have done! But probably only 2 points difference, in a game that will go to 100 some points that isn't so significant. So there is downtime as people who really want those 2 points think. Seems very luck dependent, either you have a blue circle or you do not. Maybe in a two player game you could try to set yourself up for your next turn? Maybe, but mostly good for casual fun.

This is actually a quite fun tile laying game. Somewhat of a cross between Scrabble, Rummy and Ingeneous, but simpler than any of those. But it's not brainless at all, as there are more than enough possibilities for clever moves. Good play will always beat lucky draws, that's for sure.

A game that rewards sub-optimal play by giving more points for building in two directions than one.  As a result, there are ways of getting points that block future expansion of the play area.  Not a fan.  I will play to humor other people, though.

+ Easy to teach and plays with only tiles and draw bag
+ Some depth as you need to maximize your score every turn without opening the board too much.

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- Counting points continuously
- Waiting time when playing with spatial recognition impaired people.

:star: VERDICT
An easy to teach abstract where you have to optimize your move every turn with what's available to you. I just hate playing it with spatial recognition impaired people as my turn last 30 seconds and I hate waiting for it to be my turn again.

Just as in my "Marvel Heroes"/"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Game" original ratings, I am greatly amused to discover that I have given this game the same rating as I gave to "Scrabble".  This is because the scoring mechanism of this game is very reminiscent of "Scrabble", so there is a fairly obvious comparison here.  But whereas "Scrabble" requires a great deal more brain-power and (for those of us who are prone to Analysis Paralysis) time, "Quirkle" falls more into the "fun little filler game" category, if you want to label a 45 minute playing time a "filler" (which I do).  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 5
Simple and clever tile game with some similarities to Scrabble. Each tile has a two attributes, colour and shape, and adjacent tiles must extend/create a set based on one of them. Points are scored points based on the new length, with a bonus for complete sets (six). It's a solid family game, all the positional play of Scrabble without the vocabulary requirement.

With non-gamers I prefer dexterity games and with gamers I would never want to play it over something similar but heavier such as Kachina/Völuspá.

This game was on my wishlist after having read a lot of good things about others who found copies at the thrift store.  I found a copy at the thrift store this week and wife and I gave it a spin tonight.  

Definitely a lot of fun and some tough choices to be made at certain points of the game.  Enjoyed this very much and I think repeat plays will be just as fun.  

Game did go a lot longer than 45 minutes but I think that's cause we were both new to the rules of making plays and so it took a little while to get in the flow.  

Definitely worth the $3.99 thrift hunt investment!

Looks very good! I just ordered a copy from Sarah and Thor at www.gamesurplus.com. I think folks who say this is Scrabble plus Ingenious have got it almost right. Or maybe all wrong. I don't think the Ingenious comparison really works, except perhaps aesthetically. Qwirkle really is, at its heart, a Scrabble variant. Instead of making words with letters, you make "words" with colors and shapes. I don't play Scrabble much anymore, since Montage came into my life, but this fresh variant gives the system new life and vitality. Even moreso than Scrabble, Qwirkle could be the perfect kind of game to play over coffee with a few non-gamer friends.

Update (5/11/07): Played a couple times with the kids. This one lives up to its promise. Refreshingly simple - read the rules once and you'll probably never have to refer to them again. Simply a joy to play. The patterns that develop on the board appeal to my sense of order and color. I think I would enjoy this as an activity even if there were no game attached.

I know I'll be playing this game regularly for many, many years. There aren't many new games I can say that about. An instant classic.

RATING: 5.75
A bit too abstract and tactical for my tastes. Still fun and enjoyable way to kill some time, but I think the whole "look on the board and calculate what move scores you the most points this turn" is a tad much. Similar problems I have with games like Five Tribes where if you could calculate every move it would be a near optimal strategy.

I've only played it with 3 people but I want to try with 4 players with 2 teams of 2.

I recall the hype from Qwirkle a few years ago and then the gamer-backlash against it. It's far from a perfect game, but simply knowing that there are 3 of each tile gives you just enough information to try and play tactically and cleverly. With 2 it was a good decision space between maximising your own score and minimising the scoring opportunities of your opponent. I suspect it might become more chaotic with more players, but I enjoyed Qwirkle quite a lot.

04-Sep-09: Bought Qwirkle last week. Mom and cynthia like it. A definite must for Rummy and Scrabble players!

29-Jul-10: We play a lot of Qwirkle at home. One weakness that we've found is a Start Player Disadvantage. The rules state that the person who can form the longest set starts. In most games, this means that the first player scores 3-4 points with his initial placement. The subsequent players then tend to form hooks off that first set, easily netting 6-8 points with their placements.

To counter this, we now play with the Scrabble Start, where the first player gets double points from his placement if less than 6 tiles (ie. not starting with a Qwirkle). That tends to even things out in the first round.

Qwirkle is fun, and the only negative for me is that it requires a lot of addition to keep all the points straight(not a very big problem). It's also a pretty quiet game, but requires a decent amount of strategy for how simple it is. not much player interaction, and there can be a fair bit of downtime with 4 players and people who either MUST have the best move or take a long time deciding what they want. However, it's a fun little strategy game!

RATING: 7
Very fun, quick playing game. There is definitely the possibility of the person on the right affecting one's scoring opportunities, so don't seat a strong player to the left of a newbie. The game reminds me of a combination of the Set Game and Scrabble, but with much less analysis paralysis. There is a fair amount of luck in the tile draw (draw many of the missing tiles to complete a Qwirkle and you'll win), but it is a light, fairly quick playing game that is easy for people to understand with about 1-2 minutes of explanation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
As a full meal, Qwirkle is just too silly to take seriously.  As fun filler, players get too much time to stare at their own 6 tiles and try to make the perfect play each turn, so too much AP slows the game to a chess-like crawl.  I much prefer Set Cubed instead.

Of the two abstract, pattern building games staring with the letter Q that can often be found in thrift stores I think Quarto is the better, deeper game. However, I do give Qwirkle extra credit for accommodating 2-4 players.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1

Excellent components and straightforward play make this a nice choice for playing with non-gamers.  The influence of the random draw is too great to be too serious about keeping score though (at least the way we play).  I'm not sure how much game is in there if people played very defensively - might be interesting to see how it feels with a more cutthroat crowd.  At this point, I'm not really interested in using this as a gateway - I'm not quite sure that Qwirkle has a path that leads anywhere.

Traded after 7 plays, but bought it back after the backlash from the rest of the family.

Based upon Chris Farrell review
This game does absolutely nothing for me. It's more pattern-matching exercise than game. It looks like Genius but I find it more similar to Carcassonne - looking for optimal tile placements that don't open up too much for your opponents - but even Carcassonne had more subtlety and interest than this. It's also much too long for what little is going on here, and egregiously prone to analysis paralysis amongst those so inclined (especially problematic in light of a scoring scheme which has a very high luck factor).

Bought on the wake of the Spiel des Jahres award this game is a sort of cross between Rummikub and Scrabble, this may not be a hardcore strategy choice but it is certainly an awful lot of fun. An ace family/entry game you score points by laying down tiles of the same colour or shape. Following players add to what is in play in order to try to capitalise of other players' successes. Each game is different as the shape of which play expands changes. We found that with more plays we moved to more conservative strategies unwilling to lay down 5 of a kind in case someone had the missing tile to complete a set. Tons of replayability; it really puts your observation skills to the test. The game is fanastic value for money - the wooden tiles are of a high quality and I imagine pretty much indestructable. Only negative comments I would say are: a) a bigger box would have been nice to store the bag containing the tiles (although I imagine some would be happy to ditch the box and just keep the bag out); b) a scoring sheet would have been a nice touch (but then again any piece of paper would do). I would strongly recommend this as an educational toy also.

RATING: 6
Fantastic simple mechanism. 6 colours, 6 symbols. It feels sooo familiar, but it makes up a great game ... in theory.

Actually it gets a bit dull when I play it because - when I play it against non-gaming family members - I win usually just by not giving 12-pointes away voluntarily (and keeping the 5th stone until I get the 6th as well).

It's a very good game to play with them, though, since they wouldn't be willing to play anything deeper.

Furthermore it's a game where I get annoyed by others laying tiles in a way that blocks further options. (That is when the other players do this without reckognizing what they're doing.)

I originally thought this was a very light dominoes like game to play with my young kids. Well it's a bit more complex than that and my 7 year old at one point said she was "bored, bored, bored" while playing with three adults who were trying to analyze too much to maximize points. In some ways it resembles scrabble (but with colors and shapes). Still it is a fun game that takes some creative planning, even though "qwirkles" if we were playing correctly (and I think we were after one false start) are not as common or easy to get as one would hope...although I did score a nice 20 points one round.

A lighter Scrabble variant with shapes and colors instead of word tiles. It is much lighter and not as strategic. While a sharp eye is required to spot the shapes and colors to maximize your score, luck of the draw in tiles play a huge role in the game. Drawing the correct tiles will allow you to score a Qwirkle and get bonus points. However, a few strategies can be employed to make scoring a Qwirkle tougher on your opponent(s). With two players, you have better control of the grid and it is a bit less chaotic. You can potentially plan ahead and have a good sense what the percentages are for drawing a specific tile from the bag. With more players, more tiles remain hidden and the desire to plan ahead is easily thwarted by your opponents. Therefore, I prefer to play this game with only two players.

The rules for this game is simple, yet it is a solid design with mass market appeal. The production values for this game is quite impressive. The blocks are solid and should stand up to repeated plays. This game though, cries out for a scoring table/board. Keeping track of the score each turn with a pen and paper is a royal pain in the behind. Hopefully future versions will include a score board. The Carcassone scoring board works quite well in this instance!

Qwirkle is a pattern recognition game that is easy to teach but difficult to master.  It allows for a wide variety of player ages and numbers.

I totally understand the appeal of a an abstract Scrabble with colors and shapes instead of letters, but this just doesn't do it for me. Luck of the draw becomes even more important, because all of the available plays are very easy to figure out, so there's little skill in placement. The only decision is whether to hold off on some tiles to see if you'll draw others to get the row of 6. That can be pretty frustrating. Furthermore, the importance of blocking the next player is heightened, making turn order and play style an important factor in who wins.

I think it would be more interesting if you could make a third row type, with no repeating shapes or colors. Or, if there was a board to play on, with bonus spaces of some sort.

Great game, except for issue with the components.  The black coloring on the tiles make for increased difficulty with looking at the tiles.

Really fun, fast abstract game, a kind of Scrabble with shapes and colors instead of letters. I consider it to be a must-have filler game. Go for the travel version, which is the exact same game, but less than half the price, and has smaller tiles that are easier to work with and won't hit up against the edge of your table; and they fit in a small zipped cloth square bag that is easy to take anywhere. 

There's also a newer version with cubes that you can role as dice, Qwirkle Cubes (2009), rated 6.58. Some folks like the cubes version better, but more seem to prefer the original better.

Oct 2017:
Finally purchased on sale at Target - wood tile version.  Played once so far and had a good time.  This, like Ingenious, is surprisingly challenging for having simple rules.  2P was a lot of fun, and I imagine it will scale well with more.  One person pulled ahead originally, but then scores ended up really close at the end.  We had a couple of rule confusion moments where we had to consult the book, but it will play even smoother next time!  Giving it 7 stars because it's a nice abstract game that can be played with people of all ages and types - new gamers, old gamers, kids, anyone.  I imagine you could even toss two sets together and have a (really long) game that could play with up to 8 players.  I can't tell yet if this or Ingenious will be my favorite "simple" abstract, but they're both ranked high.

I have the travel version in the zippered case.  I bought the smaller one for portability and so it would not take up so much playing space.  I had my husband cut down some Scrabble tile holders to fit these and they fit in the bag.  I also printed some score sheets and laminated them.  I think I got the original score sheet here but I modified it and made it double sided to go up to 200 points when just two people are playing.  I haven't had it long so we've only played it a few times but I see it having potential to become a favorite.

A fun tile laying game.  There are 3 each of 6 shapes with 6 colors (108 tiles).  Lines can consist of up to 6 tiles with the same shape in each color or 6 colors in different shapes.  You play as many tiles as you can in a sinlge line.  We played 4 players which takes some of the strategy out of the game.  By the time your turn comes around it's hard to predict what the board will look like.  It's fun and it's quick.

I think this is fun game for both adults and children. It's easy to learn while at the same time there's enough decision making and strategy to keep me engaged in each play. I like determining what tiles to hold on to and what tiles to play based on what I see on the board. Once you know the game, it can played quite fast. In fact I like it as two player, thirty minute filler game while waiting for longer games to end at our monthly game night.

It's Scrabble meets Dominoes (and I know I'm not the first person to make that comparison).  There are some interesting challenges in the game, since you have to pay attention to possible future moves as you make your current one.  I'm concerned that once two players know the game and make aggressive placements, the game will come down to whoever draws the right tiles at the right times.  It works fine as a 2- and a 3-player game (3-player possibly being the optimal number of players), but the 4-player game is too chaotic and unpredictable to be as enjoyable.

I dominos variant that should appeal to a wide age range; for younger children, it makes a wonderful education tool on the rudiments of mathematics (shape and colour matching and counting); for older children, the elements of strategy start creeping in and can be easily taught. For teens and adults, it can be used as a quick warm-up or filler game. There are deeper tile laying games, but for what it is, Qwirkle is an excellent design and the components solid, bright, and cheerful.

While Qwirkle is as simple as matching colors and shapes, it is a game that also requires tactical maneuvers and well-planned strategy. The game consists of 108 wooden blocks with six different shapes in six colors. Using the blocks, players attempt to score the most points by building lines that share a common attribute - either color or shape. Qwirkle is a quick game to learn, but you'll soon discover that you'll need to think strategically in order to score the most points.

An OK game. There's some strategy, but it seems that as long as you use the really general Scrabble strategy that your best move is often not the move that will get you the most points on any given single turn, it seems like the decisions are fairly obvious. Even then, there generally don't seem to ever be more than 2 or 3 viable moves on a turn. It sort of reminded me of Blokus, but with much more randomness and fewer options. I think if it didn't remind me so much of Blokus and suffer for the comparison (in my opinion) I'd probably be more keen on it; even as it stands now I'd play it, I just wouldn't take it over many other games.

Much lighter than I expected.  As others have said, it's basically Scrabble with colors and symbols instead of words.  On the one hand, that means there's no ambiguity about what is a valid move or not.  But it also saps the game of almost any potential for creative play.

After just a few games, the strategies are clear and the game basically comes down to luck of the draw.  Definitely less planning potential than similar light placement games like dominoes or Mexican Train.

Still an overall pleasant experience and easy to teach.  A fine light game for the family or in-laws.

Felt almost completely random.  There's probably a spatial placement element,  and you probably have to play to block qwirkles,  otherwise the strategy will boil down to who draws the most qwirkles.

This is a tough, enjoyable abstract game.  Its a safe game, so it could be good for families or new gamers.  But there is also some skill, and a more experienced player will probably win in the long term.

This game is great because it's so easy to learn, and nothing but fun.  Played numerous 4 player games with a group of non-gamers.  They loved it, and didn't want to stop playing.

Any game that my non-gaming friends don't want to stop playing (one of them wants to buy a copy now), is top notch in my books.

Nice and simple, you probably really have to think more than it seems. Only think that leaves me with some doubts: toward the end of the game you risk some brain-burning moments. I prefer to play it fast, without too much thinking.

[EDIT] lowered to 6.5 (from 7.3)... there really isn't much worth about it after all... quite shallow.

It's pretty cliche to say Qwirkle is like Scrabble with colors and shapes, but I still feel like it's the truth. Still, there's some difference there as you can only ever have either one of each color and all the same shape, or one of each shape and all the same color in any line or column. I like how relaxed the game tends to be and how it can be taught in minutes to almost anyone.

Dit spel ziet er vééél ingewikkelder uit dan het speelt (je moet het ergens tussen scrabble en domino situeren). Hoewel ik ergens het idee heb dat diegene met het beste ruimtelijke inzicht een grote voorsprong moet hebben zijn spelletjes hier doorgaans bijzonder spannend tot aan het eind. Mede daardoor is het ook iets waarvoor ik in de stemming moet zijn (ik heb al spelletjes gehad dat ik het gevoel had maar nutteloos zat mee te liften...en dan met een serie goede zetten plots nog won ook).

I'm a tile-laying, pattern-making kind of person, and I enjoy this game.  Simple, easy to explain and plays right away.  Nice chunky blocks and pretty.  Unfortunately, no one else in my family feels it deserves more than one play - they tired of it quickly.  Not a serious strategy game, but it has it's place. I would recommend this for families with younger children and non-gamers.

Played once (with 2 players). An interesting, easy abstract which could be summarized as "Ingenious meets Scrabble". Apart from the scoring, which has to be done with pen and paper (and is not that difficult), I suspect it is a great family game - but an enjoyable one, even for gamers. The components are also very good.

"Scrabble without the letters"; weird, but true and a fun game! Very family friendly, if you can match colors and patterns then you can enjoy putting down your "words."

Feels a lot like Ingenious.

Very nice chunky wooden tiles.

RATING: 7.5
Very solid family game.   Not something to pull out every time, but always enjoyable.  

Mechanically similar to Scrabble, but without the massive imbalance that comes up when one player has a far greater vocabulary than another and/or has memorized all of those stupid two-letter non-words that are technically allowed in Scrabble.

I like it. It is challenging but not as much as Set. You can play this with anybody as long as they do not hate pattern matching games. I find this a bit too close in scoring. I need to determine if there is a way to achieve a bit more play depth with this. This is definitely a keeper to play with the rummy set.

I can see where many people compare this game to [gameid=9674]; however, they are different games.  There are similarities, colored tiles that score points when in the right "lines."  I feel that Ingenious can become very cut-throat with obvious "take-that" moves.  Qwirkle has a more subtle strategy.  Blocking is important, but isn't as obvious (since you must place to score) which gives the appearance that it is more friendly.

My eldest daughters enjoy playing this.

Qwirkle is like Scrabble but with colors and shapes. It's the only game my dad requests to play, and it has gone over well with most people I've shown it to. Players can be competitive with minimal skill, but truly creative players are typically rewarded.

Very light Ingenious? More Flexible Dominoes?  A fairly light and fun tile layer about matching colors or shapes.  Would be wonderful for young kids except for the pen and paper scoring and number of "you can't play there" moments that go beyond matching (lines can't be more than 6 long...).  I'd rather play Ingenious or Carcassonne, but I wouldn't turn down a game of Qwirkle.

One of those light-hearted games that can be played at a leisurely pace while having conversations.  Has a broad appeal and is readily taught to the uninitiated.

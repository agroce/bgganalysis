It is a punishing game that keeps you on edge, and unlike every other LCG, you can't really be "behind".  What I mean by that is, you don't have to drop a ton of money to catch up.  You can buy the scenarios you want to play, or the expansions that have the cards you want to build the deck you want and move at your own pace because you're not playing against someone in a competitive setting.  Artwork is stunning and solo and cooperative play offer their own challenges and good times.

Initial thoughts are the scenarios (even the easy one) are way too hard for the pre-built decks in the box. This may be fine for the deck-builders who are happy to customs but the the likes of me who has little interest in this,or just a casual gamer, it make shte gme almost worthless. I'll persevere a while though. And an extra mark for the implementation of the theme.

My older brother bought all the expansions up to half of Heirs of Numenore packs (we share a collection)

EDIT: I like the game 7.5 and will therefore trade bulk adventure packs for Wishlist rating 1-2 (Must have-Love to have)

This is definitely one of my current favorites as it is handy for me to take on the road when I travel. I started when the game came out and have been keeping up with all the expansion packs and deluxe expansions. 

I own five copies of the base game and every deluxe expansion and expansions packs from each of the cycles. I also own the POD quests and playmats from various events. I also own a 4-player set of the wooden tokens made by Team Covenant.

The only thing I don't own are any of the nightmare quests and I am quite okay with that.

The biggest thing that surprised me about this game is how thematic it is. I was simply expecting a cool card game with pretty cards. Not only did I get that, but the missions, the choices you have, the cards, and the card effect all make so much sense thematically. If you are a Tolkien fan you will NOT be disappointed. The game takes you (and you band of heroes that you can choose) on a journey within Middle Earth with varying tasks, enemies, and locations to explore. 

Another thing that surprised me was how great of a Solo game this is. Not too take away from the co-op aspect of this game - it is definitely one of the best - if not the best - 2 player (co-op) game I've played. But its by far the best solo-player game I've played (admittedly I haven't played very many, but I guess that's because I never appealed to me in the first place.)

If you've been researching this game, no doubt you've heard about plethora of expansion packs and something called 'deck-building.' As for expansions, I haven't purchased any yet, though I plan to because there is a lot more adventures that I'd love to go on! There's even a fan expansion with cards and quests to do with the First Age! 
As for deck-building, my only experience with that has been with Pokemon cards back when I was a young kid :P
I haven't actually put together my own deck yet, and before buying this game I'll admit I wasn't to stoked about it, but after getting a bunch of games in using the pre-made decks, I can see the appeal, and even necessity of it to get the most out of this game. I look forward to the day I get more cards, and can start putting together my own 'deck of adventurers' and go on more quests! All that said, I haven't done any of that yet and still enjoy this game immensely.

Anyways, I really think this is a well designed game. It really doesn't feel like a 'card game' to me but instead an adventure in Middle Earth. If that interests you, then I definitely recommend this game to you.

My ultimate solo game :) its hard enough for me to recreate my decks. Got to play with fellow LOTR LCG fans as well, quite an experience.

RATING: 7
Enjoyed the LOTR theme, and the game was inelligently made. I bought it for solo play, which made the game VERY difficult. Playing solo as two players is better, but circling the table over and over isn't the best experience. Still enjoy the depth of the game, and it made me want to buy expansions. Definite bonus that it made me crave more and think way to long about deck building strategy, but negative points for the high cost for only 3 single (and one or two ridiculously hard, given the limited player cards) scenarios. Would maybe bump up the score if I had a gaming partner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I do like this game quite a bit -- enjoying both the theme and the way the game mechanics work. A couple ticks: 1. I bought it for solo play, which is MUCH harder than I thought it would be (playing solo as two players is fine but not my favorite). 2. There are only three scenarios included, one of which is fairly impossible to win without shedding more money out on extra cards/expansions. Still fun but a nuisance. I enjoy the rigorous deck building but not the necessity to spend tons of money to build something great. If I had someone else to play with who was also into deck building, I'd probably raise my rating a notch or two.

Reserving rating until more time with this title. So far, it's kicking our butts.

Update: One victory (Spirit), many losses (assorted). The theme is captured nicely. The "excruciating decision making" aspect of the game helps capture the challenge of the storyline as well. So far, we really enjoy this title.

It is hard to love this game the first time you try it as there are not enough cards and the adventures are complicated.

But as you go along your imagination starts to fly and you try to build thematic decks.

A very enjoyable game that I think I will be playing for quite a long time.

With four players this was a snooze-fest. Not challenging at all at any point. I've no desire to play it again. Of course, we may have been doing something wrong but from comments online it sounds like we weren't. Probably a lot more tense and tactical with fewer players. Few strategic options as well and the "threat" (aggro) component wasn't punishing enough.

Seems like this is finnaly going to be my LCG. Story driven Quests were what I was starving for, and here they are. Different expansion decks telling a different story seem like a great idea. Overall mechanics intriguing enough.And the possibility to play it solo or cooperatively just sold it for me.

And Fantasy setting is my all time favorite. Of course, Lord of the Rings, my bible. When is it coming?

Finnally here. Living to my expectations so far, and that is a lot to say (not many games do). Narrative is here, quest stages feel like a story, every quest is like a different puzzle where you need to adapt your deck strategies to survive...

Plays great solo and looking forward to some cooperative games. And the art is fantastic. Now I canÂ´t wait for next chapters coming out.

Might make it to my Top 10 faster than I thought.

Art is superb, gameplay terrible. It's like doing a sudoku puzzle with a Lord of the Rings themed pencil.

This is possibly my favorite game, but I can't justify the LCG format. I would rank it higher if it were more affordable and if the average card quality were higher or more consistent; the core set in particular has some really lame cards (and some excellent ones). I'd be very interested in a revised edition that was also more affordable.

Apart from those issues, I'd rate this a 9.5. It's my favorite co-op.

I don't think it can be overstated how great this game is. It actually works! Unlike many card games that depend on luck luck luck. This one has some actual strategy and reward for shrewd thinking. And what's more, is that, as a fan of LotR and The Hobbit, you are in for a treat with some of the awesome character cards and parties you can build.

RATING: 10
After many, many plays of this game, I still find it to be an excellent game with lots of options and tough decisions to be made.  However, it has started to feel somewhat samey to me as my wife and I have done the same quests to death.  I'll continue to play the game, and I'm sure the first expansion pack will re-energize my interest, but right now I'm feeling tired of the game, thus I've downgraded my rating from a 9.5 to an 8.5.

UPDATE (11-6-13): The comments above were written 5-30-11, back when the game was brand new and a delay in the release of the first expansion caused the game to feel a bit played out.  I can say now, almost two and a half years later, that the game is and has been my second favorite game for quite some time.  It's simply a fantastic game system that has been constantly evolving and breaking new ground with each expansion.  There are so many expansions out now that I haven't even been able to play all of them, and the game has maintained a high level of quality with all of its releases that I've played.  I can see myself playing the game for many more years to come.

(Solo)
4/13/13 - After 7 plays i've played the first scenario exclusively as i've tried to learn how it all works. Spirit looks to be the foundation of any successful deck at this point. It's questing and enemy nullification cards make it indispincible. Leadership pairs nicely with it, with solid resource generation and versatility. Lore is good for support with healing and card draw. I haven't had much luck with Tactics, the only sphere where i've lost a hero...both times Gimli. 

As far as deck construction; it really comes down to finding what you like, or want to accomplish and then build it carefully. A big part is concentration vs. versatility. The more concentrated a deck is, the more frequent you will get the cards you need, but you wont be able to do things outside your zone. The more versatile your deck is, the better able you will be to meet various challenges, but you'll find yourself with more unneeded cards in your hand.

4/20/13 - After much himming and hawwing, I came to the realization tht i'm just not in love with this game. Not enough to countinue down the rabbit hole at this time. it's a solid, beautiful game, but it just doesn't grab me. I think it's too mechanical. When I look at Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli, I don't see characters; I see stats and abilities. It's the same way throughout the game. While the mechanics are good, there are too many other games out and coming soon to pump $200 - $300 in this system, espically when so many of the expansion cards are trash. I believe I have enough to be happy for now.

RATING: 9
Only ever played this Solo but as a solo game this is fantastic. Can be a bit of a money sink if you collect all the expansions but there is hours, if not hundreds of play time here. Combines deck building (no single deck can defeat all quests) and excellent solo gameplay. Fantastic.

RATING: 5.85
A Lord of the Rings themed cooperative game?  Awesome!  Well, except I'm not so sure the cooperative part of it really works out so well.  Most of the scenarios have fairly clear strategies that must be utilized for the heroes to win, so it isn't really a game of "assemble whatever deck you'd like and go off on an adventure."  Generally decks have to be assembled with the specific goal of completing a specific scenario, which means that the game is cooperative only so far as you discuss with your companions what the correct strategy is for whatever scenario you've chosen to play.

Once everyone is playing by the dictated strategy to complete the particular scenario, it doesn't really feel like every player (or any player) is adding continual input to make the game feel cooperative.  

Works okay as a solitaire, though.  Nice art in the game, also.

RATING: 7
Got this mainly because it's great in solo mode.  It's also *tough*.  In solo play it's almost impossible to succeed at the last campaign unless editing the base deck and getting a bit lucky. Some would say that the game is too difficult and that this is rather transparent ploy to force you to buy more cards... Anyway, it's a decent price for the base set, with great art work and nice components, so maybe buying an expansion or two isn't unreasonable.  Great theme and fans of LOTR, co-ops and fantasy genre will really enjoy this.  Shame it's hard to get hold of the expansions.

RATING: 6
I have only played the introductory quest thrice. Lot's of fases but not that many decisions. And it's actually pretty easy to win, unless I'm playing it wrong (there's a snare card that you can use in the introductory quest, that imobilizes your engaged enemy you attach it to, for the rest of the game. And also late in the game, you have maybe 5-6 allies open together with your heroes...).

I've played this more than just about any other game in my collection, as it was my go-to solo game for a long time. The mission structure is great and keeps it fresh for much longer than most solo games fare. Would be higher, but docked for the sheer amount of grey areas in the rules.

Very fun, but I think that I'm going to need to get some expansions to really get into the deckbuilding aspect of the game. 

6/2015 - I have now played the passage through mirkwood expansion twice with each starter faction.  The next quest seems a bit difficult but I might give it a try.  Been meaning to get Kelly's take on this, but I'm probably going to be getting some saga expasions either way. 

8/2015 - Wow has this game been a hit for me the last couple of months!  I worked though the entirety of the Black Riders expansion with a self-built hobbit deck.  I need to tackle some more expansion content and look forward to continue improving my deck.

Having said that, this is a lovely looking game with a very interesting play order. It is nice that it can be played coop or solo and can easily be played in 30 to 45 minutes on easy level.

Playing one-handed seems very difficult without constructing decks (see first comment).

As the challenge seems to come before the game is played, it isn't a game I want to continually play.

Bought on June 4th 2011 at the UK Games Expo, Birmingham. FFG have made an error here in that the number of cards available in this core set is in my opnion insufficient to provide a good variety of games, and even to allow any success at the harder two out of only three scenarios provided. Another 30 cards for aother 5$ or Â£ would have helped hugely. So to feel pressured into buying a SECOND core set just to make it work is poor. The other LCGs available are not as bad as this one for this sort of error. Call of Chthulu and Game of thrones DO play well enough out of the core set. This is a bitch to win esp. solo. Excellent, excellent ideas and artwork and quality let down by insufficient material.

A very good game which is so time-consuming on the one hand and expensive on the other hand that selling my childeren to some human smugglers seemed the only solution to kill those two birds with one stone... luckily I have no children! (anymore?)

So all of the characters that you would expect are in the game or will be but the game doesn't feel scripted. But there still has to be a good game there somewhere and I think there is. I like that the game is cooperative. That aspect really seems to fit the theme very well. I like that there is a solo element to the game. That allows you to test decks easily and try new ideas. The gameplay itself is pretty intuitive and the games don't take long to play. The adventures are a nice idea and I like that each has it's own set of encounter cards. That gives each one it's own unique feel. It would be nice if there were more of them but that's what the adventure packs are for. 

Many have said that the game doesn't "feel" like LotR. I understand the criticism but it really doesn't bother me at all. There are so many new elements in the game and so far the story lines are not coming from the book but are derived from them tangentially. I can understand where a lot of the cards originate but most are not mentioned in the books. So yeah, it's hard to "feel" like LotR without a lot of very specific cards that currently don't exist. I think that this will improve a lot as more cards become available. I know that the tactics deck got a big boost and certainly became more tied to the books with the introduction of the eagles in the 1st adventure pack. Also, I really don't 'feel' like a farmer when I play Agricola either but I still enjoy that game.

[8/22/11]
After more plays and a couple of iterations of the FAQ things have cleared up quite a bit. Some of the wording and definitions are a bit unclear but the FAQ does a good job of clearing things up. It would be nice if they were a bit more intuitive. Still it's a pretty solid game. I've played with the 1st and 2nd adventure packs and base game adventures so far but I like what I saw. It looks like each adventure pack will have a different feel. I've also acquired a 2nd copy of the game through a trade and that has made a big difference. Playing 50 card decks is the way to play this game. Of course that now makes one of the three adventures in the starter set completely obsolete and another substantially easier. The most difficult scenario in the starter pretty much requires 50 card decks and two copies of the game anyway so at least that one is still worth playing. So at the moment it kind of sucks having only 3 adventures that will challenge you most games. 

For those of you that aren't interested in building decks you can check out this list of decks for use in the game:

Fairly new to the game, It has been a blast. Solo or co-op it has been fun each and every time.  The only down side to the game, is how much money you have to put into it for the expansions, cycles, and card sleeves. I still think it will be worth the money!!

RATING: 10
My newest obsession. This card game is very addictive, grants many routes to success, and holds true to the classic Tolkien mythos. It's very unique in the sense that it is a co-op game of players version encounter decks, and the constantly expanding LCG releases give new and challenging quests very frequently. I HIGHLY recommend this game.

3 for solo play. There's just no joy to be found here. Incredibly nasty events and cruel game mechanics from hell. + the playtime is too long for this torture. Can't be saved by the pretty albeit generic fantasy pictures.

It's growing on me.  It's taken some time to get the rules down.  It will take even longer to understand the effects of the cards, and the best way to build a deck.  I am not much of deck building gamer (up to this point), so I'm not sure how to go about it.  (At least I'm not competing against others with this game.)

I love the feeling and the atmosphere. The game actually lies in cooperating to [i]prepare[/i] [decks] for the quest at hand. Sending your decks off to beat a scenario is very exciting...

... Dwarf theme, please...

I love places, and this game takes you places. It really feels like an adventure!

The game is best with 2 players.

But it has problems as a game. Theoretically a solitaire game even though two players "cooperate." Also, You must know your cards really well to build decks well. This is time consuming and not really part of the game. I think I would prefer to study Chess or Luna or some other game with almost no luck than to spend time learning the canon of cards and card effects that I might not draw in-game anyway. And you must get many expansions to have real options for the game in the first place, and so it is expensive to boot. One gets more satisfaction out of studying a single game like Luna or El Grande or Chess than one gets from buying tons of little "games" in the LOTR:LCG series. That is, as a "game." If you're going for theme, immersion in fantasy, and a cooperative ride with a friend or family member, then the game definitely delivers.

Don't own this game and have been afraid to as I see an LCG as a money sink. However, after so many plays and with how much I enjoy the game I am ready to take the plunge into my first LCG and this is it. It's very tactical and the way your decks evolve is fun and not overwhelming as you add a few cards with each expansion. I'm sure it gets more overwhelming after you get so many expansions and have to revisit old cards that were once useless and see that it has some cool synergy with some of the newer cards. Played this when I first was introduced to newer board games a few years ago and after playing now over 100 different games over
that time. This remains a favorite for me. Great game. *Update. Own it and love it.

RATING: 7
A relatively fast-playing co-op, with heroes and monsters and all the other things you'd expect a Lord of the Rings adventure game to be made of, plus enough flexibility in deck construction/customization to keep my inner CCGer happy.

After building a deck and choosing one of the scenarios (which determines the subset of enemies, locations, and other bad stuff you'll face), the game follows a fairly simple structure of alternate questing and fighting steps, with plenty of points where the players can play cards, and an upkeep step after fighting.

You can play with two players with the base game alone, though we found that the number of cards meant we felt a bit constrained while deckbuilding.  We purchased the Khazad-Dum expansion, and now there's a bit more room for customization.

Components, though it's a card game and they only consist of cards, tokens, and a pair of threat counters, are high-quality.  I sleeved the game, but it's certainly not necessary for the non-OCD.  The rulebook is also laid out well, and makes a game with a fairly simple rule set easy to learn.

EDIT: The more I play of this, the less I like it.  It seems like every game we play of this, regardless of whether we win or lose, the outcome is determined early on.  When we win, it's because we were able to clear the staging area early, which allowed us to quest conservatively and travel/fight to keep the staging area clear.  

When we lose, we had been unable to quest successfully early on, either because of high doom values or because threatening enemies have required our attention.  Unsuccessful quests mean locations get completed slowly, and questing phases get more desparate, but the enemies also don't get dealt with, and once a hero dies, there is no recovery.

The best adventure card game there is. What most people appears to see as a weakness (the deckbuilding), I see as one of the greatest strenghts of the game. I always liked to build a deck before playing. Yes its a lot of packs if you deciding to start play now, but you can choose packs from what decks you wanna play in the beginning and go from there.

Nice deck building game. Highly thematic. Its actually a cooperative game (new approach for deck building games) with players working together against the encounter deck (different enemy cards according to the scenario) in order to accomplice the scenario's requests. Scenarios are of variable difficulty. Great artwork on the cards. The game also supports solo play and is good at it. But only 3 scenarios included?? Shame on you FFG. 

Update after 100 plays: Ok this game is great and I am addicted. I bought everything from Mirkwood, Dwarrowdelf, Against the Shadow, Ringmaker, Angmar Awakens nad the Dreamchaser cycles.

Update after 200 plays: The latest cycles are excellent. Much better story and more advanced mechanics. Great stuff, Icant stop playing. BBut now I am spoiled and I dont want to play Mirkwood Cycle again. Seems so boring and shallow. 

Rating starts as a 7 during the first cycle and goes up to a 9 at the latest cycles because the scanario design and theme gets progressively better.

Bought to play solo (and have still only ever played solo). It works pretty well, though getting started is pretty tough - it seems to be so hard at first. It really requires deck building, despite the misleading positioning as playable out of the box, as single sphere decks have limited power. It could do with more official scenarios. Of course, this is a very good reason for wanting the expansion packs, and the game will only really shine when more has been added to it. But the core is certainly playable as it is, and you will get your money's worth if that is all you buy.

Not all the player cards in the core set come in threes, though they do in the expansions. The number of player cards in the core set is such that they could have provided 2 of each (well, all but 1, but they could have done 14 cards per sphere and added another neutral card, or provided 4 more player cards by removing cards elsewhere). Several of the most useful cards only come with 1 copy. This appears to be just gouging from FFG to persuade people to buy two or three core sets just to get those 'missing' cards.

I have only played solo, but from comments on here, and just from looking at the instructions, it is clear that there are scalability problems, where the same scenario varies enormously in difficulty depending on the number of players. Of course, once you know what the real difficulty is, by number of players, that sort-of does not matter. The lack of balance smacks of lack of playtesting, or, more likely, an acceptance that it is difficult to balance well, and a couldn't give a damn about the consequence. 

Whilst the rules are generally pretty good (and there is a good official video series), the inconsistencies and ambiguous wording on many of the cards (and wording on the cards overrides the rules) and the documentation (or complete lack thereof) about card effects and interactions is very poor, requiring lots of FAQ entries and rule clarifications. Their playtesters must have been awful (or, more likely, not reading the cards because they 'knew' what they did) to have not noted all those ambiguities.  That or they were noted but failed to make it into any documentation. Whatever the reason, the mess does not do FFG any credit.

The quality of the physical bits is excellent. A very sturdy box, nice quality cards, generally excellent artwork, good quality thick tokens and threat trackers.

This is my first, and probably my last, FFG game. I would undoubtedly have given a higher score if it was not just so poorly developed. Very polished presentation, but it is all superficial. If they had spent as much time on the game as they did on the glitz, it would probably have been very good indeed.

I freaking love this game. A cooperative collectible game, who knew? Also Fantasy Flight's commitment to the game is yielding some pretty awesome expansions. I am currently subscribed to the monthly packs at TeamCovenant.com so I don't even have to worry about keeping up to date. My only grievance is that I have a hard time keeping track of all card effects in the game. I suspect it is because it is the only co op game of its kind and myself and the other players do not feel the need to keep each other honest.

I went in to this game favorably disposed towards it, and after stumbling with the starter Tactics deck initially, I did a bit of deck building and enjoyed it with the Mirkwood scenario.  But then I realized that the other scenarios just didn't feel like fun and I simply don't feel like playing the game any further.  I set it up for the Anduin scenario one evening, stared at everything, then put it all back in the box.  

I think the true problem is that the game really bothers me from a lore/story perspective; I know that's silly, but are we to believe that Denethor, Aragorn, Eowyn, Legolas, Gimli, and Bilbo are all tearing around Mirkwood or hunting for Gollum?  

Anyway, the art is great and the components are excellent, so that's something.  I'm glad a lot of people enjoy the game, but it's not for me.

Ranged - exhaust to deal 1 damage to an enemy in the staging area
Sentinel - exhaust to add Defense to another character's Defense against an attack.

Or

When playing solo only include one copy of each encounter card in the encounter deck. For some quests you must however include multiples of some cards. In addition the player's deck's minimum size is reduced to 20 (or 25, still experimenting) cards, but may include only a single copy of each card. The changes to the encounter decks have reduced runs of bad luck immensely and made the quests slightly more predictable. You also don't have to include as many cards in your player deck to counter the worst encounter cards. Reducing the size of the player deck makes that more predictable and allows faster access to key cards. The limit to one copy of each player card on the other hand counterbalance the changes that make the game easier and force you to use cards that would otherwise be rarely used. A nice side effect is that such player decks only require one core set

Bombadil variant: each hero begins the game with a single progress token on them. At any time during the game, a player can have a hero they control sing the song (removing the progress token) to activate one of the following effects, of their choice:

Heal that hero 1 damage. Ready that hero. That hero gains +1 Willpower until the end of the phase. That hero gains +1 Attack until the end of the phase. That hero gains +1 Defense until the end of the phase.

Apart from solo games, I have only played this once, and it was a little better than OK. As a solo game, it is far too difficult. If your starting hand is not (almost) perfect, you may as well start again. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. For example trying the second of the base scenarios with the cards available at the time (only cards from the base set and the first cycle). Even choosing your starting hand you are in the lap of the gods with the shadow draw. 

I do like the scaling up of difficulty with 2 players, it appears to be a nice mechanic. After a few plays, I am more certain that the game is almost entirely luck based and what cards come up. It is a very average solo game more like a puzzle of getting the right combination of cards to get through the scenario.

The only LCG I play, and it is fantastic!  The art is top tier.  I wish I could play this more than I do.  I play scenarios at about half the rate at which I purchase them, at best!  Happy that as time goes on there are more interesting deck ideas, that is, other than Dwarf dwarf dwarf ...

RATING: 8.5
A truly exceptional co-op card game, that brings together theme, story and interesting gameplay 'puzzles' (in various forms). I'd be tempted to rate this much higher, as it is a personal favourite. It both scratches my deckbuilding urges and is a much easier game to teach/play for less competitive players than FFG's other LCGs - while still offering real challenges. It also taught me a great deal about narrative in gaming.

Before I jump into a few technical criticisms, some more great stuff: the art is stellar (look no further than Magali Villeneuve's contributions), the game continues to evolve in interesting directions, and the community/fansites are welcoming and great to interact with.

Two things holding this game back: 
-A core set that a completionist/deckbuilder will feel the urge to buy more than 1 of, despite steeply diminishing returns (due to the encounter cards).
-A timing/rules structure reminiscent of the Game of Thrones LCG that pre-dates some the considerable improvements made in later LCGs since. While being cooperative rather than competitive eases the burden of knowledge, there's still some pretty arcane quirks.

I think this game rules.  It took me a while to get the hang of, but now that I've got it, it plays smoothly  and is a lot of fun, not to mention challenging.  I think the only drawback for me is having to build adventure specific decks.  That takes away from being able to sit down and quickly play.  But still, one of my favs.

Excellent game, really thematic, but i have a few issues with it: 
The setup is huge, especially if you must make your deck depending on the mission you choose.
And the cards, and especially heroes, are not equal at all. It's really hard to make a good use of some of the weaker heroes and cards, so you often end up with same combinations over and over. 

However, the setup thing makes it arelly reaching the table, lately.

My favourite LCG and quite simply one of the best cooperative/solo games around in its genre! 

The components are fantastic, and infinitely expandable as the inevitable expansions arrive. It's extremely simple to get the hang of, and setup is extremely easy.

Yet the game itself is supremely tense, and is fully cooperative with everyone chipping in towards a common goal. There is no splitting up to achieve different objectives as in some other coops. Everyone is in the same focus all the time.

A great game with an awesome theme - it's no surprise that it has rocketed up my top 10 list. I had been waiting for this game for quite awhile, and frankly expected it to underwhelm, but boy am I glad to be so wrong!

Now this game has something to do with Lord of the Rings as you work your way through the world and story of Tolkein's Middle Earth. Spectacular art and intense gameplay make it the best of FF's LCGs and probably one of the better card games in the business. The only thing that keeps it at a 7 is there is too much power creep the further along in the adventures you go. And with that happening the deck you had for that adventure isn't going to work in this adventure. So with each new play we have to remake our decks to have a better chance. Yes. Yes. We know that for some people that retooling of your decks as the story gets more difficult is the best part. But for us it becomes a bit of a chore.

Played 2 games solo. So far, not so good. I have to say that I find the game a little dull and there is just too much "up keep" in place of actual game play. 

Having said this, I will change this score after a few games if I find it good. Hell, as I said, I have only played it 2 times solo. Will have a 2 player game soon.

En mi breve experiencia, he visto que peca de lo mismo que todos los LCG. SobreexplotaciÃ³n del negocio.

Sin ser un mal juego, el excesivo nÃºmero de expansiones acaba por agobiar. AdemÃ¡s de que los personajes/objetos/lugares mÃ¡s atrayentes no aparecen hasta que no has comprado unos cientos de cartas. MuchÃ­simas de ellas son mero "relleno".

El juego, sin estar mal, no da para vender miles de cartas, en mi opiniÃ³n.

Si te conformas con tener solo una parte, y no todas las aventuras/personajes, entonces puede ser una opciÃ³n. Si eres completista, ni lo intentes.

Con Juego de Tronos ya tuve suficiente para ver el concepto LCG y no picar en ninguno mÃ¡s, por mucho que me guste el tema.

Very thematic...and moreso as the expansions progress. Mechanics are very simple and co-operative gameplay is fantastic. Love the combination of flexibility and sticking to the Tolkien legendarium that characterize this game.

...Ultimately, though, collectible games like this are too costly for what they provide in terms of gameplay. Hard to invite others in who are not already players. Someday, perhaps, the perfect LotR game will come along. Until then...sigh.

Mein erstes LCG Spiel, HDR Thema
Trotz Videotutorial bisher nicht wirklich in das Spiel rein gekommen. Im 2 Spielermodus mit Frank sind wir gescheitert und auch im Solomodus ging das Spiel unrÃ¼hmlich zu Ende.
Vielleicht fehlt mir der nÃ¶tige Biss um hier weiter zu kommen.
Die Spielidee und auch die AusfÃ¼hrung, d.h. die QualitÃ¤t der Karten gefallen mir schon sehr gut. Daher habe ich mir auch direkt folgende Erweiterungen zugelegt (bevor die aus dem Handel verschwinden was bei LCG Spielen wohl mal passieren kann):
[thing=94288]Auf der Jagd nach Gollum[/thing]
[thing=95338]Der Kampf am Carrock[/thing]

My first night of several games have brought me this input: It is incredibly challenging to win with the pre-built single sphere decks. It plays JUST like a CCG including the fiddly and seemingly incomplete rules. Quite an involved and invigorating game though.

RATING: 8
Plays best with 2-4 players. While the game works perfectly well as a solo experience playing one character (yes, you could play up to 4; but trying to co-ordinate optimum card play could be a drag), most missions can prove very difficult to win. I find this mainly a game of risk assesment/management: in a solo game your best play is obvious and the order of cards in your draw deck will dictate victory or defeat.

RATING: 5
Two plays, two players.  Flat-out steamrolled the first scenario and found the whole affair boring, questioning why I wouldn't attack with all but one of my bajillion allies every turn.  The second scenario was much more challenging, but I concluded that the underlying game mechanics aren't sufficiently interesting to me in order to generate interest in deckbuilding.  For me, the former has to precede the latter, although several people - like my opponent - enjoy deckbuilding more, and don't concern themselves as much with the underlying engines.  I thought it was playable.  I was glad that I was taught the rules, given the surprising length of the rulebook.  If you're an LOTR or deckbuilding nut, maybe it's for you.  It's harder for me to see excitement in the mechanics, though.

RATING: 5
[co-op card combat, 1-4 players]

==original thoughts==
Only own the core set.  Replaced the terrible insert with UltraPro deck boxes.

Set up and teardown are longer than I normally like, and teaching the game's rhythm is hard.  This plus the long game dureation means I've only started three sessions of this game (one session was adjourned because the night grew too late for my roommate).  If I had the right group, this might come out more often.

The game doesn't scale well for different player counts.  I can't beat the first scenario alone, but it was feasible at 2 and easy at 3.  Haven't played 4.

==2017/11/19==
Maybe I don't like co-ops?

This game is a small mountain of rules.  Each turn has seven-ish phases, and there's SO MUCH card text to read.  And after you climb that mountain, the decisions are pretty obvious.  Eowyn always quests, Aragorn always wants the killing blow.  After learning the game and teaching the game, you're rewarded with a simple set of decisions.

Also, this is a game with "card screw", where you don't draw the cards you actually want.  You don't turn through your deck enough to reliably get the cards you want, and some cards in your hand are just crap.

Maybe the game would be more fun if I could build my own deck?  If the choices in the real game aren't very fun, then maybe the interesting choices are in deckbuilding.  That means dropping more money on the game though, and I don't even like it.

My preferred means of visiting this fictional universe in game form...the amount of customization here is nearly on a Magic level, or it will be when there are enough cards. I enjoy it solo or co-op, and the difficulty ratings for the various scenarios are pretty accurate in how my games have played out. The artwork is also unparalleled among all the LCGs I've seen, gorgeous renderings that should please fans of both the novels and the films. Really an excellent game, one I will play for years.

Ultimately, I decided that the CCG/LCG format just doesn't work for a co-op game.

Unless you are the 'only a few games play I' type.  and you have several friends of like persuasion.  At that point, the deckbuilding becomes a shared activity to be discussed and debated, instead of a task lumped on the game owner which will rarely be appreciated by the future participants, unless deck failure occurs, in which case it creates a bad game experience.

key point to remember, deckbuilding LCGs still require more investment in the game (mindshare) than fixed deck games.

Talk about a game that is extremely difficult and unforgiving at times. Every decision is critical to surviving in Middle Earth. It takes too much time to figure out what decks to build, but there are a lot of sites that give you deck builds to use. Great Great game and its amazing and fun solo

I bought this on a whim while on a business trip.   I was bored, the reviews were great, and the next stop on my trip was my girlfriend; I liked the idea of a co-op game to play with her, since I just don't see her as a wargamer, and she loves LOTR.

After initially feeling overwhelmed by the rules, I set up the game in my hotel room and eventually figured out the mechanics.  I lost interest in the game pretty quickly.  Maybe deck-building games just aren't for me (although I love Dominion).  It reminds me a bit of Sentinels of the Multiverse, a game I bought with high expectations, only to find the gameplay too difficult to make the game enjoyable.

One thing I found frustrating was simply the disorganization of the game play area.  Maybe I just need a bigger table to play on.

One lesson learned:  I need to pay more attention to the negative comments.  When you pull up comments for a game, it defaults to the higher ratings first, and the glowing reports can tempt one to purchase a game without due diligence.

In any event, I'm packing up the game now with no particular desire to pull it out again.  I may try it one more time if I'm feeling desperate.  Otherwise, it's just going on the shelves.

UPDATE:  Played through a whole solo scenario.  Upgraded from 3 to 5.5, based on my willingness to give it another try or two.  May be more enjoyable with two players.  As it is, still doesn't hold much appeal.

after a couple plays I have to say Im pretty intruiged by this one.  I cant quite tell if everything that's happening is just "busy work" or if there's an actually game here but I enjoyed my plays of it so far.

******

A few more plays now and still enjoying this game despite the fact that it doesn't seem to offer much in the way of meaningful decisions.  Deciding which resources to spend and when, while deciding who to quest with, who to hold back for combat, and who to exhaust (tap) for special powers are all interesting on the surface, but ultimately its the turn of the cards that seem to dictate success of failure. 

Like many games of this sort, the real juicy decisions come in the spaces between the game, where players build their decks in order to prepare for the journey ahead -- gearing up for the journey is half the fun!  The scenarios are varied and decks that work against one won't likely perform so well against another.  You build a deck, throw it against the scenario, tinker, and repeat.  While it may sounds a little "mechanical" it's quite enjoyable.

Still there is much to enjoy here and so far there are a lot of clever little ways in which the game play lines up nicely with the individual quests.  The game does a good job of telling a story while making you feel like you are a part of it.

The last issue is the co-op nature of it.  How well does the game foster that sense of working together with a friend in order to overcome a difficult challenge?  Some of this comes back to deck building.  A sort of "I'll build something to fight the monsters while you put together a questing or healing deck".  There are also a few abilities that some cards have that foster that same sort of "we're in this together" feeling.  But overall it's not QUITE as engaging as a co-op when compared to something like Pandemic or Space Alert.

One last thing.  If you really want to enjoy this game and all it has to offer (as far as deckbuilding) I think you need to drop some cash on adventure packs.  Probably not much of a surprise, but also sort of a bummer.

A Netrunner utÃ¡n ez a 2. LCG amit prÃ³bÃ¡lok. Nos, szerintem szÃ­nvonalban nem igazÃ¡n van kÃ¼lÃ¶nbsÃ©g, de nagyon mÃ¡s jellegÅ± a kettÅ. A Netrunner erÅssÃ©gÃ©t az aszimmetrikus lehetÅsÃ©gek jelentik, ezt a jÃ¡tÃ©kot pedig a kooperatÃ­v volta teszi kÃ¼lÃ¶nlegessÃ©. RÃ¶vid idÅn belÃ¼l a 2. olyan jÃ¡tÃ©kom, amit azÃ©rt vettem, hogy egyedÃ¼l is tudjak jÃ¡tszani. A Pathfinder ezzel Ã¶sszevetve mÃ¡s, sokkal nagyobb szabadsÃ¡got ad, Ã©s egyedÃ¼l sokkal kÃ¶nnyebb is. Ott a lÃ©tszÃ¡m nÃ¶velÃ©sÃ©vel lesz nehezebb a jÃ¡tÃ©k, de a LOTR Ã©pp ellenkezÅleg, egyedÃ¼l tÅ±nik nagyon nehÃ©znek. MÃ¡r a 2. pÃ¡lyÃ¡t is teljesen esÃ©lytelennek Ã©reztem, igaz egy nagy hibÃ¡t elkÃ¶vettem (a fenÃ©be, most nÃ©zem, hogy az a 3. pÃ¡lya volt, nem vÃ©letlen, hogy megszÃ­vtam, 7-es nehÃ©zsÃ©gÅ±, elsÅre kicsit nagy falat volt). ÃsszessÃ©gÃ©ben tetszik a rendszere, vÃ¡ltozatosak a kÃ¼ldetÃ©sek, tetszik hogy pontozva is van a kÃ¼ldetÃ©s, Ã­gy van Ã¶sszehasonlÃ­thatÃ³sÃ¡g. ElkÃ©pesztÅen sok kieg jelent meg hozzÃ¡, lehet vÃ¡logatni:) A SAGA kiegekrÅl jÃ³t hallottam, ezek a kÃ¶nyvek alapjÃ¡n kÃ©szÃ¼ltek, majd lehet hogy beszerzem Åket, ha Ãºgy Ã©rzem, hogy tÃ©nyleg jÃ³l mÅ±kÃ¶dik szÃ³lÃ³ban, vagy talÃ¡lok egy rendszeres partnert hozzÃ¡.

DurvÃ¡n nehÃ©z ez a jÃ¡tÃ©k szÃ³lÃ³ban. MÃ©g az 1. kÃ¼ldetÃ©snÃ©l szenvedek, easy mÃ³dban is alig tudom leverni, pedig ez 1. szint. Van 10-es nehÃ©zsÃ©gi szint is:)
EgyÃ©bkÃ©nt az 1. kÃ¼ldetÃ©s 3B kÃ¡rtyÃ¡jÃ¡nak a 2 variÃ¡nsa kÃ¶zt hatalmas nehÃ©zsÃ©gbeli kÃ¼lÃ¶nbsÃ©g van! Az egyik vÃ¡ltozat esetÃ©n akÃ¡r 20 kÃ¶rig is eltarthat a jÃ¡tÃ©k akkor is, ha mÃ¡r a 6. kÃ¶rben elÃ©rtem az Ãºt vÃ©gÃ©re... Ha nem jÃ¶n a pÃ³k, nincs mit tenni:(

This is a brilliantly well thought out game. The player is required to think hard about each and every move. Very challenging. Even the easiest mission I've lost on several times. I like challenging. My biggest complaint about the game is that the rulebook had errors in it, and was hard to understand. Although it is very thorough and doesn't leave much left in question. One mistake in the rulebook copy I have is that it tells you to take quest cards 120 to 123 out and use them for your first quest. Well using these quest cards give you mix of two different quests, and made the game doubly hard to learn. Instead you need to use the quest cards all with the same title, and ignore what the rulebook tells you.  Overall, I love this game and it is very worth the money. 

EDIT: I've stopped playing this game after the first 2 months of owning it. There are better games out there and it is easy to get sucked into buying all of the expansion packs which shouldn't have been necessary in the first place. I wish I had never spent alot of money on this game. It was good while I was still figuring it out.

Excellent co-op game.  Solo could use some work, but is still fun.  The lore of the game is fantastic.  The LCG format creates a good format where new content comes out frequently.  Plus, the Cardboard of the Rings podcast adds great fan made content to enjoy.

After some plays: not a bad game at all. A lot of hard strategic choices. I think the strategy maintains the stability of a board game without interference from the collectible aspect of the game. This is a constant development struggle game. Both sides are competing in the development, and the card mechanics offer deep strategies. I dislike the scoring rule that forces you to an early victory though. Apart from that, excellent.

RATING: 8
Lord of the Rings LCG is essentially Magic the Gathering, the cooperative game.
Well, FFG's design team didn't take any chance, and re-used the usual, oiled mechanics you can find in the grandfather of the CCGs. While this is a sound way to design a fine game, one can wonder if they couldn't find anything more original...
Another annoying aspect of the game is the messy lots of FAQs already out there... Indeed, you can't borrow the whole structure from Magic the Gathering, without writing a similarly daunting set of comprehensive rules... or you will end with this mess (to this problem I must add the awful italian translation...)!
BUT, if one can dig its way out through all these drawbacks, the game is quite challenging and enjoyable (as enjoyable a coop could be for me...).
So, I am willing to give it some more tries and find if it can stand my initial rating of 7.

Edit january 14th, 2012: the first plays left me wanting more. The challenges seem so daunting when you have just one core set, I had to buy another. And I feel the urge to try again and again. Rating raised to 7.5.

Edit january 20th, 2012: the game is growing on me and my GF, and we keep playing it, we're definitely hooked. Rating raised again to 8.

Edit february 15th,2012: after nearly 20 plays, it continues asking to be played... Raised to 8.5!

Edit september 8th, 2013: after more than 60 plays, it still is played but with lesser frequency and enthusiasm. Lowered again to 8.

RATING: 8
I fell into the (cunningly set) trap: I had to buy a second core set to find satisfaction as a former CCG player. Now I can build better decks... Is that worth the effort?

Edit january 15th, 2012: short answer to the above question -> YES.

RATING: 9
Loving Lord of the Rings, co-op games and card games I knew it was a game for me :)

I'm a bit disappointed with the limited options of deck-building in the core set - playing with two players forces you to build dual sphere decks so you have to build a 50 card deck from a pool of 60 cards. Sounds like fun? 

It took me 50 games to feel a bit tired of the game but I am sure that each adventure pack will bring a bit of freshness to the game.

RATING: 10
This game fires on all cylinders. Lots of decisions to make with enough randomness to keep it feeling adventurous. A challenging and satisfying experience overall, and tons of variety with the various expansions. I think I would collect this game for the art alone; it's gorgeous and based on the books rather than the movies; it touches on all aspects of Tolkien's world. The deck construction aspect allows you to prepare for your specific quest, and it gives you the feeling of strategizing before adventures much like the journeying company would. This game is a worthy tabletop treatment of Tolkien's masterpiece, and that's saying quite a bit.

Initial Impression: Although FFG has done a great job with production and artwork, my plays of this game so far have fallen kind of flat. I think I need more plays to determine if I'm just missing something. Then again, cooperative games are not my usual cup of tea.

Really enjoying this, I am hooked for expansions for a while.  The co-op will not go over with some in the game group, but the game scales well and plays solo.  Don't be fooled - this plays just fine for 3-4 with only one core set - and I find it a bit shady that FFG is stating otherwise.

Artwork and component quality are top notch, the rulebook is only ok.  There are too many important interactions and timing nuances left out, count on the FAQ to be huge after just a couple expansions.

Update: Rating is dropping, as I'm finding little desire to play this even with new cards coming out.  Expansions so far have been...underwhelming.  Rating has bottomed out, games get more boring and procedural over time and it is obvious FFG didn't test nearly enough - just as I thought, the FAQ and errata are out of control
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great game, but the way the core set is constructed and sold makes entry into the game very difficult.

The mechanics make no sense (You go questing and I'll stay here and kill the monsters!) but the game is engaging and presents many tactical dilemmas.

Great for solo play.

Rating dropped to 7. Because casual play got some much harder and less fun, since decks have to be tailormade to the latest quests. Good general decks didn't work anymore.

[old comment:]
Upped Rating to 10! This new Rating is meant to include the expansions. Without expansions it would be lower. This is now my most played game. It gives you the C/LCG deckbuilding without the need of a competetive play environment. Just meet with your friend(s) once or twice a month and face the new challenge, improve the decks and face it again until you succeed. Pure genius! Add to that the satisfying solo play and you end with an almost perfect game.

Update: Still going strong (first Hobbit box). What's really good is that the game forces you to adapt and alter your decks or build new decks with new quests. And we even imposed some restrictions on ourselves regarding the Hobbit timeline. Looking forward to the next cycle.

Old comment (old rating 8):
Played a PnP version of the final German edition (4 games, 3 2-player, 1 4-player). Only used the one sphere starter decks.

Rating is not final. Will have to test deckbuilding and multi-sphere decks first.

Everyone who likes Arkham, BSG, Death Angel etc. and knows a little bit of CCG/LCG mechanics and likes the Middle-Earth setting should at least try this when it is released.

UPDATE: Played some more games, but still with the starter decks. Quest 1 is really easy, but we got slaughtered by Quest 2. Still have to try deckbuilding. But has been fun so far.

UPDATE 2:
I now regularly meet with a friend to play this. I bring all the cards (2 core sets + all expansions) and we will build decks or alter the decks from the previous session and try to tackle the new scenario or retry a scenario we had failed earlier. We only play once or twice a month and at this frequency my rating remains a solid 8 with upward tendency.

The really great thing about this game is that you can have CCG style deckbuilding without a functioning competetive game group that is required to enjoy most PvP CCGs/LCGs.

A well themed adventure game in the Lord of the Rings setting.  For me its the best solo game I've played.  I come from a MtG background and I love to deckbuild.  I have also been seeking something that feels like a Dungeons & Dragons adventure.

This game takes both of those and melds them together into a cohesive game.  You must deckbuild to defeat scenarios.  I enjoy the deckbuilding aspect.  I also like the adventuring aspect.  Each scenario is unique and provides a different adventuring feel.

May hit 1000 plays at some point.

Currently at the tail end of The Ring-Maker Cycle

Great Game.

This is a wonderful gaming system that works from 1-4 players.  I can also see it working well with one dedicated player who wants to deck build and family/friends more wanting the casual narrative driven play.  Just got 1 game under my belt thus far but really enjoying it.

The advent of easy mode makes me feel that this is now a great game for a broad audience and there is no longer the need to buy lots of expansions to get cards powerful enough (if there ever was) to stand a chance of winning.  With just the base set you can get a very fun game and whilst I would miss the dials if playing 1 set with 3 to 4 players and we might end up low on counters its easy enough to proxy stuff in for them.

I can see me enjoying this both solo and with others.  I do think my enjoyment will be enhanced with a couple of expansions so I have more options for deck building but there is decent amount of deck building that can be done for 1-2 players with the base set with 2 faction decks.

My one non solo play was a bit of a mixed success.  There are a few different types of player for whom this will work but unless you really want an atmospheric ride if you want to get into the strategy this is a game needing repeat plays to shine.

My most played solitaire game and favourite game to immerse myself in. I play almost every weekend, and I'm no way near caught up to the current card releases. The nice bit about this game, is that you don't have to chase a meta like in Netrunner and others, you can go at your own pace. Outstanding art and a fitting tribute to one of my favourite fantasy worlds.

(NB I only log game plays with my girlfriend, so don't pay any attention to that for any solitaire games!)

My buddy just bought like 10 expansions with the base set so we've been playing this a lot. I think I expected like it more, but I'm not sure that the deck building part of the game is really my jam as much as I thought it would be. And it's also really hard! Which is good to some degree but I don't want to be too depressed from losing all the time. Anyway, it's a good game and I hope it grows on me.

RATING: 8.8
First plays and first impressions are good.

Important update:

This game is simply too challenging in solo play.Downgraded it to 8 because winning 2 games out of 21 in solo play is not so much fun. While with 3 players we had a 4/4 win. So not balanced well between number of players.

Scenario 3 can not be won unless you have extreme luck with the cards.

Update after 4 more years playing.

One thing is sure though: the game is addicting. I already played the second scenario 15 times with a mixed single deck Lore/ Leadership. Not even touched other combos. Hard game, but for some odd reason, deck construction and solo experience is addicting.

It could be a new hype: a kind of Magic the gathering card collection/construction system with huge solo possibilities. When constructing and playing, cards come to live and you start caring about some combos and odd heroes. Always a good sign.

Card rule questions are obvious but since it is co op play it is mostly common sense that can resolve 99.9% of all problems.

Great card game, perfect for solo play.  It's somewhat of a merge between MTG (you have to manage ressource points to cast spells) and Legendary (there's a 'villain' AI deck to conquer).
The art is gorgeous!
Beware, this is a typical FFG game : endless expansions to keep up with, lots of keywords to remember, etc.
The difficulty is way up there, but it gets manageable once you get used to how the game works.
Recommended if :
-you like a good soloable deckbuilder that's playable within an hour
-you don't mind having your butt being handed to you

Yeah, I love this. Not going to get all worked up about the LCG model. I will just buy the packs when and if I can and enjoy them. The 3 quests in the base game run from super easy to fairly difficult. But they do serve as a great intro to the mechanics. One thing though, if you really want great decks, you will probably need to get 2 sets, if not for the extra Gandalf cards! I have played through the first 2 "cycles" and have really loved my time doing so. I will get the 3 Hobbit stand alone boxes soon, but before that, Heirs of Numenor is calling...

I had very high hopes for this game. Unfortunately after three plays I'm already fairly certain that this game does not live up to my expectations. It falls into the Fantasy Flight trap of being so convoluted with rules an mechanisms that playing it is more like following a flowchart than actually having fun. The theme that should be the heart and soul of any Lord of the Rings game is just not there. Quest are as generic as they can get and fail to pull you into the game. Combat makes no sense with the seperate defenders and attackers and the relationship between the different parties and allies is murky at best. Travelling along the river I find allies from Gondor, Rohan and the likes who just happen to be there. Really?! Furthermore the game is not really playable out of the box. The prefab decks don't seem to stand a chance against any but the low level quests. This forces you to get more cards and start deckbuilding. For some this may be just what they're looking for. For me it's a big turnoff. The game is but a shadow of what it could have been and a very big disappointment for me.

I just got this in trade recently.  I haven't decided yet how much I enjoy it.  I've played solo on my copy and 2-p with a friend's.  For right now, I'm giving it a seven.

Update:This just isn't my thing.  I don't really enjoy playing and I don't feel the need to try this anymore.  Sold mine at auction.

I enjoyed my first play of this, but I'm not sure it's exactly my style of game.  It reminds me of Mage Knight where I really appreciate the design of the game yet I'm just not sure if the effort is worth the experience.  I'll likely give it at least one more try.

RATING: 7
Good. Usually willing to play.

Reasons for Selling

Great game but:

1. Hard - can invest a significant amount of time just to get walloped.

2. Deck Building - requires a significant investment in time to put together appropriate decks for each quest, to avoid getting walloped.

3. LCG - once you have completed all the quests in the core set then its time for the LCG money sink.

RATING: 4
As with many of the CCG/LCG one against one (here the scenario) games, I find the gameplay dull. I know the challenge lies in the deck-building, but I don't enjoy this aspect usually and the gameplay itself is not for me.

We played a couple of sessions. We beat the first scenario in both. It's a fun game but the FFG has done a terrible job with the components just to get you to buy more cards. By the rules each deck should have no less than 50 cards and the basic game has 30!
Cheap trick -1 in my overall rating.

Best solo game I have.  Much more replayability than Friday or Death Angel.  Love that there are four different decks, and each plays differently.  Multiple quests/challenges as well.  Lots of decisions to be made - money management, card management, pairings for combat, etc.  Very nice game after ten plays.  Watch some of the online videos, much easier to learn that way.  The rule book doesn't explain some of the cards, but that's what the BGG forums are for.  lol.  The base game is fine for me, building custom decks isn't something I've been looking for.

Likes:
- The "engine" of the game is absolutely brilliant, and maybe the most innovative AI engine in a Co-op game today
- The artwork is phenomenal, and it just keeps getting better with each expansion.
- Very good balance of difficulty (Not too easy, not to hard).
- Just pure fun.  Have yet to play this with someone who would not want to play again.

Dislikes:
- The cards seem to come out at maybe to fast of a pace?  I find myself only updating decks maybe once a quarter, and by that time, there has been at least 3 new expansions that have come out.
- Expensive to keep up with

Definitely one of my favourite LCG's.  Works so well.

RATING: 6.75
On first play I wasn't convinced at all - it felt clunky and irritating. but then we realised after a month's downtime that we were playing the decks like individual, discrete decks - as soon as we started really working together the game felt like a really deep challenge.

Now I'm definitely looking forward to the next game - want to see how the other two decks work.

EDIT: After several more plays I am really jonesing to get more of this game in. I love the roleplaying experience provided by the encounter deck and the discrete nature of each adventure - the decision to focus more on adventures rather than deckbuilding in the expansions also makes me really happy.

I still couldn't give two hoots about the theme, but the cards and art look pretty great. Rating improved from 7 to 8.25.

EDIT2: The honeymoon is over, and here's why:

- I have five of the six expansions from this cycle, and have started building decks that fit the 'tournament' rules of 50 cards. I have one Rohan deck that works really well, one mono green deck that is pretty awful, and one dwarf/eagle deck that just doesn't work. I can't get the sixth expansion because everyone's out of it everywhere, and thus can't build a mono red eagle deck. Having no good decks means more than solo with the rohirrim simply doesn't work.

- The problem here is that the card pool is just too small - you only get nine usable cards in each expansion, and one playset is really enough to build maybe two decent decks, at least until the card pool increases substantially.

- the level 4 adventures typically destroy these pathetic decks, so we never play the level 5 or higher ones, mainly because we don't enjoy playing the level 4 ones, so why would we proceed to a MORE difficult one? This means most of the cards I've bought are wasted, because the encounter decks are just too frustrating, and not fun to play.

- I can't get anyone to play this with me. I've now taught six people who just won't play any more. The first four learn on the level 4 Anduin adventure, and found the game frustrating, overly complex and resource-starved. Everyone came out of the first game wanting to 'fix' the game. Never a good sign. The last two I taught on the learning scenario, and they had very similar complaints - too few resources, decks too unreliable.

- All of this stems from the pretty dreadful card pool, and the frankly astonishing requirement that decks should be 50 cards, but the decks from the base game are 30. 30 is a good size for a fun game, 50 just means you have 20 shit cards in each deck.

- the card pool is so stunted that every single deck needs the same five cards, so one playset isn't enough to build enough decks to actually play anyone. FFG really should provide full 50-card decks with a full playset of each card in the base game, so deckbuilders have enough cards to always have four decks, so they can constantly be bringing new players into the game. As it is, the game isn't fun unless you buy far too many cards, and frankly, a game should be its own ambassador, not rely on my wallet to proselytise it.

- The game needs FAR MORE of the basic building blocks of CCGs: more reliable card draw, more resources, and SOME BLOODY COST DISCOUNTERS. You can't have steward of Gondor  and Theodred in every deck, nor should you have to! Some more themed cards to make themed decks work would be appreciated too - like Rohan/Gondor/Silvan/Dwarf specific cost-reducers, or attachment  that allow heroes to spend resources on rohan/gondor/dwarf characters despite resource icons. All the new players of this game that I  have taught agree - being resource starved does not make for an interesting game,it makes for a shit game.

- I'm hoping the Khazad-Dum expansion and the final mirkwood cycle pack will allow me to build a functioning dwarf deck and a functioning eagle mono red deck, so the game will be fun again. If that happens, maybe enough people will enjoy playing it for it to hit the table. At the moment, it's getting passed over pretty often.

- The real shame of this is that the thing that made it get passed over was the purchase of the expansions! It was totally playable out of the box, but deckbuilding is a nightmare, especially when you have to add 20 cards per deck, and there aren't enough cards! That's a terrible strategy - making a game worse with every expansion.

At first, this game wasn't everything I had hoped for. After getting into the expansions, this game opens up a lot. It was either this or the dead Middle-Earth CCG. I'm thinking I made the right choice. No blind buys and much easier to find for decent prices. Plus the cooperative style of play suits this type of theme very well. I recommend picking up a Core Set and the first cycle as a group. If you love Lord of the Rings as much as I do (My daughter's name is Ãowyn) then you will love this game.

The mechanics of this game are brilliant, fun, and cohesive with the theme of the stories.  Although deck construction isn't for everyone, this is probably the best cooperative or solitaire game I've ever played.  The possibilities are nearly limitless for the kind of game you can have with respect to overcoming the evil that comes out of the quest deck.  I usually play it solitaire.

Only played a couple of games now - one solo and one 2 player. The game is very hard to beat but I love how tense it is, the synergies and the beautiful card art. This seems like it's going to be a winner. People complain that there's only 3 scenarios in the base set but I see lots of replay ability in the different decks and then trying to lower your score each time is a draw too. Gonna try to update my rating every so often.
     Edit- 4/28/11 - played four three player games now and I am loving this game. Great fun to have all four spheres in play and we are starting to customize our decks now. Playing the same scenario again and again is not taking away from the replay ability of the game due to the variance of cards drawn from encounter deck and into players hands. Fabulous game!

I particularly like the quick set up and pack down and small table area (solo).

It's a difficult game though. 8-)

I don't currently have the time to pursue this game as a solo. I think I'll attempt to pick it up as a challenge from time-to-time but for now it's upstairs.

I'm missing it though. I think it will get a second life here after getting an extra deck or two.

Despite being _ANOTHER_ card game with lots of cards with lots of text and needing to play it over and over just to see all the game play, this one was kinda fun.  I always dislike that cooperative games end up with EVERY decision being double-checked and scrutinized by EVERY player make it much longer and less fun...  But I think with only 2 players, and a slower onslaught of the bad stuff deck, it would feel like I'm getting more use out of my cards and more interesting decisions would need to be made since not every good faction powers would be present.  I think I would enjoy it more.  I'll definitely try this one again with only 2 players if possible.

I have religiously avoided CCG's and LCG's; the idea of spending loads of money and tweaking a deck for competitive play has just never grabbed me. This title has brought me in because of the cooperative angle. I play it solo (noting, yes, that single deck solo is just not going to be practical for a casual gamer such as myself) and I have a blast. The cards are gorgeous and the scenarios give you little thematic, narrative gifts if you're willing to let your imagination play a bit. I anticipate that there will be frustrating scenarios and less than rewarding adventure pack buys here and there, but, hey, it feels like a big playground in Tolkein land - a terrific opportunity for one who loves the books.

The best game ever. No doubt about it. The rules, the System..it fits all together. To win is often really hard. But to find the right Team of heroes, to choose the best Cards for the adventure you face into your deck...this is so much fun and challenge.
We are now and the Numenor Expansion, so have played already 20 adventures, they are so different, always a new challenge...and never boring. And the System works...solo or with more Players. Thank you so much Designers...your brain work is much appreciated

Great coop. Requires Deckbuilding for full enjoyment. Since shadow effects / encounter cards vary greatly in danger the game sometimes doesn't work too well.

Locationdesign is problematic, since you can remove only 1 per round without additional effects.

I was very much hoping I'd be able to play this out-of-the-box by myself, and after much trial and error and a good deal of online research, I managed to form a deck that pretty consistently beat adventure 1, but 2 was extraordinarily difficult with only one deck... And you can forget about 3!

If you are hoping to play this solo, you WILL need to use two decks and play "for two." 

And call me stubborn, but I'm simply not interested in playing two-handed! :(

And I'm not interested in hunting down specific packs with specific cards just to be able to form a solo "one-handed deck" that I can use.

All that said, the game design itself is lovely and I'm very disappointed that I will probably never find anyone who will "get into" this with me. :(

RATING: 9
Initial rating based on one solo play!

Quite like the art - definitely like the implementation of the theme. Rules are pretty straightforward (and clear). Like the idea of scenarios/quests - although the core game only has limited options, and the co-op (and solo) nature is a nice change from either a "you play hero I'll play Sauron" or 'race for points'.

I like that it's a LCG rather than a CCG, and I like the fact there is deckbuilding.

However all might not be great, first experience was a blow-out, got crushed and I don't think it was poor play on my part. I wonder how much of the game is determined by the random order of the encounter deck, rather than the player decisions (ie. do you play the game, or does it play you).

Need to play it more, and try some expansion packs. Rating likely to change, just not sure in which direction at the moment!

** Update, played it more, both Solo and 2 player, and I'm liking it more, but the 3 scenario limit of the core set seems rather miserly, fortunately there are some great player made scenarios for variety. Rating increased to 8 for now ... [Lore sphere seems to be best in a support role which explains my first game disaster]

*** Update, played some more - and I think 'out of the box' decks are designed for multiplayer play rather than solo, and in that format are fine. I need to investigate deck building, but the current card pool (with one core box) is rather limited! Need another core box (curse you FFG - LCG is a CCG with new clothes ...) 
rating increased, haven't been this gripped by a L(C)CG since MECCG.

I want to like this game a lot more than I actually do. The rules need simplification. Teaching this to my wife lead to our first game together taking 5+ hours with the easiest quest.

Liked this at first but it got a little stale.  Nice art and obviously well designed.  The mechanics are a little abstract (what is questing?) as compared to something like Middle Earth, but then this is a lot simpler and more accessible too.  Playing co-op or solo versus the game just isn't that replayable for me, unless it's a big epic game night type game that's more about the experience, like Arkham Horror.  It's cool that there's so many quests but customizing decks just to beat quests isn't satisfying or enjoyable for me.

However, I think I enjoy Call of Cthulhu a bit more than this one, and I think I am a one LCG kind of guy.

It's super amazing co-op card game, it's our most played game with my wife and my friends. Each new cycle is great and with lot of new mechanics. We have every adventure pack but still there is so many thing we even did not explored in the game. About 200 playthroughts (2015-2017)

I don't like Magic the Gathering but enjoyed this incarnation. Doesn't have the balance issues that I believe dogged the former. Felt challenged by the introduction scenarios which makes me want to attempt the expert or expansion games that I'm sure will provide further challenges and fun. My boys from 16-23 years of age were very engaged.

Own 2 copies of the base set. Sleeved.

RATING: 4
7 plays.  All but one solo.  There's just not much game here, I'm afraid.  It's a puzzle, and falls into many of the traps co-ops often do.  I did not like it well enough to chase the expansions, so off it goes.

I find the single-sphere decks ill-suited to the harder scenarios - they're an exercise in frustration.

I will admit that the first couple of plays were very exciting and I enjoyed them a lot.  But the game quickly lost interest.  I reckon that new exciting feeling would be recaptured somewhat with each expansion, but I'm not chasing them.

I like a game that kicks my a**. And this one does. Over and over and over. Some scenarios through expansion are less interesting than others. For instance, I find the Hunt for Gollum fairly boring. Some scenarios are easy to build a strategy to defeat with ease. However, many many scenarios just beat us down consistently. I like the challenge. I like the flexibility of the custom built decks (without that annoying "rare" crazy money phenomenon of true CCGs).

Have yet to be grabbed by the theme here. The mechanics are good but seem to be at the forefront. Hopefully it will improve as I play more.

RATING: 7.8
A very interesting game with lots of variation.  I really need to play more to judge properly.  I like it after two games.

The sheer quantity of sequences in each turn is a little convoluted at this stage - hopefully as my familiarity with the game system improves, this will sort itself out.

Third game in, and the sequence is starting to sort itself out.  I am really enjoying the challenge of dealing with the different card combinations to make best use of characters attachments and effects - seems like a really solid game.  If this level of play holds out for a couple of games I could see myself bumping up the rating.

RATING: 8
Awesome card game. Solitaire or co-op. Spent countless hours building and testing decks and enjoying the games immensely rich theme. 

------
My rating of the game has decreased slightly - possibly due to burnout (I have hundreds and hundreds of unlogged plays). However, since returning to university I've been unable to keep up with all the expansions financially, and I've realised just how much of my enjoyment of the game was in pursuing these expansions and the new challenges they offer. However, my unlogged play count are a testament to the game's replayability, particularly whilst you are still working out your "style" of play when first getting into the game.

The deck building can be a bit overwhelming at times (even with just the core set!). Even though I was using many of the cards and ideas presented in this thread http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1108855/back-basics-killer-deck-using-only-cards-single-co the game was still largely a disaster for me. After digging the game back out (I wanted to like it!) I used the deck and heroes as presented in the above thread and after a rocky start have had some success at the game. I still have trouble managing cases where I get no low cost allies in the initial card draw or when I get many low threat enemies at the start of the game. Overall I am starting to see how cards interact with each other and am starting to enjoy the game more. I am on to Journey Down the Anduin next. Changed rating from 7 to 7.5.

It is not the theme-loaded holy grail of Co-Op that some are praising it. Themewise I would put it in the same category as Lords of Waterdeep, since both have their theme just in pictures and little sentences.
But...
I do love this game. It has nice gameplay without the lots of rules I was expecting.
Well, there aren't that many scenarios included but, hey, FFG has to make money somehow.
By now I was a bit deterred by the LCG-system but this game might change that.
This will definetly go into my collection sooner or later...more sooner than later...ok, I'll order it now.

A few days and a few expansions later this game went through the roof. I have to admit the LCG hook got me. But it is great. This game doesn't even get packed away currently. The box is always on the table, open, waiting for a quick round or two.

After over 30 plays I have to say that this game is a trap. Once you play the base game you think "Yeah, that's cool. This will last a while since I can restructure my deck." Yeah, no! You are through the scenarios and hunger for more instantly. More cards, more adventures...
Hopefully this will cease some day. Before the 24â¬ basegame turns into a 200â¬ set.

After some more scenarios the theme pops up. The three from the base game are just "meh" but later quests really bring the theme with them. A race feels like a race, an overwhelming fight against dozens of enemies feels exactly like that.

Ahora mismo he empezado a jugar y estoy muy HYPEADO pero para jugar en solitario (manejando uno o dos mazos) me parece entretenido e interesante. El punto narrativo me gusta bastante y la dificultad por ahora correcta aunque aÃºn no he empezado con la misiÃ³n dÃ­ficil de la caja bÃ¡sica. Me gusta el tema de hacer los mazos, elegir las cartas para cada misiÃ³n (cambian de una a otra), y jugarlos con distintas esferas. Creo que por lo menos el primero ciclo me lo voy a comprar y ya verÃ© hasta donde llegue (lo mismo hasta me hago completista aunque sea caro el asunto).

Los nuevos retos que van aÃ±adiendo las aventuras (por ahora el completado el ciclo de Sombras del Bosque Negro) van cambiando, ampliando y mejorando el juego ademÃ¡s el disponer de mÃ¡s cartas le da mucho mÃ¡s interes a la tarea de hacer mazos.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent cooperative card game, almost worth the extravagant cost of all those chapter packs. The gameplay is both streamlined and challenging, and the artwork is by far the best of any game I own or have seen. Each time I play I think about what cards are working well for me and which ones I want to change out in a future deck. The multiple scenarios, different spheres, and varied heroes give this game an unbelievable amount of replay value, especially with the solo option. 

UPDATE: Still a favorite of ours, two dozen plays in. The Saga expansions are amazing (and very thematic) and I am continually surprised by the variety and ingenuity of the quest designs. Eat your heart out, Arkham Horror LCG, this one still has you beat.

Interesting so far.  I'll be playing around with this more and graduating to making my own decks.  Update: I really want to like the game, but they just screwed you with the core set.  Also, this thing was not thoroughly play tested for fun, there are some situations (2 goblin snipers for example) that needed to be dealt with in testing and weren't.  Makes me really unsure about future cards.

RATING: 6
It's fun when the cards come out fairly well mixed, but clusters of similar cards can be brutal - to the point of ruining the game.  In one solo game three location cards came out in a row which effectively removed any chance of winning the game.  Even with committing all characters to questing there wasn't enough willpower to overcome the threat, which meant no progress was ever made on the locations, so the threat never decreased.  Game over.  Not a satisfying way to lose the game.

Random "screwage" situations like that dampen my enthusiasm for the game.  Plus there are numerous rules questions about timing and card wording that make the game feel unpolished.  I'm sure many of these will be addressed in a FAQ at some point, but right now the game is kind of "meh" for me.

This game allows for no unique and different ways to approach a situation. You either have the cards a situation needs, or you lose. In this (not so subtle) way the game forces you to buy the booster packs in wich you find the cards you need to skip the situation. 

All boosters also contain new scenario's wich might sound like a good thing, but all it does in the end, is fill up 75% of the booster pack you just bought with a new scenario, when you desperately need characters etc to beat the current scenarios you already own. This could be solved by selling them separately, but then they would make less of a profit because the scenario's would most likely not sell as good as the other packs....

Buying this game gave me the feeling like i was being conned out of my money, wich is very rare when dealing with FFG, a company i hold in high regards.

I wasn't sure how a ccg co-op would play but it seems to work well, as well as being different from other co-ops I've played - no mean achievement.

While there's a fair amount of rules, they are in large print with lots of pictures and examples so aren't as intimidating as they might appear - it took us about 10 minutes to get into the swing of things (the only problem we had was remembering to draw shadow cards at the right point).  Despite comments elsewhere about how tough the game is we sucessfully completed the first two scenarios without losing a single hero - maybe it helped that there were three of us?

Looking forward to playing more.

Well, after a bit more play, I think Lord of the Rings LCG is an OK game that just doesn't do it for me. It's too mechanically overwrought (resulting in easily missed rules), and thematically vacuous. The Dwarves are a prime offender; they get really strong powers when they suffering  multiple wounds, but how many times is anybody wounded at all in The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, never mind twice or more? Again, MECCG got this right, LotR LCG did not. And the quests ae so generic they completely fail to engage. The packaging here is also really problematic. They've gone with a mix of OK, powerful, and insanely powerful cards in the game, so a key to playing well is having the capability to dig through your deck for the key cards. But in deck-building, those key cards are the ones they've given you only one or two copies of, so when you bloat your deck to 50 cards (as requiured by the current deck rules) deck-digging has even more of a premium. So anyway. Again, this all sounds harsh, and LotR LCG isn't that bad. But it's mid-90s game design and except for the production design, it feels the decade out of date that it is.
---
Hmm. Played Scenario 2 three times: once solitaire, once with two players with fixed complimentary decks, once with two players with constructed decks. Each time, we got completely slaughtered while managing to get no more than 3 progress tokens on the first stage. There seem to be a lot of "you lose" card combos in the shadow deck (like a second Cave Troll, the nasty Brown Land location if you've already travelled to a location, and just a lot of locations). None of the games has been at all fun. The hope I hold out for the game is rapidly diminishing.
---
Initial rating based on some solitaire play and giving the game the benefit of some doubt (which it may or may not deserve). Some interesting cooperative levers to pull, and the theme is reasonably well-done. Nice art. Some reasonably well-integrated randomness, which previous FFG LCGs have suffered the lack of. Far closer in flavor to the "ride on a rails" Decipher CCG than the much richer Middle Earth: The Wizards. Fans of MECCG should make sure not to expect too much here. It's FFG after all and somewhat mechanical. FFG in-house designs are mostly blender jobs, with mechanisms pieced together from other games and maybe a few extra blunt force design ideas, and LotR:tCG isn't much different. But, it does seem like it'll be a lot better than the Decipher game was.

Out-of-the-box playability, especially solitaire, is somewhat questionable. First quest is a cake walk, second quest I think several of the pre-made decks are going to get immediately clobbered. You need either more players or to do some deck-building. The combat-heavy deck (Legolas & Gimli) can be especially hosed, while Eowyn can fairly easily keep threat low and rack up quest progress. It is an LCG, so what do you expect I suppose, but good, playable "fixed decks" are a feature of good CCGs which is noticeably absent here.

It's also slightly depressing to think that 15+ years on, none of FFG's LCGs have really evolved that much further than Magic: The Gathering - the design roots of instants, permanents, creatures, combat, tapping, and mana-like power are all still clearly identifiable in Lord of the Rings: The Card Game. As tools go they aren't bad, but this is a problem that could have used some imagination - see: Nightfall.

Anyway, that's a lot of negativity, but my overall impression is that the cooperative angle will work in interesting ways, and that while the design itself isn't more than workmanlike, it may be good enough. We'll see.

I'm just not a fan of CCG's, and this is a little too close for my tastes.  It was still somewhat fun to play as a team game, as other players are much better at keeping track of everything that needs to be tracked than I am.  I've just never been a fan of most games that have cards with all kinds of symbols, special abilities, etc to keep track of, and while this one was tolerable in that regard, it still isn't that exciting to me.

I can also imagine this would be great for those that like to deck-build, trying to find an optimal deck for each mission.  I had fun enough just playing with standard decks, but can definitely see the appeal for those that are into it.

So, in the end, my rating doesn't mean the game blows.  It's just not my style.

Awsome game. The scaling of it can be a bit hit and miss with a 2 player game seeming way too hard with some scenario's. Loved the idea of co-op though as I'm not that competetive sometimes and don't like board games card games were you are trying to kill the other players especially if more than 2 players are playing. I've been killed first and have to sit for an hour while the game finishes far to many times to find games like that enjoyable. This one means you are working together as a group and helping one another. I like that idea.

I greatly dislike the Lord of the Rings IP. The books are filled with racism, sexism, and classism; and those are the heroes in a moral absolutist tale. Couple that with a writing style I found long and tedious, and there is absolutely nothing I enjoyed about them.

The game doesn't change much of that, although it does treat women much better than the original IP does, giving them more presence (as in there are far more of them in the game), full roles as opposed to supporting roles, and where they are just as heroic as the male characters.

Component-wise the game is short the number of cards required to do any deck-building (which, one might argue, is a key attraction of the xcg format).

And yet, I rate the game positively, because for all it's flaws it does have some solid positives.

It is a great co-op game. I found the solo game, since you don't have enough cards to do deck-building, a waste of time. However, the co-op game really drives home the cooperation through play as while decks are solid on their own, two decks playing side by side are more than the sum of their parts. When cards from different spheres are combined interesting and powerful effects can occur (think 1 + 1 = 3 instead of 2).

It's a co-op game where clear individuals work towards a common goal, but not always together. By which I mean that it's a co-op game with individuals as opposed to just one hive mind (which I've realised is essential for me to enjoy co-ops). This is seen in that battles are almost always solo, and that different spheres have different strengths and so work towards the same goals but often in their own way.

One needs to enjoy building decks before play in order to get the most from the game, mind. You have to have the time (and a play partner who has the time as well) to get to know the cards and build decks before play (lonely fun). If you don't enjoy that process, the game will quickly become unenjoyable.

Based off one solo play. Extremely punishing and that was only on the first (easy) L3 scenario. I can only imagine the other two scenario which is meant to be L7 and L9 difficulty. But I do like my co-operative games with the odds stacked against the players.

The mechanics of the game work really well though and the dual use of the encounter cards.

Further play with more players and expansions should up the score eventually.

My first (real) venture into LCG games. Love this game and the adventure packs that go with it. To stop the collector urge I force myself to play every scenario at least 2 times before buying another expansion pack. Can also be played solo which is a plus for me.

RATING: 8
Firstly: Not a casual pick up and play game. This game requires a lot of learning and deep understanding, and can be very, very frustrating.

Secondly: The main part of this game is making a deck for each quest. It's not really feasible to keep using the same deck for each quest. You should like deck-tinkering if you want to get into this game.

I really love the theme and presentation of the game and the cards. However I am struggling to enjoy the game as it is so punishing.

Rating at 7.5 for now - may update score later.

This game gets better with more play. There are lots of cards that can interchange so the replay is great. I think this game shines with its solo and cooperative play, it really feels as if I am trying to make it through the quests, and it's really cool working together with someone. The card play is also very cool and makes a big impact on the game. I am not big on the deck building aspect of the game, I'd rather be playing.

http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: Great story and sense of anticipation as I wait to see what the quest has to throw at me. Also the deckbuilding provides a great deal of variation and I am always hoping my next card will help me. Gandalf, please?  Of course it being fantasy helps me like it even more.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.  So many choices. Who should I commit to questing? Combat? Should I use this item on my heroes? Use it now? Later? When should I use this event card? So many tough decisions all the way to the end. 

3) Player interaction: Of course there is no interaction in the solo game, however with two players your playing together is vital for you to survive and beat the game. Teamwork is a vital part of this game.

4) Components/artwork Top notch artwork! I mean seriously this game looks amazing! Very fun game. 

5) Game length/complexity: perfect game length. I can knock out a couple of solo games in an hour and One 2 player game in an hour as well.

Bottom line: fun game that i do enjoy, but for some reason i just dont often want to play it.

Mixed feelings about this. I am a huge LOTR fan and this game speaks to me. However, it's hard to find other people interested in it. Also, some unlucky card draws early on can really have a very negative impact on your enjoyment throughout the game. 

Despite this, it was quite fun and deserving of a lot of play time. I'll probably amend my review after playing this 10-20 more times, but at the moment it will hit the table quite often.

Another good FFG LCG product. I wasn't going to touch this until I learned that it was both co-operative and capable of solo play. Thumbs up.

Despite that, the game really is focused on at least two players. Solo play, even on the simple intro scenario, is incredibly tough and some scenarios, especially in later packs, are almost impossible to play solo.

Played scenarios 1 and 2 with a friend. Scenario 1 was easy with someone else to draw the beasties away and focus on game progression. Scenario 2 killed us before we could even put a progress marker down. 

I think this is a great product and it can only get better.

ah...Love this game! It is a bit of a money sink, but it is beautiful. I used to be a CCG guy with Magic; this really scratches that itch, while keeping my wallet less empty (kind of? expansions every month is a little heavy). This game is hard! There are some decks that are obviously better than others, but I use it as a difficulty system. I have made a really good deck that can beat pretty much every scenario. Well, I love deck building, so my goal is to design a deck that makes each scenario challenging. If you don't like deck building, this game won't be quite as fun, but it will still give you a good time.

I grew up playing card games like Yugioh, Pokemon and Magic. LCGs are by far WAY better than any of those. This LCG is great because it's co-op and can also be played solo. I also really love customizing my deck for this game like I did with the card games I grew up with. This game will eat your wallet if you try to collect it all, but at least it won't devour your arms and legs too like the card games I grew up with....

A good game and an especially interesting Living Card Game experience, but I think it lacks something to help make the scenarios/quests feel more varying - I was actually hoping for something a little more adventurous than this. As it stands now I'm not too keen on replaying any of the quests because they're kind of repetetive, even though each of the four Hero decks (if you could call them that) do feel very distinctive and varying in how they play - offering a much better, newer experience than the actual quests.

RATING: 5
While the card art and overall gloss of this game is very well done, in my initial look at this game I have to say that it just feels unpolished in comparison to the later AH: LCG in terms of narrative treatment, but is probably the better of the two in terms of solo play.

In essence players each pick a set of 1-3 heroes who come from one of several classes of cards. Each turn those heroes generate resource tokens of their class that are used to play cards from your hand that will either increase the size of your team with allies, give the team weapons, or otherwise pull off positive events.

The game is played primarily against the story deck and an accompanying deck of encounter cards that are randomly drawn each turn. Players ultimately want to exhaust their team to make progress on the quest using one of their stats, but the encounter decks continuously spits out enemies and locations that will make it harder and harder to make progress unless they are dealt with first, and doing this also will exhaust your team for the round; this is the juggling act of the game.

Though the game plays pretty smoothly once you get going with it the difficulty seems very dependent on how the encounter decks flips out, as it is very easy for it to be generous or very nasty depending on how fast the high threat cards come out, as those are what create speed bumps for the team.

I'm not crazy about the abstracted nature of the movement on this relative to Arkham Horror: LCG, and I also think the theme is significantly worse than Arkham mostly because of that lack of board play (locations have a much richer theme in Arkham whereas here they are just abstracted in terms of how you visit them) and because there is only a single deck in this to provide a theme gloss whereas Arkham has 2 and an accompanying narrative campaign to pull the thing together. LotR does seem like it is more of a gamer's type game in the sense of min-maxing and deck-building, but its thematic immersion is much lower for me.

On the plus side, if you're into it, solo play seems much more reasonable here though, as there don't seem to be as many ways for the players to really help each other out effectively here and the nature of the team you build for your own deck means you can easily build a diverse solo deck to tackle whatever the scenario might want to throw at you. I wouldn't object strenuously to playing this is someone had decks and wanted to, but I doubt I will really dive into it as I don't do a lot of solo gaming and I don't see my gf playing this one in lieu of Arkham as the continuous deck-building would be a bug and not a feature for her. In other words: textbook 5 and I doubt it'll get back to the table.

I've played through the first scenario with 3 and 4 players which seemed a bit easy. I think the game has potential but I'm not sure it's really ready out of the box without an extra base set or the add on packs. The process of having one hero block a creature and then needing another to actually attack and damage it is a big rules disconnect for me. But I look forward to trying a more challenging scenario to see if it is a worthy co-op game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Update: I have played the game a lot (by my standards). Usually solo with two-player rules, i.e. two decks. However, I do not think that the game deserves a higher rating than 7: all the problems that I described in the initial comment  - thin theme, poor scaling, poor scenario design, imbalance in usefulness of player cards, opaque rules - are clearly there. The number of plays reflects the fact that an individual game can be very short. However, I have to admit that with several expansions the game is sufficiently diverse and customizable to keep my attention. (Of course, it also means that I have spent far too much - expansions are overpriced.)

------
Update: I changed the rating from 6 to 7. The game is markedly better with 2 or 3 players, although it may be a bit too easy for 3 players. More interesting combos can be pulled off. The decks are sufficiently diverse that each player can contribute in a distinct way. Most importantly, the game feels like a coop instead of a solo puzzle where you have to negotiate with other players to be able to do what you want to do. There is enough hidden information that the more experienced player cannot dominate easily. 

---------
 
The game looks gorgeous, has opaque rules and glaring gameplay issues. In other words, it is a typical FFG game. The game has the potential to be superb, however, the potential is not realized in the core set and the chances that the expansions will change this are virtually zero because the problems are too fundamental. 

The game looks like most other FFG games, that is, it looks great (rating +2). It plays quick (rating +1). I also happen to like the Middle Earth theme (rating +1). Unfortunately, the theme is not well implemented and is rather thin (rating -1). So, Eowyn the princess of Rohan and Denethor the Steward of Gondor have started new career as messengers for the King Thranduir?!! Moreover, most of the time you do not feel like exploring Middle. The biggest immersion killer is the fact that locations exist in multiples. Unfortunately, the game has more serious issues than poorly implemented theme. Firstly, the pacing is wrong (rating -2). The quests are brutally difficult in the beginning: you must have luck in drawing cards and you have to take great risks or the game is over. However, once you have managed to get a decent number of cards on the table it often gets too easy. Secondly, the players' cards are very unequal in power (rating -1). Some cards are so good as to be nearly broken (e.g. Steward of Gondor, Northern Tracker) while other cards have very limited use (e.g. Rain of Arrows). Thirdly, the game does not scale properly (rating -1). It is much more difficult solo than with two players and I suspect that it is too easy with four players. Also, you can theoretically play with 1-3 heroes per player but you want three in practice - you very much need the extra starting power and additional resources. (I started my first âEscape from Dol Guldur" quest solo with one hero. That was a really quick game! No further comments - I do not want to spoil it for you - try it yourself. ;) ) In short, the game is not great but there is some entertainment in it.

The best cooperative game I have ever played. It is actually really easy to teach as there are only 7 Phases. The fact that the game is cooperative makes it so in 1 round new players learn the game. Also, the artwork, writing, and the LOTR setting makes it easy for players to RP the events in which are occurring during a game. My favorite part about this game is that I can play it solo. It is the best single-player game I have ever played.

We desperately need more plays of this one. We played it a ton when we first got it and quickly realized we needed a lot more time and thought put into learning how to properly deck build. It is on our list of games to spend more time with and we have some quick guides for getting us started in learning how to get the most out of the game. Once we get going, I expect we will really enjoy this one for quite some time.

If viewed as a thematic game, this game fails on a number of counts. The whole game feels like it's in the wrong order, the best days for the fellowship were at the start and the darkest days were at the end, in this, you often have to hold on for dear life in the first few turns but coast across the finish line. Fortunately I'm a Eurogamer, so can forgive many sins in the pursuit of a good game. The gameplay is addictive and I love the teamwork in the LCG format. I think that the game would possibly work better with a different theme, but it does make it very accessible.

Lord of the Rings LCG: 3 cores, All Shadows of Mirkwood, 3 Khazud-dum, All Dwarrowdelf, Over Hill and Under Hill, Massing at Osgiliath. I have 3 copies of every player card sleeved in FFG clear sleeves (at least $50 worth). I also have all gotten enough quest cards so that I don't have to rebuild each quest when I want to play for everything except Over Hill and Underhill. All of those cards are sleeved too. The only exception is a few proxied cards in Shadow and Flame. One of each rulebook has been taken apart and put in sheet protector in a binder along with expansion sheets, and FAQ's. I have an entire set of tokens and dials unpunched along with 2 sets that are. The cards are stored in 2 Really Useful Boxes. I can send pictures if you want.

2 core sets. I've pre built 3 decks for cooperative or solo play. I no longer have the box insert, but the game would come with deck boxes for the encounter cards as well as the player decks. There are also plenty of cards for further list building. I'd also toss in the plano that I got and a bunch of colored glass beads to track the different types of resources (same color on the art of the cards)

I don't rate many games a 10 - and I NEVER thought I would give a 10 to a collectible card game.  I was a Magic collector/player when it was new and fresh, but after I burned out on the never-ending Magic franchise, have not returned to CCG's since.  I have little patience for deck building and hate the normal pay-for-power CCG structure, so the LCG concept is the only way I could have returned to deck-building card games - bravo FFG!  That being said, this game is AWESOME!! Great solo and team play, theme perfection true to the Tolkien stories and world.  Truly brilliant how each Quest is a mini-story, with its own unique rules, special events and cards that create a very thematic and diverse library of ways to play this game that revolve around the core mechanic and cards used to construct decks that adapt to each unique challenge.  And the game just keeps getting better and better as they explore more of the Tolkien world, adapting the books directly into the game as saga expansions that allow you to play the characters from the stories, completing the very same quests out of the books.  This is the BEST deck-building CCG style card game I have experienced and I look forward to each new quest as if it is the release of a new adventure to experience.

This game is amazing!
After 10 games, at least winning one time with each of the pre-made decks I am hooked. Now I am making tournament decks with at least 50 cards. Creating decks with 2 spheres to see how they interact together. Great game. Great for solo play.

Addition: The advantage to playing 4 players vs 1. You have 12 heroes with special abilities instead of 3. Huge advantage in my opinion.

Addition: Seriously can not play this enough. The scenarios are varied and the play is fun and challenging.

EASY MODE: -Add one Resource to each Hero's Resource Pool. -Remove all Encounter Cards with the Difficulty Indicator (gold band.)
TIME x: Remove one Time Counter at the end of the Refresh Phase.

RATING: 9
Pretty amazing game.  I've only played solitaire, and every time it has been a cinematic experience.  Somehow, the quest cards and game mechanics make it quite easy to imagine the story/scenario you're playing out with these cards.  It really does feel like an adventure.  And some of the quests are absolutely infuriatingly difficult.  I've pounded the table more than once after an hour investment only to barely lose in the end.  Building the right deck becomes important fairly quickly in the scenarios, and it can be fun to try out the nearly infinite possibilities.  On the other hand, losing a lot can turn some people off, especially those of us with jobs and families who can't make this our life aim.  Still, one of my most prized games, especially when I want to play a game by myself.

I think I am too stupid for this game â¦ but I like it nonetheless.

Have won the first scenario twice so far. I *think* I start 'getting' it. Very intriguing.

(solo only, my wife tried it once but I think she didn't like it as much)

While the illustrations are really gorgeous, I don't think the theme is too strong in this game. It feels nothing like LotR, mostly because it's incongruent with the novels (questing with Denethor e.g.) and because it feels so mechanical. I can't imagine trash-talking this game up. But I like it as a solo exercise.

My favorite game! Tough, beautiful, deep!
Great artwork, amazing immersion.
Even the stories that doesn't exist on 'real' Tolkien narrative are very detailed, the stories of the books are included at the Saga Expansions. The mechanics works very well.
Most of my plays is solo, but multiplayer works very good.
I like very much to build decks, but if you doesn't, keep away from this game.

Quite addictive. Very thematic. Deck building makes it really fun. Endless replayability with so many cards available. The best solo game. Downside: 1) rules are fiddly and need to consult to FAQ all the time, 2) a lot of luck involved, 3) no mobile deck building app. Despite the many flaws, still a 10/10 game. Caters to my likings of RPGs and PES. Comparing to ANR, not as streamlined, but can play solo.

This game was huge this last summer (2011) at least for me. I was playing this game all the time. Now it seems that people have little interest. I love that this game scratches my deck building itch. I have built some killer decks and with several people we can win almost every time. But it does seem a little one sided. I mean once my decks get going there is no stopping us. Also, it is a lot to teach. And I think people, at least people in my group of friends, shy away from deck building games--even though this is a living card game rather than a collectible card game. I would like to play it more often, it just doesn't seem to happen. I even purchased several of the expansions, but have stopped as I am not playing the game barely at all anymore.

Not a bad little card game.  There is enough theme to keep a game interesting and the adventures have a nice, unique feel to them.  The questing and combatting are well designed systems leading you to make some interesting tactical and strategic decisions.  The game truly excels multi-player; the sentinel and ranged cards add a lot of flavor and fun with a partner than they do solo.  I will be buying some adventure packs to add to an already excellent game.  Great job, FFG!

RATING: 6
Components: Gorgeous art, graphic design. Good iconography. Like most games in this genre, the text on the cards is way too small. Flavor text is cool, but I would gladly lose it to double the font size of the text that matters. I can imagine this will only get worse as I get older.

Experience: Jury is still out. Like Lord of the Rings and The Lord of the Rings TCG, questing through regions is fun, and brings with it an impending sense of doom. At times we felt so close, but then the forces of evil mounted, and eventually suffocated us.

Whereas the TCG brought the idea of Twilight as currency, exertion (wounding oneself for an effect), and each player playing as both the freepeoples and minions, this game introduces the staging area, and how its threat level slows down our progress, giving the sense of a dungeon level that we must clear before we can proceed. That's a fun mechanism. Not much else is new here, as most of the other mechanisms just flow naturally from the source material.

The rules seemed mostly straight forward, but in execution they were more fiddly than I had anticipated. We had to constantly step through the phase sequence in the back of the rules, not only to determine which step was next, but especially to know when we could play actions or not. There's a lot of terminology to learn. In the base set, the keywords don't seem to serve much purpose, and various complexities in the rules (e.g., behavior of unique cards) are mostly not applicable. Through repeated play, this problem would go away.

We felt like we were winning a war of attrition against Ungoliant's Spawn, but then a nasty Shadow effect all but wiped my party. From that moment on, we were certain of defeat, yet still had to play out three depressing rounds (a la Risk) waiting for the game to end, which wasn't much fun. In the TCG, Frodo could often find a way to escape such odds and make it to Mt. Doom. But in this game, where the only thing that matters was Attack Strength vs. the spawn's Defense Strength, there was no hope in sight.

If you love Tolkien's work, do yourself a favor and get this game.  The artwork and flavor of the game just exudes Middle-Earth, and it is truly a delight to play.  The core mechanics are pretty easy to pick up, and yet the depth of the game is staggering, with all the card combinations/strategies you can employ.  And the best thing is, it is challenging!  It wouldn't be fun if winning was easy, right?!  Just like Frodo's journey was no walk in the park, completing scenarios in this game really give you a sense of accomplishment, given the many perils you'll encounter and have to overcome.  Did I mention the card art was out of this world?!

Now I own the game & have played it with 4,2 & solo. Also the first cycle is complete & I'm getting a feel for the direction of story & the scope of the game it is obviously getting more detailed & interesting. I like the range of the adventures even if the play is very different from one to the next. Upped the rating to 8. 

First play was pleasant enough. A lot easier to learn than MECCG but then it has a lot further to go to achieving the depth of that game.

 First few games are more about endless âthere and back againâ listing in rules (so much stuff to be aware of and lots of texts on cards can be interpreted in more than just one way) and because of difficulty âWaiting for Godot, ehm... Gandalfâ than actual pleasure of playing it, but after this martyrium there is sweet price indeed.

 The breaking point for me was moment when I started evaluate
all rules, mechanics and steps fully automaticly. In that moment I start thinking about it more as a story than just âuse this card and do that to gain +1 of thatâ. Quality of this game will not be determine by expansions, because it is already very good as it is now. But yes, future possibilities are countless and this game can be with us for very long time. 

 And note that this is very tough game (or not game, but quests), but in good challenging way which is fun to try with different approach, combination etc. 

 As solitaire experience: 7/10 and as cooperative experience: 8/10

6 might be too low, but the description is about right.  Mainly, my beef is with it being a co-op.  I want to build a deck so I can try to beat my buddy with it, and so we can talk about how cool each other's combos and stuff were afterward.  Isn't this sort of like an arms race where only one side shows up?  The challenge deck doesn't design new combos or react to what I'm making.  Nor can it appreciate a clever play or deck theme.

I love Lord of the Rings.  I like designing decks.  I want to love this game, but I'm just not sure the co-op concept makes any sense to me.  OK, true, some people might also feel it was weird to have (say) an Elf Deck battling against an Ent deck or Ranger deck or something, but we're sort of used that by now aren't we?

Plays well with 2-3 players, imo.  I like the player abilities, as they are done with attachments and events.  It is definitely a tough one to win.  It would be nice if the decks were a little more balanced.  It's cool that they are themed to be specialized, but I don't care to mix decks to get a balance.  I would rather just be able to grab another deck for a bit of variety.  Still need some more plays to make a final judgement.

Played one, two and three players. Very clever cooperative game with a heavy Tolkien theme that seems to come alive for me.  Much more going on than in most coops and requires heavy cooperation to win, while eliminating the "I'll play for both of us" problem many have. I'm constantly amazed at the game mechanisms that create a story while you play, and am looking forward to playing more. 

Update: the mechanistic nature of the game as well as various timing issues get in the way of the story, which I'm finding a bit frustrating. Still enjoy playing but I'm hoping the scenarios get better as we get deeper into the game. I've heard they do, so fingers crossed.

Update again: Iâm finding the Arkham Horror LCG to be fantastic and havenât played LotR since Arkham came out. Still plan to get back to it eventually.

(My comments based on Solo play)
I've heard lots of positives regarding this game, but I have to admit: I just didn't *get* it.

Positives: It is wonderfully strategic. It is great that you can customise the cards used within the game in order to best tackle the scenario. 
Definitely less daunting to new players if you separate all the cards into their respective decks. You can safely return 75% to the box as they won't be used in the starting scenario.

Personally: This was my first deckbuilding game. Sadly, I suspect it has revealed that deckbuilders aren't for me. The thrill of deciding which cards to include in your hand just wasn't there.

I owned this game a while before I actually figured out how to play correctly (the first few times were attempts before I had more experience as a board gamer), this has been the most difficult game I have ever had to learn up to this point in my life.  The amount of cards in the core set isn't overwhelming, but the rulebook is pretty lengthy, and I feel it doesn't easily summarize all the little details and questions that would come up when trying to play for the first few times.  I'm not sure how it could have been written better, but I just feel like that was part of the reason I initially gave up.  I would play, and have a question, and spend five minutes searching the rulebook for the answer.  Sometimes I found the answer, and sometimes I wouldn't so I would just guess what to do so I could try to keep playing.  To anyone trying this game for the first time, I would highly recommend watching the "Watch it played" series on how to play, it helped me immensely.  My final score is based on both how much fun I've had playing, and how frustrating it was to learn.  I would score it a little higher, but I can't ignore how difficult it was to finally get to enjoy.

When the game first came out, I looked into it, but passed it over based on reviews and the FFG video.  A couple of years later, after getting into Netrunner (my first LCG), I decided to check out some of the other LCGs to see if they were just as awesome.  I was drawn to LOTR because I can play it solo.

I picked up two core sets, because I wanted to have at least two decks put together without swapping cards around.  I really liked the gameplay.  It feels like a puzzle that I have to solve, but the theme really comes out in the quest cards.  Through the game mechanics, it feels like there is a troll guarding the raft.  Then I'm on the raft floating down the river, while hordes of enemies gather along the banks chasing after me, peppering me with arrows.  Eventually, I'll get off the raft and have to battle all of the baddies that kept up with me.

I've acquired the other cards, but haven't really played around with them yet.  At first I looked to the internet for decks, now I am starting to build my own.  I have also started playing solo with two decks.  I find it very interesting to try and build two different decks that compliment one another.  Unlike other games of this ilk, where sometimes I have taken apart decks without ever playing them in order to build new ones, I can get instant feedback by playing the game solo at home.  I don't have to wait until I can manage to get out and find someone else to play against.  I was was going to be stranded all alone on a desert island, I think this might be the game I'd want with me.

This game immediately became my wife's most-requested game. In 9 months, we have played more than 100 games, outpacing Pandemic by a mile. We love it. The quest-to-quest variations in mechanics and win conditions is what makes this game, and requires us to re-build our decks with good frequency. It also makes for some very thematic moments. The only thing that keeps this from getting a 10-rating is the cost. The base game comes with 3 scenarios. So in order to get that replay value, you've got to keep spending money. Lots of money.

RATING: 10
Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is my all time favorite game. Here is my top five list of reasons why:

5. The Lord of the Rings theme. I admit it. I am a sucker for Tolkien. In my youth, I read the trilogy every year and it is still my favorite book. But more than that, the adventure based game transports me to Middle Earth. I really feel like I am in control of Aragorn, Gandalf, or Frodo because the theme is so powerfully meshed with gameplay.

4. Great artwork. The card art is original and beautiful. It is new LotR art that somehow feels as though it always existed in Middle Earth canon. Great art helps players immerse themselves in the theme. 

3. Replayability. Playing against the same adventure with the same deck over and over again is possible because of the randomness inherent to drawing cards. You can play against the same adventure seeing new cards each time. Or you can build your deck specifically to defeat the adventure, tweaking it by a card or two each iteration until it is a finely tuned adventure winner. 

2. Deck construction. There are multitudes of strategies available. I can play aggressively, defensively, go for the quick win, or play with a long threat reduction deck. I can build a deck around Hobbits, or men, or build it around powerful allies. I love being in control of my own success or demise. Each expansion adds more cards and combinations to the player pool without ruining game balance. 

1. The solo game. This game works so well as a solitaire game that I forget sometimes it is actually a coop. Often, in other games converted to solo play, I feel constricted by rules modifications. In LotR, the solo game is actually my preferred method of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Slightly disappointed with this game.  It seems to have potential if you had a bigger selection of cards.  I wish they would have started with one faction and given you a greater array of cards and then added other factions with expansions.  I feel like I will have to buy four expansions before I can truly decide if this is a good game or not.  Meh, is it worth it?

RATING: 7
Having played the game over half a dozen times at this point, both 1p and 2p, I feel I can finally make some comments about it.

It's an interesting game with some interesting mechanics. I like the deck construction aspect, and the threat level forces you to balance the numbers when it comes to your leader selection. The mechanics themselves are mostly sound, though it does feel strange that you can Quest or Fight, but can't do both. I like the idea of making Questing optional so that you can focus on combat without eating a bunch of threat level points.

As far as game play itself, things are a little shaky. There are only 3 scenarios, and as soon as things get remotely difficult, playing one-handed is simply going to be an exercise in futility. That means either running two decks or finding someone else to play. And, if one player has a "combat" deck, you're going to have to play the "quester/healer" deck, which isn't much fun.

The rules for deck construction are probably too difficult, and I quickly opted for the 40-card variant that I think was posted here. It makes more sense, and it's more fun when all you have are the core cards.

Anyway, at the end of the day, I guess I like it but I don't love it. I probably won't buy the expansions but I'll play it from time to time, at least until I can defeat the more difficult scenarios. If I ever reach that point I'll probably trade it.

RATING: 10
This is by far my favorite coop/solo game. I would go as far to say that it's one of the best coop/solo games out there. But fair warning this is not a game for casual gamers because it's complex and hard. I prefer playing this game with 2 players or if I'm by myself then 2 decks, but many solo gamers play with a single deck vs the quest. 

This is an LCG (Living Card Game) so it is encouraged that you buy the deluxe expansions and adventure packs in order to have a larger card pool to create your deck/s. For some people this might be a negative. The deluxe expansions are required for their smaller corresponding adventure packs because they come with the cards that are meant to be mixed in with them (you'll understand if you play the game). There are also saga expansions that follow along with the books. You can find out more about the different expansions at Fantasy Flight Games.

It can take a long time to build a workable deck, but that's part of the fun. Hall Of Beorn and Tales From The Cards are great websites for deck ideas. I would recommend keeping track of your deck creations by typing them out. Also this game can be very difficult but it gets easier after you know how everything works. However be prepared to lose a lot in certain quests. I like to look at the quest cards before I begin to make sure I am not required to bring anything. For example: cards to help lower my threat level or cards with the ranged keyword to attack enemies that I otherwise could not.

All and all If you like a theme rich, deep, challenging game that makes you think about your actions then this is definitely a great game to check out. If you have any questions try Google searching for answers. Or you can try asking people on Board Game Geek or the Lord of the Rings: The Card Game forum. Both sites have friendly people who are willing to answer questions.

While I am interested in trying the game again with the knowledge that you *must* use all three heroes to stand any chance on the harder levels (or so it seemed after we were overwhelmed and the slight advantage for not doing that was quickly eaten up), I'm still not convinced the game is superb.  I guess that's it - I just need to play again to know.

After my first couple of plays with this solo with the pre-constructed decks I rated the game about a 7, but with a few more solo plays it started declining to somewhere around a 5.5.

However, subsequently playing it 2-player adds a 1.5 to the rating - the game is clearly intended for 2.

Then, once you have a few expansions, the deck-building aspect really makes the game shine lifting the rating by another 1.5. So be warned, if you don't like deck-building or don't want to buy additional decks to enable the deck-building (and for additional adventures) then this is not the game for you.

I'm still really enjoying this. Also, as the card pool has extended I think solitaire is becoming an option again for me to get into. Udged up another rating point.

Note - the 3rd scenario, 'Escape form Dol Guldur', is stupidly difficult when attempted solo. There is no scaling to adjust the difficulty from being played 2-player (in which it is still hard). Don't let this put you off fro the rest of the game, the designers did get better at this kind of thing but some errata'd rules should have been fed back in to make this scenario more accessible single player - even the 'easy' mode card removals don't help much. I would probably knock 2 pts from my rating just based on the base set, because of this, but my rating is for the game overall.

Wow. What a great game. I can't believe that I missed this one. The BGG reviews and ratings weren't spectacular so I gave it a pass. A buddy bought it and wanted to try it so I did. I was blown away!

I've played over 20 solo games, a couple of two player, and three with three. I enjoyed every one of them. As a result I ordered the Core Set and all the expansions.

This will be a 10 if I'm still playing in a couple of months.

Highly recommended.

I had hoped for something exiting here with new cool ideas and never thought of ways to make a LCG. What I got was yet another standard FFG product, that is not bad but not great either. 

Honestly, apart from the cooperative aspect which is nice I see no area where this game is better than the 16 year older ME:TW. 

I might sound grumpy which I'm not, just a little bewildered why you can't come up with new mechanisms instead of just making yet another copy of Magic more or less.

Three quest only seems a little cheap as well, they could have included at least one more, but I guess the adventure packs will take care of that lack.

Beautiful artwork, great mechanics but it all just didn't come together.  It is an aggravating game with illogical rules, frustrating randomness and it all comes down to the luck of the cards.

I though Lord of the Rings: TCG was adequate, but playing it reaffirmed that I have no interested in playing it over most other two-player card games. I would much rather play Yomi, Puzzle Strike, Race For the Galaxy, or Innovation. I would nod mind playing it again, but I am not going to go out of my way to do so and found that it largely lacked tension or anything particularly interesting going on once you get a hang of the system. 

I think my problem with it may simply be be a reflection of my problem with cooperative games in general, any "system" developed for a board game has to be simple enough that by its nature it will lack the depth you can get out of a good strategic computer game thus, when push comes to shove, I will almost always end up choosing to play a good computer game over a cooperative board game.

Players take a party of heroes into Middle Earth, trying to complete quests while avoiding being thwarted by the servants of Sauron.  Simple, rather mechanical card game where players cooperate against a game driven quest.  Players go in armed with three heroes and a pre-constructed (or constructed) deck of cards.  Players step through a seven phase turn sequence; draw card, play cards, quest, engage, defend, attack, refresh.  The quest is the important bit, as you try to get to the next quest card - the rest is simply road blocks and mechanics.  Some nice ideas and plays smoothly enough.  As a 30 year LOTR fan, I didn't engage with the theme, and found myself thinking things like "was Eowyn even born at this time?", and why are two Dwarves both Steward of Gondor?  I'm not sure I'm a fan of the invented characters either.  Still, slap Lord of the Rings on it and they will come, and it certainly isn't awful, just feels clunky and dull.  Much rather break out the brilliant War of the Ring from Nexus, which is one of the greats and it nailed the theme perfectly.

Great deck construction co-operative game.  the 3 included quests are perfect.  Passage Through Mirkwood is the perfect introduction to the game, Journey Down the Anduin is still fun and engaging many years later, and Escape from Dol Guldur is still one of the hardest quests in the game.
They cover the base mechanics of the game very well, and the included cards showcase the sphere colour pie adequately, Leadership focuses on action advantage, resource acceleration, and strengthening allies; Tactics is almost completely combat-oriented, utilising armour, weapon, and item attachments to help equip your heroes and allies; Spirit excels as threat manipulation, cancellation, and high willpower for strong questing; Lore's stats are average across the board, able to fill in easily for questing, defending, or attacking as needed without focusing on any particular phase, but instead concentrates on healing, card draw acceleration, and traps.

Very complex card game with challenging decisions every play.  Great for 1 or 2.  After 100 plays and 20 expansions in I am happy to report that there are a lot of great things happening with this game that keep me coming back for more.

7 on the Cindometer - there is some "ugly" artwork that turns her off the theme, but she enjoys the cooperative aspect, and enjoys the narrative aspect.

RATING: 6.5
After 6 two-player games (6.5): The more I play the LOTR LCG, the more broken it feels.  Aside from seemingly demanding deck building from its players, the effects of shadows cards and the regular up-scaling of threats from the encounter deck work together to make the success at the game feel entirely based on exceptionally good luck at card draws.  A built deck becomes completely useless when a single "When Revealed" card can eliminate half your allies, or when you are suddenly pulling card after card into the staging area to the point that the threat level can never be realistically dealt with.  You instead feel that all the planning you put into the game ahead of time is simply overwhelmed by the volume of threats, rather than being able to fine tune your strategy as you go.  The end result is that you feel that you are playing the encounter deck, rather than having any significant role in the game's outcome.  The theme is excellent, and some of the quests retain their flavor of playing through an adventure, but over time, aside from building a deck specific to each quest that may or may not win, the repeated failures make this game more frustrating than fun.  I feel played out at the end of an LOTR game, and rarely rewarded for the effort I put in.  

Original Review: (9.7) Each of the Living Card Games has a very distinct feel; where Warhammer: Invasion feels like an action game, and Call of Cthulhu is more thoughtful, the Lord of the Rings' cooperative play and the unfolding storyline of the quest mechanic helps it to feel like a role-playing game without a lot of cumbersome mechanics to worry about.  I'd have a hard time choosing between this and Warhammer as a favorite LCG, but LOTR is a perfect way to introduce new gamers to the feel of accomplishment you can get from a good role-playing session, even if it's in card form.  An excellent game.

RATING: 7.75
I've played this quite a few times, and really enjoy it.  There's some good tension between sending your guys on the quest to advance and fighting off the various baddies that the deck spawns.  I like the variety in the quests I've seen: some are more exploration-focused, some more about combat, and others are your hunt-the-maguffin or escort missions.  The deckbuilding likewise is pretty interesting, since each faction has different strengths, and you'll need some more than others depending on the scenario.  Once you get more cards, you'll have some more choices as to what kind of thing to include.  Of course, they do that annoying FFG thing where they only include 1 or 2 copies of key cards in the core set, but I suppose you can always proxy them - it is a co-op after all.

The design does have a couple flaws.  I'm going to compare it here to 2 other card games which share some mechanical similarities.  One is, of course, Magic, which gets compared to everything.  The other is Sentinels, which is substantially different in many respects, but has some comparable patterns in how it plays out.
A co-op card game like this is interesting because of the uncertainty of what hazards the central deck will spit out at you.  All deck-based games like these have the weakness that the deck may produce a super-hard, unbeatable game or an easy one depending on the shuffle.  I don't know that this one is as prone to the problem as the others and don't consider it a big deal, but it's still there.
These games also have certain play patterns.  At the start, you have few resources and a hand full of cards.  As the game progresses, you build up your board state and become more powerful, but only get 1 new card a turn, so you deplete your hand unless you're drawing extra.  The critical point is at the start, since that's when you are at your weakest, and have to invest in things that will be useful later.  If the game throws too many monsters at you in the very beginning, you'll have to burn so many resources just staying alive that you're likely to sink into a downward spiral.  Careful planning and clever card play will only get you so far.    LotR is quite 'bad' in this respect, since your sole source of income in most cases is hero cards.  Each hero produces 1 resource, so this means that you're getting 3 bucks each turn for the whole game.  You never produce more outside of special cards, only 1 of which is in the core game.  The cards in your hand range from cost 1 all the way up to 6.  The 1s &2s are still useful, but if you want any chance at all of playing the big 6-costers, you'll have to save up for 2 full turns.  This is hugely restrictive, and means that expensive cards aren't likely to get much use.  
Magic is ruled by the 1-land-per-turn restriction.  You start with little ability to play cards, then each turn (for at least the first few), you get more resources, until in the late game you can play your big finishers.  You can't save over mana from turn to turn, though.  Sentinels is a little different in that cards don't have costs associated with them, you just play them.  Most heroes, though, still require multiple plays to build up to their full strength.  My point here is that, in other games, you have more of a chance to build up your production.  The fact that, in LotR, you start with 3 and can only go down from there (if one of your heroes dies) means that getting a foothold early is absolutely critical.  Pretty much everything about the game requires you to play more units, or 'allies', since you need to send them on quests, have them soak up hits instead of your heroes, and band together to overcome the defense on monsters.  The game is very demanding of manpower in this way.  If you have the chance to build up your army a little, you can parlay that into greater success.  If you can't afford them, or have to sacrifice them in combat as soon as you play them, you'll struggle to advance.  I've played many times, and the easiest games have been ones in which we drew, in our opening hands, that one card I alluded to earlier.  This 'Steward of Gondor' card produces 2 extra resources per turn, at a cost of 2 to play out.  That's 66% more production every turn after the first, on which it pays for itself.  There's a reason Sol Ring is so strong in Magic.  You don't realize how much that cost bottleneck limits what you can do in the game until it's lifted.  So, in summary, I don't really like this way of paying for cards, and things that get around that restriction are bonkers powerful.
Worse still, the 4 factions in the game can be mixed and matched, but only under severe restrictions.  Each hero is assigned to one role, and the resources they make are of that role's 'color', or faction.  When you're using those resources to pay for things, they can only be spent on cards from the matching faction (or the handful of neutral cards that exist).  Each card must be paid for with [i]entirely[/i] faction-matching resources.  (Picture trying to play a red/green deck where [i]every[/i] 2-drop cost RR or GG, every 3-drop was RRR or GGG, etc.  It just wouldn't work.)  This means that if you decide to mix factions, 1 of your 3 starting heroes will be off-color, so you'll be hugely limited in what cards of that faction you can include.  Even a relatively cheap 3-cost card (which you could ordinarily play on the 1st turn) will now require you to save up for 3 whole turns.  And now, your primary faction has had its budget slashed as well, and you'll have to save up longer to play costly cards, or just not include them.  There are 'song' cards which mitigate this by making one of your heroes 2-color, but my impression was that they were pretty weak, and you have to draw them early if they're to be of any use.  Plus, you're investing some of your precious early resources just to get back near the functionality that pure-color decks have to start.
The threat system is another minor annoyance.  At the start, you sum the threat values on your heroes, so the more powerful crew you take, the more likely you are to attract attention.  If you don't send enough guys on the quest, or get swamped with cards, your threat will skyrocket (the difference in your quest value and the combined threat of the central display is how much you gain/lose), causing more enemies to attack you.  This means you'll have to devote troops to fending them off &/or killing them, leaving fewer to quest, etc.  You're also on a timer, and threat ticks up by 1 every turn no matter what you do.  Now, you can attempt to do a stealthy run, where you use 2 or only 1 hero.  This will set your starting threat really low.  I admit I've never actually tried playing this way, but it seems to me that in most scenarios, this is going to be a huge mistake.  Permanently slashing your income by a large fraction is a massive deal, and the threat you'll save will likely be regained in a turn or 2 when you can't muster the manpower to stay ahead in the quest race.
Oh, and the deck-building rules are a little off in my estimation.  They want you to make a 50-card minimum deck, but you'll struggle to make 40 w/out including too much filler.  (This will change as you get more cards, to be certain, but you'll probably need more than the first set of packs to feel like you have some good choices.)

In general, this is still a fun game that I enjoy playing.  Trouble is, it's a pretty big money sink.  The club has the base set and the first several packs, but you'd have to play this one a [i]lot[/i] to justify buying all the expansions for it.  I can't, and don't know anyone who does, so it's not one I'll likely play much more.

I love the theme of this game. I think the artwork is fantastic. I really like that the game can be played solo, though I find it to be very difficult to play that way. I find 2-3 players is the sweet spot. I'm somewhat frustrated with FFG with regards to the card allocation in the Core Set. Fortunately I don't feel the need to have three of every card. If you like LoTR I recommend giving this one a try.

RATING: 4
After two plays, I'm not impressed with the game; it's okay but nothing remarkable.  Add that to my lack of interest in building decks makes this a definite pass for me.

Also irksome is FFG adding in their fanfic characters as though they were canonical, and supplying somewhat-related quotes from the trilogy at the bottom to try and make it look authentic.  The whole feel of it is much closer to Dragonlance (or some other generic fantasy doorstop) than Tolkien.

The level of abstraction is also odd, resting uncomfortably between the gentle simplicity of Knizia's LOTR co-op (on one hand) and the sprawling simulationism of WOTR (on the other).  Both of these feel more authentic than the card game though -- I think the light theming of Knizia allows the player to project their experience onto the scaffolding of the mechanics, whereas the high level of detail in WOTR produces that feel just by following the rules.  The co-op card game has just enough rules to pull you away from the experience, but not enough to simulate what's actually going on.  The result is a very gamey feel that has nothing to do with LOTR.

Apparently this is doing quite well for FFG sales-wise.  More power to them, but I have zero interest in playing this again.

Un cooperativo muy difÃ­cil, se juega perfectamente en solitario y la partida a dos con la jefa, ella ha sufrido el efecto magic y no le ha gustado, tanto como a mi. Hemos llegado al segundo paso de la misiÃ³n y hemos sido masacrados por las araÃ±as XD

[b]Contras:[/b] Por 40 euros, hay mucho aire en la caja y pocas cartas (se necesitan 50 para hacer un mazo reglamentario y hay 30 por cada uno de los cuatro colores). Sino te gusta magic, huele mucho a eso, tampoco creo que te guste este...

[b]Pros:[/b] Combinar tus fuerzas para superar las peligrosas misiones, en la tierra media. Se explica y juega una misiÃ³n en 40min, es Ã¡gil y aunque no lo parezca por la enorme caja, ocupa muy poco. 
Aunque es un CDG como magic al no ser un VS, no existe la presiÃ³n de tener el mejor mazo, para poder disfrutar con los colegas; ya simplemente con la caja bÃ¡sica hay mucho juego por delante y te puedes pillar las expansiones con las tramas que te gusten y ya.

[i]Se queda con el 7 hasta que lo pruebe con mi cuÃ±aete que le fue tanto el magic como a mi[/i] ;)

We got into this game to give the 'living card game' genre a shot.  It's been fun so far; my partner and I have really enjoyed trying out the different cards.  Right now I am playing a lore and tactics heavy deck.  I can't see us every giving up this game.

We found this game takes a lot of teamwork and a good understanding of how to play your deck to win.  Expect more losses than victories when you are first starting out.

UPDATE: it feels that FFG took a lot of lessons from this to make the Arkham Horror card game, which I like much better. I never really got into deck building and found the gameplay kind of clunky here.

UPDATE: I'm torn on this one. On one hand, I like that it's a co-op game with solitaire playability, but on the other hand it has FFG's usual clunkiness in gameplay. (Compare to CoC and it's obvious which game was made by FFG and which game they acquired.)

An interesting co-op game with tons of flavor. I have concerns about the LCG format for other games (like CoC which I own) but since it's a co-op game you don't really need to keep buying to "stay competitive." (On the other hand, each expansion gives you more scenarios to play so I guess it's easier to get them at your own pace.)

RATING: 5
-CCG like gameplay (check)
-Cooperative/Solo play (check)
-Large replay value (check)

So why am I only rating this a 5?  This should easily be a 9 for me based on the above criteria.  Where did it go wrong?  No where actually.  It seems that my habits have changed and I have been spoiled by tableau building card games such as Race/Gosu that I really abhor the time consumption of deck building.  It's quite strange as it was one of my favorite activities when I was into Magic: The Gathering.  I also can't really stomach paying $15/month + about $25 twice yearly.  I just don't like the idea of this constant money drain even though it does add a significant number of options.

Money and deck building aren't my only issues with the game however.  The game doesn't really scale well at this point in time.  The solo game with one player deck is the most difficult way to play.  Each player added makes the game significantly easier.  It's probably optimal as a two player game.  Beyond that, I really feel like there is some harsh randomness in the event/shadow deck which can really mess up your game.  Sometimes I feel the same can be said about other co-ops, but sometimes I feel there is a lot more randomness in this than other co-ops.  Finally, even with 3 Core Sets for maximum deck building possibilities, it just doesn't seem to offer wide variety at this point.  One of the Sphere's of Influence only has 3 different type of creatures.  In fact you can't even make a tournament legal deck of a single sphere and even when it get's to that point there won't be much deck building to it.

My final issue with the game is that with so many scenarios, it seems like eventually your deck is going to hit a scenario that just can't be beaten.  At this point you can make a deck that's a silver bullet but where's the fun in that?

I do think this is a great game for many reasons but it's just one that isn't for me due to the deck constructions and upkeep cost. If these weren't issues, I would still much rather play Netrunner.  Now that WHQACG is available, it's a good alternative to this for my tastes.

This living card game (LCG) is HARD and yet I keep coming back for more.  First heard about it on Watch It Played and needless to say, I was hooked on it.  You feel like you are on an epic quest and the odds are always against you, but there is a ray of hope (especially if you pull out Gandalf at the right moment).  The game has only 3 scenarios, but they are fun and difficult to conquer almost begging you to keep coming back to try and do better.  Haven't played with any expansions yet, but they are always in the back of my mind.  Hard to impossible to solo, but great fun if you have two people really working together.

I hate that FFG uses own characters instead of 100% Tolkien. Why, oh why did they have do that? This turns the me down quite a bit, and it also turns me down that it seems to be just another game where you have invest a lot of money to get the full experience.

The LOTR theme is enjoyable as always.  Haveing a 2p cooperative is very nice.  Not many of those.
The game machanic is very good and the cards are supper cool.  I love the Living Card Game genre as a whole.
The three nagatives here are that you really need a few expansions to get a decent deck, many of the adventures are too hard, and the deck-building is overly laborious.

Pros:

Cons:
- Land lock problem with larger number of players
- Difficult for solo play with some quests almost unbeatable without going two-handed
- Turn structure is clunky
- Location (travel phase) is not realistic and poorly implemented
- Multiple quests requires specific deck building to boost chance of succeeding

RATING: 6.5
After getting a few expansions, I got bored of the game. It has some really nice mechanics, the scenarios are somewhat entertaining... but I think that actually the fun part of the game comes from the "I WANNA ALL THESE NEW CARD" thing, which I tried to not get involved into anymore.

I will play it again sporadically, but I'm not in the mood of buying new expansion packs. Rating downgraded from an initial 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Game plays well as a 2 player game, and is girlfriend/wife friendly.  The variety in the base set is pretty lacking even in 2 player though, as constructing 2-3 sphere decks is almost strictly a disadvantage with only a single core set.  The 1, 3, and 4 player rules seem like they were not even playtested for balance.  I have never lost a 3-4 player game of any scenario, even when teaching people the game.  The 1 player game, however, is the opposite end of the spectrum, where only the 1st scenario is beatable without a ton of luck, and the Tactics deck will lose to even the 1st scenario 75% of the time.
In the end, wins and losses feel much more like they are determined by luck than anything else.  Making lots of wrong decisions will still get you a win in 3-4 player, and making 100% perfect decisions will usually still get you a loss in 1 player.

RATING: 10
This game has been a revelation to me in that I never was a M:tG fan and had a predisposition against any sort of a CCG, LCG, or pre-play deck building -- yet after two years of playing, I love this game and rate it a 10. I never suspected that Iâd fall for the game the way I have to point of enjoying the pre-play deck building and buying so many expansions, but I do and I have. 

The brilliance of the game is how it succeeds in terms of richness of gameplay, cooperative interaction, and theme. The game is simply the best implementation, IMO, of what a gamerâs game, strategic coop should be. Building a deck that hums with card synergies engrosses me every play, and the way the game renders specific situations â be it going down the Anduin in a boat or getting shot at by guards behind a gate â is the definition of thematic to me. 

The way the victory conditions differ greatly from scenario to scenario keeps the experience fresh in ways that other games wish they could. And unlike other cooperative games where players are co-contributing more than co-operating, LOTR:TCG gives players plenty of options for playing cards to assist one another at every phase of the game while still leaving room for autonomy and individual creativity. I have a monthly cooperative game group and we're all-in on LOTR:TCG.

Great artwok. Game too mechanic, no feeling of adventure. Once you shuffle your deck and needed cards are on the bottom, you can't win.
Spending hours to create decks is not for me.

RATING: 7
A tough game so far. The second quest, A Journey Down the Anduin, has resisted all efforts to defeat it thus far (after 5 efforts, all solitaire). Still, I keep coming back for more.

Update - Journey Down the Anduin finally defeated after 13 attempts. I've given up on Escape from Dol Guldur after 3 goes. Brutal for the solitaire player usign the core cards. 

Overall, LOTR:tCG would be an 8 if it had been better calibrated for solitaire players like me. As it stands, Anduin is extremely difficult and Dol Guldur impossible.

There are a lot of people who really like this game; I am not one of them.  I don't enjoy deck construction, the encounters felt very random with the unknown potential for crushing abilities to be drawn, and the overly-complicated turn structure (not the most complex I've played, but certainly felt the most tedious).  This game was replaced by Dungeon Crawler - provides the same same general adventure feel of LoTR without all the stuff I don't like.

Very nice game. Gets better when played with a friend who is interested in LotR. Too difficult to win playing solo even with deck building. Play with two decks like a two player game even if you play solo. That makes things easier. Luck is an important factor as drawing certain enemies and not drawing a good hand can cause disaster even in the first turn. Not very hard to learn the rules, but one needs to find some anwers to questions here in BGG as the rulebook misses some special cases.

Recommended.

So, this game turns out to be totally addictive. Unfortunately, part of that addiction is centered around purchasing new expansions to get better cards for the players' decks.

The game was very hard to play using just the Core Set. Adding expansion cards helped a lot. So far, deck building in this game has been constrained by a lack of ally choices in Leadership and Spirit. My aforesaid addiction to purchasing expansions will no doubt solve that problem eventually.

In certain scenarios one player can find themselves having the same role every turn (defend/defend/defend or quest/quest/quest). That can get tedious. Also, we've found the game causing some tension between players over resource allocation, determining who can take the hit, and wanting to protect your characters vs protecting the other player's characters. That's probably both a strength and a weakness of the game. But since I value cooperation, I dislike the grasping, selfish feelings the game can occasionally engender in me when it starts to feel like my side of the team is getting chipped away. That may fade with time as I become more accustomed to losing allies/heroes -- or when I become a better person ;)

Tolkien purists may object to building decks that combine characters in ways that contradict the cannon. As, for example, taking a deck full of elves, horses, and eages into Moria, or playing characters together who never met. I couldn't care less about that kind of thing. I want a powerful deck with synergy. I enjoy using characters I remember from the books (and I grow fond of my heroes), but I don't care if the characters in my deck lived a hundred years and a thousand miles apart or never met.

All those warning aside, I'm thinking right this moment of when my next game can happen.  Addicting is a tame word for how much I like it. The game keeps the suspense going and doesn't take it easy on the players.  And, of course, the theme can't be beat.

Wat mij betreft een absolute must have voor de echte solo gamer. Prachtig artwork. Voor de doorgewinterde gamer zijn de spelregels te overzien. Voor de beginner adviseer ik even een paar Youtube filmjes te bekijken voor extra speluitleg. Moeilijkheidsgraad is met wat huisregels makkelijk aan te passen van 'easy-going' tot 'bruut'. Er zijn heel veel uitbreidingen te koop maar met het basisspel kun je echt wel een tijdje vooruit. Neem even de tijd voor het spel want 90 minuten vliegen zomaar voorbij.

No obstante, entre los inconvenientes seÃ±alo:
- Sacacuartos. El base viene con pocas cartas y pocas misiones, se ven que no se han dado cuenta y ahora van a tener que sacar expansiones (si tienes detector de sarcasmos, ya debe estar roto). Al menos en Ãºltima instancia que te saquen los cuartos depende de ti, pero al menos un par expansiones para tener algo de variedad la verdad es que son necesarias.

I've learned one thing: Never trust a game with scenarios. Once you're done with a scenario, you don't want to  play it again. And so it is the case in LOTR. 3 scenarios, 3 games, thank you. No need to go through them again. What is the point? To go through the same scenario with different heroes/player cards? Oh please!

Dissappointed in this as the enemy deck feels like it has too many locations and to be able to play and stand a chance of winning you HAVE to play the blue sphere of influence.

Great game.  Extremely thematic, solid mechanics, and very diverse due to the scenario-oriented design.  Every scenario is a new challenge.  Possibly the best of the LCG's that I have played to date.

Rating based on core set play only.  I have the first 6 adventure packs but haven't gotten to them yet.  I really don't foresee finding anything in those packs that will dampen my enthusiasm for the game though.  In fact, I fully expect the addition of more cards and scenarios to make the game even richer and more exciting.

I love the fact that the art is hand-painted, as opposed to movie stills.  Great decision that makes the game much more timeless, like the books themselves.  I'm a fan of the movies, but I vastly prefer the hand-painted art to the movie stills featured in the older LotR card game.

What surprises me most in this fine card game is the dependable emergence of thrilling stories from its simple structure. The three very different scenarios in the core set showcase the versatility of the system, both in variety of play and in difficulty scaling. It did not need to be the most beautiful card game in print, but it is too. Production and play are so top notch that I cannot but find laughable the hype behind a much inferior [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133038/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-rise-runelords-base]other fantasy card game[/url] that was redundantly published two years after LotR. If Fury of Dracula is the best board game adaptation of a literary work, LotR LCG must be the best card game adaptation. It can be a tiring game; depending on the number of allies and enemies in play, a typical turn will involve many checks and calculations (reminiscent of Core Worlds). I also suspect the optimal configuration with two players is having one as a main combat deck (Leadership and Tactics) and the other as a support deck (Spirit and Lore), which can render the game less interesting for the supporting player. But the jury is still out about that.

[b]Divested myself of all LotR:CG. Just too fiddly and too difficult (even on Easy mode). Shame. Art is amazing, encounter deck is clever.[/b]

Played 20+ times with 1-3 players.

Dec 2011: Two parts Magic the Gathering, one part Knizia's Lord of the Rings co-op. My first four games were all against the first quest, one game each with each sphere deck just to learn what each deck could and couldn't do. Very impressed with the game design. If they had included just 3 more quests in the box, or would sell a special quest pack so I could play more with the base game, I think this would be a 10 for me. As is, it's a 9, and I can't see any way this game would ever fall below 8 for me.

Jan 2012: I find that the hard challenges are quite hard, which, in theory is good. But it means I can never play this game casually or with non-gamers. I need people (with decks, preferably) who specialize in this game. That - in my opinion - is not a good quality in a game.

March 2014: Played with two new players in a 3-player game, and everyone had a blast. This is scratching my Magic itch, but without the money-sink and power-differential problem. This game is about to take a lot of money out of my wallet...

August 2015: As a solo game (the only way I play it), it's too fiddly, too difficult, and too time-consuming.

I was a little wary of trying a Living Card Game, but picked it up at a FLGS while on a business trip in Saskatoon while hankering for a game that can play solitaire. Fantasy Flight has done a great job with incorporating the world of Middle-Earth into a very challenging experience that can generate all kinds of stories. While like many games it can be reduced to a number-crunching exercise, it can be as thematic as the player wants to be. So far, I'm surprised at just how difficult this game appears to be.

Great game. Artwork is beautiful and once you understand the rules the game plays well. Really like the fact that, like the LotR, you have a small party which goes on quests.

The game isn't very easy to win especially as a solo player game. Once you want to win scenario's higher than level 3 you'll probably need to get some expansions.

Good game but lots of luck required to win solo. (edit) Actually learned how to beat the game and now win most of the time solo on most quests. Also helped to add more expansions to give me more options.

I've played this game to death and I'm now bored with it. The problem seems to be that I've made 2 decks that work in most situations and playing those same decks over and over and over again is just boring.

Great game solo and for 2. (can't speak of more players)
I like it that diferent decks play really different. Most scenarios have a different flavor and the special rules for each scenario transport the theme greatly. 
What I don't love as much:
- deck building can take some time and if you want to play another deck than the last time you have to plan some time.
- Some scenarios aren't that great. If you want to win the possibilities are too restricted. Some Scenarios aren't well designed for single-handed sologames. They are too hard or just don't transport the special theme of the scenario. Some adventurecards are too strong. They make the scenario a hit or miss - if I encounter this special card I will die otherwise I will win.

RATING: 8
Pros: Beautiful artwork; complex, but not convoluted rules and structure; don't need a ton of table space to play (at least solo or coop); strong replay value; good solo game; interesting mechanics; living card game format allows for less "luck" in buying cards and forming decks; deck building is fun

Cons: LCG format can still be expensive to build up a strong collection; Luck of the draw is too often the reason for a win or a loss (although deck building strategy matters most); uneven difficulty based upon solo vs coop and across varying "official" difficulty levels of scenarios; some quests very frustrating to beat (this could be seen as a pro too)

Overall: I think this is a great game, especially for someone who can't always get together a group on a regular basis to play, the game is more than adequate solo.

[i]July 2012[/i]: Rating of 7. Fallen out of favor and put on my trade list. It's a pain to keep up with the new cards every few months.
[i]May 2011[/i]: Rating of "8". Very good, fun game. Regret not buying the game sooner. Awesome value for the money. The theme and gameplay are compelling and could see the rating increasing to a "9".

[u]Pros:[/u] 
+Oozes with Narrative flavour. As with many the other thematic games I like (Arkham Horror, Thunderstone), I have a great time even when I lose
+STUNNING & FANTASTIC art on all of the game components. Even cardboard tokens don't feel like cardboard game chits
+Easy to learn the basic rules. Was able to get a good handle on the rules within a couple of games.
+Great potential. Looking forward to new cards, heroes, etc. With FFG, there are sure to be expansions. 
+Good amount of replayability

[i]Cons (and rebuttals): [/i]
-Few scenarios (but great replayability)
-Quite a few amiguities in the cards and rules (which are mostly addressed via the unofficial FAQs here on BGG)
-Compels completists and tourney players to buy multiple sets (but no one is holding a dagger at your throat to buy more)
-Poor card storage (e.g. No dividers)

Holy shit.  Static, constricted, repetitive gameplay combined with an AVALANCHE of expansions?  I'm glad I bailed when I did.  It's exciting to play this at first--you get the warm and fuzzy CCG feeling.  A dozen plays later after you've seen all the base game has to offer, you realize...it doesn't get any better.

I am so glad I bailed on this when I did.  FFG seems content to churn out an endless supply of these cards...no, thank ya

One of the best. The theme/gameplay connection  in this game is so rich, it will draw you in, even if you aren't the hugest LOTR fan. It's telling that I've spent way,way more on this game than on any other game in my collection. I'm trying to limit the expansions I buy now, as I have enough variety to last a life time (17 expansions...!).  In my top 10 games of all time, easily.

RATING: 7
Relatively easy to play, but difficult to win. The game is rather convoluted, but it is those convolutions which make it the game that it is and separates it from other card games of this type. As such, I think you either like it or your don't. Oddly enough, I say that, but I think I'm in the middle. I like the theme (of course!) and the flow, but really didn't care for some of the mechanics and the way the game forces everything to get to a situation where players will die 75% of the time and it is only on the best of luck on the next few card pulls that will determine whether there is a reprieve. I honestly didn't feel like the decisions I was make was having the kind of critical impact that engages me in a game like this. That aside, the game is easy enough to play that I would try it again if asked, but I wouldn't invest in it myself, especially considering its LCG thang, which I've sort of told myself I wouldn't sink into (I've already got X-Wing to dump all my cash into!)

RATING: 8
An interesting cooperative game, with innovative mechanics.
Nevertheless, deckbuilding is rather hard with a single box.
Moreover, the game mechanics are punishing. Thus, the game is really hard to win as a single player.

I will follow the forthcoming extensions to see the new cards.

Bought this one last summer but for some reason it has been left unplayed until now. My first impressions is that it's an interesting cooperative cardgame with a reasonable playtime.

Awesome 1-2 player card game set in Lords of the Ring universe. As opposed to Middle Earth Quest you can play main heroes from the original novels (Aragorn etc.). Quick setup time and different ways to play for each hero make for a fun game that doesn't get old, not so long as there are scenarios for it anyway.

RATING: 7
Not very enthusiastic about this game. I never felt compelled to customize my decks much, and the base game didn't grab me enough to make me buy many more expansions than the first couple of mission packs.  I think FFG needs to re-release a standalone set with some more missions and enough deck material to give someone on a budget a fighting chance at completing future scenarios. As it stands, what I've got is kind of frustrating and bland.

Edit 2/2015: I'm going to purchase and complete the first adventure cycle and give this game another shot. If it doesn't pass muster after the cycle is finished, it will be given away or mothballed.

One of my favorite games right now. It has drawbacks in the form of unclear rules and dubious theme implementation in the game mechanics (for example, why do the enemies use both defense and attack, while the heroes and allies must choose which to use?), but with the hugely varied scenarios, it's great! And it can be played solo, which is why I bought it in the first place. That, and it being LOTR.

The art on the cards is outstanding and I like that the game is coop. But it is just too complicated for me. I needed to watch many videos and read the rules so many times to get to play the game. It is quite daunting at first. And I just did not have much fun playing. I did not really understand which decision I had to make and they certainly didn't feel exciting. I thought the game didn't flow very well. Just not for me I guess..

Playing [b][i]Lord of the Rings LCG[/i][/b] feels like you're going on a quest through Arda. That's what I wanted from this game and the game delivers. It's great in groups, but best (for me) as a solitaire game. It's been my favorite solitaire game from the time I first quested with the starter decks in Mirkwood; the expansion packs have only increased my enjoyment. The quests are thematic, the gameplay is evocative, and the art is fantastic.

When the game was first released the rules were a bit vague in places, but this has largely been corrected through FFG's FAQs. Specific quests don't always scale to different numbers of players, but this just makes some quests more easy or difficult--not a big deal in a cooperative game. You probably would want to buy into the quest packs to achieve serious replay-ability; the added player cards and new quests really opens up the game. Quest variability, while a good thing for overall game variability, does mean that some quests are really good while others are just okay. And because this game heavily depends on the thematic material, I don't think I can recommend it to somebody who is unfamiliar with Tolkien's world.

[b]Passage Through Mirkwood (1):[/b] This is a great introductory quest. The difficulty level is perfect; you'll probably lose your first time, but after you learn the game you will win every time. It's thematic and made me imagine I was entering Mirkwood. I particularly like the random objective for the 3rd portion of the quest.

[b]Journey Down the Anduin (4):[/b] Some people say this quest is too difficult for a Core Set quest. Perhaps this is correct because it seems to be a popular belief as evidenced by numerous threads discussing how to beat this quest. I, however, think this is a perfect 2nd quest. It is difficult, but you can regularly win with cards available from a single core set and the difficulty makes the victories sweet. It also shows you something new in the quest formula that hints at future possibilities. The difficulty level, fun story cleverly translated to gameplay mechanics, and overall tough choices on when to advance the quest make this my favorite core set scenario.

[b]Escape from Dol Guldur (7):[/b] This remains the most difficult solo quest. I wish this quest better scaled to one player, but I also enjoy the tremendous difficulty. It's not impossible for one player to win with just the core set, but it is unlikely and difficult.

This is a very punishing game.  In my solo excursions so far, I have not been able to venture beyond the first Mirkwood quest card.

1st game: tactics deck only.  I lost quickly by threat without being able to quest very far at all.

2nd game: tactics (1 char) and lore (2 char): pulverized.  I traveled a little farther but my characters got slaughtered.

3rd game: tactics (2 char) + Glorfindel Killed quickly by Chief Ufthak and a Beastmaster.

I'm moderately enjoying it, I really do think it's a great concept and I like the attempt to put adventuring and locations in the game instead of just fighting.  Unfortunately it is brutally procedural, especially for such a short game.  There's so much procedure I have a hard time getting into a rhythm with the game.  That is critical for me with solitaire games, otherwise it's just an extended bookkeeping.

Also, the whole character defends and uses shields but is then exhausted and needs someone else to attack monsters just doesn't really make any sense to me and seems artificially limiting.  All characters feel like attacking or defending wall cards from MtG or something.  There's tons of just getting as many shitty units, sorry, "allies," to be suicided on the tough monsters...  not terribly heroic, that.  Aragorn: "random guard guy!  Go defend against that orc group and die while I go around behind them and beat the crap out of them!"

This is one of those games I want to see the next iteration of, because this one is just a little lacking of something.  

Edit: this game is FIRED from my collection in a world where Pathfinder exists.  I know this game is harder and not exactly the same type of game, but man is Pathfinder more fun.

This is a tough one to rate. I enjoyed playing this a lot, but I didn't expect there to be deck-building when you get into the expansions. I have interest in playing the game, but I am past the point of having any interest in building a deck and trying it against a scenario.

I've been enjoying this game quite a bit. I think once i start using deck building options and go through the more advanced scenarios it will be even more enjoyable. I like that there is no real deck building mechanic during the game. I also like the cooperative element, it is sort of what I like from thunderstone minus the deck building which is a mechanic I do not enjoy much. Look forward to more plays.

This is sort of what I wish thunderstone was. Coop card play vs a very strong game senario. This game is a lot of fun, particularly after exploring various deck building options. It really does bring me back to playing games like Magic when I was in junior high and it is simply a well made game that is a lot of fun with the right players or solitaire.

First time I have bought or played a Card Game. Three things interested me in this. (1) it is co-op (1-4 players), (2) it can be experienced solo, (3) it is Middle Earth!

OK, I am a board gamer, not a card player, so this was a stretch. But I took the plunge early Jan 2013 and bought it, and tried it out. Result....I enjoyed it. It was everything I was hoping. Challenging, enjoyable, Middle Earth richness. Tried it with my 21 yo son, and he enjoyed it as well. It will get many plays from me and my wife. And I have already started down the expansions path....I think they reeled me in on this one.

Not bad, but only worth investing in if you know at least one other person who is willing to take on the investment with you.  Otherwise, I don't think playing it solo is enjoyable enough to make it worthwhile, even if it is a little fun that way.  But that's just my opinion.

I just find the idea of a co-op LCG to be a strange idea.  It challenges the idea of all LCGs or CCGs being strictly competitive, which is an interesting idea.

I'm not a card game fan but this game has its appeal 'cause the Tolkien universe. The art on the cards really get you immerse in Middle Earth and the adventure system tells a story. The ugly is that it's extremely difficult, next to impossible in some cases if you don't own expansions or play with two people. Only some adventures are for one player, others you need a companion. It's kind of cool but if you are a solo player you finally get bored of losing so much.

Most cooperative games seem to use the same formula; having a scenario where semi-random threats are appearing in a never ending fashion. This game is no exception to that. Personally, I found this to be one of the stronger games of that genre because of the theme and the strong deck building aspect. When we play, we usually choose two spheres and build a deck around it and then play the scenario and then maybe make adjustments.

Some plays can leave you a little sour and that is especially true when they are stalling. With the releases of more adventure packs I suspect the game will be even more fun.

I donât have experience playing collectible card games because I usually shield away from them because of the collectable nature, but because I can build a deck right before I play, the non-collectable aspect and it is cooperative makes me interested in digging deeper into the game.

It is easy to get discouraged with this game, particularly as you are learning how to play. The game punches hard, and you are frequently overwhelmed before you can get your feet under you. There's really little to do except shrug and re-deal. Push through the pain and you will find a richly-themed game, and rich theme is where it's at when I play solo. (Partner play is fun, too). Each scenario is a puzzle solved by deck-building and tactics. When you've beaten a scenario there isn't much incentive to return, unless you like deck building for its own sake (I don't) or you want to improve your score (I record them but don't put much stock in them). Particularly enjoy playing through the Saga expansion, with scenarios directly inspired by the books.

RATING: 6
Highly thematic but not as deep in gameplay. It felt overly complicated, lots of phases to basicly just make
two tests; one for the will power within the adventure and one for the fighting strength when facing enemies.
The decisions you make like "will I block with this character or should I use him to attack?" are comparable to MtG.
So it didn't felt that unique as I expected based on reviews. Still an OK game underneath all this chrome.
Strange: "if you buy another base game you can play up to four players" -> you can already do so with one base
game. There are enough cards (factions) in it. The only thing that is missing are the threat-counters. Not fair from FFG to urge you buying a whole second game for basicly just the counters you will need... however I wouldn't play it with more than two player due to expected downtime.

Dropped this for a year and a half, after trying the base game and finding it wanting. After a few games with multiple core sets and expansions, have raised my rating. It's a lot of fun getting together with a like minded friend and working out the arithmetic.

Solo? That's a different experience. It sucks. Most scenarios are  unplayable with just one hero deck, and if I have to play two, well, why not just call any other game a solo game?

I have to admit that I simply don't get it. Turns a rich literary achievement into a dry, card-pushing exercise in basic arithmetic (though something similar can be said about much contemporary "thematic" fantasy).

This is a game that can really morph into a hobby. I love it, and I have picked up quite a few packs for it.

Basically, I have been out of Magic the Gathering for years and years. But I always loved deckbuilding and playing. 

LotR: LCG scratches that deckbuilding itch, and the fact that it's cooperative suits my personal tastes extremely well. Everybody who likes Magic that I've played with has gotten into this. 

That said, it is very challenging. It is also pretty fiddly, since there are so many keywords and things to track in the middle of the game. But the fact that it's mainly restricted to 1 or 2 players mitigates the boredom one might feel while fiddling with stuff. 

If you have a gaming partner with the appropriate Magic-like disposition, this is a fantastic game with wonderfully crafted scenarios.

My favorite adventure card game right now. 3 or 4 scenarios that you can play with 4 different groups of heros, so replay is pretty high even without buying any expansions. Can support 3 or 4 players if you buy a second core set. The theme comes through loud and clear, and the game's atmosphere strongly evokes the novels that inspired the game.

UPDATE: I'm really enjoying this game solo, it pops into my head unbidden, like a good book or movie will. Raised the rating to a 9; may go up when I try my first 2+ player game.

RATING: 9
So I've tried all the decks solo against the first scenario and I can't help but notice how imbalanced they are this way.  It's still fun even when you lose, especially when it's the final questing action when you think you've won and you draw the one card that assures your defeat - the Ungoliant's Spawn!  What were the odds?!
So now, I want to try it with 2  players and see how the decks mingle.  More Gandalf cards please!
---
It's frustrating that the cap for copies of the same card included in a player's deck is 3, but the base game only includes 2 (and sometimes only 1!) copy of several cards.  The expansion packs don't have this problem, so why does the base set?  Seems a shame to have to buy 2 copies of the base game to get as much out of it as possible.
---
Conceptually I love this game, but practically, it's falling flat for me.  The appeal of this game for me is in the deck building.  However, there are a few things working against this enjoyment.  First off, there aren't enough cards to really build interesting decks unless you're willing to invest hundreds of dollars on 2 base sets and all the expansions whose costs really add up.  But the thing that actually bugs me is having to break down and rebuild for each adventure.  A deck that would excel hunting for Gollum would likely do miserably at the Carrock, but I want my well tuned deck to be able to handle any adventure, in its own way.  I think this box will start collecting dust...
---
A recent play has rekindled my interest in playing this one some more. I've realized that the solo experience for me isn't where this game shines. I much prefer this game as a 2 player co-op. Each player makes their own decisions when playing their hands and both contribute to the win/loss. Also, by ignoring the mini expansions I think I can get some more mileage out of this game. 
---
Also, the Solo playing 2 players variant is great fun, though a little busy on the table.
---
I finally get it. Deck building for individual quests is fun, and not even that time consuming if you know your cards. Watching your machine come to life is very satisfying (when it works) and I can't wait to get more expansions an more quests. Reading strategy forums really helped me understand the deck building process a lot better.

Not as excited about it as I thought I was going to be.  It looks like it is going to need more deckbuilding time than I had hoped.  Interesting game, but after first scenario it seems really hard.  I can't even fathom how to do the 3rd scenario since I was destroyed before getting one foot going in the 2nd scenario with a starter deck.  It looks like you'll have to fine tune a deck for each scenario; I was hoping it would be more of a "pick up and play" type game.

RATING: 3
Or: âHow to make a mess of a fine gameâ.

The system works well, and it could have been a great solo diversion (fun, fast, just the right amount of luck)â¦ if only they balanced it right!

As it is, the solo mode is so difficult to win (except for 1 of the 3 scenarios included) that it all boils down to pure luck: good play is never really rewarded, except by the occasional fluke. 

The 2-player mode is probably much easier, but it is simply unacceptable to market such a product as a 1-2 pl game without testing and/or balancing it properly.

Unless, or course, they wanted the poor player to come back to it again and again thinking: âIt must be a great game, since it is so hard to win!â, and made it hard on purpose âa cheap trick (which will also probably help selling the expansionsâ¦)

If the expansions correct this, I could give them a higher rating. 
But, as it is, this box deserves a low ratingâ¦

The Good: The milieu is suberb, the art ranges between good and spectacular, the core ideas (heroes, their items, combat, questing) are fun. Two-player play is enjoyable, with interesting decisions arising from resource limitations and the different deck compositions.

The Bad: The single-player game is broken beyond belief, forcing players to deckbuild for any chance of success. And deckbuilding in this game is massively expensive. FFG should be ashamed of such poor testing.

Having the biggest love-hate relationship with this one. The LCG format and LotR theme are so fantastic. The cards are absolutely beautiful. The mechanic works quite well once it's learned. However, painfully frustrating playing solo at times. I think this is a gem at its core, though. Putting it on hold until I find someone who wants to get into it with me so we can build decks together and get some synergy going.

I enjoy it, especially the solo aspect, but for whatever reason it doesn't hit the table all that often.  Already I've got many more plays of Android:Netrunner and Star Wars: The Card Game.  Once I've played a LOTR quest, I'm not really itching to play it again, even if I failed it the first time.  I did just buy one of the Hobbit expansions, though, so maybe that will re-kindle my interest.

Took me a little while to get into this, as in some respects it's similar to Space Hulk: Death Angel, and although I like that, I've been kind of burned out on it lately.  So I wasn't really that enthused about this at first.  But the more I've played it, the more I'm getting into it.  It really has a great system and a lot of depth.  And moreso than the Space Hulk card game, it seems to have a lot more room for expansion and more replayability with new scenarios and card interactions.

Update: A rare game that I traded away, thinking I'd played it out, and then traded back for again. I'm appreciating it a lot again, especially with more quests and deck capabilities from the expansion packs.

thematic and the card AI seems like a good opponent.  cards have alot of interesting interactions.

my rating is dropping with increased play; the difficulty of the game tends to limit deck-building options and of course, you can't make a single mistake.

the game also requires you to buy alot of expansions to have any deck-building options.  compare this to Netrunner, which has a ton of gameplay with a single core set.

includes The Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock, A Journey to Rhosgobel, The Hills of Emyn Muil, The Dead Marshes, Return to Mirkwood, The Massing at Osgilliath, Khazad-dÃ»m, and The Watcher in the Water

RATING: 5
Played this for the first time, and not really sure what to think.  The concept, artwork, and idea behind it is great.  The missions/quests/scenarios feel very true to the Middle Earth world, and it is immersive in that sense.

In the game I played (4-player), the other 3 players all had pre-established decks and them made one for me to use.  Setup took a little longer than I would've liked... I imagine deck-building might be a big part of the fun for this game; to see if you can pull out the right combinations of cards to defeat the challenge at hand.

The scenario and cards we drew were rather difficult (one of us lost all of his heroes, and I would have been out due to Threat points if I didn't have Aragorn to reset it), but even having said that, we defeated the mission with only 4 Hero casualties (and, of course, many allies) out of 12 total...

And they said that was possibly the hardest game they had played.  (I heard another gamer comment that it is nearly impossible to lose)

This is a big gripe I have with games like this, especially co-op ones... the problem is that they always seem either too easy or too difficult, and it tends to have very little to do with decisions you make or preparations you plan.

PS. It does seem like it could be one of the better options available if you are alone and looking to play something solitaire. But as a multi-player game... I felt like my decisions were very mechanical and methodical (ie. it never really seemed like I had any choice but to play the way I did), and the victory felt like it was a foregone conclusion, despite the difficulty and casualties.

Yera. 

"LCG" (Living Card Game) que yo llamo mas bien EDG (Episodical Desperring Game). 

Un juego de cartas deckbuilder basado en una licencia para sacar mucho jugo, del cual salen expansiones sin tino (como con xwing y otros, ni me molesto en hacer lista de todas, necesitaria media BGG para ello, y paso. Yeray es completista. pongo "tiene todo, o esta en proceso de ello" e ya. 

La mayoria de LCGs son competitivos (1vs1, siguiendo la estela de lo que seria el magic y juegos similares), pero ESDLA LCG es cooperativo, lo que supone tres cambios importantes. 

1.- se puede jugar solo asi que es ideal para foreveraloners. tambien se puede jugar cooperativamente entre 2 e incluso entre 3 con alguna ligera modificacion. (asi es como he jugado yo dos de las 3 partidas que he jugado a esto). 

2.- al no ser competitivo, no hay "nerfs" ni "bluffs" que esten hechos ex profeso para que los jugadores tengan que seguir comprando expansiones para continuar siendo competitivos en el juego versus/torneo. 

3.- es mas susceptible de ser coleccionable que los LCG competitivos. 

el juego en si? pues es un deckbuilder bastante competente y agradable de jugar, con una muy cuidada ambientacion (aunque tiene el, emho, defectito, de que los personajes que juegas no son protagonistas de la trama, pero los que si lo son quedan bastante bien integrados en su participacion en el juego. 

Es un juego dificil (dependiendo del escenario, pero el ratio W:L raramente supera el 50-50 de victorias) pero mas agradable de jugar y no tan frustrante como otros deckbuilders, alguna que otra regla no es muy clara tal como viene escrita en la documentacion, pero despues de un par de partidas hay poco margen al discurso o queja en este apartado. 

En general es un excelente juego, pero en mi opinion es una ida de olla. el juego "completo" con todas sus expansiones, aventuras y leches, se va por encima de los 1000â¬. me da igual lo bueno que sea, lo completo que sea, lo variado que sea y lo que mole. ese dineral por un juego de cartas es una animalada, aunque traiga 100.000 cartas. 

Le recomiendo a todo el mundo probarlo. comprarlo ya es otra historia.

RATING: 2
After 20 plays solo:

Pre-game deck building can be REALLY fun. That's where the strategy is, as during gameplay there are few if any strategic decisions to be made. Lots of tactical ones, though, to mitigate the luck of the draw.

First major strike against this game is that some scenarios are just impossible to beat solo. They've got that video game feel where the player is just trying to beat the game and then it's done. Lame.

Make no mistake, this is a full blown CCG with a huge, and growing, library of cards and card combinations. The ONLY difference with LCG is that cards are not sold in random packs. As a collectible card game, there's an inherent weakness in the game design - new cards are REQUIRED to keep the game interesting. "minor" errata to existing cards are sometimes published to support the expanding universe and maintain balance in the face of power creep.

Very punishing, frustratingly low win rate even on easy mode sometimes. Very much a puzzle game in that you have to 'solve' the different scenarios by building up your deck. 

Beautiful art and story telling in Tolkien's universe is what LOTR: lcg rests entirely upon. Sadly, this is not enough to be worthy of a place on my shelf.

Just a nice quick and straightforward game to play. Only played solo though. Some scenarios rock hard with default decks so need to try some deckbuilding and possibly some new adventure packs to get some more cards.

Edit: Just can't find the time or motivation to construct decks for this so this is not getting much play. The game and theme are solid but if you aren't into the deck construction element maybe LCG's are not the games for you.

I bought this game primarily for my wife and I, as I wanted something thematic and cooperative that we could enjoy together. Although it ticks those boxes, and despite not having any outward criticisms of the game (apart from it being ridiculously difficult), this does not get much play time in our house. We tend to favour two player eurogames like Targi.

PROs
Unique gaming experience with adventure and story coming from simple cards.
Each game phase is fun: deck building and beating the encounter deck.
The missions are very different and playing a full campaign is very memorable.

CONs
You always want to test the new extensions, so it may become expensive.
Easier and more funny if not played in solo mode - except if you accept the defeat and are ready to replay several times to optimize your deck

The idea: take the mechanics of magic the gathering, a few hints of other good ideas from dead collectible card games, and smash them together into a cooperative game.  Add a very popular license and release it in a cost effective way that doesn't send recovering magic addicts running for a seven step meeting.  This isn't FFG's first LCG, but it IS their first to incorporate compelling solitaire play and a cooperative element.  Considering the current popularity of cooperative games and the CCG player's constant desire to "playtest" decks, this is a pretty smart move!  

As for the mechanics of the game, The combination of CCG like combos, hand/resource management, and the cooperative aspects is unique and very good.  Sure a lot of it is ripped off from MTG, but thats a great game only hindered by complexity and time/money investment, things absent from this game.  

After playing a couple more times, you start to see where the game shines.  Despite having several things you must be able to do each turn (quest, defend, attack) there are countless ways you could get there both in choices and also in deck construction.  In my mind, this is the game's biggest strength- not only multiple strategies to win but also multiple ways to implement each strategy.

Rated ONLY as a standalone board game, I would give this 7/10.  You can sit down with the preconstructed decks and have a very fun time as an occasionally played boardgame.  The different decks and different scenarios provide plenty of replayability for a "board game" type of experience.

One complaint I have of LOTRLCG as a board game is that it scales horribly.  Single player is insanely difficult, four player far too easy.  2 seems to be the sweet spot and 3 isn't too bad.  Cards from later expansions really work to fix this, and do a great job of it.

As a CCG/lifestyle game, I think the jury is still out.  From a competitive standpoint, the cards in the base set are not well balanced at all.  There is enough variety that several tournament builds will probably arise, however based on my CCG experience, I think the core set alone will end up yielding maybe one or two monster decks.  Of course, the expansions will either balance this out or make it worse, depending on the foresight of the designer and the level of playtesting from FFG.

UPDATE:  The expansion packs have really brought out the beauty of this game.  The additional scenarios and villains have increased replayability immensely and there are so many different types of decks available now I don't even know what to build.  Just an incredible game and deserving of its high rating on boardgamegeek.  This is the "I hate CCG" guy's CCG, the "I can't afford Magic" guy's impulse buy.  A great game.

I have everything up to and including Race Across Harad.

Fortunate to own the Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas alt arts as well as the three Fellowship event playmats.

My opinion on why this game does not rate above "9" for me: As much as I love playing this game, the concept, and the innovation seen in the quests and player card mechanisms, I believe the game is still hampered by flaws in it's original design.  

The biggest flaw in my view is the lack of framework card draw.  Other LCGs preceding and of the period this was released had a 2-card draw each round, where LOTR only got 1 per round.  If the deck minimum had been set at 30 or so this might have made sense, but with 50 cards and a game lasting maybe 10 turns on the longer end only draws you 16 cards (Opening hand of 7 plus one draw each turn).  

While this makes Lore have amazing utility, it is crippling to games with 1 or 2 players, as the top priorities in deck building will have to be combat and questing (not necessarily in that order).  This is not taking into account "jank" or trick decks that exploit a card combo.

Players will customize their decks of cards beforehand and then use them to team up against the game in this co-op CCG. I've never seen this concept before, likely because it is a bit strange. CCG players tend to enjoy the process of deckbuilding and tweaking their decks before the game to beat their opponent. In most cases they must make a well-rounded deck that can handle various types of opposing decks they will face. With this game though, before each scenario, a player knows exactly what cards he/she will face. Customizing against an "opponent" who can't respond to your changes seems almost like cheating. At the very least, being good at the deckbuilding aspect makes the actual gameplay less challenging, which is an odd dynamic. A top-tier deck in a good CCG is one that is difficult to play properly, not just to build. 

All that aside, the game itself has a few good things going for it. As a co-op should, it strongly rewards discussion and planning among the players as a group. Because each player has his/her own hand of cards, sharing information and ideas is important. There is also a strong sense in combat of dividing up the enemies so that the more combat-oriented players can take the brunt of the fights. That part feels very thematic. Because the cards played require payment, it can also create some difficult choices about how to spend your various resources. However, there is relatively little hand management in this game.

As a Tolkien fan, I love the theme of the game. The artwork on the cards is excellent. Quality of components and graphic design are also top-notch. It is clear that the designers used the books as their source material, and the tone of the art and flavor text evokes LotR the book much more than LotR the movie. 

Ultimately, this game suffers from the same problem that many other co-ops do: randomness. A favorable draw from the game deck can result in weak monsters and a cakewalk of a quest. An unfavorable one can destroy you in a matter of turns. These are outliers, to be sure. Generally, a particular quest feels about the same difficulty level each time played. But the thrill of winning due to having created a killer deck before the game (or due to this inherent randomness in the game deck) seems cheap somehow. I am willing to play this, largely because I like the theme and the feel of the game. But I recognize that I have no interest in customizing a deck to beat an opponent that doesn't exist. And by not doing so, I am really missing out on where the real "game" happens: before the game even starts.

I wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't.  I bought one set, but found you really need 2 sets of the game to start making a good deck.  Its hard to make a good deck when you only have 1 copy of many of the cards.  This is poor design on the part of FF.  If they're going to give you a card, they should give you 3 of them since many of them are needed to beat the scenarios.

LotR LCG ... an enigma of sorts. I've played it over 100 times solo, all with cards, and made a lovely progress sheet because I wanted to play it all - and got rather far in a rather short time:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FXc6V-Mg5XzPV_UIz-5rRFdB29AyCr6D2_1psmhtIBE/edit?usp=sharing

...but then I got frustrated by some unfair quests and event chains. I should have heeded the advice of more experienced players and should have played two-handed, with two sets of heroes, from rather early on. That opens up some strategies, too, when they help each other out, and actually enables some cards. And it makes it less horrible when a chain of event straight away takes out a hero after a turn or two.

It tempts me to play again. But I'd need to get into everything again, too, the rules and the cards and the strategies and everything. It's not like I have too few other solo games that I really want to play, too. So it sits unplayed for now. Even though it really is a lovely game, and an engrossing one - a play a couple could easily play for a really long time without getting bored.

Despite having a huge unfathomable rulebook, the gameplay is quite clean, it's not a case of FFG clutter at all.
 I will not play the same scenario over and over, but I will gladly pay a little to have new packs of cards, especially since these cards look really nice and that I am a bit of a Tolkien fan.
So, if you like coops and Tolkien, there is no reason not to get this.

Edit: I do not like the solo game that much, but after all I bought this game specifically for two.  I did not try to play with two hands neither).

Edit I am liking this game more and more.  Playing that with my daughter is really a hoot.  We are having discussions around our decks, we are talking a lot during games too; no alpha player here.  Last game we played was terribly tense, and even desperate - we ended the game with 46 and 44 threat, but that was amazing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played two 4-player games with a single copy of the game (we took two Threat counters from another game), and the game played rather well.  As we were all learning the cards, the games were a bit slower, but that was to be expected.

That said, I really liked the flow.  Although there are quite a few steps, they become intuitive after a game or two.

The game is interesting, cards are nice, price is acceptable, and it is not a collectable, which all add up to an 8.  Rating may change after a few more games, but I am already looking forward to the expansion(s), so we can start building our decks.

Looking forward to seeing where FFG intends to go with this.

This is an enjoyable game that my son and I enjoy playing together.  The rules are not overly complex, so it is somewhat easy to get started.  Like the rules, the game itself is not really that complex, which is nice if you are looking for a little bit lighter game.  Those who like more involved and complex games will probably not be as interested in this one.

It is really a two player Co-op game (although, you can play solo, too).  The game comes with 4 different hero factions -- each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  It also comes with 3 quests (scenarios) -- although one of the scenarios is extremely difficult to win.  These scenarios determine which enemies and challenges will be included in the encounter (enemy) deck.

There is some variety in the base game, but really, we found that we needed an expansion deck after only a few plays.  This is my first exposure to a game like this, so I discovered that this is the way these deck building games work.  Nevertheless, I found this fact to be a little disappointing, as I am used to base games to go much longer before the need for an expansion.

Essentially, if you like lighter two player co-ops (perhaps light to medium), and you are okay investing in future decks, this is a game that you will probably enjoy.

UPDATE:  Upped the rating to a 10.  This has been the game my son and I have played the most for the last couple of years.

Hugely expandable, requires money. Apparently fun in solo play, though I can't "make" myself spend the time to set it up for solo play.

Deck building is fun and the mechanics overall interesting. 

Surge events on encounter cards are the stupidest thing in this game. They turn the game from 'I lost because I played poorly' to 'I lost because I drew crappy encounter cards that added even more encounter cards that added even more...'. Luck is NOT the way to add primary difficulty to games in the modern day.

Luckily, some scenarios come with less surge event cards, and those are relatively fun going, and while the luck factor is still there, at least you keep drawing a steady number of cards.

Good solo play, but works much better and is more interesting as a cooperative (we tried 2-player). Trying the first scenario for a few sessions to iron-out the rules and see what kind of problems we encounter.  

The second scenario is a blast.  The game is difficult, but it is part of the fun.  You are constantly trying to tweak your decks to defeat the scenario.  Each game plays out slightly different due to randomness of the encounter deck, which is very good thing.  There is tension and tough decisions to be made almost throughout the entire game.  Each turn, you wish you had more resources, more characters, more will/attack/defense.  So many things to do and not enough time to do them all.  The threat mechanic is great and forces you to really push forward. 

I bought all the expansions currently available after a few games with the core set.  Great replayability and theme.

Sold off. Still think it's a great and unique game, but too expensive for what it is, and I started finding building different decks for different quests a little tedious given the limited time I have for playing.

Parting with the game was bittersweet. I have great memories from it, but am glad I won't be spending any more money on FFG/Asmodee. Good riddance.

---

Rating based on Core game plus the first six saga boxes, plus the first five cycles. 

The Core set only is perhaps a solid 7. Core + Shadows of Mirkwood is an 8. Core + SoM + Dwarrowdelf = 9. Or something like that.

---

A very addictive solo/coop deckbuilder that has grown on me. The one caveat is that because of the relatively large role chance can play in a single game, it's a little bit like doing research -- you have to do an experiment (a player deck/heroes/adventure configuration) several times to get a good feel for what works and what doesn't. 

On the question of chance, you have Treachery card effects and Shadow effects that can be quite dramatic and reduce your chance of winning significantly in a single draw. Configurations of the Encounter deck that result in an unmanageable flood of enemies are also possible. On the other hand, most cards are not Treachery cards and don't have Shadow effects, so the outcomes vary between the very good and very bad, with fewer in-betweens. The result is that a single play session is not guaranteed to be very rewarding.

This swinginess is definitely more the case the fewer cards you have to choose from for your player deck. Once you've gotten some expansions and have a larger card pool to choose from, you'll find ways of managing this high uncertainty of outcomes. Indeed, this is one thing that gives the game depth and makes it fun -- the cards allow you to change the playing experience dramatically. The different spheres play differently and allow different strategies for achieving victory. Even then, the beginning of the game can be very important. Someone on the forums had said that whether you win or lose can depend in large part on the first 5 or so cards in the encounter deck, and I think that is largely true.

LotR LCG is also more a strategic game than a tactical one. It makes more of a difference how you construct your deck than how you actually play it, and this also means that you have to spend time "metagaming" and experimenting with different combinations of cards. Granted, the tactical element is there, and there are many meaningful decisions to be made during play. In this regard, the game is much better than Dominion, for example, where there is almost no thought involved in playing your hand. The metagaming component can be viewed as both a positive and a negative feature of the game, since it gives it longevity, but requires persistence and many plays, and usually you have to do some work before jumping into a quest.

The gameplay isn't as deep and rewarding as some other recent coops such as Mage Knight, but then again, a session of LotR LCG is several times shorter and you have the metagaming aspect. I also think the designers could better use the opportunities for narrative that the mechanics of the game and the distribution model allow.

These gripes aside, this is a very solid game, whether you are a fan of the LotR setting or not (I wouldn't call myself a fan, but I appreciate the richness of the world and some of the themes). I keep returning to the game and thinking about it, so my rating has grown with time from a measly starting 7.

Definitely more fun with a larger card pool to choose from and more adventures.

RATING: 7.5
So far I have only played solo; using both one-deck and two-deck (i.e. as if two players) styles. I much more enjoy using the two deck approach as it allows more card interaction (and can be slightly easier). For me, the game provides tense fun and I like to follow the 'story' it tells as I progress through the quest. I can only imagine that a two-player game would only increase this game's experience.

Update: Nearly two months later and I've downgraded this game from 8.5 to 7.5. I still enjoy the game but after playing it numerous times, some of it's shortcomings (to me) have been revealed.

Score based only on introductory scenario. I appreciate that the first scenario's difficulty was set so we could win easily, since we could focus on learning the mechanics rather than worrying about strategy. Disappointed that there are only 3 scenarios in the box, but I'll have to play them. Perhaps the other two are hard enough that I'll have to spend time deckbuilding to succeed, which is a game in and of itself!

Played through the core set scenarios. Beat the 2nd scenario with 2 players on the first try, but one player was eliminated. We've lost the 3rd scenario twice so far, and I think we'll have to deck build to beat it. We really like this game, and I especially appreciate that it seems to have captured my SO's interest :)

 The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game was my big surprise of summer 2011, mainly I like the story-telling aspect (we never look at the cards before play - not at the players deck, the encounter deck nor the adventure cards themselves - we just played it as an adventure with many bad - and good - surprises!). 
And I like the pure co-op aspect with finally no traitor or whatever mechanism to "spice" it up. So may it be a "Living Cardgame" and a money-sink, I'll also buy the next expansion.

The Lord of the Rings: LCG, what can I say? Aside from War of the Ring, this game does a pretty good job of grabbing you in its theme & lore and making you feel like you're going on unique adventures with tons of varied heroes at your disposal and tough challenges and frightening enemies to tackle. That is of course if you're willing to shell out some good amount of cash for the game. One Core set is sadly not enough to really get into the meat this game has to offer, which is customizing and building your unique deck to face the dangers the game throws at you. The game can be quite punishing with what's included in one box.

This game's difficulty is not "unforgiving" per se. It is actually very tolerable to a point. But sometimes it can become unnecessarily hard. I have been able to beat many of the scenarios, but the literally speed ramp up in difficulty from one scenario to the next can be unforgiving and God-awfully swing-y at times. Some Enemies can utterly destroy one or more of your heroes if you're not careful and your threat meter escalates at an alarming rate. Not to mention enemies attack first and may get bonus annoying effects. But in the grand scope of things, being able to overcome this obstacles and beating a scenario feels like a great accomplishment. Not to mention you got through the game with a deck you created. Gives you a great feeling. On the flip side, if you get destroyed, you may want to tweak or total re-do your deck which can also be quite the fun endeavor, patching up the weaknesses you noticed while playing.

I've played both solo, two and three player. It works really good with either, but best at two. Some scenarios are literal "hell on earth" in solo while sometimes, a three player game will feel like a cakewalk. Hence why two is the best player count for this game

My main gripe with this game, and my gripe with any LCG type game is the game is addicting and you're pretty much going to pay if you want to improve your decks beyond what 2 or even 3 core sets can offer. 2 Core sets, 1 Deluxe expansion and all its cycle packs will run you about $180(less with deals, buying online etc.) You'll get a lot of play and customize options, as well as some unique quests that feel different than each. There are big box sets per LOTR movie (So that's 8, including The Hobbit) and then the Saga big box expansions, each of which has 6 cycle deck each. Granted you can buy and expand at your own pace. There is no point going full throttle, because scenarios are easily replay-able and you can slowly acquire expansions that suit your needs. Each expansion adds a unique new keyword, mechanic etc. If you like it, buy it and it's cycle decks, if not simply skip and move to the next. Also one of the best ways to help with costs, is find a friend or two, teach them the game, and if they really like it they can help with expanding the game with you to take away some of the costs. And of course like any LCG, there is no collectability aspect to the game, so you want need to spend about 60 dollars on a playset of one card, but 60 dollars to get a good pile of cards enough to make 2, maybe 3 decks :)

Overall the game is fun, even more so if you got a person or two to enjoy it with. I

Great coop game. Easy set up, lots of variety, and very expandable. Cons are the rules are pretty heavy and will take awhile to get down, and personally I don't feel compelled to play the same scenario again after beating it, which kind of forces me into "spend a ton of money to keep this game fun" territory which I don't like.

Solid, cooperative LCG with interesting mechanics.  Unfortunately, games are mostly decided not by skill, but rather by the random card flops from the Encounter Deck.  Good flops mean you win, and bad flops mean you lose (often first or second turn).  Also, target building a deck for each different scenario gets tiresome.

-- 5-28-2011 --

After a few solo games (2 losses and 1 win) to get my mind around things, I'm only ok on the game. The hero mechanic isn't my favorite, but I've felt the same about my limited exposure to games like Marvel Vs. and the WoW CCG. With my limited experience, it seems like it will be really hard to make a usable multi-sphere deck out of just one core set. We'll see how the expansions and more experience change that.

I'm really hoping to up my rating on this one with a few more plays. If I can get my wife into it, that will probably bump the rating up a bit too. It did seem like it would be better with at least 2 players.

-- 7-10-2011 --

After some deck customization, a couple games with my wife, and one solo attempt at the second scenario, I've dropped my rating from 6 to 4. This game is just... no. It's so horribly dry that I don't feel the theme at all. Maybe (big maybe) a few more plays would let the mechanics flow more easily, allowing the theme to shine through, but I have to force myself to play trying to get to that point. It's just not even the tiniest shred of fun for me. Le sad.

I tried the core set with my wife. We complated the 1st scenario with not-mixed decks and tried 2nd scenario - didn't succeeded.

I understand that LCG is all about deck building, but still LotR is more like a solitire. The lack of opponent puts this game somewhere close to Pandemic. The only difference is that in LotR you need to find a solution before the game - by building the deck.

This game is HARD! But allows for a lot more stategy - the random element is with the cards you draw into your hand, so allows a lot more tactical manipulation than I found with Arkham Horror LCG, where the output randomiser was too unforgiving (to my mind). If I lose in this game, most of the time I have felt it is because I have made a bad decision somewhere, rather than just because of bad luck.

RATING: 7
There's very likely fun to be had in this game, but I wasn't able to find it readily. The components are beautiful, and the rendering of theme is excellent--but I just couldn't get the flow of the game, and taking turns just seemed like a chore. I had no particular investment in the adventure, and the drama escaped me. 

Some caveats--I like the concept of deckbuilding, but most often get bored when it comes time to the actual mechanics. Also, I got this as a solo game, and only played it as such. There may well be more to it when playing with other people. 

I may give this a go again some time in the future--but for now, happy to let this one go.

Love the implementation of theme, mechanics, varied quests, replayability and opportunities for strategy.  Much more engrossing than I'd expect from a card game.  I was not expecting to enjoy the deck building as much as I do.  Does a much better job in play conveying the sense of going on an adventure than I would have expected just reading the rules.  Can be brutal and random but given the length of the game it doesn't bother me.

final thoughts:
This game is too hard for solo. With two players, it is passable, but still hard, and doesn't feel like you have many choises - whatever you do, you didn't have other choises.
Even during dackbuilding, the Core set doesn't really give you freedom. Even worse - you'll have to add card you probably won't be able to use, just because there are not enough in the set.

I have had this for a while.  At first I thought that it was too easy based on the first mission.  So I didn't play it for some time.  

Then I thought that the 2nd mission was impossible so I didn't play it for some time.

Now I am back.  And I have to say that I am starting to really enjoy it.  Before I just used the standard decks and thought that the game was poorly balanced.  However, I have now started using mixed decks with some attempt at deck building by eliminating those cards that never help.  I am now tempted to start buying expansions or whatever they call the additional cards.  It is very confusing to a beginner though.  I have no idea what to buy and they have different names for the additional cards:  Expansions, Adventure Packs, Cycles, Saga Expansions.  I am lost!!!!

Have had fun with the first few learning games.  In subsequent games we have attempted deck-building against the second scenario, and had a very hard time, becoming frustrated.  Looks like, with only one base set, we shouldn't attempt to build full 50 card tournament decks, but keep them smaller.

Deckbuilding has improved by not following the 50card deck rule - we have 40-43 cards in the deck.  Finally got our first win on Journey Down the Anduin - very happy about that!

Having a resurgence of interest after playing with Russell & Ray.  Doing custom deckbuilding with Tina.  Really enjoying it again!

Received two additional core sets in July 2012 "Priorities" math trade.

Getting a few steady plays in with Tina, and doing a bit of soloing.

I've got some mixed feelings about this one currently.  I really love it, but it's not such a great fit for the amount of time and frequency that Tina and I currently have to game.  It's very rewarding to modify a deck until it is successful against a specific quest.  However, in most instances we don't have time to play a quest multiple times, so often we end after getting beat up by a quest, and have to try and remember how we should modify the deck at a later date.  Games that are more rewarding for once-in-a-while play, like Pandemic, may be a better fit for our evening gaming, even if I technically like Lord of the Rings LCG better.

Playing once in a while by planning ahead and having our decks ready, and it's going well.  I just designed a pair of dwarf decks that we will start from the beginning and work through the quests with.

Current style of playing in summer 2013: pick a quest, then design a deck specifically for the quest.  Since each quest is so different, it can be frustrating to just build a deck and throw it against any quest, even though that's initially how we hoped to play.

Fall 2013, started the Hobbit Saga quests with Dwarf decks.  Thematic to the max.

Nov. 13, 2013 - first hobbit box completed.  Fun quests.  More deck adjustments required between quests than we might like, but it's rewarding to defeat a quest after first losing.

Mar. 21, 2016 - Just sold the collection via LotR:LCG subreddit.  Enjoyed our time with the game, but it just was never getting to the table any longer.  Probably don't need to get sucked down the rabbit hole of buying LCG's ever again, as my collection has thousands of plays available just in standard games, without "subscribing" to games for which expansions are necessary.

I played this game some time ago and I have a kind of mixed emotions about it. I do think that the game has some very good points, like the idea of being involved in a mission and having different way of wining, the artwork is amazing, but it just doesn't feel like a fun game. The rating that I give to this game is more related to how I approach games in general that maybe with this game itself. From my experience, and taking into account how difficult this game is, in order to have success in this game, you need to prepare the deck very carefully, you need to have under control every aspect of the mission that you are playing and then the cards that you draw, and the enemies cards, need to be balanced for the players. Many times you have the feeling that the mission have been prepared that difficult to be played in a tournament or something like that, where the players need to replay the mission many times until having the perfect deck and knowing how to be successful. I think that there will be plenty of players interested in that kind of approach, which is fine, I do not have any problem, but my way of playing board games is just playing a game and trying to win with what I have around or defeating my friends or whatever, but not doing a study and many deck configurations and trying over and over and over again until being in a position where wining is possible.
I have played the game with generic decks, balanced, but not particularly prepared for a certain mission, and it all depends on what cards do you draw as starting hand. And then there are some missions absolutely independent on that. You are going to lose no matter what
Positive:
1. The game concept is very good
2. Artwork
3. Many missions available
Negative:
1. You have to do a study and a deck preparation before every mission if you want to have success
2. Not fun to play when you now that you are going to lose no matter what

As I see it the difficulty levels stated by FFG apply to 2-player games.

Got this played finally. First thing you notice is there should have been more cards, too many are repeated like spiders, locations, etc. and deckbuilding is hardly viable with the low count of player cards they gave, loses points for this. 

Pretty straightforward play but still gives us some decisions to make, probably more than Pandemic anyway thus I like it a little more. I like the theme of course and it comes out pretty good here overall.  Luck will be a factor but like I mentioned in a system like this probably always will, at least there are no dice.  Will try and post more thoughts after another game.


------- Preplay thoughts

Crap another LOTR game, they have to stop damn it! Please please please let them get this one right...

Edit - Hmm it sounds pretty good overall, likely a 7.5 or 8 for me from all the info I have. It mostly all sounds good, seems to have decisions to make more so than some others you could compare, luck is the sticky point but with this kind of system I'm not sure how you could ever lower it. I'm not crazy about the co-op format either like many however I already own a great 1vs1 LOTR card game in ME:CCG so do I really need another?  Probably not so in a way this is kind of good and maybe it can be easily adapted for 1vs1 as well. I do already own a good LOTR co-op game though, which with exp can be played 1vs1, heh, some overlap dang I just can't resist a decent game with this theme...

I [i]never[/i] play solo games ever but might be tempted with this one, largely due to my love of the theme of course.

Love the game, although the time it takes to construct decks properly and tweak them to complete different quests keeps it from being a 10. I do enjoy that I can design and build decks here and there when I don't have time to actually sit and play a game, but I am also often daunted by the prospect of resorting the cards and building new decks in order to move on to another quest.

The gameplay itself it tight, thematic, challenging, and exciting. The risk/reward element of the game is fantastically balanced and only dampened by the fact that for many quests you HAVE to know the makeup of the encounter deck in order to properly weigh the risk of certain plays. For example, on one quest I took three heroes that all had 2 hit points and the quest had a card that dealt two damage to each exhausted character. Since I had just quested with each hero, they all died in one go on turn 2. It was a little disheartening to deconstruct the deck I had made and was excited to try just to attempt the quest I was on (I was trying to play the quests in order at that point). It's a fun challenge to check out a quest deck and parse out what sort of deck you need to build to defeat and then see how successful you were at deciphering the needs of the quest, but it can also be a big deterrent to actually sitting down and playing.

This game does alot of things right, but it can be very irritating to loose to bad card draw from your own deck and/or the encounter deck, which unfortunately despite how much I like the rest of the game, this kind of kills the it for me.

Also requires a lot of deckbuilding/tweaking in between each scenario, so much that as much time is spent tweaking decks as is spent playing (this is good for some, bad for others).

I feel bad rating it so low, since at first I had a lot of fun with the game, but it's just too frustrating to play, and there are other better games out there now that while they don't have the extensive deckbuilding of this game, they are much more fun to play (Mage Knight, Warhammer Quest: ACG).

RATING: 10
This is my most-played cooperative game thus far.  I liked playing it with incremental card gains, acting like I didn't own any newer sets (even though I bought them all up front).  I also play it solo now and then, but I prefer having a partner.  Sadly, my wife isn't into the TCG/LCG kind of game and my TCG partner hasn't been around much anymore, so this is stuck on my shelf for now.

My one major complaint about the game, at least back when I bought it (maybe they changed it?), is that the base set didn't have three of every card!  Their ploy worked on me (I bought 3 of the base set) but man it still makes me mad thinking about it even to this day.

2017-12-28: Played again this Christmas.  Man, I think I will always love this game, rating up from 9 to 10.

Really cool.  I was ready to play again after the first play, but it was the end of the night.  We'll see how it holds up.  The set I played had expansion cards in it, but I don't know which is which.  Obviously, that might affect my opinion.

RATING: 9
I hesitated to buy this as the previous LCG I bought, Warhammer Invasion, really doesn't get much play and I wasn't too happy about cherry-picking expansion decks to get better cards. However, I'm really glad I came off the fence for this one, hooked really by the theme. With it being a coop, it doesn't feel like you need the 'best' cards, you can have fun exploring how cards from the different player and encounter decks come together. And the scope for this is huge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think the LCG concept for a coop/solo game is genius, truly. The gameplay is also engaging, addictive and not too complicated. One thing that I think is a little off in this game is the balance with each number of players. It definitely becomes easier the greatest number of players you have.

I also have a tinge of regret that FFG did not choose another theme for this game. Don't mistake me, I absolutely love everything LOTR, but I already have many games with this theme and there are so many other cool themes left unexplored in games!

Anyway, I'm hooked and look forward to the expansion packs!

***UPDATE***
I feel the game is getting old playing with the same few decks and does not have the staying power of most coops, so I'm lowering my rating from 9 to 8. However, this is likely due to the slow release of the adventure packs.

When I heard about the release of the Star Wars LCG, my dedication to this game was shaken. I'll really have to play both before deciding which one to I will truly invest in.

***UPDATE***
The game seems strangely empty and hasn't been able to hold my interest. Sad. Down to 6.

This is an interesting deck building cooperative card game, I enjoy the solo play (so far only played the core game quests).

The Pathfinder Card is more of a card game RPG, which is what I prefer.

2013-11-20

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2012)

Itâs been awhile since I played this. To be perfectly honest I was expecting a lot better BUT the friend who explained it to me made a lot of mistakes and I didnât  understood the game very well. We also played a 3 player game. Today I will insist in a two player game. At the time I was careless about my ratings so I gave it a 7.0 (today I would have given it a 5.0) However I have recently played a lot of Pathfinder and I really like the game AND I love every LCG I have played (so far Android Netrunner and Star Wars LCG) so I think I will like LOTR LCG. I will give this another chance with the correct set of rules. 

For now Iâm downgrading its rating to the one I should have given it a long time ago, but Iâm keen on trying this soon. The components are great as usual from FFG. The art is ok.

Current Rating: 5.0

Very tentative rating.  I need a few more plays to firm it up and I'm not sure when I will get them.

I like that there are numerous decision points for each player which seems to solve the problem of one player dominating a coop game.  I also like the multitude of available scenarios different in both theme and gameplay.

I didn't build a deck for my single play but if the deckbuilding is as captivating as others say that could push this title higher for me.  The issue is time - this game deserves to be played 10-20 times at least and it will take a long while for me to build up that many plays.

First impression is that this is an excellent game with lots of potential when the expansions arrive.  I usually like the idea of solo play more than the actual play, but this game has managed to capture my attention more than any so far.  I think playing "solo" with two sets of heroes is more interesting.  

Had a chance to try co-op and I liked it better than solo.  It will be interesting to see how the deck-building goes.

This is one of my most difficult game for deciding whether to buy or not. It has great theme, cooperative nature and simple mechanics, though we still play it wrongly during our first two trial play sessions. After the test plays, we realized how tough it was to complete the quests or beat the game, but still remain excited about it. Will update again after a few sessions of plays without errors. This game has enormous amount of potential and can't wait to experience the adventuring feel when playing it. 

[Update] 4th December 2013: after 18 solo sessions and four learning 2-player sessions, this game simply amazes me in many ways. It's definitely very hard in solo mode, and even though all ended in loss, i still enjoyed it, though with a little bit of frustration. It seems to me there is no way to beat the scenario 2 (i'm currently at) with just the base set. I am focusing on Tactics mix with Lore. As for 2-player games, it was really great! Will update again after more games. No regret of getting this game so far. Improved rating from 8 to 9, will see if it will come to 10, which is essentially my favorite game.

For every tight tense nail biter you can have a dozen games where you will get absolutely trounced or as I found have the odd game which is a cakewalk. Core game definately feels the need to tweak with the decks you are given. To make it worse that is only on the first difficulty quest making this very difficult to rate.  As it could fall anywhere as a 1 rating or an 8 rating.

I feel I need to put in some serious time to develop a deck that will actually work but until I spend the hours doing that I rate this a 1.

As a former Revised/Ice Age/4th Magic player, the concept of LCG scared me. Netrunner is amazing but I didn't have a solid play group so away it went as playing the same person didn't allow us to fully experience the asymmetrical meta it provides.

Lord of the Rings is fantastic for exploring with a second person as the deck tinkering is discussed between both players because of the cooperative nature of the game.

The quest mechanics are thematic. The four different player factions have their focus which allows very fun deck interactions. And if the players conspire, powerful decks can be made to complement each other. Fantastic!

This game has a very easily attainable immersion to the theme which is to my experience amazingly hard for this sort of card game!

After our first 5 sessions w 3 single sphere players I'm very pleased for what I had purchased. We stumbled upon many little problems, like we had to put all our heroes to the quest and still our threat rose. This happened because we didn't understand the meaning of Staging Area, we just added the threats from every enemy (engaged or not) and location (except the one where we traveled before). So there is still a lot to learn about effectible cooperation!

For more indepth thoughts I have to play a bit more :)

I would love to trade this away as I feel the game lacks depth when compared to MTG. I like the LCG concept and love that I could build powerful decks, but the game lacked a challenge element if you were good at deckbrewing and deckbuilding. It felt very easy and straightforward. the challenges just weren't that challenging and most of the time if I struggled, it wasn't because I was "searching for a puzzle piece," it was because I just didn't draw well. 

It would be amazing for a younger nerdy kid that likes MTG and wants to have a co-op game with a friend but isn't quite competitive in MTG nor does he have the budget for it. :)

My initial impression of this game wasn't positive, but after revisiting it a few years later, I found it had a certain appeal. Part of this is admittedly how much my son likes it, but it has enough merits for me to enjoy with other adults.

Great game.  I've played solo and multi-player up to 4 players, all with one Core set.  It plays fine, though 4-players through the second scenario was very doable both times we played it.

I'm not a Magic player and I've never played more than a handful of any other CCG/LCG, so I was unsure of whether or not I would like this.  I love it, and I've played it 14 times in the last 2.5 weeks, so that's saying a lot.

I like the game system and the game play.  There are interesting, non-trivial decisions to make almost every turn, and nothing is guaranteed in this game (the last time I played we lost ~8 allies and 2 heroes in a 4P game just while setting up the last stage of the second scenario).  I really like the way the spheres work together.

I've not done any deck-building yet, and I don't know that I'll be doing that much of it in the long haul.  I' simply enjoying the game as it is.

There are only 2 criticisms I can make against the game:

1. Nothing in the game evokes Middle Earth or the Lord of the Rings for me.  Yes, there are cards named Aragorn and Gimli and what not, but it just doesn't do it for me.  This could just as easily have been a Zombie-pocalypse game.  But I'm a hard-core Tolkien fan-boy, so I knew going in that it had little chance of holding up for me in this regard.

2. With a game like this one, careful wording of the cards is a must.  Terminology should be chosen and adhered to diligently, and I just don't feel they did that here.  This is especially disappointing considering how many LCGs they have in flight at the moment; you'd think they'd have figured it out by now.

Overall, it's a great game.  Go watch the video tutorials and if it looks at all interesting, go grab a copy!

I was looking for a good solo challenge, and I found it. The core set offers some nice opportunities for customizing your deck(s). While there are plenty of great quests available online for free, I still think the base game should come with more than three. Anywho, I don't have the least bit of interest in the Lord of the Rings, and I'm still having fun getting smacked around by this game.

I love Lord of the Rings and I love Magic. Combining two things I love equals great things.

I am a huge LotR fan.  Huge.

The fact that I just could not get around the mathy, weakly-themed mechanics of this deck-builder is a personal tragedy for me.  I wanted to like it so badly.  I purchased multiple expansions to see if that would help, but ultimately, I could not get past the feeling of being bored while playing it.  I am certain that someone will enjoy it more than I will.  :(

I've sleeved all the hero cards in FFG premium limited ed. LotR art card sleeves (The same One Ring design that is on the backs of them).  

Update (10/16):  After a few years of gaming under my belt, I am determined to give this another go, and perhaps a more fair shake with regards to my expectations of it.  

I have purchased the core set and a bunch of the Saga exps., which (after some research) I understand to be more fun and thematic,. and which don't require as much of the fiddling with your deck that the other expansion cycles do.  

Still, my hope is that making it fun for me and learning the game better before introducing the tougher scenarios and deck building elements will foment a greater appreciation for this entire game.

Fantastic, and dripping in theme. A warning however: You need to deck build, and expect to lose a lot. The goal is to deck build, tweak your deck between plays, and enjoy the metagame all to get your best deck design and best gameplay methods out there to face the quest...which you still will probably lose. This is a game where you can do everything right and still will lose more often than not. The idea is to make sure you do everything right so you can take advantage of those times lady luck will make it *possible* for you to win.

26/04/15 - Pretty ordinary first solo game with the mono Lore deck. Within two or three turns I was drawing locations non-stop until my threat just got hammered to bits. I guess I'm missing something.

05/05/15 - FAIRLY SURE I just beat Mirkwood.

06/05/15 - Got to Stage 2 of Anduin.

09/05/15 - Still struggling up the Anduin.

09/05/15 - (Second game) Beat Anduin! Final enemy was Chief Ufthak and got smashed to pieces by my ten allies (and an easy Sneak Attack by Beorn if it had been required). Final threat: 20.

12/05/15 - Haven't been able to replicate my success with Anduin, but have gotten close a few times. Need to rethink the deck I guess. Not that I know what any of it does.

14/05/15 - Beat Journey Along the Anduin for the second time. Getting there!

18/05/15 - First attempt at Dol Guldur - ouch.

Should never believe the hype. Boring, obvious choices, nothing new, and it seems FFG has decided to milk the Lord of the Rings theme for all its worth.  I am simply shocked that anyone would rate this beyond a 5 or 6.  A 13 page faq is a sign of a "great" game?

I'd heard how hard this game was, but ours was easy.  I'd probably need to credit that to the demo scenario chosen.

The game mechanics are solid and engaging. I'm not a huge LOTR fan but I did enjoy the movies. I enjoy the theme and I think it works well enough with the mechanics. Die hard fans who care about details will probably be annoyed at some of the thematic stuff, but I don't care that much. The art and general atmosphere are appealing to me.

The game flows well and there are lots of hard decisions to make. Characters must be tapped in three separate phases and generally can only participate in one, being unavailable until the next round when untapped. They can advance the scenario which is the real objective, they can be used to defend against enemies, or they can be used to attack. Note they can not defend and attack. Figuring out which characters will do what each round is the bulk of the decision making. On top of that you have a hand of cards some of which you can play in a given turn using resources collected each round by your heroes. Managing your hand and the special abilities of the cards you have in play round out decision space.

The game is hard! At least there exist many scenarios with varying difficulty levels. Some decks might be more-or-less suited to a particular scenario. Co-op games need to be hard, otherwise they're no fun. You should never have an easy time of things and it seems that the win-to-loss ratio in the game favors the loss side which is good.

The final element that I haven't explored too much yet, but that I'm very excited about is deck construction. I haven't put decks together since MTG! I never felt the need to do it in Blue Moon, but this game is screaming for custom decks. I think playing solo makes the need for deck building even stronger so I'm really looking forward to exploring options.

The game certainly has luck which seems to be the main complaint of detractors. I don't think that argument makes a lot of sense though. Co-op games with an automated response need to rely on random elements if they want to keep information hidden from the players. Pandemic has this same "problem" but I don't think people complain about it as much in that case. A card game with a shuffled deck will also have this issue to varying degrees. Since this game has deck construction bad card draws can at least be influenced directly by the player.

LotR: The Card Game was my first dip of the small toe into LCG (or CCG as well) waters. I only played the first quest with the preset decks but a bit surprisingly I enjoyed it and would like to play again. It helped that it is cooperative as the usual tug-of-war of collecting card games doesn't sound appealing at all. Another advantage is its solitaire feasibility which at least gives it a theoretical chance that I might start building decks which is an unsurmountable barrier in terms of necessary up front investment for a two-player game where both players need to have the game and time.

I'm still trying to find out how I like this one. I've heard people say they like it solo, but the game forces you to build your deck to play alone or play two hands from the start. I think that two hands are an awful lot to manage (I'm still not into the game enough to break up the heroes from their core decks and build a deck for solo play). I like the flavor text from the actual novels on the cards. The mechanics work well, and the art is great. I just have a hard time playing it solo, and that's the reason I got the game. It's a really advanced game, and I wish I'd known what I was getting into before I bought the game. I wish they had like a stepping stone game or set up (kind of like Seasons has you start with the same cards before you start playing games with drafting; I'm sure there's stuff online, but I'm worried I'll find out so much that it ruins the game for me, like relying too much on a walkthrough to beat a video game). I feel like this game is overwhelming and can feel fiddly. But it also somehow feels less like fan fiction (Eldritch Horror) and more like one of the lost tales that Tolkien left unpublished. Kudos for that, and it's the reason for the high rating despite the flaws.

Update after 6 months with the game:  I'm hooked. It's my personal favorite game. I've cracked into the preconstructed deck building world, but it's because I'm excited to see where the game will take me. Feels like the books in all the right ways. I'm so happy for the LCg model. It's like an hbo series in a way.

Update again: great game, but I seem to end up net-decking, which defeats the whole purpose of deck construction. What do I play this for after all? It's a great game but I'm not so sure where I stand with it.

Took a while to buy this game but finally got it for my birthday. Wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. However, I love it! It's quite hard to start with but you get used to what you need to do with your heroes very quickly.
Given that I've posted a session report (and I've never done that before), I'm really enjoying this game. Great to sit down with at the table when the family is watching TV or such and play out a scenario or two.
The scenarios are what keep it interesting. With only 3 in the box and 1 each expansion it needs lots more scenarios. Otherwise, I'd rate this a 10.
3 Jan 13 - Not getting it out much these days but still like it.
Nov 16 - Have rediscovered this game. Getting into deck building and tuning with two spheres. Fun. Go to Beorn's Path for help on deck building. Still need new scenarios though. It is text heavy to read and fiddly. So don't know how long I'll keep going with it but enjoying again so far.

One of my favorite games that I own. I love building decks and running through the many quests that this game has to offer. It works perfectly with the Lord of the Rings theme of having a small group of heroes traveling around middle earth and running into all kinds of enemies and misfortune. Also, the solo/coop nature of the game is great for me if my wife isn't in the mood for board games.

RATING: 8
A great cooperative concept with a good amount of depth and strategy. Out of the box, it struggles in the area of card distribution (with 1 or 2 copies of some of the best cards, encouraging you to buy a second core set which comes with a lot of waste). Scenarios range from casual fun to extreme difficulty, meaning my casually playing family does not enjoy the full range of the game together. The potential for a great game is there and will hopefully get flushed out with the expansions.

For being a card game I would hard pressed to describe just how great of a job TLotR: TCG does immersing you into the world of middle earth. A great game solo but best with two, the depth of customization and story telling in second to none. The primary drawback being that amassing a decent collection takes some serious $. 

I love trying out new hero combinations and tackling new and old quests alike. I recommend solo be played two handed (not ever a problem for me with any game) as the interaction between players really makes the game shine. More often than not I am playing this with my wife or with my good friend who also has an excellent collection.

Chalk this up as another victim of my un-enthusiasm for solo gaming.  The quests were very difficult when using the base sets (too hard to allocate to both the quests and fights) and I simply did not want to invest the time to deck build.  Theme and play did not match my group either and a single two player game didn't impress me either.  I also wasn't thrilled with the idea of continuously pumping money into expansion pack after expansion pack.

RATING: 6
This game hates me and so far I hate it.  I realize I have few plays, but those plays its been an awful, frustrating, annoying experience. I certainly dont mind losing a game - see Space Hulk Death Angel/D-Day at Omaha Beach when I can see some light at the end of the tunnel.  This just kicks your ass then pisses on your face just for the fun of it.  It literally hates the player.  

I bought this for solo play, maybe coop is better, I dont know and Im running out of patience to find out.  

I would venture to guess this game is better than being punched in the sack with brass knuckles, but its about as much fun.

EDIT 04/26/11 - played with a different pre-set deck and had a much better experience.  Re-rated to a 6, and will continue re-rating as I play more.  Going to play the rest of the pre made decks, then construct my own.

EDIT 04/29/11 - Starting to like this game, starting to see and understand how it works.  Beat the first quest with Spirit deck this evening with a final score of 31.  Looking forward to trying other decks and building my own.

I bought this game so I would have something to legitimately play single player.  Based off of some BGG lists I came across it was ranked very high for single player play throughs.  I enjoyed the first play through and got wrecked by the game.  This is something I actually enjoy because most games just aren't that difficult.  My problem became only being able to win based on luck, or if you invested more money into the game.  If I am going to love a game, you need to be able to beat it consistently with skillful play with some randomness.  Not get beat by card draw, in a single player game.  The theme is fantastic.  **Small Spoiler** The first mission is literally walking down a road, which I thought was fantastic and very faithful to the theme of the game.  I love the deck building mechanics and how they all can work together, but I don't like needing to buy 4 base sets of the game to have the "best" starting deck.  This may be the first game that I give up.

RATING: 8
I'm quite enjoying the game so far, but I'm fighting frustration with the decks I've assembled. Building a strong and efficient deck has never been a skill that I've been proficient at, and competing against a preconstructed enemy deck really requires you to have a strong strategy. I've bought a lot of expansions, but I need to actually study the cards to learn what they do.

Although I have heard this game referred to as a "puzzle" instead of a game, I appreciate the way they managed to meld the theme with extremely clean mechanics. It should be noted that this is not the kind of co-op game you want to play if you have someone in the group who isn't a team player or the game will just pummel you into goo. I'm working on acquiring all expansions except the nightmare decks, and will get those eventually.

Epic, EPIC game. However, I feel like playing this game seriously (as in trying to win each scenario in order) requires a lot of time dedication, as I feel the best way to play is to make a general deck, try a new scenario, get stomped, then figure out how to beat it after a couple of failures. Huge replayability. Scenarios are wildly different

Played this one quite a bit now and I have to say that I do enjoy it.  It plays well as a 2 player game and is interesting solo.  

It's biggest problems are it's player scaling (gets much easier the more people playing), and the fact that it is an LCG.  Not as annoying as a CCG model to be sure, but still danged irritating in many ways and nothing more than a huge money sink (like the fact that you need multiple core sets to really have any "deckbuilding" options :gulp: )

(*Update* My interest in this is starting to slip and I'm considering selling it.  It seems as though without large numbers of expansions the game will rapidly grow stale, and it suffers from the same problem as all CCG or LCGs, namely you have to find people who are "into it" in order to really play.)

Very interesting. I am looking forwards to trying this one  again, and hopefully with a different scenario. It seemed to scale well with 4 players. 

Enjoyed it so much i paid out good cash for my own copy.

Love how the scenarios are tied into the movie. As a pretty big fan of the LOTR movies, it's always fun fighting for Middle Earth and fending off orcs and spiders while keeping the fellowship alive and moving forward. Replay value is high since there are endless possibilities with aspects such as deck building, expansions, saga expansions, etc. It's also not a steep price to pick up one or two expansions to extend the game for another 3+ rounds of fun. 

This game has a relatively steep learning curve to begin with, but with tutorial videos it's a whole lot of fun battling alongside heroes and hobbits to defeat Sauron.

I originally traded this away shortly after buying it.  But now I've picked it back up in a trade, and have become quite sucked into solo play.  First time round, I couldn't find the theme in the mechanics, but I'm enjoying it much better this time.  Picked up a second core and all expansions in an ebay lot.  Score is for whole package - this is smashing.

Edit: just got back into this after a long hiatus, this time playing two-handed solo.  And what a difference, a *much* richer experience.  Full use of all rules/combos, plus it's easier to enjoy all the cards via 2 dual-sphere decks.

Nice game once you get over the enormous rulebook and badly clarified nuances. Also takes REALLY friggin long to play: 2.5-3 hours!

Not yet sure if I want to expand on the base set. I'd like to play more scenarios but I'm not sure my group would be interested in deckbuilding.

RATING: 7
Fun, but I lost a bit of interrest when I realized booster pack add way too few new cards for my deck creation. There is a quest in each booster and players cards are there in three copies ( useless for bad cards). I wanted to mix and create my decks, but it would cost too much to do so. The game itself stays interresting, but it lost it's building aspect. Also, the new adventure decks are often too hard for generic player deck and thee you to build a sniping deck in order to be able to win. Not quite my thing

RATING: 9
This is a great cooperative game- you really feel like you and your buddies are part of the Fellowship on a quest. A must buy for any LotR fanboys/fangirls out there. Would be a perfect 10 if not for the fact that you need to buy 2-3 of the boxed expansions, 10+ Adventure Packs and 2x extra Gandalf cards to get the most out of the base game and add some much needed replay value. Steep learning curve is offset by really good youtube tutorials. 

Edited up to 9 because the "Against the Shadow" cycle calls for new decks and new strategies that makes the game much more entertaining.

RATING: 6
Again, I just don't get the popularity of cooperative games, hence the average rating. This one is good, overall, and both the characters and the structure of the quests are very well done. There is actually enough going on here that you have to make some decisions how you will combat your enemies, keeping in mind how far you are away from your goal. The graphic design is good, but the game is a little too "brown." The gameplay is fairly quick, with little room for analysis paralysis. My only complaint is that ultimately you are only competing against a stack of cards, so that seriously reduces my enjoyment of the game.

Generally fun, although losses (and sometimes wins) feel like the result of dumb luck rather than poor play.

The fun is in the deck-building. Once you feel like the deck is optimized for the scenario, the game plays mostly automatically, with any decisions merely being about weighing the odds of a given bad thing happening.

I rate this a 6 only because LCG's and games of that nature aren't usually what I'm in the mood for. Between building decks, setting up the quest deck and encounter deck, separating cards afterwards, etc. there is a lot of overhead for a game.

Overall it is fun, thematic, challenging... just less than streamlined for my taste.

This is the one game my wife will request. Fantastic artwork, and if you are into the collectible aspect, there is so much gameplay here. I played the core set 50+ times (in those early days while Hunt for Gollum was 'On the boat' for months and months) and the game has only gotten better and better if also more complex with each expansion. Best with 2 players. Fantastic with 2 players.

Got this in a math trade.  Not a game for me.  I've tried each of the starter decks several times and against different adventures.  It just didn't grab me and make me want to tinker with the decks to try and beat it, which means there is no point in my keeping this.  Perhaps if I were a bigger Tolkien fan I would have had more reason to really get into the theme which is probably what makes this game shine.

Fantastic deck building game. Great game to play with friends, especially if one does not have a desire to play competitively against friends and would rather play together in a competitive environment against a common goal. The Living Card Game format fits this style of game perfectly as each month new quests and cards will come out to build encounter decks and fellowship decks. Playing alone makes the game more difficult and often times frustrating. The quests were obviously made to be tackled as a group although the first two are beatable alone. The deck building will only get better with time as more expansions are released and I look forward to playing it in the future. Great game and definitely worth the purchase.

Played the first two scenarios to date (first with two, second with four players, one core game) and I am quite happy with it.

A really great game. Although my attempts to build a proper (and working) deck so far basically failed, i'm sure i'm going to play this more in the future.

At the moment i'm making up my mind about purchasing the missing decks of the dwarf cycle and the Hobbit expansions. On the pro side is my strong wish to construct a great dwarf deck. On the con is the price of all those expansions which would sum up to get a few other stand alone boardgames...

Unplayable because too complicated, is the same as worthless. It does not defy description so a 2, +1 for the nice pictures.

This is a fun game that I usually play solo.  It is more fun with 2 or more people because of some of the card interactions, but you could also play for 2 people solo.  It can be very difficult, but the challenge is what keeps you coming back for more.  The supplied starter decks aren't great by themselves but by mixing them, I have been successful with the first 2 scenarios.  The third scenario is very difficult.  Play for me is usually between 45-120 minutes, I take my time. I also enjoy the deck building aspect of the game.  For those not interested in this, there are plenty of suggestions for good decks for particular scenarios online.

The first quest is more of a training exercise, but the other two are fantastic and appropriately challenging.

Have only played solo thus far but bought it mostly for solo play any ways.

I made a bunch of mistakes for the first few play throughs but by the 4th or 5th time I started to get the hang of it.  Means it may take some re-learning if it goes on the shelf for a while.

Turned out to be pretty fun.  It's the first collectible card game where I've actually wanted to try out some deck building.  The starter set seems to have a lot of replay value compared to most starter sets for collectible/living card games.

In order to combat "bossy" players, common in co-op games, players aren't supposed share which cards they have.  It's an interesting mechanic that I think could work well.

The game's starting to grow on me.  Ranking it at a 7 right now because I can't fully judge how good the replay value is but if it sticks with me for a bit longer it's going to have to be adjusted to an 8 or 9.

This game just keeps getting better and better.

[2014.Jul.03] Still consider this more of an activity than a game. (Rating unchanged.)

[2013.May.21] Like many other Fantasy Flight Games productions, The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is gorgeously produced. Unfortunately, it is not an Eric Lang game and it shows. There are too many random elements in this cooperative game that prevent any real control or strategy on the part of the players. Simply put, game turns consist of doing the best that you can with the cards that you happen to have your hand at that moment. In my opinion, it is more of an activity that you participate in, than an actual game that you play. Could have, should have, would have, but in the end didn't.

Theme and artwork are fantastic and game play works, but many of the scenarios are uneven - being either too challenging or too easy or both - yes both, as some are too challenging early on and then too easy by the end.  Many scenarios reach their point of highest tension well before the end of the game, leading to many rather dull conclusions.

Yo pensaba que un juego de cartas de este tipo no me iba a gustar, y menos siendo un sacacuartos LCG, estaba equivocado. No es que sea un superjuego con mayÃºsculas, pero me estÃ¡ empezando a picar y es probavle que en breve le suba la nota. Comprar ampliaciones es por puro coleccionismo, se puede jugar y pasarlo bien con poca inversiÃ³n, el juego bÃ¡sico se queda un poco corto pero no hace falta comprar TODO. DespuÃ©s de muchas partidas, sÃ³lo una pequeÃ±a rectificaciÃ³n, no hace falta comprar todo, pero lo acabarÃ¡s comprando, siempre vas a necesitar otras cartas para mejorar tus mazos en cda aventura.

LIKE:

* I'm a big fan of the LOTR universe/theme.
* Tokens were appropriate and good sized.
* Instructions seemed quite clear for the most part.
* While the play is cooperative, there is limited ability for one person to play the game for everyone as the cards in hand are secret.  Still susceptible to one person taking control to some degree of played characters.
* Lots of randomizing effects for which you must be prepared.

DISLIKE:

* Text is small and sometimes quite crowded.  
* Still mixed feelings after one play.  I'm not interested enough in the game to buy it right now but I'm happy to play copies belonging to other people.
* Starter set should come ready to play with four but only comes truly ready to play with two.  I know FFG needs to make their money, but this feels like outright milking of a popular theme and I'm hesitant to buy into this.

This is my first encounter with this kind of deck building game. I have played Dominion, but I think it doesn't compare to this.

I was initially put off by this game. I didn't seem to like playing with cards solely and the game seemed somewhat confusing to me. I shelved it for a couple of months. After reading a lot of amazing reviews on the game I wanted to give it a second chance.

Then it clicked. I like this game! I've only played the first scenario for like six times now, 4 with leadership mono sphere and 2 with tactics mono sphere. They are completely different, and I think that makes this game beautiful!

The art is also brilliant as are the card synergies and the different enemies you encounter. You are on your toes constantly.

Eines meiner Lieblingsspiele, das ich oft solo zu Hause spiele.

Jeder Spieler hat 3 Helden und jeder Held sammelt pro Runde jeweils eine Ressource, die wiederrum zum bezahlen von ausgespielten Handkarten benÃ¶tigt werden. In der Tischmitte sammeln sich Orte und Gegner, dessen Widerstandswert Ã¼bertroffen werden muss um im Abenteuer voranzukommen. Gegner kann man auch aus der Tischmitte zu sich heranziehen und bekÃ¤mpfen, bzw. wird von denen auch automatisch angegriffen und man muss sich verteidigen. FÃ¼r alle Aktionen braucht man meisst einen Charakter, der dadurch erschÃ¶pft wird und nichts anderes tun kann. Am Ende einer Runde werden alle Spielbereit, aber die Bedrohung (Counter) erhÃ¶ht sich. Bei einem Wert von 50 scheidet man aus.

                 â J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings 

I think I fell in love with this game when I first opened the box. The artwork is beautiful, the theme and lore are great and the gameplay always challenging, rewarding and just fun. I especially like the narrative element which is hidden in the cards and the story that builds up in my head everytime I play. I mainly play this solo and for me it is the simply the best solo game I ever played.

It's a dangerous business going out your door and buying this one... for me it became my favourite game.

it's a nice game, but only if you use the monosphere decks that are in the box. it becomes boringly easy as soon as you start deckbuilding (even with selfmade scenarios unless you houserule fundamental rules). therefore i don't really consider it a deckbuilding game. what i like the most (besides the theme) is, that it's a 2-player cooperative game.

My quandary with LotR is my quandary with *all* self-designed Fantasy Flight games: an overemphasis on graphics design versus playtesting. For all their fetishization of visual aesthetics, most self-designed Fantasy Flight games fail to deliver elegant mechanics, unambiguous text, and balanced asymmetry. In these respects, I consider LotR perhaps their most startling failure. The artwork is undeniably inspired; the mechanics, text, and balance is undeniably insipid. I strongly dissuade all but the most stalwart of Tolkein aficionados from this decidedly disappointing (and costly!) investment.

Probably much better with expansions, but as a standalone the first scenario is too easy and the other 2 scenarios' difficulty varies extremely depending if you get lucky for e.g. which of your 3 heroes gets taken prisoner in the 3rd scenario, while not having a lot of variety or customization options. While some people will probably disagree with me and say the LOTR card game system was never supposed to be base-game only, I feel like it still should be more complete as a standalone, even if only to draw people to buy more expansions.

EDIT: Agh I have no idea what to rate this game, having now traded it I keep wishing I could play it but remember the gameplay was often not as fun as the expectation. I really like the concept of it with the scenarios, customization options, and how they integrated staging area with questing/combat but 1. even after reading through the forums there appears to be quite a lot of junk cards in the base set 2. there is a huge amount of luck in this game. While some of it can be mitigated and I like some other games that have huge luck swings (e.g. Samurai Spirit), that there are many more unique cards and that the decks change from encounter to encounter makes it really hard to metagame without a huge investment, and there are some e.g. which hero gets captured in the 3rd scenario that you can't really do much to prevent the damage 3. I still remember it as being rather fiddly, and 4. lack of options without expansions. Maybe if someone ported the game system and reworked it a bit it could become a game I highly regarded.

liked the co-operative card building aspect of the game very much, but seems like a bottomless pit with new expansion coming out each month.  Also like MTG you need to know your cards well to build your deck.  This is quite time consuming.  Also the scenerios are DIFFICULT.

There are lots of unoffical scenerios, so lots of replayability.  However some of the stronger cards only have 1 copy in the base game.

The Lord of the Rings LCG is fascinating. The encounter deck seems almost intelligent in its attempts to kill you. The different stages of each turn take a little while to get down, but create deep strategic possibilities once everything is understood. It is hard to "mana-ramp" in this game, creating either tensity or impotence, depending on your viewpoint. As a solo game, it is extremely functional.

I really like this game. The artwork is simply amazing, and it plays really well. Fantastic setting of course, and it is VERY easy to get immersed in the theme.

RATING: 6
Rating is given for the game as a solo game as described in the rules.  I feel that with the card selection that comes with one box, that the solo game is too hard and not very enjoyable.  Unfortunately, FFGs went for marketing rather than good game with the core set.  What I mean by that, the card distribution encourages a player to buy more than one set(or expansions) if they want to be able to win with solo.  I would have rather had them offer a good playing experience from the core set and beyond.

Now as for co-op or playing 2-handed solo....this has been very enjoyable, and I think will be the only way I will play it in the future.....or until I have tried a couple more expansions.  This I would rate more around the 8 range.

At this point I don't think a person could build one deck from 1 copy of the base game and have this one deck beat all three of the quest that come in the base game (playing them singly).  Which is very disappointing to me....but I guess good marketing.  I think it would be possible to customize a deck that is specialized to beat one of the quest, but this is too much fiddling for me.  I will build custom decks at some point, but I would like them to be able to work on different quest.

I'm still curious about this one.  I'm a little leery of the "living card game" concept....monthly updates.....sounds like that can get expensive.  I bought the basic set, and hope to buy a couple updates to see how the series goes.

Definitely a good game. Mechanics are nice and make sense, and trying to beat all those challenging scenarios is a fun experience. I already own a few small expansions and it seems that scenarios are varied and interesting. What's even better, the game fills the deckbuilding void that I had, as I seemed to either not like the LCGs/CCGs that my gaming group plays, or the other way around, so being able to make and tweak different types of decks, and then actually play them whenever I want is what I needed. It does seem that some scenarios don't scale that well for one player, but then again it only makes them more challenging to win solo, which I don't mind at all. We'll see how far I'll go, for now I plan to continue buying new packs as I'm really into the game these days.

A cooperative adventure card game set in Middle Earth.  You have to balance attacking enemies or advancing the quest.  Even easy scenarios can very challenging.  Also there are 4 colors in the game that play very differently.  A good coop for two players.  I have never played at higher player counts.  

I really like the game but keep in mind the LCG aspect of the game and that you need to make an investment to really have the system become really robust.

First play: Slow to play at first becasue lots of looking up in the rules. 
Second play: Need to understand the interactions between the cards to make the most of it. Whether you would perservere is debateable. Didnt really grab me enough for that.

Third: Played again solo, used lore deck, just seemed to be all healing and no power. Again did not grab me. Maybe it is the combo of 2 decks that does it but ?

Fourth : played Aragon deck with spirit. It's better but it is so mechanical, there is so much to do and I don't really feel any fun. Maybe the fun is with 2 players discussing there strategy? I can't be bothered to find out.

Won't play this again.

RATING: 10
Currently my favorite game of all time.  It has much of what I like most in games: resource management, deck construction, a great theme, co-op play, painful choices, incredible artwork, immense amounts of replayability, the ability to teach it as you play, and expandability without breaking the bank.  Also, every time I lose a scenario I want to play it again.  Heck, even when I win a scenario I want to modify my deck to see if I can do even better.  

I know that some people wish this would have been a PvP game instead of cooperative.  I agree it would have been great that way too.  However, as a person with a very limited budget, I really appreciate that it is cooperative.  I have played and enjoyed more than one CCG that I initially loved, but within a couple years become bored with the game.  This is mainly due to the fact that I can't remain competitive against opponents who are able to drop a couple hundred dollars every few months into another booster box that will give them cards which easily trump most things in my deck.  The cooperative nature of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game eliminates this CCG "problem" for people with limited funds.     

Because of all this, and more, I can't imagine it ever leaving my top 10 games of all time and it certainly will never rank less than a 10 for me. If you have never played this game, do yourself a favor and give it a try!

Highly thematic title with wonderful artwork and tense scenarios.  Somewhat limited original set - clearly designed to encourage future pack purchases.  Best with 2.  Variable difficulty among scenarios is appreciated.  Wonderful co-op mechanic that prevents alpha leader problem.

[thing=77423][/thing] sacrifices some realism* for some tense decision-making, and, yes, it does seem a bit discombobulated without a map/board, but, in the end, I'm fine with that.  Underneath the flogged to death Tolkien theme, there's a pretty good cooperative game here.  And not a bad solo game to boot.  There's also the whole deck-building thing which I really hadn't explored in any game except [thing=53953][/thing].  However, in that game, you build your deck as you play, while in [thing=77423][/thing] the player deck is built before the game.

*Otherwise known as: "What?  If I quest, I can't defend?  And if I defend, I can't attack???"

Though I am not a big fan of card games and I love to play in large groups, I find this game quite appealing. The fact that it can be solo played was a curiosity for me. I know I will not like most solo games, but this one is great.

My favorite game. The theme and artwork is brilliant. And the mechanics sit well with the theme. Plus the deck building gives you so many different choices and opportunities in every game. Plus the new scenarios give the game so many new challenges. This is also a great solo game. Just overall really like this game... and it is a challenge to beat.

Such a difficult game.  Most co-ops are but to me it always feels like it just comes down to what cards you draw rather than any kind of tactical plays you do.  Also, would have preferred more popular characters rather than the obscure ones you get in the core set.  A lot of hype behind this game. I'll admit I bought into it too.  I just can't get into it.

I am a huge fan. I have only played solo so far, but I really enjoy the challenge of building and playing decks. And I have never played any sort of CCG/LCG game before.

Edit - I still enjoy, but I haven't pulled it out as much lately. Unfortunately, the fan scenarios are often more fun than the FFG ones.  As someone who doesn't come from a CCG background, the deckbuilding is not as interesting to me - and I find that it takes so much time that I spend more time creating decks than playing the game.

Definitely my favorite LCG from Fantasy Flight. Excellent solo and team co-op, but extremely challenging. It's a little tough to introduce to new players, but if you can find someone to play with regularly, it's a lot fun. While it can be very tough, there are numerous variants and tweaks you can play to make the game more accessible. The game does a great job of immersing you in the world and quests through gameplay and flavor texts taken from Tolkein's works. I'd recommend to any player whether you're a fan of LOTR or not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
In a way, the game-play of this really reminds me of the LotR board game.  The mechanics, theme and difficulty are nearly identical.  It can be amusing at first to build a powerful deck and collect new heroes and adventures.  The art is gorgeous especially since they did something completely original rather than steal from past artists or the P Jackson movies.  The game is also extremely fast/easy to setup and take-down.  But that's about it for me...

The biggest problem with this game is how much lore and consistency you've got to give up to make any kind of story work.  You'll find a lot of places, events, and characters in circumstances they have no business in.  That may not be a problem for some, but I just can't get past it.

The other problem is how much you need to spend just to make a real game of it.  The game ships with a paltry 3 scenarios, but the last one is nearly impossible without better cards.  This is a horrible decision from FF as the game screams, "money grab" right from the start.

I bought this, really wanting to build a deck with characters that truly make sense for the story, but I have to buy several different expansions for that to happen.  Seeing Eowyn at the ripe age of 7, running around Mirkwood with Denethor, of all people, just destroys this game for me (actually that sounds pretty creepy, no wonder Eowyn had men issues).

Another thing is how repetitive the scenarios become.  There's little variation and surprise to each one.  This is designed for munchkins and power gamers who want to grind through the same content with the perfect deck.  This is great for those people really into MMO raids, Pokemon, and Monster Hunter.

Until I played Pathfinder ACG, I didn't realize how much the the above issued bothered me.  I don't think I'll be playing this game again.

I wanted to like it, mostly because of the theme, but also because I simply wanted a good LCG, I can enjoy. However, I am very disappointed by this game.

The production value, as usual with FFG, is awesome and the art is especially gorgeous. 
But the game itself feels extremely imbalanced, dull and the mechanics never comply with the theme. 

1)
At least one of my 3 Heroes is basically completely out of the game, because he or she is solely used for their willpower. Once exhausted, that Hero can neither defend nor fight later on. This aspect feels extremely weird and unthematic. What exactly is that Hero doing, when exhausted for willpower?!?! Is he or she standing around, thinking really hard or what? I mean, I get that Heroes need to be strong mentally and physically, but still, their mental strength does not hinder them to fight and defend (at least in the books and movies everybody fights on a quest). So, this mechanic really sucks. 

2)
Another aspect that feels really weird and unthematic is that your Heroes are rather weak. Their hit points range from 2 to 6 or so and their defenses and attack values are not especially high either. Heroes die very quickly, and they have their hands full even with a couple of orcs. Remember the movies? When did the Heroes really had their problems with a couple of orcs??? Never! I am not saying, that orcs in this game should only be cannon fodder, but why do I need two (actually even three) Heores to defeat an orc? This brings me to another annoying game mechanic.

3) 
Your cards, Heroes included, can only be used for one action each round (this is why you need two or even three Heroes to defeat an orc). Once exhausted for willpower, that Hero cannot defend or fight in the same round anymore (and you need to exhaust them for willpower, because enemies increase the threat value, which is bad and because this is the only way you can advance and eventually win in this game). Once exhausted for defending (implying that you did not use that Hero for willpower earlier), that Hero cannot attack anymore (oh, and here is an exception to the mechanics, because only one hero is allowed to be exhausted for defending against an enemy. WHY?! no one knows. in all other instances there is no limit to how many cards can be exhausted). And attacking is only possible, if your Hero did not do anything at all before (was he or she just standing around, while all others were busy thinking really hard or defending against enemies, just waiting to attack?!)

4)
The resource mechanic seems a little dull. It also seems to me like it does not work really well. Most cards cost way too much for the little resources you get each round. And if one of your Heroes dies, you will get even less. And if you play with different types of Heroes, i.e. with different resource symbols, you will have even less resources to spend on cards. Feels extremely underpowered for real Heroes.

5)
This game feels very imbalanced, due to most of the above reasons. The core set seems unbeatable at times and that sucks the last bit of fun out of the game. Yes, I know, many say that co-op games need to be challenging, but come on, I would like to feel like there is a chance for me to win without buying a bunch of expansions.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game.

spent alot of time and money collecting many add-on for the core set - This CCG hits the theme square on - choosing your heros and then creating a deck and then tackling the quest - very enjoyable . They only down side is there are certain cards that physically you want more than 3 copies of, ei you want 3 in each players deck - so buying the core set twice or an expansion twice is a bit of a rip-off - So we use other unpicked cards as a dummy. Other than that i liked this game alot.

8/4/2013 - RJ and I played Passage Through Mirkwood.  He played Tactics with Beorn, Legolas and Thalin.  I played Leadership with Theodred, Gloin, and Balin.  We won in turn 3.  Our final combined threat was 32+36=68. No heroes fell.  Our combined damage on heroes was 14.  We had 5 VP's, for a score of 77.  I said "If we were maximizing VP's, we shouldn't have had Beorn sentinel defend attacks in our last round, we should have let some allies die (chomp blocking)."  My son said, "We should get some more allies in play next time we play."

8/10/2013 - Charlie was racing Matchbox cars, Mom was designing jewelry, James was down for a nap.  What time is it?  Time for RJ and I to take on Journey Along the Anduin!

RJ (7 years old) is a lover of Tactics and a hater of taking on damage.  I like the Leadership and Lore decks solo, but go Spirit when pairing up with Tactics.  RJ chose Beorn (defender), Legolas (attacker) and Gimli (wildcard).  I went with Dunhere (to pick off enemies in Stage 2) Eowyn (obviously) and Eleanor (manage "when revealed" + wildcard).

Opening hands were amazing - 2 Blades of Gondolin for RJ, 2 Unexpected Courages for me.  I had two Northern Trackers, RJ had some good events (Goblin-Cleavers, Quick Strike, Stand Together) but he lacked Allies.

Here comes the Hill Troll! :angry:  

Beorn took one for the team, ending up with 5 damage.  However, we were able to load up damage in turn 1, and in turn 2 able to use Goblin-Cleaver and Quick Strike to finish him off. :arrrh:

Our plans came together nicely.  Eowyn and Gimli were consistent questers, and we supplemented their Willpower with discards and some Allies (early Wandering Took, later Northern Trackers).  Legolas was a monster!  He attached both Gondolan Blades and I sent him an Unexpected Courage.  He was generating 10 attack and 8 progress (with lethal attacks) each round.  We blazed through Stage 1.

Early in Stage 2, we had 5 locations in the staging area. :sauron:
The Northern Trackers were the key to resolving this difficulty.  In 2 turns, the 2 Trackers had the locations cleared.  Eleanor had attached the second Unexpected Courage, and was protecting the Tactics team from "when revealed" effects frequently.  Legolas, Eowyn and Gimli led the team past Stage 2 in short order.  Off of the raft, and into the Ambush!

Dunhere came to the rescue with both Goblin Snipers, knocking them each off before they got off any damage.  In fact, after a massive attack by RJ's heroes (and lone ally Bifur), a single Sniper in the staging area was all that stood between us and the path to the Golden Wood.  Dunhere rode off to staging, and returned with glorious Victory!

Our final "old school" score was
72 threat + no death + 14 damage - 10 VP's (Gladden Fields x2, Hill Troll) = 76.  I didn't count, but I think it was 5 turns.
:A::W::E::S::O::M::E:

1/27/15 - SNOW DAY!  RJ and I, with Charlie's help and support, took on The Long Dark.  RJ went with a mono sphere Tactics deck with Bard the Bowman, Elladan and Elrohir.  I had a mix of cards maximizing card draw, shadow cancelation, and questing, with Eowyn, Theodred and Beravor.

We started with Massing in the Deep and Foul Air.  We set the stage for very lucky locate quests - I drew a PASS on my first try with Foul Air.  We played five turns - drawing mostly treacheries, two monsters that RJ engaged by never defeated, and two locations. Two Snowborne Scouts took out one of the locations before we even needed to travel there.  One Locate test took five tries, but Gleowine, an event (I forget which one) and Beravor kept me card rich.  Our questing was strong as we weren't really up against big threat in the staging area.  In turn five, we sent everyone to the quest, and finished strong.

10/3/2015 - Charles had been asking all week that we try LOTR: TCG rather than LOTR: The Confrontation.  He set up he deck with Eowyn, Legolas and his custom Charles card.  He took on Spiders and Flies, and after a rocky start (drawing Ungoliant's Spawn for his first round), he found his way down Beorn's Path.  Great fun!

Actually don't own this one yet as its waiting for me for christmas.  I've been reading up on it non stop for a month and can't wait to sink my teeth into it.  All of my two player gaming as been competitive up until now so I am really looking forward to this game.  Love the lore, love the mechanics and greatly looking forward to dropping a ton of money on this title over the next year.

Update:
Got this for Christmas as stated above, played a few times with a couple different people.  Only worked through the first Passage Through Mirkwood though so lots of adventures left to explore.  Overall, been happy with the game.  It's the only co-op game currently in my library so it gets played when I don't feel like confrontation with other people.

LotR: TCG is a great game. It has great Tolkienesque artwork, streamlined rules, and theme that you can feel. It plays quite well as a solitaire game, as well as multiplayer. There's so much variety to explore between the numerous published scenarios and options in the form of deck building.

rating after 50 plays: Difficult to learn at first but lots of fun. Some confusing rules and fiddy at times. At first played only with 1 preconstructed deck. Now I play mostly with 2 decks (simulating second player). This makes more sense (ranged, sentinel, 1st player,...). Also deck-building is fun and playing with such decks. Also lot of fun in 3-4 players but easier to win in some scenarios.
I have only 1 core set.

The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Although Iâm not generally a fan of cooperative games, the idea of a combination with deck construction is appealing and demonstrates that FFGâs greatest strength might be the willingness to try something new every now and then. The implementation is slick, although nothing in the game system itself feels as fresh as the Call of Cthulhu or Warhammer LCGs did for me. A personal highlight is the elegant way the adversarial deck is constructed depending on the adventure youâve decided to tackle.

What came as a bit of a surprise, especially when considering the excellent and new art that the game is blessed with, is how little the theme did for me. This might be an effect of too much rather than too little personal love for Tolkienâs work - to me, Eowyn and an errant halfling on a quest along the Anduin feels like fanfic. It never happened, and whatâs more important, it never could have happened in my Middle Earth. For me, the game would probably have been more immersive with a completely generic fantasy background like the Runebound world.

That the game gets a rating of 7 in spite of my personal peeves about coops and Tolkien worship is testament to its quality, and if you donât share these peeves, this is highly recommended.

Update: The 7 only applies for the 2 player game. With more, it gets a bit slow and the usual problems of cooperation games without traitors or hidden information get more noticable. Furthermore, the scenarios apparently are a lot easier with more players, which could and should have been balanced better.

RATING: 8.5
Solo / Co-op LCG - oh my, what an idea.  My main complaint (and this is all on me) is that I'm not a LotR fan, so I can't relate to the theme.  However, the mechanics make it easy to overlook that fact.  This is pretty addicting so far.  I always want to play at least 2 games back to back.  I'm going to be in trouble once I pick up some expansions.  This will get expensive, but I'm looking forward to trying to build the best deck to beat each quest.

+ It plays solo (although it plays better with a friend)
+ Gorgeous artwork
+ There is deck building!
+ It's not a pushover game
+ The scenarios are varied and interesting

I have grown to love this game more and more for many reasons. But the main one is, I used to love Magic but those days are gone. I still love creative decks to play with though and this game gives me that outlet. Right now the options seem thin or predetermined a bit, but as they add cards the choices grow. And I enjoy a good challenge.

If I had any real knock against this game it would be that it seems like it is tough to create 1 deck to do well in all scenarios...especially solo. So I think what is needed is a prime deck with a larger sideboard to adjust per scenario.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a pretty brutal game, difficulty wise.  Especially so if you're new to deck building.  That being said, it's been a great game to introduce me to deck building.  I love the LCG aspect as well.  Overall, the theme and the mechanics provide a very enjoyable experience that's only dampened by the crippling difficulty.  But that being said, the difficulty provides a lot of replayability as you try to overcome the game in feats of wonder with your deck building and strategic skills.

The perfect game for me. A great balance of a theme that I adore, deck construction that tickles that M:tG itch, and varied gameplay. I can play this on a small table while I watch a movie with my wife or I can sprawl all across the kitchen table in an epic battle. Sure, it requires some buy-in, but it is significantly less than many games, and I get significant milage out of every card I buy.

This is a fantastic game. We traded it because my husband found it too challenging and because it's a lifestyle game. You need to spend a lot of time outside of playing it to build your deck and then tweak it. We don't have that kind of pre-game time to commit. I'm also leery about games where you feel like you have to keep investing money in them because content just keeps coming out.

2-Player coop with very Magic-like feel to it. The basic premise is fun, but not enough card variety and feels pretty mechanic. What's most upsetting is FF's marketing strategy (buy 3 core sets to have 3 copies of that card, cards in first expansion useless unless you buy 10 other expansions...)

I was having trouble with the card mechanics of the game.  The guys I was playing with kept mentioning that certain aspects were like MtG which at the time I hadn't played.  Ultimately the game group decided it wasn't for them and I think the guy who'd bought it eventually sold it.

My first LCG, and got it because it plays well solo. Which it does, but the secret is that you have to play two-handed (i.e., with two decks simulating co-op) to really get the most enjoyment out of the game.

I love the idea of questing, the deck construction aspect, and the mechanics. I've bought a lot of the expansions despite not being particularly interested in the LotR theme, which should tell you how good a game it is.

I'm working my way through by playing the APs and expansions in order, using only the cards available at the time of release.

RATING: 6
This was the game the demonstrated to me that I don't really like deck building outside of the game itself. I loved the theme and thought the game was very interesting.  Plus, I love co-ops.  However, I still ended up trading it away due to the fact that I just don't like deck building outside of game play.  I know that this is unusual, and I probably would have liked it a lot more when I was younger and had more time.  Now, it is the social interaction with other players that is the main reason I play, not the mental aspect of making a great deck.

I can appreciate the game's design and the production that went into it, but it (and the LCG model) is just not for me. I made a foamcore insert for the game that holds all of the cards I own and other components. The cards are in great shape and the Heroes are all in sleeves.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will likely never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

I didn't love this after my first play, and I'm kind of glad of it. Unlike other LCGs, which I don't need in my life, this one being full co-op means I can happily play a friend's copy and never invest in any cards. I usually rate collectible/expandable card games a 2, as I have no desire to play them again in large part because of the infrastructure and investment involved, but this one's a bit of a different animal. My 6 is based solely on its gameplay, which ranges from okay to fun.

I like the shadow mechanic for modifying monsters, and I love that it's co-op with deckbuilding. My first play was a four-player game with one core set, which I understand isn't the full experience -- 30-card decks, not 50, no deckbuilding, and mono-sphere decks. But it was enough to give me a taste. I suspect it will improve with a second game, and improve again with some deckbuilding.

I didn't like it too much. maybe because it was the french edition. I should try it again with english edition. but other than that, I like more a fixed setup in a game and then different possible branches available from that setup. even if the setup is variable, it should be in such a way that more or less you can do well in the game. however in this game I feel that the choice of heroes you take at the beginning can be more critical than what you do during the game.

I'm not into deckbuilding, so we'll see if this rating lasts. I bet it won't, but I'm going to try a few expansion packs and see if I get into it. My wife enjoys playing it, so it's got an added incentive to be good.

Update 8/9/11: Lowered from 8 to 7, based on the included scenarios and cards. The game system is still an 8, but until I have some expansions I'm not going to rate the system on the base game.

Update 11/2/12: Rating back up to 8. Fantastic game, great expansions. Love the scenarios.

 A fairly typical Fantasy Flight game which means a lot of mechanics that don't add up to a worthwhile experience. BTW, I am not a hater I have a lot of their games that I enjoy. Played the in development version at Gencon 2010 but I don't think that the game will get much better by the time it ships late this year.

RATING: 6
At 22 games in, I must be enjoying the game to have kept going that long with only a few wins with no real sign off improvement. I play mostly solo with a single deck (usually Leadership).

The thing that I notice most is how very swingy the game is. Sure it's a card drawing game so there's bound to be elements of luck, but I regularly lose to a bad run of draws -especially if they come early. In this context, "bad run" typically means either a run of Locations with no Monsters, or a run of Monsters with no Locations. This is particularly an issue in single-deck play as each deck is sort of a one trick pony. Or it is for casual play. Deck-builders may have a different experience.

I need to try the various Easier Variants or dual-handed play to see if it helps before I invest in a second core set and the saga expansions (which were the reason I thought about playing in the first place).

8 Still exploring the base decks on the introductory scenario, but there is alot to like about this game.  Really interesting combinations, hugely thematic.  Same things I liked about the Game of thrones LCG but without needing others to play against.

Look forward to seeing how the difficulty scales on the tougher scenarios.  An easy 8 to start.  May got quite a bit higher - depending on how I like the deck building element.

RATING: 8.8
It is astonishingly good with 3 or 4 players, and fun to solo: great expansions; wonderful art direction; excellent rules. Easily the best Lord of the Rings game ever made. FFG's LCG concept is a winner.

One of the best things about the game is the fact that the experience is customizable: our group has many different types of players, who like to play very different types of games; decks can be built according to player preferences, which is a huge plus.

Further, the scenarios are quite challenging, taking considerable time to master (Along with the stock scenarios, I have both Khazad-Dum and Dwarrowdelf: these are well worth it). Scenarios also play quite differently with different numbers of players.

Some players hold the opinion that the game is "unbalanced." This is not the case; it is challenging; it takes time to master. Currently, I win 90% of my single-hand games, although these are almost always interesting and challenging. My current deck drops to about a 50% win rate once the challenge level gets into the 7-8 range.

The expansions are excellent and keep coming.

RATING: 9
Beautifully thematic deck building co-op game with the benefit of being able to play solo. Quests and spheres of influence really bring customization and theme together, where you feel like you are genuinely on a quest, with each quest being varied enough to be distinguished.

The phases and rules will likely confuse many players to begin with, so it's worth watching the FFG videos and playthroughs to get an understanding; however, this is a treasure of a game I will always regard as a favorite.

RATING: 6
Once you beat the three scenarios, there isn't much challenge left, and the game becomes repetitive. I guess that's because it is a co-op game and because there isn't much variation. I don't have a desire to buy the monthly-or-so expansions.

RATING: 9.75
I suspected I would be hooked on this game the first time I played it. I was introduced in 2015 by my friend Chrispy. It wasn't necessarily love at first sight, but as I kept thinking about the game in the days following I knew I was going to have to buy it. I enjoy that I can play it solo and do a little deck building (a nice escape into nostalgia for my old MtG days) but I really enjoy playing with one or two friends. The cooperative discussions about how to overcome the challenges of the quests, and how to tweak the decks between plays are my favorite moments. I am glad there are a lot of expansions, because this is a game that I feel like I just want to keep playing. It's telling that the box and the cards have been permanently out on my gaming room table for months on end.

My favorite solitaire experience (along with Space Hulk: Death Angel). I am a lifelong Lord of the Rings fan, and I believe this conveys the universe of Tolkien quite nicely. Coming from a background of CCGs, primarily MTG, the mechanics of this hold up nicely and I particularly enjoy the cooperative aspect. It is a short game, 30-60 minutes, and readily teachable to others who may be interested.

I was persuaded by all the positive reviews on LOTR:TCG. I really loved the game at the start and purchased the Mirkwood cycle. Now, after many plays, I'm really hesitating of playing it: only the 'right mood' does it now... Somewhow I don't like the challenge: first I loved it. The game is hard to finish, but now I'm more and more believing it's impossible to finish properly (without multiple MULLIGANs, etc.). It's not a game for me. From now on I'll stay away from these kind of cardgames.

For trade and for sale: together with the Mirkwood cycle and Massing at Osgiliath. If you want to buy it: the price could be negotiable... :) Also: if you'd like to buy or trade something seperately, please PM me.

I hated this game for quite a while but I've finally learned how to enjoy it. Now I pick my hero's based purely off theme and story rather then building them to beat a specific quest. Now Im able to just enjoy the story as it evolves. 

Update: I love the storytelling concepts in this game but the actual gameplay experience is too difficult and mathy for me. Unfortunately the storytelling doesnt flow naturally, you must go out of your way to make sense of the random cards and build it into a cohesive story. There are too many other games that capture the spirit of adventure better than this. I may buy the hobbit set in the hopes that they reset he difficulty but with the rediculious difficulty levels common in the game the experience just drags on too long! 

Update: in the end I decided not to throw away the game just because the difficulty balance is tuned too much for hardcore lifestyle gamers. At this point I just change some rules slightly to make the scenarios fun or simply avoid the poorly balanced ones.

It's a coop with roughly the same difficulty as Ghost Stories on the tougher encounters and feels kind of the same when you play it.  It's very tight but then that forces you to come up with creative ways to defeat the game engine. It's a sound game mechanically.  Still making up my mind on how much I actually like it.  After a few plays like many co-ops it starts to feel scripted.

Update: downgraded to 7.  Just not feeling it.

Didn't understand it the first time I tried to play it. Put it away, traded it off a few weeks later. Snagged another copy on the cheap and had a much easier go of it. The phases are still a little confusing, but overall the rules make good sense. The decks compliment each other very well and work with their themes in a fun way. Good game.

like Death angel with more choices, loads going on various enemies and quests do change the way you play and construct your deck , some times lose to bad luck of draw but thats evil for you..getting better now i know the cards feel more skill full then lucky 
rated high because its earned its money and had a lot of replays!
fussy deck building.. over hard? 
I play  on easy mode  now  kinda just right difficulty wise

I'm back in the game, after a long time on the shelf, 
i play on easy now, i plan to play on easy, then if i beat it try again on normal 
easy mode is start with extra resource and the FAQ tells you take out some Hard cards
you never lose cards the cards it removes are normaly x4 cards and it often leaves you with 1 or 2 instead.


Very happy with easy mode
very happy with the card art
bought multi cores so I can have
1: a solo deck for 1 hand play 
:2 2 ready 2 hand decks  and the base adventures ready to roll out the box


Own 
all Cycles
all box sets apart from saga
will continue collecting


must read back to basics in the forums

played mostly solo
played 2 player regularly now
finally played a 4 player games but only 1st quest

Great game. Only gave it a nine as I have only had it for 3 weeks and will revisit this socre after a couple of months. However, I have not touched another game since getting it and I am only just starting to create my own decks, which is adding a further dimension to the game. Cannot fault this game, having great fun playing it. Oh and I have only played it solo. Looking forward to two player...again this will add further dynamics to the game. Great Game!

The fantasy adventure theme of Descent, but shorter.  The teamwork of Arkham Horror, but easier to teach.  The variable player strategy of Race for the Galaxy, but interactive.  This is the tabletop game experience I've been looking for.

And not only can it be played solo, but a solo deck must be tuned to meet the challenges of different quests, so it's a gratifying experience that I am hopeful won't get stale after a handful of plays.

Feb-10-2012: Every adventure pack for the Mirkwood cycle presented a unique challenge and some great new player cards.  This game has so far stayed as interesting as I had hoped.  Still going strong!

Jan 2013: Down from 9 to 8.  This one has seen less and less play.  I simply do not have the time to rebuild my deck and revise my strategy after every loss.

RATING: 7
Great co-op deck-construction LCG that is a lot of fun solitaire and with more players. I was really skeptical about having a game where I need to buy new cards to get better decks, and then also buy new cards to get more opposition from the game. It feels counter productive but when I played the game I didn't mind and the deck-creation aspects are really nice.

Like all other LCGs it's still hypocritical in that you need to get 3 copies of the core game in order to build great decks from the start.

[u]01/24/2013[/u]: Hmm.  This is a tough one for me to comment on.  I think it's my second most played game at the moment?  The theme is fantastic, one of the strongest themed games I own.  The inner workings of this game amaze me.  How all of the different decks of cards not only interact with themselves but with (and against) each other boggles my mind.  The replayability is quite high, especially if you decide to continue purchasing the monthly expansions that are available.  Solitaire play is easily the most challenging of any game I own.  The card quality and artwork are top notch.

However, I had never played a CCG or LCG prior to this journey I attempted...and I struggled.  A lot.  Just read some of my play log and you'll see the frustration in many of them.  The one thing I learned about myself after playing this game - I'm not a CCG-style deckbuilder.  To play this game, you really need to know all of your cards.  And know how all of your cards will or will not work together.  And then you have to take the time to put the "right" cards together in a single deck.  Only then will you be able to play.  You will realize that your deck isn't going to win and you'll have to tweak it.  And probably tweak it again.  And probably again.  Eventually, you will win, and it will feel fantastic.  And then you'll decide to start over with a different set of heores or a different combination of spheres.  And the process will repeat.

Yes, you can just keep the single, pre-constructed decks alone and play with them, but I don't think success will find you often.

As you can tell, my "problem" with this game is me.  Not the game.  I'm just not a deckbuilder at heart, I guess.  I could just go on the forums and build other people's decks, but 1) that feels like cheating and 2) I don't have most of the cards other people do because I only own one core set and none of the monthly packs.  That's really my negative about this system of gaming...you really should buy the expansions to get the full experience.  I've gotten lots of plays of this amazing game, but that's because I'm so bad at it.

If you enjoy CCG-style deckbuilding, adding this game to your collection should be a no-brainer.  AND, if you need or enjoy playing alone, this has it all in one box.  Well...plus several expansion packs.

[u]10/15/2013[/u]: The second game to leave my collection.  An excellent game that, ultimately, wasn't for me.  It's in a better home now.

First got to play this at a friend's house and was underwhelmed by yet another milk-the-cow franchise.

I'm so glad I was wrong. The original art really gives it its own unique feel, and the gameplay is just spectacular.

This game would be not playable without the internet, For  nearly every card is a FAQ or errata available.

But I think I'm motivated to play the solo games

Me compre el Core Set de este juego y lo he estado jugando en solitario principalmente y me encanta. La verdad es que no es nada sencillo ganar, pero eso mismo lo hace tan adictivo, ya que te quedas picado tratando de hacer nuevas combinaciones en tu deck para poder ganar, y por lo general vuelves a perder jaja. He pasado tardes completas tratando de pasar alguna aventura, y desvenlandome para poder ganar, y despues de muchos intentos al final puedo decir que por lo menos las 3 aventuras que vienen en el Core Set se pueden ganar en solitario, solo con cartas del Set Basico. Digo lo anterior porque hay personas que pueden llegar a dudarlo y darse por vencidas...

Lo unico "malo" que le veo al juego es que es super adictivo,  a veces me quita tiempo de mas, y ya empece a comprar nuevas aventuras y expansiones y no creo poder parar de hacerlo...

My Husband and I play this one alot. It really works for weekday evenings or other times when it is just the two of us. The theme come across well, the artwork is great, and the difficulty is well balanced - we loose enough to keep it interesting, but we win enough to keep it from being frustrating. I would recommend using the victory points to reduce threat on a one for one basis - It makes it seem like the victory points are meaningful. Conflict at the Carrock has been the best scenario so far.

Fantastic, highly thought provoking, immersive, great theme, fantastic artwork, thankyou nate french.

Does need expansions though. (There is no shortage of these).

RATING: 8.5
Much like any card game, Lotr:LCG has a problem with a few cards that are absolutely obsolete. It also seems to have a few issues with power creep - making the a bunch of the core cards loose value over time. However, this is a minor problem when considering the good sides of the game has.

After 45 plays, this is ranking really high in my favorite games. The setup time is extremely minimal - if you have your decks (quest and player) built, it takes about as much time as Race For the Galaxy to get going (just hit the cards on the table, shuffle and play), takes a really suitable amount of time (30-45 minutes for the tighter quests), has tons of bang for buck (with 2 Cores and an Expansion, the game is currently at 2â¬ per play, and decreasing) and this can further be enhanced with more expansions and the Nightmare mode (yet to be tested).

The biggest gripe for me is (and this isn't a huge deal, even less than with Netrunner) is that you really need two Cores to be able to tackle the harder adventures. Luckily this also allows for a 4-player mode and gives you even more tokens, that WILL come in handy. 

A really good game, one of the best I've played, co-op or no.

Comparing to other Co-ops I've played:

Arkham Horror: swifter gameplay, less time for setup, more strategy, about the same difficulty, less players, both have tons of theme, you feel more powerful in this game, you feel less personally invested in this game, LOTR is the better single-player game, Arkham has dice and I like dice. Both are beautiful. Arkham is more fun to pimp out.

Ghost Stories: LotR has better theme and integrates it better, Ghost stories is harder, both set-up quickly and play relatively quickly, LotR is more varied, LotR is better with other players (less quarterbacking), both can be brain burners, both are stunning visually, Ghost Stories is a lot easier to teach and get new players to try it out, Ghost Stories has a better manual (imho).

Pandemic: Lotr setup is quicker, both look nice (though LotR is nicer by a good margin), Pandemic is easier to teach, Lotr is a lot more varied, has less quarterbacking, expands better, is harder and more strategic. I really don't feel for Pandemic.

Mage Knight: I think Mage Knight is the closest comparison that I can give to LotR. Both are card driven, require long-term planning and resource management, though I think LotR is harder. Mage Knight has more rules, but I think it has the better rulebook of these two (especially if you count the extremely good tutorial videos). Both are really stunning looking. Mage Knight has you invested in your characters story. Mage Knight has a longer setup and a longer playtime which does prevent it from hitting the table as often. It also takes a lot more space on the table. Both are really good single player games and I love every minute of both.


(260415) I still like the game a lot, but it doesn't hit the table that often. The rulebook still seems like a mess and I'm glad that there are videos online that teach the game (looking at you Rodney and Ricky). The deck building isn't as immersive as it is in Magic or Netrunner, but just as necessary. Perhaps this is because I don't have as many cards available?
I really like playing the game, but only when I have a new adventure at hand, and I always feel somewhat hesitant in picking up new content, since the game isn't on the table that often.

* Excellent LCG (Living Card Game) with an equally excellent theme
* Rules are relatively straightforward, but card synergies leave much open to debate
* Good as a solo affair, but more engaging and rousing as a multiplayer experience
* Line between an LCG and CCG (Collectible Card Game) seems like it is blurring

* Playing monosphere decks gets a bit "samey," and not too up on deck building
* Losing some luster as a solo game, and can't find too many multiplayer opportunities

A co-op collectible card game; quite possible the first collectible card game that I'll actually like. 

I'm absolutely loving playing this game solo; in one four day stretch I clocked in 8 plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best co-op card game. I love LOTR and this game did not dissapoint the frnachise at all. As with most CCGs/LCGs, there are a lot of small questions relating to card effects and interactions but it doesn't detract from the game. The quests are challenging and the quality of most of them is excellent.

Edit:
This game suffers from one major flaw, decks must be built per quest otherwise it's just too challenging (read:impossible). I like this game a lot but playing some recent quests with my favorite decks and getting destroyed first turn or losing on a card draw after an hour of playing killed it for me.

Fantastic game that is really fun to play solo - looking forward to playing this a lot!

RATING: 9
Play and manipulate cards to complete quests in Middle-Earth.

Plays: More than 200.
Type: Thematic cooperative game = a theme-driven game where you play together against the game. Deck building pre-game.
Complexity: Medium strategy game.
# of players: 1.
Playing time: Depends a lot on the scenario.
Player interaction: Best played solo. Otherwise cooperation.
Randomness: Low â card draw, but you decide what cards go in your deck.

Replayability: Very high. The possibility to play every scenario with a different group of heroes and different resuorces makes you want to play again immediately. Often you want to play again with the same setup as well, just to see if you can beat the scenario if you do things slightly different. Deck building increases replayability even further.
Fun: Itâs fun to try to come up with the deck and the plan to beat the scenarios. Playing the scenarios can also bring a smile to your face when good things happen, for example when Gandalf comes up just when you need to get rid of a particularly nasty enemy. Itâs less fun when the scenario is just destroying your heroes, but if youâre playing solo thereâs no problem to start over.
Memorability: Medium. This creates a story about heroes questing in Middle Earth. Itâs not deeply immersive, but definitely good. Youâll not remember the details, but more of the general feeling of each scenario.

Thematic integration: Good. The game does a good job communicating the theme. The art is evocative, your favourite characters are all here and there are lots of Tolkien quotes on the cards. Itâs as good as it can possibly get in a game that is ultimately about resource management âunder the hoodâ.
Components: Excellent. The art is great and the cards are of good quality.

Who will like this: Gamers that want a game to play solo and like the theme.

This one is sinking a bit for me; I've fallen behind in the sets, and deck construction becomes a more time-consuming task as more cards are released. Still, a lot to like here, both solo and in a group. I think it's thematically successful, punishing without being unfair (for the most part), and lovely to look at. It's fiddly, though, and lengthier than it should be at times. I hope it makes a comeback for me.

One of my favorite solo games. This is an excellent, often very thematic experience, especially if you are a fan of Tolkien. The sheer amount of available content provides tons to explore. The game can be brutally difficult and unforgiving, and that's not always what I'm in the mood for. Also, I've found myself less and less enthused by the deck construction element of the game; I'm more likely to get something else to the table these days. So, that brings my rating down a notch.

The LotR LCG is a quality deviation from most of FFG's library.  Where most are competitive and involve taking a specific side, LotR lets the player choose a subset of the fantasy world for their team and play cooperatively against a stack of encounter cards and a short narrative.

This game is best played with other players familiar with text-heavy card games; otherwise you'll find yourself just managing the other player's actions and diminishing the enjoyment for everyone.

Co-operative LCG worthy of its theming.  The co-op nature of this one means everyone is very willing to share deck design and strategies.  This puts the focus on the community beating the game, not each other, making for a nice shared experience in both building and playing.  The LCG approach means the time invested will be rewarded, and the game will evolve in interesting ways.

Relatively weak core set hampers my rating of this game. Coming with just one or two copies of certain important cards like Unexpected Courage is a blatant cash-grab, and while I can understand that decision, I like the core set less for it. The game itself is enjoyable, though Flies and Spiders is too easy a scenario, and rather lacking in theme. Concerns about replayability and the limited nature of the strategies available in the core deck pushed this from an 8 to a 7 for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great 2 players adventure, less satisfying solo (unless you can deckbuild skillfully. The LCG formula means you have to pay to enjoy in the long term since every scenario, after some plays, become predictable. Plus some card mix is thematically pretty questionable: the plus is that you are (more or less) free to experiment thematic decks, aggro decks etc.
Overall it's a nice, hard-to-win game.

I apparently hate making my own decks. I liked the gameplay but when I was supposed to make my own deck I got fed up and sold the lot. I would gladly play with pre-assembled decks again. Funny thing is that I like making my own decks in MTG. Apparently LCG isn't my thing.

RATING: 7
Der Herr der Ringe: Das Kartenspiel ist ein Living Card Game, doch anders als die anderen bekannten Vertreter, handelt es sich hierbei um ein kooperatives Spiel fÃ¼r 2 Personen. Beide Spieler benÃ¶tigen jeweils ein Deck, damit sie zusammen die Abenteuer bestreiten kÃ¶nnen. Dabei geht es direkt von Anfang an zur Sache, denn die Abenteuer sind alles andere als einfach. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad zieht sehr schnell an und dementsprechend muss man sich einige Gedanken zu seinem Deck machen. Geht man dann auf die Suche nach den passenden Karten, stellt sich schnell ErnÃ¼chterung ein, denn die Karten der einzelnen Fraktionen sind Ã¼ber alle Erweiterungen verteilt. Ich verstehe natÃ¼rlich, dass Fantasy Flight Geld verdienen mÃ¶chte, aber um mir ein optimales Zwergendeck zu bauen, brauchte ich auch diversen Erweiterungspacks immer nur 1-2 Karten. Eleganter fÃ¤nde ich hier Fraktionsbasierte Erweiterungspacks. 
das ganze problem wird verstÃ¤rkt, als das wir mit unseren fertigen Decks bei manchen Abenteuern einfach chancenlos waren und der Eindruck entstanden ist, wir mÃ¼ssten uns dafÃ¼r neue Decks bauen, oder zumindest etliche Karten austauschen. Insgesamt: Cooles Spiel, aber man muss einiges an geld reinstecken, um lange Freude damit zu haben.

LCGs don't work too well for solo games, because you have a limited pool and fixed scenarios, there's really only one efficient way to build a deck. Art is great and does a decent job of capturing the universe, but just not that fun as a game.

Update #2 (11/29/11):  More of the same goodness with the Anduin River quest.  Definitely rate this a solid 9 for game in general, and a 10+ for the experience and bonding factor it gives me with my 13 year old son.

Update #1:  Wow, this game has some fun interesting twists and turns to it.  Definitely not a 1 trick pony.  Fun, challenging, exciting, and thematic.  Like the fact that I played the 1st quest (Mirkwood Forest) with the Tactics and Lore spheres the 1st time and won quite easily, and the second time it was a much different and more difficult experience.  

The theme is great and shines through strongly, some difficult choices to be made, and quite fun and exciting when you are successful, yet leaves you coming back for more when you are not.  Glad I picked this up.  Perfect game for my 12 year old son and I.  Rating is a solid 9 and may go up from there.

Good solo, but better & funner with 2.

I enjoyed this one quite a bit for awhile, but I REALLY dislike the fact that you have to modify your deck for each quest. You can't simply build one deck to your liking and run through the entirety of the game and its expansions that way. Having said that, I still think that this is one of Fantasy Flight's best LCGs, and contrary to popular opinion, is better than the Arkham Horror LCG that has supposedly replaced this.

Nice deck building game. Difficult, but gives a good solo play if you're up for the challenge.

It takes a while to get past the instructions, but once you learn that all the steps must be taken in strict order and that exceptions are on the cards this plays beautifully.

It is difficult to beat in single player but draws me back in again and again.  Looks like becoming my LCG money sink...

This is a great game to play as a co-op campaign with one other person. Like other collectible card games, it does require some commitment in learning the card pool and what is possible to add to your deck. However, it's not as bad as Netrunner in that aspect since you can ask the other players for advice.

If you buy a second Core Set you can expand the game to 4 players, but I think it's best with 2. The game is easier with each added player, and playing only 1 player is very difficult unless you play two-handed (using two decks at the same time). 2 decks is a good balance of difficulty for most quests.

One issue of early LOTR LCG releases is card balance, with some cards being vastly better than others. An example of this is the Steward of Gondor which nearly doubles your resource generation at a tiny cost. So you can get the feeling that some cards are too good to ignore and that limits the deckbuilding. However, this is not as much of a problem in later sets as the cards have become more balanced over time.

2014: I wanted to like this more: the art is gorgeous and the mechanisms are clever. I struggle to muster much enthusiasm for the deck construction aspect though (would rather be playing something) and hence a lot of the experience is a bit lost on me. Also, I don't actually enjoy it enough to want to invest the time becoming *good* at it.

2015: OK. May have to revise my score up a bit. Turns out that my partner quite enjoys this, and it is certainly more fun (and achievable) with 2 players. In addition, greater familiarity with cards is resulting in stronger opinions about which cards are more or less useful (or when and for what).

I love The Lord of the Rings and this game nails the theme with the artwork, campaign, and cards. The game itself is a lot of fun but hard, so some thought about card synergy is needed before starting the quests. Fun gameplay and definitely plays well with some Howard Shore in the background. ;)

I've only played this solo, and aside from Dominion, I'm not a fan deck building.  So factor that in to my opinion.  

This is nice little game.  The base game comes with 4 starter decks.  Each plays very differently from one another, so once you've become overly familiar with one deck's play against a particular quest, you've got an instant re-boot just by selecting another deck.  And how long does it take to get "overly familiar"...I'd say 10-15 plays or so.  So with 4 decks and 3 quests, that comes to 120 - 180 plays.  Not bad!

Now about my score.  This is a very thematic game.  The cards within a pre-determined deck speak nicely to one another, and the adversary decks that get put together for a given quest our very cool, doom-filled, and thematically aggravating!  My main beef, and the reason I don't rate the game higher, is that honestly I don't find it to be a very strategic game.  Tense, yes.  Tactical within a given turn or two, yes.  But when people say that this game is "hard" they mean "hard" in the same way that rolling a 1 or 2 on a ten-sided die is hard.  Just my $.02, and remember, I'm not someone who enjoys the fiddling with decks part of CCG / LCGs.  I get it, that is where the strategy is going to be.  Even so, though, rest assured, if you are NOT in to deck building, this is still a very engaging, thematic game.

PS - The "Watch It Played" videos were invaluable for my learning the game.

Update:
Lowered to 6. After the initial burst of enthusiasm about this game, I haven't touched it.  Nothing was pulling me to play the game, and I came to think of the theme as, well, not so well done.  I want my LotR literary, and finally never felt like playing this one with friends.  So, it doesn't do what I want a game to do.  Still admire the mechanics.

In this cooperative card game, players are going on quests with characters from Lord of the Rings. First, you get 1 resource per hero, and with these resouces you can play allies, attachments, etc. Each round, you then have to decide which of your characters to commit to the quest, then defend or attack against enemies. The trick is that your characters can only choose one of questing, defending or attacking before their card is exhausted for the round. 

The time pressure element is measured by "threat". If you don't proceed along quests very well, you gain more threat, and the game ends for the player if you exceed a certain threat. 

The quests have different levels of difficulty. I'm having fun trying to survive the more difficult quests and like the puzzle solving aspect of that. 

The mechanics are borrowed from Magic:The Gathering, but it's a fun fresh cooperative game each time.

It's also a much better game than The Game of Thrones:LCG, by the same designer. I'm having fun experimenting with the four different themed decks and looking forward to more plays. You can play it solo, or with more players, where you can see interaction between the various decks, so there is more variety. 

However, there are all sorts of rules questions, which take some time to sort through. You will need some patience to get through all the different rules for different scenarios.

Solo gamer's stranded on an island game.  Customization means lots of replays and allows for varying difficulty ratings, since you can challenge yourself with less than OP decks.  Theme is of course very strong - and customization allows for theme only deck creation.  The game is challenging too.

Considered perhaps the best 2P co op thats a medium weight and time (3.1 weight and 60 minutes with an adventure story). But it supposedly is an LCG or so, so its expensive and limited replay alone. Also the theme is LOTR, meh. Considering in the future still because I heard good things though and its supposedly an okay ish solo game too.

Probably wont get cause I heard its two player mode requires both players to deckbuild together, and its low replay so a lot of people need to buy a lot of packs to get into the adventure and story.

A great but very expensive (as with all LCGs but i think this is the most expensive game of this format to this date) co-op game.
I love the deckbuilding in this one and the fact that you can play it with a friend or girlfriend/boyfriend without creating any rivalry between you.
It engages you completely in it's concept and the thought you put in your deckbuilding really pays out when the encounter deck is out to annihilate you!
If you can afford it,it's a great game.

High learning curve to begin with and some very frustrating/random events, which can cause a world of pain to new players. This game takes a lot of patience early on and I would suggest playing some games with people who already have the core set/decent cards before making a purchase. The core game as a standalone is great in terms of presentation and the cards themselves. However some may be disappointed with the lack of replay value with the core card pool. If you are willing to spend a bit of money on expansions the game really starts to open up and can be a lot of fun. If you love lotr and it's expanded universe then this is a great hobby game to get into. Just don't expect the core set to be a great standalone product as it's basically the gateway into the game.

As of August 2014, I've got everything up to Kazad-Dum. Haven't felt the need to keep buying, as I have plenty of quests and deck building options, and am a little burned out on expansion.  I can't justify buying these and the Netrunner expansions every month of so.

Usually play it solo. Played it loads when I worked shifts, and sometimes take it with me when travelling as it's so portable. Beautiful art and lots of theme.

2017 - loved this, but sold it for Arkham LCG. LotR got unwieldy, more and more cards, keywords, and triggers. The last scenarios I played were a mess, and I missed he simplicity of the earlier ones.

Man oh man where to start? First of all I must admit I am a Tolkien fan (not saying huge because I know how some fans are but in any case still a fan), so any opinion of mine going into this will be completely biased, but then again I don't see how anyone can dislike this game. The base game: It has a really good replay value, lets get that out of the way because I have read my fair share of reviews on this game before purchasing and that seemed to be the main concern, that the game is only enjoyable if and when you buy a ton of expansions. No. Just no. If you want more quests, just go to the forums and search for custom scenarios. I downloaded a few and printed them out, sleeved them and they do increase the replay value, but still I believe the main three scenarios still contribute to that a ton. Other issues people had was how tough the game is. Simple solution, easy mode. Just start playing easy mode and work your way up to standard, that's what I did and I don't see any shame in that at all. Anyhow lets get to the game itself. It is extremely thematic, I mean every time I start a scenario, every time I read the flavour text of a quest I feel completely immersed in the experience. I read a ton of flavour text when I play this game because it is fun, it just makes the already awesome challenging gameplay that much better. The artwork is just spectacular. Everything about this game is good, just brilliant!

With a saga expansion under my belt, I can say this game has drastically improved in the thematic sense, something I did not think was possible. It amazes me every single time I play through a quest how masterfully some mechanics have been designed for certain story elements. They fit in so well that the gameplay is silky smooth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a game for which you need to adjust your expectations. The point is not so much to win the scenarios as to customize your deck to do better in the given situation. Love the theme and the artwork, and even the underlying mechanics, but the game is so hard that you often don't feel like you had a chance even if you had made all the right decisions.

This game is just not for me.  I realize many people enjoy what this game offers, but I was unhappy with a number of elements of this game that left a bad taste in my mouth.  These include:

1. I thought the game would provide versatility in player number.  But really if I wanted to play with four players and have the requisite 50 cards decks, I would need to buy two base sets. This was not something made clear.

2. Adding to the above, if I wanted to play a 2 player game and construct a deck with multiple factions, either the other player is forced to use the unused factions, or if I want 3 factions, the other player is out of luck.

3. Only the first quest is playable single player.  THe other two are so difficult it ruins the game.  Even using pre-constructed decks by other people who we "crushing all the quests" led to loss after loss.  Losing the game after turn three 5-7 times in a row just leads to aggravation.  It's the same feeling I get when I am stuck at the same place in a videogame and have to play the same scene over and over again.

4. I don't want to buy expansions just to get to the playable material and the 2 expansions I did buy with the base set didn't add all that much (except another quest).

5. Most of the game seems to revolve around the deck construction element.  Once constructed it's about seeing how that deck plays out.  There's very little in game decision making that needs to take place.  If you lose, you go back to deck construction and try again.

I do like the mechanisms of the game and the way it flowed.  I really did want to like this game.  But now my eyes just pass right over it in favor of the many other better games I have.

RATING: 10
This popped up on my radar and I hesitated for a while.  After FFG revealed the 3rd preview, I added it as a pre-order and began tracking its' progress.  It quickly became my most anticipated game ever.

I love LotR.
I love CCG's.
I, by necessity, only buy solitaire-playable games at this point.

This game is AWESOME!

It captures the theme for me.  Most every play could easily have been written as a story about Middle Earth.

After 26 plays, 25 of which are solo, I do not think this plays like a puzzle.  Nor does it feel like the game is playing me.  A good part of that has to do with the theme.  It also has to do with reflecting on poor choices I made that let the situation get out of hand.

Is there imbalance between the decks?  Yes.  Legolas and the Bad-Ax boys are terrible on their own.  They kick backsides and take names when used with another deck.

Is there luck involved? Yes.  It's a card game.  Luck happens.

Does it feel like unlucky situations can be overcome? Yes.  And, even when things go terribly wrong, I can't help but feel the evil forces of Sauron winning this battle.  Gotta get a new group of heroes and create some threat of my own.

Can you play with 4 people with 1 set?  Yes. I played one game with 3, using a piece of paper to keep track of my threat.  What fun! In fact, it appears to scale really well.  I thought we'd rock on the Mirkwood quest, and it actually got tricky and required some careful cooperation to win.  We all had a blast.

Are there any broken cards?  No.  I consider myself to be a decent CCG analyst.  Having played through the first two quests, I have found the cards to be well balanced.  There is one broken situation that could possibly happen (2 crows left in the encounter deck during the quest phase with Thalin participating in the quest), but good luck trying!

At first I was perturbed because FFG did not include 3 of each card in the box.  However, after reading others' comments on the geek and more consideration, I have decided that I cannot fault them.  The game stands on its' own.  The buyer is not compelled to dive into the expensive and time consuming world of customizing decks.  And if you do?  Just buy a 2nd set!  If any of the CCG's you love had done this, you would have been ecstatic!

Why this is a 10
+ I do want to play this most all of the time.
+ I love the theme and its' implementation
+ I can play it by myself, but it also works great with 3
+ I love having the ability to manage my own luck in a game
+ gush, gush, gush - BLECH!

I love just diving in with a single sphere. I also love 2, 3 and 4 sphere decks and all play different and offer a unique experience. Replayability is very high.

I've 'iron manned' it going through all 3 core scenarios in one sitting and just played stand alones.

And I haven't even mentioned the LOTR theme which so richly informs each unique play.

I've been giving this game as a gift to relatives. Can't recommend this game highly enough.

Wasn't sure how I would like the game, as I haven't played many cooperative or solo games, but I was pleasantly surprised.   The game has nice variety in the game play of the four different base decks and the three scenarios (I have played two).  I was impressed by the feeling of urgency and unexpectedness that the designers were able to structure into the game.  My biggest complaint is that the options for customizing the decks using only cards from the core set are limited.

RATING: 10
I have played this a lot solo and co-op with the wife (one of her favorite games).

I never really played games where you have to build and plan a deck out in advance of actually playing (e.g. Magic).  I wasn't sure I would enjoy it or not - but its actually a lot of fun to do that.  You can spend hours fussing and planning over how you want to build your decks.  Great for obsessive types.

If you know you don't enjoy deck construction games like Magic the Gathering, then you're probably going to want to skip this one or rely on a friend or use pre-made deck lists others have made.

Key Points:

- adjustable difficulty level
- tons of replayability
- tons of different content available
- approx 1 hour play time per scenario
- expensive (to get enough cards to build decks)

Very interesting quest vs. combat decisions. All hell can break loose very very quickly, which can make the encounter deck seem too luck-based. But mostly the risk can be managed once you start to learn the decks. I'm not a fan of the LCG distribution system though, as you need more than one set to play a "full" experience.

Yeah so this game is all about the building outside the game, which kills it for me. Bleh.

I'm quite surprised that it clicked with me that good. Very beautiful artwork on the cards, the story of geting through Mirkwood (1st scenario basicly) spoke to me and the mechanics were nice. The diffrent "factions" worked and had distinct flavor to them. Gotta get some additional packs so it would be possible to make some multi-decks and have some choice while doing it. Basegame has just enough cards to make them, but not really have a choice about cards to put it them. 
Good game.
Update. The more quests I've seen and played the more I love this game. First saga expansions were awsome, really gave sense of adventure and searching for something. Game seems to become more and more mature with each new cycle. While Mirkwood was ok and fun, Khazad-dum and Dwarrowdelf have been very-very good. And as I said - Hobbit saga block is just plain awsome fun.

Wow... solo mode single-sphere is a bear! Solo dual-sphere is a much calmer and less luck-defined experience. The game takes up a decent amount of table space (for a card game) and is slightly fiddly. 

Co-op is a bit easier - multiple spheres really help out. You really feel like you are helping each other survive - which is feeling absent in most other co-ops.

The game is a bit hard to learn/teach to those with no equivalent experiences in some other CCG or LCG.

Generally amazing art, very solid game play, great theme. This is going to be quite addicting...

200+ plays. What I thought was a clean set of rules (on the reading) turns into an FAQ mess through all the card interactions, however once you get past that and print off some of the excellent aids to help ... there's good decisions to make on what cards to invest in and when. Then it's choosing which units will travel through your quest (but which are then unable to defend against baddies), which do you leave on guard against potential upcoming baddies (the turn of a deck), and which to then leave available to whack the baddies back in return. All of which disguises the fact that your result will probably reflect the luck of the cards, but at least you'll have enjoyed the struggle to do the best you can with what you get. This is good fun with another gamer (definitely not a spouse game) who's into the theme and the CCG genre (ie comfortable with card effects), otherwise it's going to be tough to get to the table. The scenarios always have tight spots where you think all might be lost, and it can be an amazed satisfaction afterwards if/as you get through it. The more you play, the more important it is to keep cards as specific answers to specific upcoming events rather than play them out just because they're good now and you have the resources available to spend. Which also means knowing and tracking what's left to be dealt with in the encounter deck. There's a bunch of scenario / deck combos to work through before you need to invest more. A keeper if you have someone to play it with.

Not my wife's cup of tea, but rich in theme.  Nominally good gameplay as co-ops go.  Now that my son and I are playing every Saturday, I find it rich and engaging.  I think about it all week.  That's a sign of an immersive game.

RATING: 6
What I like:
- Pure co-op with pretty good theme and pretty art
- Fan-designed and official expansions available if needed
- Each sphere has a very different flavor

What I don't like:
- I think you have to enjoy deck construction to really like this game
- Gameplay can be a bit repetitive and a bit random
- 2nd scenario is BRUTAL, and the last 45 minutes of your game might just be postponing your inevitable doom

Not being a deck construction guy, it's hard for me to treat deck construction as being part of the fun of the game. To me, constructing a different deck for each scenario feels a bit like cheating. Also, beating a scenario may require taking advantage of little quirks in the rules or the scenario elements. That also doesn't feel like a fun part of the game.

The game also feels a bit like a video game, where you play a scenario repeatedly (often losing), learning how to construct a deck (or at least play your deck) to win. I have not felt that with any other co-op.

The BGG 2.9 weight seems about right. It's substantially more complicated than Knizia's Lord of the Rings boardgame.

I played it quite a few times now. I bumped it down a bit to 7.5 because I like the Star Wars LCG better. It's a good game and I will keep it as my only solo player game for me to bring along on travels since it is Compact. I'm curious to try out the quest packs. 

I have no bested the Mirkwood (DL1) and Down the Anduin River (DL4) comfortably enough to take on the third and last quest of the core set. After that I will move on the Hunt for Gollum. 

I have committed to purchase one quest pack per month up until I find loose interest (if ever).

Neat game but the theme doesn't come across at all to me since it's just playing cards and whilst the artwork is fantastic, it doesn't really work as such. It's a neat solo playing card game (problem resolution exercise, which is something I enjoy doing).

Nice fame but gave it away. Not.good enough for me to sit down and play on my own. I rather do something else when on my own...

EDIT:
This has dropped significantly for me. I think it may have worn out its welcome. It is just an extremely hard game and it wears on you after a while. I do really enjoy this game and I still think it is the best FF LCG but we are taking a break from it.
LotR is my LCG. There are many FF LCGs that I enjoy playing or can appreciate are good, but LotR is far and away my favorite one. I love that it is a co-op game instead of a head to head. My fiance and I like to play a lot of 2 player games, since we are both avid gamers and sometimes it's hard to find others to play with. It's really nice to take a break from always beating each other up or going head to head to work together to complete some quests. This game is HARD, but boy is it satisfying when you win. And the idea of it is so unique. There are not many other collectible games like this that are co-op. Pick it up and give it a shot if you never have. I can't recommend it enough.

I love the artwork and presentation. I think some of the designs are the best I have seen in any game. I love using the characters and attachments too. Overall though, I  have had to make a lot of simplifications and changes in order for this game to run properly. The more I play, the more the unnecessary complexity grates - shadow phases - the way each location has different rules - and actually progressing through locations, keeping track of the sequencing of events etc. Still - there is some kind of magic there...

Fine cooperative card game. I like how a real story is told when playing a scenario.

This game just works fine as a 2-player cooperative game. I love to try the scenarios. Still very difficult, but yet fulfilling experience. I raise my rating.

RATING: 7
Remarkable card game that is complex enough to get the brain working overtime. Wonderful strategic workout that is far less luck dependent than one would expect. Plays well solitaire and travels well on business trips. 

The expandability of the system through low cost add-ons means the adventures can go on for a long time without getting stale. Accommodates user made adventures very well. Solid, knowledgeable and passionate community. 

Very solid 10 and one of my best game purchases ever (computer or board).

============================

Adjusting rating. Loved the basic box and got many good hours with it, but once I tried to keep up with all the expansions, things got a little unwieldy. Attempts to play with 3 players were always a little chaotic and started to find it annoying to keep track of all the modifiers flying around. I may pick this up again one day but for now it is off my radar when I choose something to play.

RATING: 7.5
The game is really nice looking, you can see that they put a lot of energy into the design and even into the originality of the quests. You must work together, from 2 to 4 players to complete a quest, but it is not easy as you need to build decks to fit specific quests, otherwise you will get slaughtered. The main problem is that it seems that the actual play through of the quests was not tested very well. They rush out new expansions before they can really ensure that they play properly and therefore you are always wondering what to do in certain situations and have to make a lot of house rules. Improve the game play and this could be a great game, not just a good one.

RATING: 8
I wanted to like this so much, but it didn't deliver. I got the base set and two big expansions straight off the bat. For a single player, there just aren't a whole lot of options. Most scenarios are soul-crushingly hard. I like a challenge, but this game steps on your throat from the get if you don't know the ins and outs of building decks (and I don't). It's been gathering dust, but I decided to throw money at the problem and buy more expansions to give myself greater flexibility in the decks I build. I haven't broken into them yet, but I'm hoping they give this game a new life for me.

Edit- after adding 2 APs and another big box expansion, (DR)I've finally come around. It's a lot more fun when you have a fighting chance. It took a ridiculous amount of money to get to this point though, so I'd caution a solo player that he'd better have deep pockets before breaking into the game.

This is a cooperative LCG where each player has a unique deck and, together, the party advances to different locations, fights various enemies, and tries to work toward some sort of common goal.  I guess it's okay for what it is, though I'm really not sure how well the concept of cooperative play meshes with an LCG.  There didn't really seem to be that much tension in the game, and I didn't see that many opportunities for longer-term strategy, though I admit my one play was in a super easy scenario and I didn't construct my own decks.

Don't buy this. LCG. Deckbuilding vraagt te veel tijd omdat je per scenario je deck moet aanpassen! EÃ©n LCG (Arkham Horror) is genoeg.

RATING: 6
Bottom line: TLotR: The Card Game is a well designed and illustrated game that I ended up not being very willing to play due to its frustrating difficulty.

I love the Lord of the Rings theme and the game & artwork capture it well; however, the game captures the hopeless situation of the good guys too well.  My wife and I love challenging co-op games, but we found this game challenging to the point of frustration.  We enjoy playing The Forbidden Desert.  We often lose, but we always have some new idea to try for the next session.  With LotR:The Card Game we often felt we couldn't have played it any better which dampened our enthusiasm for the game.  Consequently we played LotR:The Card Game less and less and we eventually traded it.

After playing it ALOT in a short time I am not inspired to go back and play again. The crazy level of expansions means that you can fall behind very quick and before you know it your looking at hundreds just to catch up. The massive expansion is what has ended the enjoyment for me. Because I know I will never get them all.

After about 12 games, with a LOT of research for deck building, heaps of advice from expert players, and STILL getting continuously screwed, I just gave the game away. I survived about 30% of the games but it never felt like I ever beat it - just was lucky.

Hmm... thought it was awesome  at first, but the campaigns are only balanced for exactly two players. Solo players will have to look elsewhere for fun or balanced scenarios, which is very unfortunate.

Extremely nuanced game with many rules. Also extremely rewarding. You really feel like you are on a quest. The only downer for me is the deck building aspect. You need to build a fresh deck quite often if you want to stand a chance of completing each quest. I'd rather a little more persistence in the deck.

RATING: 10
This has turned out to be a fantastic co-op game. My wife always enjoys it which is always a big plus for me. 

Extremely challenging at first but you get better with repeated plays. The final quest in the core game is painfully difficult and agonizing (It's awesome!). 

Deck building is necessary for having success beyond the first quest. The good news is if you don't like deck building just look on the site for some Deck ideas and your ready to go. 

The game can be played solo but requires serious deck building to have any kind of success beyond the first quest. Balance seems off as well for solo. The game seems geared specifically for two players.

My favorite co-op to date. This game is going to hit the table often.

edit: having all the available expansions has boosted this up to a 10 for me. It's also now my wife's favorite co-op. edit: ok, its hard keeping up with all the expansions, but you can get many plays out of a single cycle. However the game gets increasingly better with the more content you have.

edit: I really LOVE the art in this game. It's incredibly good (most of it at least, there are the typical cheap rush jobs interspersed). My wife enjoys just looking at all the cards before we begin. I wouldn't mind some of it in a larger size or as my desktop background.

Edit: Yay a digital version is coming. Hope it's good.

Absolutely fantastic first impression when playing the introductory quest. Mechanics were innovative, the game works and plays rather well. Art is fantastic.

The only thing I'm a bit worried about is the deck-building aspect which must be considered when playing the harder quests, be cause I don't like it in general. But time will tell if this game gets even higher rating. There is a high chance that to happen.

The concept of this game is fantastic - I've been eyeing the WoW card game for a while on account of its raid-deck coop scheme, but have always been turned away by comments that it takes pretty serious constructed decks to go up against the raid. Enter FFG's LotR:TCG, a game designed explicitly for deck-building coop, in the fairly reasonable (affordable) LCG format.

So far, after a few solo games and one 3P, I think this game has a lot of promise. With just one core set, deck construction is pretty straightforward - grab the cards from two spheres, pick a major and a minor, and strip 10 cards from the minor. Done. It's still a fun process, though, and there's plenty of room for experimentation with hero selection and 12 Ma/Mi sphere combos.

I love deckbuilding and I love Lord of the Rings lore. After playing warhammer quest adventure card game I played this. I found LOTR to have more depth and with an additional core set (or 2) and some expansions this game has great replay value. The mechanics seem complicated at first but then fade into the background after repeated play. +1 star for solo play, -2 stars for core set leaving out the rare cards and 3-4 player non-compatibility.

RATING: 6
This is probably a better game than my rating indicates, but I had two issues with this one: First, I had a really hard time figuring out the flow of play from the rules and the concept of the different play areas. Second, solo play seemed near impossible to me with the base set, and this was the reason I bought it. Netrunner has since scratched my LCG itch.

RATING: 7
2/16/12 - This took a couple games to grow on me. Once I started building my own decks this became a more enjoyable game adding that extra level of pre-game deck building strategy like Magic the Gathering. Some of the scenarios play in 15-20 minutes which is really nice because sometimes you just get utterly destroyed early so it's nice that it ends quick so you can quest again. This is my new favorite game!

7/15/12 - I've traded for more expansions but haven't really played them. The quests are very hard if you are playing single player unless you control a second deck. I used to enjoy building the decks but now I have to manage 2 which makes setting up take forever which is a huge deterrent when I'm picking out a game to play. I thought getting more expansions would make the game more interesting but it just made it more complicated, not in a fun way. I've downgraded the game from an 9 to an 7. I'll give it another shot.

RATING: 4
Beautiful production values -- the artwork is superior and fits the theme beautifully. The game play really fell flat for me in both the solo and two-player games. Maybe it is just the Mirkwood adventure (which I played and lost twice) but it all just felt a little boring. This will probably end up on the trade shelf, sadly.

RATING: 10
[Initial comments, June 2011, based on core set solo plays only]:
I'm in two minds about this game - on the one hand I love anything to do with LotR, and this game does the setting justice in the art, presentation, and the concept of the game itself, and I've become slightly obsessed with it, playing it more times in a month than any game before (with the exception of Magic the Gathering). So I'd like to rate it a 9 or 10 just on the basis of how often I want to play it.

BUT... it can also be infuriating and it's too easy for fun to turn to frustration in the middle of a game when a nicely balanced, tense situation suddenly goes disastrously wrong due to a series of bad card draws, and sometimes it seems no amount of clever play or planning can help (at least for now, until deck-building options increase).  But the frustration soon wears off and I want to try it again the very next day.

So I think it's probably a great game, but for now I'm reserving judgment on just how great, until the adventure packs start rolling and I can see how well the deck-building elements and diversity of quests work out.

[Edit Sept 2011]:
After buying a 2nd core set and the first three adventure packs, I'm liking the way this game is going. The variety of quests and the different approaches you need to tackle them is great and keeps the game fresh, even when one quest gets frustrating. I don't really understand the complaints about it requiring deck-building, or those who want to use the same deck for every quest - isn't the variety and the scope for experimentation the whole point of CCGs/LCGs?  

My attempts at deck-building haven't been terribly successful so far, but I'm getting a glimpse of how the increased card pool and flexibility of deck construction can help to mitigate some of the initial grievances I had with the game's unpredictability.

Rating up from 8 to 9 - it might go up even further, especially if I ever manage to play it as a 2+ player game.

[Edit May 2013]:
OK, after 2 years I'm still thoroughly addicted - the expansions are really keeping it interesting and my deck-building has improved so I'm getting a reasonable success rate. My first game to break the 100-play barrier and I can't see myself getting bored with it for a long time so I have to upgrade this to my first 10 rating.

Very enjoyable as solo play (haven't had the opportunity to play with others). I really got the sense of being part of a group of heroes from Middle Earth doing quests and vanquishing big baddies (and little minion baddies too). The travel phase feels a little tacked on, though. I hope FFG tweaks the traveling aspect, because encounter deck searching feels more like dealing with threats at a location than removing quest point buffers. Exploring locations needs more rewards. Another thing is that some cards don't have multiples, or not enough multiples, which forces you to buy more core sets or use proxies (and requires more bookkeeping). The core set only comes with three quests, which is a bit low in quantity as well as in terms of replayability. Quite frankly, I have no inclination to replay a quest several times in finding challenges based around pedantic deck tweaking or using other hero configurations other than the perfect (or near-perfect) permutation. That's just replaying for the sake of replaying, which is forced and artificial. However, there are several fan made quests which easily fill in the time-suckage (pleasant and fun time-suckage, mind you), and helps you to get more mileage out of the game, particularly if you're not inclined to purchase the monthly expansion sets. All in all, I recommend this one. :)

edit: after 1 year of play, starts getting a bit samey. the theme loses its edge. down from 8.5 when i first played it. But who cares! This is such an accomplished game. Tip of the hat to FFG for such a fine effort!

An excellent and challenging co-op card game.  The theme and artwork is top-notch.  The mechanics are easy enough to pick up and remember.  All-in-all, a solid game.

Where it falls flat for me is in the challenge of the game and the intent of the design.  With the exception of a few overpowered decks you can build, Each adventure requires you to build a deck specifically designed to overcome it.  If you don't want to peek ahead at what's coming in a given adventure, this means you will need to replay the same adventure (often several times) in order to defeat it.  Some people appreciate and enjoy that level of difficulty and required deck-building as part of the puzzle of the game.  I do not.  I enjoy deck-building, but not over and over for each mission.

We played two scenarios and the game was really easy to beat, we didn't lose one single hero.

Might raise my rating once I play a couple more games at harder difficulty.

A great solitaire game!

Beware the false economy of the LCG format. Although you won't be dropping hundreds of dollars for a handful of important cards, you can STILL be dropping hundreds of dollars.

The game is fun, brutal, thematic, pretty, and good solitaire. My beefs with it are that you sometimes have to build decks specifically to beat certain scenarios, so it's hard to just have "your deck" and take on what you take on.

The rules are a little....bulky? I've played a ton of this and I still need to the reminder text out in front of me to remember what I'm doing next. It doesn't flow in any way that makes sense in my brain. But still an awesome game!

My third LCG I've played and I have to say it's a pretty solid co-operative game.  Rules are on the most part not overly complicated, but there's some niggling fiddliness with the way certain cards can interact.  This is to be expected for these kinds of games though.  First quest in the Core is not overly difficult.  The second quest ramps up immensely and you really need to figure out what you're doing at that point.  Great fun!

Oh, my nemesis! I was so looking forward to this game and we gave it a good shot. Maybe I wasn't ready for it at the time but I felt very overwhelmed by the relentlessness of the enemies that come out and the fiddliness of managing the cards. I really dislike FFG rulebooks as well. They just explain things in such a way that it's 10x harder for me to absorb. Anyway, I can't in fairness rate LOTR on half a play. I would like to revisit at a later date and see if I have an easier time. It's a beautifully produced game. I really want to like it.

This game is absolutely awesome, obviously more so if you're an avid LOTR fan.

Each quest is so dynamic and different, which keeps it so interesting while maintaining the familiarity of your personalised deck.

Quests are really challenging and communication is so important to ensure the party gives themselves the best chance at succeeding.

My only slight quarrel is that there is a constant need  to buy expansions which is obviously expensive, but these are so interesting I'm sure you'll return to replay them.

I really can't recommend this game enough and hope the expansions remain available to buy for a long time.

such blatant stacking against the player.)

Giving 3 points because it has some good ideas buried in it.

A game that is difficult to rate for me. I love to sit around and fiddle with the cards. But so far the actual game play has fallen rather flat for me. Might start playing two-hand (solo) and see if that helps a bit.

Update: The game has finally started to click a bit more. For a while I played with the easy mode. That probably helped. Also gained courage and inspiration from some challenges on the 1 player guild, which also helped. Now I do things at my own speed, so never manage to post for the challenges. Am back to normal mode. And having a blast!

The biggest down side is that I invariably sit around wishing to get more expansions, though this already by far is the game for which I have the most expansions...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A campaign which requires you to buy more adventure packs and expansions to continue the game. 

Each pack allows you to play a few times due to the difficulty of the game. Some scenarios are harder than others and may even require very good "luck of the draw" to help you win.

You are given freedom to build your deck between each scenario, adjusting or even completely changing your deck and heroes to cope with the scenario you just lost. You most probably won't know what's going to happen in the next scenario because most of the encounter decks are new due to the LCG system. 

Only occasionally you would build an encounter deck with previously used "enemy" decks.

Also the scenarios have different types of objectives, it may be just a battle to fight your way in/out, to capture/escort someone or plainly just to explore as much as possible to find something.

The only problem that I see is that u somehow have to buy the expansions because otherwise playing the same quests over and over gets boring earlier than u Mighty think.

This is a really well-designed game. The decision of questing, attacking, blocking, and using abilities with each individual character gives you a lot of options during play. I've often wanted a co-op version of Magic: the Gathering, and this provides all the great tactical decisions of Magic: the Gathering and makes the mechanics work flawlessly as a cooperative game. I only own the base game, and I have to say that the deckbuilding is not good given such a limited card selection, but the expansions should change that. Also, a lot of the cards in the base set seem quite weak, but that will similarly improve with additional investment.

Probably the best solo game I know of, or at least have run across. Also my first foray into the LCG model, and I really like it. The deck construction of CCG's interests me as it does most, but I just can't abide the random purchases. This solves that while still offering that strategy aspect of trying to construct a deck to handle whatever quest you are facing off against. It also plays excellently with multiple players. The theme is also fantastic and feels more than just slapped on, but actually drives some of the cards and mechanics. 

After playing more, this is merely the entryway to the great game. I've upped my rating to a 9 to represent the entire system. The box itself remains only a 8 though. The player cards introduced are generally pretty good and many are still very usable in the expanded card pool, but many are just garbage. And you really do need a second core set to get more copies of many cards including stalwarts like Unexpected Courage and Steward of Gondor. The pre constructed decks they include in the box are bad though. Deckbuilding is pretty much required. The quests included in the box are fine but largely underwhelming. The first one is merely okay and present no challenge beyond the first few games. The second one is pretty good and is a good quest to test decks again. The third one is extremely hard, especially for a solo player. 

Quests: 7/10

Player Cards: 9/10

Impressive. Definitely in my top10

It works great as a coop game and it's even better as a solo game. It's currently my favorite solo game. Personally I love the game and think that even though by being an LCG becomes even better the more expansions you have... the base game is more than decent and you don't really need to own everything. With a couple of good expansions and some knowledge on a buying guide you are more than ready to have a blast!

Lord of the Rings scratches my Magic: the Gathering itch, but can be played solo or co-op, which is a huge plus! I get to carefully craft decks, explore interesting synergies, and commiserate with my comrades when it all falls apart. Most of my plays are solo, simply due to convenience.

All ratings of expansions will be based purely off of how much I enjoy the scenarios, so I can better track which ones I would like to play frequently.

Don't play unless you're dedicated to either building a deck specifically for certain scenarios or willing to dump money to get enough cards to make a largely versatile deck. Once you get over that hurdle, though, the scenarios are great. They also range in difficulty from "autopilot" to "try 10 times and still fail, even with that awesome deck made specifically to beat it".

I've only played it the once, but that one time really didn't leave me wanting to play it again and again.  I'll give it another go, but I strongly suspect that my disinterest in the game will not be dispelled.

The problem with it is twofold; firstly it just didn't feel very interesting - although I would have to accept that this could simply be down to a lack of familiarity combined with the fact that we were playing the very first (and therefore the very easy) quest.

The second problem is more fundamental;  it managed to feel neither particularly fun nor particularly tense, but most of all it didn't feel anything at all like LOTR.  Compare and contrast with the War of the Ring - a game so dripping with theme that the box gets soggy.  In the LCG, you're concerned with entirely abstract matters like threat levels, wound tokens, questing points (or whatever they were called); it'd be a simple enough job to retheme the LCG to almost anything.  You'd possibly get away with not changing many of the names, as most of the people and places in the LCG barely rate a mention in the source material.

So it's not that the game is bad; it's just that it failed to engage me on pretty much any level.  Glad I didn't buy a copy.

RATING: 8.2
The Core Set has all you need to play, true, but consider it more like a "demo", and not a good one at that - the card pool being too limited, IMHO, to give a good idea of the game without frustrating the players. This is almost universally recognised, now, as a bad decision by FFG (and a reason for the low score given on BGG to the base game). Opinions vary about how much Core sets you need, but my suggestion is two. 

Whatever the case, try the secondary markets until you get three copies of each card in the Core set (which is the maximum number allowed in a deck for a given card). An alternative is to "share the burden" with a regular gaming friend willing to buy his/her own copy of the Core set to merge with yours. This will both help you to enjoy the quests contained in the Core and, should you decide to continue, with the first cycle of AP; some support cards are so good ("Stewart of Gondor" comes readily to mind) that you want to have three copies of them in your deck just to increase your probability to draw one. It is also a good way to learn which cards look essential but are actually turds - no matter how many combos you try with them. At this point you will understand why this is truly one of the best card games ever designed.

The game system is clean, easy to learn and difficult to master. Other strengths are the thematic cards and the quests: if you get hooked you will not have enough (the Core set offers only three quests). The storytelling factor is strong, and the art fantastic. This game simply oozes Tolkien, and should be a must-have for all who love his works even if they don't normally like card games.

This ones tough. While I DO love this game and enjoy playing it, it can be REALLY hard to try and "keep up with" I am so behind on the releases. The good news is there is no need to keep up. Just play the core set til you are board and then pick up a pack. There is YEARS worth of play in this game. Play at your own pace and just enjoy it.

This game scratches my long running love affair with the world of Tolkien starting back in the 1970s. If you enjoy excellent artwork and theme, this maybe the it amongst all the LOTR offerings.

The game is hard and one must find synergies amongst the different cards to overcome the quests and monsters, yet it feels rewarding when one wins.

Since I play solo games mostly, the game rules work quite well.

This really is a great card game that has tons of replayability.  I've only scratched the surface of this game but I am seriously impressed.  Production quality is good and I love the art!  

This game is a solid 10.  There is just an endless amount of replayability and deck building options.  The art is great and more cards come out on a regular basis.

I don't get to play this multiplayer as much as I'd like but the inter-sphere strategizing that takes place is amazing. Another interesting facet for me is that the top-notch artwork seems to borrow more from descriptions in the text than the way characters and locations were portrayed in the movies.

Pros:
+ Best solo play on the market, if you don't mind the difficulty.
+ Deep deck building possibilities.
+ Co-op card game, unique!
+ Great replay value.
+ Gorgeous artwork.
+ Lord of the Rings theme!
+ Standard FFG quality.

Neutral:
[b]o[/b] Encounter deck is very wishy washy, adding a heavy luck element to the game.
[b]o[/b] LCG format is less expensive than a CCG but still quite expensive. But you CAN spend what you want and still get a pretty full experience.

Cons:
- Storage and organization for all those cards can be a pain.
- Scales very, very badly. Solo is incredibly hard, 3+ players is incredibly easy. Many quests are nigh-on-impossible to solo.

Primer cooperativo que juego. El juego es bastante narrativo, localizaciones, enemigos, heroes, aliados, traiciones.... hace que las partidas describan en cierta manera una historia. Con la caja basica ya tienes un monton de partidas, son 3 historias, 4 facciones, hasta 4 jugadores, con la combinacion de jugador faccion que puedes realizar a menos de 4 jugadores, son muchas las maneras de jugar cada mision, mas luego el azar de las cartas.
Siendo un cooperativo me he dado cuenta que he jugado mas relajado ya que apenas hay pique entre jugadores.

6/15/11  Have played two games with my wife - both have been really enjoyable.  

While at first blush the game has seemed quite difficult even on the introductory quest, my guess is that with experience (and more card options over time) that it will become easier to play.  Both our games have been very tense - I felt we had a chance to win or lose up until the very end (we won the second time, lost the first).

There are several aspects of this game that I enjoy.  First, the artwork on the cards is very nice and fun to look at while holding them in your hand.  While not of utmost importance to a game, games that look nice are easier to attract potential players to play with.  I find the "shadow" mechanism a neat idea as well.  Due to the fact that you are never exactly sure what you will be up against, you are constantly having to weigh decisions.  Do you quest with two heroes leaving one for defense?  Will the defender be able to deal with the threat or will the shadow card make him more than you bargained for?

It took a little while to get used to the fact that defenders don't deal damage back to the attackers (maybe thats due to my history with Magic) but its starting to sink in.  Its agonizing trying to decide who to send on the quest, who to leave to defend, and who to leave in reserve to go on the offensive.

Great card game.

Most rounds play rather similar. The gameplay's twist is the balancing between adventuring, attacking and blocking, and how you design your deck for these purposes.

LoTR LCG scratches the deck construction itch within a story-telling narrative set in Middle Earth.

A self-contained experience that is playable straight out of the box, and allows for viable deck-construction providing a wide spectrum of different playing experiences that is expandable via Adventure Packs, Big Box Sets, and Saga Expansions.

Throw in excellent, thematic art-work, with canonical flavour text, quests that provide a challenging playing experience, as well as two different modes of play - solo and co-operative - and you have a deeply rich, thematic, cerebral experience.

This game is very rules heavy for a card game however, things become quite intuitive once you start playing a couple rounds.  Tells a bit of a story as you complete the scenario.  There is a bit of luck with this game so you can play optimally and still not do well as card draw is very prominent throughout  so a combination of things can happen that is just bad luck.  Good solo game that played pretty quick and i look forward to play other scenarios which has the potential to raise this rating.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As a solo card game it is hard to beat, there is so much depth to it that if it hooks you there are hundreds of hours of play time just in this box.

The art is rich and the game play is very smooth. My main complaint is that to get the most out of it you need to expand it, which could cost a lot of money and for gamer's on a budget that is a real issue. I picked up a few packs at the start when it first came out but quickly found that to unlock the true deck building options I would need to keep buying packs as they came out.

I would not hesitate to recommend the core game to anyone as it is excellent and if you do fully invest this could be a 9 or a 10 for some people.

This game is quite fun. It is co-operative (or solo, that distinction is fuzzy for this sort of game). Each player has their own heros and deck of cards (you can construct your own like Magic and CCGs) which they play against a deck which forms the quest.
Essentially each round you divide your resources between questing, defending against attacks and killing bad guys. You have to quest to advance the plot, you have to do the other two to survive long enough for that to matter.
The central mechanics are very straight forward but there are sufficient phases and different classes of cards for the CCG style element to come into play. A caveat, this is defintiely CCG co-operative and not deck building (like Dominion). You come to this with a deck you have fine tuned and then you play that deck as is.

My rating is based on solo play. I really wanted to like this game. The artwork and quality of game components are excellent. The concept is great. But solo play is extremely difficult.

This is a good game, but it has some fairly sizeable flaws.  If you are using the standard decks that you are supplied with in the core set then you'll really struggle with some quests - one of the core decks (tactics) is arguably useless in solo for all but the first quest.  There is a lot of luck involved, some plays you will get a nice trickle of locations and bad guys, other times you'll just get flattened with location after location or swamped with a few 'special' guys in a row. On the plus side it's quick, good solo, and pretty addictive.

After my first play of this game, I was very impressed. I won the first game so my initial rating of 9 was solid, but I thought it would go down.

I have played a few more games, all solo, and this game is still a solid 9 for me in that area. I still have 2 player games and expansions, not to mention actually building my own deck.

So far, i am loving this game and I don't think my rating of 9 will go down. I keep wanting to play this over and over.... that's a good thing.

Notes: the game was a little daunting at first. The unique style of LCG took a bit to get the hang of it. Watching a video here on BGG helped me understand the game flow. After that it was just a matter of doing and looking up as I went along. Well worth the effort.

11.15.13 I have been revisting the game in solo mode. this is still the wonderful solid game. I will probably get some more expansion desks. Still a 9 for me.

5.12.15 and I have started playing again. Beat the first two scenarios solo, but got a friend to help in two players to beat all three. Won the first scenario with two players and will finish the other two.

Made the mistake of trying to play this game with a single deck (as provided in the box) randomly determined solo.  As luck would have it - was trying to solve this with the LORE deck and missing a lot of what the game can do.  Then I played a 2P game each with a single pre-constructed deck and started to see how the various decks can start to relate to each other which convinced me that deck-building is the key to this game, not the default single decks.  Wish the game had some suggestions for mixed decks to start with (I know there are threads here with such suggestions) as that would likely attract more players.

Very, very nice, detailed, perfect. Better than movie (which I haven't seen yet) :-)

Ps: rating upgraded  after easy mode rules introduction (without easy mode I would have downgraded my rating for it is unplayable in solo mode in regular/normal mode) but then downgraded because of solo-single deck unplayability and dependance on luck in many/most times...
Still GREAT game though

RATING: 9
"Thrilling, tense, frustrating, agonising, exciting and pure elation" pretty much some up my feelings whenever I play this great card game. After pushing as far as I could through the base game scenarios using just the leadership sphere of influence (SOI), I then tried out the spirit SOI before playing two hands using both SOIs. This culminated in a thrilling finale in the 3rd scenario that ended in an elated victory as my heroes all escaped with all but one of them being one more point of damage away from death! Happy days :)

This is a brilliant game for solo gamers, cooperative groups, and Lord of the Rings fans. Come take an adventure! Although not without flaws, this game really delivers on challenge and enjoyment consistently. Absolutely oozes with theme. LotR does lose a half-point for the 'take my weekly paycheck' approach, but it's wonderful otherwise.

I've played this game hundreds of times solo and it is fantastic. The theme shines through, you can create many different decks to try and defeat many different scenarios. A ton of variety. My kids are now at the right age for me to play co-operatively. The first few games have been even more enjoyable: exploring new card combinations that only make sense with multiple players. The adventure packs have mostly been great, offering new and interesting twists that keep this game fresh. Love it!

I often feel like this game plays me rather than the other way around.  It's "fiddly," meaning that there are a lot of moving pieces to keep track of while you're playing the game.  I realize this is necessary so that the game can be flexible enough to keep adding new scenarios and new cards, but it's hard to be immersed while doing all of the maintenance and keeping track of how many Y's should happen when X occurs, etc.  Legendary has shown that it is possible to have a great deal of variety without being overwhelming.

[b]Thoughts As A New Solo Player:[/b]
There are a lot of rules nuances and things to keep track of. I've played several games and watched several play-throughts and I'm still missing and forgetting things.  I had to write my own player aid to keep track.

It's REALLY HARD to get started when you are new to the game.  So much so, in fact, that it is actually frustrating me to the point of dreading playing it. Here's why:

To do well I have to build a deck and to build a deck I need to know the cards.  But to know the cards, I have to play them and to play them I have to build a deck (chicken and egg problem here).  The only other option I have is to use the 'decks' they mention in the rulebook which are not decks, they are just all the cards from the same sphere. Those 'decks' are designed to be played with two players (2 decks).  So as I play with those 'decks' solo (with only 1 deck), I lose over and over.... and am forced to play the same scenarios ad nauseum without success (no rewards or 'YAY!!' moments) just to get enough experience to see what cards I should consider for the first deck I build.  My only other option is to run two decks at once while learning but that just makes the rules nuances (mentioned above) harder to manage.  It really tries my patience...  :arrrh: :shake:


Going to try [url=https://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/beorns-path/]Beorn's Path[/url] to see if it can find some fun in this game again ...

RATING: 5
Need more plays, but after the first 2 games (one solitaire, one 2p), I'm not seeing much fun factor here.  It seems to lack any of the escalation that I love so much in coop games like Pandemic and Flash Point.  I was really hoping for more theme, more story, but the fact that the quests are only 3 stages and the encounters are random really prevents it from having an interesting story arc.  Looking like a potential trade at this point.

There is a bit of a learning curve to this one but it was definitely fun! I've only played the first two scenarios on solo (I've heard the third one on solo is next to impossible) but this was a blast, especially for a LOTR fan like me!

RATING: 7
Played 8 games solitaire one handed. I've now transitioned to playing solitaire two handed.

I enjoy this game, but deck building is something I'm not used to. As a Tolkien fan, I want to play decks that are thematic. I don't enjoy building decks & heroes that don't fit into the canon. But I'm not in a hurry to spend a lot of money to pick through the expansions to get there quickly. I think I'll learn more and do better if I work my way through the expansions in sequential order.

I dig the art. Storage takes some work. The instructions seemed fairly clear. I had a few errors in play, but I think I've got the general play sequence down now. The procedural game play is kind of a drag, but seems necessary since there are so many card interactions. 

Enjoying it so far, but rating it a 7. I like the game play. I love the theme.  However, because the deck building mechanic, and the need to tailor decks to each scenario acts as a minor drag for me. Also wish it wasn't so hard or expensive to build decks that are more thematic to the literature.

For Lord of the Rings: The Card Game I could write 10 pages of glowing review and still not give the game enough praise. The game is just that well designed.

So let me say this - 

This is the best deck-building card game currently in print.

That is a big statement and true in every sense.

In fact, the best thing I can say about this game is that I have created an entire Geek List just for it. You can find it here - 

http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/176849/lord-rings-card-gam...

This game is sheer beauty at every step. 

The design is fantastic with wonder cooperative game play against a brilliantly brutal A.I. 

The artwork is lovely. 

The theme fits perfectly and is worked well into the game. Truly an integrated theme.

I could keep going, but I am sure my point is made.

I can only think of three drawbacks for this game. First, this is a living card game, so continually buying the new Encounter packs is essential if you want to keep going. Second, this is a true deck building game and some people do not like the deck build aspect. Third, the game is really difficult. Be prepared to lose a lot. This is frustrating for some so they stop playing. But life in Middle Earth was never easy.


Pros - 
- Absolutely brilliant in every way


Cons - 
- Deck building, living card game and the extreme difficulty could turn some away

Lord of the Rings: Card Game has numerous expansions.  To name them all is silly because there are so many.  This is due to the living card game nature.  New expansion and Encounters continue to come out on a regular basis.

Instead I think it is better to describe each type of expansion.  There are 3 types of expansions for this game that are actually part of the game and contain player cards.  While all 3 types are different they are extremely similar within their type.  There are 2 type of Expansions that exist sort of outside the game.

The first type of expansion is called an Adventure Pack.  These are small box expansions that provide a single new challenge or Encounter.  Each contains a new Hero and two new cards for each color Sphere.  These are part of a larger group called a Cycle, which is 6 Adventure Packs together.  Each Cycle is named for the general aspect of the story it encompasses.  

The second type of expansion is called Deluxe Expansions.  These are big box expansions and provide the player many new Encounters, usually 3.  Also included are many new Heroes and cards for each color Sphere.  These are stand-alone expansions that explore, in great depth, a single scene of the story.  The new cards are all based around that part of the story.

The third type of expansion is called Saga Expansions.  These are big box expansions that focus on moving the story forward.  Each Saga Expansion is actually 2 big box expansions.  Both together equal the Saga Expansion.  Each big box contains many new encounters, usually 3.  Also included are many new Heroes and cards for each color Sphere.  The new cards are all based around that part of the story.  

All 3 of those expansions in inside the game and contain player cards to aid the player.


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


There is also a fourth type of expansion called a Print on Demand.

These are Encounters only, no Heroes or player cards, and are of extreme difficulty.  These are used for tournament play.

These are great additions to the game and good for testing your deck building abilities. 


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Additionally there is a fifth type of expansion called a Nightmare Deck.

Nightmare Decks are based on each of the expansions and are simply much more difficult versions of the Encounters already available.  These are Encounters only.  No Heroes or player cards.

The game is already very difficult and the Nightmare Decks are downright harsh.

These are strictly for the experienced deck builder.

This is a fun game, but the base scenarios are very difficult to beat in solo play. In fact, I would dare say that this game can be brutal! I like this game enough that I picked up a few of the expansion packs for some new scenarios to try. I just wish I could find a few more people to play this with since most of my group gets turned off by CCG and LCG card games.

This started as a 7 for me.  Then I made my own decks and it was an 8.  Now, with the expansions out and the future I see in this game regarding both the quests and the deck-building aspects I rate it a 9.  It may reach a ten.

The 'A.I.' is tough, but the difficulty rating lets you know what you are in for.  The ability to make decks the way you want them is awesome, especially when teaming up with others and their decks.

I can see this game lasting a long time.  With packs coming out monthly, and most likely big sets every 6-7 months, the card base will grow and so will the fun.

This is an excellent game for any recovering CCG addict. It has similar feel and plays well even as a solo game. It offers a lot of variety for deckbuilding. Four different types of play which can be combined but with the penalty that the resources are spread and it's harder to get the cards played. Build a deck and try it our immediately in a solo game, great!

RATING: 10
Supports solid deckbuilding and the actual game is fun too - most decks don't seem to play themselves. The challenge is high, especially for solo, with only the first mission in the core set reasonable to complete out of the box without adding in cards from later sets. Some may not like the challenge but attempting to accomplish it for me is quite thrilling. I have not played in multiplayer yet, but the variety of outcomes by each encounter deck is sufficiently high to keep the game interesting. You can replay the same mission with the same deck many times and have very different experiences. But it definitely opens up as you expand to it and dip into deckbuilding - not recommended if you aren't interested in that aspect of the game.

I got this so I could build my deck the way I wanted it. I want a Hobbit deck. To do a Hobbit deck, it takes a LOT of seeking out and buying OP allies and attachments, but it's not a popular enough game for these to be at my FLGS as singles (or even the entire expansion packs) so it's become a chore trying to get my deck the way I want it, and Amazon can jump off a ledge. That being said - great mechanics, artwork is insane, good variety of cards.

Solo (or two player co-op) game where you're playing as a few heroes going on quests sometime after The Hobbit, but before the start of The Lord of the Rings. I've heard it's brutally difficult, but my first play was ridiculously easy...I must have done something wrong. It seemed pretty cool.

EDIT: Played it again and got beaten, but I really don't seem to get this. Not sure what I'm doing wrong, but it's just not that fun. I really wanted to like this...

Basically a co-operative TCG (which at least gets rid of the whoever-spends-the-most-money-wins aspect, but is still a turnoff).  Complexity for the sake of complexity.  Major disappointment.

Here are my problems with the game. When playing solo you're almost expected to have two decks to make use Ranged, Sentinel, etc. The LCG model is streets ahead of the CCG one but it's still expensive, and content can be hard to find. FFG's core box is on the only borderline enough -- I partially solved this by having AHLCG-style decks of 33 with no more than 2 copies per card (unfortunately the box only gives you 1 of some cards). The difficulty swings around wildly and you often have to build your deck for the scenario (luckily, still fun for me).

As you can see, my problems are mostly exterior to the gameplay itself, which is amazing. And if you love this game as I do you will work through all that other stuff. Once you've spent hours figuring out and organising your cards and building your deck, the game is fast and relentless. And punishing. My problem here is that if you don't get your engine running fast enough you will be overrun. But it doesn't really feel unfair.

The choice between this and AHLCG comes down to theme, and maybe availability. I love both in different ways.

not very accessible Narrative Co-op 

What a money pit! But I continue to gleefully throw money into it, when faced with a product as quality as this one. Such art, such comboing, such innovative use of the quest mechanic for vastly different game experiences.

At last, my competitive M:TG skills can be put to use serving the greater good! Saving all of Middle Earth! Best deck construction game out there, bar none, IMO.

I've only just completed the dwarves one (2nd cycle), so I have some great adventuring ahead. I play each one a bunch of times. My favorites so far were the river Anduin from the base set, as well as the climbing the mountain one in the dwarf cycle. Watcher in the Water story gets a special nod as well!

We picked up this game when it was released, back in 2011. The first impressions were terrible: really slow game play, to many things to consider, rules really bad written (not that they were obscure, but the information was - and still is - extremely poorly organized). We played a couple of games, and then we quit. We tried again the following year, and we quit again. During 2014, we tried again. The theme was so hugely appealing to us that we decided to enter this game in the our 2014 goals, and we forced ourselves to play more. The result was that we finally "broke the ice" and learned to love it. We played more than 100 plays between August and December 2014, so that I decided to start commenting on each of the adventures and what are the problems that could present.

Anyhoo, first of all: the game. It has a steep learning curve: basically you characters need to be exhausted to perform an action, but these actions are both questing (you send characters to the quest to score successes and progress towards the victory conditions), defending from your enemies attacks and finally attacking the enemies. So that you need to decide carefully who's supposed to do what. And clearly, you need a certain buffer of freedom since the encounter deck you play against has some bad surprises for you and you need to be prepared if something goes wrong.

But the game is also "constant": every time you play the quest X, you have to face the very same deck. This allows players to improve: you go on a quest, you discover how it's structured and what are the problems and the easy points and you can consequently alter the composition of your deck to make it more effective.

The core set comes with three different quests: A Journey through Mirkwood, Journey along the Anduin and Escape from Dol Guldur, in a rampaging difficulty scale.

[b]Quest 01 - Passage through Mirkwood[/b]

[b]The quest deck[/b]
The quest deck is created through the combination of the three following decks: Passage Through Mirkwood, Spiders of Mirkwood and Dol Guldur Orcs. So that you'll have some easy locations to explore (Mountains of Mirkwood, adding one card to the staging area after travelling but rewarding you with a "draw 5 keep 1 card after exploring", Enchanted Stream, not allowing you to draw cards, and the Necromancer's Pass, forcing you to exhaust a hero to travel there, are the most difficult locations; others have benefical effects, so really, the quest deck is easy on this side) and some very basic enemies to defeat (mostly spiders and orcs).

The quest is built upon three stages; after you pass the second one, you've to randomly select the third stage to end the quest (more stuff to explore or enemies to fight) and add a little more variety.

The quest is really easy, yet not so easy. It's a good introductory quest that should be played over and over again to understand the basics of the game (when to push on the questing phase, when to defend, when to attack, how to spend resources and stuff), and it's a good way to test new decks. It can be won in two rounds, so, when you manage to do that, you are on something.

[b]Enemy cards in detail[/b]
As said, it's easy but not so easy: there are a couple of cards that can mess up the things pretty fast (especially with a standard deck built out of the core set cards): Ungoliant Spawn has a nasty attack (5), a load of hits (9), a nasty shadow effect (+4 threat, +8 if undefended), a hideous when revealed effect (-1 Willpower to all questing characters). Not a game breaker per se, but there are some other additional difficulties (Hummerhorns, Chieftain Ufthak, the Dol Guldur beastmaster) that can be problematic, and if chained, can result in the game ending quickly. This just to say that the quest is a good quest, even tho it's on the easy side of the quest deck: you can play it several times even if you're not a noob any longer and still enjoy it.


[b]Quest 02 - Journey down the Anduin[/b]

[b]The quest deck[/b]
The quest deck is created through the combination of the following four decks: Journey down the Anduin, Sauron's Reach, Dol Guldur Orcs and Wilderlands. As expected, the difficulty of the quest rampages quite a bit. You keep on measuring yourself against the toughest orcs you met in quest 1 (Chieftain Ufthak and the Dol Guldur beastmasters) but now you have some even deadlier enemies to deal with. Hill trolls will provide quite a challenge: not only their attack is heavy (6), but they are also quite resistant to damage (3 armor, 9 hits: this means a single attack need to deal 12 damage to clear out a single troll), and when they attack they convert the excess combat damage directly into a threat increase. This means you cannot think about systematically champ blocking those dudes here, otherwise you'll lose the game for exceeding the max threat threshold. And there are two of them in the deck. Additionally, some more nastieness is coming from other enemies: Goblin Snipers (you cannot optionally engage them if there are other enemies in the staging area, plus if at the end of the round they are still in the staging area, then they automatically wound one character / player), the Marsh Adder (after resolving their attack, you have to increase your threat by 1) and some enemies featuring the "surge" keyword (after revealing those from the encounter deck, you have to reveal an additional card). Even if enemies having "surge" are kinda weak in this deck, they keep on pumping card in the staging area and this can result in some disatrous consequences, especially when stage 2 of the quest is to be resolved (see later). Locations coming with this deck are dangerous too: from the Brown Land that contributes with a +5 threat while in the staging area to the East Bight (only 1 threat, but you need 6 progress markers to pass it) to the Gladden Fields (+3 threat, 3 progress markers to pass, and at the end of the round, if it's the active location, then you have to raise your threat by 2 in stead of 1).
So, you need to pay attention to this one.


[b]Quest and strategy in detail[/b]
The quest stages' theme is really sound and well presented, with the first stage requiring you to get rid of a hill troll to reach a small raft to journey down the Anduin, the second stage where you're hunted by enemies following your tracks along the shores of the river and the final stage where you're ambushed by orcs and friends as soon as you reach the land. There are many difficult issues throughout the adventure:

- first of all, you start the quest with a hill troll in play, so that you need a) a heavy damaging combo with possibly a Feint card to elude the troll's first attack or b) a forest snare to immobilize the guy and nullify his attacks; other combos work well too (for instance, sneak attacking Gandalf or Descendant of Thorondor, or using direct damage cards to actually bypass the natural armor of the guy and start dealing quickly damage), but you need to have a plan and some cards to realize it very quickly, otherwise you can lose the quest during stage 1. Not to mention that, in case you have the second troll showing off during round 2, well, most of the times it's a good bye

- then, while journeying along the Anduin (stage 2) enemies don't engage you unless you optionally engage them (thematically, it's great: enemies cannot enter the river to battle you, but you can decide where to stop the raft and kill quickly a couple of them); this could sound fantastic, but actually it's not. For two different reasons: first of all, all the enemies in the staging area contribute to the threat you have to pass in order to place successes on the quest, and this stage of the quest requires 16 progress marker to be placed, which is rather a high number; then, as soon as you pass stage 2, you add two more cards to the staging area / player: these represent the "ambush" your enemies have prepared for you, so that if you have an overcrowded staging area, you'll be overwhelmed by enemies at this point. Even though many are easy, their mere number, and the eventual surges you had to resolve, could result in the situation slpping out of your hands. Additionally, some locations can clog the staging area even further.

So, to sum this up: you need some good combat combos, a couple of cards able to neutralize your enemies attacks for some time, a couple of good questers to move quickly through the stages of the adventure and in the end have enough allies in play to survive the horde storming on you as soon as you enter stage 3. Clearly, it's not the most difficult quest ever, but it's a real quest, that requires you to think about the deck you build and will probably require some tries to pass it.


[b]Quest 03 - Escape from Dol Guldur[/b]

[b]The encounter deck[/b]
The encounter deck is created through the combination of the following three decks: Escape from Dol Guldur, Spiders of Mirkwood and Dol Guldur Orcs. Again, the difficulty is supposed to rise a bit; not because of the quest per se (Journey down the Anduin is by far a more difficult quest), but because it's a quest with quite some different mechanics, and it requires some time to figure out how to deal with it. Anyhoo, let's look at the cards in the deck. Spiders of Mirkwood and Dol Guldur Orcs should be well known by the players because they were already used in previous quests from the core set; what's new is the Escape deck. First of all, there are many cards featuring the keyword "Doomed X": whenever a card with such a keyword is revealed, you have to raise your threat by X. Additionally, other cards have "surge" (hence, they trigger another card); in some cases ("Endless caverns"), you have both. Finally, this deck adds three brand new enemies: the Nazgul of Dol Guldur (someone you need to be ready to encounter)and the Dungeon Jailor (2 copies of him in the deck): not the strongest orc in the mix, but someone that becomes fastidious because he could (under certain circumstances) force you to reshuffle objectives (special encounters you need to control to advance through the quest) back into the deck. The new enemies are not particularly strong per se, but remember you have Chieftain Ufthak, and Ungoliant Spawn and Hummerhorns in the mix, so that if more than one of these cards is triggered at once, especially in the early steps of the game, well, winning becomes difficult.

[b]The quest[/b]
During this quest, players are asked by Galadriel to investigate in the surroundings of the tower of Dol Guldur, to find out what's going on there. While the party is approaching the tower, they got ambushed by a band of Orcs, capturing one of the Heroes and taking him prisoner to Dol Guldur. His companions need to venture inside the tower, using three items (the Shadow Key, the Dungeon Torch and Gandalf's Map) properly to find their way into the tower, rescue the lost friend and then leave before it's too late.

So that, immediately, at the beginning of the game, the three items ("Objectives") are revealed and added to the staging area, and three encounters are attached to them, representing their guardians or the places they are hidden into. Additionally, the Nazgul of Dol Guldur is placed nearby, yet not in play (for now, at least). This done, one of the Heroes is randomly selected and turned facedown, representing the prisoner, buried in some cell in Dol Guldur. The first step of the quest requires the heroes to claim one of their objectives (and place 9 progress markers on the quest) to move to stage 2. Stage 2 represents the core of the challenge: by placing at least one progress marker on the quest card, the prisoner is freed and returned to the game, but the Nazgul enters the staging area. He's strong (3 defense, 9 hit points) and with a terrific special attack (if you resolve a shadow effect while attacking with the Nazgul, you remove a character from the game); sure, you can leave him in the staging area if you're good at controlling threat, but he contributes with +5 to the total threat while questing, so that it's difficult to leave him forever. Passing to stage three requires the other two objectives to be claimed (as well as 15 progress markers) and then finally to pass stage three you need 7 progress markers and have the Nazgul defeated.

As you can see, no easy quest, with many factors to consider to find out the perfect timing for power questing / defending / attacking; additionally, remember that stages 1 and 2 forces players not to play more than 1 ally (in total, not per player!) / rounds, so that any strategy like "playing hundreds of champ blockers" simply doesn't work.

Some things to do:

- first of all, you need to quest quickly through stage one. Not too quickly, otherwise the Nazgul could become a problem, but quickly enough since the game is hard and you play with one hero less (this condition is a lot less problematic with higher player counts: 4p feels the lack on one hero not so devatasting, while playing 1p it's a matter of life and death)

- you need something to deal with the Nazgul (Feint, Forest Snare, anything disabling him from attacking too many times); direct damage cards work perfectly at this moment (sneak attacking Gandalf or Descendant of Thorondor, or using Swift Strike, or some Gondorian Spearmen, these cards here come in handy); possibly, try to eliminate the Nazgul during stage 2 of the quest, so that as soon as you reach stage 3, you can powerquest through that stage

- another thing to consider is the possibility of having location locks (i.e., too many locations in the staging area, hindering you from advancing in the quest and resulting in games lost quickly); for this reason you need some good questers and possibly at least one copy of Northern Tracker in play

Once you manage to do these things here, you have pretty decent chances to pass.

Very enjoyable play, but I would really be most interested in this as a solo game and:
1) I generally prefer solo games where you only need to play one hand, and the scenarios just don't support that much - so much of good gameplay in LOTR is dependent on getting synergy with party-members.
2) Deck-building is shockingly poorly supported in the core set, and I cannot see myself investing the kind of money needed to properly get into this game. 
Still, if my wife liked it as much as I did then I would happily jump in. The art and production values are great, to my eye.

A dull exercise in multiplayer solitaire rules interpretation. Not my type of game in any case. Not shying away from a bit of direct player conflict, my sensibilities are not so fragile that I need a co-op generic Lord of the Rings (yawn) adventure quest mislabeled as a game. While this will appeal to many, it does not rock my boat. FFG really need to think about providing a Dominion style insert for this game - especially if they're pushing so hard for me to buy three copies.

My first take on a Fantasy Flight Games' Living Card Game, with the one that I believe is the best rated here in BGG. Its mechanics are simple and work properly, but the game lacks from a "je ne sais quoi". Probably it is that the theme, despite the nice artwork and flavor texts on the cards, doesn't really integrates well with the gameplay. Everything seems artificial and pasted on, and you don't ever feel inmersed in a quest in Middle Earth, fighting for the survival of the world as you know it. Instead of that, you just find yourself adding and substracting numbers to get some chips placed over a bunch of cards. Perhaps it is only that I'm supersaturated of colaborative games, or that the fantasy setting, and particularly in Tolkien's universe, starts to feel repetitive. Maybe it is that the game doesn't grow a high level of tension, because the quests are either very easy or imposible to achieve, or perhaps is that there is nothing really innovative or engaging in the mechanics of the game. It may be that, in theory, you can develop your characters during the game adding them cards, but it ends so quickly that this possibility stays in the paper. But most likely is a sum of everything I've said and even more things that I just can barely imagine.

7/12 update - I thought I'd enjoy the puzzle aspect of putting together a deck, but you definitely need the perfect deck to be able to win some scenarios.  Turns out I don't like the idea that I can lose a game from the shuffle of the deck even if my deck is perfectly tuned...this is goin to sit on the shelf for a while...

I owned the base set and one expansion a while ago, I thought the game system was good, but needed MANY expansions for both variety of encounters and deck building options. Not wanting to commit at that time, I traded it after just a couple plays.

Now that there ARE many expansions available, I was able to trade for a lot and am enjoying it thoroughly without feeling limited or obligated as I did before.

This is a really good somewhat thematic resource management game system. It's all about risk/reward, the ability to craft a deck around specific scenario's challenge.

Best solo game I have played. Every new quest seems to require a rethinking and retooling of one's deck in order to be successful. For those who love deck building this is as good as it gets. If you don't care for deck building this may not be the game for you.

This game is so difficult to solo (in my experience). But thematically, this game is extremely well done! When you start to get behind, it genuinely feels like the forces of evil are closing in on you. I don't often win at this game. In fact...practically never. And, I happen to prefer the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game games that scratch a similar itch. AND, I can't catch up or keep up with the crazy release schedule for FFG LCGs.

Three copies.  All possess cards and components in near mint condition (the cards were sleeved while in use).  One of the boxes is in near mint condition and the other two are in good-very good condition.  Two of the inserts are present and in near mint condition.  The other insert was modified to store three rows of cards but is still perfectly functional (and in my opinion more useful than the mint ones).

My first real card game after PokÃ©mon back in 2000. 
Rulebook didn't feel very clear about the gameplay. This might have been due to my inexperience with cardgames. 

LotR - LCG is a complex game and I have the feeling that it's near unplayable if not played in easy mode. 
We might be doing something wrong though. ;) 
Since then, I've read many reviews claiming a single core-set isn't enough to get you through the game on your own, so it seems like expanding is the way to go. 

Co-op was also a new thing but the more games I played, the more interested I have become in the concept of games without player-conflict. 

Because of the difficulty, this game got shelved for a while. Now that I've become more experienced with board games in general (and Tolkien lore as well) I feel like picking this one up again. The co-op nature of the game, combined with the fact that the collection has been growing steadily makes me want to try this game more and really learn it. 

The art style of this game is superb! It's one of the things that really attracted me to the game, as the more grim style of the art felt more like the books than the movies did. 

Rating might go up, this one is based on just a single core play through. 

Includes the entire [i]Shadows of Mirkwood[/i] cycle.

RATING: 10
This game has been a big hit with us.  I usually play with my boys (ages 10 and 13) actually.  I like the game for several reasons, the game play, the lack of downtime, the art, and the play time.   The game play is engaging and requires constant attention of all players all the time.  Many moving pieces have to be accounted for when planning out your charactersâ actions, such as exploring, keeping threat low, defending, attacking, and controlling the encounter deck.  You have to balance all these needs when deciding what to allocate your characterâs limited actions to.  That requires a lot of teamwork.  The different spheres of influence have different feels and each can really contribute to adventure.  There is not much in the way of down time.  Further, the games take between 45-90 minutes (averaging about an hour), which is great for us.

The deck building aspect is fun.  It is enjoyable to try and figure out the best deck to play for the different demands in each scenario.  It is also fun trying to find good combinations of cards, both in your own deck and with other playersâ decks.  

FFG did a fantastic job with the art, capturing the Tolkien feel.  I so much prefer this sort of classic fantasy art to what is found in WoW, Warhammer, Manga, or anything like that.  My boys love the game, and one of them is constantly asking me to play.

I like the living card game model quite a bit.  I like getting new cards and scenarios regularly to keep the game fresh.  I also like that each expansion includes a complete set of fixed play cards.  There is no randomness.  I have no interest in the ccg model.

Splits the difference between a 4 and 6 rating. On the game play alone I would give it a 6. It's a bit repetitive and random but the puzzle aspects of optimizing your play each round keep it interesting. Unfortunately though, I don't care for the deck construction aspect of the game which, for a serious player, seems to be how you need to spend most of your time with the game. In that respect I would give it a 4. Deck construction is not a meta-mechanism I enjoy. I was hoping that this game might get me to see deck construction in a different light but I'm afraid it hasn't.

After about two years of playing this game, itâs time to rate it a ten. This game has some dud quests and quite a few relatively worthless cards, so it is not a âperfect tenâ. But it is a ten because it has captured me like no other game in the hobby. I love the puzzle in this game and the cohesion of two tightly built decks against some hard hitting scenarios. I do not log plays but I am probably around 70 solo plays and 20 or so with 3 players.

RATING: 8.5
summer, 2011:  Currently rating this an 8 after over a dozen plays, both solitaire and 2-player.  At first, I was a little disappointed with the "simplicity" of the game.  I just couldn't see the longevity of the system.  Build a strong deck, try and beat a published scenario, get frustrated with some bad luck, win after some good luck, get bored, wait for next expansion, repeat.  My opinion has evolved.  I am now buying a 2nd core set because I believe in the system that much.  The deck-building possibilities are not fully realized yet, but they will be - and they will be great fun.  Having new Encounter (read, Mordor) cards come out every month or so will be thoroughly exciting ("I wonder how my Leadership/Spirit deck will do against THIS expansion...").  Plus, playing 2-player really does lend itself to deep and difficult decision-making, classic risk vs. reward stuff.  A strong system.  I'll re-visit this rating in a year to see how I feel then.

winter, 2012: Upping my rating to an 8.5.  I adore this game.  Have been playing it obsessively single-player for the past 2 weeks.  Admittedly, the Mirkwood quests have been mostly lame - but the new heroes and player cards create wonderful new deck-building opportunities, and the Khazad-dum expansion brings 3 fantastic quests to the mix.  

Spring, 2014:  Into it again, and upgrading to a 9.  This is a fantastic game.  Bought the Black Riders saga set, now buying a couple more Dwarrowdelf adventure packs before I dip into Numenor.  I've probably put more hours into this game than any other on my shelf over the past 2 years.

Summer 2016:  Downgrading slightly to an 8.5.  I think I'm finally over my LoTR card game addiction.  My last time pulling it out was unsatisfying, as it felt like the scenarios were insanely difficult and I only won if my deck happened to "go off" in just the right way.  I think the power/difficulty curve of this game has just gone too far for solitaire players.  If I played 2 player consistently, I would still dig it.  But for now, I'm retiring my collection.

I bought this game for solo. This game is very difficult, I would say some scenario are impossible with just the core set. I bought two saga expansions but the number of cards added is really just like a handful of cards in triplicate. It wasn't very game changing. I hate the fact that I cannot play the characters I want. I have to tailor every specific thing in the deck just to have a chance at beating the scenario. Then I have to do it again for the next scenario. I guess I wanted more of a rpg experience. I rated a 4 because this game is absolutely maddening.

A friend's copy with some expansions included. We played 2 decks he put together. 

As far as co-ops go it works. The fact the everybody has their own deck means that while you're working together and deciding on objectives, each is playing their own game and deciding how to meet those objectives. This was quite neat. 

Theme works. Not a huge fan of co-ops or LCGs as a product idea, but this was neat. Co-op with deck building? (in traditional CCG sense) Why not. 

Edit - not interested in playing it again (co-ops not my thing) and this one is a money sink as well. Whatever. Hence rating 2.0 (will not play again)

Edit - meh, why does this need to exist? (when I ask this question it means the game gets 1.0 rating) LCG the co-op whoop dee doo. Bollocks.

Provisional rating.

I'm not sure if I'm missing something but the game is highly uninvolved and merely an exercise in game mechanics. Draw cards, play cards, use heroes and other cards to deal with enemies and work your way through the deck. Rinse and repeat.

Can you truly call this a co-op game if it's mostly multiplayer solitaire?

The artwork is great but if the mechanics doesn't lend itself to the theme, what's the point?

As is typical of some FFG games, the base game isn't enough to give you longevity (three quests? Come on, would it hurt to add another 9 cards for six quests in total??!) and you'll need to either buy a second base set and expansion packs in order to expand your gaming experience. For example, Dominion and Race for the Galaxy offers better card-gaming bang for buck.

Will clock a few more plays before finalising review.

Update:

The steps of the game feels very clunky and procedural.

While I understand the 'tactics' behind combat (defending and attacking), it would seem more elegant to have combat as one fluid step, with damage resolved simultaneously ala MtG.

The game just gets bogged down in its mechanics: card flipping, token placement etc. If you want a game that captures the LoTR feel and spirit, look elsewhere (try the first CCG or even the Decipher CCG).

Coop game that has way too many rules for its own sake, unless you really really are into Lord of the Rings. Tons and tons of scenarios, including custom ones, but I still think it's more thematic than playable.

RATING: N/A
This is an easy 10. love solo games, love playing games with 1 other (usually my wife), and love Tolkien! This game goes up to 11 since it is also made by FFG. Don't touch it. Don't even look at it. One small thing, that is a personal nerd-choice rather than criticism, is that i LOVE the way Gandalf is a passing ally, who appears, drops some pain, and disappears. I would've loved the game up to a 12 if this was the case with all of the main book characters, and the heroes you play were some back benchers. Would've given it more of a "this is my character in Middle Earth" kinda feel.
EDIT: erased my 10 rating. don't really want 1-off quests, wanted to get to a "persistent level-uppy-type" extended campaign right away, and it looks like too much of a money investment to get to that point. game still feels really well made, and the art is top notch, so i didn't want to drop my rating, just personally can't get into this.

I've bought two base sets and the first two expansion sets (main set plus adventure packs). I plan to get them all. Great solo game. Basically scratches the Android: Netrunner itch, but you don't need a partner.
Why not a 10? Well, there are some scenarios that I don't like much, that force you into a certain strategy or tactics that aren't to my liking. Some scenarios are set up so that you *must* get lucky in some way in order to have any chance.
But those are infrequent. Most scenarios are enjoyable and provide a great variety of experiences.

It's a tough game when played solo (as one player, rather than managing multiple hands) but I can see this getting an awful lot of plays over the coming years....

Nice-looking cards and some devious mechanics...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't like the questing mechanic, as players tend to math out their willpower commitment. It boils down to a game of resource allocation, often making me forget that I am playing a Lord of the Rings game. I also don't like that each game starts out difficult and gets progressively easier, which is sometimes counteracted by having the players draw a stupid amount of encounter cards that deal random damage. Also defending with only one character, which is then exhausted without being able to do something, and then attacking back with different characters is a strange way to represent combat.

This game is also extremely luck based. In a 2-player game, you are drawing from three decks (the two player decks and the encounter deck), hoping that you're not getting crushed by too many monsters / treachery cards / locations. The shadow effect cards add a big deal to the randomness by sometimes having no effect but sometimes killing your firstborn. The location cards do nothing more than lengthening the playtime, showing a beautiful drawing with a completely unrelated travel effect that is there to annoy you.

Oh, and three scenarios in the base game (from which one  sucks and one is incredibly difficult) are not enough. I hate being forced to buy those stupid Adventure Packs for additional scenarios, when I am not particularly interested in deckbuilding. (Un)fortunately, it seems that I'm immune to this supposedly addictive CCG-like business model.

Overall this game is a big disappointment.

Played a few games after my friend picked it up.  First game was misleading because we played it terribly wrong and got crushed. 2nd game was pretty fun after we got some key rules sorted (both being able to do things each turn not his turn then my turn etc).  

Interested in playing more, was fun.  Not sure if need to get my own copy to have my own deck too yet.

I keep buying the expansions but I still can't decide if I like it, and nobody ever wants to play it, so it's a pure solo game so far.  

I wonder if eBaying it and buying the probably identical Star Wars game will work better.  Loads of people will play Star Wars, but think LOTR is crap.

I think it's the goblins. Anything with goblins is "sad".

Gorgeous artwork. Love the theme. Big fan of the LOTR. Also, we enjoy the idea of MTG-like interactions and combos. That said, these elements never really came together cohesively. The game play is clunky and uninspired. Deck building requires financial and time commitment (base game is thin on content). Not really for us, but may play with fans of the LOTR just for kicks.

Though I'm wary of deckbuilding, this is the game I played the most by now. Great solitaire (often controlling 2 players, so I get to deck-build and play with all spheres) and so many intertwined levers to pull and knobs to turn to influence gameplay and deck-building (threat-wounds-card-power-questing-combat). And then, it's set in Middle-Earth, with decent enough story-lines that don't wander too far off the spirit of JRR.

Procedural number allocation puzzle.  The paper thin theme exposes just how managerial the whole thing is, you might as well be allocating employees to odd jobs.  Where your "decisions" are based on sending them on gigs that they are best suited to be hired for.  In LotR:TCG if your employee, I mean, ally is good at questing, but nothing else, it doesn't take a CEO of a fortune 500 fantasy company to know that you should send them out to quest.

When you do get to actually use characters, their powers can be fun, but there are some obnoxious cards in the deck that cripple your powers.  I never understand why designers think it is a good idea to strip the fun bits out of your game.  It's like how every once in a while some schlub comic book writer thinks they are a genius by taking their superheroes powers away.  Yay.

For a game that is supposedly theme driven there is no story here, either thematically or within the game.  There is little difference between the beginning, the middle, and the end other than the order of particular cards that had come out.  Mostly, you do the same allocation over and over again.  The game works just fine, but it doesn't seem to need you as a player to be a participant, the choices seem to play themselves. Blech.

Good game but i don't score it higher because to really enjoy it you would need to buy the base game (at least) twice. As a gamer on a budget that's a no go. Also, like any LCG, make sure you get enough expansion to really build the deck you want. You'll be stuck otherwise :)

Wow..That sums up what I want to say about this game. I've always been a fan of card games, and of course, I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings universe.  When the new game was announced, I was immediately interested, but wondered if it would be as good and in depth as previous card games (I was heavily into the Lord of the Rings trading card game).

To my relief the Lord of the Rings The Card Game satisfied.  It's challenging, it's coop, it's got deck building, it's got strategies and you're always faced with tough decisions.

As Drakkenstrike said, it accomplishes the task of emotionally attaching itself to you in the same way that the Lord of the Rings trading card game did.

RATING: 8
I'm convinced...this is the new Thunderstone for me in terms of a strong desire to buy up all the cards I can.  This is a fantastic coop game; deep, very evocative, and tense.  Difficulty 4 on the 2nd Scenario has proved to be difficult indeed with the starter decks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The most thematic Lord of the Rings game that I have ever played in any format.
   If you do not like constructing decks then this game is probably not for you but for any other gaming LOTR book fan it's a must with loads of strategy but it does take time to construct a theme deck once you have built up a good collection of cards.

I really wanted to like this one, and it's not bad, but it's widely considered among the fanbase that some scenarios are next to impossible playing solo (check FFG forums).  I witnessed this first-hand wasting my time trying some of them.  River Down the Anduin, for example, you can only win by luck when playing solo.  That is pathetic, and really ruined the game for me.

It is unfortunate. Unlike Android Netrunner this game is not ready to play out of the box. If you want to play three and four players you will need to buy another set for counters. Then unless you are a phenom, you will need to purchase some expansions to make the second and third starter games/campaigns more manageable.

I like the game overall but am personally not willing to spend money. You will love it if you are a fan of the mythos and willing to invest in it.

RATING: 10
A remarkably deep game in many aspects. 

First off, there is significant strategy even before you start playing, in determining the construction of your deck and the heroes to use with it. Which sphere(s) of influence will work best with this scenario? What did I do wrong last time with my deck that I can improve this time? What will work best with the heroes I've chosen? 

It's incredibly fun just sitting back and deciding how to assemble the optimal deck, and we haven't even involved actual game play yet. In fact, what makes this game so interesting is there are pretty much two game "modes" to it.... the first is the deck-building mode, the second is the game mode. Both are very fun in their own ways.

Now for the actual gameplay.... for a card-based co-op, there is a LOT to this game, both in depth and variety. Multiple scenarios, lots of difficult decisions, and lots of unexpected wrinkles thrown at the player. Do I exhaust this character to travel and maintain the threat level, or do I hang back this turn and try to finally vanquish this spider gnawing on us, delaying the journey and raising the threat? Should I sacrifice an ally to keep my heroes healthy? Should I spend my resources on this weapon here, or this other ally here, or save up for Gandalf next turn because I REALLY need to lower my threat level....

This has to be my best purchase of the year, and I know this game will get LOTS of play time.

Great solo game, whether playing single or two-handed. I enjoy the deck-building aspect, tweaking decks against scenarios as necessary.

I am stunned! I did not expect this game to be so good. Tons of cards, outstanding artwork, and quality components (all typical FF top notch production). The mechanics make this game so special. It is filled with TOUGH decisions, crazy tension, and great challenge. Could it be the best Rings game ever?  We will determine that after more plays. It seems certain it will be the most in depth exploration of Middle-Earth by Fantasy Flight. Awesome!

The first FFG card game that actually makes sense to me and makes me want to continue to play it.  Many folks have bashed just the base set to me, but honestly I have enjoyed my four solo plays very much.  Perhaps it's the theme, but the game works and has already provided some exciting moments!  *Update* - now that I am playing this with my 8-year-old son and building decks, it is one of my favorite games to play. *Another update* - Staying power was a problem for me, as I feel like I don't want to invest anymore into new decks and strategies.  The original game plus a few expansions seems about right for my level of interest.

A BLAST. Love this game, but it does suffer from the fact that it is really hard to get to the table (for me).

So, I really just play it Solo - but it is soooo good solo that I absolutely love it. And the artwork is stunning.

While clearly not a bad game, this just wasn't the game for me. Too much trial and error deck building made me feel less like a hero and more like a nerd who had repeatedly failed and learned what the game wanted me to do in a very linear way. The complete opposite of a sandbox experience. 

So many people look online for what decks to use. What is the point in that? The whole fun of the game is working out what works and what doesn't! If you deck build with decks that will win of course you'll be 'good' at the game because there's no skill needed past the point of preparing a deck.

I've been interested in this in a while.  Solo play,  combined play, either or!  If I like it I might get an expansion or two down the road.

After looking through the manual though, I mildly regret the trade.  LOTR looks GREAT as a game.  I'll have to re-acquire it one day.

After the first play I fell in love with it. It scratches the itch from Magic the Gathering I've had for years now. Building your decks, customizing your adventure, your experience.

Love this as a solo game and also surprisingly well played as a 2p game. Admittedly it seems tough at first and building a deck is not that easy with limited cardpool, but I guess that will go away when I get some expansions into account.

For a 1 hour game it brings a great storytelling, engaging gameplay, tough choices, deck construction and great tension. I never feel like I'm bored while playing.

Also love the artwork and am a fan of Tolkien's work, so I absolutely love this game.

Based on ten solitaire game think it will be much much better as a co-op. V easy to play, well worn CCG mechanics against a system driven enemy.

Now played multi player and and just longer and more complicated. The interactions between players decks was interesting up to a point however it just feels like a more convoluted Pandemic - i.e its a reseting puzzle with loads of minute text on cards and the name of the game is using these details to solve a puzzle. If you like this kind of thing fine but to me its a lot of effort to defeat a random deck of cards - at least in DOTR there is a board, side quests and lots of minis to create some atmosphere. In Arkham you can choose which random part you'd like to chance - here its just straight off the top of the deck

Lots to admire and an admirable solo/coop version of a CCG. However, my 10 games (ceteribus paribas) have come down to the luck of the draw.

Even in a co-op this will be the case - though the ability of the players to make bad choices will add variability. Unless theres something great in the expansions i probably wont be playing this much further

I wonder why this was not implemented as player v player taking it in turns to be the bad guys? Please FF don't give this treatment to Star Wars LCG!


I hope the co-op side makes the game shine, otherwise why not play a computer game?

This will be interesting to see how it develops, especially the deck building side as I feel this was a very poor start. It needed more scenarios and also some multi mana decks out of the box

Oh man, i am hooked on this game. 
It begins with the pre-fun by building a deck based on a scenario and figuring out how to approach the deck building. 

Just picking an deck ability , trait or sphere to build the deck from and then setting up the deck. 

And then come the enjoyment of playing the deck and testing it out. Re-adjusting it in the next play and before you know it, lots of time past away.

Enjoying the game. Not liking the spirit deck, with its ability to delay attacks and recycle the deck.  Not liking Tactics solo, with its inability to make progress on quests.  So far the melding of the two decks has not worked well.

RATING: 7
I enjoy it, but you need to be aware that the game has randomness that you need to be prepared for. With the core set I think this is not always possible and it can quickly leave you in a position you have literally no way out of. This can be frustrating but if you get right back into it (shuffling the encounter deck well!) then you will find satisfaction again.

I am put off by the huge amount of expansions - it is simply too expensive to get into deck building for me - that is one part of the game I won't be experiencing sadly.

Just didnât draw me in. Had read so much about itâs theme, but in the end I got very little feeling for it. Mostly felt like I had to buy everything to get enough useful cards, and the quests didnât make me want to pull them mout and get everything togeterh. And I really wanted to like this game!!

Should note that I only have tried to play it solo and single handed. PLaying solo with two hands never had any appeal to me.

Only a few plays until now (with a friend's copy; got the game for christmas), but the integration of the theme is so well done and the coop mechanics so engaging that it might quickly become a favorite. Update 06-24-2016 : With a few more games in, the cogs of the game start to disappear and concede the stage to the adventure. Every game is a story of cruel choices and dire consequences. And winning. Winning becomes meaningful again with the LotR LCG.

EDIT 2017-04-10 : Many more plays now (very few have been logged though), with much more to come. This game is like a good red wine, the more it ages, the better it becomes. The new cards and mechanics added with every new cycle keep the game fresh while also building on its solid foundations. You want a card game to last you a very long time ? Here it is. Just want to try the core box and enjoy it without having to buy a gazillion expansions ? Look for Ninjadorg's 6 quests here on BGG. They should be included in the box. They are THAT good.

RATING: 6
Update.  Ok the game is absolutely worthless solo playing right out of the box with any of the decks.  Frustrating and stupid, but with nice, if frequently recycled, art.  Where the game shines is once you start trying to customize the decks to account for what you've seen in the scenarios (by failing horribly).  And especially once you start being able to build lots more variations as you add expansions.  Based on this I have to say the game design is terrible, not because there's not a pretty good game in there, but because it will have limited appeal as people buy the game and are disgusted with the stupid arbitrary mess--your decisions will be worthless in working toward the end-goal, and your only hope is that the scenarios cards come up just right...nothing is in your control.  The first people buying the game were mostly deck-constructors who were familiar with the normal FFG LCGs.  They were very comfortable jumping immediately into creating their own decks when they saw issues in the first scenario.  As more people bought into the glowing reviews, the more of these that went immediately onto trade lists and into math trades because the game (and the rulebook) didn't prepare them for the real process of the game.  Now this is mitigated almost completely by playing two players since you then have a good mix of character abilities even within the confines of the pre-packaged decks.  Anyone playing two players to start with would be surprised by how little control a solo player has with a pre-packaged deck.

So I'm going to leave the rating the same, with the caveat that the game is much better if you're willing and able to put in the time to construct your own decks (and use at least 3 gandalfs).  And it gets much MUCH better if you construct your own decks AND also buy at least a couple of the expansion packs for more building variety.

Upshot is 6 for most non-CCG players (and that's even a bit high probably)
7 for anyone comfortable with deck construction
8 for a deck constructor willing to spend another $25 for a couple more expansions.

preliminary rating based on just a couple solo plays with just the base set.  This game is painfully random.  It *may* work better if you mix a couple decks, but it seems like that might also dilute the resource acquisition too much.  The Tactics deck is fundamentally broken played by itself--unless your draws from the encounter deck are extremely lucky, you have so little willpower that a win is impossible.  Now, I was just playing a single Gandalf card in the deck (as per the rules) but maybe you can have up to 3 per the tournament deck building rules?

Anyway, I tried both the tactics and the spirit deck and neither worked--the spirit deck got close, as I had just a single token left to get to complete the final quest card, but a single bad shadow card took away one of my ally cards, which left an attacker undefended, which killed my final hero.

I'll give it a few more play throughs and adjust my rating accordingly if it continues to feel excessively random, or if it feels like a player's decisions actually have some bearing on the outcome.

If it weren't for the theme which I love, it would be rated even lower and auctioned or traded immediately

Disappointing. I played only once and this game may not be the best one, but due to heavy randomness and dull mechanics I doubt if I'll play again.

  EDIT-After more solo and 2 player games, this game has only gotten better. I was especally surprised by the depth of possible combinations and the interactions with multiple playings, would like to have more regular expansion releases. 
SECOND EDIT--I have played through all the quests in the Return To Mirkwood Cycle and the game has not gotten stale or overpowered. The old cards from the core set are still heavily used, and evey new expansion injects fresh ideas and combinations into the system. To me the game is at the right balance--I usually win about 50% of the time with the right decks. How many games out there are just as fun solo as multi-player? This is only the second game I have ever rated a 10.

Good game, but the choices are often too obvious. Pair the purple and red in the first deck and the other player select the best cards from the green and blue. The base box is relatively easy to finish, and the replayability fails. By purchasing expansion boxes, you can extend the limitations, but I don't feel that the quests provide the similar fun when replaying. I like the LotR theme, but this game disappointed me, I expected much more. The Android: Netrunner core box has the same price tag and simply overwhelms this game regarding fun and replayability. As for a cooperative game, I suggest another one.

This game has a steep learning curve. In the beginning I was losing half a dozen games in a row before logging my first win.
But this is good!
Because otherwise I would not have been motivated to play the game as often as I have done.
With time you get to learn the strengths and weaknesses of the different strategies. Deck-building is absolutely required and provides as much fun as playing the actual game.
What I really like about the design is the fact that the scenarios require different solutions every time. A deck that works for one scenario is horrible versus another.

LotR the Card Game has many parallels to Magic: the Gathering. The most notable difference, though, is that it is cooperative/solitaire. If you are a die-hard M:tG tournament player this might turn you off. But if you just like the deck-building and the Tolkien atmosphere you can't do better than this.

I had long ago sworn off CCG's, but this LCG is a bit different and it plays well. Superb artwork, too.

Very good theme and atmosphere, fairly engaging gameplay. AI provides a very challenging enemy - more involved then what appears at first glance.

The core set feels a bit cramped, and it didn't quite hold my interest as I had hoped it would.

Having now played several games co-op and solo, I definitely prefer the co-op game; solitaire is just so-so.

[Update] The game just doesn't resonate with me like I had hoped. It's just not getting the table time that I thought it would, feeling more like an exercise than a fun game that I should be looking forward to playing.

After 400 plays, this is one of my favourite games. It is not at the top because it can be a little frustrating sometimes. But with all of the expansions so far to date and with more to come, it offers so much (re)playability. Both in the individual quests, but in the deck building as well.

Interesting design that does capture some of the feel of LotR. However, the game feels overly mechanistic and formulaic.

One of the best games I own.  The only things stopping me from getting more into it are the time it takes to do the deck building and the money it takes to really invest in this system.

For the time being I am going to try to Hobbit Saga Expansions and see if my interest holds.

I just love the depth of the decisions that have to be made, the options the spheres open up, and the variety the scenarios offer. I have realized that games without scenarios feel very samey to me after a few plays.  The scenarios and being able to try different decks against them is a major plus for me.

Love the artwork and the flavor text as well.

Great great great great game. Swapped a spare copy of Dungeon Petz for it as something I can play solo and has not disappointed so far. Exhausting to build a deck though so a playthrough for me is usually broken up into 2 sessions. 1 to build a deck and the following night to run it. Time consuming but still a very good game. Can't recommend it enough.

UPDATE: Despite all the flaws (below), I am really enamored by the simple idea of a singleplayer LCG. You got me FFG. 

The core engine of the game is fine, and is actually quite interesting. However there is something off in the way resources are generated because a lot of the cards are priced all weird. I don't know if that's a lack of playtesting, or if it's some lame attempt to promote deckbuilding by including a lot of bad cards in the starter. There's a good game in here, now let me just drop $100 on expansions so I can find it. Haha. NOT

I was sure that I was not going to like this game.  But I also said that about Magic and Warcraft!  Turns out that I was wrong.  There's tons of things to like about this game.  Building synergy in a deck is really important and I think that creates lots of fun.  The chapter packs offer so much variety and choice that I don't see this game getting old any time soon.  I really NEED to get this one sooner rather than later.

Gift from Magnus & Susanna. They played it once and didn't like it...?
It's a bad game. LotR is a great setting for a game and the designers could have made soooo much with it. They didn't. Game mechanics are dull and boring. Cards are average at best, most are dull and boring (again). It's super clear that Fantasy Flight only has one objective: they want us to buy endless amounts of extra stuff. You need two core boxes if you want to play with more than two players. You only get three intro scenarios in the core box. All is just prepped for us to spend loads of money on expansions (and there are more than 100 listed here on BGG). I hate games that require expansions to be played properly. I might just buy a few anyway, just to see if the game gets better. But until I do, my score will stay at three. With the core box only, it barely qualifies as a game.

I love this game. Great art, solid mechanic, LCG > CCG, etc. Maybe I'm just being a girl here, but the problem with this game is that too many of the missions are so damn hard that we never play them because it's no fun just getting annihilated by the deck every time. So once we got tired of the easier missions, the game went up on the shelf, lonely and abandoned.

This game is no longer a 'game'... it's a hobby, a lifestyle and a passion (frustrations and all).

I was never a fan of the turn structure, I felt for such a thematic game, there was a lot of common sense disconnects.

I play this solo "double fisted" - I play for two players. It's a fun puzzle with a sense of progression as you go through the campaigns. When in the right mood, I enjoy building a new deck. I like how the designers represent theme with mechanics. The shadow cards add just the right amount of randomness to the combat. Some treachery cards are too punishing, requiring Spirit and treachery cancellation in all deck combinations, but it does add to the tension. I quite enjoy this game.

Epic LCG. Really captures the atmosphere of LOTR. The game has a steep learning curve, but once you bite your way through the rules, it's a marvelous game. I truly enjoy it. Being a LCG, there is a lot of content to keep up with... And I need to get better at deck construction... That's the only downside (for me) about this game: it takes some effort to construct deck before you can even start playing.

RATING: 6
Ah, the return of puzzles disguised as games! This felt exceptionally dry and whilst I can understand the purpose of 'questing' - to reduce the number of characters you have available and limit you from being able to build a massive army - it might be the least interesting thing I've ever done in a game.

I suspect that mixing the decks is the most interesting way to play. I hope it is as it was pretty dull playing with the starter sets.

Update: It *is* more interesting with mixed decks, and possibly easier too. We replayed the first 2 scenarios, that we'd lost so badly first time out and seemed to win both fairly easily. Questing is still boring and a really uninspired way to reduce the number of characters in play each round, but the game felt a lot more involved, as though the choices we'd made were actually having an impact on the outcome.

The shadow deck, whilst a good idea, is poorly implemented in scenarios where you have to kill a specific character, since that card can keep getting used as a shadows card and thus *never* come up, making the mission entirely impossible. That's pretty poor; why not just supply a separate shadow deck??

Rating up from 5 to 6.

Nice art and components. The game is nice, but luck is a major factor. Half (or more) of the game consists in making your own deck: in fact, with the predefined decks you could only win in the easiest (introductory) mission.

Unfortunately, the game doesn't really have any replayability. It comes with 3 missions: one is extremely easy, one is OK and the last one is extremely difficult (I would say almost impossible with 1 player, very very hard with 2). One you've completed 3 or 4 times the second mission (the only funny one), the game is over, you need some expansion.

Sure, if you buy expansions you can buy some hours more... but that isn't replayability. Each set of cards is burned in less than 5 hours. It doesn't pay off.

Other issues: the game doesn't really scale well with the players. With one copy of the game you can only play with 1 or 2 persons, but with one is clearly harder than with 2. If you have 2 copies, you can play with 3, but then it gets much easier.

Also, it isn't clearer how you can modify the difficulty level.

This one is slowly tailing off for me... The first few times I played it I would have rated a 10, but it's been dropping down as it's gotten too bloated for me to get back to the table. There's just too much content for the deck-building unless you are actively playing this game several times a month.

I tried to play this solo from the core and had no idea what to make of it. I'm pretty sure I understood the rules but it just seems like it's too convoluted just for the sake of emulating the characteristics of an adventure. I could see where the mechanics were going and how they worked with the concept; it's just that following them there seemed like a chore. I quit about halfway through.

Never mind the fact that this game is also an LCG with deck construction recommended. I'm not convinced that this game is worth the amount of time that it takes up in-session, never mind the additional investment of deck tuning.

Playing solo is reasonably enjoyable, but not enough for me to keep buying expansions.  I don't find myself wanting to re-play them and $10-$15 for an hour or two of play is just not a good value.  Playing with a friend might be better, especially if they are willing to share the burden of costs.

I've enjoyed the Call of Cthulhu LCG as well, but this is far better straight from the box. I admit that some of my love is based on it being new, but I found this quite a bit of fun on the first play and played again almost immediately. I don't yet feel the need for the adventure packs, but I like this game well enough that I'll certainly buy them. I may update my rating later, but right now it is at the top.

RATING: 9
I'm impressed with how simple the cards are so far, compared to other LCGs.  I'm sure a few cycles down the line, cards will get more complex, but until then there is a good card base where cards are easy to understand.

Not sure how I feel about deck building though;  this seems like another game where decks build themselves.  If you want a Rohan deck, throw everything that says "Rohan" on it into the deck.  If you want an Eagle deck, ditto.

I'm also a little turned off by overpowered combos, but I have no problem avoiding them since it's a co-op game!  So far my random-deck variant is quite enjoyable and cuts out the requirement of building a deck before playing.

Still trying to get the game down to the supposed 60 minute playtime.  When I rush, I tend to forget important card effects, but sometimes the game can drag on a bit when you feel like every round is the same (you'll typically commit the same characters to questing every single round).

This might be the adventure game to stay in my collection!

Very good game, quite addictive if you like solo play and/or cooperative play.
The thematic of LOTR is always present and the cards fit just perfectly the universe. If you are a LOTR fan and a card game fan, well this one is for you ;-)

With the growing number of expansions, deck building possibilities becomes infinite and the challenge never ends !

The only negative point is about the rules of the game. The global mechanics is fine, but it's just that some card or rules might sometime be ambiguous, which forces you to often check FAQ's or to ask in forums. But don't worry, there is a lot of LOTR lcg veteran in the BGG forum and they always kindly answer any question you might have ;-)

I was really ready to love this game. Middle Earth theme, nice artwork, and I love the concept of CCGs. Unfortunately the game just doesn't quite work. There's only so much customization you can do right out of the box due to the quantities of cards, and the game goes by so quickly that it's not really atmospheric. Maybe after some expansions come out I'll try it again and see if it gets better.

The core set by itself is not a good game and has minimal replay value.  But, after you start adding expansions and get into deck construction it really goes to another level.  Comparable to Magic the Gathering, but playable as solo, much less expensive, and has richer deck construction.

Hard to rate. It has good mechanics, is pretty thematic for this kind of game and is fun. However, the core set imo is pretty limited. FFG's other LCG's offer much more with just a core set. Second. I'm unsure about the LCG-Format in general for this game I think that  cardgame + big expansion would work better here. Well, future will show that. 

If you are looking for a good solo/2player coop, like deckbuilding and plan on buying some of the coming packs, feel free to add 2-3 points to my rating ;)

RATING: 7
Rating based on a couple of two-player plays with the core set only. I liked this, but it's far more complex than other games in Fantasy Flight's living card game line, such as Call of Cthulhu or Warhammer Invasion, to the point of being a bit fiddly at times. I can see how following the progression of the adventure packs and tweaking your deck as you go could be pretty interesting, but I'm not willing to invest that much time or effort into this. I have enough cards to make a few interesting decks and will try this out with three or four players to see where this shakes out in my ratings. Update: This is definitely better with more players, and the replay value is incredibly high. A very solid game.

[-]Preliminary[/-] rating for a game that, as of now, seems impossible to defeat. I tried all decks separately now, but with none I came really close to victory. And if that's a toughness of 1, I don't want to know what toughness 4 or 7 means. I didn't play with the variant to neglect the shadow cards, but where's the fun in that? And also I doubt that would make the game any easier. If you play with the shadow-cards you can get lucky (one of the many times you have to rely on luck of the draw) to draw cards without a shadow-effect thus discarding them without them doing the harm to you they would have done as if it was a draw for the "Aufmarschzone". What really bugs me, is that you have to decide which of your characters quest, defend or attack, but the monsters do it all at once (well, they do two the three). In the "Aufmarschzone" they put a handicap on you advancing in the quest and still they have their defense values applied, even if you're happy enough to be able to attack them there (with a hero like Dunhere or maybe other cards)and once they engage you, both their defense and attack values count. And every measly forest spider is stronger than or equally strong to one of your few heroes. Also I dislike that you have to send your heroes on a quest before you draw a new card/new cards into the "Aufmarschzone". I appreciate that mechanism from a thematical point of view, sending your heroes and allies out into the wild unknown with dangers lurking out there you have no clue about yet. But in this particular case, where it seems like a fight against all odds, it turns me down even further. 
As of now the game seems unbalanced for the good of the game. It's frustratingly difficult so far.Basically you hope to get the right cards on the right time (getting only one card per turn is kind of irksome) while at the same time you have to hope the darkness draws a card/cards that don't seem fit. I'll see how it plays with two though and check again for my rating.
-------
Wheeeew- finally after the tenth game the first victory. I don't know if that's the kind of challenge I want.Especially since the victory was only a matter of luck. I drew Ungolianths brood as a shadow card. The effect of that wasn't nearly as devastating as having to fight her along with other spiders.  
-------
 Tried with two players now. It doesn't change a bit. This game feels like a video rpg in which you have to make your way to the supertough superboss about half an hour without the possibility to save the game. It's that frustrating, it's that hard. At no time during our session we felt like we were ever able to win this. I feel the the prebuilt decks aren't balanced enough, because there wasn't much we could have done different. It's all about when you draw what cards and what cards are drawn by the shadows. And I don't have much desire to be smoked by the game again, hence the lowered rating

Cooperative play failed with my group: too much mathematics involved with 4 players, and too swingy in results. As a solo experience it's alright, but very difficult. I find it's far too much work to make a custom deck for every quest, which you really need to do to beat most quests.

RATING: 10
So maybe I didn't quite get this game the first time around. I originally had some comments about it being too mechanical and not fun. After playing (and loving) Warhammer Quest: Adventure Card Game, I decided to revisit this game because of its similarities.

Well, the game is good. Like any LCG, it takes a little bit of work to get into, but the system is really pretty simple once you learn it. You generate some resources, put some cards into play, bring out some enemies and have combat, then do a cleanup phase and start it all over.

The solo game isn't bad, but the game seems best with two. That way, instead of trying to do everything with one deck, you can build two decks that complement each other.

Picked this up, very hesistant as I truly dislike the LCG Call of Cthulhu by FFG.  This was  a HUGE surprise, had it a few days and I make a point for it to hit the table daily.  I've only played solo adventures, but I can't get enough.

I think you will eventually need/want to get expansions for this. Frankly, its kind of addictive.
But the investment adds up (money, I mean), so be ready to commit. 

One thing I have liked but have not had the chance to do more with is that the newest expansions use more magic than previously.

Great art, diversity, creative quests, never a cake-walk. 

It's not a portable game unless you set out the deck you have built and just bring a single adventure with you (say when traveling).

You need to know deck building so if that's not your thing you'll get smashed because the game is hard with a capital "H."

Different quests introduce conditions that are at once fun, but on the other hand bulky. Sometimes I forget to enact an action for a turn or two and by then its too late to take moves back. Always makes me feel like I've wasted the game, and thus the time I've put into setting it up (mind you, once it is set up for a game it is easily re-set).

I could continue to invest but I've decided not to. I even have Adventure Packs, and some quests that I have never played. That means I have some card type I have also never seen (enemies, locations and so on).  

I've enjoyed the game but it's time for me to say farewell.

Good about the game: Small footprint.
Not good about the game: Complexity ramps up very quickly with each expansion.

I played this once with three others who were very deep into the system and story line. One of them is very into the game and the story, so he tried to explain everything to me and it was a bit overwhelming. The game is very well developed, but I don't think it's for me in the end. This is party because I avoid getting interested in any kind of CCG or LCG. I see them as a money trap, and I don't want to get my leg snapped. :)

RATING: 10
I'm not a fan of LOTR nor am I a CCG player, so I'm not exactly the core demographic for this game. However, I'm really enjoying this game so far - I've only played the initial scenario solitaire with each of the starter decks. I'm looking forward to the remaining scenarios (even if they're harder) and expect I'll end up getting the expansions. Initial rating of 8.

10 plays: I can relate to all the comments and reviews regarding the difficulty of playing the second and third scenarios solitaire using monosphere starter decks out of the box - it's almost impossible to win. After winning 3 of my first 4 games solitaire against the initial scenario, I haven't won a game since. I'm not yet into deckbuilding, especially since this will be limited by the cards in the core set, but am contemplating playing two decks solitaire, as the game really seems to be designed for two players. Stays at 8.

20 plays: Still playing the core set, but have moved to "double fisting" solitaire. This is a more satisfying way to play using the core set and I've actually managed to win the second scenario. I've bought the first two expansions: [i]The Hunt for Gollum[/i] and [i]Conflict at the Carrock[/i] but am still concentrating on the core set for the time being. Stays at 8.

30 plays: Have finished all quests in the core set using all combinations of monosphere decks ("double fisting") and have now started playing through [i]The Hunt for Gollum[/i]. Stays at 8.

40 plays: Have just beaten [i]Conflict at the Carrock[/i] for the first time double fisting a Tactics and Lore deck. Looking forward to the rest of the [i]Shadows Over Mirkwood[/i] cycle and the upcoming [i]Khazad- DÃ»m[/i] expansion. Stays at 8.

50 plays: Have now played through the first four adventure packs. Whether the game goes to a 9 is likely to depend upon the greater variety and deckbuilding possibilities from future cards and whether new quests can keep the game fresh. Stays at 8.

60 plays: Have now played all [i]Shadows Over Mirkwood[/i] scenario packs. Thoroughly enjoying anticipating what's in store and listening to the [i]Cardboard of the Rings[/i] podcast. You guys rock! Rating increased to 9.

70 plays: Have started on [i]Khazad-DÃ»m[/i]. The ongoing release of scenarios is keeping the game fresh. Stays at 9.

80 plays: Have played through [i]Khazad-DÃ»m[/i] without much success. Will soon be starting on the [i]Dwarrowdelf[/i] cycle. Currently batting at 0.325. Stays at 9.

90 plays: Have now played through the first three [i]Dwarrowdelf[/i] adventure packs most recently culminating in a lucky win against [i]Watcher in the Water[/i] by correctly guessing the password for the Doors of Durin at the first attempt. Batting at 0.322. Stays at 9.

100 plays: Have reached the 100 game milestone and am still exploring possibilities with (and variants of) this game whilst still only scratching the deck building surface. Rating increased to 10!

150 plays: Have been working the COTR/10th Nazgul Progression Series. Currently playing through Heirs of Numenor. Still lots of replayability to come with the Ringmaker Cycle and the LOTR saga expansions. Stays at 10.

200 plays: This is the first game on BGG that I've played 200 times. Stays at 10.

Pretty solid game. Plays pretty well single player. Also pretty solid for coop.

RATING: 3
I can see the appeal for some, but not for me. For starters the very notion of questing was not fun or interesting for me. Seems like having to take a bet on how you could defeat monsters by tying one hand behind your back. I want to play cool characters to battle enemies or explore, not to tap them to randomly draw a card and see if I advance. That was the big downer for me. I also didn't really like the combat and engagement rules. The way that it played seemed like most of the challenge was early on in a play, as if you got past the early setup and got your engine working you could clear it easily.

I got this to get my deck construction fix while having a solid solo experience. And boy does it deliver. Very solid deck building possible and the adventures are really hard and fun. The only thing that nags me a bit is the fact that the base box doesn't provide 3-of of all starter cards. Components are top notch, configurability is perfect, play time is in the sweet spot of 30-60 minutes and there is tons of fun to be had. Replayability is great, even if you want to tackle the same adventure repated times to beat it.

Lots of fun.  I've been lost in Middle Earth since I was a lad, and this one makes me feel like I get to be part of it.  I enjoy putting decks together, and I enjoy getting to go on adventures.  And I absolutely love every time I get to put a Gondorian spearman between me and a killer spider.

GRADE: B+ 

Ratings feel tentative, but there's a lot to admire here.

The core system is an exciting start to what looks to be an expansive system.  The co-operative LCG is almost immodestly clever, and uniting it with the LotR theme is brilliant marketing AND evocative of theme.  Board games and C/LCGs have been maturing alongside one another for two decades now, exchanging ideas but largely functioning in separate worlds; this game feels like the true weaving-together of the two.  

As an LCG, the systems feel similar to the other FFG offerings.  It's logical despite being rather rules-heavy.  Artwork is great.  While CFarrel is right that the game clearly shares the DNA and bone structure of the ccg patriarch, LotR:TCG actually does feel like its own game rather than a half-cocked version of something like M:TG or L5R.  Old-time ccg players might find it irksome that defending characters do no damage in combat, but the combat system is otherwise cool.  When you have a bunch of allies and heroes with great attachments it does feel like you are fielding a potent fighting force.  

I like it as a co-op game.  In my experience cooperative games feel either thematic or puzzle-like (and sometimes both).  This game feels evocative of theme to me because time pressure is constant and character abilities feel right.  In a two-player game with single-sphere preconstructed decks, each player balances his particular role against the needs of the group.  One turn the fighters in the tactics deck might need to lend their modest contribution to questing; the next turn they may engage and destroy the heavies on the battlefield that would crush any other sphere's heroes.  The possibilities encourage much table-talk.

The scenarios are clever and somehow evocative despite being so tiny (just a couple phases, really).  There's plenty of game here, but this is where the episodic nature of the LCG could provide the most interesting flexibility in the system.  Here's to hoping FFG don't neuter this by deciding to only trickle quests out one card at a time.  

Deckbuilding has always been a solitary meta-game activity for me: you analyze your choices, put together a deck, run it through its paces with some dry runs.  It doesn't really make its debut until it gets some play time with another player.  The genius of Dominion, of course, is that it centralizes this meta-game aspect; it folds deck-building into the game play.  

In its solo mode, the LotR card game is unique in deck-building games in uniting the deck-building and gameplay halves, because once you're done building a deck you can play it immediately against the system.  Furthermore, because it can be hard to win with a single-sphere preconstructed deck, the system nudges you toward deck construction for solo play.  

Do the preconstructed single-sphere decks hum with Blue Moon-style mathematically perfect balance?  Does the game scale so as to provide an equivalent experience between solo single-deck play and 2-deck (2-player) play?  No.  But that's almost beside the point: with the core set you don't buy a single preconstructed deck.  You buy four, which means the game puts all the tools in your hand for you to construct and tune the gameplay experience to get out of it what you want.  

There's also always a vocal number of people who whinge about the need for multiple core sets of these games, but most gamers will find plenty to love in a single core set.  Yet the episodic story-style of the scenarios also makes the possibility of expansions exciting.  

If FFG can fashion nuance and distill strengths in future expansions, they'll have a legend on their hands.

Very entertaining even when playing solitaire. The game gets better with every Adventure Pack and the flavor is spot on. The only trouble is that due to it being a cooperative card game, none of my usual CCG friends want to get into it. This game will be most attractive to people who like board games and RPG's and want to get into a new CCG.

Bought after loving the Game of Thrones 2nd Ed LCG, but not getting to play it enough. It has great art, and a familiar, older, mechanic set.
The Core Set isn't remotely balanced for 1P. Coupled with the fact that to really enjoy LCGs, they require a lot more money AND dedication, it wasn't a keeper for me. Really needs 'Plots' equivalent from AGoT LCG, which gives shape and strategy to card draws and swing. Not to mention thematic flavour. Would jump on a 2nd edition.

RATING: 8
A highly immersive thematic co-op.

The combination of excellent art, a well implemented theme and excellent flow of play creates a very fun game. In addition the game is difficult, as a good co-op should be, but not to the point of frustration. A typical session will keep you constantly involved and a mission won't play the same twice.

I really liked this game, to the point that I'm reversing my opinion on LCGs.. If every LCG base game is as good, complete and replayable as this, then I don't mind the million expansions but on the contrary I'm happy with them!

After 500 plays: The game still amazes me with its replayability. Some minor issues have started to annoy me, but not to the point of ruining the experience:
a)Thematic inconsistencies like a single goblin/spider/orc enemy with inprobable stats causing great havoc to a whole band of heroes could have easily been solved by making said goblin/spider/orc appear as a band/group in the card text/art without changing a single thing in gameplay.
b)As the game develops, the cards developed seem to drift even more slighly from the original lotr design to standard fantasy design - especially with the nightmare packs that on occasion are an absolute thematic nightmare. 
c)The card balance is gradually failing as more and more tough scenarios require better deckbuilding - and this has created pools of great, great on occassion, decent and poor cards detracting from the replayability and hurting variety.

Nearing 750 plays:
Finally this game begins to drop in my preferences. It takes an amazing game to reach 750 plays really, and Lotr has my respect totally. The rating reflects my feelings for it now, at the start it was a pure 10 of course.

RATING: 9
This is my first CCG or LCG and I was a bit reluctant to get into this type of game. I'm also not a huge fan of other cooperative games, finding them lacking in variability and/or feeling more like one player puzzles with a few other players sitting in. I ultimately chose this as my entry into the genre because my younger daughter is a huge fan of all things LOTR and I wanted a regular game to share with her. 

Now, after 40+ plays working our way through the core set scenarios and the entire Mirkwood cycle, I can say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the gameplay experience, and above all the variety of experiences this game has offered. Some scenarios are great (Journey down the Anduin, Conflict at the Carrock) and others are weaker (Hills of Emyn Muil, Dead Marshes) but the game itself has easily stood the test of all those plays and has us ready to revisit some favorite scenarios with newer cards and then dive into Khazad Dum and the Dwarrowdelf cycle. 

Update -- about 8 months and another 40+ plays later and still going strong with this game. Now halfway through Dwarrowdelf cycle and deciding whether to go to Hobbit saga or Heirs of Numenor next, but will inevitably get both. Considering making this my fifth 10 rating.

RATING: 6
A living card game that is a coop.  This combination is such an obvious combination.  Obvious after someone else comes up with the idea.  My biggest problem with a living card game is the lack of dedicated opponent and the fear if I skipped an expansion pack I would be behind the curve if I did have a regular opponent.  Coop games have a finite number of plays until the random elements determine the outcome, and it becomes stale.  New excitement released on a regular basis.  A game design which addresses my biggest hurdles in two types of games.  Wow, such a great idea.

I'm not a Fantasy Flight Games guy.  I'm not a LOTR fan.  I also don't plan to play this solo, except for possible "new deck testing". Out of sheer curiousity and cautious optimism I preordered my copy.  Two plays in, I'm glad I did.  The different factions play differently. The different decks are far more unique in scope than say the Scientist and the Researcher (Pandemic).  

The deck building is underdeveloped at this point in time. Especially with two players, but the core set has me excited for when the system is fully fleshed out, and it has enough variety to keep things interesting without the expansion packs.

This may be a delicate system going forward, and FFG has their hands full keeping the difficulty in the right balance.  Other coops now have a new bar to clear as far as I'm concerned.  Your move coop designers.  

Its a nice depth.  By no means a brainburner, but enough meat for a gamer to chew on.

It may be thematic, but I'm not the person whose comments you should be reading if that is important to you.  I didn't want to finish the book and liked about 1.5 of the movies.  I still dig the game based on mechanisms and the fun factor.

6 plays in now.  Its very enjoyable.  There are quite a bit of bells and whistles to explore.  This is not going to be stale any time soon.

I have no desire to join a tournament, for me this system will be a gigantic sandbox for me to try things out and a nice social game for me and another player.  The core set leads me to believe this is exactly what I had hoped.

This game is okay. I really did love the game at first. But after a couple plays, me and my friend really decided that while the deck-building was unique, the game really lacked in design. The core set is a very good example here. We have tried and tried to beat the last quest in the cores set, with just the core set cards, to no avail. One would have to buy the whole Mirkwood cycle to even beat the last quest! That is outrageous if you ask me. Another good example is the fact that you can lose on turn one to the encounter deck. This is a very bad game design aspect. Apart from that, the theme is AMAZING and the art is superb. This would really be a legendary game if it was better designed and re-playable.

RATING: 6
Beautiful card art, layout/card chrome, and several cool mechanics and synergies make persisting with it worthwhile. Just know: this game is hard. Really hard. That said I love nearly everything about it: the flavor is firing on all cylinders, theme comes through in mechanics big time. Each quest is very unique, and deck construction is quite important if you intend to overcome even the "easy" quests. I'm not going to claim I'm a brilliant strategist, but I am a consummate gamer of many stripes, and I can comfortably say this game is NOT for casual gamers in any way. If it wasn't so dammed cool I'd probably toss it, because I don't normally have the patience/attention span or the time required to succeed at something like this. Mostly the deck construction is what I'm too lazy for, but even playing it over and over to learn what NOT to do before that first successful run through a level, which is of course insanely rewarding given the time you've spent on it. If you like a challenge, enjoy extremely thematic games with a good bit of [painful!] crunch to them, or if you simply must have every LotR or FFG product in your collection - buy now. Even if you don't, though, it seems like this one will be around a long time. It sells well, and FFG have what I assume is their most successful tournament product in this line. So unless they lose the Tolkien license (like they did with the Game's Workshop one... Sigh) I expect they'll wring another 3-5 years out of it, easily.

My first 3 plays:

1 - Didn't know what to do and the cards came, oh, so slowly. And ok, game, rate: 6 - mainly because of the awesome art;

2 - Time passed, so the little that I learned was gone, so again I didn't really now what to do and we lose badly to the scenario. Rate: 5;

3 - Now I finally pick up the rules and with pre-made decks I was able to, finally, play the game properly. A good deal of fun! Enjoyed quite a bit. Now I want to play more.

Love this game.  On the heavy/complex side, and If you are going to play 2 player, you need to find someone you know is into the source material :)  If you are finding it hard to get a LOTR fan friend as huge as yourself, it is a SOLO game too!!!

Quite difficult early on. Lots of replay, and it is an LCG so I guess you can also buy more replay value.

My favourite thing is that the game is based on the original material (with some small liberties and emeblishments :) without pandering to the films.  This is NOT a film cash in game.  The artwork and lore is detailed and they dont use any photo stills from the movie or feel the need to make artwork look like actors etc.

Artwork is great.

Manual is like a small novella - but once you get into it they are some of the most clear rules ive read with loads of example pictures and walkthroughs of phases.

I'm really enjoying LOTR. Accordingly, it gets a high rating from me. However, I would caution that the experience straight out of the box is just good. The core set badly needs support from several expansion before it really starts to make good on it's potential. This means that the high rating is really for a much more expensive game. This game also has the only solo experience that is as good or better than playing video games.

One player game with the first recommended scenario didn't seem to work too well, need some rules clarification. Does using your guys to accomplish the goal cards prevent them from engaging in the fight, and if so then how can you ever win? Plus, the first scenario seems to be missing card #4 with 2 different cards #3? That should never have happened, or at least should have been explained in the rules. I'm dissapointed with this game until I get some further clarification.

Even though the game offers some opportunities for players to support each other with events and attachments, Lord Of The Rings is mostly a solitaire experience in which heroes are pitted against a deck of monsters and random event cards. Especially in the Quest Phase, it feels like the outcome of a "battle" is at the mercy of the staging cards drawn that round and can therefore feel pretty unfair. I love the artwork of the game and the atmosphere that both drawings and flavour text convey, but the game can easily drag and the learning curve is far too steep for casual gamers. Hard to wholheartedly recommend, even though I would not mind playing it again. Your mileage may vary, especially if you enjoy deckbuilding (unlike me).

Ugh, this game is just too hard for mere mortals. Unless you love building and tweaking decks (who on earth has time for that and how bloody dull!) then stay away. It was the hobbit saga that pushed me over the edge....bloody impossible!

OK, I saw Ava Jarvis's blog about using the easy rules to make it playable and to enjoy the narrative. I will try it again...

... I did and the Hobbit saga is STILL unplayable! 

Another update!
I have taken deck lists from the Hall of Beorn website and and am working through the core set with them; I'm hoping I learn enough to be able to play the Saga expansions. This is far too much trouble to go to for a card game - why oh why did FFG make this series unplayable by anyone except super serious gamers with unlimited free time to spend on deck building, a tiny minority surely? I'm only hanging in to recoup the money I stupidly spent on expansions! It's a crying shame, actual playtime is dwarfed by deck preparation and continual tweaking.

Enjoy the game, but got a little burned out after some of the difficult adventures that require specific deck building instead of thematic deck building. I may get back into it eventually.

This is a great game.  It is really hard but you are also supplied with the tools necessary to beat the challenges included.  That being said, if you don't enjoy deck building (or looking up deck builds uploaded by other players) then don't bother (although if you ONLY buy the core set then deck building can be mostly avoided).  If you do enjoy deck building then you will be presented with an endless number of fascinating combinations.

The LotR LCG is a game I loved when I first got it. The gameplay is interesting, the art is gorgeous, the components are very high quality, and it can be played solo or multiplayer.

The co-op nature actually works really well with 3+ people, something that surprises me (I usually hate 3+ LCG games). It also captures the LOTR feel of running through enemy land really well-- you feel suitably epic, often escaping fights by the skin of your nose, slaying lots of evil creatures.

I like the production values.  Nice cards neat threat counter.  Great art.  The rule book is daunting, but clearly written.

Once you get the hang of it gameplay is fairly straight  forward.  The theme was prevalent throughout the scenario.  I like the way the enemies are tailored to your location.

All in all a fun system.  My only complaint would be replayability out of the box.  The quest packs are going to be essential to keep this game alive.

Edit: Traded.  Though the game is excellent.  Deck building is not my thing.

This game has all the ingredients to make a great game: nice cards with nice illustrations, an impending sense of destruction knocking on your door, terrible enemies opposed to some of the best heroes, lots of blood flowing and lots of possibilities (that normally don't lead to AP). Just don't play it alone, at least not following the standard rules, there are some things in them that just doesn't seem right. Play it with two players, though, and you have a great game with lots of fun (and monsters) coming your way! :)

Thematically, this game is an utter failure, especially compared with the brilliant job that the old MECCG did in evoking Tolkien's world through both mechanics and theme.

Gameplaywise, it's moderately interesting though, especially in being unique as a co-op ccg, where the deck-building adds a large extra dimension making it much more enjoyable for me than traditional co-op games.

Not the greatest thing since sliced bread, but definitely a solid entry.  The idea of combining cooperative games with a CCG is a novel one.  I see strong echoes of [gameid=4286].  I enjoy it when it gets pulled out.  I'm not sure that the scenarios in the base game are variable enough to really let the CCG nature of the game shine.  It's going to take some really tough adventures to make that work.

Liked the rules but never tried. Trading away to escape the collecting trap; would even keep it and collect it, but its not enought to buy one of each box to have 3 cards of each type to put in a deck (max allowed), and buying more would leave me with a lot of useless cards.
Gave it a go using a friends set in a desperate try to keep the game because I enjoy the theme and the art, but I dont think it was good enought to keep on collecting it, and I dont see a point in just keeping the core set. Sold.

Played enough to know this is way harder than it should be out of the box (balance issues). I don't get why enemy gets to attack and defend each turn (and always has initiative) and my heroes only get one or the other. Still despite the flaws, something makes me want to keep playing.

RATING: 7
One of the most truly cooperative co-ops I own. If you aren't intimidated by the card game nuanced rules or put off by the theme this can be a rewarding (but often brutal) gaming experience. One of the best solo games I have played (rate it an 8). Lots of choices, lots of fun.
------------------------------------------

After many games and hours of enjoyment I am finding that the LCG format may not be for me. I like the idea of picking more adventures that look fun and purchasing them, however, the new player cards in each set seem to build on each other encouraging the completionists. There could still be more mileage in this one for me if I can find some one else as interested in the deck building aspect of the game. As it stands I feel like I've played out the scenarios that I have and none of the new ones really grab me.

Absolutely brilliant. The deck-building and tactical depth of Magic the Gathering and the thematic feel of Arkham Horror. The monthly quest packs mean there's always a new challenge, but the different colours/deck styles/varied encounter deck means each quest has lots of replay ability. 

Don't be put off by the Lord of the Rings theme, if you're not into that sort of thing. The thematic feel is immersive hunt or battle, etc.

RATING: 5
This is a mighty fiddly game, and I'm very glad that I had someone to teach it to me, since I had such a hard time getting the basic order of the turn down.  It has some neat mechanisms that keep the game going (I especially like the balances among the quest, the strength, and the action on the cards), but ultimately it's a cooperative game, and they still more or less elude me.  It's a fine enough design, but I would much rather play a game where I'm going up against someone else instead of us all working together.  That being said, kudos to the designer for having all players keep their cards hidden instead of sharing them (though, of course, I was asking advice from my more-experienced cohort).

This is probably a game that I admire more than I like.  Nothing wrong with that, but it's clearly not the game for me.

A bit disappointed with this game. It comes across as a clever card game with the LOTR theme tacked on. Though advertised as a solo game, it tries to do too much, catering for everyone, being two player aswell, and even more players can be added on. So much so, that only a few games can be played solo, some are so hard that you need more than one player.

I can't really get into the theme. For instance, in the Passage through Mirkwood scenario, why are major and critical personages (eg Aragorn, Glorfindel) risking life and limb merely to deliver an obvious message to Galadriel that things are getting worse? Why can dwarves have multiple axes with cumulative bonuses? Why do some characters quest and others fight, are they a party sticking together or are they all doing their own thing? BUT those that are away questing and cannot fight can still get injured during a fight, so not sure what the logic is here.

As a positive, Gandalf is nicely represented, he acts as he does in the books, comes when there is trouble, then goes away. And the game can be fun to play.

I do find it hard to rationalize what is happening in the game, and many of the cards introduce new rules that can be difficult to figure out.

After so many plays...I should probably rate this game. This rating is mid-Darrowdelf cycle. I love this cooperative game. Difficult and forces you to rebuild your deck, probably my favorite of the LCG format, as it really requires you to be able to adapt to the quest. 

It could become burdensome as we have to remember all the cards (we are starting from the beginning, which helps us know the card pool), and sometimes you just get a bad set of cards to come out either from your hand or the encounter deck...but we just reset and go again.

I played this as a two-player game and enjoyed it a lot!  I liked being able to choose from the four character areas (leadership, lore, spirit, tactics) and the way the scenarios gave a thematic feel to the game.  I'm excited to try out something harder than a LV 1 difficulty scenario, but I'm worried that some of the harder ones will require building a specialized deck.

Interesting system of cooperative/solo cardplay. Sadly it feels very luck dependant. Draw a few bad cards in a row, and the game will be over in no time, making it feel extremely unfair at times. Other times in can be a total cakewalk. Expansions are said to make it more manageable and comprehensive, but the core system doesn't really warrant any big investments for me.
The game does have beautifully painted artwork.

A great game for 2 players. You can build decks and try them on the three different quests. The rules are not very difficult, but there are some card interactions where you need the rules or the FAQ.
Passage through Mirkwood is developed to learn the game and is very easy.
In Journey down the Anduin there are two difficult moment: beating the Hill Troll in the beginning and the beginning of stage 3 where all the enemies can engage you.
Escape from Dul Guldur is difficult to win. One of your hero's is captured at the start and when he's rescued a Nazgul comes into play. The fact that players can only play one ally makes it hard.

I'm struggling with my opinion on this one. On one hand, it's certainly a well designed game that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, namely providing a challenging co-op experience for players to work through together. On the other hand, I'm just not feeling great about constantly re-building decks to take on the new adventure packs, especially when it's possible (and advisable) to look through the shadow deck and put in counters to everything it can throw at you. It just feels like a waste of time.

I've played it a ton, so it is a good game. It feels like a souped-up version of Space Hulk: Death Angel, which is pretty high praise. I just think my desire to spend time building decks for what is essentially a solitaire game is running a little thin. I might trade it or I might buy more expansions. I just can't figure out where I'm going with this one...

This game, though, was pretty much a snoozer for me.  I love the artwork, and my wife even played it with me... but I was really underwhelmed.  Too many rules; and too marginalized thematically for it to ever see my table.  

Recently sold it on Amazon, with my blessings to the new owner.

It's a fun cooperative card game. The mechanics work nicely, and the game is fun to play solo and with a partner. The narrative even manages to work out of the time, despite the silliness of some of the situations. Unfortunately, the only impetus to "deck build" is to beat the harder campaigns, which will require more investment than a game I would view as merely "nice" would usually deserve. So this doesn't really leave you with a lot of incentive to keep playing. Which is too bad.

RATING: 7
The game is VERY difficult to play solitaire. The main problem is the lack of ressources and "cheap cost" cards in the Core Set. Being beaten 3 of 4 times by the first scenario after (re)building a deck is very unfair. There are many really nasty "when revealed" and "shadow" effects. This leads to the problem, that although the game is pretty exciting, it is very demotivating to lose twice in 3 hours, damn! Perhaps I should stick to playing solo without dealing Shadow cards...

Thus, the mechanics create a very gloomy game, but you still have a little control (not as random as Arkham Horror). Sometimes, I forget the thematic flaws and enjoy... 
But now my rant:

1. Already 4 Card Errata in the Core Set. 3 of them captured in the FAQ v1.1, 1 captured here:
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/678604/wandering-took-question

So, I wonder, how many more card mistakes and misprints are still to come with the expansions. Someday one will need a sheet with only card errata printed, to play the game and to have fun, which is absurd! Please FFG, reprint the incorrect cards and put them in the Core Set and/or expansions. Like Plaid Hat Games did it with Thorkur from Summoner Wars.

2. Mediocre/bad theme implementation.
a) So playing "Steward of Gondor" on Aragorn would mean a messenger reaches the heroes and informs Aragorn about becoming a Steward of Gondor?!?! WTF? Why now, on the way through Mirkwood? How can 3 Heroes all be Stewards of Gondor? And what about Denethor? Completely unthematic, it's a pity.

b) Also, why can't your character attack the enemy after he defended? Oh, he is so exhausted! Damn it!

c) Also, why can't your characters attack enemies in the staging area when they are questing? What the hell are they doing there???

d) Also, you can lose a scenario, because some DARN BATS chased your hero away from questing thus you lose because of the Threat coming from distant locations like the Old Forest Road or the Forest Mountains! Oh, come on, BATS chased Aragorn away because he was the only one questing. That's ridiculous!

e) Also, in the scenario Journey down the Anduin, your heroes, already travelled through Mirkwood towards Lorien, arrive in the Brown Lands!!! Oh, come on!

EDIT: Won the first time, still playing the 1. Scenario without dealing Shadow cards. This way, it is still very random, but not so random as Arkham Horror.

[b]Pro[/b]:
- the enemy AI and the card abilties + effects function well, sometimes too well :\
- you can build a deck and try it out solo... and rebuild it...
- 2-3 hours play time
- suspenseful game
- rules: good turn summary including the timing when you may play actions

[b]Contra[/b]:
- card errata
- bad theme implementation
- very difficult game, especially for the beginners, no rules included to [b]really[/b] scale the difficulty (so play at least without dealing Shadow cards the first couple of games)

My initial reaction to playing this game was that it seemed kind of interesting and sure had cool artwork on the cards. After getting it in a trade and playing it solo a bunch of times I was ready to give up on it as it seemed impossible to win at. After realizing that this game really needs to be played with two or more players, I fell in love with it and have now acquired quite a few expansions.

Great game, had a lot of fun and gameplay time with just the Core Set. Expansions and adventure packs only enhance this. Only issue I have with the Core Set is that some of the best cards only come with 1 or 2 copies. If every player card had 3 copies I might have rated it 10/10. With just the card pool of a single Core Set the quests become more frustratingly difficult. Still highly recommended though! :)

Well I said I'd never get into LCG's which I see as the new CCG format.  So I've broken that parameter with this game which meets two of my requirements for getting an LCG game.  It's Tolkien based, of which I'm a fan, and it's coop.  Out of the box, it has good game play and thematically there's room for the game to grow.  Sure you'll be buying more decks and adventures (as will I), but you don't have to compete to get that ultra rare set of cards to make your decks.  Also, it plays fairly simple with a good rules set and again, plenty of theme.

This is a tremendous game. It is full of theme, offers great deck building options, is challenging and plays solo. Oh, and the artwork is stunningly beautiful.
I got a custom made insert and several expansions and this makes the game truly shine. Can't wait to play it more.

I was very optimistic about this game but it let me down seriously. Main is the difficulty curve when enemies/locations are coming into game. Every turn the same amount of monsters/locations arrives, and difficulty is increasing in flat growing line. At the same time player can expand his power exponentially for some time (with cards like Steward of Gondor if I remember that name correctly). Problem is, if you don't handle monsters/locations from the first turn, that exponential growth will come too late. And if you're able to handle, then it's not a big issue to push a bit forward and start growing power. All it boils down whether you can match game difficulty curve (=line) with your power curve. Once you match, you won. So you lose very fast and know you'll win very fast (except that actual winning drags a lot). That's a lot different from MTG (well MTG is not solitaire, but I think it can be compared), where you aren't so forced to keep tempo and can have some slower or faster strategies. in LOTR LCG, game forces it's tempo thus reducing available strategies.
Plus, it's disappointing money-wise that there's only single copy of some key cards like Unexpected Courage so you need 3 base boxes. I have Android Netrunner which has similar problem with singles for some cards, but at least in Netrunner the singles aren't so critical (except for some very specific decks) so Netrunner is fine with 2 base boxes in almost all cases.

8/9/12: I'm very happy I bought this game again. Solo play is difficult and it's a lot of numbers going on, but it feels much more thematic for some reason. Also, watching Rodney Smith's [url=http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7691E24FD7613341&feature=plcp]Watch it Played[/url] helped immensely.

November 29, 2014: I used to love this game, but I just don't play it nearly as much as I once did. I think this is mostly due to deckbuilding. I'd rather put more time into Netrunner which gets played versus this. Still, if you're willing to put the time into it, it's a wonderful game.

March 31, 2015: This game has turned into a 6 for me and is being sold.

It's still a wonderful game, but I'm no longer interested in playing.

Tolkien, so even if I didn't even like the game, I'd probably still collect the cards. But the game is solid, and pretty hard as well! I almost exclusively play this solo, as none of my friends enjoy the brain burn this game can give you when you first start learning it. I prefer MECCG for a Tolkien ccg, as that game is much more thematic, but this game is alive and kicking, and I enjoy following where it goes. I sometimes have trouble holding on to the theme during all the number crunching, though...

This is currently my favorite card game. I really wish I kept track of all my plays because the number would probably be staggering.

There is a surprising amount of playability out of just a core set here, for solitaire or co-op play. The artwork is beautiful - so far my favorite presentation of any of the LCGs.

If you intend to play solitaire, consider tracking down some of the home-brewed scenarios found online. The third scenario from the core-set is basically unplayable on your own.

We currently own all of the expansions for this game.

Beautiful cards and the theme comes through well in gameplay and the quests. I was taken with the ability of this game to immerse the player into the fantasy of Lord of the Rings. The wins, and losses, all felt like a true result of the players decisions, be they mine in solo play, or the table as a group.  Encounters were the only luck factor, so chance was not rampant, but natural. One is wisked away for the duration of the game into danger, suspense, victories, sacrifices and adventure...all with a deck of cards. Good solo play as well.

Lays Potato Chips.  A game that I can't stop at just one.  

This game is a masterful design.  It amazes me at how easily it flows.  A twenty-five page rulebook which explains seven phases of every turn shouldn't play so smoothly!  Or create such an immersive experience.

But even as I'm playing, my mind is bubbling with imaginative pictures of spiders attacking me as I walk a narrow pathway through forests.

It can be frustrating, no doubt.  But even as I am logging my latest loss, I'm contemplating my next scenario.  Good stuff.

Beautiful artwork, quick play, endless re-playability.  A  wonderful game.  :) 

Edited 2-19-13--------

I left the game for about a year.  I wasn't able to defeat the second scenario and became a bit frustrated.  I wasn't angry with the game, I just realized that I would have to start deck-building to progress and I didn't want to do that at the time.  

I never did a deck-build in my gaming life and it intimidated me.  A month and a half ago, I went back to it after delving into the LotR:LCG forums in addition to watching videos.

I began to deck-build then fell in love.  This is the finest game I've ever played by a wide margin.  It's amazing how much this game consumes my thoughts.  I love the theme, the quick set-up, the game mechanics, the brain-burn, the sense of accomplishment I feel when I beat a scenario, the knowledge that new adventures will continue to come out, adding to my pleasure.

I have recently bought every expansion to date.  It wasn't cheap, but I know this will engage me for years.

Solo play or with others, it delivers an extremely immersive experience.  Negatives for the game are mere quibbles.  I will warn you that this game isn't easy, but it is beatable.  Don't expect to pick it up and have a chance if you aren't willing to put some thought into it and take your lumps along the way.

RATING: 9
Sept 2011: Our initial plays were engrossing hikes through Tolkien-land that have us looking forward to additional sessions.

Nov 2012: With two base sets, a few expansion packs, and 3-4 players, LOTR is great fun.  Just a fantastic design.

June 2017:  The game is as mathy as it's always been, but LoTR but is now a mainstay as a 3-player family gaming experience (adults + older teens).  After an extended break from LoTR - devoted almost exclusively to consecutive [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/23234/pathfinder-adventure-card-game]Pathfinder ACG[/url] campaigns - we're back in the Middle Earth saddle. My dusty expansions have finally been opened and enjoyed.

Jan 2018: We've completed everything up to and including The Lost Realms block, with a focus on constructing interesting but effective generalist decks.  We don't have the time or motivation to fine-tune our homebrew builds over 5-10 plays to beat each scenario, so in some cases we play on easy or semi-easy mode (see below) to keep things moving. Our next goal is to complete the Saga expansions in campaign mode; at the moment, we're halfway through.

[i]Note[/i]: The 9 rating is for the LoTR LCG as an extended experience that includes all releases - not just for the core set.

And even though the LoTR LCG is a top 10 game for me, it isn't without its flaws:

- The game can be sensitive to the exact cards that come out on set-up. It can crash and burn almost immediately, causing you to lose in just a few turns.
- Certain scenarios aren't balanced for certain player counts.  Some are much easier with 3-4 players, while others become impossible.  The reverse is also true: Some are a cakewalk with 1-2 players, while others are blatantly unfair with low player counts.
- In some cases stated difficulty levels simply aren't accurate.  Usually in the direction of "more difficult" - but not always.

Glossary:

Official FFG easy mode: Double starting resources, gold-bordered ("difficult") encounter cards removed.

Semi-easy mode #1: Standard resources, difficult cards removed.

Semi-easy mode #2: Double starting resources, no cards removed.

Before Heirs of Numenor, we pretty much only played in standard mode. Starting with HoN, we took the following approach: standard mode for scenarios ranked 5 or lower (with key exceptions in each block), and for 6+ difficulty we use semi-easy mode #1 or #2 as the scenario requires or the mood strikes us.  In extreme cases (i.e., stupidly impossible or just annoying) we revert to true easy mode. And sometimes even that doesn't help.

Final Thoughts: From a money perspective, LoTR hasn't been a great buy. Spending $13 for a few player cards and a single scenario (played twice at most) doesn't seem like the wisest financial decision.  But from a leisure and long-term campaign perspective, it's been awesome.  And someday the kids will enjoy replaying the entire series with their own kids and adult friends, or maybe they'll go the solo route.  So they'll get eventually get my money's worth even if I don't. Or at least that's what I keep telling myself.

I was sure that I will never get into any CCG/LCG type card games. This one convinced me though using its solo mode. Now I do not need a gaming partner that is keeping up with all the nre cards. I can buy expansions as fast or as slow as I feel like ... GREAT

As for the game - it is so thematic and so hard that it just keeps coming to the table. I love the strategy part (deck building) and mostly tactic part (playing the scenario with a constructed deck) - amazing. 

Victory in LOTR:LCG tastes great!

Drawbacks :
- Sometimes bad luck will spoil your plans and in some scenarios you need ton of luck (at least with basic cards) to have a shot at winning at all.
- If you get into it (which means that you love it) it might be hard on your wallet.

It is an interesting game but it seems a bit limited by and to its quest mechanism. When a quest becomes challenging, it is usually time to customise and optimise decks in order to make life easier and more fun (for those who like to win at least). However, that deck only serves to defeat a particular quest, contrary to CCG decks which are always challenged by new opponents/tactics. With CCG, one can aim for the absolute winning machine. Here it is merely a case of arranging cards together to beat the odds more often.
However, I tend to like it a lot. Its difficulty is often reinforced by the randomness of the hand and of the drawing of cards. Sometimes even fate cannot be overcome... That means that one should be prepared to lose a lot. Then if one gets discouraged, his impression will be one of repeated failure and utterly displeasing gaming experience. If one takes the challenge and tries to beat the quests, he may well spend days and days between metagaming and actual gaming. In the end, if one can win more than lose, he had a satisfying solution to the problem. Replayability is quite high with that in mind.
Solo game is enjoyable and probably a better source of metagaming. Two players games are probably a good way to work ahead of optimising a solo deck. They generate more ennemies per turn, but the players can tackle the main hurdles with much more possibilities.

At the price of one movie ticket, an expansions will provide hours of enjoyment.

Really happy with this game. It has lots of positive things going for it: great art, easy to follow rules in a good rule book, interesting co-op element, a stiff challenge and above all it's just a lot of fun to play -  win or lose. One of my favourite games in recent years. 

One of the set backs of the game is the time-consuming deck building and tweaking process. With every new deluxe box and adventure pack cycle the encounter deck throws new challenges at the players. This is a good thing since it keeps the game fresh but as the card-pool increases it takes longer and longer to prepare decks for the specific challenge posed by each quest. The game demands a lot of your time outside of the actual playing experience and this can create a bit of a barrier to wanting to pull this game out and play it.

Approaching a year since we last played, game currently sits in a plastic bin in the garage.

We pulled it out again and have started working through the adventures from the beginning. It brings back a lot of fond memories, we're having a great time playing this again.

The journey through the deluxe expansions is going strong, we are into the last quest of the Lost Realms  box after 87 games in this run I'm feeling more into the game than ever. I recently bought more saga expansions and the Dreamchaser cycle. Once we reach the end of the Harad cycle I think we'll start on the Sagas.

+ Mirkwood cycle, Kazad Dum cycle, Numenor Cycle, Isengard cycle, Lost Realms, Hobbit Saga, Lord of the Rings saga pt 1.

VersiÃ³n propia, impresas en printerstudio con un pequeÃ±o error de imprenta(una pequeÃ±o borde blanco sÃ³lo en el anverso, pero no afecta a la jugabilidad ni a la legibilidad de las cartas. Reversos perfectos).
Se entregarÃ­a enfundado, en una caja de almacenaje y con separadores, asÃ­ como las fichas necesarias. 
El juego no ha tenido muchas partidas, los cooperativos no han cuajado en mi grupo de juego.
No dudÃ©is en pedir fotos, el resultado es espectacular.

Not bad. Somewhat thematic, but can become a bit "gamey". Suffers from a bit of a runaway leader problem (unusual for a cooperative game, I think)- once you start to falter a bit you usually lose quickly, and if you get off to a good start you generally win.

1. World-class art on EVERY card.
2. It's Lord of the Rings.
3. It is festooned with giant spiders.

You now know all that you need.

Plus, it's rock-hard solo!

Very good. Quite clever.
Extremely enjoyable solo, and this game can (and will) increase in enjoyment with every new card released.
I won't buy more than one pack of anything - no need. BUT I will be adding all the new cards as they appear. I will very much enjoy making decent hero decks - when there are vast numbers of cards to choose from, and I can limit every card to a maximum of one (Highlander style).

If this gets a mega-adventure pack, with a 6-10 encounter card [i]Mines of Moria[/i] adventure, and/or a decent [i]Cirith Ungol and Shelob's Lair[/i] set, I'll probably rate this game 8+. Maybe.

The short and sweet of what I don't care for, ma'am:

I think I preferred LoTR as a solo game, as opposed to some 2-player games we played later. Then it just appeared a bit too fiddly and overwrought for a 'quick' 2-player card game. Plus you don't really get a full game in the box - you really do need more cards to play it more than a dozen times, I think. I still will only buy one base set, however.

Some things felt lacklustre: lack of epic quest, and could have done with a greater number of quicker adventure stages, we found. I dislike the fact that after a while the locations just keep 'piling' into the staging area. Also (my biggest dislike) why do the main characters have to tap to complete the main quest? They can't then defend against the skittering hordes of spiders, or biting orc blades - what gives with that! Surely it's more heroic to fight the critters, not tap to add [i]determination[/i] or whatever it's called, to overcome the shadow's threat.

So I like it, but it's a little counter-theme in places.

A CCG feel Co-Op with amazing LotR art!? I was hooked by the concept right away! The solo game is quite enjoyable, but the game is more fun with more people... though 4 seems like too many for the quests in the base game to be challenging.  All the same this is a solid, unique experience of a game.

An excellent and challenging card based quest game. I really love this one, but it's come to the point of just having perhaps too many expansions, which makes it difficult to figure out what to buy. Still, a great game, mechanics and theme-wise, and a novel solo experience. Definitely recommended.

I like the theme, and the art work of it. Haven't played as much as I would like to, but it plays pretty good solo and two player. Sold it just because my friend has a copy with all of the expansions.

Another great game by FFG. I especially love this game because it can be played Solo or with up to 3 other friends (with another core set or enough expansions). The pacing can be annoying if you encounter too many monsters or vice verse with too many locations. Then again, that's the lite deck building aspect to the game as well. FFG sets you up with a difficulty number and it's up to you to decide how to handle the deck you're adventuring through with the four different spheres of influence. Not only this but it's a LCG (living card game) so a new pack to the cycle comes out each month to further the story line and new cards to your set.

We had a blast with this in the beginning but now haven't played in in quite some time. Some quests (I'm looking at you, quest where you start with a friggin' troll) are incredibly hit-or-miss. I guess a valid complaint with this game is the fact that you either lose quickly and painfully or you just get stronger and steamroll through everything with very little in-between. Still, it's LOTR (which the mrs. loves) and we've enjoyed it.

I really like the mechanics of this game and the fact that it is co-op. There is a lot of thinking involved, but much like many card games there is luck of the draw as well. Each quest is going to have a different feel every time you play them based on what cards come out. It does add to replay value as well as occasional frustration. The game is balanced enough so that you usually have a fighting chance. (some of the more challenging quests can be a pain.)

The game does have a bit of a learning curve and I suggest watching the tutorial on Fantasy Flights website over reading the rulebook alone.

Very good card game. Plays fast and is (for it's complexity) rather easy to explain. Haven't got into the deck building - have to see how this changes the playing experience). I am a bit turned down by those extra expansions (downloadable content, anyone?).

Another great LCG from Fantasy flight. An easy to learn cardgame that shines in solo play. But is also good with others. The various quests feel different. FFG is getting more and more creative with the quest system. There is a lot of flavour and the game catches the spirit of LOTR universe. 

Some concerns : 
There might be some power creep after a few expansion (though the quests get harder each cycle).  And the difficulty rating of the quests is off track (this is mostly because a box expansion takes all cards of a cycle into account). However the quests are always thematical and thought out well.  

The deckbuilding with this game is awesome, there's a lot of interesting combinations and decks to be explored. There are a lot of submitted decks online but it more rewarding to find your own best deck. 

Thoughts after several expansions:
The game is still as hard as ever. Nightmare packs make the easier scenario's of the base set harder. The cards have remained as thematically as ever. New mechanism have been introduced that capture the spirit of the particular lotr quests. Game is in a very good healthy state. 

This or Arkham lcg ? 
While Arkham does ameliorate the gameplay in certain parts like location exploration, it does add the tokens and tests that make it much more random and annoying. Also lotr has made more cards that make interacting with locations better. 
The decks are very small so fewer deckbuilding if at all. Deckbuilding is just more interesting in lotr.

I enjoy this game so much. Love the diversity, the adventure, the lore. Have nearly all the adventure packs, and I have all the Deluxe Expansion. Wife loves it, I own two copies for 4 player games. Huge hit at the table. Never had so much fun getting the crap kicked out of me.

Finally had to change the rating after more than 300 games with this. If you only have the Core Set, I'd give it an 8, but with some expansions this quickly became the most addictive, fun game I've ever played - and I generally dislike card games.

The artwork is beautiful, and I like the game mechanics and theme, but I found that my enjoyment of the game waned significantly with repeated plays.  I liked the difficulty, but I've found that, without an aggressive and strategic mix of players, not only will you lose frequently (which in and of itself is fine), but you'll begin to feel like you're engaging in an uphill battle by yourself.  This isn't the game's fault, of course, but I think it is illustrative of the key challenge in co-op style games.  Through my first several plays of this game, I really enjoyed it, but, since then, it has begun to ruin my enjoyment for co-operative games, though I haven't quite figured out why this game in particular has done that for me, where games like Arkham Horror, for example, haven't.  Maybe it's because it all boils down to the luck-of-the-draw reality of a card game; maybe I simply prefer a string of bad dice rolls instead of a string of mediocre hands of cards.  On the other hand, I'm a huge fan of Combat Commander, where a "string of bad cards" increases the tension of the game, and there's always the chance that fate will shift back into your favor -- in LotR:TCG, however, it just means the game is all but completely lost once you start to lose your footing.  Yup, I think that's the key reason this game has dipped down a bit for me.

Update:  Gah!  It's back up to a 9 for me, but I've decided to only play it solo.  I really enjoy the challenge of creating a good deck for a given quest, then testing it, tweaking it, and so forth.

3 copies.

I just wish they hadn't made you buy 3 Core Sets to get a complete playset, yet again...

Other than that: fantastic design, clever mechanics, very thematic and challenging.

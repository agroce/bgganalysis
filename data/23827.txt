This is really one outstanding game.  One totally different from any other in my collection and certainly by far the noisiest!

Being an English group it was a question of translating and typing labels for the cards - the text being essential to the game's atmosphere.  At the time I had no idea whether or not we would enjoy it after so many hours of hard work.  But as it turned out it was a winner.  You need the right people, of course.  But with the right players (and total disregard for any disturbance you might cause by the shouts that it generates) you'll have a whale of a time, believe me.

Great game if you want to simulate a football tournament.
The man in black everything you've ever hated and loved in a referee. (He can influence the dice, give penalties out of the blue, decide if the fault was committed inside or outside of the box, etc...)
Very easy mechanism to get into, but once the matches start, every soccer fan will most likely forget the time.
I don't see myself playing the game with 32 teams though.

It is a great design, components are nice and the gameplay was fun. Maybe the time needed to play a whole EM was a little bit long (but I never had a look at my watch!).

The only thing is: I don't like soccer (the theme of the game) very much. Also at the beginning it was hard to get an overview about the chances who is going to play against which team? 

If it would have another theme I would rate it a 9.

The game is great fun - especially when played while a big soccer tournament is running in "real life". But I wouldn't play it more than once or twice a year, as it is quite random and the game mechanics are lacking in some areas.

Nice game but it takes a little bit too long.
Also bad is that the teams are out of date. A football game lives from its actuality.

Not really a game but a lot of fun, think of Kreml with rolling a lot of dice

fun fun fun ... this game is a blast for every soccer fan (if you don´t seek deep strategy). Would be a perfect "10" if there´ll be a chance to get some extra cards in the future to play big tournaments (32 teams) without compromise.

Wenn die Mitspieler auch Fußballfans sind, dann bereitet ein Turnier mit 16 Mannschaften einen riesigen Spaß! Einmal im Jahr kommt es bei uns auf den Tisch und begeistert auch am Fußball interessierte Spielemuffel.

A complex card game with very big chaotic elements. But it gets VERY social and delivers a great gaming atmosphere!

funny, very social game with soccer fans. I especially like the ref taking sides. Quite long (3-4 h)

You have to play it with a fun-loving group, who isn't always serious. You also have to understand that the world is not always fair (role of the referee) ;)

The whole idea and the card text is a 10, of course. However it lasts a little too long even in the base game with 16 teams. However, it depends on the way players are playing the game (reading the text loud, giving comments, talking to the referee and the like).

Card management is everything, but the referee makes the game. It takes quite long for a full tournament, but we got rewarded with quite some fun. It will help for sure if you like football.

Very funny game, maybe the best (and most realistic?) simulation of a football tournament. If you are a soccer fan you will love this. The only drawback is that it takes a really long time to play.

Rating gone up one point, after many years it is still a blast to play.

Very, very cool game but it really depends on the group too I guess. Simple card playing game with lots of bluffig, negotiating, gambling and backstabbing going on. You can really see the tension rise up until the finale. Oh and btw: the game also manages to produce reasonable outcomes of the world cup - you could almost see it as a simulation of the real game ;)

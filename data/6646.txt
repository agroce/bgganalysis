The main drawback to it is the simultaneous movement via written orders for all units.  This takes time and is really cumbersome. I haven't tried it with the two point impulse movement to get around that but it seems like it wouldn't work very well.

Otherwise a fun game with very nice components.

Had potential ... main problems for me are the length - not that I dislike long games but this one felt too long. There seems only one strategy, get manors and the combat might be 'realistic' but just feels very random.

Doubt it will get played again with my group.

The good news:
I like being a knight: pillage neighbouring villages, inspire my peasants to work harder and rob local monks. This game let's me do it all! The challenging part is balancing economy and military. Shall I send my men-at-arms to conquer new lands or should they squeaze the last pennie out of my lazy peasants? Shall I build more troops or build a watermill?

The bad news:
The combat-system is flawed, order-writing is cumbersome and taxation requires a lot of counting. 
The advanced rules (Arthur's regular visit) are crap.

The verdict:
Forget about what I've written under bad news. It doens't matter. Once you've burned your neighbours crops, you'll understand what I mean. It's simply a great game! Also probably the best game on manorial management in medieval times. The game has very little to do with Arthurian legend (except for the advanced rules), but I think that's a good thing.

An excellent economic/resources sub-system, but the movement rules are unclear. With a bit of tweaking this would be an excellent game, as it is it is a bit unsatisfying.

RATING: 6
Manage and improve your estates, crush your enemies and try to gain favor of King Arthur. Someway feels a bit like Settler's of catan.

Secret order mechanism is nice, but the amount of dice rolling in combats makes the overall experience frustrating.

With a more streamlined combat system my rating would be higher.

I played this game (Excalibur) quite some years ago with my friends. We had a great time although it took some time to play. Now, I bought it second hand, and tried it. It seems it had some rules that needed ironing out. A good game.

Don't get me wrong, i like this game but i always find the rules a bit lacking in something, and the game plays the same way. Maybe this was a game from which parts were taken then refined into the excellent worker placement or (less likely perhaps) empire building games of nowadays?

The Swedish rules seem oddly incomplete. Even with house rules to fill in the gaps it played kind of awkwardly, at least with three players: if two players fight, the third wins; if no one fights, the game is pointless. It's beautiful, though.

This is nearly a "perfect 10."  I love the game, it's a good blend of both tactical and strategic decisions.  Do you spend now to buy lots of troops or do you build a mill in order to invest in your local economy.  If the combat system were a little more detailed, it would be a 10+

Always liked this game, but hard to find people to play it.  It has a beautiful board (although it tends to warp), nicely illustrated cards, and pretty good counters, although the backs of many mysteriously are missing the illustrations.  Gameplay is varied and tense, with written orders making movement tricky.  You have to balance economics, diplomacy and warfare, and money is often very tight.  Julian Musgrave really deserves some notice for his games under the Wotan label, as they are exciting, varied, and fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Under-appreciated.  The Wotan designers were pretty clever.  Beautiful map, great (if simple) counter art, easy hidden movement, and great optional rules that are worth adding in.  This game really has a lot to offer.  My only complaint is that the puzzle board is a little warpy, but nothing some lucite couldn't handle.  Excalibur is ripe for the addition of more stuff (though it doesn't technically need it) I would love to see more units, more buildings, more events etc.

I'm excited to hear that with the rebirth of Wotan, Excalibur will get a second edition.

Move knights and roll combat dice to expand your lands, and build your economy to be able to hire more knights to dominate the board.

Plays: More than a dozen.
Type: Wargame = a game where you move military forces on a map to destroy other military forces and/or conquer territory. Point-to-point movement style. Strategic scale.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: 2-6.
Playing time: Definitely more than the 120 mins BGG is listing. 240 mins?
Player interaction: Conflict and Diplomacy.
Randomness: Medium - dice.

Replayability: Low, it takes too long and gets repetitive.
Fun: I’m a big fan of multi-player wargames in general and of simultaneous order selection in particular, but this one isn’t so fun. There’s too much book-keeping involved and there are runaway leader issues.
Memorability: Decent, but the map and armies are a bit too generic to really inspire stories.

Thematic integration: Decent.
Components: The board is pretty and the counters functional. My boards came warped though. I find any game that requires pen-and-paper record keeping fiddly.

Who will like this: There are better multi-player wargames. Shogun is probably first in line.

Game has dated "mechanics", but a great "independent" effort war games. . beats spending 8 hours playing "twilight imperium". . .some of our most memorable war-gaming moments in college were spent playing this (in 1990-1991). . .the pathetic part of the game is the "puzzle" board - which, once mounted on a board, was promptly left under a bed after graduation. . .

A pretty game where you build your district and equip your squires and soldiers. However, the opportunity cost of going to war is so high (since your army is needed for overseeing the sowing and collecting the taxes) that players tend to do very little else.

Update: Sold because all my games tended to stall once the initial districts have been claimed.

Designer's notes are let down by inaccurate summary of Anglo Saxon England. Both the  Vikings and Danes were beaten by the Saxons. Further, Alfred and his successors notably Athelstan, created the Kingdom of England. England was one of the wealthiest kingdoms in western europe, and had an effective  civil service. As for Greek phalanx seeing off Norman cavalry, absolute tosh. The Normans would have flanked them and ridden them down. The Byzantines with cavalry and infantry were seen off by the Normans.

I think the biggest cons that this game has is: resulting combat. It's very RANDOM. It's just one dice. It's almost like a lottery. Like a simple hazard game in the middle of strategy game. 

If I'd have time, I'd change these things in this game:
- resulting combat, fighting in fight mile-stones;
- economic buildings are upgradeable, means more for the strategy - because now there is only one strategy: grab so many manors as You can!
- I'd set a home base for every player - a one manor for each player that cannot be conquered by anyone, never - now You can elliminate a player!
- more possibilities for a player during a battle - maybe a support possibility by a unit just one mile away from the fight place?
- cards driven move - that would make it faster, much more faster to play! It can also add depth to the game - even more strategies.

We played this allot when it came out.

Combat system is flawed. To much luck. Just get the biggest stack and bully anyone that doesn't do the same. Or if both max out it is just down to luck.

Apart from the troublesome jigsaw board (still pretty, though), the components are very nice. Writing down orders is a drag, and can lead to confusion and heated discussion about timing. Shame, since this game simply oozes theme. I keep hoping someone will upddate this one with decent mechanics.

Tentative rating after playing a couple of years of game time through in a two player game, just to get a feeling for how the game works.

The economy is kind of fascinating, and I'm curious how well it will play with more people.

Childhood times... Hours, days, weeks spent over "Excalibur" board... Killing, plundering, raping... Sweet life of medieval warlord... Maybe without this last activity, but anyway, great game! ;) 15-30 games, maybe more.

I've build with my brother our own expansion set for it: Viking Raids; new, additional map; additional rules about castles, river-boats moving, and cities (in plans only).

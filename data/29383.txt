Decent quality components. I was dissappointed with not being able to implement an expansive tactical plan, terrain and scenario parameters not conducive to much strategy. 

Tried again, nicely polished rules, can see the many years of consim discussion shining through. Struggling a touch with elevation both rules and map gfx.

Big game, a great system for portraying divisional command. I love the way the spotting and Opp. fire rules can generate massive fire fights. A real thinkers game where you need to know your combined arms stuff and proper infantry tactics.

I wanted to like this game, however it is too slow playing (even small scenarios) and some rules are too cumbersome.

RATING: 10
For me this is the ultimate TCS game. Many of the smaller battles during the campaign are extremely interesting tactical situations, but what I love is the sense of understanding the battle much better playing it than reading about it. Wig Graves delivered a great game. And yes, I'm prejudiced since I was the developer ;-)

Playing this on Friendly Fire 2009 in Linköping, Sweden.

Edit: We had a great time with Scen 4.3. We didn't finish but the soviets gave up early in the day when two of his tank battalions failed morale just short of Mill Bridge.

Playing this online and solo right now. So great.

Took a long time to come out, I assume it's very polished. Sadly, the icons, while more intricate, have become less readable.  (But they managed to put all information on the counters along the same axis.)

Main problem is that the maps create a very awkward shape, I won't fit that on any table arrangement without major rearranging of furniture.  Will be very difficult to play the campaign.

After playing this game for dozens of hours and several other games with 4.0(1), I must say that the armor part of the new rules is really an improvement.  The infantry fight part however is seriously problematic.   Mortars have been castrated, rifle(!) fire has been added to bolster the MG-based unit ratings, is now a major factor and adds fiddliness to nearly every combat.  Where assaults used to be a method of last resort, they are now the standard method to overwhelm defenders with numbers.  This is what you get when a game system where the original designer said "this is all about the command system" is reworked by a group whose opinion leaders state they are mainly interested in tactical play.  Strange and historically inappropriate chrome suddenly comes to the fore.  Oh, well.  It's good that the games take so long. After spending 15+ hours just playing the two opening day scenarios, I don't think the campaign is a realistic ftf prospect.

My first venture into TCS.  Like many of The Gamers lines, it is an outstandingly thought through design.  I hesitated for a long time on TCS (who needs it if you know and love ASL?) before realising it is a completely different beast than ASL.  This battle is right at the heart of my interest in the Great Patriotic War:  the Red Army emerging from the darkness of the first 16 months of the German invasion, but not yet able to overwhelm the invading army at the time and place of its choosing (that would come later).

Eastern Front game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A monster Eastern front showcase for TCS, but with viable one map scenarios. Emphasis on maneuver, not slugfest, but even so expect a large dead pile. T-34s, Marders, Katyushas, massive artillery, 88s, air support, snow, even a POW platoon--it's all here. Minimal errata. Get it before it goes OOP.

Really like the changes made to the latest edition rules.  Sadly for me, the new style counters are so ugly they cause me physical pain.  quite a contrast to the earlier game series counters, which were among the very best counters ever made, basically a perfect balance between beauty and utility.

have to admit that one of the reasons I ordered this one (aside from the 4.0 rules set) is the updated art - great idea to bring Nicolás Eskubi in to freshen things up.  I'm sure Wig's research is as good as ever and Lee's development will stand up to many playings.

Very long, intense, sometimes frustrating and there are a couple of points I don't fully agree with, but the combination of the historical maps, unusual hybrid scale and clever thought out rules make this game hard to top.

Some of the mechanisms like the ones dealing with combined arms, supression, spotting or reaction fires are top notch. Few games drive home the importance and sheer dominating power of the artillery likes TCS does.

I received this from the publisher MMP when they sent me this game in error instead of the game I ordered. It arrived June 03rd, 2016. It looks very good and I'll take a closer look at it when I have the proper time to look at it thoroughly. For now, it'll remain in the shrink wrap. Thank you MMP.

Not played yet. I like *very much* both the counters and map artwork. IMHO, a step forward in the series in this aspect. My aging eyes would appreciate 5/8" instead of 1/2" counters.

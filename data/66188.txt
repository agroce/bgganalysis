--IMHO Modules 1 and 3 (portraits and Brown/Pink colors) are essential, even with new players. 
--add in Module 2 (Bishop's request) with anyone who has played at least once. 
--For more experienced players ADD Module 6 (Glaziers), Module 9 (Wall Fresco), and the Queenie (Bishop's Favor).

RATING: 7
3-14-14: I love games with a good theme and mechanics that work well around it. This one is one of the best in that regard.

8-17-15: Played it again for the first time in nearly a year, and it did not hold up as well as I remembered it. The dummy player for the 2 player version is a bit tedious to keep track of, though not nearly as difficult as many other games. I don't know. I'm sure it plays better as a 3 or 4 player game, but it's been years since I played with more than two. I should drop this to a 6 level, but I'm keeping it at 7 for old time's sake. This may be a candidate for trade later this year.

9-9-15: Traded for Hammer of the Scots in DFW Nerd Night Math Trade.

Played it wrong the first time through, played correctly it goes much better.  I wouldn't say that it offers anything amazing or original, but it is a very pretty game with a lot of choices to be made throughout.

RATING: 7
This is a rating of the 2 player experience. Have a feeling that the game would be significantly better with 3 or 4 players.

EDIT: Having played with three players (and the three expansions that were included in the box) I raise this from a 6 to a 7. It's a family game, but with the expansions added it's more of a challange.

RATING: 8
Yet another worker placement game, but this one works well as it has a very well-integrated theme, and several modular expansions that improve overall gameplay.

The goal of the game is to score the most points before the game ends, and there are several ways to do this: 1) the main way is to complete portions of the Cistine chapel, 2) some of the portait cards score small points, 3) every 2$ scores a point at game end, 4) fulfulling the bishop's requests will score one time points and award paint every round at the cost of income earned, 5) completing stained glass windows, 6) gaining the favour of the bishop scores additional points when painting.  The game ends when there are 6 or less portions to be painted and/or there are only 2 portraits to complete (it ends in this round).

There are some somewhat original decisions to make, like what time to wake up (wake up early, get the best paints but pay a premium), like whether or not you want happy workers at the expense of generally missing out on turn order and "wasting" an action at the theatre, and whether to jump ahead or stay behind in scoring for turn order (similar to the scoring mechanic in Torres).  Each round you plan where your workers will go (secretly) after turn order has been established; you can go to market to purchase paints, the cathedral to paint the cathedral, complete stained glass windows to score points, 3) you can paint side job portaits for money and/or points and special abilities, 4) you can mix paint to create more varied and valuable colours, 5) go to the theatre to improve the mood of your workers and pontentially gain a bonus worker.

There are 3 built-in expansions that come with the game, as well as the Glaziers expansion, which includes 3 other expanions.  I can't imagine playing this game without the expansions, it would be far too fluffy.  But with the expansions it becomes an accessible gamer's game.  The scalability from 2-4 players is quite good, except you have to play with a dummy player in 2player, but the dummy actually works fairly well.  Not sure this should have been the DSP winner, but it's a very solid design, despite the fact that it's yet another worker placement game.  Very impressive for a first design for these designers as well.

Own the [boardgame=85925]Glaziers[/boardgame], [boardgame=86048]Scrolls[/boardgame], [boardgame=109140]Bishop's favour[/boardgame], and [boardgame=148289]Bells[/boardgame] expansions.

110531 Its pretty, but I think worker placement games stress me out our something.  I'm not sure its the fault of the game but I'd rather play Agricola or PR or try a newer worker placement type game than play this again.

I think what I've realized is that I'm just not fond of simultaneous worker selection that has consequences.  In RFtG you still get your bonus (its a matter of letting other people do or not do actions), but I don't like that extra layer of "punishment" if you misplay your actions.   For some reason I find it very similar to Dungeon lords in that way.

Could well be a 4 if I played it more and if I wasn't so fond of the theme/artwork.

[I]tl;dr - Fresco is a lightweight action-selection game that's solid, but ultimately forgettable.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

I'd heard that Fresco hits the same high notes that [thing96913][/thing] did, so I picked it up in hopes of finding another winner from Queen Games. I found a good game (it's definitely a cut above mediocre garbage such as  [thing=219359][/thing] and [thing=182189][/thing]), but not one good enough that I wanted to own, or even really play again. 

I enjoyed the turn order track and the action selection -- it was interesting. Similarly, the different modules look good. But the base game, as it was, was far too simple and the decisions seemed obvious many times. 

Probably, the original Fresco was intended to be played with all three of the 'expansion' modules found in the base box, and the publisher stripped these out in an attempt to make a family-weight game. We did play with the brown and pink paints, but skipped the other two additions. 

Adding those in could make a difference, but I ultimately [i]did[/i] want a nice family-weight game, and base Fresco is not that experience. Perhaps my expectations were off -- it's entirely likely that Fresco with expansions is quite comparable to something like Lancaster, but in the end, my first experience of it was not enough to convince me to keep it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
Play with all of the expansion modules. Don't waste time with the "basic" game. Not a bad play... seems very balanced with a theme that is interesting. Underlying it all is a math puzzle whereby one must estimate the expected returns for a number of interesting options. All in all, an enjoyable experience.

like: good planning is rewarded. fun theme.
dislike: I was expecting something gentle, but it's a little cutthroat. ghost player for two-players is fiddly and sometimes I forgot to plan in the ghost player. ghost player can be used to shut down another player from the market.
overall:: not bad, but I think the game may be better with 3 or more people, and an expansion (of which there are many) to prevent being blocked from the market. rating could go up.

RATING: 6.5
Fun worker placement with some original concepts and wonderfully fresh theme makes for absolute joy in gaming. Family version loved by the family, but the expansions add to the interest and open alternate strategies. However, even with these, the strategy remains shallow and simple. Though the decisions are tense, it feels perhaps too simplistic in the end. Still, good (enough) game and will continue to play.

Not quite freshco any more. Basically you just send workers to gather resources and turn them into victory points. Mechanically and thematically everything works fine and the game is fun to play. Gamers, like myself, might long for possibilities to execute longer term strategies. In other words, in Fresco the play is very tactical and your decisions have very little impact on the course of the game.

Might use this as an introduction to worker placement games.

I didn't enjoy this quite as much as I hoped thnat I would.  It's a bit Pillars of Earthy-light, I guess.  I prefer it to that game as it seems to have more life.

Beautiful art design.  We've found the included expansions (other than the expansion that adds pink and brown paints) to detract from the game rather than add to it.

For those playing along at home, that's Job getting the water dumped on him while he shakes his fist at the burning building.  

I haven't tried any of the other numerous modules made for the game that didn't come in the original box.  I find I like the space [i]Fresco[/i] fills as it is--adding modules to make it more complex or involved would likely just put this into a space where there are other games I'd prefer to play more.

A very good game which does a better job than most of getting the mechanics to fit the theme. Still, it feels a little flat, which keeps it from getting a higher score.

RATING: 8.84
It is a "classical" worker placement game with attributes I was looking for: not too long (like Anachrony, Agricola), easy to teach (a gateway game), can be a deep game (by adding modules). The theme is nice and family-friendly. The most interesting mechanic is placing your workers simultaneous in secret (somehow similar to Dungeon Petz) on your personal game board. Moreover, there is no blocking of workers which I really like: you decide at which time all of your workers will do their actions (early in the morning or late in the evening) which defines the initiative (first come, first serve).

FAVOURITE GAME - it is a classic worker placement game, where you have to finish the fresco of a cathedral. To do so, you will have to decide what time your workers wake up for the day. The earlier you wake up, the earlier you will be in turn order, and the better options you will be guaranteed to have. Then you send your workers to buy dye, to paint portrait (for money), to mix colours, and to paint a portion of the fresco, to satisfy the bishop (which can award you extra points of victory). The box contains so called modules to make the game harder and suitable for more experienced players, otherwise it is a perfect family game.

1st play: A very visually impressive game.  The mechanics are straightforward and easy to grasp, while feeling like a race game.  There are elements in here that remind me of Scoville, and I like that game but feel like it's a little too long sometimes to play with the family.  The built in expansions add just enough to make the game interesting and the hidden workers with the reveal make timing very important.

2nd play: Played this again and it was well received.  Everyone seems to like it and it is one step simpler than Scoville.  I really like how easy it is to explain and very accessible to artsy gateway gamers.

One of those role selection euros that has a 'pick a wave' feel to it, in that it feels as though you're in essence trying to be out of phase with most other players to clean up on cheap resources (buying paints when they aren't, in particular).  On the whole, I'm not very fond of games in which the best path to victory is to do that little dance, but this one isn't too bad.

A worker placement game, DRIPPING WITH THEME! Everything you do has a sense, theme-wise: you decide when to wake your workers (too early, you might lose one; later, you might receive one); you buy colors (cubes), you mix primary colors to get other colors, you use colors to paint the fresco, you pay the bishop to come and see your work closely; you paint other paintings to receive benefits or money; you send your workers to the theater to relax......WOW!
I love it and I can't wait to get more plays!
...it might have a problem with a runaway leader and not being to tight...

The usual passive-aggressive irritation of worker placement + a really rather dry and boring cubes-to-other-cubes-to-VP conversion game.  I prefer Keythedral, which I didn't actually like.  Heck, Keythedral is prettier, too (this is a nice looking game, but it ain't that great).

Overall solid game. The action programming decisions aren't incredibly deep, but they are fun. I especially like the paint mixing to make resources! 

Base game requires that all "expansion modules" be played. Without all the "expansions in the box" in play, it really is a hollow shell of itself. It's like they arbitrarily stripped out three pieces of the game to call the extra modules "expansions." Very silly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros
- The theme of painting fits the worker placement game and cubes, unlike many others
- Colorful cubes and board
- Wake up mechanic and first dibs is fun to play back and forth along with mood of your workers
- Interesting decisions
- A good play time (1 hour and change)
- Add all the expansions in for fun, or don't. It's customizable that way. 
- Accessible to non-gamers and still requires long term strategy 
- An insert that has art on it. Pretty cool.

Cons
- You don't have to finish the fresco to trigger end game, which is weird for a game about painting a fresco

For some reason, I love the theme of painting (not painting, literally, but a painting-oriented board game like this one, where you are acquiring paint, etc.), and needing to mix paints to complete certain parts of a painting.  I love the simplicity of the game, how it plays in a relatively short time period and how it's well-balanced insofar as you will need to visit all areas of the board.  I love the opposition of happiness with waking up early (I can relate!), and the constant dilemma that needing to choose one presents.  I can't really think of much I don't like, but I need to play the game more...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice environment family friendly game, where there's player interaction, but you can also do things by yourself. The theme makes it fun to play if you are in an "Italian" mood and you make the accent and you pretend you're restoring some famous basilica and ... if your friends are actually laughing.

Overall, it can be a strategical game, but it's much more fun to play it as a party game, even if you don't win you get to laugh a lot.

Update: after one more play, I find it a lightweigh euro with quite little to offer for experienced players. Can be 'safely' played once or twice, afterwards it is boring

A solid, enjoyable Euro but I'm not this games intended audience. A couple of reasons why...

1. Caylus perfected Euros.

2. The game has a retard the players doing well, help the stragglers mechanism. I can ride a bike I don't need stabilisers.

3. With the mechanism above in play, you are pushed towards memorising hidden but trackable information to excel. To excel in Snap you could card count, is it worth the effort?

4. Queen Games, you insulted me by calling parts of the base game 'expansions'.

5. Stay up late and switch on a shopping channel. You'll see some ripped strong men and women trying to sell you some gimmicky home gym equipment, a shaky stick, electronic ab pads, a vibrating step... Fresco. Do yourself a favour put that TV remote down and get yourself to the gym... Caylus.

Deceptive family game in that while it may have some very simple rules, the gameplay is packed with a lot of subtle strategy.  I can't suggest this to new gamers as other worker placement titles like Stone Age are for more accessible, but it is a great choice for people looking for a step up from gateway games.  The components are fantastic and the gametime plays as advertised, more or less around an hour, even when adding the modules.  And the theme is pretty well realized in this making the rules easier to comprehend.  Overall a fantastic package which can be made as simple or complex as one desires.  Plays 2-4 players but I think it's best with 4 (and if you're looking for a good two player game, you might want to look elsewhere).

Fun little euro with hidden action selection, worker placement mechanics.  Has a minor bit of resource management in the acquisition and mixing of paint.

A fresh theme as far as euro games are concerned

RATING: 8
A little light, but lots of fun and has a decent amount of strategy.  Originally thought that there would be battles over the later wake-up times, but after I got a point lead, I found myself locked out of the early wake up times and few useful things to do with my extra apprentice.  Want to try with the included expansions.

I wonder what got us interested in trying this one? If you guessed Richard Ham you are correct! Curse that man and his love of Eurogaming. Were it not for him we wouldn't have half the games  we do. LOL. But he's backed a winner with Fresco. There is a lot of set up to it but at least you have something very pretty to look at once you're done. At its heart Fresco is worker placement and resource management at its simplest. We love the way it all coalesces into painting that beautiful fresco to score the points you need. There are just 2 things keeping this from a 10. 1) All the expansions. You really don't need them. They truly just add complexity for complexity's sake. Mind you we are saying this from a non-die-hard Eurogamer POV. So take that for what you will. 2) The Leonardo dummy player that is used in the 2-player game. We have no problem with dummy players in some games (Mage KNight and Pergamon) when they move independently. But a dummy player whose actions are controlled by the players is not a dummy player. No matter what you call it the dummy is a part of your strategy and it can be  a part of that strategy you plan for. Luckily we have devised a way for Leonardo to move on his own. Yes. It is random and involves dice so we can hear the die-hard Euros screaming once more but we prefer it to the designer's way because it actually makes him a "dummy" player not a part of the players' strategy.

Great worker placement game of varying complexity depending on whether you use expansion modules that come with the base game. This is something more game designers should think about.

Unique, fun theme of painting a fresco on a cathedral ceiling. Simultaneous hidden action selection reduces downtime and keeps players guessing as they try to anticipate their opponents' moves. Choosing player order which thematically changes your workers' moods and market price is really clever.

Here's a game that got some attention and then got robbed.  The theme of the game is unique (at least as of the time it was released) and the theme is worked into the mechanics very well.  The game plays faster than expected but doesn't leave you feeling like you missed out on play opportunity.  When it's all said and done, you'll find yourself looking back and thinking what ifs.  And you'll be planning for the next play.  Add in the excellent production quality and you have a title that probably deserved to win the SdJ.  Definitely a nice game visually and in actual play.  I'm pretty happy with this one.

I like the theme and all the moving parts. I also think this could be useful in an educational setting. I have yet to play with the expansions - I am hoping that they will present more of a challenge to this otherwise medium-light weight game.

Update: the expansions make it feel very busy in a way that feels like your boss just keeps giving you more tasks to undertake. They are well-integrated, I will say that, but make the game too long for what it ultimately is: a medium-weight family game.

Painting a ceiling by acquiring paint from a market, mixing it and then going painting. When you choose to "get up" dictates what you pay for paint, but also what paint might be available as the opponents up earlier get to take paint first. It also dictates who paints a section first and you may find that what you were going to paint is already claimed.
Has an interesting turn order mechanism, where when you would score points to tie with an opponent you actually place on the space ahead or behind. Whoever is behind on points gets to choose when they get up the next round.

This game feels a lot more tactical than strategic; the base game feels very friendly at first, but it can get pretty cutthroat, and with all the modules the spread of big scoring opportunities allows for blocking your opponent to have serious impact. That's a good thing in my mind, but it does make the game something other than what I'd expected of it. Has a lot of staying power, as the game has a different balance each time when varying the mix of modules from game to game.

Very good game.  Quite thematic, and engaging throughout.  Scope for impacting your opponents,  but never catastrophically.  Expansions add quite a bit of complexity and time, but the money cards are fairly low-impact, while adding a bit of variation.  The extra colours add quite a bit of extra thinking, and may be too much initially.

Un precioso y divertido juego. El tema es conseguir pintar la mayor parte de un fresco de Iglesia. Y para hacerlo necesitamos que nuestra cuadrilla de ayudantes nos consigan los colores necesarios en el mercado y conseguir dinero (para poder pagarlos) a través de algún retrato a particulares. Si el ambiente que reina entre nuestra cuadrilla es bueno podemos aumentar el número de ayudantes, de la misma manera que si tenemos a nuestros ayudantes enfadados puede ser que perdamos alguno...

La ventaja del Fresco es que disfrutan tanto jugones como no jugones. La mecánica de colocación de trabajadores una vez más, solo que con un tema muy visual. Muy fácil de explicar, facil de entender y de aprehender. El juego básico se queda muy soso pero con las tres miniexpansiones que incluye el propio juego queda un juego redondo, fácil y con enjundia. Para mí un puntazo.

A rather nice game, but it's way too light for the time it takes, in my opinion. The paint mixing is a very interesting mechanism, and it does have an interesting mix of other mechanisms that I enjoy (the "recipe fulfilling" aspect and the "how early will you rise" stage, in particular), but it's too long for what it offers.

A well-themed Euro. Great fun, good balance. Love the modular design (expansions, etc.), and the mechanic (worker placement-ish: buy paints, mix paints, use paints to redeem tiles for points). Great idea to let the players choose to go first by taking penalties (the wake-up time list).

+ Very thematic worker placement game. 
+ The basic game is very easy to teach and so a nice gateway game.

Nehéz véleményt mondanom az alapjátékról, mert csak kieggel együtt játszottam, és elég jelentős hányadát a kieg tette ki. Ha elképzelem lecsupaszítva, a nagy kockák, ablakok, aranyazás nélkül az alapokat... hát valószínűleg teljesen más kategória. De így mindenestől nekem nagyon bejött! Valószínűleg a kieg felfelé húzza a játékot, számomra legalábbis érdekesek voltak a plusz elemek.
Vicces az a koránkelős rész:) De életszerű, ki a fene tudna reggel 6-kor festeni.
Szívesen játszanék egyszer majd külön az alappal is, bár lehet, hogy akkor lefelé mozdul a pontszám.

The basic Fresco gameplay is quite straightforward: it is clearly a game targeted to families (with just the base game, my rating would be just a 6). When using the additional modules (using them is recommended: they don't add much complexity ruleswise!), everything becomes more interesting (my rating is a 7 for the "complete" game).
The production value is top notch, as usual for Queen.
While being a (quite traditional) euro game, the theme is present and well implemented by the mechanics.
Fresco is an enjoyable game, and I am happy I finally added it to my collection.

Easy to learn / teach to beginners and the game mechanics are well integrated with the theme.  I really "enjoy" the struggle between waking up early or late.  Waking up early sets you in a better position in obtaining paints and you have better choices in completing portion of the Fresco.  However, it means costing more for the paints and making your apprentices not willing to work.  That is the main mechanic of the game and I found it quite interesting.

Beautiful game and a really fun theme.  The game is easy enough to introduce to new players but has enough depth for board game veterans.  Each of the actions are intuitive and makes you feel like you are managing the painting project.

A euro with a pretty well implemented theme is not something you see every day. But Fresco fits this description. The theme makes the game easy to learn and explain as all the actions make sense. Some gamey elements like the bishop are included, but this can be forgiven. Besides the theme the gameplay is very good also. Players are always trying to do the best they can with the limited money and resources they can gather and have to plan their actions well. The base game is also pretty accesable and even suited for family play. The included expansions are rumoured to increase the difficulty and shift the game more to the experienced gamers side. I wouldn't know as I haven't played with them yet.

Worker placement is one mechanism that I get the least excited about.  It seems that these games often lead to massive bouts of analysis-paralysis, and don't offer enough fun to equal the time you will invest in playing.  But Fresco breaks that mold.  By forcing players to place their workers without knowledge of where others will go, decisions are made considerably faster.  The theme is also remarkably well thought out.  Every one of the game mechanisms makes sense because people just get the idea of keeping your workers happy, mixing your paints and then painting.

I haven't attempted any of the expansions yet, but I can see how they will be easy to integrate into future games.  What I like about the basic game, though, is that it keeps the mechanisms nice and straightforward.  This will make the game very easy to teach to new players.  Then, as they become acclimated to the basic game, you can add expansions as quickly as you think the players will be able to adjust to them.  This kind of thing usually isn't my favorite (asking the players to decide how they want the game to play) but for some reason, in this case I like it.  I will try to add additional comments when I try the expansions.

Tried it again but with all 3 modules this time.  The game is considerably better.  The first play was good, but I didn't push to play it again.  Now, I could actually see myself asking to play this game with the 3 modules.  One player did run away with it, but I think that was just a matter of excellent management from him and poor management from us.  Good game.

Almost perfect Euro role/resource/build game.  The turn order / price to pay mechanic and the turn planning are fantastic.  And, the paint color as resource is fun and intuitive.

A point off for the obnoxious variants-that-shouldn't-be hassle, and a noticed issue where last place selecting first can maybe too heavily effect end-game.


(played with included expansion - I don't see why you wouldn't and it's actually kind of obnoxious that you have to read through two rulebooks and mentally merge rulesets for what should really be the standard ruleset, with the other being a basic variant, maybe for families or gamer newbies.)

Ezt a játékot sokáig nem akartam játszani, mert egyszerűen a téma nem tetszett. Mi az, hogy festünk? Aztán mégis csak kipróbáltam és mondhatom nem bántam meg. Jól felépített játék, melyet a modulokkal még bonyolítani is lehet. A játékidő közepes. Itt láttam először azt a kezdőjátékos mechanikát, melyben bizony az első helyért komoly lemondásokkal kell szembenéznünk. Van benne egy jókora tippelgetés is, mikor titokban kiválasztják a játékosok hova küldik az embereiket dolgozni, majd van nagy bosszankodás, hogy miért nem mentünk oda, hisz senki nem választotta. Ez a játék szerintem kötelező darab a polcon, mert elég széles közösségnek lehet megtanítani. Nekem mind a három modul tetszik melyet az alapdobozba tettek.

Family game with a hidden action-selection mechanism and a modular setup, allowing you to choose the desired level of complexity according to the age of players and the time available. That also makes it a great gateway game to get people into "serious" gaming. Absolutely gorgeous artwork. It doesn't involve much strategy, though some planning ahead is required. I don't feel there is that big of an edge for experienced players, which is a plus for what the game is. All in all, it's lots of fun.

Took a chance on this title when I picked it up.  Thought the box and theme were appealing.

Don't regret spending a dime!

Had a blast playing it, and while there is a "lot going on"...once you start to play, it all falls together and is a fun and smooth experience.

An abstract-like but interesting "hidden" worker placement and set collection game.  The basic game is pretty good.  I'm anxious to try some of the expansions.  I agree with some comments about not being able to build up many "wow" moves in the base game... not sure if that's a bad thing since a balanced game with everyone close in terms of VP is supposed to be ideal, right?

UPDATE: The expansions included with the base game are pretty good.  I like the "portrait painting" cards as an alternative to taking 3 coins.  Fresco is largely a game of tactics with some light strategy.  It can be a bit of a brain burner at times since there are a lot of little things you can do on a given turn and since the timing of your actions is important.

This game has a ton going for it: great bits, two-sided board, family rules plus expert rules, VP track management, hidden resources and money as well as simultaneous hidden action selection (to minimize AP)...  DEFINITELY play this with all of the original options for the best game.

Very beautiful game with the theme. But it is too simple even with three expansions. It is a great game for the family I guess. Whole project is based on chart with many colors You have to put together to get other colors You can use to paint fresco or pictures and get points.

Scoville is better.

RATING: 7.5
This is a set collection game with a light veneer of theme, mixed with some hidden worker placement.  It's quite light, though it starts to head towards medium weight when you add the three included mini-expansions.  The game certainly does not take a great amount of advanced planning, nor does it really allow for it, but it's fun none-the-less.  I don't imagine that it's going to get played even on a monthly basis, but I'm happy to have it and know that I can take it our for some light gaming fun when required!

Can't really lay down any sort of strategy as it is very tactical in nature.  Still is a nice game and I like how a few expansion modules come with the game to make it a tad more interesting and complex.  Offers plenty of choices but I think it is too lacking of any long term strategy for an experienced gamer to enjoy.  I only get this out as a gateway for new gamers.

Cada jugador lleva a un pintor y cinco ayudantes. El turno se divide en varias fases: primero se madruga, lo que equivale a situarse en una tabla horaria, que determina cómo afecta al estado de ánimo de los trabajadores y el precio al que puedes comprar colores en el mercado. Tras esa fase, cada jugador debe planificar de forma oculta el resto del turno... asignando acciones a tus trabajadores. Después se va al mercado y se compra al precio estipulado. Luego viene la colaboración en el fresco de la catedral. El estudio te permite conseguir dinero. El taller permite obtener colores compuestos,mezclando colores primarios. Por ultimo el teatro eleva el ánimo de los trabajadores y puede reportarte un trabajador extra para el turno siguiente.
El juego termina cuando finaliza la ronda en la que sólo quedan 6 losetas del fresco por dibujar. Es un juego de gestión de recursos sencillo y familiar, pero requiere planificación que aporta profundidad al juego. Recomendable. Solo lo he probado a dos jugadores (en cuyo caso hay un jugador ficticio). Intuyo que lo suyo es jugar al menos tres.

Rating feels solid, following a lively first session competing for those premier victory point restorations on the fresco. After deciding turn order with the get up time, the action order changes. This has an important impact on the turn for getting the necessary paint purchases, money that will be spent, and who will get the best restorations (points) and possibly portrait advantages. Quite fun decision making worker placement game with no bidding or dice rolling. Seems to appeal to many different strokes of gamer types. Very well balanced game with alternating turn order. Excellent. UPDATE: Added expansion 3 with 1 (Portraits) and felt it helped spread out the scoring with the higher tiles. New paints add a little time, needed for calculating blending extra paints. UPDATE: Played all three expansions, adding 2nd expansion, Bishop's Request, making this more of a gamers game. Must consider with this expansion: what tiles to restore to get bishop tiles; value of bishop tiles received in the exchange; and paint rewards of bishop tiles. Rated medium for all three base expansions, and a 9 with expansions 2 and 3. UPDATE: Expansions 4,5,6 (Glaziers) raise this to a 10 (I don't own the Scrolls exp.). A work of art!

Neat, solid and beautiful worker-placement.
It fits the same spot as Village and although I like Village's theme and the time-mechanic more Fresco is for some unknown reason more appealing to me.

I like it that you gather a ressource and process it further so that you get a different ressource that you can use later on. Maybe that's the main reason I like these two games.

I am unfortunately starting to tire of these euro-blah games with their worker placement and little victory point tracks and tiles...  This game reminds me of so many other games that it feels a little generic.  It's a little stone age, and royal palace, and di vinci, etc etc.   

Still, the mixing of paint is somewhat fun and it's certainly a well put together game.   Just wish there was a little more innovation.

Fresco is a fine game - nothing terribly new as far as mechanics go, but a nice blend.  The base game, without the expansions, is a little blah, certainly fine for family play, but otherwise, it makes sense to add the expansions as soon as you can.  This one reminds me of Keythedral, although not as linear (or cutthroat) as that one.

One of the only Euro games that actually makes little wooden cubes both functional and thematic. The blind worker-placement mechanic works well, and I love how the turn order influences both the number of workers a player has as well as the cost of goods at the market. Leonardo in the two-player game is the best dummy player I have seen, making this one of my favorite two-player euros.

This game went over a lot better than it sounded like it would. After reading the rulebook, it sounded like a soul-less euro that would have all of the endearing warmth of a spreadsheet.

RATING: 6
Played with all the expansions.  As a gamer, I can't imagine not playing with them all, but that's one of the great draws of this game.  With or without expansions, you can make it either an extremely simple game, all the way up to a somewhat interesting game for gamers.

Overall, I thought it was alright, but overall it's pretty much your basic collect cubes, convert them into other cubes, and trade them into points type of game.  Some interesting decisions come into play with the turn order mechanic, and managing what place you're in can be critical.  This adds a little tension to the game that kicks it up a notch.

However, in the end, it pretty much stacks up evenly against other cube-pushers in my collection, with nothing to really make me want to play it over the others.  It's a good game, but it's unlikely I'll think of it very often on game day.

Not sure about this one. Might be too heavy/fiddly for our group.

I like the theme - assistants that wake up early get more done, but if they have to wake up early too often, they get disgruntled.

It was one of Jenefer Ham's runners-up for her top 10 board game list. It was also a Spiel des Jahres nominee in 2010. I thought I'd pick it up when I found it for cheap.

I ended up trading this game away. It sat on the shelf for half a month, and every time that I looked at the game, there was something else that I'd rather play.

I ended up trading it for Kanagawa and $5.

Based on 1 play with 5 players:

Pretty fun! It's been awhile since I tried a good light Euro. Not a lot new here, but everything is simple and smooth.

The fact that the person in last place always chooses first makes for an interesting rubber band mechanic... and it's a small thing, but I also really like that when you land on the same square on the VP track as someone you can choose to go higher or lower... really makes that work just a little bit better, I think.

The wake-up-time vs. apprentice-happiness mechanic is also fun... it's one of those rare things that's both strategically interesting AND thematically amusing.

Looking forward to more plays!

This is an excellent light eurogame! It's a game I like to introduce to people who have just played Stone Age as it's about the same difficulty. It's an entirely different game than SA and PotE and other worker placement games, and I think it is a game that fans of lighter WP games should own. Also, I need to say that it's nothing at all like Pastiche (which I also think is a great game) which some people claim. Sure, there are colors in both games and you need to get most victory points in the end, but that's it...

The mechanics aren't ordinary worker placement in the sense that everybody can go to every spot, but you do it in turn order, so you're not sure if the stuff you need will be gone (unless you're first player). And you're not sure if it's gone because you don't know if other players will go there because, at the start of the round, each player secretly decides where to go - so a big part of the game isn't really worker placement but rather simultaneous action selection. That's a pretty cool mechanic I think, though it can screw you over if somebody else takes what you need - but I guess you could just have planned for that! The mechanic about turn order is brilliant: wake up time! If you wake up early, you will be first at everything, but your meeples will be unhappy and you have to pay more... It's a great balance.

The box includes 3 "expansions", but I really think you need to play with all of them as it's just more fun and adds more decisions to be made; two more colors to mix and get more points from, portraits you can get other stuff than money from and finally you can do one other thing when you're mixing paints: merge 3 fresco tiles you've restored earlier in order to get some points and also a free paint each turn. 

There are also a bunch of other expansions for this game that you can mix and match however you like, so I think the replayability is good. The added complexety means that more experienced gamers will also find this game fun and challenging; however, there ARE better eurogames out there. I bought Fresco when I started playing board games, and it was great, but since then I've played better and more challenging/brain burning eurogames which I would rather play.

Not much new here, but what it does it does pretty well.  It just seems very rehashed to me.  The interesting bit is allocating your dudes to what actions you want to take that turn, so it involves a little pre-programming. The other worthwhile grace of this is how turn order is selected, and going first can cost you actions, while going last can cause you a bad selection but more actions.  Overall, I'd be willing to play again with no problem, but I don't think I'd ever ask to play it.

One of the best basic worker placement games around with a well designed theme!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial rating an 8. Fresco does a lot of things right. The theme is fun and matches the mechanics very well. Turn order matters, and it's cleverly balanced with a penalty for "early morning" work, and also more expensive prices in the market. The game is tight, it's probably a bit heavy for a straight-up "family game," but I'm impressed.

A random thought--this is not a worker placement game, as the way you delegate your "assistants" does not block other players.

Another random thought -- this blows Stone Age out of the water. Two attractive games of similar weight, but where Stone Age is uninteresting and bland point grabbing, Fresco forces interesting choices in each phase of a round. In Stone Age, you can build a hut of pure gold (???). In Fresco, you get to mix paints, choose your wakeup time, and all other things that make so much more thematic sense.

Update: Traded this away, but I still like it. I just realized that I had played the game a few times, and it was never with my copy. I'll happily play but I don't need to own.

Si te gustaron Vasco da Gama, Egizya,  Stone Age, Un mundo sin fin...  este es tu juego. Es un juego que como ya he comentado sin aportar nada nuevo al panorama lúdico mezcla muy bien un sinfín de mecánicas ya vistas y te hace muy agradable el jugarlo. Cada vez me gustan más los juegos que tienen un "aproach" para todo tipo de público no solo para jugones, este lo puedes sacar en cualquier reunión y quedas bien, mi mujer que es no jugona le gustó solo con verlo (otra cosa será que la vuelva a convencer par jugarlo ;-). Además es un juego que como los anteriores que he nombrado mientras juegas te lo estas pasando bien, sin generarte estress.

This game just keeps growing on me.  Finally played it with all the expansions and I think it may go up to a 10 soon.  It is just a fun game that makes very logical sense.  Get up earlier, get exactly done what you want, but be cranky about it.  Sleep in, enjoy life.  Buy paint, mix paint, use paint, score points.

R's  This is a worker placement game that involves set collection, with some thematic twists.  Sets of cubes representing paints of particular colors are purchased in the market.  Particular sets can later be "mixed" into other colors (e.g. yellow+red=orange).  Sets of colors are used to purchase tiles in the cathedral.  This reveals a section of the fresco that the paints have been used to create.  Workers placement is performed secretly and simultaneously, except for one.  This worker is used to show how early the apprentices are forced to begin their day.  Start time has a direct relationship with turn order resolution and relates indirectly with paint prices.  It also has the affect of in/decreasing happiness which can lead to gaining or losing a worker.

I was hoping this would be a great game for my art-loving wife and daughter, but sadly I don't think so. It's a total cube pusher. I found the spacial aspect to the board really just doesn't add much.

Great theme, and looks good. May be better off getting a different worker placement game (Carson City) in terms of variation on mechanics. May be too similar to Stone Age.

I've been meaning to add a comment here for nearly three years now, and in the meantime I've forgotten most of the (single) experience I've played this game. I recall it being a family-friendly worker placement game with a phenomenally thematic conversion of 'the early bird catches the worm'. This single-handedly creates an immediately understandable and recognisable tradeoff between effort and free resources, and makes this part of the game very accessible. The rest is, as has been demonstrated very succintly, forgettable.

I've always meant to retry the game at some point, but noone I know brings it to the table, thus causing the game to lead a certain twilight existence.

Neat, easy to learn euro style game.  Players work to collect various pigment type cubes for the fresco.  Good dynamic for secretly allocating your artists each turn behind a screen.  The expansions add a little bit of "meat" to this simplistic board game.  Fresco is fun to play with very little down time.  All sorts of people tend to like to play Fresco.

This is a resource management game that is remarkably clever in that it's easy to understand, but your choices are complex.  The mechanism of wake-up time is a great innovation, and the mixing of colors is a strong thematic choice.  On the whole I think this is a good, solid game that will have broad appeal.

The modules for this game integrate very nicely, and once you've tried them it's hard to imagine never using them again.  The tertiary colors are a no-brainer, and the additional choices you face with the portraits and the special requests are interesting.  The game as a whole is much improved and now I want to play it more often!

This is very flavorful and thematic game which does very well in simulating the work of renewing the fresco in Renaissance church. There game mechanics are nicely applied to the theme - you will buy colors at the marked, mix them to create another colors, painting not only the fresco wall at the church, but also personal portraits of some nobles from the city to gain more income (yes, even in Renaissance guys have second jobs :) ) and after work you can visit theater to relax.
Sound interesting? For sure. This game is very interesting. 

What I like:
- Wake time selection mechanism is great. It serves both as the leader issue elimination (wake time is chosen from the least points to the highest points player) and also as interesting strategic decision (do I wake early, when everything at the market, fresco, etc. is still available, but the prices are high and I will be tired (morale will decrease)? Or should I sleep longer, be fresh, but I would probably need to take the rest of stuff nobody other wants - although for cheaper?)
This is one of the main attractions of the game
- The AI player (Leonardo) is designed very cleverly. It is used in 2 player games (my only game player count), each player controls him every second round and it serves nicely to block in all parts of the game (wake time selection, market, fresco, portraits, etc.) This adds even more variables into wake time selection (sorting A, B and Leonardo players according to the points and depending who controls Leonardo this turn).
- Game is modular - modules are sort of mini expansions which can be added into game independently to each other and provide wider game experiences. This idea is good and everybody can choose his own favorite combination (do you wanna play gateway game, add only few modules. Are you ready for richer and heavier experience? add more of them). I never tried game without any module as It was not recommended in forums (and I believe the game would be boring and with no interesting decisions). But after several games with only the base three modules (1 - The Portraits, The Bishop’s Request and Special Blend Colors ) I added also two of them from the expansion (8 - The Bells and 9 - The Wall Fresco) which was the sweet spot for me now.
- The theme is original and appealing for lot of non-gamer people. Also the game looks nice.

What I dislike:
- the cartoon tiles (market goods, tiles of fresco) are not very well produced. The tiles tend to get unstuck and overall they do not endure much.
- The setup and tear down could be a bit longer (according to the modules used). But this is usual games like this
- The game play may feel repetitive without many different strategies, it feels more tactical than strategic. This can be changed by adding some more modules, but still the core of the game is to buy colors, mix them and use them for painting the fresco. Repetitive, but it works somehow.

RATING: 7
The basic game is OK, but a bit too simple for me to stay interested long - and the competition for wake-up times seems so critical that I suspect this might be one of those timing-games where you want to stockpile potential and make sure you're (barely) in last place, then surge to first just as the game ends. (Some people love this dynamic - witness Power Grid - but I'm less fond of it.)

The included expansions add enough breadth-of-problem-space to make the game much more interesting to me, and differentiate player positions more (eg: player A has mixed pink; player B has an income of an Orange per round; etc) which improves the ability to guess what other players might do, and in turn plan a course to avoid being cut off by those plans. This makes the game a bit more strategic, and the order of choosing turn order just before endgame less critical.

First time playing a game with the worker placement mechanic.  Very beautiful looking pure Eurogame about Renaissance era artists in Italy painting the ceiling of a cathedral.  The re-imagining of the ubiquitous wooden blocks as pigments used to mix paint is cute and ingenious.  Game also employs some simultaneous action by having every player plan his worker placement behind screens at the same time - a very interesting mechanic that I found quite fun.  I find most eurogames to some degree mathematical exercises, though and this was no exception - but the game is so short (about 1 hr.) and has such interesting decision making that I would never turn down a game.  I came in 2nd place my first game!  I was a bit stunned as I was completely lost as to the proper strategy my first turn.

Was really enjoying our first play of the base game and then my brilliant "equivalent stepdaughter" pulled what evidently is known as the "Big Money" strategy and annihilated everyone on the last turn.

Supposing i had the need to show someone which are the virtues of modern "eurogames", i would suggest a game of Fresco.
Almost all the key elements of an eurogame are present here: the work placement, the set collection, the simultaneous action selection (programmed on player's mat), the grid movement, the bid (when choosing market), etc.
Fresco remains underated by core gammers because, i guess, they  view it as "too light": once the players get aquainted with it's mechanics, the game runs smoothly and can be over in just 60-90 min. 
Well, for me this is exactly the main virtue of this game: to be able to offer "so much" in such a compact and elegant form!

RATING: 6
The game isn't bad. I even like the theme. However there are so many better worker-placement games out there.
The unknown information which market tiles will be laid out is its biggest flaw. It makes the game too random over all and makes the mechanic of getting up early with your workers more trouble than it's worth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice medium-weight Euro with a pleasing theme for families. Has additional rules and components to add for more gaming goodness. 

Involves acquiring materials (paint, in this case) and converting that material into VPs. There is a big advantage to going earlier in turn order, but a drawback in that it may cause you to lose painters (your workers) and will also cost you more to buy paint at the market.

Although the box is much larger than it should be, the game board is pleasing to look at, and players expose the cathedral fresco as the game progresses, which is a nice feature.

Yet another in the current flood of worker placement games. In this case the pre-planning is stronger with an almost "Aladdin's Dragon's like" bluff & tension about whether you will get the paints you need to fulfil the goal.
There's also a subtle engine-building race behind the scenes as players gear up with more income & blended cubes earned each turn.
Pretty good stuff. Noting I've only played with all the advanced rules.

RATING: 8
We played the basic game and were stupefyingly bored. We played again with the first three expansion modules and were ... enchanted, or close to it. A central decision in the game is whether to ensure you go early in the turn order at the cost of paying more for paint and possibly losing an action. Without the modules, going early matters a lot in only one of the five areas of the board (and matters a little in one other area); with the modules, turn order makes a difference in four areas, so the trade-off decision and game are much more interesting.

A very attractive game, especially the board.  I enjoyed playing it, although in a 3-player game, I came in last by a very wide margin.

However, at the heart of it, it really is Just Another Worker Placement game.  Not bad, but nothing to get overly excited about, either.

Played at Gamefest South 2010. Very brain burny. I thought this would be a good family game but it is definitely a gamers game. Would play this one again if asked but it is more complex than I generally like to play for what you get out of the game. Update: Actually the more I think about this game, the more I like it. We played with all the expansions, I think the family would like the basic version and then move up from there.

A very good game. A must with all 3 expansions (maybe all but the extra colors for quicker, less complex play). There is a lot of game here.

Lots of pretty parts and neat individual ideas, but as a game it just completely fails.  Why paint anything before turn 8?  If you are in the lead, you will get no paint ever again.  Expect a fun filled time of sending three guys to the portrait studio as your one and only action very turn if you make the mistake of actually playing the game and scoring.  Whee!  Give me nine bucks and I'll go get a pop.

Dungeon Lords does the simo blind worker placement thing way better.

RATING: 7
Pretty standard fair of buying cubes with money to trade in for points.  But the theme kicks it up a point as the cubes represent colors.  You "mix" the colors to achieve rarer colors.  Use colors to collect points.  The rarer the color, the more points you get when you use it.  This game looks to have a low ceiling for me.  Even with the expansion, I'm not sure the theme is strong enough to keep it from the pile of mediocre.  Rating a 7 for now, will likely come down.

Players are Renaissance artists restoring the fresco on the ceiling of a cathedral.  Players spend turns sending out their apprentice artists to buy paints, work in the cathedral, earn income via portrait work, mix paints, and then go relax at the theatre!  Nice resource management game that is pleasant to play, looks glorious, and plays very well.  Three bolt on expansions are included that can be added right into games with experienced players.  I liked this one - thematically well connected and fun to play.

I like the fact that this game seems to be very balanced. A player who is in the lead will not be able to run away with the game and may actually lose in the last few turns depending on what the other player do. Some other games try to give advantages to the losing players, but I feel that his game actually pulls it off. Very few games let you come from behind to win without relying on luck or hidden points.

A light and simple worker-placement game where you collect sets of colored cubes, and then turn them in for points.  There is some jockeying for turn order, which affects market availability and prices.  So, there's a big chunk of this game which feels already familiar.  Workers are placed secretly behind your own screen, so there is no action blocking or fear of not getting something you want.   This might make it more approachable for families, but it lowers the tension level quite a bit.   The happiness meter allows you to possibly gain or lose an extra worker on a given round.   I prefer Agricola, or Stone Age, or Tribune to this, but I can see why it was an SdJ nominee.   Other than the color blending, the theme isn't quite as pervasive as what I've read in other reviews.  The end game snuck up on us quickly, so I'd have to play it some more to see if that's always an issue.

This is a great worker placement game.  It looks very busy when you get the whole thing set up, but it's not nearly that difficult.  There are a lot of options for what you can do on your turn, especially when you play with more modules.  I doubt this will ever leave my collection.

Előszörre csak az alapjátékot próbáltuk ki ketten. Hát lehet nem ez az ideális létszám, még nem néztem utána, de így kicsit száraznak éreztem az egészet. Legközelebb a kiegészítőkkel együtt kell tenni egy próbát, addig nem akarok véleményt alkotni. Ami viszont mindenképp tetszett benne, az a titkos akcióválasztás folyamata, mellyel előre el kell dönteni, hogy az adott körben mit csinálunk. Na most az előzetes tervünk körülbelül a piacnál meg is bukik :). Az az első akció a sorban :).(2015.06.15.)

Resource management game with a very well thought out theme. Moved quickly and had some interesting decisions - but feel there are better titles out there - outside of the outstanding theming, and more approachable mechanics, didn't see much here that would make me want to play this again. Would rather play caylus, agricola, tribune, etc.

Can see this could be a very good family game though - mini expansions are very clever.

  I was drawn in by the unique and interesting theme. We have played this with 4 before but most of our plays are w/ 2 and the dummy Leonardo. As far as dummy players Leonardo is not too bad. Simultaneous WP/action selection and set collection/resource management are the underlying mechanisms. I was a big fan of this after the first handful of plays but after getting in a half dozen or so plays has felt a little samey. We need to introduce the expansions to this. I have also found that I am not capable of beating my wife at this game. When she picks the game for the evening she is likely to pick this, which means Im likely to play even if I'd rather play something else.

Nos a szabály fordítás után megvolt az első játék is. Tetszik. A mennyire még kérdőjeles, valahol a 8 és 9 közt. Elsőre 8-t adtam, de ez nőhet, sőt valószínűleg nőni fog több játék után.
A játék maga: kellően összetett, ugyanakkor egyszerűbben is játszható, jól összerakott, és jó a téma is: freskó festés, ehhez persze festék szerzés, festék -szín- keverés, jó ötlet, h az akció sorrendjéről a felkelés ideje dönt, amit viszont az aktuális pont alapján, fordított sorrendben választanak meg a játékosok -azaz a leghátrébb álló először-. Szépen is van kidolgozva, Queen games minőség. Ugyanakkor igazán nagy újdonság nincs benne, de igen jól rakták össze már ismert ötletekből, és ez alapján egy érdekes jó, sokszor újra játszható játék született.

Very colorful. Enjoy the mechanic. Got the chance to let my friend borrow this game. Tried it with one of my best friends and my mother.

They enjoyed the game. My mother had a little difficultly, but in the end she understood the game.

Played a lot in a short period of time, so not something I would buy for myself.

Heard it was similiar to Royal Palace.

*UPDATE*

Played a few more times. Would play again, but don't think I would buy it. With more plays, game loses it's charm.

Though I was happy to see Dixit win the SdJ for 2010, I was surprised that Fresco, which was nominated, didn't win.  This one's a solid worker placement game that encapsulates its theme wonderfully well.

Base Fresco is an extremely simple game.  I can see it being a good gateway game, but I find it boring compared to other gateway games.  The game mechanics are cool, but the actions are super simple and the rewards are near-constant, so the whole experience isn't that fulfilling.

Liked it, but did not love it. Works as well as any other decent euro-ish game, but felt a tad more fussy.

Having two screens to hide behind also felt a bit clunky.

RATING: 4.5
Frustrating worker placement game, a bit subject to analysis paralysis.  Frustration arises from so many variables outside player control.  Would benefit from better theme integration.  The part of the game which constitutes the actual restoration of the fresco is anticlimax -- a flip of a tile.  The game proves to be a game of mixing paints (or swapping cubes), not a game of fresco restoration.   In all, too much work and too little fun in a game that fails of its promise to excite players with fabulous art.  

IMHO, the game could be tremendously improved by expansion kits with tiles that could be inverted to display actual cathedral art.

Great game, the theme is awesome and fits the game very well.

The expansion is pretty hit-or-miss.  The glaziers is great and makes the game much more challenging and heavy.  I will definitely include it when playing with other gamers.  The gold expansion is okay.  Varying the market is nice but I don't feel like they change your decisions much.  You are already going to move the bishop towards your painting, and just use the gold tile if you can.  
The wishing well is awful and I don't see myself playing with it again.

The core mechanisms are solid. The expansions make the game better, though the added weight isn't quite worth it. I can understand why people like this game, and I wouldn't call it a bad game, but it isn't for me.

Additionally, some small things makes me want to play the game less: for example, mixing paint after painting (except on the last round) feels draggy.

I'm usually not one to care to much about taxonomy, but this here is not worker placement. It's simultaneous action selection using action points (we're not placing workers on limited public spaces so it's not worker placement) with a hidden programming element and a lovely decision trade-off for turn order. 

The game gets increasingly brain burny as it goes on but doesn't become overloaded. Rather, the decisions become increasingly agonizing, particularly which turn order spot to take and the corresponding prices for things and effect on your potential action points (you can get fewer or more depending on where your "mood" marker is). The decisions on which actions to take each turn -- which are programmed secretly then revealed -- make for lots of angst, and you will waste actions from time to time. There are times to hang back and secure first choice for turn order and there are times to go for broke and get the points before they're all gone. The decision space pulls you in enough directions that you never have a dull "auto-pilot" turn. And the game is reasonably thematic; you have to mix colors in order to get secondary and tertiary colored paints.

On the downside, the game is fairly basic and needs some expansions to add some dimensions to it. No problem there as they have up to 10 now, however, that means you need to make yourself a cheat sheet for how to integrate them and keep them all straight.

This game gets compared a lot with Pastiche because they came out very close to each other and they both provide the opportunity to mix colors to get other colors. I prefer Fresco over Pastiche because the former truly offers some interesting choices: when to get up largely determines the rest of the turn, and it seems to be a benefit to not choose the same wake-up time each turn. I have definitely not played this enough.

This was on my wishlist for so long and then I finally got to play it.

There is no way to catch back up to, or indeed really hinder a run-away leader.

The choose time to get up and adjust mood track was the part of the game that interested me the most but it fell completely flat.... there is no reason whatsoever that the first player would not automatically take 7:00 start as it doesn't really affect mood (-1) and the cost to purchase is cheap (2) Getting up earlier affects mood more and makes everything cost more.

There is no urgency for acquiring paints that would warrant paying so much more per tile, and the change of mood track is so long that in our game it was completely irrelevant, as nobody got near either the top (to gain an apprentice) or near the bottom (to lose an apprentice).

The action planning stage is a little strange as you have so many apprentices you can do all the actions.
Closing down a market stall costs you the action and therefore doesn't seem to work because, why would you send your guy there to close down the stall when he could just buy paint instead? Purchasing tiles simply fell to purchasing the tile with the most paints on irrelevant of colours as you could just mix them yourself anyway.

The fresco ceiling grid is small and so its difficult to stop a player gaining the bonus from the bishop being present on the tile when its painted and the victory points awarded seems like they were plucked out of the air randomly and so after 2-3 rounds a runaway leader had painted several 11 cost tiles and thus was so far ahead that we couldn't catch him and had no real way to slow him down.

The gain 3 money action was always a must as that covers the cost you just spend on paint that turn and so it wasn't a real choice about putting a guy there we all just did because you had to if you wanted to continue to play the game.

The improve mood action is really disappointing as it moves you 2 back up the track and thus negates the whole 'penalty' for getting up early.

The end of round gain money equal to the tile painted is a win more mechanic as you gain more money to buy more paint which means you paint more tiles which means you get more money.

Nothing really new or inspiring in this mediocre worker placement game.

Visually gorgeous, the board is well arranged, and the uncomplicated rules well written.  

Going first was a big advantage.  Mixing colors is important for the higher score.  Getting fresco tiles early for a steady income is very important.  

I am so impressed that the game comes with 3 modules that expand play.  I am hopeful they will improve play (play seems just a tad repetitive), and take the game to the next level.  However, I do enjoy the game as it is.

I love this game for so many reasons:
Lovely artwork and attractive theme.
If you mess up in the first round you can easily recover.
Some actions are carried out simultaneously so not too much waiting for other players.
Usually get close finish so everyone is in with a chance.
Turn order is determined by who is leading or losing. 
Once you've acquired paints and Thalers you can't lose them again, you just hide your resources behind your screen.  You can usually get the resources you want on each turn.

A friend described this as Colonia in less than half the time, and I think that's a pretty good description.  It's basically gather cubes each round, possibly convert them to something else, and then try to get victory points for fulfilling a specific combination.  Most of the game is hoping you get to use your resources in the most efficient manner possible before someone else does and you're left with a bunch of stuff you don't really need.  There's a couple of interesting elements, but I'm just not a fan of a "hope you don't waste too many resources" type of game.  Ultimately whether I'm interesting in playing this comes down to how fast the game plays with experience.  If it's under 45min then it should be acceptable. Bombay comes to mind for sort of targeting the same audience/time-frame, but being a lot more intriguing.  Apparently the only way to play is the advanced version, though, so I'll have to give this another shot.

The return of the true Euro - it looks complex but is remarkably simple game, yet with luck free strategic choices.  The colour mixing and planning aspects have great educational benefit.  But for gamers you must add at least one of the inbuilt expansions to give it needed bite

Règles traduire à l'arrache avec des paragraphes absents. Impossible de jouer sans aller chercher sur le net.

Des mécaniques arbitraires de partout.

De la programmation en aveugle (type Colt Express) mais sans le fun et avec de la frustration en plus.

Un équilibrage des tuiles / cartes aberrant.

Répétitif et pas si court.

De l'aléatoire aussi; il faudrait pas l'oublier l'aléatoire.

Un beau matos. Enfin plus grand que vraiment fait avec gout en fait. Car il y'a rien de joli / imaginatif.

Fresco is no role model in innovative game design, that's for sure. In fact, mechanically it is about as derivative as you can get with the minor exception of the morale track that rewards players for taking late turns and punishes those who always go first.

The aim is to gather resources (paints) and turn them into victory points as efficiently as possible. Somewhat unusually, this includes a very strong timing component. The closer you get to the end of the game the more important turn order becomes, and sometimes you will just want to hang back in order to get first dibs next turn.

Even though Fresco doesn't bring anything new or substantially different to the table, it presents a very polished medium weight experience with well-integrated mechanics and a convincing theme (even if painting a cathedral may not be the most exciting setting imaginable).

The inclusion of the three (tiny) so-called expansion modules in the box doesn't score the game any extra points. Outside of a family setting they are absolutely required and therefore to be considered part of the base game.

Fun worker placement game! I would say that it doesn't do anything really different from other games of its type, but everything is held together quite nicely and its a very tight and easy-to-work system, so I like it. I also like that the theme is not often used, so it adds to the freshness.  While this is a WP game, the idea of hiding your workers during placement is smart and is what makes this game feel different. I also like how players jockey for player position. All in all, a nice WP game for those who are in to those types of games (which I'm happy to say: I am!) If I have any one detracting point, it's that it can feel a little repetitive by the end as there is really not that much feeling of development in the game (even with the painting coming clearer as the game goes on!)

Typical Euro with nices bits and board. Some people may find it boring, but for those who like worker management games, I find Fresco much more interesting than the likes of Stone Age since there are more things to do and keep track of. I especially like how wake-up time affects many factors in the game, from the mood of your workers to pigment prices in the market.

Finally, a Euro that uses cubes in a way that makes sense thematically, and connects the players to the game. A very pleasant, non-combative game for gamers who don't wish to go at each other's throats- although there can be some screwage here. It must be played with the included expansions to make it more interesting- otherwise it gets a bit plain quickly.

Colorful and thematically rich resource management game that could aspire at taking the crown from Stone Age in the light-medium WP category. Simple mechanics but full of hard decisions: from choosing the wake-up time to deciding which places your apprentices will visit, from balancing money and resources this is one of the best worker placement games out there. For the mechanisms to work flawlessly the three expansion modules are mandatory!

People I play this game with seem to enjoy it. I have played it with all of the options, none of the options, some of the options and really still just feels like simple math to me. The first time I played it I thought "here is a perfectly good game that I feel no urge to own", because I have many other games that work in a similar fashion that I enjoy more. 

There is usually some joking about when people are getting up in the morning and how the players' employees feel about that, and I do enjoy that part.

If you can 'read' the simple math in this game, you'll crush your opponents while they inexplicable have a good time playing.

This seems like a very basic worker placement.  I played it once with a few rules wrong (we played that only the first person to the paint markets got any new paint.

I have been VERY pleased with Fresco. Finally a cube pusher that has a theme that makes me want to play. I think the addition of the 3 'expansion' modules add variety as well as alternative paths to victory. The wake up mechanic is very interesting and can be tense. 

2 things are holding my rating back:

1. Being in first place can be devestating. I find it frustrating that you WANT to stay behind and it is very easy to do so. There are incentives to paint frescos early, but I don't think the incentives are enough.

2. I think too much of the game relies on the last 1-2 turns. Everything comes down to player order (see complaint #1) and winners and losers are determined by who paints what frescos in which order. Early in the game you can compensate for someone paining 'your' fresco. There are plenty of others. Late in the game you can not. You are simply out 4-8 points. This can decide the winner.

I would like to see, with more plays, if these complaints intensify or wane. Maybe I will find ways to use these mechanics to my advantage. Maybe I just don't like them.

Fresco is a good and easy to learn strategy game where each player are painters and tries to restore the fresco of the cathedral.  The player with the most victory point will win.

I also like the blending paint mechanic.  It fit well with the theme of the game.

This may be where I discovered that, even though I like the type of game which has lots of different colors of cubes, I have trouble enjoying it unless the cubes are fundamentally different from one another. When blue and yellow play the same way except that sometimes you need one and sometimes you need the other, it's a harder sell for me. (Yes, using pink and brown introduces some asymmetry. I still didn't care about Fresco very much.)

I really enjoyed this cube-management, pseudo-worker-placement game. And I'm kinda disappointed that it did not win SDJ in 2010. 

It has a nice theme, which fits the mechanisms very well, and has interesting decisions. It's also not wholly worker placement, since you use simultaneous action selection and you can't really get blocked from performing the actions you chose.. with the possible exception of the market action. The turn order selection mechanism is very nice too... having to balance between performing actions early and paying more at the market and sacrificing worker morale.

I wasn't totally convinced by the rule regarding scoring, where, if you land on the same space as someone else, you choose to either go forward or backward by 1 point (which affects turn order picking order).. and it didn't help that I finished second solely as a result of this rule in the final scoring.

Overall.. an excellent family strategy game that should have won the SDJ award. I certainly look forward to playing it again and trying out some of the extra modules.

I was skeptical, as Queen is a "hit" or "miss" company for me. However, I was very pleasantly surprised, as the game contains lots of decisions and some nicely blended mechanisms. I played only with the advanced rules in both of my games, but can see that it is far superior than the basic game that many others played. The theme of painting the Sistine Chapel seems original, and the game has a "new" feel to it even though some of the mechanisms are retreads.

Another game about converting wooden cubes to victory points, but a pretty good one at that. You also combine cubes of different colors to make bigger and more valuable cubes, but the theme makes it quite intuitive and somewhat pleasant by describing it as mixing paints. However, the most distinctive feature is the clever mechanic of variable turn order that penalizes earlier players to compensate for their inherent advantages. The game allegedly comes with three expansion modules, but that is likely just a marketing scheme, as it appears the full game was stripped of several elements to make it more palatable to non-gamers.

By all means, jump into the full game with all expansions right away. The base game I likely wouldn't waste my time with. All in, it's nice and it moves at a good clip. 
As a note, I am sick and tired of rulebooks that refuse to consolidate themselves. In one day I played Through the Ages (with its stupid programmed instruction) and Fresco, the latter of which buries the 2-player rules in the expansion rules... and the expansion rules modify setup considerably... it was Dumb.

RATING: 6
Without the expansions, a rather prosaic game. With them, balancing what you want to do with what you are actually able to do is interesting and some tough choices. Everything stems from picking when to wake up, and sometimes I feel that that is the only really significant choice on some turns, but not most of them by any stretch. Doing each phase in turn order keeps everyone involved, no waiting through stretched out player turns. Definitely mid-light euro, plays in 60-90mins.

The theme and graphics are lovely, and everything ties in nicely - what you are doing generally makes sense given the theme. The sizing of the cubes proportional to value is a nice touch.

A fairly easy game to teach and play.  I like the worker/painter secret/simultaneous placement, as it speeds up the game and provides a good "feel" with the theme.

The paint mixing is a nice touch, and also goes to show that one can teach by playing a game!

Pretty standard Eurofare mechanically.  Very well developed, the game flows smoothly and easily.  The first turn downtime was horrifying, but it turned out each subsequent turn had less and less downtime until basically none at the end.  An interesting play arc, that way.  Pleasant game overall.  The fresco tiles are a little too swingy though, and it's extremely difficult to do much planning.

My favorite gateway to show the "Euro World" to my friends. The game is easy to teaching and learning. Some people will say that Fresco is too light, but I think that it's the idea. Even if you have never played an euro before you can easily win. I recommend play it with the expansions, without it the SO simple (more than it use to be). Moreover, it's a beautiful game.

Pick the play order. Send your worker to work, collect the point, or supplies for next turn.
The earlier you play the most expensive supplies are and the most likely you are to get a malus. Of course you can spend time to compensate.

Reasonable family game that can be scaled up/down in difficulty. At the top complexity it makes for a decent game even for proper gamers and at the lower end it's accessible for even young children.

The getting up mechanic is clever both thematically and also as a mechanism - plus as an added bonus it would make Megan laugh her head off!!

Good. I failed to be drawn into the theme, though, and interaction was a little random in my opinion. The good ideas (the time of going to the market affects your mood, for instance, and the intuitive mixing of colors) would have warranted a better rating, but I never had a feeling of painting anything. Still, Fresko is definitely worth giving it a try. That's my opinion after only one play (basic rules).

RATING: 7
This is a simple, straightforward game, that happens to be very immersive in theme. You are a master painter, trying to paint the ceiling of some church (think Sistine Chapel). However, actually you are in charge of five apprentice workers who do your bidding. The turn order is a novel and humorous mechanic of bidding for wake-up time. Wake up early, and you get first shot at the paint ingredients and painting the ceiling. However, you piss your apprentices off; piss them off too much, and one of them quits. On the other hand, if you wake up later, your apprentices are happier, and soon enough, an additional worker shows up, but you have poorer choice in paint and opportunities. The base game makes for an excellent gateway game, while I feel the expansions should satisfy veteran games (we have yet to get to these). Overall, an excellent game that pairs well with its sibling, Samarkand, from the same company, Queen Games.

Update (10/31/10): Finally played with the three expansions, which adds more variety and depth to gameplay. Accordingly, the points scored are substantial compared to the base game. There are new strategies to examine and play time is somewhat increased, satisfying those who want more meat in their games.

Update (01/14/12): It doesn't get played as much now, and it certainly had a shorter honeymoon than its sister Samarkand, which was bought at the same time. Some complain about the randomness of the market, but I think it is probably the repetitive nature of the game: waking up, going to the market, painting the cathedral ceiling, painting some portraits, mixing the paint, and relaxing at the theater. It's too much like real life, with a very narrow band of variety. I'm downing this to a '7' from an '8'.

An 8 from me so far, after a few plays. Its a solid, fun game, with great quality components. 
Its a very light worker placement game, with a nice twist on the way the first player is chosen. The components are high quality and the board design is very well chosen. 
Its a great family game, very easy to explain to kids.

A játékosoknak freskó darabokat kell festeni, ehhez a festéket a piacon vehetik meg, illetve a különleges színeket ki kell keverni. A vásárláshoz való pénzt a festéssel illetve portréfestéssel lehet szerezni. Ehhez 5 festősegédünket használjuk fel. Szórakoztató, ahogy a játékosok sorba eldöntik, mikor ébrednek fel a segédek. Aki korán kell, biztos piacra talál, egyértelmű, hogy mit tud megfesteni, jó portrék jutnak neki, viszont drágán tud vásárolni és rossz kedvűek lesznek a segédek. És ha túl rosszkedvűek, akkor csak négy segéddel tudunk dolgozni. Ha később kelünk, olcsóbban vásárolhatunk, jó kedvű segédeink még erősítést is kapnak, de se a vásárlás , se a festés nem biztos. 

Gyönyörű játék, szórakoztató játékmenet. Kezdő társasjátékosok is nyugodtan leülhetnek vele játszani. A játékhoz már eleve három kiegészítőt is hozzáraktak, emiatt az újrajátszhatósága is magas. Én eddig 17 játékot játszottam vele, de még messze nem unom. Nem olcsó játék, de szerintem megéri.

A fairly straightforward programmed action game themed around restoring a cathedral, all fairly opportunistic in nature. There's no real incentive to build income as money is easily acquired with a worker placement. The bishop's movement adds a bit of luck to proceedings and whatever you do don't let your mood slide into depression as (barring the use of certain portraits) there's no way back. This is the kind of light, attractively themed Euro that I would have snapped up just a few years ago. With bulging gaming shelves I can afford to be more choosy.

Fresco is a great introduction to eurogames, I feel, and it particularly appeals to nongamers (in my experience) because of the fun aspect of mixing paint. Overall, it combines a lot of the core aspects of euro games in a neat and tidy shell. The expansions add replayability, too.

Try it out with intelligent folks who aren't eurogamers, but are willing to learn the rules.

Los jugadores son maestros pintores que usan a sus aprendices para restaurar un fresco de una catedral renacentista. Se levantan a distintas horas del día (=eligen su orden de turno), algo que afecta a su humor(=productividad), y el precio de la pintura en el mercado (=lo que pagan por adquirir cubos de recursos).

Durante su turno, pueden comprar pinturas (=recursos), mezclarlas para obtener colores distintos(=recursos para adquirir losetas más valiosas), pintar el fresco (=conseguir PV´s), pintar retratos (=obtener dinero) o ir al teatro para mejorar su humor. Se pueden enviar hasta 5 de sus trabajadores, con un máximo de 3 por acción.

La mecánica principal es precisamente la colocación de trabajadores en su tablero personal, algo que es simultáneo y oculto a los demás y que, como se actúa en función del orden de turno seleccionado (= hora de levantarse dentro de la temática del juego), ocasiona que a veces hayas elegido alguna acción inútil para cuando te toca actuar o que sacrifiques demasiado para conseguir algo que necesitas.

Me gusta la idea de mezclar colores, porque es algo que le sitúa por encima de la típica mecánica de "tomar cubos de recursos para transformarlos en PV´s".

Otra idea brillante es la de seleccionar, en la medida de lo posible, el orden de turno. Levantarse temprano ocasiona que compras la pintura que más necesitas, pero más cara y empeora tu humor (pudiendo llegar a perder trabajadores por ello), levantarse más tarde hace que la pintura del mercado sea más barata, pero no hay tanto dónde elegir, aunque no se resiente tu humor.

Como vemos, combina colocación (oculta) de trabajadores + gestión de recursos + selección simultánea de acciones y además existe un elevado número de formas de conseguir PV´s: dedicarse a las pinturas baratas y convertirlas en PV´s gracias al altar, pintar frescos baratos para luego puntuar por monedas al acabar la partida, ir a por las partes del fresco más caras, mover convenientemente al obispo...

PROS: Tiempo del juego muy ajustado. Accesible para no jugones (basta con no incluir ninguna de las tres expansiones de la caja básica). Configurable, gracias a añadir una, dos o tres de sus expansiones.

CONS: Sin ninguna expansión es un juego muy soso para el jugón medio. El cuarto jugador suele elegir posiciones muy extremas para levantarse (muy tarde o muy temprano). Eurogame típico ejemplo de muevecubos sin alma. Jugando a 2 jugadores, se emplea un jugador ficticio y eso a mi no me gusta demasiado.

Very good worker placement. Uno es un pintor compitiendo por complacer al obispo que nos ha encargado la restauración de un fresco en el techo de la catedral. Como típico WP, cada jugador debe asignar trabajadores a realizar tareas en cada turno, pero compite por el orden de realización de esas tareas con los otros jugadores, y la calidad de las ganancias o los recursos podría depender de ese orden. La mecánica de selección de turnos es buenísima; cada día uno debe escoger la hora en que se va levantar para trabajar, lo que hace que el humor de tus aprendices fluctúe, pero los precios de las pinturas son mejores cuando te levantas mas temprano. Excelente!

7 for the rating;

pros:
nice theme supported by beautiful artwork; clear move order, easy to learn/teach, etc. etc. (all the obvious)

cons:
would have liked to like it more, but it didn't get me during my first play; maybe the winner-unclear-till-the-end-factor, the reverse mover order and so on contributing to not feeling like there's overly much to plan in the cause of the game, while in the end, timing can be quite important; the whole process of buying colours, mixing them in advance and painting the fresco leans towards analysis paralysis which i thought would be less strong in the game so the joyful occupation of restoring the colourful church ceiling sometimes becomes a tour-de-force for a few players

A gateway worker placement. Great theme and colorful components and wonderful art. Gameplay is also very smooth and the provision of the different modules allow for replayability and depth.

Bleh.  It was perfectly okay with nothing really outstanding.  I played the whole version, so there wasn't anything left.

It seemed to really come down to turn order, which is okay in some games, but there wasn't much to take that over here.  Mixing paints didn't do it for me.

The best part was planning out where to send my wee little workers.  That brought me some interesting choices, but nothing else really.

Just like the name of the game, Fresco is a game of paint Fresco in Renaissance. Players use various colors to paint and complete a mural masterpiece. For coloring, players must proficiently labor their master painters and apprentices. To be a best and renowned contributor of Fresco, game participants have to skillfully carry out their plan. The game, Fresco, has very simple rules and clear game mechnics. This game is good for both boardgame beginners and even skilled gamers too.

Some of the guys in my group really like this but I thought it was just another boring worker placement game. Yes it has some interesting ways in which the workers are placed and the action order is determined, but at the end of the day you get cubes, convert cubes and turn them into victory points.

Does the theme work? Sure. Is it a theme I could potentially like? Definitely. But the mechanics just do nothing for me (like Vasco de Gama a couple of weeks ago) and I was bored on about turn 2 and we had to keep going through the exact same motions for another hour or so.

Booooooring...  Yet another game about converting cubes into other cubes.  No original ideas, no freshness.  The theme won't make up for it...

The only reason it doesn't get a lower rating from me is that mechanics works without problems and the game might be worthwhile for newbies who are not familiar with many eurogames.

Like some others my expectations were low and it did turn out better than I thought, it is similar to Leonardo except you have your own set of actions to pick from (its still worker placement, just done secretly ahead of time, your still fighting over the same things on the board) and all the works are all on the board and open info instead of coming out randomly so that seemed a little better.  

We played with the expansion and boy this game takes up serious table space, lots of micro managing bits too.  Lots of things to manage in your game too, turn order, colour conversion, works, cards, bonus points, etc.  Expansion seemed good added some ways to get points.  Had it come out a few years ago my rating would have been higher, sadly this is just more of the same nowadays, a good strategic game but nothing new and feels like other games in the genre.

Almost a perfect game! Everyone just loves the theme. The production is all up to the high Queen Games standard- thick cardboard, chunky bits, bright colors, a near-perfect rulebook, and my god... that awesome-looking box insert! Great!

The game is perfect as a gateway without adding in the three modules the base game includes. Very very simple to understand and play. The modules all add really good stuff. I would either play with all three of the modules or none, personally.

The modules:
Potraits- excellent! I love some player powers. It also adds a bit more intrigue to the portrait action.

New Paints- wonderful! weighing out whether or not you should go for these high scoring but difficult to get paint colors is a lot of fun.

Income...point...whatever tiles- These are ok. They give you a neat option toward the end of the game and encourage you to maybe take some tiles from the board you wouldn't normally do.

This game is just shy of a masterpiece for me. It would be a 10 if the two player game was a little less... blech.

I was disappointed with the game. The theme is awful and disconnected, it only makes sense when you have to combine colors to make another, still I hate to draw/paint, so the theme goes against the game (for me). The game is no fun, you always do the same thing over and over. Also it is very light for my taste. I don’t think I will play it again, if I’m going to play a WP game, I will play Agricola or Le Havre.

On the plus side the game is gorgeous, and it could be a great game to play with the family.

I finally played the game again and I now feel I was way too harsh with it. When I played it, I liked most games so I’m not sur why I disliked Fresco so much. I recently played the base game with all the modules it has and I have to recognize that even with the modules the game remains pretty light.

One of the modules introduces people that has some kind of ability. I purchased a very powerful one that allowed me to win the game easily, so I feel they are unbalanced. The other modules don´t add much complexity either, one I about more paints and the other about requests. 

The rules of the game are pretty easy to teach, you can do it under 8 minutes. 

The game´s decisions aren’t hard, but they are, somewhat, fun!

Bottom line, Fresco is a light game. I will sell the Bog Box Edition as soon as I can. I have to recognize that Fresco is a great family game, but it is way too light for my current tastes.

I intentionally avoided Fresco for a year after it came out, figuring it would be too light and not my type of game.

It is a streamlined cube-converter with interesting decisions at both the worker-allocation and turn order decision points.  For a 1-hour game I don't find it light at all, and that's a good thing for me.  (I think) it manages to avoid scriptedness and the tradeoffs between going early and late seem to be balanced.

Whether I have more than 5 plays of Fresco in me I can't say, but I'm confident that I do have 5 given enough opportunity, which is a pleasant surprise.

RATING: 5
As a wargamer at heart I have (in jest) dismissed the generic German cube shuffler as 'buy red cubes to combine with yellow cubes to generate orange cubes to buy victory points - most efficient cube shuffling wins'.

I thought I was being ironic; little did I know I was actually decribing Fresco to a T. I could also have added that there's little point in trying to do too well before the last couple of turns as there's a catch up mechanism that favours players at the back of the pack, and that ideally the theme will be completely irrelevant as it's essentially a mathematical efficiency exercise.

To be fair it's by no means a bad example of the breed and is certainly very pretty, but there's nothing new here at all.

Just have one play with four but we all had a good time with it. Fresco was easy to pick up, full of theme and had great components.  The only thing I'm questioning is the replay ability...My gut tells me there's enough variance to prevent this one from becoming stale anytime soon.

RATING: 8.5
- This game rates very highly for me, mainly because of its versatility.
- The game looks great, but more importantly the theme has been excellently implemented to the point where everything makes sense. This makes playing the game somewhat intuitive and teaching a breeze.
- Although it's a gateway game, there's enough strategy for gamers, especially with some of the expansion modules, to make it fun for gamers+rookies alike without it getting over-complicated.
- The turn order (waking up) and satisfaction mechanic is great. 
- I wish it played 5 so I could get it to the table more, but it's great with all player counts.

The components are really well done, immediately drawing in the wife and both girls.  The rules were very simple and straightforward.  They picked up on them and we were off.  While the interaction is subtle, you can't underestimate the importance of wake-up order.  If you're going to be last to wake-up then your paint selection is horrible.  If you want to wake-up early for best paint selection then you're gonna pay for it.  A family game?  Yes, but there is planning required to do well.

I'm not exactly sure why this game is described as "worker placement". I feel that the WP mechanic is rooted in the idea of simultaneously selecting an action and preventing an opponent from selecting it. It's true that Fresco has "apprentices" that you place on actions, but they are your own menu of actions, not a shared pool of actions. It feels more like the workers are action points and all actions cost 1 point. I don't get it.

Oh, the game? It's not really compelling, but it's a tightly enough designed set-collecting game to be enjoyed by a light-medium audience. Actually the most interesting aspect of the game is how they market the "full" vs. the "basic" game. The 3 "included expansions" together basically comprise the full game and are not really expansions at all. The game board is already designed to accommodate them for cryin' out loud. It's the basic game where sections of the board are put to no apparent purpose other than holding cubes. It will be interesting to see if other games follow this approach to scaling rule sets for different audiences.

RATING: 8
Lots of beautiful pieces. The game itself requires a lot of thinking ahead, but is pretty simple (so for those who are intimidated by "large" games, no worries). Easy to learn, and easy for others to get the hang of it. It can often get fuddly at times what with all the turning in of coins for colors and colors for other colors. Also, analysis paralysis sets in. But fun nonetheless.

A solid WP game.  Cleverly themed and quality made for a good gaming experience.  The mixing of paint colors and clearing of the Fresco on the board over time are strong points for visually and spatially focused gamers. The lack of randomness is also a significant plus in my book.  In particular, the strategic dynamic of taking an active role in choosing the turn order is a great addition to this game that makes it unique and enjoyable.  Fair warning: Due to the amount of phases and choices involved, it can move a bit slowly for heavy strategists like myself.

From my fine arts phase.   lol

I'm a bit of a sucker for games with an unusual theme, so I was attracted to both this and Opera due to the themes.

This is a quick and easy game to play. While fairly different it reminds me of Stone Age. I think with a few more plays this could become one of my favourite games.

Lovely two sided board and very nice components make this a very attarctive game to look at. Comes with three ready made expansions. I think the portrait expansion is easily the best of the three and should be played as part of the base game.

Interesting two step working placement. I like the scoring turn order versus get up time with mood swings. Lots of head scratching stuff going on. Near the end, there is a bit of AP as players try to maximize final points with dwindling opportunities.

My brain has trouble switching from color mixing to risk analysis. Left brain versus right brain! ;)

Don't like the two player rules. Too fiddly with the 'dummy' player. 3 or 4 player ONLY!

RATING: 7
Fresco, the latest totally-not-worker-placement-but-when-has-that-stopped-anyone-before game, puts players in charge of a crew of artisans working to restore a Renaissance fresco in the dome of a cathedral. Each interlocking piece is easy to understand on its own though not particularly novel; however the overall design ticks like a swiss watch and the integration of theme puts much of the competition to shame.

At the start of the game, tiles showing different combinations of paints are randomly distributed in the center of the board, completely covering the un-restored fresco. The goal is simple: purchase paints, mix the appropriate colors, and claim the matching tiles, revealing a fresh, vibrant fresco piece by piece. To outshine the rival artisans, players must carefully manage their actions, resources, morale, timing, cash, income, and turn order, the last of which is especially crucial. A turn begins with players choosing when to begin their workday (5:00-9:00AM). Early birds are heavily rewarded: first crack at the paints available for sale, first choice of tiles to restore, first choice of portraits to complete (for which they will be paid cash and given special privileges), and first crack at accepting special requests from the Bishop (augmenting income). Being first is hugely advantageous in Fresco, but starting the workday at 5:00AM will not go over well with the artisans for very long, eventually costing the player an entire action as productivity sinks among the dreary mood. Indeed, players content to begin their day at 9:00AM may gain a bonus action from high morale, but the best use of the actions will go to their task-master competitors. Turn-order in Fresco strongly recalls Power Grid, as players may hang back to score big, which then places them at the back of the line.

My expectations for this were low (see figure 2 above), but I have to say that this design comes out swinging. Attention to theme is extraordinarily high, if not without fault. The mechanics mesh well and hint at a master's touch. Players are rewarded with a slight edge in income for restoring low-value, base-paint portions of the Fresco. The game encourages a degree of specialization via the Bishop's requests, which players can only access by using some paints more heavily than others. Paints themselves are not quite symmetrical in value. Players who sync up their restoration plans with the bishop's inspections will attain a slight bonus to their scores. High replayability stems from multiple sources: random initial setup, randomized distribution/availability of paints every round, semi-random requests for portraits, etc.

After two plays I can say that Fresco has a lot of heart. I don't think it has much staying power, but it's charming enough that I'd happily play now again.

After only 1 play I think it's safe to say I will like this game.  While not the deepest Euro out there, it still had good elements of tension, not to mention that the board is gorgeous.

It's easy to foresee my rating go up with more plays

Update: Played again, this time without any of the modules.  I think my opinion of this game is somewhat contingent on the circumstances.  My wife and I played with another couple and its hard to think of a better game.  It's light, simple, and I would even say casual.  The game made conversation easy and we all had a lot of fun.  However, if I were to play the base game with my more apt game buddies and I think I would be wondering why I wasn’t playing something else.  With the modules added I think this is better, and this game will serve as a great intro into worker placement games and intro into gaming in general.

I'm a bit surprised that Fresko got such a good reception. No doubt it's a decent game but I'm not convinced that the decisions matter as much as they are supposed to. Even the one player in our game that made suboptimal decisions most of the time somehow ended up close to us in the end. All of this points to a game of infinitesimally more efficient resource procurement and usage being the key, at least in the base game I played. The JASE syndrome aka known as the curse of being late to the party? Or is there more than meets the eye and the rating rises with more plays / expansion plays?

It's a pretty good worker placement game, but it's also a lot like other worker placement games, except you're that slave driver Titian instead of some anonymous noble who's trying to build a medieval city.

Maybe I'm jaded, but as smooth and well-done as this game is, it's didn't grab me, either. You know you're bored with this kind of game when the most interesting thing about it is that when you land on someone else's space on the victory track, you get to choose to move one space ahead or one space behind them.

I've just gotten to a point where I question whether games like this need to be made. You know, the Caylus-Pillars of the Earth-Notre Dame family of worker placement games. The theme is mostly represented by the need to combine primary colors. Who cares?

A good after gateway game.  Not quite easy enough to spring on new gamers as a first game but a great follow up.  The game is quick to set up and tear down.  Rules are easy to explain.  Game play is fast with little downtime.  Player interaction comes from taking resources/turn order slots before other players, but not really any screwage.

Only played the basic game. This game is probably closer to an 8, but only having played it once I am reserving judgment. I absolutely love the time mechanic and the way in which score dictates turn position, akin to Power Grid. Having to choose whether to take more points or less points than an opponent makes for an extra layer of strategy and makes for a heavier game in a light frame. Managing happiness adds even more to the excitement. So many great game mechanics. I wish some of the blockbuster titles out there would have borrowed more from this game as they would be even better. Want to play more and hope I do. Not sure if the advanced game adds more to the game, or just adds useless features.

Second play was without the extra expansions (4,5,6... still played with 1,2,3).  Much better without the expansions, game flows a lot faster and still has roughly the same number of decision points per hour.

Money seems to be broken, as in it gives waaaay too many points at the end of the game.  You should be punished for collecting too much money, not rewarded.

RATING: 6
Very fun "family" game with great components and includes 3 expansions that can be added to add some depth to the game play.  After one play without the expansions, I now play with all of them and I think it certainly adds to the enjoyment. The wake-up time mechanic adds a nice element for impacting mood and cost of paints in the market as well as having a big impact on turn order during each round. After a few plays, the game time is relatively quick. It becomes important to pay attention to what other players are getting in the workshop and what request tiles they are going for so you can plan accordingly. The bishops bonus along with the cards in the portrait gallery can all add up to a lot of additional points over the course of the game. I have played it several times with 3 and 4 and both have been fun. The variable set up (with the expansions) should help with replayability and the modular expansions will allow most groups to step up the level of depth to their liking. Overall, a recommended game for its weight.

This game was thoroughly enjoyable.  The turn order mechanic of get-up-time is great.  Get up really early, pay the most for paints and apprentice morale goes down.  Get up late, paints are cheap, not much selection, but morale goes up.  Tough balancing.  I also like that the painting concept uses the colors the way they work in real life with the primaries (red, yellow and blue) being used to make secondary colors of purple, orange and green.  There is a nice tension in trying to get the paints you need in the market and then to complete parts of the Fresco that you have paints for before your opponent does.  Money has to be managed wisely as well as planning your mixing of blended paints (orange, green and purple). Mixing blended paints occurs at the end of the day for the following day , so you have to think ahead a little.  Looking at the expansions, I think that all of them will add an new dimension to the game.  Really excited to teach this to other people.

A very light Worker Placement game that is my favorite.   The 2 player version was a nice addon.  But the game thrives as a 4 player game.

Basic game is great.   But the expansions really add some meat to the game. Even "beginner" gamers and non gamers state they like the 1st module with the larger paint scores as the default part of the game. 

Fresco gets many requests to play from the non gamer peeps.

This is still an odd favorite of mine so it stays higher than the average.  Also Viticulture pretty much got famous off this game's mechanic.

Almost a "good" (7) game. It has nice unique taste for the player order system and for mixing different kind of colors BUT it's a little bit dull and dry experience. And long.

If you get it, get the Fresco Big Box release late 2014

In Fresco, players are master painters, working to restore a fresco in a Renaissance church.

Each round begins with players deciding what time they would like to wake up for the day. The earlier you wake up, the earlier you will be in turn order, and the better options you will be guaranteed to have. Wake up early too often, however, and your apprentices will become unhappy and stop working as efficiently. They would much rather sleep in.

On the lighter side of stuff I usually play, Fresco is a good stepping stone to richer stuff.  There are "3 optional rules/expansions" in the base box, but honestly the game is very shallow without them (maybe to play with kids).  Gameplay is a fairly generic mash-up of common mechanics, making the game a little bland even though it's very well produced and highly playable.

A nice little euro, reminiscent of other titles but still interesting. Reminds me most of Royal Palace in that you will be "buying" tiles off of a main board shared by the table. However, I much prefer the elegant system that enables those purchases in Fresco to the clunky sub-game of Royal Palace. The components, look and feel when playing Fresco is definitely top-tier, as well. Personally, I am tired of buying the latest flavor of the month in games, but I still enjoy this one when it hits the table.

It's an interesting worker-placement (mostly) game where your choice of waking up time decides the player order for the turn but also the price of paints, presenting an obvious trade off. Paints can be mixed (which costs actions) to paint higher-scoring tiles.

Although it was overall enjoyable for the first few games, I find that I'm not that keen to play it often. The choices it offers were interesting for a few games but after that it felt a bit repetitive for us.

Fairly standard Euro with one pretty neat idea: hidden worker placement. It's odd, though, in that when you start your workday seems to determine a lot of what happens, and you often don't get much of a chance to decide that for yourself (especially in a 3-player game). Not bad, but nothing to write home about. Plus we all know how I feel about [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/19991/for-someone-who-doesnt-believe-in-god-i-sure-do-bu]Cathedrals[/url].

Chegou dia 19 de fevereiro de 2011, sábado. Estreamos no mesmo dia. O jogo é muito bom, e os componentes, em especial o tabuleiro, muito bonitos. Dá gosto de jogar. O tema de pintores renascentistas reformando a pintura de uma catedral é bem interessante, e acaba facilitando na hora de explicar as regras. Bem divertido.

Opinião da esposa: O jogo é realmente muito coerente, como poucos. Muitas vezes, parece que a temática pode ser substituível em diversos jogos; não é o caso de Fresco.

Each play gets better. More players make the game better (I cannot recommend with two players). More modules make the game better (we have only tried the special blends).

I think the bishop's request module will provide that extra choice that makes each decision excruciating.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although a cube shuffling game at heart, it's cleverly hidden behind the theme of restoring a cathedral fresco by buying, mixing, and using paints. In this case, the cube format works well---a yellow cube stands for yellow! Red is red and blue is blue, and so forth. You don't have to pretend that a cube is some arbitrary resource, and when you mix them together, they behave as you would expect by generating new colors.

Beyond the typical cube shuffling, the wake-up mechanism in Fresco is neat. It's nice that you now have control over your turn---is it better to go first in turn order or try to increase your mood to gain an extra worker? However, the wake-up mechanism only really works if you play with all of the modules. Without the bonuses provided by the Portraits or the Bishop's Requests, there is almost no strong reason to wake up early and suffer a bad mood. You need to have some incentive to wake up early to make that initial decision more tense, otherwise you end up settling with a predictable pattern of wake up times over and over again. Another aspect that we found missing was that there wasn't really any tactical play around which tiles to restore on the fresco. Not only that, I wish there was a little more control over the movement of the bishop, rather than having him just appear at each finished tile (we found that the "private jet" portrait that lets you fly the bishop anywhere to be very powerful). I have high hopes for some of the other expansions such as the Scrolls or Glaziers that provide players with incentive to restore different portions of the fresco. 

We enjoyed it with three players and the simultaneous worker placement made for little downtime. People have compared two-player [thing=66188][/thing] with two-player [thing=6249][/thing] due to the dummy player, but we found it pretty different. The Dirk dummy player in [thing=6249][/thing] isn't really a player---it's more of a tile dump that you can use to change the positioning of your opponent. The Leonardo dummy player in [thing=66188][/thing] is more like a real player taking real actions, and it's a little clunky to pass him back and forth. Moreover, Leonardo is fairly aggressive---since he doesn't actually accumulate resources, his only purpose is to shut down paint stalls, steal portraits, or generally grab other items from your opponent. We were okay with it, but I can see how some couples who prefer non-aggressive play would dislike this. In [thing=6249][/thing], you still have to at least use your own resources to buy a tile for Dirk. There's always some opportunity cost to balance aggressive, blocking play, whereas in [thing=66188][/thing], the sole pupose of Leonardo is blocking. We'll probably keep it in our rotation, but it does feel better with more.

It's way better with the expansion modules.  But somehow, I just can't get excited about a painting game, even despite being a liberal-artsy cultural history buff.  I guess it just feels a little too much like another worker placement game, where you're converting X into Y and then into Z.  The components are nice enough.

Excellent resource management game where you are trying to paint the ceiling of a chapel.  You first wake up to determine your turn order.  Then you acquire paints at the market.  You then go on to placing your workers behind a screen to determine what you will do that turn.  You can mix paints, paint the chapel, acquire cards to provide benefits, etc.  There are several expansions that add a lot of replayability to the game.  Light to medium weight Euro that is a good "next step" game.

10/2012 What makes it a nice game - literaly - is the fact the one gets penaliced for leading the game.  Each round the currently last player goes first which is an advantage.  So, one should stay behind the bunch and make a leap in the last round, but then it might not be many victory points left to collect.  Looking forward to playing some of the variants.

Das Leben eines Freskenmalers in der Renaissance ist nicht einfach. Da ist einerseits der Bischof, der unbedingt sein Fresko und seinen Altar renoviert bekommen möchte, der aber andererseits die Arbeit erst bezahlt, wenn man sie geleistet hat. Und wie soll man sich die teuren Farben leisten, die man dafür benötigt. 
Zum Glück hat jeder noch einige Gehilfen zur Verfügung, die auf dem Markt Grundfarben einkaufen, diese dann zu den benötigten Farben zusammenmischen und das Fresko renovieren. Dabei gilt: Je früher man aufsteht, desto größer sind auch auf dem Markt die Chancen, die passenden Farben zu finden, wobei leider morgens noch echte Wucherpreise zu bezahlen sind. Und wie das so ist mit dem frühen Aufstehen ... Man hat den ganzen Tag schlechte Laune und wenn man die zu sehr an seinen Gehilfen auslässt, machen die sich aus dem Staub. Da hilft nur, abends die Laune bei einem Theaterbesuch wieder aufzupäppeln. Wenn dann da nur nicht wieder das frühe Aufstehen wäre ...

Eenvoudige worker placement waar we meteen kozen om met de uitbreiding (uit de standaarddoos) te spelen. Met 2 is het leuk, maar nooit waaw gevoel. Ook achteraf gezien dat er een fout in de handleiding staat, je krijgt geen 3 extra geld na een portretkaart. Met 4 is het beduidend leuker. Degelijk!

This game improves as we play it more. The game is much better than Carcassonne or Alhambra as a gateway game. There is enough strategy and meat here to keep serious gamers on their toes. We are currently working our way through the expansions, and unlike Alhambra, each module we add makes the game more interesting and better.

good, fun, simple enough to learn quickly but hard enough to be a challenge.
The moduals which I think are standard are a great addition.
Glad to see a game about painting and colors looks good too.  Though the player screens could have been nicer. 

What I don't get is how to get around the complete failure that one suffers if they go in the lead too early.  Does everyone just need to know to hold off painting as long as they can?

Another in a long list of Euros that would have been overwhelmingly good in 1999, but feel a bit by-the-numbers in 2011. Nevertheless, this is an example that is very well done, introduces a dollop of originality with the tension of buying early vs. buying cheap and has a stable of little expansions right within the package, something I always love. On the whole, very recommended unless you already own as many Euros of its weight as I do.

Definitely not a bad worker placement game.  What does it bring to the table?  Selecting what time you'll wake up (turn order) and how that affects your mood is fun.  get too crabby from waking up too early and people stop wanting to work with you (lose workers).  Go see a play at the theater to lighten up, wake up late a couple of mornings, and suddenly your cheerful enough to get more people wanting to work for you.  I also like that you're selecting all of your placements in secret.  None of this, "well you went there, so I guess I'll change my plan and go here."... No, you're going to commit to all the spots you'll go for the round.  Quite agonizing and fun!  I only wish it played down to 2 players without some sort of "dummy" player mechanic.

Fresco earns points for me as a worker placement game with a friendly theme. It also has a well designed and interesting mechanic of simultaneous worker placement. Some game design choices seem arbitrary, but I guess it makes for a better game. The resource management also fits the theme, which I like. Mandatory with at leastone expansion module.

Being an artist at heart, I love the idea of the paint mixing with the colored cubes. There are a lot of things going on in this game but they all come together to "paint" a solid picture of a team of artists working together to accomplish a goal. The expansions work great in this game and really give you a lot of different ways to tackle your objectives.

Love it.

Fresco is a gorgeous game with some nifty elements to it, particularly the wake-up and mood tracks. It was easy to learn, fun to play, and my first game resulted in a very tight final score grouping -- just two points between first and second, and another two between second and third.

The screens are a fun addition, and the constant tug-of-war between wanting to go first and not wanting to lose mood or pay through the nose for things was enjoyable. This interplay made for some tough decisions, and I often made a choice and realized a few moments later that it had been the wrong one.

Probably bears another play to really get a good feel for it; this could turn into an 8. As it is, I wasn't blown away but I had fun and would happily play it again.

Fresco is a worker placement game.  In it players are renown Renaissance-era master painters, working on completing the ceiling fresco of a great cathedral.

Each round is a day.  First you will decide when you will wake up.  The time you wake up determines turn order.  The earlier you get up, the more choices you'll have, but you will make your apprentices unhappy, and they may leave you.  Sleeping in will make your apprentices happy, but you take your turn later, and will have fewer choices available.  Your apprentices are the workers that you place out on the board.  You can send them off to market to purchase paints, or to mix the paints you have to make other colours, or to do side jobs to make you money, or even to the theatre to improve moral.  Then if you have the proper colours you will paint sections of the fresco.  This will get you points, and whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.

I enjoy Fresco quite a lot!  Part of what makes this a fairly unique worker placement is the implementation of a little used mechanic.  It's where players all choose what their workers are going to do at the same time.  Other aspects make it an enjoyable experience too.  Things like getting various paints, represented by coloured cubes, and mixing them to get more exotic paints.  The board is also beautiful.  Watching the fresco come to life, through the removal of tiles to reveal it as it gets "painted", is somehow fascinating.

If you're only going to get one worker placement game, this very well might be the one.  If you like worker placement games in general, then you should surely have Fresco in your collection.  I highly recommend it.

Have only played twice (once 2-player and once 4-player).  The 2-player variant isn't bad at all.  But, it is still a more interesting game with 4.  I enjoyed it with 2, but I have some other games that I'd rather play if there are only 2 of us (Egizia, Letters from Whitechapel, Agricola, Yggdrasil, etc.)

I really enjoy the ebb and flow of the game.  It is very distinct in a 2-player game due to Leonardo, but it is more interesting in a 4-player game (probably because it's less obvious)...

01/05/13 Played a three-player game in two hours. We used the expansion that added brown and fuchsia paints. 
My impression of Fresco grew as I played. Initially when I heard we'd be mixing paints (ex. blue + yellow = green) I thought, "What? Am I in third grade?" But I soon found out there was more to the game than that. It has a unique theme that pretty much fits the mechanics. The illogic of you painting tiles and *then* mix paints was the game's way of making you wait a turn to use that mixed paint; an additional turn where someone else might "get thar furstest with the mostest." That added some tension; so you had to keep an eye on what colors the other players were mixing. (A memory element as players kept their paints and money behind a screen.) Where I had assumed a game that wouldn't work my brain, I found it often to be a brain burner with occasional analysis paralysis. The rules were not complex but the planning stage could give you fits as you tried to have not only a plan A, but a plan B & C in case you were thwarted getting the paints you wanted. Direct interaction is low. Most player interaction is trying to guess the other's plans and grab the resources they want first. I was pleasantly surprised one player, who is colorblind, did *not* have a problem with this game that was all about recognizing colors. I've played several other "collect these color cubes and turn them in for VPs" type games, but this is one of the better ones. One reason, this one made sense theme-wise. Yes, you really do need blue and red paint if you want to use purple. I rated it a "7". That might go up or down as I see what the other expansions (portraits and bishop's request) in the box do in future games.   
03/12/13 Played a three-player game in 1.3 hours. We used the Special Blends expansion module. 05/07/13 Played a three-player game in 1.3 hours. We used the Special Blends and Portraits expansion modules. 02/25/14 Played a three-player game in 1.75 hours. We used the Special Blends and Portraits expansion modules. 06/14/14 Played a three-player game in 1.6 hours.

I feel this was a well-made game that would improve with more plays.  It seemed a little simplistic in my first play, although the decisions were weighty and the gameplay was intense throughout.  I'm just not that much of a fan of the "grab and score" mechanic (collecting goods only to immediately convert them into victory points).  I like more options (should I convert to money or VP? should I get VP through this method or a different one?), and I felt this game was somewhat lacking in them.  But it was an enjoyable experience nonetheless, and I'd be willing to play again, but it's unlikely that I would purchase it myself.

I particularly like Fresco as it seems to be very well balanced.  It is perhaps not a game suited to the hardcore Eurogamophile- I often see it described as "light".  

However, in the 20+ times I have played it, almost without exception the game has finished with each player scoring within less than a 10 point range, suggesting a broad range of suitable strategies, and also being quite a feelgood experience all round.

An interesting worker placement and resource gathering game since all players place their workers simultaneously on their action boards. Timing is very important and interaction is plentiful in this game.

We played the complete game with the "expansions" included. I would not recommend playing without them. Been a while since we played a really good worker placement and this was a lot of fun for us. Perfect for our group on many levels, including time length, intuitive easy to learn mechanics and rules (yellow and green make blue. wake up earliest get to go first, but things are more expensive). Although, there are enough things going on and tough decisions to make that it is it very complex underneath.

Another winner. The pieces are great for this and the worker placement is all quite fun and really works well with the theme.

A lot of the enjoyment seems to be in deciding when one will get up and either sufffering from an early start or laughing while enjoying life as a slugabed!

Well worth a try of you enjoy worker placement.

In Fresko verkörpern die Spieler Maler der Renaissance, die ein Kirchenfresko restaurieren sollen. Für diese Aufgabe benötigen die Maler natürlich Farbe, die auf dem Wochenmarkt gekauft werden muss. Doch die Grundfarben allein reichen nicht, denn die Farben muss ggf noch gemischt werden, um die richtigen Farbtöne für das Fresko zu bekommen. Hat man die passenden Farben, kann man die Arbeit an dem Fresko fortführen, oder im eigenen Studio Portraits malen, um an Geld zu kommen. All diese Aufgaben, übernehmen die Gehilfen des Malers, wodürch Fresko schon fast zu einem klassischen Worker-Placement Spiel wird. Dabei hat es aber genügend Eigenständigkeit und ein schönes Thema, um immer mal wieder gerne auf den Tisch zu kommen.

This is a very well balanced medium light game. The theme is strong and very fun. The components are gorgeous and vibrant. The rules make sense and it is easy to teach and learn.

This is actually a really solid little game. Maybe a little over-produced for what is essentially a game of churning cubes into points, but it is very appealing at least. I was actually expecting this game to be way too simple for my tastes, but this has quickly become a choice gateway game for me. There isn't anything all that innovative here, except for maybe how player order is done, though I had seen that already in Viticulture. In many ways, this feels like Lords of Waterdeep without all the chrome, which is something I can really appreciate.

As for the included expansions, the deck of helper cards are good to throw in. They don't change the game that drastically, and they give you an alternative to just taking money. The bonuses for having 3 types of Fresco tiles aren't that special, in my opinion. They're cool in theory, but don't really come into play very often unless you're playing with less players. The new paint colors, however, are practically essential. They add some extra steps to mixing colors, and this leads to more points. Good stuff.

Fine game with great components, and worthy to stand alongside Stone Age as an introductory worker placement choice.  Play it with the included "expansions" and you probably can't go far wrong in three or four players.

In 2 players, though, this has been bypassed in our collection by Stone Age and especially Dungeon Petz, both of which adapt more easily and without the use of a dummy player.  Certainly worth several tries, though.

Very fun game with an adorable theme and a lot of interesting choices. For some reason, though, the game somehow seems TOO balanced. Perhaps there is too much of a punishment to the person in the lead, but it almost seems advisable to not score too many points until the end, a mindset which kind of makes for a less fun experience... this is only a minor gripe though! It's also maybe a bit long for what it is. 

UPDATE: I figured out what it is. It's an overly scripted game, and the catch-up mechanisms are too potent. No point in trying to win until the last couple turns, because the game will balance it out for you anyway. (I'm exaggerating of course) Very cute theme and my friends like it, but I don't love the scripted nature of the experience.

Players are painters who are attempting to fresco the ceiling of a chapel. In player order, they must decide what time to get up (which affects their mood, market prices, and the number of apprentices they can have). They then secretly plot their actions using their apprentices (going to the market, going to the chapel, earning money, mixing paints, or improving their mood. Everyone then reveals, and take their actions. In the market, players can acquire paints In the chapel, players earn VPs by using selected paint combinations. Players can also earn $3 per apprentice taking the money action. Paints can be also mixed, with one apprentice allowing two mixes. Finally, apprentices can also be used to improve your mood. 

We played a key rule wrong, when we interpreted the rule to allow a person to visit more than one market, when during your turn, you are only allowed to viist one market stall. 

So I would like to try again since we have only played one game. The theme is cute, and the game plays decently.

What a lovely game.  The uncommon theme intrigues people, I have found.  Which is good because the base rule set is simple enough to understand that this works well with casual gamers.  The three included modules add just that extra bit of strategy to push this up to a medium weight game when playing with folk who are more familiar with table top games.

The way turns are determined can keep games close if players collaborate against a run away leader, slowing down their options.

I really enjoy this game.  It is not very tense, but it does have moments of focused figuring to make sure you can paint the portion you are hoping to.  Overall a pleasant experience.

Plus for some reason as we move from area to area of the round order my gaming group has developed a habit of saying, "To the cathedral!", or "To the studio!", while imagining a Terry Gilliamesque troupe of masters and their apprentices running together to the different areas of the board.  That never seems to get old.  It stems from someone pointing out that all these people do the same activity at the same time.

The very definition of a 5 rating. It works, but is completely devoid of all life and innovation. We described it as "Worker Placement 101" and I think that says it all.

To be fair, I have only played the basic game and would be more than happy to try it again with the added rules.

[b]Scoring: 3/5[/b]: "Every 2 thalers are worth 1 victory point" Kinda kills the scoring for me. Once you have a decent income and just spam the money action, it can honestly be a more legitimate way to get points than painting the mural, especially in a high player game where the bishop and tiles that you want are being taken from you on a regular basis. End game scoring is usually a pet peeve of mine when not done well, and while this game doesn't do it horribly, it just feels like money shoots people up way too far in this game.

A worker-placement game where each player is a painter trying to add sections to this great Fresco painting.  This game is a great introduction to the worker-placement genre, after determining player order (what time you get up) everyone secretly decides where to place his workers than reveal and do your actions.  Everyone understands colors, so the goals and ways to score points are easy enough to understand, and everyone can shoot for specific tiles to score.

I love worker placement games and this one is a great one to play for newer an introduction to the genre.  The expansions are necessary to add I believe and we only played with 3, might be more challenging with 4.

First impression (3 players): Pretty basic euro worker placement design but (perhaps because of this) I liked it. The most original thing was that players choose their order for the round at the beginning of the round but this is done in ascending score order so you also need to think about a little how many points you can afford to gain at certain critical times. player order not only says who begins but changes prices and may give/take extra worker. I liked and my rating might even go up after a few plays.

Rating for core game only. I didn't even want to bother with advanced rules after what I've seen. Why. Because this is the embodiment of all the things I dislike in games: It's yet another worker placement game with hardly any player interaction; you have wooden cubes type A, B, C... and convert them to type D and later to VPs and so on. There isn't anything innovative to that game, and the theme - oh let's not even start with that!

Although it has some nice features (you stand up at 5 a.m. - you're unpopular!), I really don't understand why this non-innovative game recently got awarded with the DSP. I will most likely never play that again.

[i]I still really like this game, and would be willing to play anytime but my family did not care for it.
We also have a lot of worker placement games and this one wasn't seeing any play time so it got traded.
I still maintain this is an excellent family game, but for us it fell victim to the Jones theory.[/i]

[i]- Theme: I am an artist and art teacher so I love the theme of painting a Fresco, especially the color mixing mechanic.
- As always beautiful production quality from Queen games.
- Love the happiness rating which goes up or down based on how early/late you get up.
- My family loves worker placement games (I know this is more a simultaneous action selection game but to my family it is WP).

This is another great family game put out by Queen games. (We also own and enjoy Escape: The Curse of the Temple and Via Appia.) My older daughter is 8 and she has no trouble playing this game well.[/i]

Beautiful game! The rule book, game board and components are all well designed and artistically integrated into a wonderful painting themed game. This game even comes complete with 3 expansions. We definitely play with all three of them and probably always will. The mixed colors and the reward tiles are so important to game play. 

A wonderful family game of strategy, with a great theme unlike any other! It's a little bit heavier than a medium weight weeknight type game, but still short enough and easy enough to play if you have a bit of time on your hands and are in the right mood!

So-so. Fairly high levels of chaos because of simultaneous secret planning (I don't like that aspect). It's mainly set collection, where you trade in sets of cubes for VP tiles, but you might not get the cubes you have planned for, or you do, but someone else buys that tile before you, meaning your sets are wrong. 

Difficult to plan ahead so is mainly tactical. Also there's hidden but trackable info, which I don't like, and think the game would be greatly improved if players could see what others were positioning themselves for, and plan around it.

I liked the mechanic where when you buy a tile you flip it over and keep it for income, and if you get a set of 3 similar ones you get bonus points and cube-income. This is the best part of the game. This made different tiles more valuable to different players, and it's tricky to get the 3rd in a set - you have to actively work at it rather than just sit back and see what cubes you get. 

The get-out-of-bed mechanic was peculiar as there is a trade off between several things. It does produce some weird results: the 4th player might be forced to choose between 2 very different times e.g. 1st or last, or they might have 2 adjacent slots that are identical except that one is a better version of the other. 

The last player has the least choice, but they are relieved from the responsibility of pressuring the next player(s). Similarly the first player has the most choice, but having to commit first means the other players can just flow around you. e.g. player 1 (the losing player) has to choose 5am if he wants to guarantee going first, but player 4 (the winning player) might be able to get up at 6am and still go first.

I'm not convinced the catch up mechanism does what it's supposed to.

Had fun playing this each time it has come to the table. Theme is very well realised.  I like that artists get grumpy if you make them to get up early! ;-)

Paint mixing is fun - cubes get bigger as you mix up the colours.

Components are decent, art is good.  Pretty easy to teach.

I'd jump right in and play with all the expansions though if you can, especially if you are playing with more experienced table top players.

EDIT: Deducted a point because of over-long play through with different group.

Great looking game that is fun to play.  For a light-medium worker placement, it plays quickly.  I prefer this to amyitis, which fresco feels similar to.  I do not think the mechanics are all that interesting, but the wake up time does give you some options, and theme feels cool.  I could easily see this going up (light, fun, theme) or down (somewhat uninteresting mechanics) with future plays.

A harmless Euro. The first choice each turn is turn order, based on reverse VP order. Going first increases the costs of getting cubes a la New England. Then once you know the order, you've got 5 guys to allocate to jobs (max 3 to any one job), the jobs being get cubes (they've been randomly put out in lots), use cubes to buy VP tiles (you need to correct colour combinations in cubes), swap two cubes in for a bigger brighter one (which are also needed for the VP tiles), grab money, or push up your dude on the whatever-it's-called track that'll get you an extra worker if you reach the top. Repeat until all the VP tiles are gone. The questions each turn are mainly where do I want to be on turn orders (trade off between cost and first choice) and what cubes will others take before me, therefore how many workers do I allocate to cubes. If it's risky, it may be better to allocate workers to the guaranteed jobs (eg get money) and hope to claim a higher turn order position next turn. So , do I play risky and potentially waste a worker, or not? And hope that other people leave you VP tiles you can make. There's not much more to it. It ends in about the right timeframe. Mostly harmless.

Nice worker placement game where players to collect paint to work on restoring a church. I like that players must choose what time of the day their workers are to wake up, which impacts their morale, choices at the paint market and the price of paint. The early bird gets the worm but then later on gets the bird from his disgruntled workers as they object to waking up early. Expansions allow for varied games and probably works best with all of them in it. Reasonable fun without the mess.

My favorite tile 'removement' game!  Just a well produced and good looking game.  Choosing your 'wake up' time each round makes things tense right from the beginning of each round.  And then I enjoy the hidden action selection/programming.  It's all about making the most efficient action selections, while being able to buy the paints that you need at the market!  Easy to understand and teach, just the right amount of choices to make each round, fun game to play!  The first 3 modules are also great!  I love playing with them!

I must say that I really enjoyed this game. First off, it is beautiful, probably one of the nicest games I have seen in some time. Also, the mechanics and the theme are great. You are making a painting and have to acquire paints and mix colors in order to paint parts of the mural. Fighting with others to get paints, mix them and then paint the part you want all with a limited amount of moves and while ensuring your mood is high. A must try for any Euro gamer.

Simple game to understand but contains some very tough decisions.  Deciding when to mix the more valuable colors is challenging.  This game has a theme that is definitely not pasted on; you almost feel like you are in an art class (in a good way).  In fact its been a while since Ive seen a game where the mechanics and the theme flow so well together.  The wake up time used to determine turn order and apprentices' mood works particularly well.  The set up and take down time is a bit of an obstacle.  It can take a good 10 minutes each for set up and take down, so good organization is a must.  The game play can be a tad fiddly, especially with a 2 player game where you each take turns managing the "dummy" player.  Reshuffling and redistributing the market tiles each turn is also a bit "fiddly".  But, regardless, the game works and it is quite a bit of fun.  The three included "expansions" will quickly become a  must.

Preso quasi solo per l'ottima veste grafica e l'alta qualità dei prodotti Queen Games, alla fine si è rivelato un buonissimo acquisto. 

A difficoltà regolabile (decidi il numero di espansioni in base alle persone con cui lo giochi), Fresco scorre come un fuso grazie a meccaniche semplici: carina l'idea della sveglia (che può rovinarti l'umore e allontanare i tuoi aiutanti) e ben pensata la scelta simultanea delle azioni dei tuoi uomini. La fase di restauro invece non è niente di originale (mi viene in mente Royal Palace, ma ce ne sono mille di giochi con questo meccanismo). 

Nota di merito alla scelta di produrre cubi colorati di diverse dimensioni a seconda della tipologia di colore (primario, secondario e, nell'espansione, terziario): grazie Queen Games, anche un daltonico può giocare!

Un Eurogame tradizionale che rivedrà il tavolo molto spesso.

I expected to like this game a little more than I did, but I got frustrated with the turn order mechanism.  Being able to choose your turn order is really cool... when it's possible.  Being in the lead early and always having the last choice really sucks though, especially when it means you're forced to wake up latest and go after everyone else.  I mean, I guess you could try to have more control by not getting points, but the idea of trying to lose in order to win doesn't really appeal to me.

Good game. I used to misinterpret the rules! You get to clean only ONE market. Either the one you bought paint from or the market you choose to clean out completely. This leaves other market sheds available to other players.

With two players there's a third dummy player that each player controls alternately. Works well.

The extra expansions are somewhat mandatory for advanced board gamers. The Portrait Cards and Bishop Orders give more options and add replay ability to the game.

Four player game takes rather long with non advanced gamers but was fun nevertheless.

One more 4-player - no expansion. Good game, but not enough to warrant a purchase. The catch-up mechanic is maybe not that though as I first thought.

***

One 4-player game - no expansion added.

Nice components and a well integrated theme. Your actions makes sense, thus the rules are easy to remember also for families.

Not really dry, but a bit of a calculating machine. Some of the actions are also put into the play in a somewhat "reversed" order (yeah, you would love to mix paint BEFORE going to the cathedral). It's about timing and planning your strategy for several rounds ahead.  

I have only one real major negative issue with this game: the freaking catch-up-mechanic. This is a really harsh one, much more dominant than that in Power Grid for example. In reality: once you get ahead, you have practically some "wasted" turns: it is no use place your workers on the market, since those players behind in points would get there earlier to buy it all. You'll just have to wait, get some money from the studios and sweat it out.. I don't like games where you for large parts of the game have no meaningful decisions to make. This should warrant a lower rating, but since this game does other things so well, I wait for more plays (maybe with a expansion as well).

This game is okay for me, however doesn't excite me.  I like the color acquisitions and the mixing aspects.  There seems to be more of a race aspect with the others.

an Ok game. Not terribly compelling but it isn't bad either. 

A good choice as a family game and gateway game. It just doesn't quite do it for me though. I guess the decision making isn't compelling enough for me. It seems to obvious what to do most of the time. Paths to victory seem limited and your options to achieving one of those few paths are also limited.

Ultimately I guess the fun factor just isn't there for me on this one. I feel ambivalent towards this game. I'm not going to ask people to play it, but if someone asked me to play I probably wouldn't turn them down either.

I wished this one would have been able to grab me more as I love the theme (being an artist myself)

Completely underwhelmed with the basic game... if you have any gaming experience at all, just start with all of the expansions, it's a much better game that way.

I really like the components and the mechanics -- both choosing what time to wake up (and therefore the mood of your painters and the prices of paints) and that your decisions are based on choosing and mixing paint colors. 

I'd put Fresco in the middle of my (many) worker placement/ resource management games... there are some I like better (Agricola, Caylus fan here) and some I dislike more (Stone Age I'm looking at you.)

The 2-player dummy "Leo" certainly is more work than "Dirk" in Alhambra. I didn't like how it plays and it felt fiddly. It feels the same as a 2-player 7 Wonders game. You have to take the dummy into account as part of your move and plan accordingly. Somehow this makes me feel both games are not elegant and clunky at the 2-player count. I will give this game a shot with 3+ players and see if it will be more fun. I suspect it will.

finally played this after a long wait.  lots of nice, Euro-y mechanics in a painting game.  my main point of comparison is Pastiche, which also features color-mixing, recipe completion, etc.  Fresco beats Pastiche on more involved mechanics (thought still easily accessible to any Euro-familiar audience).  But Pastiche has all those beautiful works of art, while Fresco, alas, does not.  Kinda strange for a game about art....

Fresco is a nice, pleasant game. Get paint cubes in the primary colors, mix them into secondary colors, then use those cubes - when the timing is right - to paint the fresco and score points. Added bonus-modules give more weight to your decisions.

Fresco's most striking feature is that all the player interaction is concentrated in one point (it's not really a worker placement but a simultaneous action selection game). On every area of the board it's first come, first serve, and the player to go first is the player to 'get up earliest in the morning'. Getting up early has its downsides, that you need to spend actions on to compensate. So early in turn order = less, but better actions, and later = more, but worse actions. The player with the least vp is the first to choose at what time to get up, so it might be wise to hoard cubes and not convert them to points yet... until the point where someone goes before you and takes all the high cube-to-vp conversion tiles.

It's probably a good idea to play with all the expansions (unless you play with people new to the hobby). Without them, it's too easy to wait around and pick whatever's left, instead of making the tough decisions what color to go for and when to convert to vp.

There are not that many avenues or strategies to explore, which is why I won't rate it higher than a 7, but on the flipside you can't really go wrong with any strategy, which makes it a great family game. Getting extra workers is good, having fewer isn't too bad, paying a lot for the good tiles or only a little for the bad ones, it can all work. Not too deep, but a satisfying game nonetheless.

Update: It's suprisingly fun, and the constant tension of the possibility of the other players taking exactly what you wanted just before you could take it, with the hidden simultaneous action selection, make it interactive enough for me. Yes, it's light, but that's not really a weakness. An 8, for now.

For me a classic JASE. The only thing I liked was that the rules for turning coloured cubes into other ones actually make thematic sense in this game.

What a great game.  Perfect theme and perfect mechanics to support theme.  the 'wake up' track and how that affects the happiness of your workers works well.  This is also an excellent family game but can also be quite competitive among gamers.  Also, i've had good luck introducing new gamers to this game...the game 'makes sense' to people and therefore, even though it might be a step up from a gateway game, you can still play it with non gamers.

A clever resource management action selection game I can see why it is popular. 

The turn order selection mechanism is great even picking last sometimes works toward your advantage. it coupled with the cube color mixing makes for a nice thematic element. The secret action selection makes gives you a lot of decision points and you have work around what you think you will get. Sometimes it is better to hang back and prepare other times go for broke. There are very few turns where you feel out of the running'\.

Lassan apránként haladtunk a kis kieg.kel, mert a kislányomnak is tetszett és neki viszont kellett a fokozatosság. A teljes alapjátékkal már nem is egyszerű, komoly(ka) kis játék alakult belőle. 
Izgalmas és összetett. Sikerült a 4-5-6 is beszerezni, és most már várom nagyon, hogy együtt mit alkot a játék. Emelem a pontot.

RATING: N/A
As Euros and Worker Placement games go, this one is not awful. The theme actually makes sense, especially where mixing paint colors is concerned. The Action Selection also makes sense, as you have the intuitive tradeoffs between waking up early (better choices of action but less pleased workers) vs waking up later (more limited action choices but increased worker happiness). It's a bit weird to cash in your green and red paints to uncover a part of the fresco that has neither green nor red on it, but no matter. The rulebook is clear and short, the included expansions can be added or removed to taste, and overall this is a pretty decent family-weight game. Nothing spectacular, but it's pleasant and clean and [i]works.[/i]

How this game could be considered to be awarded Spiel des Jahres is beyond me. The mechanics are recycled from a dozen other games and there is nothing unique, new, let alone interesting about them. Auction off turn order, secret action allocation and some area control and that's it. Another thing I do not like about this game is that wit and cleverness will not get you as far as analytical strategy, which is something that I don't want in my games. I want negotiation, assumptions, uncertainty, luck, randomness. Anyhow, Fresco is a mediocre (at best) euro.

Deceptively simple but can also be punishing. You pay dearly to maintain control and if you don't balance everything well you will not win. Sounds pretty serious for a highly rated family game but my family members are serious gamers and there is nothing casual going on here. We only played with all expansions included in the base game, wouldn't play without them going forward. Looking forward to trying out the next set of expansions down the road because they came along with the purchase. Love the theme and it is very well implemented. Great game so far.

The upside:
-Nice theme implementation for a euro. In this, the color of the cubes actually matter, and it's another layer of enjoyment on top of the normal "just...need more...cubes...".

Fun game that shares some features with Dungeon Lords but with a more boring and simultaneously more accessible theme. Could benefit from more variability.

This game got old fast. The strategy is limited. I prefer to play Lords of Waterdeep or Alien Frontiers for the light to Medium end worker placement games. This just doesn't do it for me at all. 
-6/25/12

This was the 2nd Action drafting game I learned after Dungeon Lords and since then I have learned that I am not a big fan of action drafting. I can enjoy it but its a hard sell. If I have to play a Action drafting game than I want to play Caylus. I hope to play Dungeon Lords and Dominant Species to see if I will like them over time but have played them very minimally at this point.

I love the theme. It's pretty unique as far as worker placement games go. But if Fresco only had a good theme, it wouldn't be more worthwhile than any of the other worker placement games that I already have and enjoy. The interesting twist that Fresco adds is the simultaneous action selection. So much of the tension in the majority of worker placement games comes from blocking people from taking the actions that they want. But in Fresco, players can place their workers where ever they want to determine  their actions.  

During a turn, a player can buy paint, paint at the church for VP, paint portraits for money, mix paints to make more colorful art and go to the theatre to feel happier. So a player can send as many of her five people to paint in the church as she would like (limit of three), but the tiles may or may not be available when it becomes her turn to decide which tile to paint. You assign all of your workers before learning where the other players have assigned all of their workers, so there is always a chance of placing a worker somewhere that it will be useless. It's a clever mechanic, and one that involves a decent amount of planning.

I have only played with the expansions and I am only interested in future plays with the expansions.  The expansions allow different players to each pursue a different overall strategy.  There is a lot less depth without them and the game becomes mostly cube pushing.  But the expansions come in the box, and it's a neat idea to have a number of different ways to play the game all in one box.

There's enough meaningful choices throughout Fresco to keep things interesting and the production values are excellent. Great game to look at. I wouldn't recommend playing without the modules as they add a lot of interesting choices to the game.

Fresco seems to fit into a wierd category of games.. It's very light for adults but pretty heavy for children. 

My biggest complaint may be that the game enforces too much balancing of scores between players. Lots of power in being first player, but player order is based on score. I would advise a variant where player bid for first player (players tend to have too much money anyway).

EDIT: After implementing a bidding variant I enjoy this game a lot more. Much less forgiving.

RATING: 7
A fine euro. Offers good trade-offs between turn order, prices, and number and choices of actions in each round. Not very directly competitive; the player interaction is in the form of competition for resources, turn order position, and scoring opportunities. Nicely thematic, and a very pretty production.

Wow, great game.  This was so 'old' my expectations were low.  But I love worker placement and the theme looked interesting enough to get this to the table with my kids.  We played for the first time the day after Christmas 2016 and had a great experience.

My eldest daughter really enjoyed the paint mixing aspect of the game (now I know Scoville's inspiration for their pepper mixing).  My youngest daughter enjoyed the 'choose what time to get up' mechanic (used successfully in Viticulture) and moving the bishop when visiting the cathedral.  I enjoyed the overall balance and flow of the game (and the cards in portrait studio were particularly awesome).

We picked up this game for $19 on Amazon and I'm very satisfied with the purchase.  I would recommend this game to all worker placement fans.

Worker placement, resource acquisition, tile collection for VPs, and cards (which act as helpers and add variability).

Very solid worker placement Euro game with a good integration of theme and mechanisms (mixing of paint). I like that you plan the actions of your workers (comparable to Dungeon Lords). Letting your workers sleep in or kick them out of bed early in the morning is an innovative turn order mechanism. 

With the different expansions it scales well from family to gamer's game and also the game length is a bit less than for most heavy Euros. The art work is also great.

I do not like that every game plays out rather the same without much differences. Furthermore the game does not evolve much during one session, since early turns play out rather similar to later turns. But in the end it is still a very solid game.

When I heard about the theme for this game (renaissance painters restoring paintings) I nearly fell asleep.  Turns out that this game is a bit of a gem - tightly bound theme and mechanics - always more things you really want to do than your than your available actions allow - no fluff.  All in all a great game.

Played basic game only.  this is an awesome euro type game.  the best thing is that although the theme doesn't quite shine through the mechanics, it does not feel like an abstract either so that is a big plus.  I like the out guess your opponent behind the screen similar to Revolution! But the resource management compared to when to pull the trigger on victory points is a great balance.  All the numbers with tiles seem to be really balance.  Can't wait to play with the full version...ie the three included "expansions".  Unbelievably this could be another 2010 release game to flirt with my top ten.  Just a great fun, engaging game. edit:  the three "expansions" included with this game just increase the options.  the game just feels more complete with them and really ramps up the strategy however, i love the tactical aspect of this game when picking times and when picking last.  just a great brain burner and surprisingly works awesome with two since the dummy player isn't just bookwork but has strategy ties to it when you are in control.

Fairly dull Euro-style game, clearly family-oriented and in my opinion the worse for it. There's nothing particularly wrong with the game, but I found, on my one play so far, absolutely nothing that was novel or of any interest. This has to be close to the most mediocre game I have ever played - utterly baffling (to me) that it is in the BGG top 200. (Note that we didn't use any of the expansion modules, which quite possibly will add more interest. But I'm I doubt they'll raise this game much above average.)

This is most definitely a gateway game, suitable for first timers, but there is not much beyond. The decision tree is simplistic and will not hold much the attention of the serious gamer... I don't feel throwing more money at it to find out if some of the expansions make it more worthwhile is appropriate in the overcrowded genre of worker placement, I'd rather pick up another (to play or buy).

Very fun, medium Euro with a very well-integrated theme.  The mixing of the colors gives it a real boost over other games where you collect resources and turn them into victory points (e.g. Stone Age), and the constant push-and-pull for turn order (wake-up time) is well-implemented.  It also scales very well in terms of the base game still being very fun to play with new players and then advancing to the expansions with experienced players is a blast (as opposed to say Agricola or Through the Ages, where the family/simple game are really just designed as training steps) - well, I guess that's why they're called expansions, but since they're included in the base I see them more comparable to family vs cards in Agricola.
This may get up to a 10 with more plays.

This is a fun game where each player takes the role of a 15 th century painter who restores part of a church Fresco for points.  the base game comes with three expansions included now. The game has some unique mechanics and all players choose actions at the same time, like mixing paints, purchasing basic paints or going to the theatre to increase your morale.

Pros: simultaneous play reduces down time.  Adjustable complexity.  Fun ,Strong theme and unique gameplay mechanisms at least when released.incredible components and beautiful artwork

"Amit ma megkeverhetsz, ne halaszd holnapra!" - ahogy nagyon találóan h-alga is megfogalmazta már :)
A játéktábla, a felhasznált anyagok nagyon impozánsak, kifejezetten szépre, hangulatosra sikeredtek.
A játék legnagyobb erőssége maga a témaválasztás, amely kicsit kizökkent minket a gazdaságis-építkezős euro tengerből. Hasonlóan sok más worker-placementhez itt is gyűjtögetnünk kell (ezúttal festékeket, pénzt), azonban a színek behozatala (ill. azok keverése) miatt még eggyel előrébb kell gondolkoznunk (ld.: fenti idézet). Kicsit elaprózhat, hogy rengeteg mindenre kell figyelnünk egyszerre, és ezért nem biztos, hogy az előre kigondolt dolgot tudjuk csinálni (pl. más előbb kipingálja a kinézett darabot). Igen jó ötlet a játékossorrenddel történő erőforrás menedzsment (ki korán kel standok garmadáján drága festékeket lel), ill. a kedélyállapot (színházlátogatás) függvénye alapján szerződtethető segédek száma is.
Nem kiemelkedő a társas, de igen szépen összerakott iparosmunka, ami a témája, és a viszonylagos könnyedebb volta miatt nyugodtan elővehető akár családi körben is.

You play a painter in the Renaissance Period. Your task is to send your apprentices to help restore the Fresco painting of the Cathedral. The game mechanics are very easy to grab, and it's a very good gateway game. By simply mixing up the colours one can easily calculate the finest way of action, which makes the game fast paced and light-weighted, not a bad thing for beginners. You can always at many modules to the basic game if you desire a heavier session.

Fresco: you use coins to buy colour cubes which you turned into cubes of another colour, and then in turn transform them into VPs. Yes, we've all been here before. 

You are juggling several resources (money, paints, worker satisfaction) and have limited actions (no. of workers) to get the stuff done for the VPs. You have hidden worker placement (behind a screen); though you can't quite block another player from taking an action, if you go earlier, you can make their action less useful for them. This means that going first is useful: but it costs a lot more to do so, and the player ahead in points has less choice about their place in the turn order anyway. So, full of typical Euro balancing mechanisms. 

All in all, it works very smoothly and the various working parts interact logically. I'm not going to object to playing this if tonight's game absolutely has to be a cube-pusher. However, there's nothing really here that you haven't seen before.

A well-realised example of the hidden action mechanic. Playable two players, and quite enjoyable, but truly a three or four player game.

The hidden actions do sometimses irritate me, but I guess that's what the game is - take it or leave it. It's a mechanic I don't really have at this level of game, so this has space in my collection, and will likely be played lots when I'm in the mood.

Like other Queens' Games games, the fact that the game is expanded in modules is interesting, but whilst the first expansion was great, the second adds only one - which seems to miss the point. I get that it was a former exclusive, but it still seems a bit cheap.

Very processional game that fails to spark or bring anything particularly special to the table. Nice and solid effort from Queen Games, just a bit dull, but okay for a family game if you aren't looking for anything taxing for the brain. Acquire coloured cubes. Trade these cubes in for victory points. Determine turn order based on furthest behind in points gets first choice of starting the round (but paying more), or going later (but paying less for maybe less of a choice). There's nothing innovative, but some people might be fine with that.

Everything fits together in this game in which players are restoring a fresco in a cathedral. By the way, what an original and wonderful theme.  I bought it just because of it, and on top of it the game turned out to be excelent.  [i]Fresco[/i] works like a clock, everything make sense in it, it is easy to learn and play, it has a deep gameplay, it is cuthroat and tensional, it has a quick flow of play...

The players are master artists utilizing their apprentices to restore a Fresco. Plays wake up at different times of the day, affecting their mood (read: productivity), the price of paint at the market, and the player order. There's a hidden worker allocation thing going on which is very nice, deciding between buying paint at the market which come in randomized sets, restoring a piece of the fresco or using excess paint on the altar, painting portraits for cash or "portrait cards" that grant specific benefits, mixing paints or fulfilling requests for completed sets of fresco sections, and improving your mood.

The simple game uses red, blue, and yellow basic colors, and also secondary colors (green, orange, and purple). You can sometimes get the secondary colors at the market, but more often you will have to mix paints to get the ones you need. The fresco tiles list the color requirements and VP award right on them. The advanced game adds tertiary colors brown and magenta, along with the portrait cards, and the request tiles for additional VP. The portraits add a lot to the game, and should be played with. The tertiary colors aren't too complicated to deal with and just add a little more depth and planning to fresco restoration. The request tiles are ok, I could play with or without them. If you're playing for the first time, listen to the basic rules first, and if it's not overwhelming, go right ahead and add the advanced components for a fuller Fresco experience. The game comes with cheat sheets that make it very clear how paint gets mixed, so don't let all this color talk scare you off.

Completed fresco sections give you income per turn, which you use to buy paints, which you use to paint more frescos. There are several paths to victory here, you could focus on getting cheap paint and dumping it for quick VP at the altar, or paint a lot of cheap frescos (especially plausible in the basic game) for a high income that translate to extra VP at game end. Or you could get up extra early to get the best paints and restore the best fresco sections. Or focus on doing portraits and getting portrait cards. I think you get the point.

I played this twice at Oasis of Fun and would gladly play it again.

A great worker placement game where you have simultaneous, hidden placement.  You pick a wake up time which affects your mood.  Purple is a very key paint so don't haphazardly get rid of your reds and blues like I did in my first play.  I also like the cool element of not having more than one person on the same scoring track spot and the expansions seem more like necessities rather than options, though they aren't overly complicated to implement.  Could go up with additional plays.

On a 2nd play we used all of the expansions. I liked the additional paint colors, but not sure what I think of the bishop's request.  They seem to make the game less tight.

Euro de colocación de trabajadores y gestión de recursos muy bien ambientado.

I will note here that I have only played with the three included expansions.  With those three expansions, the game is quite good.  I love the balance between obtaining goods, (possibly) converting them to other goods, and then converting those into points with obtaining needed money or benefits and maintaining a reasonable level of happiness.  Throughout the game, trade-offs have to be made, some of them painful.  The turn order mechanism is particularly requiring a balance of money, happines, and prominence all the while being affected by your total points.  You have incentive to wait to gain points, but if you wait too long someone can poach "your" points away.

In some ways, this reminds me of a somewhate less opaque Colonia (which I also enjoy) in that there are several steps needed in order to earn points but with a little less randomness involved.  01/26/2011

Update, 2-24-13:  Another play with 4, and I've decided that I love this game.  Moving into my top 10 favorite games.  It's a great combination of mechanics and theme, simple enough to explain to non-gamers in 10 minutes, and yet deep enough to be satisfying to any serious strategist.  A lovely design.

Update, 11-3-16:  Am I getting bored of Fresco?  My latest play was uninspiring.  I felt like I was moving cubes around to score points.  Sad to see my feelings towards this one change.  May be time for another medium-weight Euro in my collection (Islebound?).

Fresko -- 

Played once; three-player.  No expansions.

Very glad we played the most basic version, as it gave me an understanding of the game's elegance.  And now we're looking forward to building on that with some or all of the expansions.

Including the expansions with the base game (à la [thing=27173]Vikings[/thing]) was a wise decision.

Played our second game with all three expansions.  I think Expansion #3 (Special Blend Colors) slowed the game down by making it too calculational. All of the expansions were quite intuitive, but The Portraits and The Bishop's Request add interest without slowing things down. Also, I think the removal of the high-value tiles (from Special Blend Colors) will make the Bishop's Request tiles more accessible — thereby making it possible for players to more quickly build their game engines. I find that sort of progression engaging.

Played multiple times at all player counts. In its most basic form, Fresco is a simple, surprisingly thematic but rather mediocre game. The most interesting decision in the game is choosing the time to wake your workers up, as there are a lot of tradeoffs required to jump ahead in turn order. There is also some forward planning required in the purchasing and blending of paints, which is neat. But what holds the game down is the repetitiveness of actions and the general lack of an arc of progress.

Thankfully, the game comes with 3 expansion modules to increase the variety of gameplay elements, which is recommended once players have gone through the basic game once. More importantly, these modules help break up the repetitiveness by giving additional objectives – tertiary colours, additional income and so on – for players to aim for. The modules don't drastically alter the game for the better, but at least they make Fresco a good choice for those who want a gateway game with some modularity.

A quick word about the 2P game – I find the dummy player mechanism forced. He does make 'intelligent' decisions since he's alternately controlled by players, but he ends up being a mere pawn to benefit the current controller. I wouldn't recommend Fresco as a 2P game.

2017: 8. I picked this up based on some positive review, the alternate take on worker placement, the neat theme (colour theory!) and the hilarious idea of having to decide when to wake up in the morning.

I initially thought it might be a good game to play with my parents but it's just slightly too complex, but it's been a strong hit with my other gaming groups. I've played 4 times but feel like none of those games "count" since I realized we were playing two key rules wrong (you don't get to cherry pick paint from *any* stall, you only get paint from *one* stall; and the painting actions are all separate, not all at once, and the bishop moves to the painted tile after each action) so now I'm even more eager to get the game back to the table and test different strategies and tactics.

Despite this, I think it's still a pretty strong 8, a good mid-weight euro with a unique theme that looks great on the table and is pleasing to a wide range of gamers.

The theme and mechanics in the game just melt into each other like butter. Just in thinking about this game, I feel like it should be even higher on my list. Maybe it would be if I played it more. I love the decisions you have to make throughout- do you get up early to ensure you have first pick of the market? Or do you sleep in later to make your people happy, which could give you an extra worker? You also need to pay attention to what colors your opponents are blending so that you can go after the right fresco tiles. Fellow Euro lovers should really give this game a play!!

Very average Worker-placement Euro. Players are using their workers to buy paint (cubes) in order to paint pieces of a fresco (fulfilling orders) for VPs. There are other devices such as combining cubes to make different colours. And of course, multiple ways to earn VPs.

Pretty dull, paint by numbers (pun intended) Euro. Yawn.

From the Geek Marketplace.

Have played training 4P and 2P with wifey (using base game rules), and really scales well.

In fact if others I play with like it as much as wifey does, it could well take over from Stone Age as my go to worker placement type game.

2015 UPDATE:

Have now experienced the base game and also all the expansions, and still going down well, even with wifey (theme helps!)

Personally I will always play with the Portraits expansion as gives you a set ending to the game, and they give you fairy good bonuses as well.

The extra paints, while ok, seem to just add a bit more time to the game more than anything else.

The Bishops Request tiles, while good for getting some quick points on the board, does eat away at your income, thus making it tougher to balance the books...

Wifey approved.

Akkorát nem ütött, mint amekkora ütést vártam egy Év játéka díjra is jelölt játéktól, de egy nagyon jó kis társasról van szó. Nekem nem is a színkeverés tetszett igazán a játékban, hanem a játékossorrend eldöntésére kitalált mechanizmus. Érdekes, egyedi játék, amiben a játékosok egy nagy freskót festenek közösen, amihez a különböző színeket piacon szerzik meg, majd több győzelmi pontért kevergetik ezeket a megfelelő freskólapka megszerezéséért.

Solid Euro game, with tricky timing elements and decisions whose effects ripple forward into later turns.Very little luck involved, although you could get screwed if you needed a particular combination of pigments that just weren't available in a certain turn. The order of bids for turn order is determined by point order, which should usually hurt the leader, but doesn't actually seem to matter a whole lot. A good strategy seems to be to capitalize on opportunities to get cheap pigments of any color, stockpiling them until you can mix them into secondary colors that work for you.

This is a simultaneous action selection set collection game. The board shows tiles requiring various combinations of paints. Players turn order is initially random, then in reverse score order. Each round begins by players choosing their turn order this round; earlier = pay more for each market item and make your apprentices unhappy (if they're unhappy enough, you lose an apprentice for the turn). Then simultaneously assign your 5 (or 4) apprentices to tasks: buy at market, paint fresco (i.e., collect a tile and collect the associated VP) or work on the altar (turn in a different combination of paints, for fewer VP than most tiles), collect cash, mix paints (primary to secondary, needed for most tiles), or rest (improve happiness). In time order, use your apprentices to conduct their actions. Collect income (1 per tile already completed), then repeat. The final round, triggered by having 6 or fewer fresco tiles available, gives you 2 chances to paint the tiles.

Whenever you score VP, if you land on another player's marker on the track you choose to go in front of them (more VP) or behind (earlier turn order). That's kind of clever, although also seems a bit odd.

This is a nice little game with a lot of decisions to make along the way. But it still plays pretty quickly. Looking forward to trying the advanced versions!

I have the version that comes with the first 3 "modules", or mini-expansions, included.  This is one of the few games that is made more complete with these modules.

The game itself is a simple, and easy to teach and play worker placement game.  Players select their turn order via what time they start work for the day (the earlier you get up the earlier you go but you lose "happiness" which can affect the number of workers you have to place as well as increases your price for buying paint) then secretly select their actions and carry them out based on their turn order.  The end goal being to paint the most (and most valuable) pieces of a fresco.

The theme is really well-done.  Your resources are different colors of paints and you can mix the primary colors to make secondary colors.  I like the idea that getting up early gets you earlier access to all the actions but also costs you happiness and good prices at the market.  This isn't just thematic but also makes for interesting choices in an otherwise by-the-numbers worker placement game.

Where this game really shines though is that this light worker placement game I described above really acts as a framework for which these modules fit perfectly to create a fuller and often more interesting game.  One module adds portraits you can paint for customers that give you a one-time or lasting bonus.  Another gives you the ability to fill orders as another method of scoring bonus points.  The final one adds new tiles and even new paint colors to mix together.

This may replace Lords of Waterdeep for a time as my introductory worker placement game as I'd love to explore the system more.  At least in the interim until Scoundrels of Skullport is released (and I can convince my wife to let me make another game purchase).

It's also worth mentioning that since the resources are based on different colors of paint this isn't the best game to play with color-blind folks.

Played the full version with all the expansions. I didn't find the game particularly challenging specially for the time it takes. It's very boring because I had the feeling of doing the same thing over and over. I know that games are all about doing the same repeatedly but some are more obvious than others and Fresko turned out to be one of these obvious ones.

Components are of excellent quality as in Queen standards and the artwork is also very beautiful.

I like some of the mechanisms of the game such as the mood of the players and the turn choice. It's cool to make such a decision and there's no clear choice very often. Most of the time there's a lot to consider before making the decision and I like that.

The game is fine enough.  I find that every turn feels like you are scrambling to do whatever you can with whatever it is you have available and whatever it is you have left.  Maybe it is because I have only played it twice, but it does not feel like you are really able to formulate a long term strategy.

A great, tight, streamlined game. While I have had the opportunity to pick up all of the expansions, and they are currently still on my wishlist, I feel like all they would do is add complication and time to an otherwise solid game. I don't want it to be "deeper." I love it for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played the basic version twice, and to be honest this game is vastly overrated.  It's not that it is a bad game, it's just not fun.  The play process is extremely mechanical with the player actions having almost no effect on the board, barring increasing along the VP track.  There is some slightly AP which can crop up for some players because of the need to plan for the next turn at the very start of the current turn.

Caveat is that we've played only the basic game so far, and will try again with the 'expansions' but I feel that it is unlikely to change my opinion as I had no problem with the play of the mechanics, only with the tension and excitement in the game.

This is another game in an increasing line of game which add play mechanics to the mix without improving the more important tension in the game.

I have no problem playing this in a group again, but it will never come out by my choice.

Purple, the royal color, is the elusive tint that can only be achieved by mixing paints.  So we picked up buckets of red and blue, and yellow for that matter, to mix for extra orange and green.  Combinations of colors (got a purple, red and yellow?) were cashed in to score tiles for VP.  You also had to have an income in order to keep buying paint.  Budgeting was a nagging issue from start to finish.  Wonderful game if you enjoy juggling details.  Pile all jolly in for the paint-collecting thing, make sure you get some, for on that all else depends.

Some theme play.  Fairly easy to learn, but easy to play.  Base game is straight forward but the 3 expansions included add some spice to the game.  Great family game!  Components are excellent - colorful mounted board, thick chits and wood playing pieces.  Rulebook is well organized and has examples, but is unclear on a couple of aspects.  Game length is about 1.5 hours which feels right.

Great theme with a lot of interesting decisions. I played with the glaziers/windows expansion plus the portaits, bonus mixes, and addded paint colors. I wish there were more opportunities for other players to interact, and I'm not sure it has strong replayability due to the sometimes repetitive nature of trading in cubes for points, but I would like to play it again definitely.

Without the in-box expansions the game is broken in the sense that players must avoid painting for the first 3-4 turns, because players in the lead are heavily penalized.
The in-box expansions do remedy this sufficiently, so I would recommend to use them all (at least the one with the bishop's errands).

I'm rating this one at 8.5 for the 4-player game.  It's full of delicious decisions, most of which revolve around the "wake up time" mechanism.  There's a lot to like here.  Fairly easy to teach and play, yet full of decisions.  

The rating of 2 is for the 2-player game which is just no fun.  I hate dummy players in games and this may actually be worse.  I'm sure my rating will increase with more players so I will adjust it accordingly.

Light Euro Games, I like the bidding for turn order phase determine market price and your worker mood changes, and all the things like mixing paints, and painting fresco, it all make sense while still being thematic enough.

We played Fresco with all expansions in right from the start.  I'm glad we did because it makes for a good tense game.  It has a lot of setup but it's length outlasts any ill feelings towards that.  

2 player with the dummy 'Leonardo' - We use him for Jerk moves mostly but also 'get him out of the way' times as well.  I don't really like him but he works well as the take that piece.

There is a lot of moving parts to contend with.  With a glass or two of wine in you, keeping track of all you are doing is a little laborious. 

Overall - good game that I like to play.

update : with the game tonight it solidified itself as a fun 2 player game.  Leo still sucks to use but we mainly get him out of the way.  It was a one point photo finish tonight. Good stuff!

Elsô benyomásom elég jó. A játék nagyon szép. Ami nagyon tetszett benne, hogy megtörte a szimmetriát: a piacon nem lehet venni lila festéket. Ha szimmetrikus lenne, akkor ahogy lehet venni zöldet és narancsot, úgy lehetne venni lilát is, de nem, és ez szerintem jó. Úgyhogy a lila színhez csak két akcióval lehet hozzájutni, míg a többi színhez akár eggyel (alapjátékról van szó)

This excellent DSP winner is simple to learn, and yet still presents quite a challenge to be as efficient as possible when obataining and mixing paints.  The turn order mechanism is brilliant, as the last place player gets first crack to choose turn order, but going first has its own drawbacks.  I would certainly use all three mini expansions that are included, but the bare base game would probably be enjoyable as well, and a little simpler to teach.

The Big Box edition is daunting, but well designed with a plethora of mini modules that you can chop and change. And mixing paints!

Really nice game, of the same kind of 'heaviness' as Stone Age.  Flows really nicely, with plenty of decisions but without burning the brain too much. Really enjoy the 'blend paints' mechanism, along with the choice to when to get up (first to market for the best paints, but they'll cost more, and you'll negatively affect the mood of your apprentices, meaing you might lose a worker).

Great components. Interesting game play. Not very interactive except indirectly. Really enjoy the tough decisions in terms of when to wake up.

RATING: 4
Mixing paint may be the most intuitive introduction to resource-conversion, and that's good.  But Fresco is smothered in balancing mechanisms that generate busy work without being interesting.  It seems to require a gamemaster to call out whose turn it is, up to 20 times per round, in an oddly mathy and stuttering experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If someone has even a passing interest in Renaissance art, drag them over to play Fresco. Simple enough to count as a gateway game (if the theme resonates) and with enough mechanics that make you feel like you're always doing well, Fresco is a winner.

RATING: 7
Rating after one game at Essen 2010. Nice simultaneous action selection game with elements of worker placement. (Placing a worker does not prevent others from performing the action, but depending on player order they have less choices or less to gain with the actions). In the beginning, we had difficulties to recognize our options at the fresco, so a turn took some time, especially for the AP prone players. Later in the game, you get used to the color combinations and the options are less, so it flows faster. We played without the built-in expansions, so the  game probably lacked some depth. We did not buy it because we have enough resource collecting/ managing and worker placement games.

Gorgeous game and the theme fits perfectly with the mechanics. Plays fine with 2 players using a low-maintenance dummy player.

Update: I like the gameplay and the look of the game a lot, but I wonder if the game is maybe a little too balanced. Kind of like the game plays itself. The player in last place gets to place their apprentice painters first, which seems like too strong of a catchup mechanic.

I very much like how this game is put together. There are multiple paths to victory, yet the game does not feel particularly complex. The theme is a friendly one which I think would appeal to many non gamers. Even when not doing well, the game is fun because there are still quite a few options available. Additionally, this game has some strong come from behind opportunities built in. I may actually increase my rating to a 9 after additional plays.

SOLD 1/2015 --- The Spiel des Jahres  had yet to be awarded to Dixit at the time, so I jumped at the opportunity to next try one of the top contenders for the award - Fresco. Unfortunately, the Queen demo team wanted to stick to the basic game rather than include any of the "advanced" rules. I had a feeling from reading on the Geek that this was going to make the game too simple to be interesting and that turned out to be exactly right. I’m still interested in trying Fresco again, but with the basic rules the game is simply bland and insipid. The much vaunted choose-when-you-wake-up mechanic, which controls turn order and prices, was not nearly as inspired as had been touted. The game was simply entailed spending coins to purchase cubes and using actions to convert cubes into victory points. I had thought at the time that this might win the Spiel des Jahres since it was time to give the award to Queen, but now I’m glad that something else took the prize. I was personally pulling for A La Carte since Karl-Heinz deserves a "lifetime achievement" award like Knizia, but Dixit isn’t a bad choice and certainly has the expandable element they’re looking for. I had the chance to play both Samarkand and Fresco with Brad Keen of the Dice Tower who is great to game with, and it was nice to be taught both games by Queen staff, but in the end both were a letdown.

Two plays under my belt - one 3-player and one 4-player.  The 3-player I won barely (even though we were playing the bishop wrong), and the 4-player, I lost by a large margin, because I was "playing it safe".  Also, we had some really weird markets where there was a LOT of yellow for sale in one stall.  My GF likes this one, so on the wishlist it goes.

RATING: 7
[thing=66188][/thing] is a light to medium weight work placement, where you must also decide ahead of time your actions for the turn - considering, after you decide in what hours will your painters wake up, how many you will send to:
- buy paints;
- actually do some painting;
- collect payments;
- blend colors;
- to get time off (which will make them happier and, with this, you might avoid losing workers or even gain more).

You buy paints to use them into paiting the ceiling of the church (the main way to get VPs). Also, the basic colors: yellow, blue and red, can be used to produce green, orange and purple - almost all parts of the paint job require these blended colors. The money you use to buy paints, that, for some reason, are costier early in the morning - maybe your workers don't do research or spend a lot in cofee.

Also, the earlier your workers wake up, more grumpier they will be, and even one or two of them can leave. But if you treat them right, the overall happiness in your shop could attract more workers.

The game is smartly made, all the mechanics work together pretty well, and also the game is beautiful.

There isn't anything major wrong with it, but also nothing really awesome about it. A solid work placement that plays somewhat fast and can be teached in 10 minutes. A good game sure, but there are many ahead of it in the same time frame and weight - like [thing=97207][/thing], [thing=58421][/thing] and [thing=104006][/thing].

RATING: 7.2
1 play of the base version - interesting worker placement game.  Need to manage your paint supply well, whilst trying to keep your workers happy enough to gain an extra one.  Knowing when to get up early is a key decision.  Looking forward to trying again with the expansions.

Players are acting like artisans. They have to restore a fresco in a Renaissance church.

The game has a modular structure giving the players the opportunity to decide how ambitiously they want to play.
New features such as deciding one's own wake-up time (and therefore one's mood for the rest of the day ;-) will make this game unique.
The modular structure will attract casual as well as experienced players.

A typical worker placement game with players taking turns buying paints to complete a masterpiece on the ceiling of a chapel. There is nothing terribly new in terms of mechanics for this game. The inverse turn order to current leading player in the score track is reminiscent of Power Grid. Familiar elements such as securing initiative at the expense of increased costs and lower morale are elements that can found in many other worker placement games. However this game integrates the mechanics very well with theme. All the actions matches the narrative: waking up early to buy paints in the market to get the best but most costly paints while causing some consternation from the workers makes good sense. Also working to paint the chapel and getting favors from the bishop while getting an external income to support the workers in the mass market feels logical. 

The only gripe I have is the underutilized scoring from painting the altar. It feels like a tacked on scoring mechanism to alleviate the pain of collecting paints but being unable to paint the ceiling tiles during the final round of the game. A consolation price to placate the losing artist for missing out on the main event. Seems like a slight tweak of the rewards for painting the altar should make this more competitive.

RATING: 6
Solid meadium weight euro-game. 

After one play, I was a bit dissapointed to found that it seemed almost impossible to play a strategy that starts by making the easier paint jobs. It is kind of counter-intuitive that if you will have to get the most expensive ones first to do well in the game. So if this is true, the strategy space seems to be smaller than it could be, which would be a shame.

Finally a Eurogame with a unique theme! I really enjoy the mechanic of mixing paint colors and would like to try the pink and brown paint expansion. The basic game is just that-- basic, but I am definitely interested in trying out the many expansion modules. I have found that I prefer worker placement Euros where you plan out all of your actions for the round, then resolve them (Dominant Species comes to mind) rather than taking actions on a turn by turn basis.

Somewhat interesting game but the gameplay and choices felt a bit loose and was plagued by a bit of randomness.  The game contained a bunch of interesting mechanics which I enjoyed individually but the gameplay as a whole fell pretty flat for me.  

I also personally wasn't a fan of the hidden information as it makes it difficult to plan effectively (hence the "loose" comment above).  It would be quite a serious memory exercise to try and figure out what everyone had, especially as players tend to get impatient and overlap their actions with another players.   Making information/paint open is probably a terrible solution though as I can see this leading to major AP.  

I'm not saying it's a bad game.  It just wasn't for me.  I think the take away point here is that if you like open information and the ability to plan effectively think twice before buying this game.  I would classify this game as more of a push your luck style game than a typical euro or strategy game.  I however, imagine it could be a good gateway game because it doesn't reward deep analysis and can be played intuitively and quickly without too much penalty.  The rules were also simple to learn and the mechanics were fairly intuitive and well tied into the theme.

I would play again if it's all that is going to hit the table at a games night or if all the other proposed options were woeful.  However there are an absolute ton of new games I would rather try or old games I would rather play again over this.

As an art history major I really like the theme for this Euro.  The game plays smoothly with a lot of brainy decisions to be made.  The dummy third player in the two player game works fine.  My only gripe is that I wish the Fresco on the playing board was drawn more like a real fresco.  It looks badly drawn to me.  Birthday present from my wife 2010.

One play, basic rules. A good medium-weight game, a novel theme, and certainly pretty. I could see this as a Spiel des Jahres nominee.  However it did seem reminiscent of other games, in particular Diamonds Club and Blue Moon City. Like DC you collect resource type A which you to combine to create resource type B and then combine again to obtain VP-yielding C; you can go earlier in player order but your purchases will be more expensive. Like BMC there is a display of tiles which you claim by giving up a resource combination of the right colour, gaining a bonus from moving a non-player piece towards the tile being claimed.

Surprising.  Usually if something is nominated for the Spiel des Jahres, it is too light for my tastes.  There's quite a bit to this one.  The theme and components are fantastic.  There's also some pretty neat decision points, particularly for painting pieces of the Fresco and combining them to get points and color income every turn.  The mood track and the morning wake-up also present interesting choices.  This isn't going to convince anybody who doesn't already like Euros, but for those that like them, this is an interesting game.  Make sure you play the advanced version with experienced gamers.

Though i love the idea of the theme I ultimately find this game soulless/dry. Even with the expansion I feel the choice of when you want to go in the turn is fairly straight forward. I think I would find it more interesting if you had to give up priority in one area to gain ground in another. Get paints later in order to paint portraits earlier that sort of thing. It's not a bad game especially taken as a family game, I would choice it over an Alhambra for example but it's still pretty forgettable.

A really top notch game.  Gamers should go right with the expansions.  Frankly, given the SdJ bias toward light games lately, I got much more than I was expecting.  Solid game with a really well integrated theme.

Nice action selection game. I've only been playing a few action selection style games, so for me this is fresh.

As a gamer, you really want to add all three expansions. The base game can indeed be used as a more casual family game .

Nice art and production.

nice simple game, very good use of the theme, normally good components. Nothing new in the mechanics maybe but everything works fine. A nice family game, probably too simple for the hardcore gamer.

Played with my daughter the first time. I really liked it. You have to plan ahead but sometimes a person will goof it up by buying colors you want, so try and use a alternate plan. It flows easy and is a lot of fun buying colors to buy center tiles to expose the Fresco. We only played the basic game but it comes with 3 other expansions. They are easy to use but we wanted to learn the basic game first. I can hardly wait to play it again. A must buy if you love art work and painting.

This is a fun, light game. I love all the different colored cubes. Randomizing the ink tiles for the market every round is a bit of a pain, though.
Update: Gave this version away when I acquired the Big Box edition.

RATING: 7
So good (as long as you play with the included "expansions").  The theme and mechanics mesh pretty well for what is, at its core, a cube-pushing euro.  I'll gladly play Fresco just about any time.

RATING: 7
The base game of Fresco is a very straightforward gateway game, just as easy as Catan or Ticket to Ride. It has a catch-up mechanism, which won't appeal to competitive gamers. More advanced players will need the expansion modules that come in the box, or one of the other expansions to make the game interesting.

Also includes [GAMEID=109140] module

I first played this at the UK BGE 2013 when I was randomly "accosted" by the demonstrator as I walked past the table. 

At first as we went through the rules, I thought it was going to be a very boring game (I'm not into art, really, and am definitely not into religion, and it's basically painting a chapel roof. Note: This game is [i]in no way[/i] religious). Once we started playing, I really enjoyed both the theme and the mechanic, and after playing, I hunted high and low for a copy at the expo itself - I was in, and wanted my own straight away. Of course, they had sold out...

Since then I have bought the game, I played it a few times with none of the modules (even those in the main box) for fear of adding complexity with new players. However, I needn't have worried; as noted in the plays list, while the expansions add complexity for complete beginners to the game, they're not so complex as to break anything, and the game ran very well. 

I've backed the big box on KS, and am anxiously awaiting my new copy and new board :D

Played only and always with the first three expansions (included with the purchase of the base game). This is a good game that scales well with two using a dummy player called Leonardo. While I am generaly not a fan at all of using dummy players, this one works well since we only need to do a couple of things with him, and he adds a certain bit of strategy to the game as well since he is used by both players.

RATING: 9.25
High level of family fun.  Easy to teach, great combination of tactics and strategies, gorgeous to look at.  

With three expansion modules inside the base game, it entices new gamers with immersive play while satisfying the veteran euro-crowd.  Love it.  

The game board is beautiful.  Part of the enjoyment of playing is contemplating your moves while treating your eyes with the artwork and fresh colors in the different sections of the board.  Best of all is watching the Fresco as it is slowly revealed during gameplay.

One of my daughter's favorite games.  Though she isn't a gamer, she becomes enthralled as she plays this fine title.  Makes gaming dad misty-eyed...  :)

[played using all "advanced" expansions]

The game has quite a clever representational scheme - the correspondence between the primary/secondary/tertiary color mixing levels and the cube sizes.  The size-based system could (and should) be emulated in other cube-trading games.

Also, if you've got a thing for electromagnetic frequencies, the color mixing theme does serve as a helpful mnemonic when determining which pair of "goods" (paints) trades up to another type.

Goods by any other name still bore me to tears, however.  You can't hide a standard cube-swapper under a veneer of artistry and light physics and hope that no one will notice.

In terms of gameplay mishaps, it's despairingly easy to have your face ground into the dirt due to turn order shuffling in the final round.  Apparently, you really, really, really (emphasis on the "really") don't want to be ahead in points compared to your main competitor - or anyone else at all, truthfully - going into the last turn.  That one tile you needed to win?  Oh, it's gone. Sweet.

Very good set collecting game. You have to collect colors to mix together to make other colors. I had a little trouble planning my moves so was kinda slow. Other players are looking at the same options as you and turn order can kill you.

Great game all about making a fresco in a church. Trying to buy and mix paints to pzint sertain parts of the fresco.

We included the 3 expansions from the start and adds some good veraity.

While the base game is a gateway game i had trouble with some AP choosing what action i was going to do and what colours to pick. I usually don't have a problem with choosing actions but this one for some reason it wasn't straitforward

First play was uninspiring but we got the rules wrong. Second and third play with no expansions was solid. Still felt like it needed the expansions to open it up a bit. Without them you are significantly at the mercy of what is available in the market which makes any planning of questionable value.Stone Age without the dice?

Pretty light without the modules, but there is plenty of planning ahead and strategizing to be done. You have to really plan ahead, and utilize blocking at the market/cathedral. This game also features one of the best 2-player dummy systems I've played.

The Special Blend and Portrait modules are easily added into the game and open up some big scores and boosts. I will always try to play with these 2 (except for a teaching game) but I haven't tried the Bishop's Request.

Game mechanics are excellent and just work. Everybody simultaneously places workers on their own board behind a screen and wake up time determines whether or not you get to do what you want to do. But waking up early has its costs. Great eurogame and love that the different modules can be added accordingly to ramp the difficulty level to match the gaming audience. The two-player experience is great as the dummy player is clean and done correctly.

Everybody in my group wants to like this game more, but the rules have some flaws.  Game falls into a rut where the 2 lowest scoring players shutout the other two from the market every turn.  The 1st and 2nd place players end up with little to do other than accumulate 9 thaler every turn until they fall back into 3rd or 4th place and can get more paint.  Everyone gets bored when they are just treading water.  The extra apprentice ends up being worthless.  The expansions help a bit, but not enough.

I mainly bought this because I thought my wife would enjoy the theme; she does, but not as much as expected. The game is a little too simple, and the decision-making a little too obvious, for my tastes, even with the included modules. The moment when the apprentices are revealed is fun though.

2011-01-05: [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] Like everyone's already saying, play this game with the three included "expansion modules".  In fact, playing with [thing=86048]The Scrolls[/thing] is even better.  The "expansion modules" add negligible complexity to the rules, but enhance the decision space significantly.

After 1 Play: The game just didn't provide anything interesting.  It starts with a pretty boring resource management core and adds... nothing.  Get cubes, turn them into other cubes, turn them into points.  Be slightly more efficient at it.  Some games can get away with this rather boring structure because they have other interesting things going on.  This one doesn't.

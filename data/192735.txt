A brave distilling of [b]Witch's Brew[/b] to its essence.  [b]Broom Service[/b] turned [b]WB[/b] into an overwrought board game.  This one is (essentially) the "mittbringspiel" version of [b]WB[/b].  It gives you the flavor of the original in half the time and half the box size.  Good one.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
The simplest game with the Brave / Cowardly mechanism.  The mechanism even in this simple game is still fun, but would much prefer to play Broom Service / Witches Brew.  The game is really quick, so defiantly of the 3 is more filler material.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One play each with three and six players. Three is very quick, the game can be over in 15 minutes, but there's also not a huge point in playing; I'd rate it a 5. But six players was amazing. This is how you make a card game version of another game! Shorter and lighter, but that fundamental essence of the game intact. With six players I'd rate it a 9. So the rating is 7, an average.

Érzetre, alapmechanikára nagyon hasonlít a a witch's brew-ra és a broom servicre.
Ugyanúgy szerepeket választunk bátran vagy gyáván.Ha a bátrunkat felülcsapják, akkor semmit se kapunk, de ha bejön, akkor jóval jövedelmezőbb, mint a gyáva, ami viszont garantált. Ezúttal sok-sok kártya közül választunk minden fordulóra hármat, és csak gyűjtögetjük a sikeresen kijátszottakat. Ha sikerül valamelyik célnak megfelelő szettet kitenni, akkor azt felmarkoljuk, illetve a játék végén minden szettünk ér valamennyi pontot.
Pro: gyors, party jelleg, lenyűgöző ötlet ez a bátor/gyáva szerepválasztós mechanika.
Kontra: ahogy a testvérekben is, igen nagy tud lenni a káosz, emiatt nem szabad igazán komolyan venni. Önhibánkon kívül is kerülhetünk rossz helyzetbe. A célok szerintem kicsit túl költségesek voltak, nagyon nehéz őket teljesíteni.

RATING: 6
It's quite hard to tease out what my rating of this would have been if I had never played Broom Service: the Board Game.  Essentially, this is the brave/coward mechanism coupled with a routine set collection aspect.  Of course, the major fun is in the brave/coward stuff going on in the Board Game.  But all the additional stuff going on in that game is what prevents the core mechanism from being the deciding factor in the game.  It shouldn't be, because ultimately it is a press-your-luck mechanism, which is never really a good thing for deciding mid-weight game results.  Isolating that mechanic in this game was an interesting idea, but there were enough turns where you choosing brave/coward felt ultimately like a crapshoot.  It's an okay game, but the "push your luck" felt more random than tactical.  Anyway - biggest conclusion is that if you already have Broom Service: The Board Game, then I can't think of a good reason to have this, unless you want a light game for a large group that can create a few laughs.  But I'd question long-term replayability on this one.  I like pulling out the Board Game every now and then.  I feel like playing The Card Game would burn me out on what I find most enjoyable about the Board Game.  Also, the green potions look like dildos. Just sayin'.

RATING: 6
Very simple version of Broom Service/Witches brew. It distills everything down to playing cards as brave/cowardly as all rewards are the same

You are just going for big sets of each color or completing the goals. Light sub 30 min game

RATING: 7
By far not as good as the board game, but much faster. So if you do not have much time and want to be BRAVE this is the game to choose :)

RATING: 7
It's not Witch's Brew or Broom Service, and it isn't trying to be. It is simply the brave/cowardly mechanism distilled. The reason this works is because that is such a great mechanism. It's a decent filler, but of the three games, Witch's Brew is still my clear favorite.

Kártyajátékból táblás játék, majd abból egy újabb kártyajáték. És a sor végén van a sorozat legegyszerűbb darabja. Ezzel a kártyajátékkal lehet jól megtanítani a bátor és gyáva szerepek közötti különbséget. Annyira egyszerű kártyajáték, hogy már 5-6 évesek is simán tudnak vele játszani. Éppen ezért gyakorlott játékosoknak nem való, inkább csak gyerekekkel való játékra javaslom.

At first I thought "oh I bet my co-workers will like this game" as there are light card counting elements and betting/speculating what other players are doing... but by the end of the game, I realized there was a pattern of everyone picking only one color to play, usually being able to call brave on their three cards. Could be a weird group think thing? But it totally made the game less interesting.

Played with 6, and we were wanting a filler, so it did meet those requirements quite well. There is that.

Was on my wish list and I finally picked it up.  In some respects, I almost prefer it to the board game.  It plays a bit more like Witch's Brew, which is not a bad thing.  Lots of fun to play, with lots of replay value.

RATING: 6.5
Obtain bonus points by matching symbols on the cards you play each hand - but the catches are (a) one card is selected from the three on the board and so you know some limitations, and (b) if someone declares heroic after you, that card is negated [so it's best to go coward unless you are definitely going to win].

PLUS: easy to learn, plays fast
MINUS: it becomes clear you can't win a hand unless you are last player for that set of cards

I have not yet played Broom Service, though I am a fan of Witches Brew. This does exactly what you would expect. Unlike the Castles of Burgundy card game, the core mechanism of trying to not choose what everyone else does lends itself well to distillation. It's still not that exciting or fun, but I can see why they chose to make the game. Since it is so quick, I don't mind playing it. But the competition is fierce and this does little to distinguish itself.

This card game version of one of my favorite games is absolutely dreadful, and pales in comparison to the excellent Burgundy card game. It's honestly baffling to me how this next-of-kin to Broom Service and Witches Brew could fall so short of what those games did so well. Instead, it's a terribly random and frustrating exercise in futility. However, it gets a few points for coming packed with a nice expansion for its superior older brother and it fits inside that bigger box entirely. That's the only reason I'm keeping it.

So much luck and lack of control. Also still colorblind unfriendly like original, though numbers help a bit. But they should've written quantities on cards!

Edit: ah, the designer politely messaged me telling me the quantities on the cards are the numberings themselves - okay good for that a least. Still hate the game though.

First play was by the wrong rules and that would have resulted in a devastating low score (it's wasn't clear that you had to have ALL the flasks on the task cards, which made they were all gone after round 2 :s and there was also no drawing of extra cards). 

If played by the correct rules, it's an OK card game, that's ideal as a filler and simply combines the brave/cowardly - mechanism with the common principle of having 10 brown, 11 green,... , 20 grey cards, so you have a statistically better chance  of playing successfully a brown card brave then a grey one.

The expansion for the board game it contains is however excellent, as it makes you can do something useful if you have a card which you can't execute.

While I find the board game outstaying its welcome a bit, this is good at doing what it's trying to achieve. Lots of outguessing and educated guessing compressed into a 20 minute session that doesn't outstay its welcome. Plays well with six and fits the travel filler category well. Bonus that it comes with a Broom Service Board Game expansion. Would make a good give for infrequent gamers too.

[Alea 2016 Edition] {Witches; trick-taking, double-guessing, set-collection; optimal 5-6p} This is a cute filler game, with a good mix of tactics and luck.  The game inherits the fun part from Witch's Brew - double guessing to brave or coward.  Now, the start player can go coward.

Players can choose to either go for the bonus cards, or avoid crash to select suits that are hardly wanted in order to collect more potions for points.  Card counting can help.

The illustration is nice, but I wish that the cards would be larger.

tl;dr: enjoyable family game

This game takes the board game based on the card game and turns it into a card game again. Kind of like what Knizia did with the Keltis card game I guess.
In any case: again the fun card mechanism is retained and packages it in an enjoyable if somewhat luck driven game that certanly is different enough from both the board game and [thing=10][/thing].

Great on paper, incredibly lame in practice. Too much competition packed into too short a time frame means that even a single mis-play can take you out of the running. 

I suppose that for an ostensibly 20 minute game, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but there's way too much fiddle-faddling around with a ton of those tiny cards to merit playing this over a wide variety of other super-fillers.

A shame, really. But proof that you *can* distill a game down too far.

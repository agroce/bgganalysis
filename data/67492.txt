An interesting variant on the "Battlelore/Memoir/C&C" schtick. It's certainly not bad, but I'm not sure if that franchise isn't being stretched too thin at this point. More time at the table will be needed for this one.

Wargame ligero, ambientado en la saga de Juego de Tronos, no muy complejo, asequible y con variedad y estrategia para aburrir :D Muy muy chulo. Y el sistema de dados, mecánicas por fichas o cartas de ordenes, enfrentamientos, flanqueos, especialidades de tropas, tipos de terreno, etc. lo hacen muy interesante, fluido y con posibilidades tácticas enormes.

Se dice mejor que Battlelore, C&C Ancients y Memoir '44. Lo cierto es que prefiero la mecánica por órdenes de comandante de cartas y fichas, antes que partir el terreno en 3. Tiene mucho más sentido, táctico y temático.

Expansiones aportan más tropas y opciones, sobretodo la caja grande de Baratheon, con todas sus tropas, habilidades de comandantes, y el mapa del río y el castillo, más terrenos, catapultas, magia de sangre, fuego valirio...
Aunque con el básico hay 10 escenarios predefinidos y opción de crearlos tu mismo. Hay juego para muuchas partidas.

RATING: 3
Worst out-of-the-box experience in the history of gaming.  You have to assemble and glue all your own minis, and the complete lack of an insert for all the minis and tokens will have you wondering why bother with it all.  FFG dropped the ball on the production here, and may have killed minis for me altogether.

The game itself is fine -- the production and packaging are what warrants the horrific rating.

A good game that simulates warfare in the medieval period or earlier well with a emphasis on leaders and on top of that keeping your units in formation. For example, so they can be 'Stalwart' and be able to counterattack if attacked. Also, the extra tokens that can move units out or in command mitigates situations of the luck of the draw for the cards. The ability after playing the scenarios to 'buy' your army setup is also a improvement from C&C Ancients and adds to the replayability. 

Downside are the miniatures that are beautiful but tend to fall off the bases and the banners that need to be turned to represent used units are a chore and tend to fall off too. All this also adds to the setup time but can be fixed by putting the banners on the board and using tokens instead of extra miniatures to represent the extra troops in a units. 

In conclusion, a good game with a lot of narrative and strategic value.

Jestem zachwycony tą grą. Pierwsza rozgrywka zajmuje nieco więcej czasu (zapoznanie się z regułami gry nie jest takie trudne, lecz elementów jest bardzo dużo, przez co aby ogarnąć całość potrzeba roszkę więcej czasu) jednak po kilku bitwach gra toczy się bardzo dobrze. Bitwy Westeros są świetną formą rozwoju nutki stratega w sobie.

RATING: 4
Bought it because we had tried Memoir 44 and liked the mechanics of it, but thought the theme would suit us better. Sadly this game was a bit more over-complicated than Memoir 44 and killed our favorite things about it--the simplicity of using card-based combat to *limit* your decisions (so you don't spend all day bogged down in rules over available actions) but still allow you a lot of interesting decisions. BoW just got too crazy-complicated with more dice, more fancy special figurines, leaders, stats, FLAGS that you turn this way and that... it wasn't what we were looking for

Lots of nice figures and interesting improvements in battle system (compared to Battlelore, for example) can't hide the fact that this is purely a dice throwing game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The combat system is broken by the use of 8 sided dice and the mess that all the flags and counters create without adding anything. 

The major consequence of using an 8 sided die is that flags are rarer and thus useless (if a unit can ignore at least one flag, which happens most of the time, you have minimal chances of repulsing it). Also red units esp heavy cavalry becomes too hard to take down while green units get slaughtered just by breathing down on them.

Also suffers from bad production issues (the minis don't fit in the stands and need to be glued!) which is very unlike FFG. Furthermore the abysmal manual and bad playtesting make the game broken. 

What a pity... I had high hopes about this one...

RATING: 6
I made the mistake of getting all the expansions along with the base game before playing this.  I found the mechanics to be "Over the Top" when it comes to playing the game.  I did not enjoy having to turn flags every time I had to restart my turn.  Unlike Battle Cry, where you had cards to state where the troops were moving, you had to use flags to show which units were active and which were in "reserve."  I thought that it was too much to deal with every time instead of just playing the game.  I think most of the time we were playing, we were turning flags.  

10/23/2015 - Update on Gameplay

I finally buckled down and began to play through the scenarios and am up to 7 out of the ten in the core set.  I am still underwhelmed when it comes to the Commands and Colors system.  I prefer Ancients or Battle Cry mainly due to the flag system and the overall ease of wiping out a unit due to counterattacks and special abilities.  

12/1/2015 - Update on Gameplay

We have slowed down in playing through the scenarios, but I will say that the game is more enjoyable once you get into the groove of setup and gameplay as a whole.  This is not anywhere near a commands and colors system and neither is it truly battlelore.  It is a world unto itself.  That being said, there is still a lot to be desired in a game like this.

Another in the Command and Colors series, done by FFG in their usual over the top construction. I simply don't like playing games that have a million different pieces. Did we really need flags to keep track of who was active? Why not do away with the whole active / inactive system? Also this game does not utilize the left/center/right field sectors, being even more centered around leaders. In the end I did enjoy playing it but I would certainly not be interested in owning a copy. I'll stick to Command & Colors: Ancients from GMT.

Not sure why I ever buy these types of games.  I could not even give it away on BGG, as the person who "won" the game in January 2014 never claimed the prize (the buyer had to pay shipping, and this turkey won't fly on its own, so that might have been the turning point).  Why, I could not even give it away to my brother, who loves the Fire & Ice series.  I finally unloaded it, still in shrink, thank goodness, at Noble Knights for some store credit.  Sheesh.

RATING: 6
It's a pretty good variation of Battlelore, and with a theme I like. Unfortunately, I thought every new rule (leaders-based orders, flanking amd hero powers) makes the game a bit worse than Battlelore, although might improve on the multiplayer aspect. Still a very good game, but I'd play BL over it any day of the day.

They finally managed to fix c&c system. 8-sided dice, new methods of unit activation, good theme, whole armies move and fight instead of just 3-4 units, there are alternative victory conditions too!

I bought the game only because it was on sale. After gluing the pieces to their bases and reading the rules, I decided to not even play it because it is a little too technical for my taste.

It hurts to say it but I found Battles of Westeros pretty disappointing: actually I expected a light fantasy wargame, hence I was shocked to find out it’s a deep and fiddly game requiring too much strategic planning than I wished it to have.

Don’t get me wrong, Battles of Westeros is a great game and its well-suited theme makes it even greater: it’s just not the game I wanted, since all I wished for was a fantasy version of Memoir ‘44.

RATING: 4
FFG's lame attempt to use BL's mechanics mutated by FFG's "vision" of a tactical game.

Most new mechanics are more trouble than they are worth. Turning flags around, removing/placing tokens all the time just to gain a few gameplay mechanics that the previous games already have solved with elegance.

The only really good mechanic, the morale track, is a complete failure since its game effect is significantly lower than it should have been.

Red units are tanks now, green units are worthless. Flag results from the dice are now so important that the d8's make the whole ordeal look extremely luck-driven.

Unit's weapons don't affect the gameplay at all.

Biggest problem of all and possibly game-breaking are the game's feature nontheless, the Leaders. They are too tough to kill so that most of the time they are parked on objective hexes giving the attacker a really frustrating time trying to dislodge them. And remember how I've mentioned about the d8's making the game more random.

All in all, this game is mediocre at best, C&C: Ancients and BattleLore are way better. It tries to develop the mechanics more but it accomplishes nothing in the end.

Theme is only there as bait since the books have nothing to do with tactical battlefield combat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I gave this one a half-dozen tries when it first appeared. It seemed to strip away all the elegant things that I liked about the original BattleLore and replaced them with more conventional wargame mechanics that made the game more complex and take longer to play. Flanking, Morale, the fusion of leader figures into heavy units to make them virtually unbeatable, and the double penalty against light units (fewer dice and fewer chances to hit on those dice) all made for a less compelling game for me.

Favourite of the C&C games, although this isn't really one (it's branded a battlelore game but the main mechanic is different - dice for activation rather than cards).

I really like the differences - it has put the emphasis on leaders, and there is a bit of cat/mouse with the activations and the rally cards, and the morale rules make sense, you start off confident and as you take losses you risk your army fading away, rather than just suffer X units and the game is over.

Traded Battlelore after getting this - it works so much better for me than that game.

Own House Baratheon & Wardens of the North.

Interesting take on Borg's C&C system.  It eliminates the free flowing action of C&C by restricting units to a single activation every other turn.  They attempt to mitigate the luck of command activations too by giving somewhat more controlled individual unit activation mixed with restricted range card activation of multiple units.  I like it.

Cool scenarios, great components and super mechanics.
I really like this game and the fact that it is on the realistic side, without magic.
The game carries the theme pretty good, I think. But that might come with knowing the story and playing the according scenarios.

The only flaws are the need to glue ALL the units and the bad glue on the flags for the plastic banners.

I'm not into war games, but I am into Game of Thrones, so this is probably the closest I will ever come to playing a war game. It's pretty fun but kind of generic: you don't get a strong sense that you are playing houses Stark and Lannister here. For a really thematic AGoT war game experience, go no further than A Game of Thrones: The Board Game.

This is a very good game, obviously in the same vein as Battlelore.  After just one play, however, I still enjoy BL more.

I like a lot of what BoW has done with the system (i.e. removing the battlefield sections, adding order tokens, commanders), but BL is just more "fun".  I'm hoping that repeated plays will make BoW feel less fiddley (and more "fun"!)

RATING: 9
This is one of my favorite games. As one of those rare people who enjoy a deep theme, and a simple war game that expands upon risk but isn't the same as the full blown, whole table miniature games, this is a perfect fit. Would make sure you have a partner in mind before you buy it.

Cons:
Figures - Took me about 2 hours to get all of my figures based out of the box. Some outright required glue to stay in their stands. Figures not being glued can be an issue during gameplay - albeit a minor one. Figures can be bent as do any plastic figures stored in bags.
Rule Book - Poorly laid out. The book is long and inefficient. There is pertinent information, but there isn't a page with all of it on it. The index page references are incorrect (if it says on page 21 and 22, it will be on 22). Some rules aren't even mentioned. Some command cards aren't properly explained. Ambiguous language. After 3 games, I'm not sure I'm rallying correctly.
Setup - It takes awhile to get going. If I'm going to invite somebody over, you better believe I'll set it up first lest see them give up on it before it starts.

Pros:
Engagement Token - Useful mechanic for tying up units.
Feel of Commanding units
Uniqueness of play differences amongst the Commanders
Carnage - Every turn (after the first) something happens and upsets are common
Satisfaction - Victories are felt and the feeling is good

Rating: 7 - With the possibility of becoming 8 depending on replayability.

This is a great tactical war game.

A nice evolution from the Commands & Colors/Memoir 44 game system. Battles of Westeros takes the system to a whole new level making for some very tense situations.

I also love the theme.

The rulebook has some issues but works fairly well.  Need to download the FAQ to make it work best.

I'm not sure why Fantasy Flight rule books are so poorly edited (so many mistakes and typos).  No excuse for this really with the production quality of the other bits being so high.

Very well done otherwise.

The problem with this game is that the set up/ breakdown time is too long for the reward.  The core mechanics are good and many of the scenarios are interesting.  They are not all balanced but that should not matter with repeated play throughs.  I also am not a fan of how swingy combat results are.  Even if you plan everything by the numbers, die rolls have a habit of crushing all of your plans.  And if a really bad combat does not go your way from the beginning the rest of the game is an uphill battle.  Logically, that should not be a huge turn off but for whatever reason, it is.  

In one game a lucky catapult shot killed Gregor Clegane on his first move.  I didn't even get a chance to do anything with my coolest unit.  That, to me, is not fun.  And so this just does not hit the table.

It has more strategy than Memoir '44. I like being able to use the figures I choose rather than whats available to me from my order cards.  However, although it feels balanced enough (the first scenario has been one by both Stark and Lannister) there seems to be a trend where the battle is "one-sided" with one sided almost completely wiping out the other. This amounts to one player not having very much fun (while the other one likely feels guilty).

Rating after only one incomplete game. I think my rating might still go up after more games, this game looks good! :)
However, I have deducted -0.5 points for the ridiculously horrible figure-base combinations which don't hold in place at all for most figures without glue. I absolutely hate the resulting, unnecessary need to buy the right glue and glue them myself. Because I haven't gotten around to do this so far, I haven't played a second game so far...

Battles of Westeros is a good addition to the M44/C&C/BL series.  I did not miss the 3 zones at all.  The dice worked well for battles and tokens.  The command cards refreshed often, which I really liked.  The tokens worked well.  
The tokens combined with the command cards to create a great mix of public and private information.  Rallying troops was also a nice addition.  
B.O.W. gives you more choices during battle, which gives you a deeper strategy experience.  I think it's a very good game.  The only thing I will say against it is that it will be harder to pick up for players new to the M44/C&C/BL systems
The theme was fine, but it was not something I was considering for any part of the game.

RATING: 6
Initial rating after a couple plays. Not sure how I feel about it.

I do like the individual unit abilities, and loss tracking (by physically removing a mini) seems more reasonable than most miniatures games. The special abilities of the different types of units is a nice touch. The game lacks true ZOC rules and the ability to maneuver around units while adjacent to them feels wrong, but at least it has engagement restrictions and flanking benefits.

However, activating individual units using chits, or leaders that can only activate 2 or 3 units at a time using cards, just doesn't seem to create a realistic ebb and flow to the battle. The morale track seems (almost) pointless, and a separate track for each army would have made more sense. As it is you can end up with both armies virtually annihilating each other without ever breaking.

But, I guess [i]SPQR[/i] and the GBoH series in general has really spoiled me in terms of tactical warfare, so maybe I just have to accept the fact that this is a more accessible game for most people and accept it for what it is.

Battles of Westeros is a nice resdesign of BattleLore. The most important thing that was altered was the way in which you activate your troops. The battle card system that was used in Battle Lore was reworked into a system where heros on the battlefield dictate which units can be activated. Since heroes are normal units, you can move them freely on the battlefield using randomly assigned unit chips and direct them to the "hot spots" on the battlefield. This way, there is almost always something useful you can do with the cards and units you are dealt.

While I do like this enhanced control, I also suspect that this change has quite an influence on the playing time. Since there are a lot more possibilities to consider, turns simply take longer. In my book, this is not a bad thing as I do appreciate the enhanced control.

An interesting take on the Commands and Colors system.   Leaders, the 'psuedo' formations they create, and the unit dice give the system a more realistic battlefield quality vs. the 3 sectors of Memoir 44 and BattleLore.  The Song of Ice and Fire theme doesn't hurt either.

Fixes everything that sucked about BattleLore.  Leader command instead of LCR control, roll your own scenarios out of the box, 8 sided dice.  

Blue and green are STILL exactly the same on the banners even though they fixed them on the dice, so that sucks pretty bad.  Why aren't the banners different shapes?

I like the theme as I like the Martin's Ice and Fire series. Figures are lower quality than Battlelore, however board and the cards are OK same as others components. It's just a variation of Battlelore. I changed banners to plastic ones - should speed up the setup.

RATING: 6
Players represent the houses of Stark and Lannister from A Song of Ice and Fire, and fight out battles.  Heavily based on the Command and Colours system from Richard Borg, this one does away with the gamey left/centre/right and puts more emphasis on the relative position of leaders and their troops in order to get them going.  Each side has a constructed deck of orders cards that is based on what leaders are present - nice.  Battle resolution feels very similar - try to roll hits against the target's symbol, except now we're rolling d8's with 3 green, 2 blue and 1 red result, along with retreat and wild hits.  This means green troops can simply evaporate unless you protect them, etc.  Nice game, and it feels a bit more meaty and intense compared to Battlelore and other games in the series.  It felt much more interesting to play for me.  Fantasy Flight have done a terrific job with the presentation too.  Great stuff.

RATING: 6
First impression: This game improves a lot of my least favorite things about Battlelore.  I especially like that scenarios are now more objective oriented.  It always bugged my in Battlelore that the goal is just to "eliminate X units".

I also really like the use of the 8 sided dice.  This system does a good job of representing the differences between the different ranked units.  Green units are much easier to hit, but also significantly more mobile thanks to the fact that you roll these same dice to generate order tokens.

The major change is that units are now ordered on the basis of their proximity to commanders rather than left/center/right board position.  This is maybe more different than strictly better than the Battlelore system, but it definitely gives the game its own flavor. 

My concern is that BoW is somewhat drier than BL.  I think that BoW will be more tactically interesting, but also lacks the fun elements of lore, command councils, and rampaging monsters!

I am curious to see if one of these games eventually replaces the other for me, but my impression now is that there is room for both of these on my shelf.  BoW certainly feels more like a complement to BL than a clone, much more so than Memoir '44.

UPDATE Aug 2012
After a few plays and some retrospection, I have decided that BoW is an overwrought version of the C&C system.  The FAQ is ridiculous!  Quite to my surprise, I found that the ZOC system is actually more constraining than the usual C&C L-C-R system.  I also find keeping track of all the commander's special abilities a hassle.  I do miss the pizazz of Battlelore's command council and lore cards.  
I appreciate that BoW is a fine game, but BL is more my speed in this genre.

Only played solo - which works since there's no real hidden mechanics or cards. 

Good balance, lots of content, highly replayable. 

Piece quality could be a lot better (base and pegs mainly) but the rest is similar to Tides of Iron quality. I had to glue to pieces to their bases, and inserting the banner poles can be difficult. Knocked points off for this alone. Rest is great.

Get past the fiddly bits and the soft and bloated rules and there is quite a good game here. Yeah, dice still add luck, but NOT solely relying on cards or sections for ordering your troops, and the heavy weight on leaders adds a level of strategy and planning not seen in the C&C games. Make no mistake, though it says "A BattleLore Game" on the box, this is not BattleLore nor a C&C game.

It's like a bit more advanced version of Memoir '44, and I really like that.

The flank and center system from Memoir '44 is gone.
Instead you roll to get order-tokens for different units.
Also, having Heroes that can order units in a zone around them works really well.

Looking forward to play the rest of the scenarios.

Really fun, main gripe is how a group down to 1 of its 4 units can still attack at the same strength as when it had 4.  That is such a glaring oversight/makes no sense. Also feel like the generals should be able to do more than just look cool and bestow abilities to their units.

After playing this and BattleLore, I thought I hated tactical conflict games.  Playing Summoner Wars corrected that thought.  I guess I just really don't like the command and colors system.  I think this is a huge improvement on BattleLore and the theme is very evocative, but unfortunately that's not enough for me.  Spending three hours of gluing mini's to their bases also didn't help my love of the game or any excitement for upcomming expansions if I did turn out to like the game.

RATING: 8
The game plays very similar to Battlelore, although it fixes some of the "problems" with Battlelore, such as sometimes have unusable command cards or having no way to order units if you don't have cards for the correct section.  I really like the commanders and the way that command cards work in a certain radius of the commanders.  That mechanic makes for some excellent tactical opportunities.  Command cards combined with the resource tokens mean that you always have something you can do.  On my first play the game was already set up so I can't say for sure, but I suspect that set-up is just as fiddly and tedious as it is for Battlelore.  I really like playing Battlelore, and this for me - admittedly after only one play - feels like a definite improvement of the Battlelore system.  That, combined with the fact that it is set in Westeros and based on battles from the ASoIaF books makes me want to play the game more, own it, and give it a fairly high rating.

I've said it before that the CnC system is best in a non-historical setting because the ahistorical bits don't jar your enjoyment of the game, and this is borne out here. The card+chit system adds a layer of decision-making without feeling rules-heavy. The rulebook is thick-ish but is not so daunting. The first 10 pages are about components - befitting an FFG game. Lots of options to explore, scenarios look interesting - I'll be playing more of this.

Typical FFG treatment of an otherwise good gaming system. Too many counters and blown up. M44 or Battlecry are much better designed and more streamlined games than BoW. BoW has fiddly and cumbersome mechanics which are against the ease and fun factors which are so typical for other incarnations of the C&C system.

Mostly having too many options (at expense on streamlining) is not a good idea. I found the most games FFG releases today sadly have this screwed design philosophy. After realizing this I decided to sell my whole FFG collection. (God bless ebay)

But the plastic knights are fine. Thats the only plus.

Sort of a command and colors game.  If you played battle cry and got annoyed about the flags falling off and couldn't be bothered to glue them... well your going to hate this game.  Piece come in 4 parts (base/figure/post/flag) and the bases falloff every time you touch them.  Like battle cry this can be resolved w a bit of glue however there are so many piece to glue and it just not worth the effort.  While this game tries to institute cool mechanics such as flanking and unit traits that sound great on paper.  In actual game play they are a bit fiddly and don't really add much.  This is a decent game in its own right but w/ so many command and color style games this ends up on the bottom of the pile.

Urg! Rating this one is tough. After two plays, I have to say that Westeros is definately a step up in complexity from your standard C&C games. The complexity level, and degree of component interaction, has changed the feel of the system quite a bit. 

If your grognard buddies have been reluctant to play C&C games because of their "lightness," then give Westeros a try. The added complexity changes the way the game plays considerably. In fact, at least to me, the game almost feels like a C&C knock-off; a game made by someone else, emulating the play style. It's still driven by cards, but the character's special abilities, and the whole command structure add lots of nuances. 

If you're at all like me, then you'll have to play this one several times before knowing if you like it. My best advice is just to try and forget that it's a C&C game, and go in with an open mind.

Another game using the commands & colors system. I like the twist using the leaders. It works well and feel thematically correct. I really like the theme of the game and the artwork is very good.

Unfortunately the components do not match. The loose bases are a big annoyance and I don't want to have to glue every single one of them. The flags work well mechanically but they are very fiddly.

[i]Nov 2013[/i]: Keeping the 5 rating. Unranked.
[i]Oct 2010[/i]: First Impression: I've got mixed feelings. Really want to like this game but there are more than a few things that kill the fun for me. IMO, it lacks the elegance of the Commands & Colors Ancients rules set.

Rulebook
- A bit muddled, could have been written more clearly
0 Had to refer back to rules a few times, could have used a better quick reference sheet. I'm thankful that there is a Universal Head sheet for this game
- Rules text on cards could have been written more clearly, to help newbies. For example, A leadership card with "Rally all units" really should have been "Rally all units within Leader's Zone of Control" or something like. YMMV.

Time
- Setup takes a good deal longer than most Commands & Colors/Battlelore type games. 1st game took me almost an hour, but this included sorting through the cards, etc. There were a few times that I thought that playing another game would have been a better use of my time.


Theme
+ I loves me some Westeros

Fun Factor
+ One thumb up.

Components:
+ Great looking minis and cards
- A pain to assemble, took a couple of hours to glue, plus a few more to dry
- Banners were a pain to deal with during play
- Aaah. Too MANY tokens! (Well this could be a plus for some... this is a FFG product after all).

I hope that with repeated play
* That game setup and game play time speeds up
* Complexity will translate into "game depth" and a fun game experience as opposed to being a chore

I would probably have liked this better if it wasn't an evolution of Commands & Colors.  As it is, I feel it drops a lot of what I like about C&C and doesn't really add anything that makes up for the increased time it takes to play.

It's not a bad game, but it feels a lot like playing a standard hex and counter wargame, just with better components, and that's not what I look for in a game these days.

[b][i]Battles of Westeros[/i][/b] is a 2 player battlefield game set in Martin's Song of Ice and Fire universe. This game feels strategical; a player is rewarded if they, for example, prudently move archers to a hill and ensure that the fighting occurs nearby. Dice and cards are used, but games are generally won (or lost) because of strategy. Battles are typically short (or at least feel short) and leave players wanting a rematch.

The Ice and Fire theme, while present, is subtle. It's mostly in the names of the units and a few of the leaders' order cards. Instead this game feels much like a real-world medieval battle--very much like the battles in the books. 

There are a lot of tokens and rarely used mechanisms in this game. I would call the game fiddly if I felt any of it out of place. Also, the plastic pieces (while awesome) need some assembly and could really use magnetized trays (as some resourceful geeks have done) for moving them around the battlefield. 

The battlefield genre has been explored in games such as Commands and Colors. In the C&C games, there's a left-center-right mechanism where you play a card that allows mobilization on a certain section of the battlefield. BoW instead uses zones of control where leaders are able to activate friendly units that are near to them. I greatly prefer the BoW implementation. Firstly, having leaders give direct orders to soldiers makes thematic sense to me. Secondly, I enjoy the strategy of placing your leaders in a useful position (to order units) while still protecting them from being eliminated. BoW also allows units to be ordered with tokens, giving you further options.

Now I'd like to brag a little bit. My copy of BoW is signed by George RR Martin, who told me he's never able to win. I agreed with him that, as the author, he should get some kind of advantage. He's super nice.

An evolution of the very successful Commands & Colours system. BoW adds a more flexible command system that allows you to better plan your moves and attacks and largely eliminates the C&C issue of running out of Command cards for a sector and having that part of your army grind to a halt - tea-break time! BoW adds a lot of tactics cards and a very clever flanking mechanic that promotes clever moves and adds another feature of play.

All the bits are outstanding and you get miniatures rather than blocks (if that is important to you). My only negative is that the game is somewhat fiddly with a lot of chits, placing engagement tokens and turning flag counters to indicate activation - it all works but does add some tedium. A good lite wargame.

After two games, first scenario: Wow, this game really feels what Battlelore should have been from the start. The orders and combat system is a good design, letting more tactical and strategic planning without the frustration of bad luck. Now the cards you get are similarily strong (opposite to BL), there are no battle zones (left, middle, right), what is really good, you cannot order one unit n times in a row, and combat seems less random and more thematical.The games feels more euroish than BL and gives you much more satisfaction, without frustration.

The game is very good wargame (it's a game about war, so it's a wargame in my book). Unfortunately the Westeros setting is very thin. Yes, the characters are from the "Song of Ice and Fire", but any relation with the story ends here.

Setup is a bit boring, and the best way to play this game is to have a place where can have it always setup and adjust to the scenario you want and start playing.

Good evolution of the C&C system. It does, however, lose some of the systems simple elegance. Much more granular experience. Combat is brutal. Components are sturdy. Rules are a mess to comprehend at times. The minis are meh...

I'm a huge fan of C&C: Ancients, so this appealed to me...some.  I've read a couple of the books, and while I'm not enamored with the theme, the "history" helps.

The game itself?  Great fun.  Lots of decisions to make each turn and the system gives adequate rewards/punishment for good/bad play.

RATING: 7
I rated this game a 7, even though I think the gameplay itself rates a solid 9. Top-tier stuff, TONS of fun...when it reaches the table. It's got a lot of knocks against it out of the gate (for my play group):

1) 2 players only
2) Long setup, even if you have an organizing system in place and all the pieces glued into their bases
3) Lots of concepts to teach

So 2 players is hard to fire up for big groups, and the setup is rather onerous. The components could help themselves more, too. You have to put flagpoles into figure bases, and much of the time these just won't fit very easily!

All that said, when you get into playing it, it's a freaking blast. My wife and I have had a lot of fun maneuvering around the battlefield. The dice rolling to grab tokens for activation is very cool, and feels a little more in my control than, say, Memoir 44, a very similar battle system for a game I also enjoy.

If you REALLY like the setting and the stories, this is worth the extra trouble, in my opinion. If you don't give a hoot about A Song of Ice and Fire but want a 2 player skirmish game, you might jump for Memoir 44 instead, which has streamlined rules and much, much faster setup.

I still recommend this though!

With a few plays under my belt, here's a few notes:

1. The rules, packaging, and overall components are top notch. Beautiful art, quality printing, great rules/battle layout, well-defined minis.

2. As so many others have noted, plan to spend a couple of hours beforehand dealing with basic unit setup. Make sure you have glue, spare newsprint, and a hobby/paring knife nearby. I personally enjoy that sort of detail work, but it may be daunting for others.

3. The gameplay is smooth, very quick for the number of units involved, and keeps all players engaged. Even though there are only two factions, this can easily handle two teams and give everyone something to do between flag turning, tactics planning, unit movement, & taunting the other team!

3. The thought of painting 138 minis is pretty daunting, but the figures are high detail and well modelled, and finish very nicely using standard acrylic drybrush techniques.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was really excited when I got this one from my really generous Secret Santa but after two initial plays I'm not sure (yet) if I really like this better than BattleLore or Memoir '44.  The leader and command token system definitely plays different and adds an interesting new twist to the entire system.  On the other hand, the game is more fiddly as players alternately activate single units (or groups of units). Finally the quality of the components is disappointing: the cards bend heavily and the figures lack precision: many do not fit into their bases and the definitely do not hold without glueing them to the bases.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An overly complicated "Battlelore", with less luck in the cards but a lot more in the dice. The idea of having commanders on the battlefield and using them to activate units is very nice, but maybe they are too hard to defeat. And nothing else can be called an improvement.

The number of special powers - in commanders, units and leadership cards - is excessive, and made worse by the lack of icons. Having to read and re-read lots of text on cards every turn is not fun. Turning flags every time a unit is activated is annoying, even more because the colors mean the same for both players. So, if white means an already activated unit this round, I'm actually seeing the black side of the flags of my opponent's activated units, which causes confusion.

On the production, it is inexcusable that the miniatures have to be put on their bases - and "put" means "glued", as the plastic is too soft and they will not stay in place otherwise.

I like the "Game of Thrones" theme, but the only thing that could remind me of it in the gameplay is that the Starks have wolves (which are absent in the first scenario). The implementation would have to be much more immersive to make me want to play this instead of "Battlelore".

I like some of its elaborations on the basic C&C ideas, but overall I don't like some of the more difficult to apply rules (engagement, for one). I also prefer the hand management introduced by section cards as opposed to the logistical issue of keeping your units in command. All in all, I prefer the C&C system.
Thematic integration is also not great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
NOT a C&C game regardless of the branding. You cannot transform the key mechanic at the heart of a game-system (i.e. C&C's Command Cards), and still identify it as part of that system. I can only hope FFG was attempting to take the "high road" by labeling BoW a BattleLore game.

As a BattleLore fan, am torn about rating this game. In many ways I feel the Leaders/zone-of-control/order chits mechanisms are an improvement on the C&C system. On the other hand, something is simply lost. The 8-sided dice improve the defensive variables between red and green units, but the delicate forces governing casualties are tampered with.

I care nothing for the theme (having found GRRM's series underwhelming). BoW will certainly not replace BattleLore. Nevertheless, on its own merit, BoW has many things to recommend it.

I haven't visited the Command & Colors system since Battle Cry, not because I didn't enjoy that game, but because I never really felt much need to play any of its variants. Eleven years later, I was finally tempted by the chance to skin some direwolves for the glory of House Lannister. I'd say the system is slightly marred by the added complication here, but it's still quite playable. The flanking rules add an interesting (if chromey) wrinkle, but I'm not yet convinced the morale or initiative rules add anything especially worthwhile. Familiarity with the various special rules and abilities will certainly help get the playing time down, which will be important if this is to see much play. I'm a bit concerned that the huge impact of generals (with their limited command range) and the "stalwart" defensive formations could mean that you'll always want to keep your armies in clumps and turtle up. If the game rewards slow defensive play to any great extent, it could be an issue, since a C&C game really ought to be as short and quick moving as possible. Westeros gets an extra point for its tried and true system and because I like the theme/setting, but the jury's still out on the long term playability of this one. One last thing: Don't even play until you've glued the figures to their bases. Moving those things around otherwise is just an exercise in futility.

For Casterly Rock!

I hope "Winter is Coming" soon because this is a great game to break out when you have a ton of free time on your hands. And what better time than a cold winter in Tokyo. 
Of course, as a fan of the TV series, it makes you feel like you're engaged in the epic conflicts of Westeros. But not only that, the range of gameplay options, from king of the hill and skirmishes to area control and sieges, gives an amazing amount of replay value. 
While set-up can take over 30 minutes at times, each game usually only lasts for an hour so I love to fit in at least two matches at a time. 
Success of a well thought-out strategy relies more heavily on dice than I would usually like, but moment to moment it is still a blast to play. There is always a ton of fun banter during each roll. 
Check it out if you like any Fantasy battle games or Game of Thrones itself, and don't mind a long set-up. (^_^)

I got this game because I had played Memoir 44 and liked it. This game is on a whole nother level from Memoir 44. I'm sure it's a good game if you like medieval wargames. I however don't think that I do.

BY FAR the biggest dissapointment for me with this game was the production. The fact that you had to pop all of the figures into bases was bad enough but then add that the plastic for the figures is very soft and it is very hard to get them into the bases and finally they just fall out. Beyond that the flag system seems fiddly. Anyways, Fantasy Flight should be ashamed of the production.

I love the grand strategy and pieces. Better the second or third time around as you can plan more accordingly.

My roommate and I love this game. The only problem we have gleaned from playing this game around 50+ times is the constant need to reference the FAQ and addendum. After game 5 or 6 we ended up printing out the complete rulebook again with all the rule changes, faqs, and addenda rules.

Overall, this is my favorite 2 player game! If you get someone to play this with you for the long haul, a campaign is really worth it.

I think that our score is 19-13 with my roommate in the lead. He usually plays Stark and I play Lannister, and we switch off playing Baratheon against each others respective house.

BoW feels like a revamped version of Battle Lore mixed with a twist of ToI to boot. Its scenario-based skirmishes feel very thematic (ala FF), and very intense. Although the game has a considerable amount of key words to remember, repetitive plays will help players cope, and the awesome gameplay will make it worthwhile.

RATING: 8.2
Initial play, the game is solid.  Great theme for GOT lovers.  I don't like that your unit is usually comprised of 4 class members of a certain rank, which determines your strength.  However, as your unit members die then so should your effective strength but that is not the case.  If you roll 4 dice then you will roll 4 dice on an attack until the entire unit is dismantled.  

Other than that, it is a fairly descent strategy game because movement and real estate placement can make a big difference as to how your attacks affect your play.  Time setup a bit long.  All in all, a nice one and I'm looking forward to some expansions.

This is a great system, and it keeps getting better the more I play. Much more involved than other Commands n Colors games, but thats what makes this version stand out in a crowd of great great games in the system. I love BattleLore 1 and especially 2 as well as Memoir 44, but Westeros is much more of its own beast. More strategic, more battlefield realism with zones of control (with the engagement mechanism) and the importance of leaders. Scenarios are longer, but very tense throughout. Too bad it wasn't more popular, so it could have been supported with more factions (Martell, Bolton, Dothraki/Targaryan and Geryjoy).

RATING: 6
A 6 is perhaps a bit harsh of a score for this game, which does some things I do like, but what it comes down to is that if I have the choice of a Command & Colors-style game, I will pick Battlelore: 2nd Edition over Battles of Westeros every time.

I'm a big ASOIAF fan, and that kept me invested for the first few plays, but ultimately the license and theme can't quite, to my mind, overcome the fiddliness of the mechanics and the way that the balance of fun to stress tips pretty heavily to the stress side. 

In the end, I just don't have fun playing Battles of Westeros. I do very much like the commander system, but that is really the only thing this game has over the new Battlelore—and even that doesn't really hurt for lack of one.

If you are a fan of the license and of Command & Color games in general, BoW could be worth it to you, but it will be very much a matter of personal taste, and I would very strongly recommend that you find a way to play it a few times before buying it.

Dropping the stupid L\C\R (which had about as much strategic depth as a game of the same name.....) system from previous games for the Commanders was a HUGE improvement.  That and other added details like flanking and engagement tokens make this the "light wargame" that I always wanted other C&C games to be (but that they always fell miserably short at).  I am not even much of a AGoT fan, but I love this game for gritty medieval combat in a war game.

Do note that I've only played a couple of the previous "C&C" games, including Memoir '44 and at least one or two others (can't remember which right now), but definitely not all of them.  This is certainly my favorite of any I have played though.

Even though it seems like it isn't as well-balanced as I at first thought, I'm still loving this game. It really is a very different game than Battlelore, although more similar to that game than any other Commands and Colors games.  The minis are nice and I think the flag turning system works well to support this new way of ordering units.  Having objective based scenarios makes it a much more interesting experience than simply tracking numbers of units eliminated, with the opportunity to lose nearly your entire army just to secure that objective and win.
*Edit* Now with the new downloadable "enhanced" rules, balance seems to have returned and the game is brimming with tactical potential.  It's still a bear to set up, especially with the included patented FFG no-frills organizational system, but the game is worth it and rewards multiple plays, which will improve setup to play time ratios.  
**Edit** I now have eliminated the command tokens altogether in order to streamline hand management.  The command limit now refers to the number of orders on an order card that a commander can utilize, not the actual number of cards per round, which is already limited enough by activations.  I have also posted a thread discussing these changes.  
***Edit***
Back to the official rules and all official Optional Rules.  The game is great and getting greater with expansions.

I find the mechanic is more intuitive than Command & Colors. Also, there is a little less luck involved with which command cards you have. Still somehow Command & Colors is closer to my hart (i suspect I prefer Euro style to Ameritrash in general and as such I might simply like the wooden cubes better.)

The theme made it a little hard to sell gamers on it, however with the TV series out it might be easier to find willing game partners.

I actually like what they did here to "fix" complaints about the Command & Colors system.  In many ways Battles of Westeros is a superior game system (if only in theory).  It's just that its still too close to those other games and thematically, while I am a huge Game of Thrones fan, it is just hard to beat the fantasy appeal that creature additions have in a game like Battlelore or all the machinery of something like Memoir.  It kind of lends itself to situations then where those who would consider playing Battles of Westeros already play those other two instead.  And those that don't do not really have interest in trying something that appears very similar, if only on the surface.  For me I never really had a problem with the C&C elements Battles of Westeros sought out to fix and as such both mechanically and thematically I prefer those other games.

I love the controll-zone mechanic with the commander and the importance of them and that units work better togheter. 
You always need to protect your flank and an all front assault never pays off. 

GREAT GAME!5/7

Adds a lot of complexity to the basic 'commands & colours' framework.

Not sure yet if that is a good thing or not. 

also, sticking all the units together is probably the single most annoying game related activity i have had to do. but i guess now it's done... (with the possible excpetion of playing 'Bushido'...)

I have only played this a few times so far but every bit as enjoyable as Borg's other games. A bit deeper than the others but still great fun. All but the newest expansion figures painted with wash only technique. Includes Brotherhood Without Banners, House of Baratheon, Lords of the River, Tribes of the Vale, Wardens of the North,and Wardens of the West expansions.

RATING: 8
Battle Lore game system done away with the left-center-right wing system.  Instead card deck based on leaders are introduced.  While I am waiting for reprint of the original Battlelore, this could satisfy me the struggle between the two direct confrontational houses of Lennister and Stark - at least for the time being.  

Despite the rules have some minor contradictions, vagueness which require further errata or clarifications to clear up, the overall game gives the players a full sense of richness, details about the tactics employed in the world of Westeros, and some very well-designed, tightly balanced scenarios which set the stage of the battles as told by the novels themselves.  A highly recommended item to those fan of the series, and who want to be immersed in the medieval battles, nature of which characterized by leadership attributes, command group, stalwart counterattacks, combined arms like archers and cavaliers, etc.  Many fine points in the system.  It reminds me of why I want to get into wargaming in the first place - the wanting to know why things happen that way and a believable model to calculate or project results.  

The rules also come with a system of randomly generated scenario called "Skirmish", which would give unlimited number of settings of games to the players.  The players can write up the story of the battles themselves. It obviously adds a lot of value of money to the game.

I only played it once yet, but I just love it. And not only, because it was the first strategy-based game I ever won against my bf. :) 
I also very much enjoyed the mechanics, which at first I found very complicated - but which I grew into halfway through the battle. The command-cards are such an elegant idea, there are so many differents things you can decide to do on your turn. Biggest thumb-up for this game is the thick atmosphere. For a fan of the novels like me it's really capturing, because the game-mechanics manage to really reflect the stories! Especially the commanders and their card-decks create a shitload of immersion. I was not only shoving around a little plastic figure, rolling dice, no - in that moment I WAS Maege Mormont, Lady of the Bear Island, holding the river against the Lannisters attack, fighting until the last man to give the Karstark troops a chance to stand their ground at the ford. For Eddard, for Winterfell!

Awesome game. Can't wait to play again.

RATING: 8.5
Great take on Borg's Command and Colors system but without the "centre/left flank/right flank" mechanic. Great use of leaders plus leader-specific cards.  Adds morale and flanking advantages to the usual C&C system.  Overall I think this is the best game of the bunch.  Love the theme too.

RATING: 6.5
Originally rated 8. In my original impression I really liked some of the mechanisms and how they tied to the theme. I blamed the fiddly feeling on the group I played with.

Playing again after a few years and after having played a lot of Battlelore Second Edition has me concluding that the fiddliness is an unfortunate part of the game. Sadly the card art is incredible. I will miss that.

not quite as good as battlelore.  the red units are powerhouses, and the green units are even worse than in battlelore.  i like several of the ideas:  flanking, leader influence, certain keyword abilities, but they dont quite come together elegantly and smoothly as you would hope.

Apart from the transition of Battlelore’s fantasy Europe to the lands of Westeros, the biggest change is the order system. And it is a rather well-done transition, with a good mix of order tokens (purely random and visible to your opponent) and command cards (not quite as random, hidden and partially dependent on your commanders in the field). The fluid Battlelore structure of playing a single card round after round is replaced by a less elegant round structure, but the tactical landscape is very much enriched by having to work with all of your units and, especially, deciding on when and how to use the precious few opportunities when a unit can act twice in a round.

The switch from six-sided to eight-sided combat dice is a nice touch, particularly because it introduces more subtle effects than simply boosting red troops: since you also use the dice to determine your order tokens for the round, heavy (red) troops might now be a lot harder to kill, but they are also very hard to activate in the absence of a commander.

What mars the game and will probably prevent me from buying it is that FFG apparently does not put enough trust into this very well-done system to let it stand on its own. Even the base game is tricked out with lots and lots of little rule additions and exceptions for this unit or that commander, and this state of affairs is not helped by the flood of expansions. This is somewhat strange to me, because the decision space provided by the basic engine itself with some troop variations and, perhaps, different battlegrounds, was ample enough without piling on special abilities of commanders, troops and what have you.

See my detailed review of the game.  *EDIT* As long as FFG doesn't release a new version of the rulebook, I'll have to drop this game's rating to a 6.  The FAQ and Errata document is one of the largest ever (Even by FFG's standards) and the new rules they added, both optional and mandatory, apparently only add to the mess.  Can't help but think the game wasn't given the attention it deserved and it's a shame.  Maybe the TV show will bring the focus back to it.

A fantastic addition to the C&C series.  I very much appreciate the dropping of the Left-Center-Right cards, and feel this game grants the players much more control than earlier games in the series.  Prior to BoW, I had played too many games of Battlelore where the right card was not drawn the entire game, and that was enough of that game for me!

Would be a "9" in my book, wasn't it for some fiddliness (which actually is not nearly as bad as some early testers claim). Luck plays a much smaller role than in classic Battlelore (if played according to the rules - some BL veterans just skimmed through the rulebook and missed some basic rules totally!), the sculpts have the same detail as Battlelore, but are realistic (though not to scale, which I do not see as a problem). 
If the flag poles are put throughly(!) into the figure bases, the banner turning is just easy and works perfectly (take up the figure, turn the banner, place it back on the game board).

The fiddlyness? Mostly the same as I saw in BL: a bridge or ford marker on a hex terrain makes manipulation of a full unit fiddly. The engagement markers found in BOW are  a pain, but very effective for gameplay. As far as I know, many figures have to be glued in their bases (the copy I own had almost all pre-glued by someone, 20 were unglued and fit good. But I have no idea about the other 118.
The cardboard of the banners is really good. I have no fear of wearing these soon. But make sure to insert a banner ONCE in a flagpole and never take it out again.
 
Thematically I thought (at first impulse): what's the point? The Song Of Ice And Fire is not about battles, were there any in the books? But when I reread passages of the books, I found several battles which were the exact scenarios described in BOW. Granted, some are mere footnotes, but described with enough detail that they won't feel generic at all.

The first scenario seems to be perfectly balanced.

The second one - hm, I'm not that sure, the experience (played it once as Lannister and won) was a mixed bag.

The third one is great again. Lost incredibly high as Lannister, but I see what I will do differently next time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Similar to Command and Colors but I liked it more because there is no right, center,left cards.  You chose the unit to play with cards with the aid of your leaders and you have some liberty with tokens each turn.

Great implementation of the "Lore" series with less luck and more decision making in the process.

Good job FFG...

A definite improvement on BattleLore, but how much, I'm not sure. The command system is very interesting and the designer has gotten rid of the flanks and center designations, which is good. However, some of the innovations are a bit fiddly and I'm not sure how well they work. It seems to me after one play that a player can get hosed by his initiative dice roll, and I'm suspicious how unbalanced having Rally All cards and Blue Toughness 1 Cavalry will be.  But there's enough innovation here that I look forward to me next plays, especially since my one play came down to the last die roll.

Caveat emptor: the figs MUST be glued in their stands in order to play. There is no maybe. What a flub from bits king FFG!

After reading the prepublication Rules of Battles of Westeros i had to say: Bye, Bye CCA and Battlelore. Battles of Westeros seems to catch the deficiencies of both: Flanking, Engagement, Army specific card decks, more control over movement and some minor points (more independent skirmishers, while heavies rely on concerted actions etc.).
***********
Update: Great game in a medieval setting, also acceptable for the non-fantasy crowd. We will see if FFG runs too much amok with ever more weird expansions and unit capabilities and distracts from realism.

If you like Memoir'44, but need a little bit more depth, this is definitively the game for you. The concept of Zone-of-Control (ZOC) in Battles of Westeros is much more interesting and add deeper level of strategy than the Left-Center-Right Flank in Memoir'44. 

Once again, if you like Memoir'44 so much, and craving for a deeper level of strategy, then Battles of Westeros is the game for you! Go, Quick! Grab A Copy! :)

A very fine game that can collapse under its own weight and production value. Lots of back and forth, and the C&C battle with the best narratives that I have played. Watching a cavalry unit sweep across the battlefield is truly epic. Flanking rules and the BattleLore order system are put to good effect.

But it takes so long to assemble, set up, play, and put away, that I wonder if I'm better off just playing Ancients when I get the C&C itch. So many tokens and bits and bobs that it doesn't really need. The morale system is tacked on and kind of stupid.

The requirement to keep units within range of your commander(s) in order to do multiple move/attacks on a turn must be kept in mind throughout, and this does away with the three zone structure. The engagement / parting blow / flanking rules allow pinning of troops, which can waylay plans effectively. There's more luck involved in what you can move each turn (as set by dice rolls and a card draw, with a smaller hand size), but hits are harder to come by so battles tend to go longer before there's death involved. There's a round based structure meaning units only get to act once (usually) each round, as opposed to the fluidity of repeatable Memoir troop movement. On the downside, setup takes longer and the components are damn fiddly enough to turn off all but the hardiest of system / theme lovers - fiddling with units not sticking in bases and the continual rotation of banners creates a frustrating sense of slowness which is out of keeping with what's meant to be a frenetic melee battle scene. As such, I'd choose Memoir '44 over this just for better thematic immersion, easier setup, and the faster pace of play. Still, this has a big plus in how all the different troop and commander effects can give different feels to different battles, which is in contrast to the same-ness of Memoir battles where terrain dictates activity. Not sure there's a need for both in the collection, but happy to explore further for a while.

Interesting new ideas but the scenarios aren't always fun.  There's somthing tedious about the new mechanics that I cna't put my finger on.  I really don't like the way leaders are handled, that is for sure.  Many of the scenarios end up being "war of the clumps" due to radius of command, and, the end game often features leaders who can't harm each other dueling for a key hex.  Not sure if that is dramatic or jus tsilly.

The experience was ok, as all of the FFG's newer games. There was nothing especially cool to be thrilled about and the scenario design felt a bit flawed. The most annoying part of Battlelore hasn't been changed: the cumbersome setup. 

There were many innovations to make the game better and less luck-driven as B-lore was, but still, this type of game should be a little more faster (or easier to setup). Also I'm a bit sceptic about the flow of expansions. Why not make few really good expansions instead of more of this same? I'm a bit worried about the direction FFG is taking with their games, hopefully I'm wrong...

All in all, this is definitely better than Battlelore, but also slightly harder to understand also. I'd still recommend this instead of B-lore or Memoir...

We played it twice so far,the first time we were playing it wrong,so I guess you can say we had a one time play through.
You must glue the peice's,so if you plan on playing saturday take a couple of hour's friday to get the gluing done.
There is a lot to learn here,that being said if you take the time to learn and read some rule's forum the game is pretty good.
I really enjoyed the theme of the game,the big board and all the mini's,The game play was pretty fun too.
I seen a lot more strategy here then from other game's of this category. Overall I liked the game,gluing is a pain, set up time is some what long,and there are plenty of rules,but nothing very hard to learn just a lot.

RATING: 9
C&C:Ancients is solidly in my top 5 games, so I can't help comparing BoW to that game, even though they are quite different, enough so that I'm happy to own both.

BoW has a big variation in scenarios. You're not just trying to kill troops and avoid getting your troops killed, you're attacking or defending specific points, or units, and you have limited time to do so. That means you won't really make those big, strong army lines like in C&C:A, but have different groups of units with specific tasks. This makes battles play out very differently.

It helps if you're familiar with the A Song of Ice and Fire books or Game of Thrones tv series, because the characters play an important part. Leaders are very powerful fighters, hugely important for issuing command, on the one hand very hard to capture (the 'optional rules' counter that a bit) but on the other enormous targets since a leader loss is devastating. In C&C:A leaders give important bonuses, bit in BoW the fight really revolves around them.

The biggest difference between C&C:A en BoW however, is that in BoW you have rounds. Every round each unit can usually only act once, and you often have enough command to order almost all of them. This means it's quite close to more traditional games where you simply move each unit until you've moved them all. Playing cards is less about which units act, than about how and when those units act.

This last bit is the main point why I think C&C:A is the better game. I understand some people don't like the restrictive nature of the left/center/right card system of C&C:A. But I don't think BoW gives more freedom or open-ended plays; quite the opposite, in fact. In C&C:A you never know what cards the opponent holds and where he will move next. Does he have more left flank cards? Is he setting up for a devastating line command or mounted charge? Whereas in BoW you know that if he just moved Kevan and his infantry, his next order is likely Marbrand and the cavalry.

Another point against BoW is that I feel dice rolls are more important and swingy. In C&C:A if you have a strong line with leaders at the right points and cavalry to shore up any weaknesses and you roll miserably, you still have that line and those leaders and the cavalry. In BoW you're more likely to send in a single leader or other unit against an ill-defended unit of the opponent, and then the difference between two flags, two hits or all misses is huge. You can sometimes even point to that one time where you had two turns and 10 dice to roll a single flag to win the game, but you didn't and you lost. Or you took some risks turn 1 and your opponent rolled amazingly and the battle was pretty much over before it started. In C&C:A there's more randomness in the cards, but I like that, since those cards are known before you make your moves, and the result of die rolls aren't.

BoW is also more fiddly. Terrain rules aren't always intuitive, lots of scenarios come with their own rules and then there's the errata and optional rules. Much of it is needed, though. It's simply less abstract than the battle line vs. battle line of C&C:A, and that means more rules. But you will need to look up how counterattacking from a ford or pursuit across a wooden bridge works or how quickly a forest burns. Or figure out what exactly happens if you make a coordinated attack with two units against cavalry that gained the stalwart keyword, when both are flanking, one is infantry below half strength in a forest and the other is cavalry engaged with Addam Marbrand. And then there's the time it takes to sort all those counters and units and flags and terrain tiles... it takes a while before you can start to play.

That said, there's a lot I do like about BoW. Most scenarios are great and look nice with all the little scenario-specific tokens and rules. The d8 instead of d6 is awesome - light units are easier ordered when sent out by themselves, but heavy units are harder to hit. Units are more varied, leaders are more varied and have each their own feel, and I like using different cards in different setups. And I'm looking forward to painting the little plastic soldiers. Although I don't think the gameplay is as good as in C&C:A, I can certainly see myself often choosing BoW over it; mostly because of the greater variation and less abstraction.

Wasn't that impressed after one play.  The battle system is not bad and the components are good, but the set up time is long (Tide of Iron long) and the game is not that fast.

Really enjoyed the first two plays. Leaders and dice rolls to determine unit orders vice cards for left/center/right flanks make this the best of the C&C series mechanically. Using d8 with three green/light, two blue/medium, and one red/heavy makes armored units much more dangerous and resiliant (dice also have the fist--think C&C sword or M44 grenade--and a retreat flag). Prefer the historical themed games over Westeros setting.

What to say? Want to like, still need to decide.

Bad things - rules, typical FFG rubbish. Badly organised, hunting around to find crucial info. The problem as if often the way, is that stuff is not properly defined or mentioned. What is actually a simple turn sequence is rendered a mystery by the wording. Still, as a derivation of Borg's C&C system it is worthy, and the fan rewrite seems to help.

Worse however, are the plastic models. Small, rubbish to use, and frankly a let down.

Okay, what about the game?

Well, I think despite all the above, I might like it. Based on one play, it is fun, engaging and tense, with decisions at every turn. It is just that setting it up, sorting through the myriad of pieces and getting cards set up cuts into the gaming time. Hence the rating of 6 only.

I'm really torn about this one. Core set offers fun (if not balanced) battles between Starks and Lannisters but the added rule complexity over Battlelore doesn't result in an equivalent game play improvement. You will likely house rule some simplifications like many others have added here. Expansions offer more scenarios but also more rules and even if you get them all you still won't get to play with Boltons, Targaryens, Nights Watch, Wildlings, etc. I'd recommend getting it and combining it with Battlelore 1st edition to get cross-over value between both games.
Update 12Nov2017: Sadly this game lacks the fun factor of Battlelore and just isn't getting played. While the rule changes seem like an improvement in theory (e.g. the 8-sided dice) the actual games don't flow like the original BL and I can't convince anyone to play it again. So it's been cannibalised to chrome up my other games to make use of those beautiful minis, board and counters.

Another ASOIAF thematic game by FFG. This time they apply the BattleLore mechanic onto the conflict between House Stark and House Lannister. Despite a dieheart fan of the novel, I'm not very impressed by this piece because the background story for the battle is not strong enough. ASOIAF is not all about battle, and many heroic figures in the game, to name one, the insanely unbeatable Rickard Karstark, do not even play a big role in the novel. I feel they need to apply more related to the book other than plainly 'add' the background onto a fixed-set of mechanic. Anyhow I like the die-roll and treat it like an okay-dokay fun game.

I'm a huge fan of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire novels, so when this game was announced in early 2010 I knew I had to have it (especially since it was marketed as 'A Battlelore Game' and I thought it would have similar mechanics to my all-time favourite Memoir '44).
Without wanting to join the crowds of BoW-bashing Battlelore fans, I do think it was a lame move on FFG's part to brand this as 'A Battlelore Game' since it is not. BoW was certainly inspired by Battlelore, and follows the same basic principles like Bold/Stalwart and different banner colors with different hit capabilities, but it does other things with these units. Replacing the Left-Center-Right principle from C&C by Commanders with zones of control does place the player more in control over which commands he gives to which troops. Lose one of your commanders as a casualty however, and you'll be severely limited in the number of command cards you can play during your turn.
This game has a lot more special rules (almost every unit has a special rule of its own as do the scenario's), which makes it a bit more 'mentally demanding' of the players. This ensures however, that it's not a 'collect the banners'-game like Battlelore. Your battered troops can still snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by achieving their objectives.
The added complexity and setup time make this game take longer than a true C&C game. Sir Hydas and I used to play 1 scenario from the scenario book and 1 randomly set-up scenario in the same timespan it takes us to play 3 to 4 different scenario's in a Memoir '44 Campaign.
The inclusion of a random deployment system out-of-the-box (as opposed to Battlelore, where you have to buy 'Call to Arms' seperately) gives this game an infinite replayability.

I am not really a fan of the genre, but I like the mechanics behind it and it's my go-to dice-rolling game of toy soldiers. I like that it has scenarios, but there's definitely not enough of them, and some seem seriously imbalanced to me. There's not a lot of strategy in it and the choices are often between equivalent options, I didn't even once feel I executed a brilliant, game changing manoeuvre. Because of high randomness, with limited experience it's very hard to predict the consequences of one's actions.  The mechanic of engagement which binds enemy forces together is thematic, but leads to quite static games after your armies close in on each other. You move some soldiers, roll some dice and apply the result. That's it.

The best thing about this game is the fond memories of playing through the base game scenarios with my friend Dennis in Denmark. His constant fake whining ("I don't see how I can win this scenario.") drove me nuts. In a good way. Would be nice to play this more but the game suffers from bloat and clunkiness, FFG style, and the scenarios take too many liberties with the source material. The rulebook is simply awful.

Comment 6/27/'17: I don't understand how this game got a bad reputation, it is infinitely superior to all of the L-C-R "C&C" games.  Really too bad, I just love the heck out of this game!  {original comments ca 2012} Played 1 game solitaire, really fun, really different from all the other "BattleLore" and "C&C" series games in a very good way!  This is a very interesting game, unlike the other tactical level games in this series (which sadly I must now say I despise), it is likely that a player will be able to move all, or almost all, of their units every round.  This is far superior to C&C:A, C&C:N, BL, Mem'44, etc.; but what is even better in comparison is that most of the time all units move only once per round, instead of a small number of units doing all the moving, attacking, etc. (which is one of the many more deplorable features of the "C&C's").  The banner system is genius.  Have played a second game solitaire.  Finally got a live game in, was very good, had the counterattack rule wrong...other than that, great game.

Have played two more times now FtF, won both the 1st scenario as House Stark, and the 3rd Scenario as House Stark, my opponents were each first-time players though.

Truly excellent tactical-level wargame so far, can't wait to play more!

Played the variant 2v2 Skirmish, 4p game (well 3 actually since we had one "no show")...was excellent, quite fun!

Played Scenario #4, base game, solitaire, good scenario, good battle...hard for Lannister to move all those Red Rank units though!

Sat 02/02/2013 - have played 4 times solitaire, 4 scenarios 1v1, and 2 games of 2v2 Skirmish...all excellent!

Fri 01/24/2014 - played today, Scenario #5, and also played this same scenario back in Nov'13. Won both times as Stark though the 1st game, we had to quit early, beginning round 4, and Lannister certainly looked poised for a likely and strong come-back.

Record now: 31-10
Have played all the the scenarios in the base/CORE game except #6 "Wolf Raiders" and #8 "Breaking the Siege." 

Comment 10/3/'15: the best battles/scenarios for teaching and playing for new players, since they are very balanced are: Base #2, Base #7, Base #10.

Rulebooks says it's 'inspired' by Borg's system. That's the extent of it. The reality is that the elegant smooth gameplay of Richard Borg's system has been bogged down by typical FFG chrome. Too many bits and fiddly cards.

Ironically the system of command tokens and cards (played by leaders) seem to have been implemented to mitigate the 'luck' of card draw. But all it adds is needless chrome and extra choices. The game ends up being bogged down in 'euro' style decision trees. Sadly, the decision tree in itself doesn't have many branches. And luck is mitigrated as tokens are gathered by die rolling.

The box says 'Battles of Westeros' but apart from the graphics and use of names of characters from the book, the package is bereft of theme! The cards should have flavour text and titles for example.

And did FFG skimp on production for the plastic figures? Wanna buy this game? Expect to spend an extra few dollars and at least an hour glueing figures onto bases. If DoW/FFG can affix the Battlelore figures, why can't they do it for this one?

Anyway. It's not a terrible game but I'd rather play CC: Ancients or Memoir 44 or even Battlelore!

1.4.2015: slight uptick in rating to 8.87 from 8.75. played the Biting the Hand "epic" scenario w/ extra parts from BattleLore to proxy the necessary pieces.

this game takes tons, tons, & tons of work! but it's sooo worth it! swear, just setting up this scenario took 2 nights, and 2 more nights to clean it back up. and it was a total blast in the 2.5 nights playing in between.

the setup/breakdown time still makes me hesitant to break a 9 rating. honestly, though, this game should be approached as a real, legit miniatures game; a lifestyle game that needs its own paint/craft schedule, storage, and unit-basing. if i ever make it over that hump (and w/ a house-rule for simultaneous close combat) this could be a mid- to high-9 rating.  

4.1.2012: Updated rating, 8.75 from 8.25. After getting a couple new games on the table, BoW just kept calling me to play. I've been considering its FFG cousin Tide of Iron and wondered if BoW's long setup time and multitude of bits (traits shared with ToI) still seemed worth it. The answer? A triumphant "yes!"

Maybe I'm a just a sucker for miniatures. BoW is swirling, chaotic fun.
 
Some other thoughts:
  
I should also update an earlier comparison with C&C: BoW has no business being associated with C&C (via BattleLore). The only meaningful trait the systems share is combat resolution. But even that is a stretch. The more I play both C&C:A and BoW, the more I'm convinced BoW better delivers its theme. With BoW, I'm down in there in the action. With C&C:A, the zoom-in stops at the card table.  

...

2.15.2012: I had initially given this a 6 and was really disappointed while going through the motions of the first scenario. The extensive(!) set-up time and high-maintenance(!!) minis didn't seem worth it. 

I feared this was going to wind up as a contributor to the spare-parts bin (for the well-sculpted minis and quality counters). 

But there's a dark joy and engrossing gaming-magic that happens as scenarios play out.

WOW!! Game of Thrones meets Richard Borg's ingenious mechanics!! What could go wrong?? Well trying to tweak those ingenious mechanics to the point where they are virtually unrecognizable. This is most definitely  the one theme that I would have loved most, but for some unknown reason they had to change the system.

RATING: 8
In many ways BoW developes Battlelore in the right direction. The scenario based victory conditions, 8-sided dice, heavy armor, flanking and leader-centered orders are all really nice improvements. The fact that some leaders are nearly indestructible in some scenarios on the other hand is not good at all. The feature I most dislike is the kennelmaster unit, what a brainfart!

And the components.. what has happened FFG? The quality of components has gone down, but the price of your games have risen quite substantially. What you get for the money is nothing to be ecstatic about. The "new" flags I really dislike. Especially when you have to pay to get the traditional BL flags. The figures are lower quality than in Battlelore. I can live with it, but am not happy about it. At least it is not a unnecessary "coffin" sized gamebox full of air like we have seen in the past.

In the end I prefer Battlelore just a tad over BoW. The simplicity is the winner this time. Love the theme of Song of Ice and Fire of course!

Although I liked this game, I was so annoyed by the long setup time and those stupid flagpoles that I ultimately got rid of it. This game is the pinnacle of FFG fiddliness. It also has nothing to do with the "A Song of Ice and Fire" universe of George R.R. Martin, except for a few names and fancy pictures. And don't get me started on scenario balance.

Battlelore Second Edition is a much better game.

I really like BattleLore, but it has to be even better in the A Song of Ice and Fire setting!
My first few plays have not let me down. The commanders truly are an improvement over the left-centre-right gameplay of Battlelore. The 8-sided die with different probability for different ranks has changed the game a lot for the better, as well. I also like the scenario specific victory conditions.

Traded it for Twilight Struggle.

RATING: 10
Terrific BoardGame! Just emotions remain. Order tokens, command tokens, forming own leadership decks, crash the sections (flanks) mechanic - this is more like an elegant implementation of the Tide of Iron and C & C: A mechanics. Dices are 8-sided and executed in the style of C & C, but more interesting (and visually, and the probability of hits is different).
Heroes of Martin's book come to the battlefield, the troops and leaders (Lannisters and Starks - in the base game, only 2 of the Great House) have its own characters. Play mechanic is harder and deeper BattleLore and not giving "cartoon" (for me it is a plus), elegant but no less filled than the Tide of Iron. Party time from an hour to 3. The scenarios are different, besides you can create your own scenario (skirmish). Yes, and every scenario worked out, as the original mini-game with its own characteristics.
The minuses: FAQ is not present yet and answer for questions about controversial moments we need gather up the pieces, but it is a matter of time. There are many controversial moments on the leadership cards (Hero's ability etc).
Quality components at altitude. Itemized higher than in BattleLore. But, yes - it is necessary to glue all the figures.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It really does have some nice additions to the traditional Battlelore/C&C: Ancients mechanics, with the use of order tokens to move your men in addition to having leader cards to move multiple troops at once. The game has some nice dynamism across the battlefield, but the minis and additional rules slow the gameplay down quite a bit.

Easily the best of the Command & Colors series.  Changing the Flank cards to Leader cards (reminiscent of EastFront HQs) is exactly what this system needed to work for me.  Combined with the order chits, and this is an excellent game.

Our only beef with the basic set (I haven't seen the expansions) is how worthless the archers are.  We have a house rule: They defend as Green, but move and attack as Blue.  They still have Off-Balance.  Works for us.

This is my favourite of the "Commands & Colo[u]rs" family of games, even though, mysteriously, it is not included in the "Commands & Colo[u]rs" family of games.  It finally removes the left/centre/right aspect of the battlefield and makes everything centred around leaders, which is a much more interesting way of doing things.  Setup is a chore, as is typical for this (non)family of games, but my major complaint is that the naturally horrendous FFG rulebook makes an already complex game painfully difficult to learn, and required a complete fan rewrite to turn it into something coherent.  (Interesting note: Playing this game got me to check out the much-hyped Game of Thrones TV series, though I quit when in season 2 I couldn't remember why this person was mad at that person and that person was mad at the other person...)  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

RATING: 8
I actually like these rules more than Command & Colors Ancients or Napoleonics. The order token and leadership card activation beats the left-center-right card activation system of command and colors hands down. When played with painted miniatures, this is simply one of the most beautiful games when laid out on the table. I also like the morale track concept even though it usually isn't a factor in most games and the fact that leaders have different and individual abilities. The only issues that prevent me from giving it a 10 is the lack of other major houses(a sea raider/amphibious assault Greyjoy army anyone?) and the fact that the rules out of the box left several major holes and unresolved issues. Later clarifications and FAQs have rectified these but it may scare off more casual players.

Le Case di Westeros hanno sotto il loro commando vaste armate di armigeri, sia a cavallo sia a piedi. Questi uomini coraggiosi sono armati non solo con lance, spade e archi, ma anche macchine d’assedio e altri strumenti da guerra. Attraverso Westeros, i tamburi di Guerra stanno chiamando soldati, forti e coraggiosi, e comandanti, astuti e risoluti. Chi risponderà alla chiamata?  

In questo gioco da tavolo epico di battaglie, i giocatori possono controllare o la Casa Stark, i difensori di Grande Inverno, che hanno chiamato i loro alleati a difendere il loro onore e le loro terre, o la Casa Lannister, una forza aggressiva alimentata dalle ingenti ricchezze di Castel Granito.

This game cleared up all of the problems I had with Memoir '44 and Commands and  Colors: Ancients.  I really didn't like the hand management aspect of those games.  There were so many times that I wanted to do something on a flank and I couldn't do it because my cards wouldn't let me.

When I play BoW (I wish I could play this more) I can look at the board and make a strategy for how I want to proceed.  I can then use my cards to make my plan happen.  This was not possible all too often with the other Battle Lore system games.



I think BoW also has more interesting scenarios then the other Battle Lore games.  Just playing for flags felt the same and made for very gamey situations.

Love the theme also...just don't love the set up time.

My wife played this with me once...thought she had me beat until the last round of the first scenario.  Good times, we just don't have the time to play it very often.

Because I couldn't get this game played I put it up for trade.  It is a good game and deserves to be played.  One of the best games I have ever  traded away.

RATING: 6.8
I enjoyed my first play of this, in part due to some terrible tactics by my opponent that perhaps made the scenario seem much more balanced than it actually is.

Assuming that the rest of the scenarios are equally balanced (I have no idea if this is true), then this is a promising addition to the Memoir set of games.

It has a far higher toy quality than Commands & Colours, but also seems to offer much more varied strategies than that game. If future plays end up being as promising as the first, I might well end up picking up a copy of this.

Update: The rules overhead is just too much. If this isn't a lifestyle game, then there's a ton of flicking idly through the rulebook each time you want to play. This was most evident having just played BattleLore where DoW cleverly give each player a reference card showing what each unit does, how it moves etc. BoW - nothing.

Rating down from 7.6 to 6.8.

This neatly builds up on the already great battlelore-system. And it is different enough to justify a place in my collection. What I really liked is the importance and the factor of teh commanders on the battleground (as opposed to "I have a level 2 cleric -not here in battle - but be sure, I do have it" in Battlelore) Don't get me wrong, I love Battlelore, but this is an interesting difference. Also very nice is the way armies are activated or the way they can be activated. The map is not divided into left, right and middle anymore, but armies should be within two fields reach of their commanders. Also, this is where the new dice come into play. The chance to hit unexperienced troops is higher than to hit elite troops, but: it's more difficult to activate red troops by means of dice. 

Really, nice. And that was just the first scenario. I'm eager to see how the game plays with "war dogs"(?), setting structures on fire and more. 
Oh, almost forgot: stunningly detailed miniatures!

A difficult game to rate. Customized in both bits & rules, & regular play to internalize the rules, it would be an '8'. Painted well, it's drop dead gorgeous. 

[i]Update:[/i] rating dropped after playing C&C:Nappy  and having over a month go by since playing. After C&C:Nappy, I can see the goodness of the system in cleaner form, and unless Westeros is custom ruled & played enough in sequence, the fiddliness of action chits & hero special rules get in the way.

This rating could rise right back up if after Ian's completion of the project aspect can get this into a long weekend type of gaming to internalize the rules & get it flowing. 

***
Early rating - "8"[u]First play of game sunk hooks (using modified rules + Ian's house rules):[/u] first scenario was a bloodbath as the Lannister's, having taken the wood, rushed the gap in the last round to win. A game with the "story" potential of WotR on a small, skirmish level that I hope (with familiarity) play quickly & with great variety. If this can find that sort of flow the rating will rise.

I think those working on the rules issues to keep the game alive is a worthy effort. And the paint & customization done by Ian [kentoad] turns it all into a fine collision of senses as well as tactics.

In Battles of Westeros, two players recreate the military conflicts set in George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series, taking part in battles directly from the books... or designing their own. In this epic board game of battlefield tactics, players control either House Stark, the wards of Winterfell who have called their hearty allies to defend their honor and lands, or House Lannister, an aggressive force funded by Casterly Rock’s endless supply of gold.

This is a great switch from the CC/Memoir 44 gamestyle. I feel that taking away the three sectors and focusing on leaders provides a much more tactical engagement. Leaders are so important. You can't neglect it.

RATING: 6.5
My first impression is that it is very linear and programmatic compared to its C&C relatives. You can be pretty much certain that all or all but one or two of your units will move each round, and with only 4 or 5 rounds in each scenario there's not much wiggle room. It's also absurdly difficult to capture commanders, who can keep moving around and attacking at full strength even after their unit has been decimated. 

That said, I do very much like some of the ideas presented here, and the focus on leaders, who feel very well individuated.

This suffers from the same problem as much of the rest of the more complicated Command and Colors games, namely that it's just too long for what it offers.  I remain convinced that [gameid=10630] is the best implementation of this system, because the simplicity lines up with the playtime.  Ideas like zone of command, unit order tracking, and formation are out of place in this type of game.

What's worse, the battles don't feel that thematic.  Sure, Lannisters fight the Starks, but everything feels like a skirmish, and not a battle.  It doesn't feel like there's much riding on the outcome of this.

Best game of its type,superior to Battelore in almost every significant aspect.
Not terribly complicated for a wargame of this depth,and i personally love the intelligent use of commanders giving orders to their troops,with those units stuck out on a limb having to react the best they can.Melees are swirling and messy,with the heroes becoming the focus of the action,which is how it should be,particularly given this setting.
Also dispenses with the controversial section command card system which drives Battlelore/Memoir 44,which is a good thing.

Have to say I found this rather dissapointing when compared to its "basic" parent, I suppose it is because it added an aditional level of complexity to an elegant rules system slowing the game in my opinion, It would be like compareing memoire'44 to Tide of iron; should you prefer tide you will probably prefer this to battlelore

Let's face it.  I'm a fan of the C&C system.  I thought BattleLore was innovative with the addition of magic ju-ju but this one takes it to a new level by getting rid of the 3 zones of card play and opens up the game to command initiative.  It doesn't hurt that my wife likes the George Martin series of books on the matter.

I've got no prior experience with any battle systems but...
I feel like there's too much randomness, the units are not diversified enough and certain mechanics are missing. High learning curve doesn't bother me much.
In plus: the emotions are TENSE! :) Also encouraged me to seek for some other (pseudo)battlesystems

Rules hard to read (compared - BattleLore rules were a breeze). A lot of components for such kind of game. Difficult learning curve (unlike BL). While gameplay probably is deeper than in BL, it doesn't compensate for complexity. Oh, and a lot of components to glue - I'd rather to play something instead of spending days for gluing.

This game is fun but requires way too much strategy for me.  I struggle thinking several turns ahead and therefore get slaughtered when I play it

Need lots of time investment to learn all the rules (and process quite some errata and FAQs). But once mastered: brilliant!

A world class prick of a game. Took three hours of assembly - requires cutting and glue'ing. Sorry, but for this amount of money, and only half the minis compared to Battlelore, this game has a lot going against it before it even hits the table. And that for a gameline (Battlelore) that was supposed to do away with the Games Workshop craze. Oh the humanity.

Am still exploring the game in solo play; the rating only reflects FFG's frankly inexcusable handling of this game (not rectified but magnified by the ridiculously overpriced expansions, which also require assemblage - wtf?). And that's *before* we even raise the touchy issue of whether this game should have been subtitled "a Battlelore game" or not (frankly, I feel either way there'd have been flamewars).

A very poorly handed IP. FFG's aggressive pace to acquire one IP after the other (all of Star Wars this month, Tolkien earlier this year) is frankly out of synch with the amount of quality gaming material they can release.

Smart leader mechanism. We found the generals too be too dominant in the basic rules, but with the additional joint attack variant, it seems just right. Nice and varied scenarios which encourages tactical moves. Great game to play with the girlfriend :)

A bit fiddly, but I like the Hero activation. Reminds me a bit of Panzer Grenadier.

A trade for this would include several expansions: Lords of the River, Tribes of the Vale, Wardens of the North, Wardens of the West. Like a dummy, I saved none of the expansion packaging, so you would get bags of minis.  Comes with the add-on banners and extra dice. (Yeah, I was into this for a while.) Offers to trade in the KC region would be especially attractive. Grail games considered: Napoleon's Triumph, AH's Ginslinger, Up Front (original box edition).

Production quality is up to FFG standards and it looks fantastic when set-up. I made my own insert, painted some figs, bought the fancy banners... 

I've tried a few C&C games since purchasing this one and to my mind this is still probably the best. Although there is some of FFG's trademark fiddlyness, the varied win conditions raise my interest in this one a touch higher than the rest.

Edit: Rating falling.. Damn that set-up time!

Have STARTED to play this game twice. After figuring out the rules, I like it fine, but my partners in crime found it to be far too complicated and boring to halfway finish a battle. "Too many rules" is the refrain, oddly coming from avid players of Magic and D&D.

RATING: 6.5
Thought the setup vs enjoyment was a little skewed. Just a little disappointed in the game personally, as I would rather just play M44 since it's quicker and less fiddly but similar. Had high hopes, guess it just doesn't suit me.

I'd play this game if I showed up somewhere and it was ready to go.

Traded for Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear.

Takes Battle Lore and makes it mostly better.  Heavy armor finally harder to hit.  Leadership cards and order chips work better than cards for map thirds - no more handful of cards in a section with no units.  Commanders are a nice addition, but they are not as interesting as the Battle Lore powers and monsters.  Objectives are also a better way to determine who won - no more losing green units and losing despite having a bunch of red units still on the board.
Only downside is that Westeros is not as solo friendly as Battlelore.

Bad implementation of the Command & Colors system.  I immediately traded this off.

RATING: 9.5
Great miniature battle game. It has a lot of tactics involved and clashing with big armies is just fun. 
You really feel like commanding a medieval army. Terrain usage is something to keep in mind. The cards play a minor role, it's all about tactics and moving your units in a good position. Formations are important. It enhances the Commands & Colours mechanics.

Some minor points are : not everything is balanced, some scenario's are much easier for one side and the red cavalry Robb stark is just too strong. The morale track hardly moves (somewhat fixed with additional rules). You can make your own skirmishes, but they can be very unbalanced.

RATING: 6.5
It certainly is a lovely game - the puzzle pieces are charming and the cards are very colorful. The game play, however, is rather mundane to a point. I do like the decision on upgrades and when to place your diver. The way you upgrade is interesting as well. And it very approachable - kids will love it as much as adults. I might just keep it around because of this.

Oceanos has two mechanics I like, card drafting and set collection. There are some light engine building and push your luck elements which are among my favourites as well but these two do not play a major role.

Although the game plays nice and is basically harmless, it is not very rewarding. Evaluating the worth of each card is rather easy and there are very few trade-offs to make. Your performance in the game is very dependent on whether you manage to get the crystals and diving pod symbols allowing you to upgrade your vessel. It is pretty much impossible to win without several upgrades. This increases the importance of luck to unnecessary big proportions which undermines the whole experience. But if you draw the few necessary cards Oceanos offers some light decision making in a reasonable playing time. Maybe good with kids.

7 wonders light. Somewhat luck dependant and the optimal sequence of developments probably can be solved, but the gameplay is quick, the game time is short, the graphics is gorgeous and the overall experience is very enjoyable. 

Recommended famaily game or long filler.

RATING: 6
A modest, simple card drafting/tableau game with cute cardboard submarines comprised of different parts (capabilities) that can be upgraded.  I think this is a very nicely thematic, introductory card drafting/capability game for young children.  For experienced gamers, on the other hand, it felt a bit too simplistic and luck-based, leading at times, to moderate amounts of annoyance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I would actually place this game in the category of "filler" games - something very enjoyable with interesting decisions that can play in ~30 minutes if you already know the game.  Love it for all the reasons I love 7 Wonders; I rated it slightly higher because it doesn't include combat and the point system is less brain burning for novice gamers.

Bit of RNG with the treasure tiles and the negative effects for having too many kraken eyes.

RATING: 9
Splendid, fun set collection with an amazing theme and vivid artwork, Bauza knocks it out of the park once again and this is a great alternative to Seven Wonders, and I'd also say a solid family weight game, easy to teach others and suck them into the hobby.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The art is great, the theme is fantastic, and the upgrade mechanisms just fit well. So where did it all go wrong? I love drafting mechanisms, and Bauza is a master of those; but here, the "innovative" aspect of the drafting turned what is usually a balancing mechanism into a real luck-driven aspect I really didn't care for. The captain never gets crystals, and if you can't draw them yourself, you're pretty much done for.

I would play again, but it's definitely not a game I really enjoy.

RATING: 6.5
Oceanos is a light-weighted, family-friendly game of card drafting and submersible upgrading.  

At nearly 20 minutes for a two-player game, it is a fairly quick game of three rounds; during which, you will play approximately 15–24 cards onto your personal play area. 

The components are colourful and enhance the underwater expedition setting. While the submarines are attractive, they do not all fit snugly together. For me, this isn't game breaking but is a minor annoyance.    

While the game is alright with two players, I suspect that at a greater player count, the game would improve (with more players, the Captain of the round—the dealer—would likely have more cards from which to chose; therefore, once around, you would have a plethora of cards, thereby giving you better odds of drawing the specific card that you need).

A drafting game with a slight twist as it requires dealing out cards every turn instead of passing them around the table with all the discards coming back to the dealer for that turn. The game is still fast and played in 45 minutes with it being everyone's first game but there just seemed to be a lot of fiddly aspects to it. Lots of little rules for a light game and lots of moving pieces especially exchanging pieces on your submarine. For a drafting game this light Sushi Go or Dream Home is the way to go. I feel the hype got to me on this one a bit as the components and art are top notch like Iello always does, but there just doesn't seem to be a lot of fun here as the rules overtake the enjoyment.

Monsieur Bauza does it again! This is a truly beautiful game, both artistically and mechanically. It uses a variation on card drafting, a bit of push your luck and a fantastic submarine upgrade system which initially seems like a bit of a gimmick, but which is actually central to playing the game well.
I played it with the family and it was an instant hit with all of us. Simple to understand, yet with lots of meaningful decisions.

I really *wanted* to like this game. It's pretty look at, and the rules seem to be pretty straight-forward.

Alas, certain rules are needlessly confusing and could have been helped by better player aids or additional bits (why not have tokens for the crystals so you're clear when they get used?). Going to pass on this one - I don't need it for our collection.

It gave me the feeling that everything is pretty much worth the same amount of points.  Tokaido does that for me too.   The production here is way over the top and the game is a table hog, but it does look pretty.   Works well as a simple family game and I'd play it again but probably won't seek to acquire a copy.

2016-10-27 : Beneath the funny theme and cute graphics hides a really neat little engine building game. Since you're free to choose which part(s) of it you'll upgrade - and they're all important - you have to put on your thinking cap for this. Sure, there's a factor of randomness in the cards you get, but there was almost always a choice to be made and a half dozen ways to earn points. It's a family game a gamer wouldn't mind playing, which is about as much as you can ask from it.

A feather light card drafting game with an ocean theme and a bit of a "press your luck" element where you are exploring the ocean and trying to get crystals and bases to upgrade your little submarine so you can have a better chance of scoring more points at game end. You can upgrade your periscope to get a choice of more cards, your fuel tank to be able to keep extra cards, your aquarium to be able to see more unique fish, your diving bell so you can send more divers down for treasure, and your propeller for straight up points every round. Every round the person with the most Kraken eyes attracts the attention of the Kraken and loses points. Card selection and placement matters as at the end of the game you score a point for every coral in your largest group of coral, and you may send your divers down in a column to retrieve treasure so you need to be able to place those chests one below the other.

The production quality is high except that some of the submarine pieces don't fit properly as puzzle pieces (some are too tight and some are too loose), and the artwork is gorgeous - cartoony, bright and colourful. The rules are clear and the game is easy to understand. The premise of the game is fun and potentially interesting, but (as with most drafting games) it doesn't play that well with just 2 players. It's still [i]enjoyable[/i], but not that tense or interesting. I can't say I felt like I had any agonising decisions to make about either keeping a card or passing it to my opponent. If I thought a card was too good for him then I could just discard it to the bottom of the deck whereas in a multiplayer game I think I would try to be more aware of what cards have been passed to the other players. 

A very pleasant family game, but a bit dull with just 2. Would recommend for 3+ groups and younger family members.

RATING: 6
Really novel approach to card drafting here that I actually quite like and I think it can have quite the depth of strategy.

Very simple tableau building and scoring system, however it is a bit let down by the rule book as several rules are unclear and could be interpreted in several ways.

Cardboard submarine pieces are over produced and not really required but  they do add to the theme, unfortunately some of the jigsaw like pieces do not fit together very well.

I love the artwork, especially the octopus with the short tentacles making a dandy mustache :D

She said the submarine parts should have just "touched together" and not have been puzzle pieces.  I couldn't agree more.  They would have been functionally as good without any frustration.

That being said, I do appreciate the upgrading and the inability to do all upgrades and how each one can be a significant value.  Really adds an extra layer to a solid lightweight drafting game.  The art and components are good and the playtime and fun factor are too.

RATING: 7.5
Components: good quality overall, submarine pieces don't click as they should, but nothing important
Complex: easy to teach and learn
Weight: light
Players: 3 or 4
Length: less than 60 mins
Mechanics: draft, set collection
Decisions: enough for a light game, which card to play, what to develop...
Opinion: I call this one light, instead of family, because the strategy to follow is a bit more complex than a family game.
You have your submarine and start to discover the sea, the surface, a bit deeper and the bottom. For doing so you will play cards forming a delicious picture of the sea, and everything that is there (animals, corals, treasures, krakens....). By the end of the game you will have a really lovely pictures.
Each turn you will receive some cards (2 at the beginning, and more if you develop your periscope) and play one (can play more if you use your fuel). Cards not played go to the Captain of that turn, and he chooses one of them to be played (if less cards than periscope, the draws more, but can have more cards than his periscope, although all of them are discards from the rest of the players).
And mostly this is the game, what is funny then? Everything, the decision on what card to play, should I go for some develops on my submarine (each part can be developed bringing more fuel, more scubas, more animals to score, more cards to draw, some points at the end), should I go for animals if I can take them on my aquarium, should I try for treasures with my scubas, or try to get some points with the coral... hey, I have so many kraken eyes, and I am going to loose points!!!
Really enjoyable game, with enough decisions to be a light game and a very beautiful picture on your table at the end

Oceanos is a joy to play, gorgeous on the table and perfect for families while still having enough meat on the bones to appeal to hobby gamers. The various ways you can upgrade your ship are interesting and thought provoking and the card drafting/selection gives the player significant agency. My only complaint is that the puzzle pieces fit together a bit tight, which slows the game down a bit when you upgrade as you are trying not to damage the cardboard. I hope they loosen up upon future plays. However, this is merely a nitpick. I'm happy to play this just about anytime.

Bauza egy újabb nagyon egyszerű játékot készített. Ez nem is családi játék, hanem inkább gyerekjáték, kb. 5-8 éveseknek. Lapokat húzunk és abból egyet rakunk le. Cél, hogy lapokon jó különböző kombinációk legyenek. 5 körön keresztül csináljuk és a végén pontozunk, majd három ilyen forduló után vége a játéknak. Minden különböző hal 2 pontot ér, de a kezdő akváriumban csak 3 hal fér el. Ha sikerül leraknunk kristályt majd tengeralattjárót, akkor fejleszthetjük a tengeralattjárónk valamely részét. A periszkóp fejlesztésével több kártyát húzhatunk, a tartály fejlesztésével több kártyát rakhatunk le, az akvárium fejlesztésével több halunk lehet, a propeller fejlesztésével több pontot kapunk, a vezető fülke fejlesztésével több búvárt tudunk a kincsekért kiküldeni. Ugyanis a kártyákon kincses ládák vannak és ha búvárokat kiküldjük akkor a játék végén húzhatunk véletlenszerűen kincseket, amelyeken pontok vannak. Továbbá a kártyákon korallok vannak és ha sikerül összefüggő korallzátonyt építenünk, az mind 1-1 pont. Kraken szemek pedig a fordulók végén mínusz pontokat jelenthet. 
Nagyon könnyed, nagyon egyszerű, csak gyerekekkel való játékra javaslom.

Nice, light game with enough to think about.

2-player mode is very good.  You can discard cards useful for an opponent (->control) and the game becomes sort of battle of minds.

My gripe is that the game is overproduced... :-//  Yeah, I know, it targets families so it should attract them with its lavishness, but I just don't like it.  Such simple games should be compact and neat.

EDIT: Not so agonizing decisions as I had hoped for and not enough tension.  The randomness is not insignificant either.

Sold.

Quite overproduced for a simple drafting game. The set collection is interesting and there are some push your luck elements of where you place your treasures and corals. The rules are very simple and I can see the game is designed to be appealing to a younger group of players. Highly recommended family game.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (February 2017)

Antoine Bauza is mostly a miss for me, so I wasn’t expecting anything good from the game and I was right. Oceanos is a great looking game but too boring and simple for us.

The rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 10 minutes. Playtime is under one hour.

The game´s components are great! IELLO always deliver in the production values department. The art is also amazing! The game looks gorgeous in the table. 

The theme is ok.

Oceanos is VERY similar to another game I dislike (The Little Prince: Make Me a Planet), the game´s decisions are obvious and luck of the draw is very high.
 
Bottom line, Oceanos can be a great family game, but I dislike it. Bauza (almost) never delivers for me (I love Hanabi). Oceanos is a very simple game with obvious decisions and lots of uncontrollable luck. I already sold my copy of the game.

It's a lot of cardboard for such a light, straightforward drafting game.  That gripe aside, the game's mechanics are simple enough that my 7 year-old (impatient) daughter learned them quickly and effectively. The components and the art work are terrific. Players looking for strategic depth are likely to be disappointed. Still, Oceanos is a lot of fun for a family game night or for a group of adults who are young at heart.

Easy to learn, fast to play cardgame which is over-produced. Although the submarine parts looks good, changing those puzzle pieces isn't that smooth - simplier tiles would work much better.

RATING: N/A
Each player pilots her own submarine trying to spot the most underwater species and the largest coral reef, sending scuba-divers after forgotten treasures, collecting precious crystals to upgrade their ship and to escape the fearsome kraken's gaze...
Each submarine is divided into five parts, each of them independently upgradable from level 1 to level 3 and each one of them controlling a different ability of the player (however, there are no different abilities from one player to another). As there are multiple ways to score points and multiple takes on the submarine-upgrading order, the game offers several ways to win. The whole game takes mere 15 turns, each one of them simultaneous between all players, which makes it a fairly quick family game.
Even though the submarines have the same abilities game-wise, each looks differently, and a special attention was obviously given also to the depiction of marine life.

Le jeu est très joli (illustration et matériel), mais tout ce matériel est inutile et gonfle au final le prix de la boîte. Un simple jeu de cartes aurait largement suffi.

First impression after one three player game.  Light and breezy, with little downtime.  Easy to teach and learn, easy to see what one can do, enough different strategies and options.  Although it is an MPS it does not feel like an MPS because of how quick and breezy the gameplay is and because of the card drafting mechanism.  We spent enough time interacting and looking at other palyers rather than one's tableau and no room for AP.  Bauza is perfecting card drafting and is clearly in his comfort zone of design expertise, bravo Mr. Bauza.

An amazingly beautiful card drafting, set collection, engine building game that gives you a bunch of balanced paths to victory.

I've seen complaints that the card draw is too random - I think these complaints miss the point, which is that pushing your luck, playing the odds and mitigating the luck of the draw with upgrades is the whole point of the game. You need to set yourself up where you have something you can do on each round, rather than having to draw an exact card type in each position.

The submarines are neat-looking, but the cardboard is not exactly fitting together.
There is one thing perfect about this game, and that's illustrations. Tipping my hat to Jeremie Fleury. As for the gameplay, it's a fun family game, that only has depth in the figurative sense. Can't wait for my kid(s) to be old enough to play it, though. :)

EDIT: Extra points for the two player rules. Slightly meaner and lot more fun game.

Oceanos is a light family game at its core. The players are creating a 3-level ocean that they are exploring. The game includes set collection amongst several other point scoring mechanisms and gorgeous artwork adorns the design.

For some reason I thought this was going to be Bauza's simplified version of 7 Wonders, but it actually has very little in common with 7 Wonders. The game is centered around an interesting melding of card drafting and the "I split, you choose" mechanisms, and it works really well. The scoring is very simple, and somewhat swingy in a couple areas, but I like it. Also, the upgrading of your submarine is very cool, and gives the game a nice little engine-building feel. Overall I was really impressed by this game, especially when I went into this not expecting much. It's heavier than Tokaido and Takenoko, but it isn't quite on the level of Ghost Stories or 7 Wonders, which makes this a pretty fresh offering from Bauza. I have a feeling that this game is going to need an expansion or two to keep it interesting for the long haul, and unfortunately iEllo isn't known for doing them apart from the King of Tokyo stuff.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]8[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]My original thoughts still stand; Oceanos is an excellent family weight game that's a breeze to learn. I haven't been able to play in the last year which is a disappointment considering how much my older daughter and I enjoyed it. I'm considering picking it up since my youngest is starting to play more complex games. I'm not sure everthing would click for her right away, but I don't think it would take long for her to pick it up. Definitely worth checking out if you enjoy lighter games that play in under an hour.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]My buddy Mat put this on my radar and towards the end of the month I got an opportunity to play Oceanos with him. Oceanos is one of the best light drafting games I've played and would make an excellent family game even if you have younger children. The artwork is fun and cartoony, it has the typical Iello aesthetic that definitely will appeal to kids. 

Oceanos can be taught in a few minutes and plays like many drafting games with a few twists that I really enjoy. There is a spacial element to the game where cards are laid out in a simple tableau that spans the depths of the sea (there are 3 rounds and 3 levels of card, one for each round). This effects how the game is scored and offers opportunity to plan ahead as you play. The other twist is the submarine each player has which grants different powers/ways to score points. Each part of the sub (I think there are 6) can be upgraded increasing the effectiveness of certain actions.

The combination of a few simple twists in a drafting game plus the quick play time make Oceanos a game I'd like to play again and consider adding to our collection once my youngest daughter is a bit older.[/i]

This one fell flat.  It is absolutely beautiful -- each submarine is stylistically different, gorgeous art, nice pieces -- but the play seems to be a whole lot of set up followed by just not very much substance.  Wanted to like it, might be persuaded otherwise later, but for now it's a very solid MEH.

RATING: 5
It does have a decent idea, in that each turn you play one of two cards to your scoring tableau and give one back to the dealer, who then gets to play one of these discards from the other players. But in practice it doesn't seem to work well, as it generates downtime while players wait for the dealer to make their decision. This isn't good given the fluffy theme doesn't hold you in by itself. In principle you're choosing between cards which give you submarine upgrades or points, and you can choose upgrades that give you more power (more cards to look at, etc) or more points. Basic stuff. On top of the downtime, it felt like too many fiddly rules for any payoff, and it seemed too luck based regardless of the upgrades you went for. This one sank for us.

I saw Antoine Bauza and was instantly interested in learning this one. I thought I sat down to play the pre release but it was in fact just a prototype. They did a great job with it! to be released @ GenCon! I will have to pick it up! It is a wonderful card drafting, set collection game. Different sets to look for and symbols to try and upgrade your ship for better features. It is a very fun game. I think I will be able to play this with my family and the art is very charming. I am liking Iello more and more with each game I play! It will not replace 7 Wonders but is a solid game!

Clever card drafting. Pick and pass, set collection, light but has good tactical decisions; a more gateway than 7 Wonders, Among the Stars, and better for younger ages.
Plays quick w/little down time. Modular up-gradable sub. Really attractive and engaging components.
Our initial play felt the game was a little more style than substance, mostly because the art/components were so impressive. It felt w/some randomized scoring tiles, ease of upgrades, that there wasn't much strategy at all, just making the best of what you've got.

Thankfully, it's a short enough game tha I recommend the 1st be a tutorial game and then play for real after that. It takes less than 1 game to get the hang of it.

I was expecting a light game or something to play with the kids.  This game is just bad for any audience.

The so called drafting is really draw N-keep-1.  Initially N=2, so good luck drawing the cards you need in the right order to randomly be allowed to upgrade so that N=3.  Then you might actually get some choices.

One appeal of the game are the modular submarines used to track upgrades.  Except the puzzle piece connectors are the wrong size and don't fit together well.  They are frustrating to operate and easily damaged.  Poor design.

There is almost no interaction -- a tiny sliver in what you pass to the expedition leader but that hardly matters except to perhaps ensure that a player with bad luck gets completely locked out.

The are is cute, although I find an unappealing contrast between the cartoony animals and the scantily-clad female captains.  What audience is this meant for?  I can't figure it out graphically or mechanically.  It just seems bad.

Light drafting/placement game.  The treasure chest draw at the end is just too random and swingy to be fun.

RATING: 4
Not so many meaningful choices across the game. Little to no direct interaction except drafting. Too heavily luck dependent. Not that good game, but is somewhat saved by the fantastic quality of components.

RATING: 8
A very clever, quick and easy card drafting/tableau building game that is just strategic enough to not be boring, and easy enough to play in 20/30 minutes max. Antoine Bauza has crafted a nice game that non gamers will pick up easy enough, with enough subtle meat for the more strategic gamers as well.

The amount of components to punch out is more than any other game I can think of. That they went with five completely unique submarines split into five sections, with each section having three separate layers, meaning there are five players worth of fifteen large submarine parts, is pretty surprising, yet awesome. However, the fact that they made it connect with jigsaw puzzle-like nubs was a big mistake. There's some pieces that don't fit together too easily in my set and those bits will be the first part to get worn down. They really should have just made it flat.

I was a bit worried the game would feel too light, and it is pretty light, but there is some decision making to be had when choosing your cards, so I think as long as this is not a game you're bringing out for players who are in the mood for a heavy game it'll be fine. It's fast enough that the production value should make up for the fact that they're not playing a drafting game as deep as 7 Wonders.

In fact, if you're trying to introduce friends to drafting games and you were considering taking a chance and introducing 7 Wonders to them, I would recommend this game instead, as a bit of a gateway game towards 7 Wonders. It's even by the same designer.

Also, we played it two player and it felt pretty good as a two player game, which is somewhat rare for drafting games, so you might want to consider this game if you're looking for a good two player drafting game.

Overall a fun game, helped by the novelty of the beautiful art and crazy production values. I enjoyed it and look forward to introducing more players to the game.

The art in this game is stupendous. The component quality is pretty stellar save some of the submarine puzzle pieces that didn't really fit together too well. I don't really know why it had to be puzzle pieces at all, as you're taking things apart so often. The game is pretty random, and while I won when I played, I didn't really feel like I had much to do with that. I just pick the obvious best card for me at the time. It's good for kids but I don't think I'll hang onto it for long.

The art and component quality is fantastic, but the game is just a bit too much for the time period. It takes up too much table space, the sub components are fidgety to upgrade, and it takes too long to teach.

Great art, components, and table presence. With 2 players the memory element is almost completely absent. So this feels less like a drafting game and more like hand management. Whatever you want to call it this is a very fun game to play!

Just got at auction. I am excited about it though to play with my wife and daughter. We saw a play through of it and it looked like fun especially for my daughter. Played a couple of times and it has some good strategy elements to it. Some trying to mitigate results of drafting too. Nice attention to long term planning. Not heavy into any elements but a good balance of all of them. Decent game. I am thinking it would be really good with 4.

It's so preeeetty. I really like how this game looks. The little subs are fun to put together. The game plays quickly (it's basically always everyone's turn) and I like all the simple but interesting ways to score. Push your luck with divers/chests? Try to get more animals? Are you taking too many kraken icons? It took longer than I expected to get a 5 player game of new players going but I still enjoyed it.

Card drafting.
Take your submarine through three levels of ocean depth, constructing your own underwater world of marine life, coral reefs, and treasure chests to send your divers after. But beware the Kraken.

Good for easing non-gamers into card drafting mechanic.  Otherwise, the game has several decision-making points that keep it interesting, though I don't know about replayability.  Artwork is really good.  Played with two players... probably plays best with 4-5 players.

RATING: N/A
Colourful, captivating, but theme mismatches the dry gameplay. In the end, it is a simple game about set collecting having a spatial component and some 'upgrades' that will allow you to either score more, bash the leader more, score a lot more with some precondition (animals) or score secret.

Even with the cartoony art and the colourful box it is just simple mechanic scoring point salad boredom. Pass.

tl;dr: fine family friendly strategy game

Use card drafting to get some resources to upgrade your sub and score points. It all works well and feels pretty familiar. It's also very accessible and very nicely produced. A fine package indeed. But it isn't very original or deep and I wonder how high the replay value is.

Initial rating: 6.5/10

Demoed this during GenCon 2016. It felt like a fun, lighter family game that may make waves in the gateway game crowd.

As neat as the replacable parts for your sub are, it did feel like an awful lot of additional cardboard for such a simple mechanic.

I'd like to give it a full play in the future.

Card drafting in our personal upgradable submarines to observe the greatest variety of sea life and collect treasures while avoiding the fearsome kraken. Cards have multiple combinations of symbols, the best cards are sure to have the kraken. Multiple single round card drafts with an interesting riff on a cribbage (or 2-player 7 wonders) like hand that is built for the dealer from the other players' discards.  Add cards to your personal tableau to build set collections while avoiding the penalty of having the most kraken.  Score after each wave exploring the surface, shallow, and ocean depths.  Pair energy and bases to upgrade components of the modular ships that allow improvements like bigger hand size, play extra cards, or larger set scoring.  Upgrading the sub is entertaining as is the decision of what to give the dealer and the reveal of what they ended up with.  Simple, satisfying family game.

Great game to play with the family and causal gamers. Plays best with 3 - 5 players, but 2 is ok for a quick filler. Art is gorgeous and fun theme. Some of the cuts on some of the pieces is a little off in some spots and they don't fit the best... but it's not a big deal. Highly recommend as a light game.

RATING: 5
(based on a single play with 4 players)

The game looks light, very light and the choices quite limited: you have 2 cards (at the beginning of the game, more later potentially) and you place one, without the possibility to choose where to place it BUT you try to have series of cards ...

I may give it a second chance soon but it's not sure.

The game is beautiful by the way but it was not enough to balance the lack of choice in my opinion.

I was positively surprised. For a game that looked like it would be just a copy of other tile laying games, I found the theme quite immersive and the submarine upgrading system gave an interesting dimension to the game. Definitely a keep for me, plus it works well for my 7yo.

Updated: Upped to 8.5 rating. We play this twice a day and cannot get tired of it. Easily number #1 in our list for the family currently. Also, 2 players is a thing in this game. Takes 15 minutes to play for the same amount of enjoyment. 7yo and 4yo now play this together. They had never done that before with any other game.

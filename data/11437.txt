RATING: 8.5
The game really recreats the historical flow of the battle. The very detailed map is georgeous and shows detailling facts of the area (some are to check even in nowadays world!!) - Love to play it!

Check http://www.tactiquesnapoleon.com for "Tactique Napoléon" as a Spanish variant to these rules, by bringing together the best of both!

Slugfest. Lots and lots of "the Enemy of France" at first going at a smaller French force. However, the latter are reinforced throughout the day. Will it be to late to save the day ....

No jugado he todavía, pero se trata de otro pequeño monstruo. Comparable o mejor que Ligny y Eylau.

Part of my ill-fated flirtation with Napoleonics games, every one of which I disliked.  This series I never got to play, however.

I was attracted to this system because it seems the only one granular enough to cover facing and formation on the battalion level (the correct level for formations).  But upon closer examination it seems to have a very gradual, step loss type attrition mechanic (with units often having 6, 8 or even more steps, or "increments") with the result that units are very gradually "sanded away" rather than just killed with one attack.  That would be fine if the game had 100 pieces, but these games tend to have hundreds, or thousands. 600 or more counters + heavy rules + very gradual combat results = I'll never play it.

Sold on Ebay.

La Bataille, defenitely not an easy game to learn or even to play. But when you master the most of the rules and get a hang of it, it is a realy awesome game. You need to think ahead, plan the steps of your leaders. Manage you cannons and ammo! Manage you infantry and how it behaves. Manage your Cavalry and make sure they dont run into square formations of the enemy. And then ... the clash begins!

Lots of needless complexity in this system, joined with great maps and counters, makes it hard to judge. But over time I have come to really despise this system as one that is lost in detail at the cost of playing. Too bad, as I have spent lots of money on the games in this system.

Sold. Great tactical battle system but no time to play it. The Lutzen map was very pleasing to the eye. It's a big battle, though, so be ready to leave the game set up for days, if not weeks.

Yes, the graphic is beautiful,yes the map is beautiful,yes the flavour IS Napoleonic.

The rules written for Lützen are better than the previous versions. Introduction of the command chits is a good idea.

Ah, La Bataille series game at last here in BGG.  Complex tactical Napoleonic game series. Rich in context but pale in execution.  However, the series game did draw a large crowd over the coloful counters (you almost see a 2D soldier from the counter in uniform colors) and the period maps. I always suspect this series is more of  collector items of some sort than a game gets played.  Anyhow, this series has an important position in the wargaming history. Just like Advanced Squad Leaders for WW2, La Bataille is ASL to the Napoelon affectionates.

Preliminary rating after one solo scenario (I lost). I enjoy micromanaging Napoleonic battalions, and I´m a sucker for great counter graphics. This is a big, long, complex game with some unclear rules and annoying details, but I´m very forgiving when it comes to this series. The solo scenarios are slightly uninteresting, and I´m not sure I´ll ever get the chance to play the whole battle ftf. It´s a great history lesson, though.

Have played a few of the Peninsular variants of LB.  Good system for studying tactical aspects of era.  Game is in original shrink-wrap.

RATING: 9
This is one game in the series that will maintain the tension throughout. It has a relatively high counter density (by La Bataille standards and features a large combined Prussian/Russian army that totally surprises the lead elements of a French corps. 
Now the French reinforcements will dribble in at the west, then the north and finally the East over a period of ~20 turns. The Question: Can the initial French forces hold out until they are reinforced? Or can the Allied formations use overwhelming force to crush the consecutively arriving groups of reinforcements before they can form up overwhelming numbers?

A nail-biter of a game that brings out the qualities of desperation, despair and dogged determination. A game that will leave you questioning your own abilities to achieve victory.

Well worth the effort! 

Currently playing this with the ML rules set.

Gorgeous components that let you feel as though you're standing over the map table in Nappy's tent. Best with the Regs XXX system, I think.

I like the mess of units all over the map trying to get their act together which can lead to battles all over the area.

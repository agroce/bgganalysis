This is a gorgeous looking game, but hard to find.  Funagain.com sometimes gets in a used copy - that's where I got mine and it was in brand new condition.  For you serious gamer's, keep in mind this is a light game.  Gameplay is quick, so it's a good game to introduce non-gamers to something besides regular playing cards.  Or else play it before the rest of your gaming group arrives.  It has more strategy than is first apparent, i.e.; "Do I work on improving my hand exclusively, or do I work on thwarting other peoples plans?"  Also some tough decisions to make.

RATING: 8
Wow, excellent game!  Plays quick (filler), easy to follow (except, perhaps, for the scoring) and easy to play.  I like how players bid cards from their hand for turn order, and how the cards that are bid become an option for choosing.  Very well-done game!

Unfortunately, I came to this one rather late.  I'll have to keep my eyes peeled to pick up a non-FRED version.

I seem to have a love/hate relationship with Reiner Knizia. I love some of his games but others just hold no appeal to me what-so-ever. This is in the later catagory.

Imagine playing Pit. Now imagine offering 2 cards for trade while someone else is offering 4. Now imagine being able to trade your 2 cards for their 4 cards. That pretty much sums up the game for me. I'd rather be playing Pit.

RATING: 7
[i]Posted: 12/20/09, Rated: 6[/i]

My first reaction when opening the box was "Is that all there is?  A single deck of cards?"  Then I got into the rules: bidding to collect sets, using your potentially-scoring cards as the currency, if you will.  Very reminiscent of [i][thing=46]Medici[/thing][/i], a [person=2]Knizia[/person] classic.

More scoring quirks with "triplets:" each currency has three cards of denomination "20," and three of denomination "30."  If a player has all three cards of the same denomination, of the same currency type, then she scores an extra 100 points.  This complication does a nice job of adding value to the lower-denomination cards.  The coins make for good fodder for being able to exchange some cards, without offering anything up of real value...until the end, when a coin could be worth more than a regular card, if you don't have at least 100 points in that card's currency.

Because the game's rules are so streamlined, it's easy to teach and to play.  It also feels overly light.  There's nothing wrong with that, but again there's nothing overly compelling about it, either.  If I had my choice of Knizia auction titles, I'd rather play [i][thing=46]Medici[/thing][/i], or [i][thing=12]Ra[/thing][/i].  Perhaps if I made one of [geekurl=/user/Verkisto]Verkisto's[/geekurl] [filepage=38793]tuck boxes[/filepage], the enhanced portability of the game could make it a "situational seven."  Even so, it would then compete with the superior [i][thing=12589]Razzia![/thing][/i]

[i]Money[/i] is a great example of a single, well-executed mechanic.  I believe this is a recurring trademark of the games in the [family=76]Gryphon Games bookshelf series[/family] -- see my comments for [i][thing=37615]Looting London[/thing][/i].  [i]Money[/i] is a better offering than that other entry, but it isn't compelling enough on its own to join the list of Knizia greats.

Great little bidding game, the twist on the mechanics is nicely done and has been seen to be useful in my game, well implemented rules are a good thing. The cards are heavy and of good stock with a nice finish and the money itself that is depicted is beautiful. great components, nice light rules, I can see this one having a place in most any collection, it fills the niche for filler and light game, as several can be played back to back in relatively little time.

Light filler game with some interesting choices. By bidding money cards simultanuously you are trying to aquire other money cards. All of this with the goal of collection superior sets. The scoring mechanic is a typical nonsensical Knizia one. But the game works as a filler or closer after a more involved gaming night.

4 plays.  Lots of fun.  Simultaneous action = little down-time, except with slow players.  Similar to Pit in that collecting a full set is worth tons of points, but this game is 10x better than Pit.  I like the "domino effect" of the auction for turn order & choice of "card stacks".  Luck heavy, but short & sweet.  Can mitigate luck by watching which sets other players are collecting.  Good for families & non-gamers.

I'm reducing my rating for this because it seems the optimal way to play is to simply concentrate on 2 currencies, while the other players do so for their own currencies. Basically everyone ends up with all the cards in their selected currencies. Not fun. Maybe we're just not paying enough attention and not trying hard enough to thwart each other's acquisitions.

This is neat - you have to try to get the most with the least, so to speak.  It's fairly easy to guarantee you have first dibs at the items up for auction, but you risk feeding your opponents lots of points.  This is one of those really clever, addictive games that I can see will get better and better with more plays.  Looking forward to lots more of this one.

Can't believe it's taken me a decade to catch up on this.  It's a nice, quick & tricky bidding/set-collecting game with shades of the Lost Cities scoring system.  The tricky part centres around the bids being re-cycled, so a high bid to get what you want risks giving the next highest bidder a windfall - and what starts out as almost blind bidding gets refined as the rounds progress.  Sadly, the best new Knizia I'm likely to play for some time, given his recent output!

To be honest, I'm not sure why I picked this game up in the first place. It's set collection, auctions... stuff I have plenty of in my collection. But, I'm sure glad I did, as I really like this game. This could be right up there with For Sale as my favorite fillers.

It may sound silly, but I love the theme. The currency cards look great, and for an auction/bidding/mathematical game, trading in currencies actually makes sense. The scoring is a bit convoluted, but once people understand the goal they are shooting for, I think they will find this game easy to pick up. This is something I can throw in the bag for a solid, quality 15 minute filler.

Update: I eventually traded this away. It's not a bad game. I like it... but most people I play it with shrug their shoulders and then request other games. For Sale is the better filler and the two are similar enough that this became redundant.

A light set collection game. Only suitable as filler, but, as expected from Knizia, has some definite skill involved, what to hold, how to bid, watching other players, so on. Blind bidding actually works in this completely for me, I think it's essential to the game, and doesn't cause too many problems when a given plan goes awry because you can always pick your bid back up again (assuming someone else hasn't taken it in the meantime) and try again later.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
To describe this game it may not seem like much but the game experience is a lot of fun so I'll give it a seven. You have to take cards out of your hand to bid on cards you want. Two sets of 4 cards are turned over and the highest bidder takes his pick of one of those piles or any of the other bids. The next highest bidder then follows. The two left over bids then get restocked to 4 cards each. It is a relatively simple game but a lot of fun.

RATING: 8
Components: Beautiful recreation of the different currencies, and for some reason I'm not bothered by different currencies sharing the same color scheme, thus making them less easy to distinguish from each other.

Experience: This is a great game of set collection, with players always having several options to choose from to improve their portfolio. It's satisfying to build up my hand of cards, but to try to keep enough free cards to be able to bid. I somewhat pay attention to what other players are collecting, but invariably almost ever currency is being collected by someone, so the only safe bet is to bid an unwanted currency when I see another of the same type already on the table, to ensure that they remain in separate lots.

This is a pretty simple Knizia game. There are 2 sets of cards face up on the table. Everybody bids on them. The top bidder takes the set of his choice and replaces it with his bid. This continues until everyone has mad a switch. Great artwork, although I'm always thrown to see US Grant on the 10, 20, and 50.

Fun game that takes about 20 minutes to play.  The cards are absolutely beautiful!  The only way I seem to get even close to winning is concentrating on holding many "20" and "30" cards so that others do not get many 100 points bonuses.

Money! is a very solid bidding game.  It's simplicity is it's greatest strength. 

I don't like the blind bidding aspect to the game because it can lead to some pretty random outcomes.  I also don't like that the game is abstract, but a random theme is half halfheartedly pasted on.  But it is easy to forgive the game these deficiencies because it is so simple to learn and very fast to play.  All in all, Money! is a very solid game.

RATING: 7
Excellent family game and good filler for gamers.

If you have the choice get the ZMan edition - the more recent one by Gryphon (Fred) had an unnecessarily large box, with equally unnecessary insert; the front card art is not as good (although it's not bad) and the card back art work is poor. On top of that is offensively over-priced for what is simply a deck of 74 cards.

Ok set collecting game. Some interesting mechanics here such which forces you to rally concentrate on some sets to score points. perhaps I'm missing something but to me it seemed like everyone just collected "their" set and didn't really compete over other sets.

RATING: 6
One of the fluffy fillers that Knizia does so well. Players are currency dealers trying to build a portfolio in world currencies. A deck of cards feature stunning art representing several of the world's currencies, in different denominations. Players simultaneously bid some of their hand, with each player in bid order able to claim another player's bid, or one of two pools of cash in the centre of the table. When the deck runs dry, your portfolio is totalled. There are penalties for not making a minimum score, and bonuses for sets. Excellent end of evening game.

I won this one handily with 1070 points (all the blue money, most of another currency, and a set of 30's).

I enjoy the mechanic of taking cards and immediately having to decide on whether to bid them or not.  Money is a game that when playing with someone new, you can "see" the light bulb go off in their head about a quarter of the way through the game.  In my experience, everyone I've shown it to requests a second game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Set collection, with a minimum size in order to avoid a penalty, a la Lost Cities, but not as punishing.   Blind bidding drives the game, and the idea that you can collect someone else's bid instead of the two lots in the center is a neat idea.  So that establishes the main feel of the game, which is that you are all just passing cards around.   The scoring is classic convoluted Knizia, and I wish they gave a reference card, or put the scoring bonuses on the bluff card.   Speaking of which...  why wouldn't you always play the bluff card?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This feels like Pit in slow motion and without any interaction which of course makes it not very fun. It seems like the winner is most likely going to be the one who happens to be lucky enough to be the only one chasing after particular currencies, while those who are fighting for the same one's won't know it until its too late.

Gryphon Games reprint - one of Knizia's best card games, as players make trades (order determined by blind binding) to try to improve their portfolio of banknotes (set collecting mechanic, with some usual Knizia twists in scoring).

Played with 3 and enjoyed this light game.  I get tired of auction games, but for some reason this one is just fine.  Easy rules, fast play, eye appeal, A good family game, filler game.    3 hands makes a game.  

I am disappointed in the quality of the cards.  These cards have only been played by adults and we take great care of the games--hands and table are cleaned before play--yet after only 10 games, the edges of the cards are very dirty.  Sometimes cards (especially the edges) seem to have a magnet towards dirt, and these cards are among the worst I have ever owned.  Years ago I owned some playing cards that did the same, but only after a lot more plays.

Money is a fairly typical Knizia filler: small footprint, easy rules, somewhat obscure scoring. And, of course, despite the simple rules, playing well is not all that obvious.

A game of this length and depth can generally even get away with blind bidding as the core mechanism. What doesn't work so well, however, is that due to the way scoring works all currencies have a tendency to bunch together - which is sort of the goal but isn't so great when it happens all by itself anyway.

An interesting concept; a card game about nothing but trading to complete sets of currencies.  The catch is that you bid how much you're willing to trade each round secretly.  The rounds are timed just right so that it is very hard to complete sets in time, and someone who knows this and how to accomplish the goal will have a great advantage over newbies.  This advantage will only last for the first couple rounds of the first game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Money! can be tough to wrap your head around due to the fact that what you're trying to acquire, and the items you're using for payment, are so intermingled.

In a traditional auction game, you have a pool of money that you use to buy stuff. That separation (between goods and cash) is clear and easy to understand. But in Money!, they're both the same -- the "cash" you use for future purchases is (partially) what you're bidding on. This has some unusual consequences.

For example, consider the situation where a "perfect" collection of cards comes up for auction. ("Perfect" being defined as a set in which you're trying to collect every card.) In most games, this would be great -- you want everything so it's all wheat and no chaff. But that can be a death-trap in Money! You *need* there to be a bunch of "garbage" in every lot, because you'll use that garbage for further purchases.

For me, this lead to a challenging, but not necessarily fun, game.

Can Reiner Knizia design an unsatisfying auction game? All accounts point to no. Sure, it's not quite as good as For Sale, but that just leaves this game in contention to be the second best auction filler game ever designed. Not a bad consolation, that.

Knizia as we know and love him. Short rules, but many things to think about. This is another small blind bidding game, but since you will always get something, it's not too bad. 

It actually reminds me of "Modern Art" (which I like a lot), like a smaller and faster version of it. While it's not at the same level, it's a nice and fun game, speically for this size.

Wow. A Knizia that plays in 15 minutes! Some blend of luck, mixed with bluffing, bidding, and set collecting. The scoring is confusing at first, like most Knizia's, but straight-forward thereafter. Seems trivial, but as always, there's plenty of depth if you're willing to look deeper. Perfect as an aperitif, lite-filler, or after-dinner mint.

[COLOR=#009900]$[/COLOR] - The stuff you're collecting is also the currency you have to use to buy more stuff!  Collect or spend?  Collect or spend?  I will chew the carpet now.

[COLOR=#0000FF]€[/COLOR] - Mathematically tight with the usual [i]Dr. K's Patented CrazyScore™ System[/i]: every set you score is -100 points [i]unless[/i] you get to 200 points, in which case you score [i]all[/i] the points... So if you get 190 points it scores as 90, but if you cross the line to 210 you get 210!  [i]Ha-ha-ha![/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]¥[/COLOR] - It's got bluffing, hosing, teeth-gnashing, more hosing, and insano-groupthink.

Well, the first play was with 5.  It was a little too chaotic for my taste at that number.  You basically just played whatever and then took what you wanted at that point.

I want to try it again with less.

It does of course have a nice Knizia scoring system.  It's a little rough to explain, and everyone has to know it up front.  But it is at least a little something different compared to Coloretto/6 Nimmet :)

IMO, Knizia's second-best filler after Zirkus Flohcati (and not counting Quandary/Loco/Flinke Plinke/Botswana as a filler). Like Modern Art, this is game where the theme kina works not because of the game's setting but because what you do in the game mirrors something in real life -- you gotta spend money to make money. And like Quandary/Loco/Flinke Plinke/Botswana, this is a game with more depth than is apparent at first -- I have friends who win at it far more than chance can explain.

A fun filler that plays well with four.  I've only achieved the ellusive "two full sets (1000 pts)" once in a four player game.

A key to this game is to identify what everyone else really wants, and being able to shift gears quickly.  Hang on to those 20's and 30's whenever possible to prevent others from completing their bonus sets.  You also have to decide when to grab something you actually need, versus when to grab something of purely higher total value to allow yourself a larger bid in the future.

Small Knizia card game filler, which feels just a bit too boring and run-of-the-mill'ish to me, almost as if Reiner had put this together in his sleep: Grab some cards in various suits and values, add an innovative way of exchanging the cards you start with for others and a complicated way of scoring your cards at the end of the game. Slap on a theme (talking of themes in games like this one is almost laughable), and off to the publisher!

In short, I was not impressed and think Reiner does medium- and heavyweight games much better.

Money! is a pretty enjoyable and quick card game.  It's a mix of auction and set collection and is rather unique in that you're using your collections to bid.  I really like the feel of that.  Knowing that you could be breaking up a full set for a chance at a triplet or another full set is intriguing to me.  I like it a lot.  Quick fun.

You use your currency to bid for turn order and select from two piles in the middle or from other players. If you have less than 200 in a currency then subtract 100, but zero is the minimum. Three 20's or 30's of a currency give a 100 point bonus. Watch out for other players competing for the same currency. The iPad version is well done.

Two stacks of money cards are put on the table. Each player simultaneously chooses a number of money cards from his hand to play this round. The highest bidder chooses one of the stacks on the table or one of the bids of the other players until everyone has taken one stack. The goal is to collect sets of similar currencies.

Getting sets early by luck of the draw seems more important than player choices as the mechanism encourages spending money from sets not collected. The earlier a currency is cornered, the higher the likelihood to see more of it played. The simultaneous bidding raises the chaos factor. This filler, although clever, is not for me. Enough other better ones do not get played enough.

Fairly unique-feeling Knizia blind bidding game.  I enjoy the mechanism of taking from the central card piles or even your opponents' card offering.  I can't think of any other of his designs that feel similar.  It's very light and quick, but I'm convinced that more often than not, the better player will win.  It is amazing how by the end of the game each player has pretty much cornered a specific currency.

Excellent set collection game in which you seek to "exchange currency" in ways that will increase your score.  Complete sets of 20s and 30s (sets of 3) in a currency and earn 100 bonus points.  Earn 500 points for collecting the entire 9 cards of a currency.  Any currency in which you earn less than $100 you do NOT score.  If over $100 but under $200 in a type of currency, you subtract 100 from your total score in that currency (IE, if you collect $180 in US dollars, you earn only 80 points).  Earn 200  points in a currency, you keep the full amount for points.  Players put currency from their hand on the table and based on who has the most money offered, selects available currency sets from the board.

Despite his recent output, there's a reason Knizia has the reputation he has. When he was on, he was on, and it's amazing how many modern games still trace back to his designs. There's nothing to Money, it's a straight up auction and set-collection game, but the fact that you're bidding with what you're collecting turns the tables. There's almost no fluff (though there's some wonkiness; it is a Knizia design, after all) and the results are fast and frustrating. Glad to have finally played this one.

3-5p, 30m. Reiner Knizia auction/bidding with a currency-market theme.  Basically set collection, as you don't get to score a "currency" (suit) unless you have a minimum value, and there are "triplet bonuses" which doesn't really fit the theme, but adds strategy.
Seems more luck-driven than I like in an auction game.
Pretty light, with the end-game scoring a bit heavier than seems warranted.

This is another light Knizia filler that just didn't catch me. I think the thing that bothered me was the wacky scoring. The heavy penalty on not getting sets of 20s and 30s and not getting to 200 in a suit forces you to concentrate on one suit and at most two. The problem is you don't have nearly enough information or control to really concentrate on a given suit with any guarantee of success. This makes the game really feel like any number of the American card games I've played and didn't like. It's was my distaste for those card games that drove me into boardgames in the first place. Why would I want to go back with this game? I don't.

Essentially a set-collecting game, this is another very entertaining filler which bears repeated plays at one sitting. 

Use currencies in your hand to bid for other currencies on the table, or to take the bid hands of players who bid less than you. High bidder goes first. Collect 20s, 30s and currency runs for points.

Simple, no fluff - to paraphrase Sum 41, this is a filler that's all killer.

Great filler with fluid mechanics.  Players all blindly place a bid (using various demonitions of Money).  The highest bidder gets their choice of one of the two face up lots in the middle of the table or any of the other bids revealed by the other players.  You simply swich your bid with the denominations you chose.  Now, your denomitions can be chosen by the player with the second highest bid and so forth.  Players are trying to collect sets of the various denomitions.

Played once.  A neat set-collection game wherein the items you're collecting (types of currency) are the same items you must spend to get more items.  Adding to the complexity is that any currency you bid for an item can be picked up by any other player, making choice of bidding cards critical.  This played relatively quickly, even with five people, and was very enjoyable.  Definitely a good quick filler game.

A really clever card game from Knizia, in which players try to earn points buy acquiring certain currencies. Like many things Knizia, big points are earned by holding the majority of a currency at the end of a round. The twist here is that players bid for currency in the central pool with the currency they have...thus always changing the state of play and trying to outguess the opposition. 

Very happy to have this one.

Enjoyable auction game with an interesting set collection element. I could see some groups bringing the psychology of this game above the table, and negotiating what they bid in order to arrange trades and the like. The different forms of currency is appealing to me, and the balance between collecting cards of one type and trying to go all the way with them is very interesting. Why isn't it rated higher? Because I feel like the game drags on just a touch too long for my tastes.

An interesting and fun card game. It's sort of an auction game with a set collection element, but the auctions are wonky, since you may be able to take other player's bids or retract yours instead of taking one of the two lots you won. What starts to make the game interesting though is that you are bidding with the same commodities you are bidding on (and not just monetary equivalents to them), which leads to some very interesting choices. Sometimes it's easy to figure out what to do, but other times it can be very hard, since low-valued cards may be worth a lot of points, under the right circumstances. You also have an element where different players will put very different values on the lots based on what's in their hand, which leads to some interesting rounds (I think that could occur in a lot of auction games though). 

On the flip side to all of this, there are some elements that can be a little frustrating. The scoring is strange, but it's part of what makes the game work, so I won't complain too much about that. Also, it can be hard to determine a good value for the lots you're bidding on, though that will improve with experience, of course. The bigger problem is that because you are bidding with your cards, you sometimes do not have the right denomination to bid with. You may only have a 60 in your hand that is not part of a set that would score, for example, even if you would like to bid, say 30. These are not major complaints, though.

The mechanic is interesting, trading in a set of cards for another set and trying to trade up. Make too low a bid and you get the leftovers, make too high of a bid and you short change yourself.

RATING: 7
First impression (3 player) : It's a short card game where you're trying to collect sets of different currencies. Auction mechanic is pretty interesting as you collect cards but also use collected cards to gain new ones. There is always 2 piles of 4 cards and then players bid (play a pile of) cards themselves. There is then N+2 piles and the one who played highest valued pile of cards gets to swap one of them (even his own) with his pile and take them to his hand.

An ok closer. See what’s there, blind bid with the currencies you're not aiming to collect, everyone reveal, swap bid for the cards on offer, aiming to complete sets of currencies. Repeat until finished. Some decisions, but never seemingly key decisions. There’s a fair bit of luck involved - great if the currency(ies) you’re collecting comes out on just one side, bad if it comes out in dribs and drabs on either side of the fence at the same time. Also bad if someone's accidentally collecting what you're collecting because they're aren't many turns to successfully change course. In the end though, it’s just not that exciting.  There’s potential to watch what the others pick up and offload to play better, but that would interrupt the spirit of fast trading / fast money that the game tries to provide. At the end of the game, add up the scores ... and move on to something else more filling.

A game of collecting sets of currency, by bidding with and trading cards from your hand for other sets.  It plays quickly and is easy to learn.

Money is a set-collection card game in which players bid money cards of varying denominations and currencies in order to trade those cards bid for other sets of cards.  The player with the highest bid amount (regardless of currency type) gets first choice, and can either choose to exchange their bid with one of two four-card offers in the center, or another player's bid.  All players in descending bid order follow suit.  At the end of their game, players gain points for the face value of their money cards, but only if the total for a given currency type meets a certain (high) threshold.  Otherwise, players lose 10 points for any currency type that does not meet the threshold.  Personally, I didn't much enjoy this exercise, as it's very hard to focus on more than one currency (at least in 5-player), the scoring system leads to lots of ties at the end, and it seems easy to get screwed over on the last round.

It does nudge slightly out of the filler category in our group as it takes us more like an hour to play a game.

You are trying to make large sets of same-type money. Each turn players place a bid for cards using the cards in their hand. If a player has high bid they get first selection of the face up piles including other players bids. The cards just swap or players can keep the hand they put down. 

It was neat and some interesting decisions but I won't request it in the future. Simple but easy to play.

A filler card game by Knizia. It is a simple Rummy variant with little decision making involved. You always take the set of cards that best match one or two types of currency cards (suits) in your hand. The blind bidding part adds only a tiny bit to the game. I think replayability is pretty low.

An enjoyable filler, the cards which are various currencies looks good and adds to the enjoyment.
The scoring strengthens the set collection theme, you have to focus on certain currencies.
It has a different flavor of auction where you bid to get dibs on the sets of currency on display. Your bid replaces what you take and is available for later bidders. This allows the currency to flow among the players.

This is definetly a four, according to what the lsit says a four is: Not so good, doesn't get me, but could be talked into it. Likely won't play it again. To my mind, too much depends on the first deal (and I've been at the + end as well as the - end). If you get really high denomination cards on the first deal, you're more likely to win the bidding, which gets you more cards, worth more, and you can bid high again next round. IF your first deal sucks, you're stuck with getting whatever is leftover during the bidding process, which usually isn't much, so you can't bid high...you're either on an upward spiral or a downward one. So no, I won't likely play it again. I could be talked into it only if someone really loved it, and had no one else to play with and I felt bad for them. 'Cause I am essentially a marshmallow when someone asks nicely.

The cards are nice, that's for sure. The gameplay is not fun, kinda frustrating since you have to collect money but on the other hand you have to bid with your collected money. Scoring is too mathy for a filler and the point swings between players can be huge. Supposed to be a fun filler but it clearly isn't.

RATING: 6.5
A relatively simple but challenging card game suitable for all abilities. This is an early game by Knizia and like many of his early games (such as Samurai) it remains a little unpolished.
Players have hands of money, they use them to bid for other piles of money on the table. The objective is to accumulate money in the same currencies, which score points at the end of the game. The mechanics are challenging though there is a fair amount of luck involved. On the upside it plays very quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I wasn't at all impressed with this. The "theme" is dull as ditchwater, which shouldn't really make a difference, but actually does to me even though it's a pasted-on Knizia one. And the gameplay is no more interesting than the theme, sadly.

fast and decent amount of thinking.  belongs in the same class as 'for sale', which i like more.  the joys are the beautiful cards, which resemble very well currencies from around the world (complete with serial numbers that have a function in the game!), the guessing of how much others will bid, figuring out what you can get rid of in your hand, and how much you want from what's on the table.  on the minus side, there's a 50/50 chance that you're bidding on something completely unknown, the game has absoletly no relationship  with actual money or currency or anything else. but it's a quick game, and for such a quick game, it lets you think quite a bit.  very few games like that.

The mechanisms in this one come together in a fun way that feels different from other fillers.  A card determines initiative and has to be traded. Everything comes at a cost and you do have to try and play the other players at the same times.

Round after round of repetitive bidding. There's a significant memory element to it as you observe which currencies and values your opponents have picked up. But the luck of what gets thrown out and kept for whatever reason feels silly even when you're benefiting greatly from it. So a win doesn't feel like an accomplishment so much as a gift handed to you. Sure, there's good bids and bad ones, but it's such a dry affair you can find yourself not caring and still winning.

Who doesn't want to spend money to gain more money? The Lost Cities-like scoring system introduces agonizing choices on which cards to keep in hopes of collecting sets and which to throw away as a bid. The annoying thing is you need to keep track of your opponents' cards.

I bought this for my wife because she liked the way it looked.  I was very pleased with the result.  I like the tension between bidding for new cards and trying to keep stuff in your hand to score with as well as trying to keep certain cards away from your opponents.  As usual with many Knizia games, the scoring can be convoluted.  Still it is a real pleasure to play.  wish I could play more.

2017: 7. Recently played "For Sale".  For quick playing auction filler card games, that might be the one to beat.  Something about "Money" feels a little odd while "For Sale" is so straight forward by comparison, and way funnier.

This is a fun filler.  I'm not sure how deep the choices are, but it is a lively way to kill time.  Another example of a game that says to play multiple rounds where only one is necessary.  There is nothing wrong with short filler.  Designers and publishers need to feel fine with this.  If there were elements of the game that were relevant from round to round, I would understand it, but one is enough.  If I want to play another game, I will (and I would the game is good).

Set-collection, simultaneous bidding. Pretty good filler, although it can be very frustrating when you just can't get what you need to complete your set! Also, a bit painful if people take too long figuring out what to bid.

Gryphon Edition:
- the cards are ridiculously large!
- nice artwork on the backs
- but same less-than-ideal (China-printed) quality cards: a bit flimsy, and cut such that the edges curve enough to stick to other cards, making it difficult to fan them apart.

I prefer the original small-box version!

--- Summary ---
Cards are in several currencies (3 x 20, 3 x 30, 40, 50, 60) and krugerand (10 each). Everyone starts with 6 cards in hand, plus a dummy bid card. Make 2 face up groups of 4 cards. Everyone uses cards to bid simultaneously; ties broken by serial number on money (lowest goes first). Return dummy cards back to your hand. In order from high-bid to low (but not 0; ties broken by lowest serial number on cards bid), players add a group of cards (any face up group on the table) to their hand, replacing those cards with their bid. If you take someone else's bid cards, they go immediately (they now have the highest bid). There will be 2 groups left on the table -- add enough cards from the deck to bring each group to 4 cards.

The last round is when the draw deck is emptied. Score sets of like currencies where value = sum of values  + (100 for each set of 3 20s or 3 30s). If this value is less than 200, deduct 100.

Play 3 times through the deck, adding scores from each round. High score wins.

RATING: 5
Money is decent but not better than that.  I would play again because it's fast, but unfortunately it is plagued by some issues which will keep it off our table.  Primarily the player interaction is not strong--this is due to the combination of it being a blind bidding game and the sets you're collecting are hidden information, so there's simply not a lot of table talk, and there's no typical Blind Bidding game talk to get people to bid more to slow a leader--chances are you don't know who the leader is!

Blind bidding where all the players are going to be spending the entirety of their bid adds a huge hunk of random for no real purpose--you're not bidding based on the value of the item because the value must be determined by the market (which is unknown since the bidding is blind).  It's not until later in the game if you are tracking the 8 or 9 suits, that you may be able to come up with a relative value.  otherwise you are simply bidding as high as possible to attain something you think you really want.

I like the mechanic of having to bid with the same things you are collecting, but Knizia explored this much better in Katzenjammer Blues, which has a real auction as well as only 1s through 5s to track.

[Goldsieber 1999 edition] {trading, set-collection; optimal 4p} Money! is a nice trading filler. It's portable, interactive, tactical and fast-paced.  Knizia has designed another nice tactical card game.

Luck is not important.  Players can have meaningful decisions. A player has to decide wisely which currency to collect and how to maintain a good cash flow.  In general, the gold cards are not as useful as other currencies; there is no need to intentionally collect the gold cards unless to build up cash flow.   It can be played aggressive or casually; with aggressive play, players can pay attention to what other players are collecting and destroy their plan or make use of their plan.

The illustration of cards is uninspiring.  The rulebook is informative and well illustrated, though.

[FRED edition]  Com' on! This edition is just too expensive!  I got my Goldsieber edition with only USD7!

An odd little currency speculation game (who am I kidding? It's just set collection!) that I quite like, but it seemed on one play to end with pretty similar scores. I set out to collect all of one set, missed by one card (which the player who'd played before had kept back), only to see someone else manage a full set and the experienced player make a full set, plus some 10 point card bonuses for the win.

It's not an exciting game, but it is fairly clever.

If you want to knock Knizia games for being all about math, this would be exhibit "A."

I do like how sometimes you need to buy lots of junk just to fuel future bids though.

I found myself thinking of Battleline when I was playing this.

I love Battleline because it plays quickly and has a lot of tension in deciding when to fully commit.  It also gets good marks for portability.

I like Money for all of the same reasons, but it is a full step below Battleline in the tension department.  In Battleline it really is impossible to switch horses in midstream when you've decided to go in a certain direction on a flag.  

In Money, it is possible to flip which currencies you're going for.  This is not always wise, but possible.  While that would make it seem like there was more choice and, therefore, a better game, it works in the opposite way.  One has many decent choices so there is no anguish over what to do.  Plus, you are not sure how you are doing relative to your opponents so this also makes it easier to "just pick something".

I am not saying there is no tension in the game.  There is and it is a short game so I do enjoy it. 

Not for nothing, but if the theme was less unique (Court of Medici) or the cards were not as nice as these (Agora), then there is a good chance I would not play this.  These things matter to me and there is a lot to be said for exploring unique themes and making sure the bits are pleasing. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 4

It was a very weird first game.

In this game, the players are competing to get money in 7 differents currencies. Every currency has 9 cards (3x 20, 3x 30, 40, 50 and 60). The players bet cards in hand to trade them for other cards (or for one of the 2 central rows or for what someone else bid). This goes on until the draw deck is empty. The final score is:

- Less than 200 in one currency: take 100 of the value, what is left is your points in this currency (no negative);
- 200 or more: you get the full points;
- For every set of three 20ies or 30ies, you get 100 bonus points;
- The coins cards (there are 6 of them) are worth 10 points each.

The player with the most points wins.

In our match, all the players went head on for only one currency, and by the end of the game, 3 of the 5 players had all the cards of the currency. So, it was a three-way tie - all of them with 500 points. And the other 2 was only one card away to complete the set also, which would mean a total tie. The tiebreaker is: play one or more games and add the results - maybe this is the way to go, but not if we continued with the ties.

Is this usual? I guess that, being the first game of everyone, it was easier to focus on only one currency, and that, with more plays under everyone belts, we will get wiser, watching more closely to what others are taking and, thus, denying them important cards while trying to get not only enough to reach 200 of one currency, but also vying to make sets of 20ies and 30ies.

The taste of this first game was a bit sour. But the game is fast enough and the mechanics interesting and not quite like anything else in our group library of games, so new games will come.

5 after one play. Seems really random/chaotic. It's really unclear what I'm going to get for my offer.

I do think it's interesting that the "junk" cards you're not planning on scoring on are still valuable; if you have nothing but valuable cards you'll have to part with one in an effort to get more junk to bid with.

This is short and sweet and a good game for playing while waiting for food at a restaurant. I would be interested in getting this. I think I could convince people to play with me.

Like the auction type mechanics and the replicas of the currency makes it more interesting than just getting commodities.

Played iPad version. Not too bad for a filler. Another knizia variant for a very mathy kin a game. Excellent short term filler. This is probably not too high on my list of wants even though it is Knizia. The game is a tad bit too chaotic for my tastes. Sure, you get to decide how much to bid, but you still can't tell what other folks are bidding.

There can be a balance between trying to corner the market in a single currency or trying to make smaller successes in several.  I am mindful of once losing a hand despite having captured a majority while an opponent simply had more cards in total even though showing more diversity.  I was prompted to attempt a different bidding strategy in rounds that followed.

Another clever Knizia game, but traded away because the simple but repetitive arithmetic was annoying. Have played both Goldsieber and Gryphon editions - both of them are attractive, I personally don't see the need for the larger box.

I found this game to very entertaining. Simple but not simplistic. Scoring is key in this game! Like the design elements though, I did have a slightly confused player on the initial play. 
The key here to avoiding AP is to have people who take it for what is: a card game while luck and strategy play equal parts. Very good.

A great Knizian filler.  Although I call it a "filler" there is more here than meets the eye.  Once players have an idea of how the points work bidding gets tricky.  The theme works wonderfully, nifty little game.

It takes money to make money, the old saying goes, and that's nowhere clearer than right here in this little game.  It's unassuming, and pretends to be a filler, but this is a filler with teeth that gives you choices to make, some of them agonizingly so.  Knowing who's collecting which cards, and which ones they've taken that they probably don't want, is a big part of the game, since you want to be able to make offers that they want, giving you the chance to take something that can help you.  It's a neat game, with some neat mechanisms, and it plays in under half an hour.  What more do you need?

Unsuprisingly this had a theme that couldn't miss with Gwen... trading Money for more Money!  This is a very nice twist on traditional set collecting and I love how in addition to the blind bid, every bid on the table is fair game when its your turn to take something.

The only interesting aspect about this set collection card game (is it just me or are there way too many iteration of this genre) is the variation on how scoring is accomplished.  The bluffing mechanism seem superfluous rather than useful.  Average filler for occasional plays.

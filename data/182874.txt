Thoroughly enjoyed the game, so many things to juggle and a great dice drafting mechanism which I hope to see again in other games.  Didn't mind the AP downtime despite the 3-player game lasting about 3 hours.

Our only negative was the unnecessarily tiny, italic handwritten-style font for the job names on the staff cards, in German only.  Very challenging to decipher.

A uniquely themed game about managing the "best" Austrian hotel, it plays 2-4 (but really only scales well for 2), is easy to learn and play, and has a high replayability factor.

The game lasts over 7 rounds, where each round you have the option of drafting a guest for your hotel (you have 3 "slots" or tables to seat them outside in your café), and these guests order a dish, so you must satisfy the order, and have an available prepared room waiting for them.  If you do, you may move them into the room and receive a one time bonus and points, as well as points at the end of the game for an occupied room.  A nice feature of this game is that every guest card (and helper card) is unique.

The next part of your turn is that you select an action which are generated each round through die rolls (similar to Yspahan, Kingsburg, Bora Bora, etc.).  The different options are: 1) collect strudel and/or cake (brown and/or white cubes, needed to fulfill orders), 2) collect wine and/or coffee (red and/or black cubes, needed to fulfill orders), 3) prepare more rooms (these need to be connected to previous rooms, they come in 3 flavours (red, blue, yellow), and you get bonuses for completing/closing/occupying regions of rooms similar to Castles of Burgundy), however this does cost money and money is TIGHT in this game, 4) collect money and/or move up on the Emperor track, 5) play a helper card (unique cards with abilities similar to occupations in Agricola) at a monetary discount, 6) your option, but you must pay a dollar for the priviledge.  You also have the option of passing your turn, and when it is next your turn, you remove 1 die and re-roll the remaining die.
  
After your first action, you must wait as turns proceed Catan setup style or snake; this is why this game is basically a 2 player only game due to added downtime but nothing else with more players).  Also, every turn you have the option of doing "free"/extra actions and these are: 1) pay $1 to add a virtual die to your chosen action to beef it up, 2) move a completed guest to their room, 3) move up to three goods from your kitchen to guests orders for $1, 4) complete a politics card, which are end game points scored for meeting variable in game conditions.  At 3 intervals during the game, there will be an Emperor's visit and he is a jerk, as he rewards those who have made an effort to gain his favour, but he heavily punishes those who did not, plus he always pushes you down after his visit, making it difficult to regain favour the next time.  Most points win, and there's a lot of ways to gain points, including: Emperor track, helper cards that provide end game bonuses, politics cards, completed guests scored in game, occupied rooms all score points, completed sections of blue rooms score points as their bonus, and any leftover cash and/or foods.

This game sounds like a real keeper, and to some extent it is, I've generally enjoyed my plays of it, and it has that "want to play again" feel to it.  The problems are: 1) the cost is prohibitive, it's part of Mayfair's price their customers out of the market plan, 2) the downtime is unacceptable for more than 2 players, which leads to 3) this is a light game, but it takes quite a bit of time, and really people shouldn't overplan and have AP, due to the lightness (die rolling, variable card draws, relatively simple gameplay).  I think with a bit more development it would have been amazing, and it certainly looks like a game wide-open for expansions.

I enjoyed this one. It has some interesting decisions, but feels to me at least imbalanced? Not that there is mistake in the design, but that certain aspects seem more important to others - almost to the point of exclusion of other portions of the design. There is a level of frustration as well with the display of cards that can very much disturb your longer strategic plans. Having said that, it is overall an interesting design, but not one that I believe needs to be in my collection.

RATING: 7
You look at Grand Austria Hotel and you think that here we have yet another euro cube pusher. Well, that does not miss the mark completely but does not do justice to the game either.

What Grand Austria Hotel does well is that you get a really satisfactory feeling from creating some really powerful combos, and there is a lot of this. You actually feel that you have accomplished something. I also liked the dice mechanics to determine the actions available. However, it also reduced some tension you normally find in the action selection/worker placement because the same action are still available to the next players. They just gradually get slightly less powerful every time they get picked. So I didn't have a feeling that there were any really crucial denials. Since the player interaction is of indirect type, this lessens it even further. But this is not to say that you can forget about the other players completely. You just do not have to be super worried.

The game can induce rather heavy analysis paralysis but this is mitigated by the dice and random customer cards that together create a boundary to the horizon how far ahead you can actually plan your moves. In my opinion this worked really well since I did find myself getting lost in an endlessly branching event tree. You only needed to evaluate a few courses of action and make a decision. At least I felt that the decisions I made were all significant, which is a big plus.

My only bigger complaint is about the length. Beating the same egg for seven rounds (14 actions) is a bit too long IMHO. I had a feeling that the last two rounds did not really add to experience. Of course, you had your hotel almost full which made some customers much less attractive and influenced your decision making, but still this could have happened a round or two earlier.

Grand Austria Hotel is a good game, just a bit long, at least with four.

It started out pretty darned good: great dice drafting, some engine building...but then it started getting tedious.  None of our engines really felt worthwhile, bad die rolls couldn't be mitigated THAT much, and the game was just feeling...long.  We were [i]constantly[/i] referring to the rulebook for icons, and it never let up.  Pretty well-designed, but obtuse.  -1 point for allowing 4 players to play together.  The downtime is absolutely BRUTAL with the turn order mechanic and 4 players.

This is my kind of euro.  Different paths to victory, many options, some push/pull for which direction to go, and the theme ties to the mechanics very nicely.

The Catch:  Never, never, NEVER play this at 4.  This is a 2 or 3-player game.  It's surprisingly tight at those numbers and, while the downtime remains relatively high, at least it's one player shorter.

I played a 2-player game of this so far.  I'd like to play it more at 2 and/or 3.  Too bad the majority of game nights I attend are 4 and 5 players.  Ah well.

Not a bad game; just not a great one, either. Pretty well-themed for a euro, but the art is ludicrous at times; and why are the names of the staff written in such tiny font? The rulebook is well done, apart from some vagueness about icons. It flirts with being multiplayer solitaire, but doesn't quite cross that frontier.

I like the shifting turn-order mechanic which forces players to adjust their tactics (but not their strategy) each turn. The Emperor track is both a blessing and a curse, depending on how well you're doing! If you're lagging behind in VP, it's a nice catch-up mechanism; if you're doing well, it's a dark shadow that you can only ignore to your peril (unless you're light years ahead of everyone else). 

All in all, not anywhere near as good as Signor Luciani's Voyages of Marco Polo; nor as good as Macao with which, for some incomprehensible reason, it's often compared.

Juego con mecánicas sencillas y bien integradas: gestión de mazo, gestión de recursos, combos, control de áreas... en este juego lo de menos son los dados. No sientes en ningún momento que el azar tenga un papel importante. Lo que menos me gusta es el sistema que utilizan para la gestión de los turnos que pueden hacerse muy largos.

truly multiplayer solitaire, and some real luck in which cards you get, but still scratches that dicey euro itch real well.

Very tight game in which you get only 14 drafting actions, but can combo things together nicely in a way that feels pretty satisfying. Drafting the helper cards is essential. Symbology is a bit confusing at first (and the rulebook lays the explanations out in a very annoying manner) but becomes intuitive after a play.

Lots of different angles in this game. I love the dice mechanism, which can make games very different from each other. The artwork gives me a nice feel, and the theme is solid. I think it plays 2 or 3 better than 4, however. I find the iconography a bit confusing, and I am not convinced how much the staff cards add to the game.

A typical modern efficiency game with several systems thrown together and multiple ways to score. There is a certain charm in little resource cubes representing strudel and cake rather than wood and cloth, and in filling slots in your player board with customers (who bring special abilities) rather than buildings. At least Grand Austria Hotel is not as inscrutable as, say, La Granja.

The artwork is quite jolly and production quality is good. My one complaint is with the tiny scrawled names on the servant cards. The English rules are well done.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
Hoo boy, Jimmy likes his dice drafting! Visiting again in the world of Klemens Franz' excellent and charming artwork, we find ourselves as posh hoteliers in imperial Austria at the turn of the century. Attract wealthy clientele to your cafe, grab dice to fulfill food and drink orders, prepare rooms, impress the Emperor, and hire staff. Once you complete your customers' orders, they'll reward you handsomely with points, cash, and heaps of other bonuses. 

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
You get fourteen actions, but with a bit of combinatorial insanity, you can do a whole lot more than that. "Okay, for one action, I'll pay one dollar to take three sixes, grabbing two strudel and a cake. I'll give Frau Blucher the two strudel and cake, which completes her order, which fills this yellow room, with completes this yellow block, which affords me with six points on the Emperor track, pushing me over ten prestige, which allows me to claim the fifteen-point Emperor objective. She also gives me seven points, two bucks, and a free glass of wine, which I'll place directly on Brother Uwe's order. Oh, that completes his order, too. I'll plop him in this red room, which, oh!, completes this red block, so I get ten bucks for free, and a few points, and I get to hire staff for less thanks to my client's bonus..."

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
You really need to draft the staff cards in this game. Some score, some don't. Guess who wins? The player who is blindly dealt all of the scoring cards. Yeah, seriously, draft those suckers.

This is a nicely designed euro, with all the fun bells and whistles that one would expect in a euro.   Let' see... 

Acquire cards that require resource cubes. Check. Acquire resource cubes to fulfill cards. Yep. Once you fulfill the cards, something good happens, in this case, immediately. Yes, love those card effects.  Have a board, in this case, your own individual board, with a spatial challenge that as you complete the spatial challenge, good things happen. Got it. Have common goals that have a "race to get there first" aspect. Yep.  

And, as per the present euro design trend, introduce asymmetrical advantages such that each player can "break the rules" in some fashion, tap powerful cards, get super one time effects, and ideally, string together satisfying card combos. Yes!

And drive the game with a nice worker placement variant, here using dice, in what I found to be a reasonably clever and satisfying way.

I liked Grand Austria Hotel, even if perhaps, the game lacked a certain novelty or pizzaz for my (jaded?) tastes.  I enjoyed the theme, and the use of the dice, including the re-roll mechanism.  

After the first play, I do have some reservations about the way turns are handled in the game.  Our three player game seemed okay, but being the player with the 3-4 capability felt SO much better than than having the 1-6.   

I do worry about a four player game which would necessitate the use of the 1-8.   After you finish going first, you are likely to experience a lot of down time with the inability to really plan, since the dice and the customers will change so much by the time you get to the 8, or final turn. 

Lastly, is there sufficient player interaction in this game?  Perhaps, it is best to compare Grand Austria Hotel to the celebrated Castles of Burgundy where the fun of the shopping, combos, completions, and points scored (and Grand adds fun asymmetrical powers) compensates for the fact that everyone is essentially doing their own thing in the game.  As in Castles of Burgundy, perhaps advanced play suggests that players strategically take things (here customers or dice) that others need for their engines.

A game that will probably provide something for everyone, but also feels fairly flawed.

I've seen people ask for comparisons between GAH and Troyes regularly be met with "I don't think they're to be directly compared."  I disagree.  GAH feels like a more slanted, less refined version of Troyes.  It offers you an enjoyable personal player board, and asks you to scramble for a dozen different things at a time while removing the far shorter downtime and direct player interaction.  Both games are definitely points salads, and both games offer you a good degree of combo potential for huge turns.
A singular point of differentiation - GAH probably offers a better 2-player experience simply because it has more for you to do and doesn't depend on the other players like Troyes does.  Troyes will work much better at 4 because it has more consistent engagement between players.

CAUTION: DO NOT PLAY WITH FOUR PLAYERS

Overall Grand Austria Hotel was a fun little point salad game by using a dice pool.

Pros:
- Interesting dice pool actions and flexibility to add a dice to the pool (while taking a penalty)
- Fun to build engine with the cards that you play on the table

Cons:
- Significant down time if you are the start player since it is snake order, you could wait 6 actions before you go again.  In our game that meant sometimes waiting 10 minutes between actions.

Euro melange that distinguishes itself a bit by positively incorporating a press-your-luck element into the game in a meaningful and not particularly swingy way. Single play with 3P which maybe wore out its welcome a bit, which makes 4P seem unfathomable to me. May be best with 2P, as the BGG page suggests. Biggest knock, by far, is the iconography and text. Despite looking great, it features a ghastly amount of opaque language-neutral icons, and even German text written in tiny horrible fonts to boot. Still worth trying if you're into pick-up cube mashups, because the game itself is really superior in that genre.

RATING: 6.5
Have greatly enjoyed this game from my first play, but subsequent plays and browsing the Rules subforum have revealed issues that detract the game in both large and small ways (in no particular order):

1) Poor font choice—no objection to use of German, huge objection to a font that makes reading difficult for non-German-speakers.

2) Certain guest cards have icons on them that aren't explained in the rules; it's only when looking at the icon explanations for Emperor-scoring tiles that these make sense.

3) Still waiting, as of 2016-Jan, for an official answer as to [thread=1503458]whether the guest discard pile should be reshuffled[/thread] if the deck runs out—it's already happened twice in a dozen plays.

4) As to whether additional actions are truly permitted anytime on one's turns, the rulebook is unclear, and the [article=20633818]publisher's ruling[/article] was later [article=25054094]contradicted by the designer[/article] 16 months after the fact—and no update appears to have been issued by the publisher to correct their initial ruling.  Between this and 3) above, there's a disappointing level of support for this game.

5) The scoreboard wraps at 75 instead of a multiple of 10—there's a reason that the metric system works, but apparently that's not good enough for this game.

6) One of the designers has [article=20940620]ruled that there's a hard cap[/article] on the Telefonistin (Operator) staff card, despite the fact that the "rule" being quoted is in the rulebook's advice-bubble format.  Apparently "26 points with only 1 card is too much!" in a very narrow set of circumstances, while the Direktor (Hotel Manager) could max out at 24 points in far broader circumstances.

7) It's cool that while 13 is a hard limit on Emperor points, any that would be gained in excess of the cap "spill over" into immediate victory points.  Yet [article=20832095]20 krone is a hard cap[/article] that somehow doesn't warrant the same "spillover" feature—even though leftover krone convert to VP at the end of the game.  I respect the designers' prerogative to create whatever game they wish; my prerogative as a player means I'm free to observe certain rules inconsistent.

8) The rules as written imply that guest's rewards are not optional ("You can move a guest whose order you completed to a free room. You immediately receive the printed number of Victory Points and the reward that guest provides." –p.8), but, sure enough, one of the designers has [article=20858375]overridden[/article] this, and yet has not clarified whether the rewards, if taken, must be taken in full or may be taken piecemeal.

Overall, I wish the designers and publishers took this game as seriously as its fans do, as it's got a fantastic core that is impaired by poor presentations and rulings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a solid dice drafting/manipulation game that feels quite puzzly, as players attempt to find the most efficient way to score VP. (1) First, because of the dice-drafting and numerous options players have, the game doesn't feel luck driven. (2) Secondly, the game manages to offer players a wide breathe of tactical and strategic choices. (3) And because of the varied ways players can score VP, there always seems to be numerous viable options. The end result is something that feels generic, but also polished, brain-burning and fun. 

That being said, this isn't a game I would want to play with 3-4 players. While each player only has 14 actions during the entire game, the turn-order can translate into long breaks between turns (First player goes first and last). And even with 2-players, I found certain turns going slow as players attempted to sort through all their options. But other than that, I found the entire game quite enjoyable. 

[Update]: With 7 plays, I'm increasing my rating to a 9. Overall, I do think the luck-element can't be entirely mitigated. And if this was a longer game, that would probably bother me. But with 2-players, the game takes 30-45 minutes, provides a very fluid experience, and the randomness largely adds to the puzzle. It's one of those games that I can play over and over again without boredom.

Is the game perfect? Probably not. For one, I think this is a 2-player only game as explained above. Secondly, Mayfair should have included numbers/letters on the staff cards so they could be referenced quickly.  With the number of different/odd staff cards, this is the type of game where players are going to be looking them up... and it isn't easy to do so. I'm a bit bewildered that Mayfair didn't see this issue beforehand. But this is Mayfair and if they didn't drop the ball somewhere along the production... it just wouldn't have that Mayfair quality that we're all accustomed to =p.

Nem nagyon kerestem, csak úgy szembejött. Nos, nem vagyok elájulva tőle, de van ami tetszik benne.
Ami rossz: először is az ikonrendszer béna, ráment a 3+ órás parti (3 fő), mire megszoktuk. A szabályban kell bogarászni az embereket egyenként, néhányat meg se találtunk. Vagy mi voltunk amatőrök, vagy a készítők, de ez a része nem tetszett:) Másfelől kicsit körülményesnek éreztem az egészet, nem hengerelt le elegáns letisztultsággal. És sok a holtidő már így 3-an is. 1-6-tal, főleg ha passzal indítok, simán 15-20 perc szünet:).
Ami kifejezetten tetszett, az a passz megoldás, meg a főakció választás, kicsit yspahanos, de azért nem pont ugyanaz. Összességében nem rossz, de nem értem így utólag, miért volt ez az egyik legfelkapottabb játék a '15-ös Essen után. Ennél jobb játékok is eltűnek pár év alatt a süllyesztőben, persze messzire vezet, hogy ennek mi az oka, de a lényeg, hogy ez nálam távolról sincs a legjobbak közt. Kaphat azért még egy lehetőséget, bízom benne, hogy csak a nehéz kaja miatt volt ilyen felemás az élmény:).

RATING: 6
The dice-based strength of the selected action feels satisfying. I may like it more than Troyes's version of it. In addition, the dice-based mechanisms add a decent layer of tactical decision making. At two players, the removal of a die at each turn doesn't feel too chaotic, so any planning you performed during the down time between turns isn't wasted. Add in the customer card drafting, tableau building, variable scoring tiles and variable punishment tiles, and you left with an engaging strategy game that can be re-played many, many times. The scoring tiles and punishment tiles are key towards each game playing differently.

I'm still unsure, however, as to how much I like the game. I do want to play again after finishing, so that's a good sign. But the additional randomness of the staff cards doesn't feel right. You typically see less than 10 staff cards as you play and each staff card's strength varies greatly. Further, some staff cards synergize better with the scoring tiles or customer cards than others. This can lead to the appearance of imbalance. This type of input randomness worked well in Agricola, but that was one of the few ways in which Agricola injected input randomness. There are many additional variable inputs in Grand Austria Hotel. The appearance of luck is the root of my uneasy feeling regarding the staff cards in Grand Austria Hotel. You could draft the staff cards in an attempt to minimize the luck, but  drafting adds time to a game that, without drafting, is nearly pushing its welcome for 2 or 3 players. 

The theme, while pleasant and a good change of pace, is laughable at parts (e.g., converting the restaurant patrons to hotel patrons). The staff hiring, outside of my dislike for what it adds to the game, is conceptually fun.

Edit, Sept 2017: So this game is marketed at supporting 4 players, but never should have been. This game is best at 2 players and passable at times at 3. This will probably only get played as a 2 player game moving forward however.  As a pleasant 2 player game, this gets rated at a 7, which is then downgraded to a 6.5 as a hedge for my issues with the staff cards. At 3 players, this gets rated at somewhere between a 5 and a 6. At 4 players this gets rated at a 1 or 2. Since this mainly competes with Castles of Burgundy for playtime and I've rated Castles based on its 2 player experience, I will keep this at a 6.5.

Update, Dec 2017: My issue with the cards--or at least how the cards mix with all the other randomized elements--has not gone away. I won't spend time card drafting to somewhat fix the issue either. Downgrading.

Wow, dit krijgt een hoge score op bgg, die ik zelf minder kan delen.  Nochtans ben ik meestal gul in mijn score.
De dobbelstenen bepalen voor een groot deel wat je moet doen.  Je kan niet zelf je strategie uitdokteren, maar bent afhankelijk van wat er op bord ligt, in je hand komt, en vooral: wat er gedobbeld wordt.
Dat kan frustrerend zijn.
Misschien nog wachten op een 2e speelbeurt voor een def score.
--> OK, nog eentje gezakt, omdat ik het met 3 spelers al te veel downtime vond.  Er gebeurt ook te veel vooraleer het weer aan jouw beurt is, zodat je niet kan anticiperen.

I have a thing for Euro games with clever usage of dice. Core mechanics of this game is dice drafting which I absolutely love. This is one of the more thematic Euro games, building a Hotel empire which appeals to me. This game is not particularly heavy but it's a lot of fun with all the crazy combos you can pull off, reminds me slightly of Castles of Burgundy. It plays excellently and very fast for two players which is another pro for me.

A nice Euro that makes good use of dice. Obviously it's part of what makes the tension here, but two more rounds would really be nice, at least in a two player game. But maybe I just wanted to play a little bit longer. With two, 90 minutes is a sure overestimate. (Update July 2017: Don't ever play this game with 4.)

Another 2 player run at one of my unplayed games. GAH is a dice activation game where you need to get guests into rooms of your hotel. You do this by opening rooms, hiring staff, and tempting those guests with your yummy food (i.e., cubes). This one was fairly heavy. There was a huge VP swing in the midgame as Brian claimed two of the goal cards and got 30 extra VP. I liked this game and will play it again, but I would probably not suggest it. It seems like you can really get screwed over by the dice and not be able to catch up. I will hold onto this for a little bit and see if my opinion of it increases.

This game reminded me of castles of burgandy. Its a very good game where planning is key to victory. There are some push your luck mechanics that allow you to try to aim for a planned path. But the there is a fair amount of randomness in the offers where you draft cards and dice so you cant always do exactly what you want but have to adapt. The game is no point sallad, you can get punished. The theme is very well implemented and you really understand why some guest gives you some benefits and why some staff do what they do. The deployability is very high and the designers have done a great job including cards that can boost a multiple different strategies. The game has a resource converting mechanic with a 3 step process of getting roms booked. First get the guest, then serve the guest refreshments and then let him check in to a room. So you get cubes (food and drinks), room tiles (in 3 colors), and guest cards. What makes the game fun is that you get many many options, money and actions are tight so you have to optimize, planning for end game scores, variable setup. The game plays great on 2. The game looks lighter than what it is, and has game weight slightly above castles of burgundy or Marco Polo.

An engaging dice drafting, card combo, recipe filling game, but becomes insufferable because of the downtime if played with four players. Plays best at two, with three having some downtime. 

The interesting take of the game is trying to combo your cards with your actions to maximize efficiency. Other than that, it's standard Euro-fare.

It's a bit muti-player solitaire with the player interaction being the negation of dice and being the first to complete objectives for better points.

Still, an enjoyable experience with the right player count.

The biggest complaint I've heard about this game is the downtime. I didn't experience that in our 3 player game with gamers who were moving quickly. The snaking turn order is part of what leads to this. But for gamers, it's a fast-moving dice-rolling Euro game that I found moved right along at the right place. I'd play it again though I'm not itching to do so.

Played a couple of times and this is really enjoyable. Tight with some really tough decisions.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This game has a ton of good stuff going for it.  I really like how many different options there are for goals.  I also really enjoy the dice allocation aspect, and how the different rolls can really make the tactical / strategic choices tough.  I thought I would like this one going in, but I actually REALLY liked it after playing it.  It's very rare that a game exceeds my exceptions when I already think I will like it, but this game for sure did.  One I would like to play much more of!

This is a very fun dice drafting game. It hovers near the edge of having too many mechanisms going at once, but just stays shy of that and delivers a smooth playing solid Euro. The tactical puzzle of trying to complete everything in time, manage your rooms, manage your guests, deal with a very tight money situation, select special powers, etc. all leads to a wonderful gaming experience. Note that there is a luck elements and sometimes the dice and customers that come out just work better for another player. This has frustrated my wife on a few occasions, but we still really enjoy the game.

After 2 plays of this game and highly enjoying both I decided I needed to get a copy for myself.

Some good strategy there in figuring out if you should pass or not.

Not so great with four players. The game mechanics scale fine with four players, but there's too much downtime between turns and no interaction to keep you involved.

Played twice with three players now, and while the game went somewhat faster, there's too much waiting for my taste. It's a pity because I like the kind of decision making during your own turn very much. Setting up sequences of combos and when it all falls into place it's a very satisfying feeling.

The designer hasn't topped Tzolk'in yet.

RATING: 8
Really like this but I'm not sure I can say why.  

First off, it's mostly MPS.  You could take dice or customers just because someone else needs them, but with only 14 actions all game, I can't see doing that before the last round assuming you've got nothing else useful to do.  

Second off, there's lots of replayability.  End game goals, in game goals, helper cards, customers and player boards are different every game so there's lots of variability.  However, I'm not sure after one play whether it will "feel" different between plays.  

It feels like so many other, gets cubes to complete orders and use helper cards (and completed order cards) to make actions more efficient.  That said, rules are easy to understand and game play is smooth.  

Other people have complained about downtime, but I didn't see it.  I could definitely see it, but in our game, there wasn't too much downtime.  When you're going first and last I could see a potential issue and I'd probably not play this at my FLGS on game night, but at home, it worked fine.

So, in the end, this should only rate a 6 or 7 for me.  After several more plays it might drop to that, but after one play, it's an 8.  Blame CotN or the publisher (Lookout) but I really enjoyed my play.  And Amanda and Stella really liked it too (both rated it an 8).

Very good for a medium weight and medium length game. 

Typical point grab salad, multiplayer solitaire with minimal player interaction. But nevertheless, it's quite a decent one at that. More innovative things to do with dice.

The gameplay is the same as 2, 3 or 4 player game. Best as a 3 player game, but there is WAY too much down time in a 4 player game.

Update after 1 year and 8 plays. Surprisingly, I had to bump this from 7.5 to 8. This has held up as a go to. It is fun for what it is.

What a fun little game.   I really like the dice choice mechanism which is a little Ysbahanish in nature.  The way you can string together all sorts of cascading moves where one reward triggers another, etc is super cool, and is at the core of the game.  The only thing holding this game back appears to be the issues it would likely have at a 4 player count.  The downtime with 3 player is bad enough but alright... 4 player would likely be a bit of a slog.

Grand Austria Hotel is a favorite of one of my friends here on the Geek and I figured I'd see what she was going on about... Turns out I really like this game mechanically and it brings a bunch of interesting mechanics and decisions to the table. But the way turn order goes really kills it in even a three player game. Depending on where you sit in the turn order it can be a very long time until you see another turn. I looking forward to trying this as strictly a two player game as my friend now recommends.

Very fun, quick dice placement Euro. I like the "press your luck" mechanic, where you can wait to take  a more desirable action by rolling all the remaining dice after you pass. The game flies by very fast, and you are always so constrained by what you can do that it's an interesting puzzle to try to max out your actions in such a short period of time. Without an expansion, replayability is pretty low, so we'll see how long my rating remains this high.

One of those games where there are points everywhere, and you need to figure out how to score all the different stuff most efficiently. However, there are several reasons I like this one more than many other "points everywhere" games.

1) First and foremost, all the various parts intermesh really really well. Everything you do is connected to several other parts of the game, so you're making a lot of tough decisions. The game is like Bruxelles 1893 in this regard. It's not just a bunch of separate point scoring systems; they're all tied together nicely.

2) There are community goal cards that guide players toward specific aspects of the game, giving you something to focus on in the huge mish mash of point scoring.

3) I generally don't like as much when there is an emphasis in these types of games on just hammering one type of scoring. It seemed that in Grand Austria, you can do a wide scope of things, rather than laser focusing on one thing to hammer. I feel this is a bit more fun and interesting, as you're always looking at several options and trying to decide between them.

The only drawback is there is a ton of iconography on a ton of cards in the game, and the cards do a lot of different things, so players spend a decent amount of time with their nose in the rule book looking up what the cards do. The iconography is good, but there's just so much of it where you'll often need to double-check to make sure you understand the icon correctly.

Overall, neat stuff! Definitely near the top of my generic-euro-with-a-billion-ways-to-score-points-list.

A wonderful game that blends various mechanisms into a nice, thematic Euro. It's often compared to Castles of Burgundy in part by the way you slowly build your hotel and unlocking bonuses by completing certain regions. I love the dice drafting and how the number of dice affect the strength of each action but it can be really devastating when the dice don't go your way. I also like the drafting for staff cards which can help develop a long-term strategy. Great game for 2 and 3 players but too much downtime at 4.

I would like this game if it wasn't for the Emperor track. You can have an unlucky game anyway with the cards coming out and the dice not rolling what you need when you need it and to then have a mechanic that says if you don't get high enough on this track you are going to get punished is ludicrous. I saw one player go 5 turns of the game being unable to do anything and not through bad play. I was going to buy but not if this situation can occur. 1 Play.

On first play, I knew I liked the system, but was worried about the limited player board arrangements and felt the game would be same-y.  After second play, I'm more impressed by it...maybe it was the play with 2 players?  The board became immaterial, as you would likely never come close to filling it.  The tactics became much more pronounced, especially as the guest line started to freeze.  I will institute a helper draft before my next game, but otherwise a solid winner.  Replaces Yspahan for me.

A very unforgiving and overly tight Euro. It really did not play well with my group who loves Euro's. I do admit I may need another play but my initial impression is not a very favorable one. Also the teeny tiny printing on the staff cards, which you do have to reference, is very annoying.

*** Updated 4/2/2016 *** Upped my score, plays really smooth with two people or three. DO NOT PLAY WITH 4. The score may go higher with more plays.

This Medium weight euro with multiple ways to score victory points is right up my alley. First play didn't go so well but enjoyed the mechanics and gameplay. It certainly plays longer than most games of this weight but still good and engaging. Reminds me a bit of Castles of Burgundy.

Dice game, but not a "random" dice game.  The dice allow you to take actions using the dice, and the more dice of a particular number that are rolled, the more often the action can be taken.  I also like the "pass" feature, which allows some rerolls of the dice to expand or manipulate your options.

I like this game.

A great dice drafting game and to me nearly as good as Marco Polo from last year. There is so much variety in this game between the politics cards, emperor cards, and staff cards you could play this game many times and it feel very different. The combos this game can produce are also fantastic as multiple times I was able to complete more than 1 guest on one turn. At least with 2 the game also plays fast with only 7 rounds and 14 turns overall. My only concern is that this game may not come out very often based on my group preferences so while I totally dig the theme finding the right group for this one to see regular plays may be challenging for me.

A fantastic game, the epitome of Lookout design, with a lot of options to consider each turn.  Plenty of variety is provided through Staff and Customer cards, political points, and other scoring objectives (providing plenty of replayability), and the theme is innovative.  The mechanics of choosing which guests to attract, then having to fulfil specific orders before they can occupy a room (themselves needing to be prepared beforehand) is a great little chain, and the innovative use of dice to determine options for each round is spot-on.

Custom pieces for the dishes/drinks have been ordered (through the MeepleSource boardgame tokens KS - Feb 2016) - since cancelled due to game being traded on.

RATING: 5
Dreadful with 4 players.  In addition to excessive downtime, the rules booklet is substandard, the exercise of deciphering staff cards is painful (another game where the graphic artist clearly had no appreciation of why small, fanciful fonts are problematic), and the lack of player aids is a decided minus.  This is a pity, because the mechanisms work well together, and you really want to like the game.  But if I have to go to BGG for multiple rules and card clarifications, the game is operationally broken.  Update: Upon further replay, even worse than originally thought.  Five stars.

This game started out on the right foot with it's dice action selection, the variable player boards, and the territory building, together reminding me of one of my favourite games (The Castles of Burgundy). It has since risen on it's own to maybe be another of my favourites. The drafting of cards, the actions losing power as players take them, the strudels, it all adds up to make something that will be staying in my collection. Although, given my partner's current opinions of this game, I'm worried I might have to figure out a solo variant...

Bland and boring.  Slow and plodding.  Clunky gameplay and zero excitement leave me very disappointed.  I really wanted to like it too.  The more I think about that, the more upset I get.  Theme, art, components great.  Gameplay is lacking and slacking!  The dice drafting seemed cool, but the actions were so beat.

The thematic setting drew me to this game although I'm well aware that theme usually is a very weak argument for a Eurogame. Still I was disappointed about how little the theme is present in this game. All the mechanisms work nicely but in combination it just feels cluttered and there is nothing I haven't seen before. I prefer having to work for my victory points, this games just throws them at you for whatever you do. There are quite a few easter eggs and references to discover. I would play this at any time but don't like it enough to keep my own copy around.

RATING: 8
Works well as a 2 player game - as I read through the rules, I couldn't see why people were stating they'd never play with more than 2.  After actually playing, it became very clear.  The game flows well, and with only 7 rounds it can move well, but referencing the rule book to figure out the iconography and planning moves that would cascade into more moves took more time than I had expected.  It all fits together really well, but is more thinky than I had expected.  It's a good kind of thinky, though, and I'd gladly play this one again.  Hopefully it will get much quicker once all players become used to the cards.
There is a decent amount of luck involved - primarily with the die rolls and distribution of staff cards.  Drafting the staff cards should help mitigate the luck (we played with a standard set for our first learning game).  Die rolls can be manipulated somewhat with the 6 being wild (for a price) and the ability to pass and re-roll.  Staff cards and the 3 political goal cards can help drive decisions early in the game - helpful, since there are so many ways to accumulate points.  Money is tight, though, and ignoring the emperor's track can really prove costly, so players must remain flexible.

RATING: 7
Solid design. Some people at my table complained about the downtime. In each round, turn order goes clockwise around the table, and then counter clockwise. Which means in a 4 player game, the starting player goes, and then 6 turns later he takes his next turn. It didn't bother me so much, but I had my phone to keep me busy. There a nice use of dice where dice are shared, and represent possible actions, and the number of dice that are rolled for each value (1-6) represent the strength of the action, and a die is removed for each action, which means the actions get weaker as you go.

Otro euro del estilo de los que me gustan. Draft de dados para las acciones, tableros para cada jugador, y tema bien integrado que hace fácil entender el juego. Las pegas serían las cartas con los nombres en letra cursiva y microscópica, pequeñas erratas en tableros, y orden de turno algo 'polémico' (a 4 jugadores). Juego genial y muy entretenido! Pocos juegos hay que te dejan una sonrisa en la cara al terminar como lo hace éste! Gran descubrimiento y muy recomendable! Juegazo del 10!

Beautiful involved euro with simple mechanics but plenty of depth. Action drafting with semi-randomized potency. Not an engine builder per se, players aim to maintain a smooth flow balancing several interconnected resources (guests, goods, rooms, money, the emperors favor etc.). High replayability with different boards, goals, guest and personel, works well with all player counts.

Perfectly enjoyable. Turns are sometimes really long as you have to think through all your options. AP prone players should possibly avoid.

On further plays, there is quite a bit of luck with how things come out, but I actually think it is fun dealing with those issues so it doesn't bother me too much. Definitely the biggest downfall of this game is downtime.

I love this game!  You're running a hotel, feeding guests then logding them in your hotel.  You need to prepare rooms based on their colors.  As you complete "sets" of rooms you get extra bonuses.  All the while you're trying to be good with the emperor who will reward you if you keep up on the emperor's track, and punish you if you don't.  The mechanism that drives this game is dice drafting, which is always a plus.  Every game is different.  Oh! There are also employee cards that add in-game/endgame bonuses!  

The ONLY downside is that turn order can bog things down.  It is done Catan style Four player scenario: Player A: 1st & 8th pick; Play B: 2nd & 7th pick; Player C: 3rd & 6th pick; Player D: 4th & 5th pick.  Turns can take a really long time...especially if a player is AP prone.  This is why I think it works very well with two players - faster turn turnaround.

Will not be picking this up, Outlook Games is controlled by Mayfair Games the price fixers. I believe in a supply and demand market, Mayfair Games doesn't not.

Pullimg a MSRP out your ass, putting it on a box, isn't a free market where supply and demand controls price, worst they raised Caverna's price on the second printing by $10 and it their words, to cover some future production cost, is laughable.

Pleasant game of prerequisites and chaining - constrained by the turn's dice pool in a way that probably reduces AP and certainly reduces one's ability to plan with any reliability. Longer-term strategy still seems possible?... but looks like it must incorporate a great deal of tactical flexibility.

Some of the staff seem to be notably better bang-for-the-buck than others? Just a general sense from a single play.

Great job guys.

One rule modification I would make is where it says in the rulebook: "slide all remaining guests on the game board to the right." 

Yeah. I would replace that with: "slide all remaining guests left to the right." I would have greatly enjoyed the cartoon guy reading that sentence in a text balloon. It would be pretty funny.

I want an option to say rude things to that guy that we largely ignored, on our first play and every other play, that wanted to steal our flavor and our fun. I wanted to say things that were dirty, that would shock him and offend his sensibilities. I wanted to be the low class scum that I am in public, and show myself!

Bring the pain and the pleasure. "Sir sometimes we play vigorously. Please do not disturb. Sure we don't got money but we do know how to have fun and we done made some good decisions sometimes. When you as poor as us you have to." 

:D

We rolled few 4's and 6's. We passed some.

Tough and fun. Not too heavy and not too light. Puzzly enough. I am so glad I sold Troyes and Alea Iacta Est. 

It kind of felt like 7 parts Feld and 3 parts Uwe. 

You done good, sirs. I will ask for a replay of this one soon.

Excellent game. It's  a tough puzzle, money is tight and the theme is quite on point. It's a miserable slog. I played twice but boy, I wanted to keep on playing it. It's that type of game and honestly, I have never played a game that felt heavy during play that didn't feel exhausting in the end. This hits my gaming sweet spot in the same way that Power Grid does. Can't wait to play it again.

Luciani's games keep surprising me with clever and innovative dice-management mechanisms. In Grand Austria Hotel, players take turns picking dice from a common pool and performing actions according to both their value and the amount of equivalent dice remaining, giving room for quite some tactical counterdrafting. The gameplay is pretty straightforward (take guests, feed them, give them a room and collect rewards), but with only 14 main actions to be taken during the whole game it all comes down to getting the most out of each of your turns. Besides, the huge amount of different staff cards that you can play to get powers and bonuses encourages tactical play and combo madness, which I particularly enjoy a lot.

Secret Santa 2016

First impressions: it's got combo chains, its got puzzles to solve, it's got the whole "here's some stuff, do the best you can" thing I love so much.  Plays smoothly with 2, makes you feel smart when you figure out a way to achieve what you want (reminiscent of Mage Knight, actually), and looks to have lots of variability.

Is it too similar in feel to Castles of Burgundy?  Is it better?  Time will tell.  I initially thought this would compete with Troyes, but they feel quite a bit different.

3 plays in, and some worries.  First, I do not like the Emperor track.  It feels contrived, moreso than the feeding in Agricola (at least that gave a goal for the strategic engine).  It seems to force a Yellow strategy, as in "complete at least one big block of yellow rooms, or get hammered." 

Second, the game is feeling very samey.  This is surprising, given the variety in guests and staff.  But at a higher level, it is just "complete guest to get free minor action that helps complete other guests" and so on.  It is very tactical, at the expense of an overall strategy.  In other words, you can't pick a strategic path to explore (as you can with the right combo of employees in Agricola, or beers in Brew Crafters, or cards in RFTG).  You make constant tactical move after tactical move.  Going for a bakery (i.e. strudel and cake) strategy is nonsense, and so is a Blue room strategy.  (In this way, it is the exact opposite of Russian Railroads, where you basically pick a single strategy that is given to you at the start, and run with it.  I guess I like something in the middle: veins of strategy to discover, but multiple points in-game where you can switch lines).

It's surprising, because the designer's other game, Voyages of Marco Polo, does let you pick a line of strategy to follow (informed by character special powers, route cards, city bonuses, and contracts) but lets you switch up when new cities or contracts become available.

This game is great. Extremely well designed and fully developed. Everything feels thematic, from guests arriving to your hotel and filling their orders to sending them to their rooms and receiving rewards. The thing that's so great is that there's always a purpose and thematic goal to what you're doing. The balance of randomness and control is perfect. The cards create nice combos and are very useful. There is tons of replayability and it's great with two.

The Grand Austria Hotel is an interesting dice drafting game where players are competing to attract guests to stay in their hotel by first providing tasty strudels, cakes, coffee, or wine. After their tummies are satisfied, you then can put them in your hotel. Oh, and the King might come around and inspect your premises to make sure everything is up to code. It is fun and meaty, and there are plenty of tough decisions in the game. Highly recommended, but only for 2-3 players. Downtime can be a big problem with 4 players.

We really like the dice drafting mechanism in this game. We really like the tough decision making that results from it. This game would rank much higher except for the fact that in a couple of games, we felt like we could not accomplish much because the dice rolled poorly. We were reluctant to pass to much on our turns in early games though and that may fix this issues if we pass a bit more.

Players have too much to get done and not enough resources to do everything they'd like. Based on the dice, you may need to formulate a new strategy due to lacking guests and workers. The emperor track needs to really be done by everyone and I haven't found a way to rack up points without opting in.

[17 Jul 2017] - 7.5 (13 plays)
This is a tight, efficiency euro where you're basically trying to build chains of action so you can get more done in a game than your opponent. Turns can take some time to perform and when combined with the Catan/snake turn ordering, it can quickly feel long between turns. This game can make you feel like a genius when you can get the nice chains and score the big points. There is always competition for guests and available dice, making it important if you're going 1st/4th to check out what your opponent might do and plan accordingly. The big downside to this game is the randomness in terms of what guests you see, what the dice faces show and what staff cards you get to see in the game. 

[25 Jan 2018] - 7.5 (14 plays)
Finally played at 3 players. The length of the game does increase with more players and it seems like 45 min/player is about the average play time. I guess you could get it down to 30 min/player if everyone knows their stuff. The snake order does mean that there's a lot of downtime between turns if you're first. The upshot to more players is that you cycle through the guest cards faster. I might try tinkering with a rule where the free guests are cleared after every round with 2 just to force the churn of the cards more. Drafting the staff is a must as well. In the 3 player game, I ended up with lots of staff for end game bonuses while the other players got a couple staff early that gave them more actions or more powerful actions. Tough to keep up with them and that lead to less points in the end game. Still like the game and will be bring it back out again.

The game is fantastic. I love the artwork and the theme. Rocks my socks off.

I do have issues with the script font used on the staff cards. While thematically awesome, it's difficult to read the names. Perhaps in a future printing, at least have the first letter of the staff member's name be in a more legible script.

I've played with four, and it wasn't terrible, but I definitely think this game shines with two.

Games of this sort now seem to come out daily. I'm looking at you, too, La Granja. The dice account for six actions. Choose one. You can take a few additional optional actions regardless of the die you select. You score points seemingly in a hundred different ways, sometimes without intending to do so. And the cards in GAH.... Many of those are re-usable every turn if you can remember you have them. [sigh] These games are fun enough, but one is enough to own.

PROS: Can play 4 people; lots of paths to victory, theme and mechanics integrate well; nice color scheme and excellent graphics.

CONS:4-player takes forever; lots of downtime when it's not your turn; too much iconography and it is very confusing; no player interaction.  the game seems "fiddly" somehow.

I really want to like this game.  I'm going to try it again with only 2-player to see if it works better.

OK, so 2-player does go faster, but less fulfilling.  I think 3 will be the sweet spot for this one. Overall though, its not a keeper.

I really like the game.  It's a fairly unique game.  Much like Ysaphan where you categorize dice and pick a category for a particular action.  But you don't take all the dice just one...and now the category becomes "one less" good.

The game swings pretty heavily towards the end depending on if the dice match what you need.  But I think with more plays, this luck factor can be mitigated.  A negative is that there are a lot of cards that are difficult to interpret what they do.  And the rule book doesn't explain them with pictures.  You have to look up the German name in the rule book to cross reference what the card does.  Even if this were in English it would be a pain.  I really want to play this one again.  I don't buy many games these days, but this one is on my radar if I enjoy my next play.  It is different enough to earn a spot on my shelf if replays prove luck is not such a dominant factor.

For some reason, I just find myself always wanting to play this.  Upgrading from a 7 to a 9 though suspect this will settle into an 8 over time. Good theme for such a simple game.

An excellent dice drafting game. The theme really comes together in my opinion. Satisfying your customers and then sending them to their designated rooms is quite satisfieing. There is a lot to think about but the mechanisms are quite simple to remember and execute.
It is quite tight game and you always feel like you're not quite doing as well as you could. I'm looking forward to exploring this game more.
The rulebook could've done with a little more work. Especially when it comes to the employee card descriptions.

Players enter the hospitality industry, and manage a hotel in Austria.  Players need to attract guests into their cafes, ply them with wooden cuboid food, then squirrel them off to a room in their hotel.  As guests check in, they grant the players a power, enabling combos and chains to fire up.  Nicely designed game, but I spotted about six problems.  Long, long game with four players, and the downtime is truly a problem. Cards seem weirdly priced and valued - not sure that it's balanced.  The emperor penalty track is superfluous and could easily be cut from the game.  I liked 75% of it, but it could have been a great frothy 75 minute game with a more ruthless developer.

Really solid mix of familiar elements.  The game is almost literally 1/3 Yspahan, 1/3 Last Will, and 1/3 Castles Of Burgundy.   It works well and plays straighforward after half a play.   The artwork is a bit of a negative in my book - I don't think the heavy lines and digital shading look very good.   But, I'm comparing it in my mind to Last Will, which looks amazing.   The iconography could have been a bit more intuitive, I think.   But these are very minor gripes.   I am debating whether or not to acquire a copy of this.   Probably won't, since I have the aforementioned games already, and have access to this via other friends.

Played once and didn't do well against my opponents.  Would like to play again to see if it was my inability to leverage the guests and employees as well as the others or if it may have been luck of the draw.  (I suspect the fault was with my strategy.)

Excellent theme.  Fun to play.  Played with 2 and 3 players so far and has become a favorite and continues to climb.  Straight Fired CoB for the time being as our favorite medium weighter.

While 2p is a tad more engaging, the downtime with 3p or 4p is not an issue for us.  Use the variant and you are set.  Plenty to consider while another player makes their decision/takes their turn.

The design and game play of Grand Austria Hotel are excellent.  Dice determine your actions and the decisions you make are difficult as everything is tight in this game.  It is all clever and well thought through.

The downside is the unacceptable downtime.  On your turn you often have a fair few things to do, especially if you put a client into the hotel.  And turn order goes clockwise then anticlockwise.  So if you are player one in a round you won't get another turn until everyone else has had two turns,  this could mean waiting 10 minutes.

So, a solid Euro with disappointing side effects.

RATING: 8

The latest vogue for action selection via dice comes to the table again with Grand Austria Hotel.  In this instance there are 6 actions to choose from (D1-D6).  You roll a bunch of dice and sort via value. And the quantity of dice showing that number of pips indicates how many times you can take the action, or how much discount you get when taking that action in one instance.  You take the action, remove the die, and the following player will have one less on offer for that particular action.

This is another multi-player solitaire where the interactivity occurs only in terms of: the dice you choose (which reduces the options for subsequent players); and from cards in the common card pool of ‘customers’; and from the race for achieving certain ‘political’ bonuses.  These latter bonuses are big points and so that is where the race is on in terms of first to get each of these.

The game itself is solid with nicely integrated mechanisms of fulfilling customer contracts which allows you to put a customer in the hotel, but only if you have already prepared the room.  So it is a case of managing the flow of your actions to ensure everything is ready at the right time.  This, along with the race for the bonuses, is the game in a nutshell.

Whilst it all works seamlessly there are two major issues:

This is a two player game disguised as a 2-4 player game. That said, managing an array of hotel guests in your tableau as you scurry to prepare meals and rooms to secure their stay in your hotel is a blast. There's a lot of opportunity for very strategic play, but just as easy to feel overwhelmed with the tasks required to fill your hotel with guests. The game is basically 14 turns long, but there's quite a bit going on within that time. I've read this works best with two players, but over a couple of games this was very unbalanced and did not feel like a great game for couples.

This game should be right up my alley, dice drafting, resource management, etc., but I struggled in my first game. I think I have a better handle on it now. Overall, very enjoyable and I'd like to find someone (wife?) who would play several 2 player games over a short period of time. Couple critiques:

-Iconography - not so good... had to refer to the rulebook and cheat sheets several times... I need to work on a better visual reference than what's on BGG now...
-Bonus scoring - I like how the staff is drafted but there's still a lot of room for lucky draws of staff cards... specifically end game bonus scoring. May be better if there were 3 face up staff cards to choose from and a free action to spend money to discard them (once per round or similar restriction)

Rating this one a 7.5 for now... I like Marco Polo (same designer) more and that won't likely change, but I think this could creep up to an 8 with more play.

RATING: 7
Grand Austria Hotel is a good dice drafting euro. Recently a number of dice euros have been worker placement + dice, so this feels a bit unique. When you draft dice, the action is amplified by the number of dice in that actions section (which is determined by the number of pips). These actions are as follows:

1 - Acquire strudel/cake
2 - Acquire wine/coffee
3 - Prepare rooms
4 - Acquire money/advance on the emperor's track
5 - Play a staff card
6 - Pay $1 to choose one of the other actions

You will be able to draft 2 actions per round. If you don't like the position of the dice, you can 'skip' that round of drafting. After everyone has drafted or passed, all the non-drafted dice will be re-rolled minus 1 die for a second round of drafting within the same game round. If you're still not satisfied, you can pass again, at your own risk.

In the game, you're fulfilling the desires of customer by feeding them strudel, cake, wine, and coffee. When fulfilled, they will provide VP, a one-time benefit, and will stay at your hotel. To stay at your hotel, you must have a room prepared that the particular type of customer will want to stay in. Preparing a room usually takes actions and money. There is a Castles of Burgundy thing where, you will get a bonus for filling all the rooms of a clumped colour. Though, in GAH, it's not solely VP and the current round has no bearing. Like COB, there is a basic board that's the same for everyone and an asymmetric one on the opposite side.

Here are the things I enjoy about GAH:

-There are a lot of card effects that you will be utilizing over the game between the staff cards and the customer cards.

-There are goal tiles that you and the other players are racing towards. Only 3/12 are used each game.

-The emperor track can be viewed as a 'feeding your people' sort of mechanism. I normally dislike this, but it's only punishing if you ignore it and can actually be quite rewarding if you focus on it. You only use 3/12 of the tiles associated with this track each game as well.

As you can tell, it has a bit of similarity to Castles of Burgundy. Like CoB, I prefer playing Grand Austria Hotel with 2 players only. With more players there can be a fair bit of downtime due to the turn order (1-2-3-4-4-3-2-1). So much so that the designer has posted a variant for people who want to reduce the downtime:

https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1490865/turn-order-variant-how-reduce-downtime-3-4-players

Other than that, if you like dice euros with a ton of variety, this is one that you should definitely check out.

Firstly, the game is deceptively simple (besides the iconography). There are six available dice actions to choose from, but two are more or less identical and another acts as 'wild', so that boils down to only four actions. These actions play well into the game's hotelier theme, which proved to be stronger than expected. And despite only taking 14 actions throughout the game, players are rewarded with an Agricola-esq feeling of progress and completion as they can admire their completed hotel. The biggest surprise of all were the parallels to Castles of Burgundy. Both games score via point-salad, creatively implement dice, provide group-completion bonuses, are open to action combos, and play quickly. The main difference is Grand Austria has an actual theme and high production value, which is enough to supplant CoB in my collection.

This is the newest game that I've added to my collection and already I feel that it is a keeper. For me it evokes some feelings of playing Firenze, some of playing Loyang, but with its own unique flavour. I love the dice action selection, the fact that there are more cards and tiles than are needed in the game to generate replayability (you never know exactly which cards and tiles will be in the game), the multiple ways to get points, and just the feeling of the game in general. It's a brilliant, brilliant design and I'm glad I picked it up. I don't normally review a game after only 1 play because I don't think that's fair to the game, however, there are some production issues which I think could be fixed in a second printing and I will note them below. None of these things are critical mind you. I wouldn't burn my copy of the game or anything :), but there have been some careless errors which can be improved upon.

Cards: Decent enough cardstock but I did find a spelling error on one of them (Floristin is spelled Flosistin) and there may be more but I don't speak German so I can't say that for sure. Probably missed in proofreading because the Staff names are INcredibly tiny. Not recommended for those with poor eyesight and/or low lighting conditions. I'm sure a design can be found where the names can be printed in a decent size on the bottom of the cards and still look really good. The icons are not always intuitive but I am sure that will improve with more plays.

Tiles: Nice thickness to the tiles, but all of the C and some of the B tiles are printed upside down so after shuffling there's some faffing about trying to put them right on the gameboard.

Hotel boards: Good size, very well organised, but there is a misprint on one of the boards - red room door/yellow wallpaper, yellow room door/red wallpaper. The player discs are also too big for the office spaces covering literally half of another number so sometimes if your disc slides even a little bit you're not sure exactly how much money you have. In the future I think I'll just use some cubes. 

Rulebook: Some of the card/tile effects have slightly incorrect descriptions but details of those can be found in the forums. When in doubt, go with the card icons. There is also a mistake in the description of the 1 die function. It mentions coffee when in that space you can only take either strudel or cake! I wouldn't mind seeing an updated rulebook available for download with a more detailed description of some card effects and a beefed up FAQ incorporating some of the confusing issues people have been having.

This game is fantastic. There are only 14 main actions that each player will be able to complete over the course of 7 rounds. I love that there is some luck in the dice rolls because those dice are the core of the game and if you continually roll dice that you don't need, those 14 actions will be wasted and every single action is absolutely vital. There are many different paths to victory with unlimited replayability. Tense and fun, yet stressful.

I really digg this game.
Although it suffers from some down time issues with more players I decided to almost only play this with 2.
It works very well with 2 players and the down time isn't an issue anymore.
It must be said that some luck is needed with the cards and dices but I'm not 100% certain that it determines the game.
Other then that a very decent euro dice drafting game!

RATING: 7.5
I definitely agree with player count being only 2 or 3P max as there can be long intervals between your turns, but I still liked the game. It's an order fulfillment game where you draft the cards (hotel guests) you wish to fulfill (by placing food & drink cubes on their cards to satisfy them). 

But then there's another layer whereby you need to put the guest in a room on your hotel board. And that requires the right color room for the guest -- and having it ready for the guest once you've satisfied them as per above. 

Those two elements alone are pretty straightforward and not very inspiring in themselves. Where the game comes to life is in the cards. There are two types. First, you have a hand of cards to play. These can be either in game bonus effects or endgame points. Then, those hotel guest cards you draft have a bonus effect on them which is activated when you show the guest to their room.

The fun, then, is in using your hand of cards as well as timing the activation of powers on guest cards to squeeze out more actions than you're normally allotted and to score endgame points. You usually only get 2/turn x 7 = 14 actions. You can chain together some actions for some big blowout turns that feel pretty satisfying. I lagged behind my opponents for most of the game but shot ahead with a 23 point turn after chaining several cards together. Then I scored another 50+ points in endgame cards and won going away. 

If you notice the recommended player count, 4P is NOT recommended. Reason is, due to the snaking turn order, you may go 1st then last in a round. In between it can be a long time as the downside to the latitude the game gives you is players getting caught in AP as they try to puzzle out their best option. I'd never play with more than 3P. Also, the iconography and text are hard to follow and read. I'm sure things will get much better on the 2nd play but be prepared to help people with "What does this mean?" a lot during their first game.

I don't care for the card stock used for the cards and the dice, but the rest of it is pretty good production value.

This game has effectively replaced Castles of Burgundy for us.  If they both came out in the same year I would have probably favored GAH over CoB, but hard telling.

I appreciate this game more each time I play it.

Typical score the most points Euro game by selecting actions to complete objectives. The almost zero player interaction currently prevents me from rating this higher; maybe that will change with more plays as I would rather play Castle Burgundy which is in the same vein but has a more intense race feel trying to get things before other players. BTW: the rulebook is a chore with ineffective layout and important rules in unexpected areas.

2017-05-28: It is a good game, but not revolutionary, although I like how the number of dice affects the power of the actions. The rulebook is horrible though, and even the v2.0 book doesn't fix all problems. (For instance, the rule of 'you may put cubes directly on guest when you get them' is still hidden in the wrong place!)
Also, the downtime issue is quite jarring.

This game is often compared to Castles of Burgundy, which seems fair: they both use dice-driven action selection as well as acquiring things that later needs to be installed (tiles for CoB; guests for GAH). And yet, for all that, I think Grand Austria Hotel is better by a country mile.

Better art, better things to acquire (unique, one-of guests), and most of all, better gameplay. In every Stefan Feld game that I have played, you can't really shoot yourself in the foot, nor can you pull of something astounding: the points train just moves forward at varying speeds, with better players moving quicker with their points train. GAH on the other hand does have those moments where you watch your strategy spiral down the drain due to a poor play or two, or suddenly your strategy clicks and your combo goes off for a victory. Much more satisfying.

I bought this with some trepidation as most of our games are 3-4 players and I read that this does not scale well due to the turn order and associated downtime.

Our first play was with 3 players and the second 4 players.  I need not have worried! even with one slightly AP prone player, the game flows well.  Yes there is a wait for player 1 between his first and second go (1-8) but it's not to the detriment of the game.

I can see this getting a lot more plays and definitely a keeper for me.

After first playing, definitely is living up to my expectations. Harder game than I thought. Completing guests' orders can be quite challenging. Dice rolling and card draws are random, but that's all part of the game. Next time, I'll focus on filling up rooms rather than taking on harder guests that sit in the café for multiple rounds while waiting for orders to be filled. Can't wait to play again!

Update: After three plays, raising it to 9.75. This game is nearly perfect in every way. So many possibilities and there is an ongoing excitement and anxiousness throughout the game to want to complete several different actions--but can't! Is it more worth it to play a staff card to generate more food/drinks on subsequent turns, or should I work on preparing more rooms for completion to gain bonuses? Then I must keep the end game in mind and play my staff cards that will gain more points for all completed red rooms. So many choices and so few turns to get everything accomplished!

Update #2: Raising it to a 10. This game is a slam dunk for two players. Forget the icons, the German text, and slightly flimsy cards (just sleeve them!), and look at the game itself. Perfection. The only game my wife wants to play right now, and we can't get enough!

Sok jó ötlet van benne, és elég tematikusra is sikeredett. Az egyedi téma külön jó pont. Mondjuk azt nem értem, hogy miért kell egy bort is mindig kiönteni ahhoz, hogy kávét főzzek, de ezen azért felül lehet kerekedni. :)
A kockás mechanizmust szerintem sikerült sokkal jobbra csinálni, mint a marco poloban, ahol azért elég sok múlik a megfelelő dobásokon. Természetesen itt se mindegy, hogy mi kerül a poolba, de mivel közös így sokkal igazságosabbnak tűnik a dolog. Az alkalmazottakat kicsit furának találtam, mert az áruk sokszor nem volt annyira szinkronban a képességükkel. Vannak marha drágán is elég gyengék és olcsón is elég jók. Persze egy játék után ezt lehet, hogy korai megítélni.

In Grand Austria Hotel players need to service various customers in order to benefit from their special abilities. Collect food to serve in your café and hire staff to help with the chores like cleaning up the rooms.

Their are 5 different actions, and which of them can be selected and how often they can be executed on one turn is determined by a dice pool that is rolled once each round. Each die allows taking the action corresponding to the rolled number once that round. Since a die gets removed for each action taken, options diminish towards the end of a round. Choosing which action to take at which point so you still get to do what you need when your next turn comes around is perhaps the central decision of the game. Obviously, this is a very tactical decision although it can certainly support a longer-term strategy.

While the action selection works well the associated actions are pretty much your standard resource trope: prepare rooms, get customers, collect food, serve customers, profit. Lots of different customer and staff special powers might serve to change the game a little from play to play but in combination with the turn order system they also lead to fairly long downtimes. The only interaction points are the selection of dice and customers (and getting in each other's hair there is largely circumstancial and almost never deliberate) so the game is unfortunately one of those rather long and mostly solitary optimization puzzles. I'm sure it will have its fans but I'm not one of them.

GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL ist ein ziemlicher Optimierungsbolzen. Künstlerische Innovation und Bohème sucht man in der Wiener Moderne vergeblich. Solitär spielt der Hotelier d' Autiste in einsamer Konvention vor sich hin. Und die Downtime zu viert ist abartig: Der Startspieler wartet satte sieben Züge bis er wieder dran kommt. Das reicht um für die Gäste am Spieltisch einen Apfelstrudel zu backen. Der gesunde Menschenverstand wird zusehen, dass er Grübler meidet. Dies ist womöglich der größte Verdienst des Spiels: die Aussortierung von Denkapparaten aus dem potenziellen Mitspielerkreis. Was bleibt ist köstliche Geschmacksache in einem Café-Getriebe indem man tunlichst nicht aus dem Tritt geraten sollte, aber gerade aus der Verkantung der Optimierung seinen Reiz bezieht. Richtig gute rationale Gründe das Herumoptimieren zu mögen, gibt es nicht. Ich tue es trotzdem heiss und innig. GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL ist eines der schönsten Brettspiele der Welt! Das mag auch am charmanten Thema mit unnachahmlichem Wiener Charme liegen oder an der formidablen Gestaltung oder einfach daran, dass bei mir das Herz der Operette über ein Spiel entscheidet und nicht der Verstand.

Starts off at full pace instead of giving you the satisfying feeling of growing your engine.

The wide variety of staff cards are excellent for replayability.

With Andrew & Rob at LFG 16.  Andrew wins by a mile with good use of the gardener.  Its an ok game, has all the Euro elements and an ok theme, but in the end, meh!  If you dont roll man 1s or 2s you can really get stuck with diners and it just becomes a waiting game.  Although, I like the pass mechanic.   If I owned it I think I would always find a way to play some other game. (rating 5.473, July 16).

RATING: 7
Such a difficult game to rate.  The best thing I can say is that this game takes Yspahan to the next level and I do overall enjoy the action selection mechanic that uses dice in this way (the luck here does not bother me as I don't mind responding tactically).  And there is lots to do and consider.  A rarely used theme which I'm fine with.  Well-written rulebook and the art is fine.  The game alone on these points is worthy of an '8'.  But there are things I'm quite critical of: the 4-player game is ugly. Downtime is laughably extreme (though I can't totally think of an immediate way to keep the balance while reducing downtime between turns - and neither could the designers obviously!) Another problem with 4-player games is that by the time it gets back to your turn (especially when there are 6 or 7 turns between) everything on the board has changed. As such, there is hardly anything to think about when it is not your turn. You better enjoy watching other people scratching their heads for 10 minutes, because that is an average wait time in 4p games.  Beyond 4p issues, I now realize I'm quite critical of games that are simply not fun to lose at. I'm always most impressed with games that are fun regardless if you are losing. I'm sure this is a first-time player criticism, but I could smell my loss 3 rounds before the game was over, so about 45 minutes of my life (though I spent only 5-6 minutes actually interacting with the game during that time) was knowing that there was nothing in my power to even compete while those who were in the top spots keep racking up the points. Argh!  There are definitely cards you can buy that feel OP. (Either I'm not seeing the balance or the game encourages you to draw through the worker cards so that you can cherry pick the best of the worst.) But often times luck will rule as a player only invests minimally into cards but manages through the fates to get some very strong advantages.  And finally, the Emperor Points and bonuses feels tacked on and not gaining the bonus (and especially being in the negative) disadvantages you to a point where you can't catch up.  (Same with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd place points.)  So in the end, very finely used mechanics in terms of dice and hand management but some real issues with 4p games (this must be best 2 or 3p) and luck of the draw and roll and can really outweigh any sort of feeling of control in certain situations. I'm giving this a '7' instead of a '6' because these issues are probably more related to my personal issues with downtime and lucky card draws than inherent functional issues with the game.

RATING: 7.5
This is a pretty game with an interesting, novel theme.  I like the central mechanic: feed the guest in your cafe and make sure there's an open room in your hotel and they'll stay the night.  You get points for that and for having sections of your hotel filled.

Two problems: first is the down time.  Because the turn order is serpentine (in a two player game, you'll be 1st /4th or 2nd/3rd) you'll wait a lot between turns.  This game can create AP.  The more players, the longer the wait so I wouldn't play this with 4.  

The second problem for me is the random track you have to complete (the "emperor track" here).  This is a mechanism that's shared by Rococo and Tzolk'in and it's one that I always dislike.  I hate being forced to pursue this random track OR ELSE; I'd rather focus on the main theme of guests in a hotel.  I like more freedom and prefer multiple paths to victory.

That being said, I like this game and will definitely be playing it again.

Great game with 2 or 3. With 4 the downtime becomes an issue. AP-prone people should not play this game, unless all players are fine with AP. 
Thematically a nice game, with enough variability to ensure replayability. It provides a nice feel when you work hard and see satisfied customers off to their rooms. The emperor-scale is thematically okay but the implementation is a bit too complex for my taste.

Dice selection mechanic is enjoyable and has a new "passing" twist.  Enough variability in what you can specialize in even though the game is more focused than a point salad.  Fun to prepare and fill your rooms as well as please the local politicians and emperor.  A little bit of a table hog.  Quick play time and you are definitely interested in what others are doing.  Tough to plan ahead though as the game state changes from turn to turn.  Rating may go down in the coming years but as of now a top game for us.

Edit 11/10/16

Almost traded it away.  Played it again this week.  NOT trading this away.  The OOP demand almost got me to make that mistake.  Wait for Mayfair to reprint it, but this one is different enough from, but as good as, Marco Polo!

RATING: 8.5
Rating for 2p only. Basically multi-player solitaire, but tight, crunchy, combo rich, and very satisfying. Quite thematic too. Lots of replayability between guests, staff, emperor bonuses/penalties, and goal cards. Luck is there but mostly impacts both players equally, though it may favor one player's strategic or tactical needs at any particular moment. Drafting staff cards add strategic depth. Lots of iconography, but it's mostly clear after one play. 

Lots of comparisons to Castles of Burgundy around. Both share lots of comboing, completing areas for rewards, managing three slots for guests/hexes, and dice, but they're very different games. CoB is more elegant, strategic, and interactive; but each player is also at the whims of their own dice and their ability to manipulate them. GAH is crunchier, requiring you to juggle more at once, tighter and more punishing, and plays out quite differently depending on the goal cards and emperor tiles in play. I'm glad to have both.

RATING: 8
Components: good quality
Complex: easy to teach and learn
Weight: light to medium
Players: 2, could also with 3
Length: around 60 mins
Mechanics: take dice, do action... combo your cards
Decisions: a lot, you do not have time to do everything
Opinion: good game with a good theme on it. Could say that the theme fits the game and the actions you take.
You manage an Hotel in Austria and try to prepare rooms for your guests, while having guests in your cafe ready to go for a room. In the meantime, you have to care about the Emperor, as He is visiting your Hotel sometimes during the game. This is briefly what the game goes about.
And what you do on your turn? You have to pick a die from the action pool, and do the action associated to the value. Depending on how many dice were there, you can do a better action or not so powerful. And the actions are take food/drinks, prepare rooms, take money or please the Emperor, hire staff or a kind of joker action.
If you go only for the base actions, you would not do much during the game. The main point on it are the combos you get with your cards, and that is something i like. If you serve this guest, he will give you that bonus, and then the room he takes will give you that other bonus. Oh wait, but with the staff you have hired you can get that other bonus out there...
Do and repeat, but not on a bad way, with only 7 rounds, and 2 turns per round you do not have the feeling that you are doing the same over and over.
By the end of the game you start thinking that you could have done a different thing, and you have the feeling that your Hotel has not enough rooms for your guests, you need more.. more what? more guests? more rooms? is the Emperor quite important for you?
I game I have liked to play with my wife, the length is less than 60 mins with two, so you can play more than once in a row, and the feeling of each play is different from the previous one

I enjoyed the dice drafting more here than in La Granja.
Filling your rooms feels a lot like building your estate in Castles of Burgundy.
The flexibility/individuality offered by staff cards is reminiscent of occupations in Agricola.

This all adds up to a very enjoyable dice drafting Euro. One of my favorites of 2016.

GAH, more than any other game in my collection, is a game that needs to be played multiple time to truly grasp the strategy. The key is getting multiple staff cards in play, but the dice don't always cooperate for that. You need the additional actions and game breakers that the staff allow. The decisions on which guest to take into your hotel based on their color and recipe fulfillment is critical. The game is so multi-layered and interesting, giving the game significant replay-ability.

Played one 2 player game so far. Lots going on. I suspect it will be best with 2. March 2016

*UPDATE* 2nd game again 2 player. The hard to read text on the staff cards is still bugging me and I brought an English language version so why are the staff job titles written in German? The game took 90 mins. The decisions tend to be a bit fussy, "if I take that card, those dice, expend these resources, I'll get that which will allow me to do this... hold on that doesn't work I don't have enough money... Now if I take that card then do..." For some people this game is going to be a nightmare. I'm enjoying it but the decisions do chain together with more links than I can comfortably hold in my head. Aprl 2016.

*UPDATE* I have played this 8 times now with all player counts. Familiarity has made the late game brain freeze go away. Down time is an issue especially with the 4 player game but this is all that stops it from being as great as Marco Polo. May 2017

RATING: 9
This is *really* unforgiving if you screw up money management. Not sure how it could be better; if you could, in extremis, pay 5 points for 1 crown or something, it might prevent total logjams but would turn some of the gripping tension into bookkeeping. Maybe that would still be better?

Anyway, if you make it out alive it's pretty delightful. You'll only have 14 turns, so your 10-15 guest bonuses (mostly comparable in value to one action) account for close to half the resources you'll get in the game. And so there's a tight game of drafting and action chaining here. Just don't spend yourself down to zero. Ever.

Attract people to your hotel by gving them what they want in the café and then make sure you have appropriate rooms for them to stay in your hotel. It uses a dice-drafting type of mechanic, not too dis-similar to something like Yspahan. Always feels like you're one step behind where you need to be to get your rooms ready and in the right part of your hotel to maximize your score. Fun game.

Grand Austria Hotel is a German style puzzle game. Cyclical resource generation to fulfill contracts that continue the process. The fun part is in its action selection. Players roll a handful of dice and select actions from the result. Multiple of one number will lead to more actions of that choice. Strategy seems to come down to always selecting the most efficient action with the most die results and figuring out how that adapts to your efficiency model. Like most game of this style, it is satisfying, but not horribly fun. So far, Marco Polo is still my favorite from these designers.

Interesting puzzle / combo game that works well at it's core, but shows some problems.

1) Like many others already said, don't play it with more than 3, as the downtime is really no fun at all!

2) If you spend all your money, you are pretty much screwed for the whole game, unless you have a good chain running to get back up soon (which is just luck, getting the right cards).

3) The game helps the rich to get richer, while it punishes the poor in every way, which is just too much.

No Money -> no rooms -> no visitors -> no occupancy bonus / no card bonus / no emperor bonus, instead you get punished from all those sides...


I had fun before all that came up, so I might give it another chance as a 2-3 player chance, but if it all depends on the cards, I don't see it going up a single step.

Euro de gestió de daus i combos. Cada jugador representa el manager d'un hotel que ha d'aconseguir atraure clients al seu hotel (primer al cafe i, un cop els hi ha servit el que demanen, els puntua i ocupen una habitació). El mecanisme de selecció d'accions està prou bé: el primer jugador tira un nombre determinat de daus (en funció del nombre de jugadors) i cada dau es col·loca segons el seu valor en una acció determinada. Quan és el torn d'un jugador, aquest selecciona un dau i fa l'acció tantes vegades com el nombre de daus que hi han a l'acció.

A 4 no és gaire recomanable, ja que pot generar moltíssim downtime.

He really thought he was losing by a ton but ended up coming within 9 points of my win. He wants to rate it a 6. I would give it a 7.5. This first game did drag on for a long time--3hours! But we were learning the rules and the icons. I expect future games (if I can get him to play again) to go quicker.

a game with a nice puzzle to solve, and some newish mechanics at play (for example the passing mechanic).

However, there are three random elements at play. The customers, the staff cards you draw during the game, and the dice. That in itself is not a problem, as long as the game is nice and short. This game is quite long, especially with AP prone players, as they endlessly have to assess the situation as it changes. every player only do 14 main actions in this game, so it shouldn't take too long, but it did for us. (Roughly 3 hours incl rules explaination) 

If played with only players that are swift and snappy, this game will probably shine. In all other cases it will be a frustrating experience of waiting...

Pleasant theme, I like the variable setup and the main dice mechanism. I need more plays to think about all the other aspects of the game.

The often criticized downtime inducing turn order did not bother me that much. I need the time to prepare my turn – but bad luck if the player before ruins your plans by taking the wanted guest or dice. Downtime aside, the 4-player game was still too long and slow.

(We played the pass-and-reroll-later rule wrong in our first game. Not sure how this influenced the game.)

Update, 2016-09:

First of all this game has one of the most boring theme i have ever encountered. Even the gameplay still not adds to it you are making contacts and trying to get the needed cubes to get an opportunity to close the room doors. Well this is not interesting at all. You can make points from a lot of ways. Every single turn you are rolling with dice which determines the actually possible actions. Ahh, meh i don't want to play this game ever again. On the other hand the game can be great easily if i somehow manage to get over the pasted on theme.

Mindebben segítségünkre lesz felfogadott személyzetünk is 
A dobott kockákat értékük szerint rakjuk és a dobott kockák számának megfelelő erősséggel hajtjuk végre az akciót, ez kicsit hasonlít az Yspahanra. 
A játék lényegét egyértelműen a vendég- és a személyzeti lapok adják. A vendégek által biztosított jutalmakkal mintegy egymásra építkezve haladhatunk előre hatékonyan a játékban. A személyzet egyrészt  egymással is jól kombózhatóak, másrészt sok közülük játék végi győzelmi pontokat ad, amelyek legtöbbször elengedhetetlenek a győzelem kivívásához. 
Ez egy kellemes, könnyebb stratégia játék, amelyben a közös kockakészlet-menedzsment mindenképpen jó ötlet, illetve a játék kitűnően működik, euro létére jól illeszkedik a témához, élvezetes vele játszani.

Delightful game - charming theme, quite easy to learn but lots of interesting decisions.

After a few plays we like it even more and its one of the few my husband specifically requests to play.

We've had a few games with huge swings between players and knowing in round 5 or 6 that there's no way to win.  No fun when that happens.  It is possible to mitigate the dice rolls to a point but it's more difficult to get the cards and dice rolls to work together.  On a couple occasions I've had my engine stall mid-game due to dice rolls.

Edited: Realized we weren't taking proper advantage of the re-roll, which makes a big difference.  It still doesn't knock Castles of Burgundy off the pedestal though.

I LOVED playing this game.
Each round, you select two actions based on what dice were rolled--the more of a number rolled, the more effective that action is. Then you remove a die of that number, making that action less powerful for the next player. Alternatively, you have the option to completely pass--after EVERYONE has selected their actions, you may re-roll (with of course much less dice) if you are desperate for a particular action.

It is a nice mechanic but because of this planning over what actions you are going to take, can take a surprising amount of time for a round, especially once you have a collection of things built up on your player board.

Only thing keeping it from an 8 is that the game moves exponentially faster at lower player counts, which makes this a game I won't get to play much of.

We played this 4-players and I think that was the longest Downtime I ever had in a game. Now: It wasn't boring, and I was somehow involved in the Turns from other players. But all in all, it took to long for what it is.
I will certainly never play this again with 4 players.

If only for the 4-player problematic, I'd give this probably a 7. After all, the downtime reduces dramatically on lower player counts and there are other games that just put a higher number on player count than it is ideal.

But I do think there are some things that could have used some more refinement. The round wooden tokens are too big. The implication is that the point track only goes up to 75 in a game where you easily score 150+ in your first game, and - more importantly - the round wooden token doesn't fit on the money track.
Then, the Icons depicting Abilities are more often than not pictures and not Icons. It took quite some time to familiarize those. A more abstract approach would have helped tremendously.

Grand Austria Hotel is a very good game with a lot of replay value. Beware that it can take a couple of games to learn it, especially as the English language rule book is not fit for purpose - a number of rules are poorly explained, leading to us playing our first game in a drastically different way to what the designer intended (we played more than two actions per player per round - nowhere in the rulebook is it stated that each player only has two actions per round). It was only after pouring through the bgg forums that I was able to piece together how passing works and clarify various other rules issues. Once you get past these rulebook issues, then you find a very engaging game that feels different each time, even with the beginner's variant of fixed groups of staff cards to start with. Playing with the flip sides of the hotel boards makes the game significantly more challenging. I still haven't managed to play the drafting variant, which I'm sure would make the game even better.

Longest downtime award winner! In 4 player game with even not so thinky players you can smoke more than two cigarettes between your turns. Game is also too long. What is more it is euro game with quite big random, and you can not plan a bigger plan, because there are too many random factors. Random clients, random stuff, random dice... Disappointment :(

What could have been a decent dice-as-workers drafting game completely falls apart due to poor pacing and a terrible turn structure. In a four player game the first player goes first and last, leading to immense downtime and very little agency.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one. For some reason I convinced myself that it just looked ok and so I wasn't in a rush to play it. I liked how between the three bonus point cards, the three emperor tiles, and your hand of six cards all being laid out at the beginning you can formulate a broad plan. But then the way the dice come out means that you can't just blindly execute your plan, you need to be able to stay flexible. But then the pass and re-roll action is there if the dice really hose you. That's a really cool balance. Also the way that you're collecting customers for their bonuses, but you also need to think about their colors for the set bonuses for completing blocks of rooms. I always really enjoy when in a game your choices affect multiple things and you need to balance those things. Also, I had success selectively ignoring the emperor track, which is good. I don't mind if a game makes you work towards some kind of upkeep cost, but I really like when it's somewhat optional and you can choose to ignore it. The employees were also pretty cool, but at least in my experience there are enough opportunities to play them as customer bonuses that taking the action to hire one seems rarely necessary.

Brilliant.  I generally don't fancy traditional euros (Saint Petersburg, Princes of Florence), but this one just clicks for me?  Frustrations: a couple of non-ideal translations in the rulebook (on what should have been easy concepts), and, as you know by now, 4 player is slow (however slow you're thinking, it's another 50% slower than that.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Grand Austria Hotel feels like a Stefan Feld classic, taking a concept featured in his games (roll dice to determine possible actions from which to choose) and enhancing it with decisions around gaining stronger actions with multiples of the same number and potentially having fewer (but different) options with a reroll. Combine these dynamic possibilities for actions with varying objectives, bonuses, and cards and the result is a game that might not always be perfectly balanced (and can lead to some long analysis paralysis), but provides a variety of gameplay experiences and victory paths to discover.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2017)

Last month I played Lorenzo il Magnigico from the same designers and I really liked it, so I was expecting  good game and I found one (is is better than Lorenzo il Magnifico). I generally like drafting dice games and Grand Austria Hotel is a winner in my book.

The rules of the game are pretty easy to teach. You can do in under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 100 minutes. The rulebook could be better in some places.

The theme isn’t exciting to me, but it is at least very different from many other euro games. Also, do you feel it through some of the game´s mechanisms.

The game´s components are of good quality. The art is good as well.

Best with 3 players, with 4 players there is too much downtime for the first player.

The game´s decisions are very interesting (which die should I pick?, that is, which action to do?, which staff to play, which guess to pick up, how to best fill up my hotel? which guest to serve?), there are many considerations and timing is very important as every action players do decreases in power after executing it. You need to accomplish a lot with very few actions, so the game is very tense from the beginning.

There are lots and lots of cards to explore so the replayability factor is very high. Also there are 12 political cards and 12 emperor tiles but you use only 3 each game also adding to the replayability.

The emperor scoring along the emperor tiles are rather similar to the church track on Lorenzo il Magnifico. I like it in both games, the penalties for failing them are harsh so they add a source of delicious tension to the game.

There is luck with the cards and the dice, but I feel its impact is rather low. You see many guess cards during the game but the staff cards have considerable luck. There are ways to add a die temporally to an action, to reroll the dice and the 6 number allows you to perform any other action so the luck factor of the dice is low.

Bottom line, Grand Austria Hotel is a solid Euro game. The luck factor of the dice is low, there is much higher luck with the cards but I like it a lot and I want to play it again soon. Good game.

Bought on impulse with birthday cash... now to see if it lives up to the hype.  Played one game solo to understand the rules.  Initial impression is a favourable 8.

Finally played the game with 4 and another game with 2 players.  It appears to scale very well.  The staff player aids (in the files section) are almost a requirement for the first few games until you understand all the icons used.  A few more positive plays and my rating might go up.

This is a great two player game! I haven't played with a higher player count (from what I understand the down time can be to long); but with two the turns come around quick. I like the helpers and the ways they help and the many different ways to victory. Keeping an eye on achievements and getting them first can also add a layer to the game. The game allows for a bit of a solo puzzle feel while encouraging you too keep an eye on your oponent(s).
It's just the right amount of thinking when you want to think but not too hard.

2016-07-11 - I don't think I have played a dice drafting game before this one, but the mechanism is so elegant that I'm surprised it hasn't been around forever. At this point, I've played one 2 player game of Grand Austria Hotel and found it to be well designed, interesting, and fun, and I would happily play it again. I don't think it's one I'm likely to buy, though, as I think the 2 player game suffers from being a little underpowered, and the game didn't give me any particular desire to play it again right away.

2017-07-03 - I wanted to like this because of the designers, but I just don't think it's that great. Lowering my rating to a 6.

Only one play, but I really enjoyed it a lot! The first play is definitely going to run long, even with only 2 players. I highly recommend NOT playing with 4 or even 3 players until everyone is comfortable with the flow of the game.

There is so much to love about this game, but I fear some of the errors and questions left open in the rules may end up knocking it down for me just a bit. I tend to be unforgiving of rules that are not near perfect.

Also, the price for the component quality is a bit steep; the cards are especially thin.

RATING: 7
In Grand Austria Hotel, players are hotel owners inviting customers into their cafes where they try to serve them per their specifications so that they will book a room and start to fill the hotel. After optionally drafting a customer card, players draft a die in order to take the associated action. The start player rolls all of the dice and they are broken down by number. Each number is a different action and the number of dice of that number makes the action more powerful. But each action taken removes a die, making subsequent actions less powerful, which is a structure that makes this a game not suitable for more than 3 players. The difference between player 1 and player 4 is just too great. The actions allow you to collect food and drink to please your guests, prepare rooms for guests, use staff cards from your hand, or get money or emperor points. The flow of how to get points is straightforward - draft customers to your cafe, prepare rooms in your hotel, serve the food and drinks your customers require, and book them too your rooms to fill as much of your hotel as possible. Many of these steps can generate points along the way.

So, lots and lots of drafting to manage your needs. The game features plenty of special actions on cards that you need to leverage, so everyone takes a slightly different path to get to their end points. Really enjoyable 2-player euro. I could see myself scoring this higher by a point if it holds up over repeated plays.

Game is very interesting, with many possibilities to chain abilities together. However, it is not very forgiving, so the first game can feel quite miserable since the slightest mistep is punished. The use of dice is very nice, since it rewards the player who plans well and is flexible no matter the dice.

Game is somewhat fiddly with regards to points tracking, as you can easily forget if you added points or not for triggered abilities.

RATING: 7
[floatleft][ImageID=2728138][/floatleft]I was a bit disappointed by this game. My expectations were high and perhaps a bit misguided. I've been spoiled by Euro games with dice which manage to overcome their variability enough to create wonderfully tense and challenging medium weigh strategy games, for example [thing=84876]The Castles of Burgundy[/thing] and [thing=73439]Troyes[/thing]. Grand Austria Hotel allows luck to play a more significant role, which shifts the game more towards the lighter side of things, but retains a lot of planning and AP inducing options which are a bit out of place in a game where so much is decided by the roll of the dice.

The game is played over 7 rounds, each round you roll 2N+6 dice (standard d6's) and sort them by their faces, where N is the number of players. Each value corresponds to an action. Players take turns selecting a die and performing the action, the strength of the action depends on the number of dice present with the corresponding value. Once finished with the action the die is removed from the board. Players take actions in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4 then 4, 3, 2, 1. The intention is to compensate the later players for having fewer choices, however this can fail pretty miserably and introduces another big problem in the game, downtime! Since there is quite a bit of planning and things to think about turns can take a minute or two, leaving player 1 a lot of time to twiddle her thumbs after her first action. Nothing keeps players involved when it isn't their turn. I say the turn order doesn't compensate the later players, and it isn't hard to see why. If the distribution is spiky (which it is wont to do) the first couple of players can take a very strong action leaving the later players with less spectacular options. The answer, of course, is for these players to roll nice spiky distributions themselves, helpfully in the action they most want to do, but we all know how that will likely turn out. The game is simply not long enough for this random element to have a good chance of evening out. To make things just a bit worse you can also draw into strong synergies in the staff cards. Again, you don't draw a lot of these cards during the game, so a fortunate combination can set someone significantly ahead.

[center][ImageID=2649933 medium][/center]

All of that said, it is not necessary that these issues cause the game to be bad. I was just surprised by them because I was expecting a more strategic game, and make no mistake there are some truly wonderful things to crunch on and noodle around in your brain. You just have to be willing to let things slide if your victory or loss is delivered by the roll of the dice or the draw of a card. With that in mind, the game can be a joy to play. Especially once everyone at the table is experienced and the game can be played at a fast pace. The game just barely justifies a 90 minute playtime, for that reason a lot of people have been suggesting playing with no more than 3p. I think 4p would be fine as long as people know what they're doing.

A big plus is the amount of variability there is between games. There are public goals and reward/punishment tiles which change between games. Each goal awards 15/10/5 VP for the 1st/2nd/3rd player to fulfill its condition. The reward/punishment tiles demand that you advance up the emperor track to ever increasing levels to earn the reward, if you fail you get punished. Suffering these can be part of a winning strategy which is always good in my books. Finally there is a lot of variety in the staff cards you end up with, these can really help sculpt your strategy.

All together a very nice game which has too much luck to take too seriously, but when seen for what it is can be a lot of fun.

RATING: 6
Grand Austria Hotel is a typical gamers’ game. Many subsystems, multiple ways to score VPs, lots of cards and special abilities to provide variability. Unluckily, I don’t see anything raising it from the average game in this genre while being the usual hodgepodge of mechanisms. 

My main trouble boils down to the employee cards. The winner in our game only got two, one of them (the waiter) being so powerful that it solved all his money problems while being ridiculously cheap. Afterwards, we calculated that he got thrice the benefit I could have gotten from a similarly priced card under best circumstances. In fact, he got six times the benefit I got in play. He won by a large margin. It’s a pity to see one of the main subsystems relegated in value. Much ado about nothing? I’m reminded of the role cards in Rattus where a strong strategy is to avoid them completely.

[Edit: Turned out that one rule got explained wrong which explained the extraordinary strength of this card. Still not sure though, if the employee card system is as relevant as it's supposed to be]

It can be a merciless game when the dice don’t fall the way you need for your customer cards or to earn money. Mitigation is possible to some degree but luck will have it that some players don’t have to worry about mitigating unlucky rolls and can bring in VPs without any hassle. I wouldn’t want to play it with four players as due to the Settlers-inspired turn order the waiting time will be prohibitive for the player starting a round.

Downtime can be a serious issue with the game, And AP can seriously make the downtime way worse too.  The rulebook is absolutely awful. It's one of the worst books I've ever struggled with. It is filled with an nconsistency of terms, references the wrong pages, using really nebulous terms for things that aren't described, it's an absolute mess. I'm suspecting there was little care and effort into the English translation. The fact that the iconography isn't particularly well done or intuitive doesn't help either.

BUT... the game is fabulous. It has a lot of layers. Aside from what I've mentioned as negatives, I think everything else within it is about as close to perfect as it gets.  

As a 4-player game, this is a 5. As a 3-player game, this is a 7. As a 2-player game, this is a 9.

Very slow at 4 players..almost everyone would be on their phones when it wasn't their turn since for the most part it's a solitaire game other than what order/action you take BUT the game was a lot of fun despite that and it has some awesome comboing. It is a great feeling when you trigger a huge chain for spending only one action (although spending numerous free actions). Nice theme, nice art. I definitely have a soft spot for this one and I'm sure it's unlikely but I'd love to see an expansion with themed asymmetric starting hotel companies (more than the room layouts)

GAH is an excellent, thematic euro that plays really well with 2 players. Money and action economy is very tight.

Egyáltalán nem volt rossz játékélmény, de különösebben jó sem. Az egy dolog, hogy a téma igazából nem annyira vonzó számomra, de mechanikailag sem volt semmi olyasmi, ami nagyon megfogott volna. Négyesben ráadásul rettenetesen sok volt a holtidő. Az ilyen összetettségű játékoknál reális szokott lenni a 30 perc/fő, de itt elég kevés akció fér bele ebbe az időbe. Az ikonozás is elég rettenetes, sajnos itt is feláldozták a "nyelvfüggetlenség" kedvéért az egyértelmű utasításokat, így viszont sokszor bele-bele kell nézni a szabálykönyvbe. Ilyen jellegű eurókból azért van jópár, és olyanból is nem kevés létezik, amit inkább játszanék, mint a Grand Austria Hotelt.

Can be a very rewarding or very frustrating experience. Great game, but can feel limiting based on the available die. There's also a lot of randomness to the game which I'm not always the biggest fan of. At the end of the game, you usually feel like you never did enough, or that one more turn would've been perfect. Emperor track can be punishing. Theme is great though and just makes sense with the type of game it is.

A solid Euro in the same vein as Rococo. Serpentine player order means player 1 will be waiting awhile for their second turn. Mechanically solid, but can be punishing and a little restrictive, especially the emperor track.

RATING: 4
The game has the following characteristics:
Fiddly: I like this, but many don not.
Long wait between turns: play with people who can entertain themselves / you between turns.
Group Solitaire: There is no direct interaction between players. At most, one can try to take something that they think another player will want.
No catch-up Mechanic: Players who fall behind have no way to catch up. The winner if the game is known on turn 3 (of 7)
Win-More: There are endless opportunities for the lead player to get further into the lead.

Neat game with huge design flaws. Will not play again unless pressured.

This has become a favourite to solo. The guest and staff cards provide enormous replayability and there are enough moving parts in the emperor and politics tracks to keep you occupied. It's a medium-weight game with an interesting dice placement mechanic all of which, because I'm actually not all that good at gaming, makes it perfect for me.

Earlier note:
The visit from the emperor should be a visit by health and safety. Otherwise a surprisingly fun and complete game.

Also have Cafe Melange, Elevenses and The Jam.

Played this with four players, which clearly was a mistake. The downtime was awful. With the small amount of actions each player took, this game was ridiculously long. It felt like the game was too hard to strategize in because too much luck was involved with the dice rolls.

Let's start with the facts: THIS SHOULD BE 2 PLAYER GAME.
Because otherwise... It's the worst experience in a long time! The game itself might deserve a couple of points more, but if you play Hotel Austria with 4 players, this is the best I can give. Why? Because of the long waiting times. First of all, the game turns goes like this: player 1, player 2, player 3, player 4, player 4, player 3, player 2, player 1. One turn can take easily 1 minute (sometimes even more) so if you are the first player it takes 6 more minutes before it's your turn again AND what's best/worst is that the player before you can ruin your plans totally and you'll have to think your moves again (which why sometimes turns takes even more time). So the BIGGEST ISSUE here is: Why the hell they'll put 2-4 players in the box, if it's supposed to be played with just 2 players? Because this is at max 2 player game. The theme here is good, the art is okay and all sounded quite fun before we tried it. So... this was the biggest miss for me so far what comes to Essen games from 2016.

RATING: 7.2
Following on the footsteps of games like Fresco or, more obviously, Rococo, this is just like another 2015 eurogame title, Shakespeare, in creating a "thematic complex Eurogame" where you still "build" cards using different-colored cubes and these cards give you extra actions, only medieval construction is not that popular anymore, so you "build people" (ie satisfy their needs) now. And it succeeds to some extent: just like Shakespeare, it uses known mechanism elements and everything remains in Eurogame territory but it still supports the theme.
In some ways this game feels like the best Stefan Feld game that was not designed by stefan Feld, using a clever (mostly, Yspahan-like) central mechanism for action selection (the closest Feld to this action selection is Bora Bora) then build some usual eurogame stuff on it, including constructing special ability cards (okay, fulfilling the needs of your guests and hiring staff), placing tiles and scoring in a few ways for their groupings (tidying the rooms for guests, then accomodating them there) and also having the trademark Stefan Feld secondary track (pleasing the Emperor), very usual stuff for Feld, only it's not designed by Feld. 
What makes some difference however is that the staff cards are rather strong, not game-breakingly, but they are really strong, which reminded me of Marco Polo (one of the designers is the same) in a positive way.
Klemens Franz's artwork is clear and fun, although I felt like he had more fun with creating the numerous insider references on the guest cards (referring not only to himself but also the designers' previous designs like E. Gizia and Marco Polo) than I did but whatever, it's probably more on the positive side, while the staff occupation names are on the negative side, almost unreadable.
In the end, I quite liked the game, it was quite fun, the theme was captured quite fine, it was quite engaging, although downtime was sometimes quite long, and you have to focus on administration quite a lot. So... Quite good, but not as great as I hoped from others' comments.

Rating based on one three player game.

With 4 players there can be too much down time as in between your turns, I recommend max. three players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Plays well at all player counts. Probably prefer with 3 due to reduced down time but if you play with AP prone people, this will drag a bit regardless.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Really enjoyed my first play despite the considerable downtime waiting for people to make their decisions. One has to make the best of 14 actions in the game along with any free actions based on the roll of a group of dice that apply to everyone (although action quantity decreases as a person takes a die for the action). Tense and challenging decisions and one mistake will cost you the game (as I found out). Don't mistakenly take a customer and realize that you have no room for him later! Quite tactical but one must also keep long term goals in mind and not deviate too far outside.

May well compete with Troyes for me as a favorite dice-centric game.

There were a coupld design choices I didn't care for so much including a score track that only goes to 75 looping around the board and then using a disk to mark your current money on hand which can easily be knocked off and is perhaps slightly too large as well.

It's rare that a new Eurogame comes around that I actually enjoy. Even more rare is that I played a Mayfair game that I actually enjoyed. Of course I would have enjoyed this game even more had Mayfair spent the time to translate a lot of the components fully instead of keeping them in their High German. I love theme in games, but if you make a decision on theme that makes the game more difficult to play you are going about it in the wrong way. Overall the game play is pretty simple, and isn't all that revolutionary. I enjoyed the theme of the game, and it was integrated well into the mechanics for the most part. Some of the rules weren't the best, and the game suffers from the usual too many icons to do a million different things that started with Race for the Galaxy. The artwork was nice, and other than the issues I mentioned above the components were nice. I just wish another publisher had gotten the rights to do this one in English. Mayfair really is terrible.

Coming in at the back of my Top 50 is Grand Austria Hotel, a game I declined to try at BGGcon last year because it looked kind of blah. Big mistake because it turns out that it's great. There were two main highlights that sets it apart from other games: the way that you do the action as many times as there are dice on the space when you take that action, and the way that the resources work where you have to take at least as much of one resource as the other. It builds in scarcity of some of the resources in a way that I haven't seen much in other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It has a very strong Castles of Burgundy vibe: using dice as actions, two actions per turn, putting tiles down, finishing areas, chaining bonuses... and yet it manages to be a completely different game. It can get a bit brain-burning towards the end.

The dice-drafting mechanic is refreshing because it encourages grabbing the actions with most dice (as opposed to most other games where you get the rare ones).

I would avoid this with more than 2 players due to downtime and disruption of plans (although to be fair, I haven't played it with more than 2). Update: I played it at 3 and it was fine, but it didn't add anything over just 2 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Excellent 2 player game.  As a 2p game this is a 10.  As a 3 player it is probably also a 10 or a 9.  However, I don't think I would want to play this with 4 players based on how the turn order works.

As a 2 player game this is fantastic and one of my favorites.

RATING: 5
While the mechanism with the dice taking and turn order is fine, I don't like the randomness of the draw with the guests and with 4 players, 7 rounds is a really bad number. 8 would be better in that case. (actually 7 is never a great number, I think). 
Also waiting time is pretty long as starting player when you have to wait for 6 actions till it's your turn again.

You attract customers to you hotel with dinners and they then stay at the hotel.  You have to prep rooms for them.  The main mechanism is a dice rolling mechanism similar to Yspahan that I like.  The game was good.  It was a bit abstract.  But the art is good and the game is fun.  The only issue I have is that the rules are poor and the documentation for the cards is terrible.  They use a cursive script for German words and it makes it difficult to lookup names of cards when learning the game.  Symbols are easy to understand if you have a player that knows them though.  

It is a solid game that could have been really great if not for poor rules and bad graphic design choices.

[b][thing=182874][/thing][/b] has too much randomness.  The dice, of course, are one source.  But then there are two decks of cards: the Guests and the Employees.  Some of the randomness is removed from the former because six are face up for selection, but the latter all come off the top of the deck.  Drafting at the start of the game does mitigate this somewhat.  Nevertheless, it all adds up to make [b][thing=182874][/thing][/b] a very tactical game with a good measure of luck.

First impression after one 2p game.  Good production values -- I personally like the graphics and art direction, it is enjoyable to look at while playing.  The rulebook could be improved, some information is unclear or hidden.  With 2 players the downtime is minimal, in fact the game flows along at an enjoyable brisk pace that also allows for table talk.  The game is almost entirely MPS.  There is a little bit of interaction in the form of racing to objectives, and taking away limited resources (dice), but overall the play is very insular.  Oddly enough, even though I usually don't like MPS games I enjoyed this one -- the variability of every round, the lightness of the theme/art, the low level of confrontation, and the lack of having to focus on the other player plays makes this an enjoyable alternative for times when you want to play a 2p game that is almost non-confrontational, more of a shared puzzle with some snowballing engine building.  Remains to be seen with repeated plays whether this game has a runaway leader problem that would reduce the entertainment even of the MPS aspect.
Personally, as an MPS, I would put this on par with Terraforming Mars.

It definitely stands out. The idea feels kind of basic; classic goods/delivery mechanics, that suddenly turns into brain burning optimization problem.

Too much of a point salad for my tastes, all these bonuses and extras chaining into each other.

More negatives than positives on this one. Good theme and neat way of filling up your rooms for getting an extra bonus, but the game fell flat for me.

Have to try Lorenzo next .

Grand Austria Hotel is ok. I don't feel that there's anything very novel going on. It has a bit of theme, insomuch that the mechanics meld with the goals and game concepts.

I've seen a lot of users say this replaced CoB for them and I was glad to see I don't agree.

Make your hotel better than anyone else's. Draft guests, feed them, and send them to a prepared room. Plays over 7 rounds in which you get only 2 actions picked from a pool of rolled dice (strength of the action determined by the number of dice showing that number). Plays well 2 or 3 best with 4 over about 90 minutes.

Reminds me a bit of Macao & Bruges, but much more enjoyable.  Plenty of card combo play along with dice action selection.

I'm afraid this may be following the path a majority of other euros do for me: after 10-15 plays, I start to lose interest in playing it.  I just had my 14th play and it was pretty dull to me.  Really enjoy the combo-y game play of the guests, but not enough to overcome my dislike of the emperor track.  I'm normally not a big fan of games that have a punishment element that you need to account for (think feeding your family in Agricola).  At first the emperor track was sort of entertaining since it gave a little extra in the game to think about.  After several more plays, I just can't stand it.  I'd rather have an all out combo-fest instead of having to account for the emperor.  Clearly my problem and not the game's problem.  I still had quite a few fun plays, but it may be time for this game to move on to someone else's shelf.

I really like it. It feels different. Sort of reminds me of Last Will, but that's the closest I can come to a comparison in terms of "feel." I think I will hold onto it being that it plays so well with 2. 

Update 5/21/16:

After 2 plays, I like this a bit more. The only real complaint I have is the lack of indexing within the rulebook. If you are going to go heavy on iconography, make that iconography accessible somewhere. Unacceptable. That said, this doesn't diminish my enjoyment of the game, at least not majorly. I like how the dice work here. I still think it feels a bit like Last Will, but the "hotel" player board is what separates it and makes it a different experience. I think once I get used to the iconography, this one could continue to climb. It might need more cards eventually. We'll see.

Fun game that plays extremely well two player.  Gf immediately requested another play.  Solid mechanics reminiscent of Castles of Burgundy.  Not as strategy heavy, but has some fun thematic play.  I like that there are multiple strategies available... Set bonuses, Emperor Track, Staff Cards, etc.

Update 1/18/16.  Increased rating from 8.5 to 9.  Played with 4 players at Board of Games Tustin.  4 Players went over well.  Since there was nobody AP prone, the turns went by quickly and the large downtime wasn't noticeable.  In fact, there was very little downtime at all.  The game was well enjoyed by all and I'm loving how different each game can feel with variable goals and emperor bonuses (ABC).

Reminds me in different ways of Voyages of Marco Polo, Yspahan, Castles of Burgundy, and Zhanguo.

Grand Austria Hotel is much more tactical than Marco Polo, but similar in that there isn't enough time to accomplish everything, in the availability of optional bonus actions, and in the chaining of actions (this chaining is also what makes me think of CoB).

The dice selection mechanic is similar to Yspahan except that you don't take the entire pool of a pip value. You just take one die and get activations equal to the number of dice of that value. You can also pay a buck for an extra activation or use a 6 for a buck and have it act as a 1-5. Lastly, you can pass and reroll all the dice (minus one) once other players have taken their turns (if nothing you want is available or if you really need an exact quantity of something and the risk/reward of gambling on a pass makes sense).

The three random public goals that pay 15/10/5 VP for the 1st/2nd/3rd player to complete remind me of similar goals in Zhanguo. These goals, along with each player's personal staff cards will steer your strategy in a different direction each game.

This one seems to be flying under the radar because it doesn't play well with four players. While this is true because of the snaking of turn order (the first player in a four player game will have the 1st and 8th actions of a round -- enough time to grab a bite to eat between turns), the game plays well with 2-3 players. Also, if the snaking bothers you, the designer stated you can play without it and simply have players start with different amounts of cash to compensate.

----------

After two plays, I'm at a rating of 7 (though it could rise to an 8). The game is almost too tactical and multi-player solitaire for my tastes, and I tend to be into those sorts of games. The game's saving grace is the random setup of A/B/C tiles/cards along with the starting staff cards (which should definitely be drafted, by the way). This does give you a bit of a game plan at the start of the game.

After Marco Polo and Grand Austria Hotel, I look forward to the designer's next effort.

Update: upgraded. This is a very nice game indeed, very good design, very tight. The only minus point I can think is that it plays quite solitary. Normally interaction is important for me, but in this game there is enough challenge and puzzle to optimize your personal score, so it doesn't bother me here. I would only play this with 2 or 3 players as downtime will become an issue otherwise, given the turn order mechanism.

Excellent game of planning. Action selection through dice. Many ways to score points. Thematically well done too. I would like to play this game more often.

A fantastic 2p game! I wasn't impressed after reading the rules as it looks like just another mid weight dice drafting game, but I'm happy to say my initial concerns have been entirely overturned by actually playing the game.

It's incredibly thematic, with easy rules and is very slick with 2 players. The game just flies past. It's really fun to build your game engine and pull together some really smart, efficient turns by using the dice and card bonuses together. Efficient use of your turn is the order of the day.

The staff and guest cards, along with the emperor and end game bonus tiles provide a lot of variability.I think there's plenty of space to try out different strategies.

The components are of high quality and the artwork is great. All in all this is a very fun and hugely thematic game. Ideal for 2 players. I do have concerns about game length and down time playing it with 3 or 4, though. I probably wouldn't want to try with 3 or 4 tbh.

This is a very good euro with interesting mechanics. I like the dice drafting, the  cards with special abilities and the puzzle of matching the right guests with the different colour rooms. It is a great game with two, I will never consider playing it with more than that. I especially like the theme and aetwork of the game, nicely done. Overall a great game that ia hard to play really well.

This game, and also Twilight Struggle, are INCREDIBLY well-suited to a thematic playlist creating an ambiance unparalleled by any computer or video game. 

This game is simply rolling dice to decide the actions available in a turn, while running our competing pre-WWI Viennese hotels. Gotta get the guests fed coffee and cake (or wine and strudel), and then occupying a prepped hotel room. All while doing our best to keep the Emperor happy each of the 3 phases. Delightful, and never have I ever enjoyed the Emperor Waltz (and the like) quite so much as with this game on the table.

Wow, what a lot going on! Money is tight, the Emperor track is unforgiving, and there is so much you want to cram into each of your turns. With only 14 turns in the whole game, optimization and economy are king. I enjoy this game very much and would recommend for fans of The Castles of Burgundy - though with the warning that, unlike TCoB, you don't have an opportunity to do something good in every turn. Some turns are just crushing failures, and that's why I love it.

Play length is fantastic for two players, though the game almost defines "multiplayer solitaire". 

EDIT: Rating of this game just keeps going up. The more I play, the more I enjoy it.

There is a lot going on in this.  You've got a long chain of events you have to successfully put together.  Manage dice->get customers->get goods->ready rooms->fill rooms.  Once you get a couple rounds into it, it all starts to flow together.  As with any dice game, there are some random quirky rounds occasionally, but given some provided dice mitigation options, these rarely impact things significantly.  Overall, I really liked this one.  With repeated plays it may climb a good bit higher.

What a superb, tight, and elegant game, especially for two players. The cards might suffer from minor imbalances, but there are many opportunities for creative thinking and opportunistic play. Grand Austria Hotel is colorful, amusing, light-hearted and dead serious. We've been playing it almost nightly for the last few weeks. There are a surprising variety of situations and many possibilities for creative play. I wouldn't want to play this with more than 2 however!

Let me start with the "bad", the game can suffer from a Downtime issue if you are the kind of player that is disengaged from the game when it's not your turn, if you only think about what you are doing and going to do in your next turn and are only waiting for others to finish their turn... 
If you are like that this game will have a big issue, specially in a 4P game... in a 3P the issue will be there too, not has bad but it will be there... in a 2P game I don't see this being an issue...

That being said, the game is AWESOME!!!

I really like dice pool action selection games, like La Granja, My Village and Panamax to name a few, where you roll a bunch of dice at the start of the round and that determines what actions can be performed by the players... really love this mechanic and Grand Austria Hotel uses it extraordinarily well

But that's not all... you'll also have Staff cards, these are cards that you can play by taking the action of hiring Staff and paying the cost of the staff on the card and they will provide you with a special power or end game bonus scoring... the powers can be permanent, once per round or once per game.
The game starts with the players drafting these Staff Cards around the table to get their 6 starting Staff cards... I love drafting games and this is a pretty cool feature here also because you can try to form some combos with the Staff cards you end up with.
There are several ways to get more staff cards into your hand during the game.

I love the art and presentation of the game, so for me, this is one of the best games of this year... not terribly complex,but a lot to take into consideration and if you want to play it well you have to carefully plan and use you actions...
Money can be extremely tight if you aren't careful!!

Love it!

This is fun but tough.. This could be amazing with some tweaking but unfortunately there are problems with the game that can not be ignored and affect the experience in a negative way..

*This game is harsh and unforgiving, if you have a bad start due to draw/turn order/generally not getting what you need or making a bad decision early on, that's pretty much game over for you and you just have to keep receiving punch after punch while your opponent keeps getting rewarded until the end..      
*Card imbalance in hotel helper deck, meaning there is a great luck factor with the draw.. Played several games where a card was drawn that scored them twenty + points..This wouldn't be a huge problem but the main objective to aim for only score you 15 points max and can take the whole game to achieve..   
*loAds of errors and unclear rules in the rule book + cheap components which is unforgivable with a game that costs £50.. Money grabbing production makes be soooo angry..

A good solid euro. Really interesting planing, with high satisfaction when you get things just right to fill those color areas up and please the emperor while not running out of money.

Only knock I have against it is that it is a little too solitaireish, but I don't mind. The staff cards might be unbalanced as well. But overall it is good.

Deep game with a large variety of play styles thanks to the randomised emperor's favour tiles and the goal cards. I really like the dice drafting mechanic to trigger actions and the idea that you can win with various goal choices. The staff mixes things up nicely and I like the turn order for 2 players. I've not yet played it with more than 2 players, but I suspect it might feel a little slow when you go first and then have to wait 4 turns before you can do anything.

Who would have thought that a game about a hotel would be good? Not me!  Solid euro game dice selection/allocation game.  Even though the theme is boring (for me), the game is quite good.  If I didn't already own so many other very good games, I would definitely be picking this one up.

This game has quite a bite to it, but I'm really happy to see Simone design another game I enjoy after a period of drought since Tzolk'in. This game is surprisingly quick, but due to limited actions and finances, it can really be a struggle to do well. I like the dice drafting quite a bit. I expected it to be similar to Panamax, but it actually reminds me more of Yspahan. Much like Tzolk'in, Grand Austria Hotel has some depth to it. It's not a game you'll do well at on your first play, but once you're familiar with everything, it becomes a really engaging Euro where actions are precious and money is tight. The only area that feels a bit awkward is the player scaling. With 2, there aren't nearly as many options to consider, but with 4, the game runs on pretty long. I think I'd probably prefer to play with 4, despite the long downtime, only because you have more actions to consider through more dice.

Replaces Panamax and Yspahan for me.

UPDATE: Played this again recently, and it hasn't held up all that well. I still think it's better than the aforementioned games, but the problems I had before continue to be more pronounced. Either you play with more players and the downtime is too much, or you play with less and the dice pool is too small. This game punishes you from the get go, and you're constantly under pressure the whole way through. Also, I think La Granja does the same thing in a better way.

Plays easily, although the iconography on the staff cards might be better done for clarity.  Still, once referenced and understood the rest of the game plays quite fluidly.  Requires careful attention, particularly in the closing rounds where it's unlikely you'll get as many actions as you'd like.

[b]Scaling: 1/5[/b] Gonna get this out of the way first. Boy oh boy scaling in this game is terrible. 2 players is great! 3 players is alright. 4 players is unbearably god awful. The snaking turn order is unique, and provides an experience like very few other board games provide. Unfortunately, the idea is cool on paper and with very little thought, because the first player may have the board change completely before they get to go again on turn 8. But whoever gets that first player tiles is going to be in a world of boredom for quite a while if people aren't paying attention to the game.

[b]Scoring: 3/5[/b] I think that end game scoring is mildly overpowered depending on what people get. It rubs me the wrong way that someone can get quite a few staff cards that work well together just because the guests they satisfy let them draw them, and then they get to score the same few doors over and over and over again. I had an experience recently where I was objectively doing a better job, and got two 15 points objectives whereas nobody else got a single one, I was leading significantly, and then someone shot through the victory point stratosphere on end game scoring alone. I'm not going to pretend that I only ever want to play games that are pure skill, because that can be a pain, but the staff cards are really annoying in this game if someone has some that work for them. You can draft the cards to mitigate this, but... again, staff cards are drawn throughout the game depending on guest abilities, so there's not much that can be done.

[b]Mechanics: 4/5[/b] The dice drafting isn't anything incredibly new, but I don't think any game has done it exactly like this. Even Ysphan, which is the most relatable game I can think of, is slightly different in the way it works. This game is quite a bit less lucky than a dice game would be expected to be, but you'll still roll poorly sometimes and it will be a problem

[b]Theme: 4/5[/b]: The theme doesn't show extremely heavily, but it's unique and shows enough that it's a positive quality. I enjoy getting guests, getting the food they want, and placing them in the rooms they want.

[b]Extra incentives: 5/5[/b] I honestly think the emperor points make this game much better, and usually those extra arbitrary incentives in other games are a problem. Here, it works well to motivate you to get do other actions or grab other guests you otherwise wouldn't. These emperor actions aren't always devastating either, so you can weigh you pros against the cons.

an insta-fave. Shades of Agricola / Panamax / Feld. Love it that the game permits only 14 total turns over the course of the entire session, yet so much can happen based on chained bonuses.

it just features the things I like: euro with dice, tableau building, luck with mitigation, funky turn ordering. What is difficult: the iconography, at first; and this thing in the latest euros of seemingly unbalancing superpower abilities (staff cards), so a winning strategy seems to require organizing around the strengths so conferred. Only it is quite nearly up to luck of the draw alone whether or not you can even get more than the starting hand of staff cards.

loads of fun, but a runaway winner scenario often occurs, and the factors undergirding such a scenario come down to luck of the draw (same exact situation as Bruges)

Interesting combo-based game with some intriguing card interactions.  However, this game has a lot of issues.

When you have a great game, in which your cards all line up just right and the right guests come out, you have a great time.

If you play well, but your servants don't line up with the goals or your tactical play, the wrong guests come up in the wrong order, and you end up with cash flow issues, you might as well just give up.  The "emperor track" in particular can be very, very punishing to players who run into short-term problems.

Either way, you have to deal with painful downtime in a four-player game (especially if you are going first and eight in the same round -- hope you have a hobby).  Plus, the card quality is very poor; the sides of our cards are fraying after only a few plays. I would recommend getting sleeves.

I suspect I will play this about 10 times and then get sick of it.  With experienced players who understand the combos and which of the servant cards are actually useful, it will come down to lucky draws and rolls rather than good play to decide who wins.

Some nice features in this one, but an awful lot of fiddling and downtime. I don't normally mind multiplayer solitaire-type games, but this is stretching the limit. Still, the combo-making is fun while remaining manageable: something which isn't always achieved well.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]
[i]Looking back on my thoughts I'm surprised I haven't played this again, but I will not play with more than two so I've never joined a game at our meet up sine it's almost always 3+ players.

My original thoughts some up my feelings on this game quite well and while I'd like to play again I'd basically have to relearn the game and I'm not sure that I'm really looking forward to that. Also the game play experience really doesn't differ much from other games I already enjoy (like Agricola or La Granja), if I'm going to invest time in a new game I want there to be mechanisms that differentiate itself from the games I already know and enjoy. This year Trickerion and Feast for Odin are both games I keep playing because they offer a fresh experience and don't feel like a rehash of mechanics in a new skin. I'm sure part of this is how long I've been in the hobby and it takes a bit more for me to really get excited about a new game.[/i]

 [COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]- I love how punishing this game is, this game makes you plan ahead and the payoff is awesome.
- The huge variety of shared scoring goals, customers and servants will add a ton of variety from game to game.
- I really enjoy the spacial aspect of laying out your hotel and the fact that each board is different on one side.
- I would only recommend this with 2 unless you like to sit and wait.

I managed to play 2 games back to back with my buddy Mat. Playing twice really put this game into perspective for me. My first play I was hitting on all cylinders and barely missed breaking 150. I was efficient and made all the right choices with the customers I was picking and servants I was hiring. The second game I made one huge mistake early (I chose the wrong customer and couldn't generate any income) and I never really recovered. I barely broke 75 points for that game. That said I love the game and don't mind how punishing it is, but this is definitely a game that you need to play multiple times to see how everything works and make sure you are managing all the different aspects of the game without falling behind in any of them. 

Playing Grand Austria Hotel actually felt a lot like playing Agricola in terms of having to manage so many different moving parts and making sure you are planning ahead in order to have big turns where you are able to complete the different public and private scoring objectives. Add to that how punishing the emperor track can be if you don't plan for it (similar to feeding workers in Agricola) and you have a very unforgiving game. Also, while our second game went pretty quick I wouldn't want to play this with more than 2. This game is a giant puzzle and adding more players wouldn't make the game more enjoyable, just longer.

I would definitely add Grand Austria Hotel to our collection if I thought it would get a lot of play. However since it scratches a similar itch to Agricola I'm not sure if it would get played. I know for a fact that the farming theme will carry the day with my son, but maybe he'd surprise and enjoy this game too. In fact I am surprised by how much he enjoys Concordia since it is such a dry game, so maybe I'll take a chance on this one. In the meantime I hope my buddy Mat enjoys it as much as I do and it becomes part of the rotation when looking for heavier Euros to play.[/i]

You know you really love a game when you played it five times in a weekend. In Grand Austria Hotel, each player operates a luxurious Western European hotel, bringing guests into their cafés and then their stately rooms. With only fourteen turns to "draft dice," strategy and efficiency becomes key. Of course, within these turns, there are multiple chances for "chaining," using additional actions, game-breaking "staff" cards, and rewards to make you feel accomplished. There is so much working in the game's favor for an enjoyable game day: a clear and concise rule set with room for variability and replay. Grand Austria Hotel is a tight game, but I believe that's where the fun is: obtaining as many points as possible with only two moves per round and avoiding as many penalties, too. And, really, isn't that the sign of every good Euro?

For a Euro medley, it's surprised me a little on the upside. It's a melange of Yspahan-like dice actions, Agricola-like starting hand to help drive your strategic direction, on a foundation of cube collection to satisfy drafted card requirements. A successful result depends on getting continual side-benefits from completing those cards so that you don't have to waste actions on ancillary things like money or advancing up tracks. This does admittedly feel a bit same-y from game to game. But the draft choices have also became more interesting with replay. Which makes me wonder how luck-driven the end result is (the dice for starters and whether the actions you want are available in strength, and then the cards that are available to you on your turn). There's some neat mechanics around the dice re boosting and passing for a re-roll. The staff cards and the different objectives each game drive inter-game replayability, and there's an attraction in managing the luck. The game is otherwise sandbox-y, which I like because there's already enough luck to manage without having to manage conflictual luck as well. So far it's wearing well as shelf fodder but without being a standout.

Played twice. I don't think anyone would or should have the patience to slog through this mess. My doctor gave me three shots for iconitis and I still have an ugly rash.

  I have played some heavy games like Madeira and mombasa and I can tell you that those games are a piece of cake compared to learning this. The iconography makes race for the galaxy look like a cakewalk.  While my temperature went to 400°, I spent four hours in the oven going back-and-forth between player aids and the rules, trying to decipher the cards. Think about it: mayfair charges $80 and then relies on BGG members to post fixes in the form of homemade player aids. Now there's a company I can support! 

The cards are also flimsy and I almost creased one while shuffling. There's no way this game should cost $80. They could have at least included ultra pro sleeves. It's half baked. In serious need of a complete rules rewrite, proofread and translation. Which idiot decided that minuscule fonts in handwriting script was a good idea to name each staff card, in GERMAN, and then put descriptions of each card in the rulebook without a photo of the card?  I'd like to meet this person so I can slap the strudel out of him. Even antman had a hard time deciphering them. Sign of prototype: When I ask questions in the forums about what certain cards/rules mean, no one can decide the correct answer. 

I'm selling the game and using the money to buy real strudel.

Update: I hated the iconography, hated the bgg forums, but once you learn it, it's a good game.

I was unsure of this one after my first plays but it has really grown on me. The amount of planning required to get the guests into the hotel rooms is right at the perfect level for me. Plus, it has dice drafting which is one of my favorite mechanisms. I have avoided playing this game with four people but it really shines with two and three.

This is both my kind of game and not. Games with "plan ahead" functions, which this losely have usually suits me. But it's also a game with too few actions, and since I am more of a long term planner the game ends before I get going. 

It is obvious that the worker cards are very strong, and that luck of draw has an inpact on the outcome, and it is also important to play a lot of workers. 

Money is a bottleneck, it's very difficult to come back when you have zero money, and it's also easy to overspend when you do have some money.

After two 4P games and one 2P, I rate as the following:

2P is a 7
4P is a 2 (not "broken" just horrendous)
4P with the AP prone is, like, a negative 6. At least.

For now, am calling it a 6.

Willing to try with 3, but never again with 4. Wayyyy too fucking long with 4P. Wayyy wayyyyyyyyyyy too fucking long!

After reading the rules it does not seem like a very interesting game as you have to simply place guests into rooms to fill up your hotel. But after two plays all of us were quite pleased. The aspect of taking moves based on available dice which effect the quantity you get works very well. Selecting guests, actions and very importantly, staff, all make the game constantly changing as you try to maximize your points. The turn order also adds a nice interaction between players as the one who goes first then goes last.

As others have said, best with 2, ok with 3, and brutally long with 4.  Some have said this game fired Castles of Burgundy.  I disagree.  Grand Austria is a bit rules heavy for what it is.  Castles of Burgundy plays much smoother even accounting for the fiddly set up.  If you are looking for a 2 player game, Grand Austria Hotel is a good choice.  But if you are planning to use it at higher player counts, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

Grand Austria Hotel is a contract fulfillment game where you use dice to draft actions, getting a bonus for the number of dice left in that spot. Turn order is balanced out by taking turns in a "snake draft" order, which seemed pretty balanced, but could provide a little bit of downtime. Both the contract cards and other helper cards had lots of special abilities that allowed players to differentiate strategies quite a bit (though the symbology is pretty arcane and the rules did a poor job of explaining everything). There's a good bit of setup variability too with the goal cards and Emperor reward tiles. I was kind of annoyed by the poor rule book, but I thought the game itself to be pretty engaging and fun.

A game with a total of 14 actions per player during the entire game is going to be pretty tough, and it is. At the same time, building an engine with the different employee-cards and seeing those main actions work out beautifully in your favor is really satisfying. Artwork is great, and the mechanisms work really well together. Why I don't rate it higher is because of the limits the game puts on you, with just being able to choose 2 actions each round. It can be a bit too tough at times, and I've experienced falling behind with no way to claw myself back up. Not entirely the game's fault though, hopefully I'll get better at playing it. Playing it as a 2-player game, and do avoid playing with AP prone players.

Edit: I don't know, after a handful of plays, I am ambivalent to the game. It feels like a really good game, but just doesn't feel "fun" to me. Feels lacking in interesting actions, but really nice combo's can be pulled of. Also worried about replayability, there are lots of cards but the actions etc. seem to play out pretty much the same each game. Maybe just not my cup of tea.

The end of our 1 play fucked up the good feeling I had after 5 rounds.

But even if that wouldn't have happened, this game suffers of severe AP. If an AP-player has the 4/5-tile it takes ages until you can do your move. It's certainly a general feeling you have when you have the 1/8-tile. It easily takes 15 minutes before you can take your second die. An as customers change and dies are taken, there's no point in figuring out your next move until it's actually your turn.

Another creative use of dice in a non-dictatorial manner. The only downside, which is not necessarily a downside but throws a curveball at prioritizing actions, is that it is easy to look at the action that gets the most bang for the buck (in terms of efficient use of dice) as opposed to the one that you need in order to get points.

The game is short - only 7 rounds, and each round each player only gets 2 actions. This fits my preference for games with scarcity - in this case it's scarcity of actions - which makes all of your decisions important.

Of course, in order to get the most of those actions, players need to take advantage of synergies with guests and staff cards. What really jumped out to me from this game is you can start to get these synergies running from the first turn. It's got an engine building aspect, but analogous to a remote start. By the time you get to the car, the engine is already warmed up. That's really satisfying.

The serpentine turn order mechanic can be a bit cumbersome for a 4-player game, but it's not as much of a factor for 3 players and is no burden at all for 2. Then again, that all depends on the amount of AP your fellow players are sporting.

RATING: 9
Whilst the theme of running an early C20th Viennese hotel is, let's say, not ostensibly my favourite (although it is at least unique!), the sheer excellence of the gameplay on offer here renders the theme all but irrelevant. The dice selection mechanism is quite brilliant and integrates wonderfully with the other various parts of the game, from selecting guests, meeting their orders and preparing rooms for them, to hiring staff, managing your funds and seeking to please the Emperor. There's a terrific blend of strategy and tactics. Lacking an overall plan will leave you at a serious disadvantage but you must always be prepared to duck and weave in order to exploit opportunities that arise. It's true that the game falters at a full player count of four due to the way turn order works but at three or especially two, this is a genuine gem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This was a very interesting game. I definitely want to play it again. It is action selection using a collective set of dice that are rolled a the beginning of the round. each round 2 actions are taken by each player in the snake around drafting like catan. This leaves a LOT of downtime if you are start player in the given round. I liked everything the game was doing but it was just too long and too much AP. I am sure that will change with more plays but I had lost interest by the end. I want to play again.

Edit: Played 2p and it really works the best at this count. Would like to own it since it does work so well for 2p.

This is a game about running a hotel. Dice get rolled at the start of each round and players get four chances to remove a die and resolve an action that corresponds to the number, with a strength of action equal to the number of dice that were there before you took one. The game works well enough, but it felt like the flip luck was a little too high in terms of which employee cards you get, and which color of customers are available on your turn. There's also a frustrating turn order mechanism where the turn order sort of snakes. With 2 players, the order goes player 1, 2, 2, 1.  With four, it's 1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1.  This turn order system seems to be different for differences sake because all it really adds is downtime.

Another issue is what you are essentially doing in the game is taking customers, building rooms in colors that match your customers, and then supplying those customers with cubes that match their requirements so they complete the rooms. All this is done with incredibly few actions. The puzzle is ok, but aside from the flipluck issues and the turn order issue, the game lets you take a customer every turn if you have room for one, but the ability to build rooms is dependent on dice being rolled into the right number. This seems like an issue since it can make for a luck driven bottleneck in the game's core mechanism. This is especially annoying since the game punishes you at the end for having unfulfilled customers.

I feel that my opinion of this may get better after multiple plays but my first game was a bit of a let down.
Update: Second play was better than the first. The mechanisms at work in this game are really interesting and I think the design is very clever. However it is let down by the downtime between turns which can seem to last a lifetime. While I like the ideas at work here the game does not seem that fun to play which is disappointing as I really wanted to like it.

Based on my limited experience with the game:
- I definately see, why many think this is a two player game. With four the first player can read a book or something, until it will be his/her turn again.
- AP prone!
- I'm not sure, how much luck plays a role in the game, with the initial card draw, with the dice roll and how the guests are coming out from the deck.
- I really like the game! The theme is unique, and the decisions feel always very difficult. You basically only have 7x2 actions to do whatever you would like to achieve, and you have always to decide, if you would like to be opportunistic or go for the action which you actually need. 
I also very much like the somewhat modular board, where the politics cards & the emperor tiles are different from game to game. It enhances replayability significantly.

A dice drafting game about attracting tourists to your hotel using fancy cakes and wines is as much a recipe for success as you would expect. Okay, so it feels a but like a multiplayer solitair, and those fancy cakes and wines are just cubes you're pushing around, but it feels very satifying snagging the perfect guest to fill that final room of a certain color and achieving that one lofty goal right before end of round scoring. There's plenty of opportunity for meaningful decisions, and I like that this isn't a game about stepping on your neighbors toes. Very relaxing for a medium weight game.

This game has the exact type of puzzle solving I like.  There are several ways to get your points.  You'll never get everything you need in 7 rounds, so you'll need to figure out how to optimize.

I wouldn't recommend playing this with 4 players, unless you want to make dinner between turns.  I like 3 players, but 2 players is definitely best.

A "grand" puzzle to figure out how to make the most of your very limited turns. I really like action selection part of the game with the dice. Getting a more powerful action when there are more dice there and pushing your luck to pass, roll 1 fewer die, and hope for dice to be more in your favor. The money is tight as well, and you can feel very restricted. The emperor track adds another thing you probably shouldn't completely ignore, but at the same time will take away from other things to work on it. Aggh! Fantastic if you like a challenge.

RATING: 6.6
:) Wonderful theme and appealing graphical design

:) Some minor possibilities for engine building and growth while playing

:) Interesting tactical puzzle elements in timing your actions right.

:) Rather original mechanic to take actions (based on dice distribution)

:soblue: There is a pretty high randomness and chaos-factor in this game, not only in the way dice get distributed over available actions, but also in card draws. The combination of both can be very rewarding or punishing to certain stragegies and there is little to nothing you can do in order to change this course of things

:soblue: There is a strange turn order mechanic in this game while playing with 3 or 4 players. It boils down to the fact that in each round certain players can take turns in quick succession, while others may have to wait for (7!) turns before playing again resulting in unaccebable long downtimes. To make things worse: the turns in this game can take a while because there are rather 'puzzley' and due to the chaotic factor of this game, it is impossible to prepare for your turn while others are playing. It also means the game takes way to long with 4 players for the type of game it is

:soblue: The game might suffer from some run-away-leader issues when the cards fall right for one type of strategy and punish another one in the course of the game. The game doesn't really allow you to chose (let alone change) strategy.

:soblue: While I like the theme of this game, the mechanics are not integrated in the theme: this game doesn't give players the feeling that they are really making decisions one running an hotel would make. The mechanics of this game are rather abstract.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
Grand Austria Hotel sure is a charming game with a fun theme and some interesting mechanics. It's a shame that the theme doesn't really shine through in the mechanics. Due to the chaotic and random factor of this game, the game would have benefitted from a shorter game length. With 4 players, the game fails due to downtime issues.

I really don't appreciate games with very elaborate and difficult-to-fathom iconography, in this case made worse by the design of of the staff cards - tiny cursive font in German, resulting in constant consultations of the rulebook for all of us. We did not however experience too much downtime ennui which some complain of. It's another cubes-and-points-salad-cum-economic-engine-type eurogame, unredeemed by any elegance. I also felt (maybe wrongly) that I was too much  at the mercy of the dice as well as the initial hand of staff cards.

It's funny... Many have remarked that there's too much downtime at 4 players due to the snaking turn order, but at the point of writing this, I have already played 3 4-player games with 2 different play groups, and none of the players have had any issues with this. Anyway, it's one of the best dice-drafting games with plenty of replayability due to the objectives (staff, guests and politics cards) and special powers (staff cards) changing every game. Since only 14 dice are drafted throughout the whole game, every decision made is crucial

Currently i´m amazed, how my wife reaches some(!) more employees, politcs cards and reserved rooms as me.

 I bought it to replace Castles of Burgundy. It's more fun and less dry, but Castles of Burgundy is more elegant.
 My main big complaint is that you have to make some strategic decisions at the start of the game, but you have no clue which is going to be the best of them.

Bődületes csalódás.
Minden arra utalt, hogy tetszeni fog ez nekünk. Két személlyel az igazi, kombós, a téma is rendben lenne...
...mindezek ellenére elszomorítóan rossz játékélményt nyújtott. Feleslegesen túlbonyolított, vagy nem is, inkább áttekinthetetlenül sok választási lehetőséget kínáló, lelketlen eurohalmaz.
Ráadásul vontatott, lassú, és nagyon könnyen nagyon be lehet szorulni a látszólagosan sok lehetőség ellenére is. Mindezt tetézte nálam az insert nélküli doboz és rémisztően rajzolt egykaptafa női alakok tömkelege. Illetve a totális ikonkavalkád, ami céljával ellentétben nagyon nem segítette a megértést.
Nem nagyon ülnék le mellé többet.

There's so much cool stuff here. The room groupings giving you stuff based on color! The dice system is well done! The guests add an element of randomness but it's not a total luckfest! And yet....it doesn't quite come together. 

I don't think it's the emperor, which I like for adding tension. Games are over too quickly. It's hard to justify getting a staff member when guests/emperors are usually better options and the politics cards are superfluous. Would benefit from either cutting down emperor penalties to 2 or expanding the rounds to 9. It would also GREATLY benefit from better iconography or summary of what they mean in the rulebook. I want these mechanics in a better game.

Played!! It's super fun. It's the perfect weight for my brain. Middle of the road. Not too crunchy, but more than enough there to sink your teeth into. The game's 7 rounds are over like THAT, at least in a 2 player game. The card-play is very interesting, and the dice...can REALLY mess you over. A lot is going on that you have to manage, and it's just really very cool how it all works together.

All in all. Great middle-weight euro game that really scratches the action-conversion and card-combo itch. Very well done.

This is a great game and one of my favorites of this year's crop. The theme really shines in this one, every action makes perfect thematic sense and you really feel like you're running certain aspects of a hotel. I don't care about theme so much, but it's always nice when excellent gameplay matches the world around it. The diceplay is nice, and the passing mechanism is something that I've never seen before. When you do so, you throw away one die and re-roll the rest, pretty cool. The artwork is beautiful and I appreciate that every single entity displayed on the cards, whether staff or guests, look totally different (no clone syndrome like in other games, COUGH COUGH: Macao!!!) The game plays very smooth and quickly with 2, about an hour on our first game so downtime at that count isn't anymore or less than any other game of it's weight. I look forward to pleasing more guests and being the most efficient Hotelier around these parts.


Top 10 game.

RATING: 6.5
A little disappointed in the game: there are not many ways to achieve victory, the player who's in control of the Emperor's Favor track wins every time. So, you just have two priorities:

a) advancing on the favor track as much as possible
b) control income

boards are completely off balance because some areas are more important to complete than others; the fact that you must pay for almost everything implies that you need to keep an eye on the money and this means that you have to prioritize cash over other things, and this reduces hugely the range of different strategies to victory the game could have delivered otherwise. It'd be enough removing the "pay 1 Kr to serve food to your guests" to improve hugely the game

Also, the pass technique is really of bad quality, and the drag time of the game is huge (after playing a few times 3p we decided to never play it 3p again because if you go 1st, by the time you have to play again you have time to read a chapter in a book)

Not saying it's a bad game, it has a fun theme well pasted on and some very nice little details, but they could have easily delivered a better game, allowing different strategies to victory and with better balanced cards (some of them are grotesquely off-balance)

Hooray! Another great Euro that makes me enjoy dice.

Grand Austria Hotel has such a great elevator pitch: you run a hotel where you prepare rooms for guests. You also have a restaurant where customers come, and you serve them different food items. Seems cutesy and simple and fun.

Yes, very fun. But not simple. This is a hard game to win. Lots of great stuff to think about, whether it is preparing dishes for the patrons, deciding which room for guests to stay, positioning yourself for end-game and mid-game bonuses, etc. The key of the game is to chain actions together, trying to look for combos that work with your strategy. If you don't pay attention, you will find yourself losing very quickly. (I know this from personal experience.)

This is a fun dice drafting game about chaining actions together. You need to balance hiring helpers, moving up on the emperor's favor track, completing goals, preparing rooms, and completing orders for your guests. You will always want to do more than you can, and the game has amazing variability.

The helper cards really should be labeled by number so that they would be easier to reference in the rulebook.

Downtime in 4 player can be a little annoying with slow players, but it's still a great game with 4. It also works well solo using a variant.

The biggest problem with Grand Austria Hotel is the balance of the staff cards, particularly the ones you want to play in the early game. The end game scoring staff cards feel pretty reasonable, with the cards it's easier to score more with costing more. Unfortunately, some of the staff cards that improve action efficiency or give you an income of resources are underpriced, overpriced, or strategically pointless.

This was one of the new ones that I wanted to try at LT18 and I was very pleased.  I enjoyed the theme, the artwork, as well as all of the linked mechanics - staff, customers, etc.  It's got a bit of down time with 4, so I'd probably prefer to play this with only 3, but it was still a lot of fun.

With 2, this is an absolute, hands-down 10.  I'll play it any time and it will never leave my collection.

Finally got to play it with 3p and while the pace is obviously a little bit slower, it wasn't unbearably slower.  An excellent addition to the dice-for-actions genre.

Yipes, the downtime for the 4P game is rough due to the turn order system. I'm not keen on waiting 10 to 15 minutes for my turn in a middle-weight game. The not-quite-intuitive iconography doesn't do any favours either. 

Beyond that however, is a fairly clever balancing act. The concept of drafting dice for actions, and making each action dependent on the number of dice in the pool strikes an ideal balance of luck and strategy. The thematic flair is also surprisingly strong for a Euro, and you do feel like a harried manager trying to satisfy guests. There are a few gamey elements, like the politics tiles and emperor track, but the overall thematic feel is there.

This pushes a lot of right buttons for me and contains the right amount of innovation. But I'll probably only take on 3P games from now on.

Classic Euro-style game of gathering cubes, collecting special abilities, converting resources and scoring points in various ways.  The theme could be about anything, but it works for this game, but doesn't make it any more exciting.  All of the mechanisms work together, but the game gets slower with each round as players collect more and more special abilities.  Turns become a slow churn while players try to manipulate and optimize resulting in a game that last far longer than I would like.

Célunk hotelünkbe betérő vendégek étellel, itallal ellátása, majd egyik megfelelő szobánkba elszállásolása. A játék akcióválasztó mechanizmusa az Yspahan kockaválasztásán alapul, annyi különbséggel, hogy egy játékos amikor kockát választ nem teszi elérhetetlenné a többiek számára az adott akciót a későbbiekben csak csökkenti az erejüket. A játékban van három nyílt bónuszt adó cél is, van kegysáv, amit a 7 körös játékban 3-szor pontozunk és büntetés is jár, ha nem haladtunk rajta eleget. A játék tipikus euró, sok úttal. Hátránya az AP veszély, így valószínűleg ketten lehet a legjobb. Négyen már nagyon hosszúra nyúlhat. Hibája még a rengeteg ikon és főleg az, hogy ezek nem mindegyike van elmagyarázva rendesen a szabályban. Újat nem mutat, de jól működik.

I was quite surprised with Grand Austria Hotel. Initially it looked interesting, but after my first play, I thought it was too difficult to do well. But like with most designs from this group of Italians, repeated plays and experience is rewarded. Eventually the combination of dice drafting and card play became easier to understand and now the game is one of my favorites. It does have a considerable amount of fiddliness, but overall I think the design is quite streamlined. The iconography is sometimes cumbersome to deal with, but the rule book does a decent job of explaining things. I'm not a fan of the tiny cursive font used on the staff cards as it makes looking up their abilities even more difficult. If you enjoy a mid-weight Euro with a quirky theme (feeding hotel guests and then sending them to a prepared room), I definitely recommend this one.

I'm not quite sure how to label this game. It's a dice placementish game with some modest engine building (with your hotel staff) and reasonable amount of theme. The theme comes through strongest in the look of the game, the drawings of the guests, the feel of an old-world Austrian hotel. The game is pure Euro in its play. There is some modest player interaction only in the sense of "hmmm, maybe I should play that die because he's going to want it." I've heard this is better 2 (the only way I've played it so far) and I could see the chaos factor upping too much with 4 players.

I like it. It's not brilliant, nothing blows me away, but it's a pleasant little puzzle of game that doesn't overstay its welcome.

RATING: 7
UPside- cool theme, card combos, engine building, bonus actions, many scoring opportunities, variable scoring objectives/bonuses from game to game.

DOWNside- dice rolling and card draws have potential to cause 'windfall' effects leading to large gaps in final scores; some turn sequences can take awhile to resolve resulting in significant downtime for players; theme not fully realized due to boring/confusing cube illustrations on cards instead of food icons.

“Hotel rooms are a naturally creepy place.”

You want a point salad? Because this is how you get a point salad! And in the best way possible.
The variability of the setup makes so that you will never play 2 games that are perfectly equal and the mechanics work wonderfully. Perfectly executed dice drafting game.
If i had to find something negative it would be both the production, which has some minor problems and the fact that in 4p, with AP prone people, 1st player will wait a lot.

After 1 play - It's a really interesting design. I loved the dice mechanic and how the # of dice directly affects the power of the action. The prestige (?) track is absolutely brutal but awesome. Another really great mechanic. Where I think the game suffers is from the randomness of the Staff cards and the downtime. For the Staff cards, and sorry ahead for whining about this, I got absolutely hosed. Full stop. There is a recommended intro deal where everyone gets the same type of cards and another recommended advanced draft deal where you select a staff card and pass to the left. The straight up random deal seriously skews the playing field. I may not have had the most optimal play but when the winners final score is 4x my score, that signals an issue. Anyhoo, I also thought the downtime was way too long but that could diminish over time. Overall, would love to give it another whirl.

Excellent game. It's an action-selection dice roller. What sets this apart is that it's really well done, and the theme is really nicely integrated. The dice mechanics are great: the power of a given action diminishes after you take it, and you can pass to take your chances by re-rolling all of the dice (well, with one fewer die available), but getting first crack at them. Then you have long-term objectives, trying to balance opening up rooms, getting food and serving the right guests, and bonus actions after satisfying certain guests. Very thinky.

This is another of those games using dice in a clever new way. At the start of each round, a pile of d6 are rolled and sorted by number to their action spaces. Players take 2 turns, switchback style. On your turn, take a die and that action -- the more dice there, the better your action. The actions allow you to prepare rooms on your personal board, hire staff (who give you different powers), get food/drinks (cubes), take customers from the display, etc. There's a weird pass mechanism where you skip your turn for now; you'll take it later, along with a reroll -- but with fewer total dice. You're trying to run a hotel and cafe, attracting customers to feed and house (after getting the food/drinks and rooms ready, of course). Your staff allows you to do stuff better. And there's some other stuff to do, too. The game ends after 7 rounds (only 14 total actions!); most VP wins.

I had fun with this although downtime was approaching being an issue (especially when you're first in the round ... and last). The game might be best with 2, or maybe 3 with more experience? I would like to try this again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think this is a fantastic...2-player...game.  I am so glad to see that the BGG consensus is that the game should be played with 2-3 and is best with 2.  This is a game of competing hoteliers.  Each round dice are rolled, the number on a die corresponds to an action, the more dice associated with that action for the round, the more powerful that action is.  You then select an action and remove a die, making that action weaker.  Each player gets two actions each round.  The actions are making food and drink, opening hotel rooms to accommodate guests, making money, and hiring staff.  Each round you can also attract a customer to your hotel who will order a specific combination of food and drink.  When you complete their order you get a bonus ability and they occupy a room.

My favorite part of this game is the engine building.  Staff and guests each provide special abilities and there is a lot to juggle.  Food and drink, money, open rooms (opening which takes money), and even a special "emperor track" that you want to be at specific points at during three different rounds and will grant you an extra benefit or penalize you.  You can combo a lot of these staff and guest abilities and that is what makes this at best a 2-player game in my opinion.  Turns can get long as you chain a bunch of different abilities and effects off of one action.  And there is nothing for you to really do when it isn't your turn, there isn't any player interaction past taking guests and actions your opponents may want.  The turns also snake which means the last player in turn gets to go first for the second set of actions.  So you can end up waiting a long time to do something in a four player game.

But the variety, variability, and solid system interaction make it a great duel experience.

I loved the dice drafting element and the hotel/cafe theme worked really well with the mechanics of the game. I also liked that everyone had different workers to hire. The variety of round bonus/penalties and also end game bonus will also for great replayability. It is a bit AP prone. I'm not sure how I feel about the player order (1-2-3-4-4-3-2-1) as it can be a long time between turns. Despite this negative, I still thought it was an excellent game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Overall a good game. The turn order mechanism is clever but it has its disadvantages. Down time may be too much (played a 4 player game).
Minor goals during play are fun as they elect a particular path for each player and the dice work well. I would prefer to have a rule allowing the move of dice from column to column by paying money, as this would mitigate luck or lack of it, but the design decision of not having it is acceptable as well.
Could be more interactive and sometimes it gets frustrating when you don't have the needed guest color for your hotel room. Even when you try to play safe and prepare one room of each color, sometimes it's not enough as you might need a particular color to take some VP bonuses.

Reasons I like this game: 
-Card combos can be fun if they work; see below.
-Pretty good balance of tactics and strategy.
-Highly variable scoring conditions increases replay value.
-The turn order tokens make choosing a starting player so easy.

Reasons I hate this game: 
-The poorly written/translated rulebook.
-Money is way too tight/ no way to generate income independent of randomly appearing guests cards, random dice rolls of '4', and filling red rooms with guests.
-Resources are way too tight/ no way to exchange resources.
-I feel like I'm playing against the game more than my opponents.
-The lack of any player interaction makes a comeback highly improbable.
-Turn order really matters when drafting dice.
-Many of the important factors in the game are highly luck dependant, which is unacceptable for a game of this weight/length.

TL;DR: The game is kinda fun when things go your way; however this is not the case the majority of the time. The game is unforgiving and you can be randomly screwed. There are many games at the same weight/length better than this.

I really liked my first play of this game.  The way the mechanics combo together is satisfying and fun.  Dice drafting is an interesting mechanic.

This game has a really cool concept but it's a tragedy that the dice can influence it so much.

UPDATE: After playing this half a dozen times I'm dropping my rating as the staff cards are just too swingy. Even if you draft them at the start of the game, a player can pull more staff cards during the game that seal it up. I think the game would even work *without* staff cards.

A resource management game with more tactical decisions than strategic. It's fun to play and try to fill your hotel more efficiently and faster than your opponents.

Key to success is to balance your resources, meaning carefully choosing your guests, and make sure that you do not run out of money when its time to build the more expensive rooms or you lose tempo and will fall behind.

Best with three players

A welcome diversion from the currently all-to-present worker placement games. Grand Austria Hotel, however, provides a similar feel like other heavy Eurogames. Resources (especially money) are scarce and you really have to plan ahead to avoid catastrophe. The random victory tiles (and emperor's favors) that are drawn before each game provide a very strong variability (like the gods' favors in the Tzolk'in expansion).

The game mechanics for the most part are very well thought out and mesh well.  You get clients to come to your café, get fed, and then crash in a room.  The hotel servants can come in and help you do this more effinetly.  I have three major hits on the game.  The way the turns move through the players ....a go around the board one way only to reverse then come back around the board another way then the turn reverses a third time and goes back around the first way.  After the turn ends then you rotate the start player can me a lot of down time for a player in certain circumstances.  The game itself leads to lots of Analysis Paralysis and the iconography increases the downtown.   We had to repeatedly go back over and again and search the rule book to figure out what certain icons meant.  The servants powers are only listed by name and the name on the card is written in a Italized cursive script at less than 6poiny.  Again I bitch about publishers using a font that is to small for these eyes.  One icon we could not figure out and threw out of the game.  20 percent of the time was spent trying to figure out what the cards did.  Writing the text of what the characters did while having icons  would have sped up the process greatly.  Now to be honest I was play with two AP players.  However there is no way you can preplan a turn because the board changes to much before your turn.

One of an increasing number of really good euros that use theme very effectively to create a fun and rewarding experience. The game doesn't take too long to play as a 3, being only 7 rounds with 2 turns each per round, and this helps to ensure the game never outstays its welcome.

A really nice design and what a fun game. I just don't understand why they used such incredibly tiny font to identify the cards? As Paul Grogan points out in his review, the cards should have been numbered - this would have made it much easier to look them up.

Watch out for long intervals between some player turns. I think this is one of those rare games that actually plays better with fewer players (3 is probably best).

It is a great game. If Burgundy is your game you will like this game 2. We are a 2 player household and this is a great 2 player game. 
The names on the staff members you can hire for your hotel are printed very small on the cards, we assume in the next edition they will print the names bigger.
After now +40 games - at the moment our favorite game, the following staff members are to powerful to posess in the 1st or 2nd round: Bote, Kuechenhilfe, Dekorateur.
We are also playing with a slight modification 
a) in the beginning you can choose what you do with you 10 money, either i.e. 7 money and 3 statue points
b) we only hand out 3 staff members (keep 2 and hand the last one to your opponent)
c) we shuffle all A / B / C cards and use 3 (could i.e. be all of A) for the 3 spots - the same with the round (3/5/7) cards
It is just a great game

It was really good.  I enjoyed playing it.  Dice 'drafting' was different and a solid addition.  It might have a bit too much luck involved with a. dice, b. the random customers c. random starting powers d. random helpers.  However, this 'luck' is different than a game that is 100% dice rolling.

Biggest thing for me was that it was short.  I wanted to be able to do more things, and wanted to fill more of my board.  The 7 rounds that were played just wasn't enough.  Number of components and the size of my personal board really led me to believe that I would be able to do more than I was actually capable of.

Game requires a good amount of planning and it pretty deep.  Maybe subsequent play throughs will provide me with a better understanding of everything and how to squeeze everything I wanna do in just 7 rounds.  

Also slogs with more players.  Time between turns could end up being close to 15-20 minutes.

tl;dr: good but too luck dependent

I wanted to like this game. Except that I was frustrating for two thirds of the time. There is so much good stuff going on, but that seemed to be thwarted by unlucky die rolls. So, if you really need a certain thing to move on to your next step, and that is not rolled (or in low amount and you just happend to be in last place) and there are no sixes, you're out of luck. You can do some other stuff in the hopes that will give you some points, but there isn't really anything you can do to sacrifice something to perform the action you need most. And that bothered me, and the other players.
The next problem was that there was some AP going on, mostly caused by the bad die rolls, which led to a playing time of about 150 minutes, which was too much for this game.
Other than that, we all thought there was a good game hidden in there, it just didn't come out. Maybe this was a fluke, maybe this game needed a bit more development.

[i]Really good[/i] multi-player solitaire Euro cube pusher that puts you in a straightjacket.

The real surprise is it's a Euro with a theme that (mostly) fits together. 

I think the complaints about downtime are a little overstated. There's enough to think about here that getting turns 1 & 8 isn't that big of a deal unless you're playing with three other people who are really AP prone.

It does sing at 2p, and reminds me that multiplayer solitaire games can, in fact, be excellent. My favorite game of its type.

Played this at Billabongs, and I immediately knew that this was a must-have. The whole theme fits so well with the game mechanics, from trying to attract clients to your hotel, to serving out food to them, to the bonus actions/resources that fulfilling client requests give you. This game has me planning things like "if I fulfill this, I can get that to help me grab this which further fulfills this.. what was I trying to do again?"

After just a single play I was impressed. The game presents an interesting puzzle to solve without overcomplicating the decision space. Generating resources to satisfy guests is just one aspect. You'll also need to time things correctly to make sure you have enough money and prepared rooms to ensure you can keep the entire circus rolling. Where the game really shines is in two areas: (1) the race to satisfy three different variable point scoring conditions and (2) the bonus/penalty track. Each places enough pressure on you to ensure you'll feel like you never have enough time to do everything you want.

What I worry about: Is this just a puzzle in need of solving? Is there an optimum strategy? In other words, where is the player interaction? It's certainly in the race, but I'm not sure it's in much more than that. Reading what other players need and trying to claim their guests/resources before they do is one aspect that ties everyone together, but I'm not sure how strong an incentive that really is. Only repeat plays will tell.

Some interesting mechanics, but it's slower than it should be. Also has great potential for rich-get-richer problems, as guests come with bonuses so those who are doing well tend to pull away with no opportunity for others to come back. Also extremely rough on the third or fourth player for the same reason ... they're going to get off of a slower start and likely will trail from wire to wire. It's also critical to let new players know a) that their game will suffer badly if they run short on money, and b) all the ways they can get money, including finishing groups of red rooms. Having an extra dollar each turn to use as a wild die is critical to succeeding in this game, so being flush with cash is a must. Overall, this is something of a rough gem - it could have used some polishing, but there's some good stuff at the core here. UPDATE: Grand Austria Hotel remains an interesting game that I'll get to the table now and again, but because of both balance issues and downtime, I will never tackle this with four players again.

Pretty solid die drafting Euro.  It didn't knock my socks off mechanically or introduce anything super unique but it plays very smooth.

There's a couple guests who have somewhat unnecessarily confusing reward (E.Gizia comes to mind) that likely could have been done as a promo or something just to further smooth out the rules.

But other than that it's an interesting, very tight design that can allow for some exciting moves throughout the game.

RATING: 7
Grand Austria Hotel is a dice drafting game about running a hotel. You pay money to attract guests to your cafe (as hotels do) but they'll only take a room in your hotel if you can fill their order (just like real life). Your cafe is small and can only hold 3 guests, who stick around until you fill their order, no matter how long it takes (as customers are wont to do). This presents a bit of a challenge for you because serving strudel, cake, wine and coffee is difficult for you and it's hard to come by cake and coffee for game-y unthematic reasons. But once you fill their order, guests won't stay in just any room... yellow guests will only stay in yellow rooms, red in red, blue in blue. So you'd better prepare the right rooms ahead of time. But then there are also tourists who have no discrimination and will stay anywhere.

When guests take a room, you get victory points and usually some bonus. There's also bonuses for filling particular blocks of rooms. And at game end, rooms on higher floors score more points (which offsets their higher preparation costs). There's also staff you can hire that give you all sorts of bonuses, ongoing powers, or end-of-game points.

And kind of just thrown in for no apparent reason is an emperor's favor track, which you have to advance on to get bonuses... and if you fail to advance far enough there will be penalties. And every time that track is scored, you'll slide back down it a ways.

The dice drafting is a little interesting. You roll the dice and assign them to one of six actions by the number of pips. Then players take turns choosing a die. You get to do the associated action one time for every die that was there when you picked it. You can spend a buck to do it an extra time... but money is awfully tight in this game. Every player gets two dice a round (in a seven round game) but the order goes player 1 --> player 2 --> player 3 --> player 3 --> player 2 --> player 1 (in a 3 player game). If the dice hate you, you can pass. Then after everyone has either taken two dice or passed, you trash a die and reroll them. You can keep doing this as long as you like, but eventually you'll run out of dice.

So yeah... the theme is a bit contrived on this one. And I already know that several people in my groups will view it as just another optimization euro where nothing particularly has any purpose than to give points at every turn. But that's the kind of game I really like... where you have to peer into a forest of options and pick a path. I love games where the choices aren't obvious and you have to try to find the best way among a myriad of options. I love trying to juggle all those possibilities and coming out ahead. Unfortunately, that's not the type of game that garners much excitement around these parts.

RATING: 2.5
Mechanically, this is a more complicated version of Yspahan with a bunch of extra stuff tacked on. The theme works fairly well, with the basic idea being to acquire goods to complete quests (food to satisfy guests). However, only 2-3 of the six actions provide you with food, and two types are forced to be more rare than the other two. The remaining actions are required to set up rooms for the guests (you can't complete the quests and get the guests out of your dining room otherwise) or play staff cards that give you bonus abilities or points, or claim cash or the Emperor's favour. 

These other actions, however - especially the last two - are 'extra' mechanics tacked on to the base, that require you to divert your attention from the main goal of meeting guests' requirements. In a worker placement game, limited action spaces would prevent you from easily completing tasks - in this game, it's the extra work that's required that does so. For example, if you fail to acquire sufficient Emperor points, you suffer significant penalties three times during the game, which is... irritating. 

Worse, however, are the staff cards; you start with a handful at the beginning of the game and it's very difficult to get more. Many of them work with each other to build up self-reinforcing combos, but if you don't draw those at the start of the game, you're forced to divert even more resources from the main task in order to try and acquire additional staff. In other words, if luck is against you, either in the draw or in the choice of guests, you'll fail to acquire those combos and you can see the writing on the wall by mid-game. In a way, the staff cards add a bit of an engine-building mechanic to the base game by presenting you with 116 different ways to modify it. This also gives it a bit of an Agricola feel.

While it's not my favourite game, I do like Yspahan. However, I'm terrible at engine-builders (about the only one I like is Spyrium, even though I suck at it) and I've developed quite a hate for games that introduce variability by throwing dozens of cards at you that modify the base rules in different ways, each with its own tiny text or icons that you need to keep track of. GAH does both of these things. 

I see how the pieces of this game are supposed to fit together, and I know that people will like it for what it is. I do not, mainly because it contains several elements I personally find unenjoyable in general - many different cards with unique text/icons that modify the rules in different ways, engine-building (or something that resembles it in practice), and 'luck of the draw' that has a significant impact on your position from the start of the game. The down time between your turns can also be considerable - 5 minutes or more in a 4-player game. 

I acknowledge that this game is well thought out and well put together, and that it does work. If you enjoy games with limited resources, difficult choices, careful planning, and lots to do with not enough time in which to do it, you may very well enjoy this game. My rating is solely a reflection of my personal bias against most of these factors.

First few plays: Hard to fully evaluate; my main playing partner (the spousal unit) has taken a bit of a dislike to it because I keep beating her, and she feels she can't control it. She is willing to keep trying, though, so we'll see. I was hoping for something of the depth and addictiveness of Tzolkin, but it's less meaty than that. Sort of feels cobbled together with duct tape.

After a few more plays, we've gone to her initial impression rather than mine. Kind of a weird game, doesn't hang together. Luck-driven to the point of a problem and nowhere near as fun for us as Viticulture, which is a similar weight and similarly luck-driven game. 

The dice action selection is definitely cool, though, I like that mechanic a lot.

Reviewed after ~15 plays

Pros: 
+Great dice mechanic.  
+Enjoyable, unique theme
+Definitely see similarities to CoB, yet the game retains its own unique identity.  Wouldn't say it replaces CoB as I've heard, they both deserve their own spot.  I think this game makes the greater initial impact on me (and those I've shared it with) but CoB has a bit better lasting power.

Cons:
-I enjoy games that involve some level of luck, but I feel this one pushes it just a little too far.  The right/wrong staff cards or right/wrong guests can make it or break it.  There's definitely luck mitigation, but it's just often not enough
-The game gets tired after numerous plays.  With only five unique player boards, the game starts to feel very repetitive.  Certainly the staff/guests you get each game vary, but even those feel limited and you will see many of them pop up over and over again.

Agricola, you used to be my favourite game until I met Grand Austria Hotel... and it was love at first sight. With Gloomhaven joining our love triangle, I might as well start keeping a harem soon...
Anyway, Grand Austria Hotel is the best 2 player game I have ever played (never played at higher player counts but probably never will due to down-time issues). Jenny and I can play this in less than an hour as the first few rounds just go by so fast and only really slowing down with AP in the last one or two rounds. But then, of course, we have played this a few times by now. Here is what I learnt the hard way: never rely on lucky dice rolls! The game rewards an opportunistic playing style; keep your options open and do not focus too hard on one goal. Oh, one more thing, there are so many variables in the base game alone that I can imagine myself playing GAH till the end of times, not even wanting an expansion. On the other hand, I seriously can’t even think what an expansion could add to this perfect design, apart from maybe more guest and staff cards...

Loved the mechanics of my first play even though we got a fairly critical rule wrong that tanked my game.  

My only complaint so far is the emperor track being very strict.  I'll need to play with that In mind to see if it's manageable or so strict it annoys me.

Update: 1 more play, still love it. Lost horribly but at least I was dominating on the emperor track. My downfall was drafting too strongly into that track and ignoring the objective cards. Solid game but the downtime between selecting dice will keep it from being a 10.

A cute eurogame with dice drafting. Good flow, well-constructed and works well with two (although going 1st and 4th can be frustrating). The theme is reasonably strong with this one, with few thematic problems, and the component quality is excellent. In short, an appealing medium-weight euro.

Player interaction is limited to taking one dice before another player (has less effect than you'd imagine), or taking cards before them. Moreover, the dice drafting mechanism felt less innovative than I'd expected, and is uninteresting compared to other euros like Troyes.

The icons take some work to learn and the game is remarkably fiddly compared to Castles of Burgundy - a favourite euro. Hasn't replaced it at all and can't compete with our stronger euros. For sale after one play.

RATING: 5
Just yet another resource conversion Euro rehashing mechanisms from other games.

Extremely annoying, pointless Emperor track which constantly interrupts the actual game - like a boss constantly poking you and demanding three-hour long status meetings every morning and afternoon to analyse why you have not finished your work, yet.

Also effectively broken player boards as one player happened to have completely overlapping goals scoring double for achieving a single goal (and if he had happened to start with one of my initial staff cards he could effectively have scored triple).

Great theme and tight game with limited actions. Still one of my favorite dice drafting games. Good replayability. Managed to pick up a copy at Origins flea market for $40. 

Edit: favorite at 2, OK at 3 but pushing it re: downtime. Won't play at 4.

# 4 joueurs : pas essayé mais je doute que cette(ces) configuration(s) soi(en)t vraiment intéressante(s) du à l’ordre des tours de jeu en aller-retour (1-2-3-4-4-3-2-1) qui fait que le joueur 1 est celui qui attend le plus longtemps entre les 2 actions de son tour de jeu. À noter qu’une variante officielle a été postée sur BGG à ce sujet.

►COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
+ THÈME : assez présent; relativement bien intégré.
+ Aide de jeu (« Actions additionnelles ») : 1 par joueur. Bien détaillé.
- Aide de jeu (cartes « Personnel ») : non-inclus, j’aurais aimé qu’il y en ait au moins 1 (photocopies?).
+ Configurations équilibrées selon le nombre de joueurs.
+ Configurations multiples : plateaux individuels personnalisés.
± Icônes : sont relativement aisées à apprendre et à mémoriser.
- Matériel : non-optimal; certaines icônes ne sont pas intuitives et nécessitent de se référer au livret des règles (parfois à plusieurs reprises si difficulté à les mémoriser).
- Matériel : écriture; les titres des cartes « Personnel » en très petits caractères et d’une police difficile à lire.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
Jeu de gestion où chaque joueur incarne un hôtelier qui doit nourrir ses clients, avant de pouvoir leur louer des chambres, et embaucher du personnel afin de prospérer.

Thématiquement immersif sauf en ce qui concerne la « Piste de l’Empereur », qui selon moi aurait mieux convenu à un "inspecteur en hôtellerie", quoique c’est un détail qui ne gêne pas le jeu. 

À noter que certains de mes joueurs lui reprochent le côté trop aléatoire de ses pioches « Client » et « Personnel », surtout en ce qui concerne les cartes « Personnel » qui peuvent générer des combos très forts. En cela, les règles suggèrent d’utiliser les mains de départ pré-définies ou la variante de draft pour "experts". 

►JEU(X) COMPARABLE(S) ESSAYÉ(S):
< « Château Lafortune (aka Full house) » (1979) : roll-and-move familial sur un thème hôtelier avec hébergement de clients. Pour les nostalgiques de CL, je trouve que GAH en représente la meilleure "évolution" (considérant que GAH est plus complexe dans ses règles et mécaniques).

This game was better than I expected.  It's fairly easy to learn as there are only five actions in the game but the decisions about the order of actions plus goals for the end of certain rounds makes for interesting decision making. I would not play this more than 2 players because the downtime is pretty big because of the snake rounds.  Super fun game that taxes your ability to plan your moves efficiently.

This is great game, has elicited many mixed feelings from game to game but think I've settled on it being great. Can understand what people mean with the similarity to Castles of Burgundy but find this one more fulfilling (though that comes at the cost of increased playtime and complexity). I also see why many are reluctant to play more than 3. Mostly enjoying this as a 2p.

Serving customers in the hotel. Actions are selected by picking dice from common pool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nothing groundbreaking here, just a typical 'harvest resources to meet randomly generated demands' type game. Meeting those demands is usually a three or four action process, but like any good Euro the game is in efficiency and exploiting card combos to get two or three for one action swaps. It does this very well and the unpredictability of the dice pool which dictates action selection creates a very interesting puzzle every turn. As if that weren't enough, the game allows you to pass your turn in exchange for re-rolling the action dice. The catch, is that the dice pool shrinks by one every time you do so...effectively adding a push-your-luck aspect on top of everything else.

Again, absolutely nothing groundbreaking but a very enjoyable experience nonetheless.

RATING: 5.5
When it works, it works well, but ultimately everything is determined by random card availability and random dice-rolls for action availability so while the big combos are satisfying, you realise you're severely punished when they're simply not available, and it can simply come down to random factor upon random factor. It's mildly entertaining and once in a while exciting but for something that isn't whip-cracking clever, it takes far too long, even with two players. For those who like to go slow and simply make the best of available opportunities. I used to be able to do that in years past but not any more, or at least not with such little agency and for so damn long.

Heavily thematic euro! Once in a while the dice just hate on everyone, but at least it tends to hit everyone at once. Suffers from downtime at higher player counts but I very much like it at 2, and really, that theme is so strong.

RATING: 8
I really like the dice drafting mechanism in this one, it's very cleaverly designed. The variable long-term goals as well as huge decks of assitants and guests guaratnee high replayability -  they will force you to pick a slightly different strategy each time you play. It's not a groundbreaking euro, but it's very enjoyable. I don't think I would play it with more than 2 players though, the downtime would be unbearable.

Too complicated and convoluted for my tastes.
Too many irons in the fire.
The difficult decisions come out more of shear chaos than real interest. The personnel cards seem very different in their strenght and at the first game you need to assess the value of six of them. things seem, all in all, quite unrelated.
The game itself works flawlessly but it's almost a multiplayer solitaire with a lot of downtime due to the unreasonable amount of choices and chaos.

RATING: 8.5
Lots of re-playability b/c of the varying bonuses and targets, and a unique theme.  The scores swing between players during the game, but by the time you do the Emperor Scoring (3rd, 5th and 7th rounds) they tighten up quite a bit.  Multiple paths to victory and some "do this before that" type decision making.  Overall, deep "long game" strategy and thematic, which allows for for a satisfying conclusion.

Hospitality entrepreneurs compete to grow their strudel cafe's into a grand Austrian hotel.  Dice action draft and a myriad of area control, set collection, and pattern matching scoring objectives. Get patrons cards from central tableau, match their food order cube needs, and get them a matching color room on a higher level floor, hire helpers for action and prestige engine combos. The heart of the game is the dice pool draft system similar to La Granja. The distribution of dice values leads to very engaging decisions between picking the rare actions versus picking the common actions that provide a "quantity discount". A lot to mind grind between the right dice action, the right patron with the right cube needs, to the right room, with the right helper to match the right pattern...Booom! Sorry head exploded. Blase' theme in a huge point salad with a fun dice auction. Turns can take a little while to figure out which can be a little wait before your next turn.

For me the game provides a lot of theme and the dice drafting mechanic is so fun.  It might be my favorite mechanic and I'm finding myself in search of other dice drafting games.  

Update 3/18/17:  Starting to have second thoughts about this game.  Several games in a row I have had poor scoring games because of the dice rolls but my opponent was able to be successful due to the staff members he had out or used.

I knew I was a fan of Simone Luciani because I thought The Voyages of Marco Polo was an absolutely phenomenal game. I had high hopes for Grand Austria Hotel because it combined dice drafting (which was done very well in Marco Polo) with a theme I very excited about. Well, it did not disappoint. I like it even MORE than Marco Polo. The game feels to me like a fine balancing act where you're juggling several different things while always keeping an eye on the horizon - and I like that challenge. I also think the snake draft adds an interesting twist to dice drafting (though makes me know I won't ever want to play this with 4, or possibly even 3 players). On top of that two of the resources are coffee and cake (two of my favorite things)?! I adore this game and I can't wait to get my hands on Luciani's latest innovative dice Euro (Lorenzo il Magnifico).

This game has quickly ascended to the upper tier of both my and my wife's favorite games.  The art is spectacular, the theme shows throughout the game, and gameplay is just lots of fun.  This manages to pull off that feeling I've only ever found in Agricola, where you always feel like you need just 1 more turn in order to do what you set out to do.  Sometimes, you get lucky and chain things together, other times, you realize you haven't paid enough attention to your dwindling cash flow and have paralyzed yourself. It's a great game.

Grand Austria Hotel is right up my alley. While I think that some will feel like it's a "multiplayer-solitaire" game (which I don't mind), you do have to keep tabs on what other people are doing because you're competing for the same stuff (end game bonus points, dice-actions, guests, etc). Yes, you are somewhat constrained by the dice in the type and number of actions that you can take on your turn, but I believe that there are ways to mitigate that through clever card-play and/or passing and taking your chances at re-rolling the dice. Being able to be focused yet having the flexibility to take an opportunistic strike is key as well. And, you really need to be able to play off of your cards and min/max every turn. While that may sound off-putting to some and very dry, I do think that the theme of the game comes through. Many euro's have a pasted on theme and the mechanics don't seem to match the game play. I think that Grand Austria Hotel's theme works very well and is apparent throughout.

The main criticism that I've read/heard about the game is the snaking turn order. While I don't think that I'd actively try to play with 4, I never felt like I was sitting and waiting for something to do on my turn with just the three of us. And, even when I was going 1st and 6th, there was so much to take in and try to figure out that I didn't mind the time to plan my next move. Also, you're "generally" only going to go 1st and 6th (in a 3 player game) twice... so it's really not that bad. I personally found the times that I had to go back-to-back (3rd and 4th in turn order) more stressful.

Also, while not a concern for me, the "emperor scoring" phases can be pretty punishing and might be a turn-off to some. It's a game with many options and you're not going to be able to fulfill them all. You really do need to determine whether or not something is worth it at the expense of losing something else. If you spread yourself too thin, you're not going to do that well at all.

The variability of the setup lends itself to endless plays and strategies and is something that I was immediately interested in exploring more. Because of how I felt right after the game, I knew that it left me with a good impression as I was left thinking about what I could have done better and what turn(s) led to my downfall. All-in-all, I was very interested in playing the game again soon... and this time with a proper draft of the staff cards.

One of the best 2 player heavy games I´ve played, maybe an excelent 3 player once everybody knows the game well, need to play this one more.

EDIT (JUL 17) downgrade this game from 9 to 7.5, this game doesnt work with 3 players the overturn kill it (3 hours), still a very good game for 2, although expensive.

The font used on staff cards is really hard to read.

The rulebook led to some questions and a few errors but it is a good game and I look forward to playing it again now we have initial learning hiccups out of the way.

After 4 plays I feel like I know the game reasonably well and have ironed out the rules. 

The game goes from strength to strength I really enjoy the freedom offered by the additional actions which create space to be creative in how you solve puzzles. I'm really enjoying it.

The dice mechanism is somewhat Yspahan-like, everything else: the resources, cards, set-collection and tableau-building are a very fine puzzle to work out... the better you piece together your own strategy puzzle, the more points you will score... great game and the long turns do exist, but don't bother me...

I played a 2 people game and enjoyed every moment of it. The art and components is ok, as you used to have in these games. However,  Being an euro game, GAH is in fact a pretty handsome game. The rules are so simple that you don't feel the depth, complexity that the game might have. Maybe I am feeling it a little shallow. I love get/exchange resources part. The emperor track doesn't have too much sense for me, the abilities of the guest and employers neither. But in general the game makes sense as a whole, it doesn`t feel broken and it is really easy to teach and learn. The bad thing is that the icons are not intuitive, you have to check the manual all the time.

Tetszik, meggyőző volt az első játék, bár közöm nem volt a történésekhez, ráadásul egy szabályt is csúnyán benéztem tanulás közben. Sebaj, jöhet a következő alkalom, ez a fajta kockamenedzselés már a Marco Polóban is tetszett. Egyébként annyira nem hasonlítanak (itt közös készlet van, ott külön mindenkinek), félreértés ne legyen, bőven megfér egymás mellett a két játék.

A 2. játékra minden letisztult és sikerült már jó kombókat is összehozni, ez pedig tisztességes pontszámot eredményezett a végén. Egyre jobban tetszik, helye van minden eurós gyűjteményében.

A 4 fős kipróbálás után azt kell, hogy mondjam, ez sajnos sokat veszít így az értékéből. Egyértelműen szenvedés úgy, nagyon megnő a holtidő, egyáltalán nem ajánlom ennyi játékossal.

Surprisingly, considering that I think Marco Polo is the best euro game available at the moment, I didn't like this game.

Traded away after 2 plays.

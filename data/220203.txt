I think the most disappointing thing about this game is the lack of kitties in it, all the animals are other species, which is extraneous but confusing. This is more of an activity than a game, I'd kill 15 mins with it but fine never playing it again

Light deduction game with a bit of a race element. Fun and non-taxing. Gives me sudoku vibes.

A fun game of deduction! I consider it a bit more of a filler game, which is fine by me.

RATING: 7
Interesting logic/deduction game.  Don't know if it really plays well with only 2 players - very hard to keep track of all the cards that have already been played in previous rounds to use card counting to your advantage.  More players would put more cards in play during the round.

RATING: 7
Fairly quick and relatively interesting deduction game whereby each turn you play 2 cards which are either leads or dead ends on deducting what your investigation card is. 

It has a sort of Hanabi feel to it but you are deducing a single card which makes it feel simpler and more friendly. 

Overall it was an interesting if simple, Furriarty almost got away, so there was some adding tension.

2017-06-30 - This is a really good, light deduction game. On reading the rules, I was a little nervous that it might be too light, but it can actually be pretty thinky. It's great with kids, too, and fun to see/help them work through the puzzle for themselves.

"Overall, Purrrlock Holmes: Furriarty's Trail is pretty fun! The nobody wins endpoint is kind of frustrating, gameplay-wise, but honestly there aren't many other ways to motivate players to keep going if the revealed tokens aren't great, points-wise. When it's good, it's a lot of fun, though, as it's a nice, simple deduction game with hidden information, a great way to lead into a game like Fugitive which is, perhaps, a bit more complex? I think I prefer it to Hanabi or Arkham Ritual, two other games in the "you can't see your own cards" genre, as it's fairly light and theme-y but also a fun little competition (and I've become less enthusiastic about Hanabi as time passes). I'm less a fan of the memory aspect of it, as you're incentivized to remember every card that's been drawn or discarded, but it's not that big of a deal unless you're playing with people with very good memories. Additionally, some people who prefer more pure strategy games might be frustrated by the random draw element, as it's possible to have two cards that give you insufficient information (Dead End Crow 5 and Dead End Crow 6) and two cards that give you near-perfect information for one guess (Lead Crow 5, Lead Crow 9). That doesn't bother me all that much, though. That said, if you're looking for a fun introduction to deduction games, though, Purrrlock is a good start!"

Perfect little deduction card game with simple rules but quite deep strategy. Top notch artwork

This is a great little deduction game for 7+, the artwork is lovely and the rules easy to grasp but with more depth than a game with simple mechanics should reasonably have. Very highly recommended.

正否情報と他カードから、自分の前にあるカードが何かを当てていくゲーム。手番が多い先行有利で、全問正解したけど4番手だったので負けたゲームがあったのでそこに対する改善点は無いか。（点数はランダムだけど）

My wife loves this for two players. Plays quick, which means after a long day of wrangling babies, we can get a low-stress game in before we crash for the night!

Really cute deduction game. We played 5 player and it was only hated by 1. I would gladly play this game again I think it does some things really well! I like trying to guess who your suspect is. I think the artwork is wonderful! It will be a nice family fame for many, I know!

Tried this out while at Origins 2017. I love the theme, and the game is interesting enough, but I didn't feel like it had a strong enough replay value to get on my I NEED THIS list. But if I see it for super cheap in the future I might be inclined to pick it up. It is a neat, little, light filler game. There are just better neat, little filler games out there.

A nice improvement on Sleuth.

In Sleuth you have to take detailed notes to do well. This game streamlines it so that just place cards to the right or left of your player board and you can narrow down your options that way, without taking any notes. Important cards go on one side, and dead-ends go on the other side.

The scoring is largely random as players collect face-down tokens that range from 1-3 points. It's possible that the best player could collect all 1-point tokens but somebody else wins because they got more 3-pointers. I imagine you could work around that if it's an issue, like playing with the tokens all face-up.

Overall the game is fun. It last 30 minutes or less and you get a nice deductive experience.

Not bad but possibly too simple for adults - unless they're bad at remembering cards, in which case they probably won't enjoy it at all. as to play well you have to remember what's been discarded. (You could keep the discards displayed but that makes one of the special abilities useless.)

RATING: 6
Lightweight deduction. Some memory game is also present, as used cards end up in the discard pile. Needs timing rules for the Paws action.

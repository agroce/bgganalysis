Not a bad game in the Ticket to Ride level of complexity. Very little competition in the game as you're only vying for the first to complete goals. The idea is just to optimize your moves - pack your truck and minimize deliveries to maximize points. For a gateway game, not bad.

Almost a little long, but still quite an enjoyable pick-up-and-deliver game.  The production is top-notch, and each turn seems just about the right length.  It does share some elements with [b]Ticket to Ride[/b], but the actions and planning are more AP-prone.

Fantastic pickup and deliver game.  Would be a great way to introduce players familiar with Ticket to ride into a meatier euro-game that includes action point mechanisms, along with order fulfillment.  

There are multiple objectives (popular vendor, selling goods for money, achieving open/secret  orders).

I think of other pickup/deliver games and absolutely love the simplicity, yet depth of the game.  

Games like Hansa Teutonica, and especially Container, just simply are too dry/mechanical compared to Cinque Terra.  

Highly recommended if you need a quality pickup/deliver game in your collection.

Couldn't be happier about this fantastic addition to my collection - my favourite pick-up-and-deliver game to date. It's a ton of fun harvesting and delivering fruits and veggies to market around the Italian countryside, and the gameplay is lively and interesting. I love the vibrant colours, and have modified the trucks so that they can literally haul produce. Avoid playing with AP-prone gamers if you can, though - they'll get mired in mathematical number-crunching rather than just enjoying themselves. I personally don't feel the need to analyse every last little thing before making a choice. And I know it's a bit of a trend these days to have boardless boardgames, but I really love an old-school board like Cinque Terre's, and all the better if it has a map on it.

Poor graphic design choices, the player colors don't match the player boards, the cubes/item colors are sometimes hard to distinguish. It's an overall uninspiring game -- ultimately forgettable. Don't play with five -- there is no way to really plan as it becomes about who has the cards fall right for them.

A highly underrated pickup and deliver game. Cinque Terre has some interesting similarities with Ticket to Ride in the aspects of the orders (routes) and the card collection and not showing your hand. It is one of my favorite games and has a lot of replayability due to the randomized setup.

RATING: 7
I'm a big fan of pick-up and deliver games, and this is a pretty neat one on the lighter side of the genre.  In Cinque Terre, players drive a truck around, drawing cards that allow them to pick up goods, picking up goods, and then delivering those cubes to towns for profit.

You can score points in two ways.  The first is that each town pays directly for goods.  The amount each city is willing to pay for each good varies, and will vary from game to game as well.  So, some games may be very profitable just delivering high value cubes, and other games may not.

The other way to score points is to fulfill demand cards.  So, maybe town A wants a red good and town B wants a yellow.  So, if you have made these deliveries at any point during the game, you can score that demand card for yourself.  It's a little Ticket to Ride-ish, as sometimes you'll luck into a demand card that you already fulfilled earlier in the game, and other times you'll have to work harder for them.

Overall, just a simple pick-up and deliver game that still stays interesting enough for gamers.

Similar to Ticket to Ride in concept but more convoluted due to the many order cards which have to be kept track of (for yourself and every other player). This just makes it feel like an annoying chore rather than a fun experience. This isn't helped by the poor graphics which made the towns indistinguishable and the van pieces which can't be moved without shedding their loads.

TTR minus route building plus a bit of pick-up-and-deliver. Bonus points for stylish presentation and quick playtime but luck of the draw seemed too decisive and the mechanical innovations didn't justify the complexity bump. Entirely possible that there's subtleties that whooshed over my head in a first play (seeing as I got trounced) that might elevate this from a well-produced pleasant pastime to a game worthy of attention. Ultimately, games of economics should have more economics, if you ask me -- Cinque Terre, with its fixed (albeit randomized) prices, just doesn't feel dynamic enough to me.

Gran juego de coger recursos y entregar para conseguir puntos(Pick-up and Deliver). Es muy simple de reglas pero te hace pensar para poder optimizar las acciones de tu turno. No hay apenas interacción con otros jugadores pero no por ello el juego deja de ser divertido. El diseño tiene muchos colores y a veces eso complica el familiarizarte con tu color.

RATING: 7.5
Pickup and deliver game, which is essentially a race between the players to harvest the most goods in the right combinations. There are a number of different strategies to pursue which keeps it interesting. The random placement of the goods and the changing value of the goods in each location makes the games replayable. 

The game also has a hidden objective element which means that while you have some idea of who is leading, the end gaming hidden scoring could make all the difference. 

Took about an hour to play with four players (3 of them new).

Interesting on the first play, but much less so by the third.  Replay value feels quite limited, despite the wide variety of order/point scoring cards.

RATING: 8
Efficient harvesting tends to mean inefficient deliveries and vice versa - there are no easy answers, most of the time, and that makes for a good game.

I don't know how deliberately interactive the card-drafting can be, but the race to complete face-up contracts / best vendor tiles is absolutely important - sniping one of those can leave someone (eg) scoring 2-3 points for bare deliveries instead of 15+ for deliveries plus contract.

Not sure how I'd feel about this as a 3p game, but as a 2p head-to-head it's excellent. (Edit: with 5p, it seemed like late-game saw too many "hey, I've already got that!" contracts popping up. Uninterested in further 5p play, but would consider 4p.)

The ultimate pick up and deliver game, which really doesn't sell it to me.  Kind of felt like a bummer when someone took something from you just before you could get it, and it was really hard to plan for anything but the cards you already had on hand (getting more required fulfilling the contracts that were hard to plan for or were stolen from under you, which I actively didn't like).  Still, I can appreciate the clean design and I'd be fine playing again.

Players are delivering fruit and vegetables in Italy, trying to fulfil contracts and score victory points.

Players take turns taking three actions.  Actions include drafting food cards in about eight varieties, which are required to pick up the food cubes from the farms.  Other actions are driving clockwise around the board, stopping to pick up fruit (paying the cards), or delivering the fruit for victory points, and possibly claiming contract cards in the process.  Claiming a contract allows you to possibly claim a secret contract for free - that you alone know about and can complete in secret for some bonus points at the end of the game.

Nice game - very close in feel to the recently released The Great Heartland Trucking Co., and also Finca.  The graphics in this game aren't great - the font on the towns is illegible, some of the colours of the fruit/vegetables are very close too each other, and the contract cards are a pain to parse during the game.  As is the norm these days, it's been done better before - I'd rather go and play Finca.

Moving around in a circle, using cards to pick up fruits and vegetables to deliver to cities on the other half of the loop.   It's okay, but nothing too thrilling.   Maybe better enjoyed by folks who absolutely love light pick-up-and-deliver games.   Feels similar to Great Heartland Hauling Co, which was also a bit bland.

[b][FirstPlayOn10thMay2014][/b] I bought this game for the sole purpose of playing it with my mom. I heard good things about how Cinque Terre is good with two. Another game that I expect to enjoy, but felt just okay.

My mom had some problems in tracking the number of actions she already took. So we introduced glass beads to help her keep track. She also had problems in looking at what she needs to deliver, and whether she has fulfilled the order card or not. From what I've observed, there were a lot for her to see, especially when she has a number of order cards in hand. 

She loves playing Ticket to Ride and I often relates how similar Cinque Terre is with Ticket to Ride. Probably for that reason, she decided to handle plenty of order cards at one time. I can see her improve over time after repeated plays.

One play, 5 players.

The game is pretty simple and easy to explain, entry level weight and complexity. Our game lasted 1 hr 45 minutes. That is absolutely unacceptable for this game. I checked out at about 45 minutes in and forced the end game earlier that it could have gone.

The game focuses around timing your pick ups with where you want to deliver, hopefully you have some synergy there...If not, someone else will and they'll score a truck load more points than you...Sorry.

Intro style game that offers more complexity to TTR, but much less fun IMO.

RATING: 6.5
A somewhat basic pickup-and-deliver game.  I like the need for efficiency when planning actions.  The biggest flaw, IMO, is that your actions have very little impact on the other players; it's more-or-less an efficiency race.

initial rating based upon a 5er game.

no issues with the rules, but otherwise i disliked everything else about this. the production was poor. (poor color matches, the board overcrowded and somewhat unnecessary. It's one of those games that you need to take a bit of time to follow what is going on, and how to plan your turn, but the game system is way too simple to put that effort into it. just DRAGS and overstays its welcome. 
will never play again. would rate lower but i don't believe its broken.

Fascinating mix of mechanics, think Ticket to Ride set collection for gamers in an Italian world of pickup-and-deliver, very quick to play especially with just two players.

Can easily play in under an hour with just two players.  Great use of pickup-and-deliver mechanic.  A good medium weight game, that is an excellent "next step" for people coming from Ticket to Ride and looking for more of a challenge and new mechanics.  Despite fairly straight forward rules (once you figure out how to score order cards correctly), it can be quite brain-burning and intense.

Several different ways to score points and strategies to pursue, although getting the good fortune of order cards which align can help - see my [thread=976289]session report[/thread].

I recommend using [thread=979360]improved player carts[/thread] which can carry cubes.

This is a very enjoyable pick-up and deliver type of game. The scoring on the 'starter order' is the only wonky bit, but it not hard to figure out once you've played the game a time or two. For the sake of clarity, the starter order card's points are always calculated the same way. If you 'made it' you score the point positively; if you miss one or more of the items on the starter order, you apply the score negatively. (30 - (items' values per city)) = Score

Colorful Pick up and deliver that has a nice engine building feel too.  There are three main scoring avenues.  Using any combination of them can be a successful strategy.  This balance makes the game feel well designed and developed.  The simplicity of the rules is complemented by long term planning and strategy supported.  Lots of fun and quick to play!

TTR Europe was our entry to modern board games but with 2 players it can feel quite separate with only the odd cross over point. So take the card collection mechanic from that, add a simple but thinky pick up and deliver game style, set it in a location we want to visit, make the game
Look great and the fact it plays really well with 2 ...this game has to be a winner!
As in ttr there is still the lucky card pull on order cards where by luck you have an order already done but that's just a element of the game. The fact you can push for high value goods helps balance this out I think. 

 Looking forward to playing this more with Sam as will be a few years before we can visit and walk between the five villages with Jasper.

Very fun pick up and deliver synergizing game. Not quite as much skrewage as say Ticket to Ride, but it feels to me, a little less luck based.

This is very close to the definitive average Euro.  The game play feels something like an inverted Thurn and Taxis with similar card drafting and route finding.  The goal cards felt far too swingy and I won because I managed to draw a hidden one I had already completed.  That can happen in TTR as well but at least there you can get substantial points from placing random connections.  If you drop off goods randomly in CT, you will never complete a goal the whole game.  Overall, fairly enjoyable and I would play it again but I will never be upset if I don't.

(05/15/2014) Comment based on 1 play.

Much under-appreciated, this is a very good head-scratching, true pick-up-and-deliver game, that combines elements and feel of [thing=9209][/thing] and [thing=38872][/thing].

Players drive a truck in a circular circuit, traveling through the mountains, harvesting fruit and vegetables (resources), and then delivering them to five coastal cities. Much like TTR and Jet Set, there are a number of "contracts" (similar to destination cards in TTR or routes in Jet Set) that players can fulfill for victory points. These contracts involve having delivered specific combinations of fruit/veggies to specific cities. The game ends when a player has fulfilled five public contracts or two resources have been depleted.

Like TTR and Jet Set, there is a short menu of possible actions: 1) Move the truck up to 4 spaces in a clockwise fashion, 2) Draw a harvest card, 3) Harvest/collect resources in a mountain space, or 4) Deliver resources at a city. Drawing of harvest cards in much like TTR; players will spend most of their time here, drafting from a four face-up cards or drafting blind from the deck. However, they must move the truck to one of the mountain spaces where this fruit/veggie is grown, and play the matching card, in order to load up their truck (max of 4 items). Then, then must move the truck to a city, and then expend an action to deliver. Although there are three actions per turn, the play here an be stop-and-go, with a jerky feel.

Interestingly enough, once a player has delivered a specific fruit/veggie to a specific city, the player can track on their tableau what has been delivered; there is no need to deliver a second one or a third, for the purposes of contract fulfillment. However, each city has an intrinsic "demand" that is randomly determined at the beginning of the game. Players can simply deliver a lot of one good to one city, and score lots of points if the intrinsic demand is high. If they deliver the "most" to a given city (there are only so many spots on the tableau), they can claim a "most favored" vendor card, which is similar to the game-end bonuses in TTR. The other twist is that players can harvest up to four resources in one spot, for one action, provided they have the correct resource cards; the same goes for deliveries.

Players also have secret contracts that they are trying to fulfill. Combined with the publicly available contracts and the intrinsic demand at each city, this becomes a very complex traveling salesman optimization type problem. Since you are forced to drive your truck in a clockwise fashion, and you are limited to carrying a max of four items, it is a challenge to fulfill both secret and public contracts. Usually, it is extremely inefficient to stop-and-go at each harvest location for single items, and then stop-and-go at each city location to deliver single items, in order to fulfill a single contract in a single pass of the truck. It is far better to pick up one large batch of resources, and then deliver them in one or two cities, and then drive the truck around again. In this manner, this game is far more sophisticated than TTR, and may even surpass Jet Set in terms of mathematical complexity. Although Jet Set has interesting constraints due to money, this game's novelty is in the mobility of traveling truck, and the hard constraint of four items.

The game is easy to pick up, but seems somewhat difficult to do well the first few games, due to the seemingly complicated interrelationships posed by the secret and public contracts, as well as the intrinsic demands. The key is to satisfy and maximize all of those, with the fewest actions. This is a solid game and welcome breath of fresh air. The only complaint would be that the fonts for the cities are terrible to read, and that the wooden carts could have been tailored to actually hold the cubes, instead of placing them on the tableau. There is also the concern that this game could start to feel "same-y" after a number of plays, as there is really no spatial element like in TTR and Jet Set--the only development you see is the slowly growing string of deliveries on every player's tableau. Other than that, this is bound to be a "classic" game, due to simple rules and gameplay, but with surprising depth that plays in 60 minutes. It deserves a well placed "8", with room to move up. I am somewhat puzzled due to its relatively low ranking (lack of visibility or distribution?)--this thing needs to be moving up, and moving up fast. I could see it easily rank in Top 100 or Top 50, but lack of buzz could keep it relatively underground.

Pick up and deliver.

The last few times I've played, I essentially went straight for completing the food orders and finished the game before everyone had finished their starting card. Has that multitasking balance of working on multiple goals simultaneously which is a nice little path finding exercise that I enjoy. I think most people focus on one food order at a time, which while will get the job done, will take more trips around the board to get it completed.

It is strange trying to explain to people how the starting food order works. It's worth 30 points total, but you will score some of it during the game (the value it sells for at the market) and then the difference at the end of the game. It helps balance things out instead of making it a flat 30 points, but I wish there was an easier way to explain it to players.

Well, it's hard to argue with the theme! This is a pretty attractive game, although the cards are a little silly-looking. It's a simple pick up and deliver game; I can't think of another true pick up and deliver game of exactly this weight.  The contracts are public, and players must compete to fill them first, which isn't my favorite way to do things, especially when there is a lot of information for players to digest.  Still, there is a really good idea behind this game and I'd like to see more filling this gap. (1 play)

Beautiful to play, beautiful to look at, somehow deep and yet easy to play (almost relaxing), GREAT with two players, retro and contemporary at the same time... We need more of this sort of thing. 

Edit: After many more plays have upgraded this to a 10. Each game has been really different, and it just gets smoother and smoother. There are various paths to victory and various 'standard' strategies but the variable set up will determine which of those will be best to pursue, so there's a puzzle in there too.

One of my favourite games of the last few years, easy.

RATING: 5
A very charming and colourful pick-up-and-deliver game, but one that doesn't particularly stand out for me too strongly.

I love the theme and the components, they scream of Italian sunshine and food.  The little pastel coloured vans you push around are very tactile - although they really should have been made so that you're cubes fit in the back...

The game has you going around a loop of fields and villages again and again, systematically picking up fruit and veg from the fields to sell in the villages for profit and to satisfy orders.  The orders look almost trivial the first time you crack the game out, but it soon becomes clear that delivering specific produce to specific villages is actually a bit tricky, as you are limited to 3 actions per turn and this never quite feels like enough to do all that you want.  This is a good thing, however, as it forces you to be economical with your movement and encourages you to harvest a good crop of produce before moving back into the villages to sell.

The sale values of all the produce are randomised by dice in the set-up phase of the game and are thereafter fixed.  I found that if there were lots of high-valued produce then the order cards became fairly obsolete, and the game seemed to favour the players that simply harvested and sold the most produce.  This isn't so bad with experienced players, but wouldn't be much fun for newcomers who put too much emphasis on the order cards.

I also thought that the game was a bit too long for what it is, I started to get a bit bored with going around and around for the umpteenth time as we got close to the two hour mark with 4 players (this game supports up to 5, something that I would not be willing to try).  This game should be 60-90 minutes maximum based on the simplicity of the mechanics.

A fun and bright game, but one which is only good - not great.

This game has a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209/ticket-to-ride]Ticket to Ride[/url] vibe all over it. Very 'flavorful' and colorful artwork. Would've been a nice addition if the cart could actually hold the cargo properly to really get into the pick-up and delivering. It misses some of the tension in comparison to ticket to ride, because blocking is less prominent and game choices are more emerging from solitary interest.

A solid pick up and deliver game that doesn't take two-three hours to play.  A solid mix of game mechanics make for a very accessible game with plenty to think about.  I have only played two players.  While this game plays well with three players, it may become more chaotic with 4+ than I would enjoy.

The key to winning the game is getting the open contracts in order to draw a new hidden contract.  You also have to be very cognizant of when the game is about to end.  If a player only needs to deliver four goods to a city to close it out for his fifth city/contract, the game is on borrowed time.  That player can control when the game ends.

You pick up fruit (colored blocks) and deliver them to cities to get points, fill up your board, and meet goals on cards requiring delivery of the fruit to various cities. The rules are not that complex, but it requires looking at the cards in play and other players boards to decide what to fulfill. So there is definitely enough challenge.

I like the somewhat unusual theme as well as the artwork, but for a family game the setup is somewhat cumbersome and clunky. It also seems like there is a huge amount of luck in the order cards.

RATING: 8
Light to medium weight game that at first didn't make my heart go all a flutter, but I played it a few more times and started finding more depth. There are several easier decisions to make - which region is more attractive to harvest from; do I sell to help fulfill an order and get points later or for the immediate points I can get now; how can I get the most sales (and hopefully points) at a particular city, but additionally there are secret produce orders that you can use which turn out to be much more important strategically than I originally thought. Do I take an order into my hand because I think I can fill it quickly or because I know that one of my opponents can fill it quickly and I want to prevent that? If I do take it, how much effort will it take to complete it because any unfilled produce on that order counts against you at the end of the game. Additionally, any produce orders you take into your hand remain a secret until the end of the game so you have no idea who has fulfilled how many orders, and the points that they are possibly worth at the end can be huge. After four plays I am finding it more engaging as the strategies and depth emerge. More than just a "pick up and deliver" game. Fun!

Acquired and played a couple more times but the shine wore off. Luck of the draw wore thin. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I remember scoffing at this one when it first came out and never bothered to be interested in trying. However, after a friend playing one of my games and being a good sport, I decided I should return the favor and play one of his games and this was pulled out (it was between this or Tikal). This is a pretty simple pick up and deliver that is quite an interesting puzzle in efficiency of actions. I really enjoyed my play and am likely looking to acquire a copy. This would make a great family game while still keeping the interest of gamers.

Fun pick-up-and-deliver game! Very bright and colorful game and I love the geographic theme (I have personally been to Cinque Terre and it is quite beautiful!). Not an overly difficult game because of how simple actions are but trying to plan what orders to fulfill and trying to guess what others are going for can be tough at times. My one complaint is that the goods fall out of the trucks so easily, which makes it difficult to move the truck when it has more than one good.

A fine light game, like Ticket to Ride meets pick up and delivery.  I wish the market for each item fluctuated, and could see house ruling something with the dice (either stepping them down for each item delivered or rerolling them.)  Turns go quickly, kind of bland, but not bad.

There's a popular method with designing German style games where the player is straight-jacketed with what options he has.  Cinque Terra is a study in this style of design.  In many ways it feels reductive of Ticket to Ride: the card row or random draw, the exchange of cards for that color of thing, the "tickets" that connect villages in specific ways, the fact that the board can be re-scored at any time without confusion.  But then there are odd parts: the lack of choice in movement direction, the arbitrary game end conditions, the overwhelming randomness in the game set-up to (presumably) combat anyone trying to solve the game.  Indeed, I've never before seen a game that came with sixteen dice (and a dice bag) that used dice as little as this game.

A family friendly pick up and deliver game.  You are trying to satisfy orders for various goods.  You go to farms nearby Cinque Terre and travel to towns in the area on your truck.  You acquire cars as one of your actions.  The cards allow you to get vegetables and fruits from a farm that grows them.  You can then sell them in different towns and get points for them.  If you deliver vegetables and fruits to all the towns on an order you can claim the order at the end of the turn and score it.  

You also have a more complex order you are trying to satisfy longer term.  I really like this game as I like pick up and deliver.  It is relatively light, but good fun.  It is a good game but not great as some of the game play becomes a bit repetitive.

So I have a lot to gripe about for this game but the impact of these things could be fairly low depending of your tastes or care level
--bad user interface 
-the game is hard to read. poor font and no reason to call a place by its name rather than "that place".  
-it tried to have every type of thing distinguished by color only.  Should have went with tokens when they ended up having white, gray, and black cubes; and player colors that were blue, dark blue, and black.  (this bothers me a lot because its such a stupid mistake)
-pick up and deliver seems like such a waste.  I just couldn't tell if it had much of an impact, and it seemed to have an arbitrary limit.  It would have probably worked better if it was a more complex map or even just doing away with the limit of 4 spaces
-artistic design.  Though the art looks good, it just cant be appreciated.  Places are oddly sized bubbles. map is arbitrary and thus bland for no reason. player mats seem blocky and out of place compared to the map. huge player pieces for no reason.
-having everyone get one last turn seemed more like a slap in the face and it more often than usually was worthless

ok yeah its rough and a BIG problem for the game is it doesn't take long for all the negatives to hit you.  But the positives take 2 or more plays to appreciate
+random set up, very random and variable but the board is solid so it doesn't take long, this is a big deal
+easy to learn and understand
+strategies to win can vary 
+theme and art is not only good but it fits well
+market game without money needed
+there may be a bunch of different goods but it all acts the same, no pointless restrictions
+a turn consists of multiple different actions 

neither good or bad thoughts:
game could stand to be longer as you can do three actions on your turn.
the game has just so much potential its sad how much I don't care about playing it again.
I think this game needs a new version much more than any game 
Its just so close to being one of the best gateway level games but it has so many FIXABLE problems

1/13-14-rcvd this the other day and though it was sold as new it was obviously used. no shrink, card decks unwrapped and rubber banded, insert mangled and torn.  after a disappointing first inquiry to target language in which they insisted that the game was 'new', we did iron things out and i am keeping the game after a refund of $6.49.  

we played it twice and it is LOTS of fun.  while comparisons to Ticket to Ride and Finca may have merit, i think this one is just a bit more complex, and we really enjoyed it.

Delightful little pickup-and-deliver game that balances action optimization with goal choice: Highest profit? Most popular vendor? Hidden orders? Public orders?

Well-produced game but the pick-up-and-deliver mechanic is fluffy soft and a bit too light for my usual gaming group.  Around and around the Italian coast you go, picking up "vegetables" (which could just as easily be rocks, kittens or plates of pasta) and delivering them in a fairly rote, predictable manner.  I just never saw myself reaching for this title over say [b][GameID=9209][/b], so away it went.

It's Ticket To Ride with some pick up and deliver. That's it. It plays fast. But it's still basically multi-player solitaire since there's no way to affect the other players except by indirect screwage of taking the card they were hoping to get, and the vp provided by the pick up and deliver mechanism is very easily calculable/solvable in terms of the best actions (I won by a good 15 VP at least). I suppose I wouldn't say no to playing it again, since it's at least slightly more tolerable that the stupidity that is TTR, but only if there is no other game open.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I've been close to picking this one up a few times, this is still the best family weight pick up and deliver game I've played. I'd love to play again, especially since it was a hit with both of my older kids. I'd still recommend it if your looking for an introductory pick up and deliver game that still has plenty of replay due to the variable set up. Cinque Terre is going back on my wishlist... and I've since picked up a copy and have been enjoying a bunch of 2p games with my older daughter.[/i]

[i]- Perfect gateway/family weight pick up and deliver game.
- Beautiful board and artwork. I love the use of color in this game, everything pops. The wooden delivery trucks are awesome too.
- This plays great with 2, which is always a huge plus for me.
- Variable set up [i](each game the 5 towns will pay different amounts for certain goods)[/i] and multiple ways to win this game.*
 
*This game may seem random at first, but that is only if you are focused on collecting the order cards. You can also focus on delivering certain goods to the towns that are paying out high prices that game, which in turn will also put you in the running to collect the Most Popular Vendor point tiles.[/i]

A cornucopia of fruits and vegetables that players harvest and sell in Cinque Terre.
A lovely game where the game set up is unique to every game.
The dice rolls determine what produce will be desired most in each city.

Each turn you either move your truck to harvest produce or sell produce in the towns.
Each produce that you sell will be collected on your player boards and are reused in scoring victory point cards.

Good game for families and school kids (maybe). Colorful and cute theme. A few drawbacks: eg multi-player solitaire: get cards, buy goods, sell goods. Very repetitive. No "take that" ability to shaft other players. Can't change the prices during the game (maybe needs house rule: first person to complete/get more than half a city resets the dice?). It also seems unfair to be stuck with an unwanted contract late in the game, especially if this is how you end the game.

This is a great gateway game with a fun pick up and deliver mechanic.  You have a limited number of options each turn, but it still gives your brain plenty to think about each turn, as you try to maximize the effect of the actions you choose.  It's fun deciding if you should make a delivery in a town simply because the value of a good is so high, or if you should deliver the good somewhere else, so that you can complete an order card!  Nice and colorful too.  Excellent game!

RATING: 8
5 Plays - Cinque Terre seems relatively simple, but actually requires a bit more thought than you'd expect. The pickup and delivery mechanic works like a 'rondel' of sorts, with players needing to decide what they will aim to deliver in their 'next cycle'. Players may choose to delay moving, in order to wait for more profitable cards to appear in the display. Or they may need to weigh up whether to chase 'special order cards', race to be the first to deliver a set amount of goods to a particular town, or simply go for quick and fast points by delivering produce with a high sell value. This isn't a deep game, but these decision points are more puzzly than you'd expect for a 'light game'. 

There isn't a lot of direct interation, but there is enough to keep it interesting and more than a multiplayer solo game (I would disgree with others who say otherwise). For example., you need to look at what special orders other players are going for to make sure you don't work toward something that later is gone. You need to watch which towns people are aiming to become the 'most popular vendor' for so, again, you don't forfeit valuable points. And you also need to make sure that you take valuable cards from the display as they appear and capitalize on goods that have a high sell value. 

There's a little luck, but a player who plans well, will score out-score those that don't by quite a lot constantly. 

A great light game. The extra time length (60mins is stated) is a plus to me, as it separates it from other light games and fills a niche.

Fantastic gateway game.

RATING: 7
In this pick-up-and-deliver game, you move your truck clockwise around the board, picking up fruit in the backcountry area, and then delivering it to the five towns.  Delivered goods are placed on your player board--if you have ever delivered certain types of goods to the cities listed on one of a handful of public contracts, you can claim that contract.  Taking a contract allows you to take a private contract--but if you never complete it, you are penalized.  This game encourages you to try to optimize your moves, but makes it really difficult.  You can save time by picking up fruit from the same backcountry space, or by delivering it to the same town, but if you want to complete contracts or even sell fruit where they're worth the most, you're going to need to go at least a little out of your way.  There's some nice tension here, but the random nature of the contracts, and that someone can snipe the one that you spend the last four turns working toward, can dampen the experience.

Nice gateway of pick up and deliver mechanic.  It felt like a cross between Ticket to Ride and Splendor.  Other than filling orders, hidden goals, I liked how goods had different prices for different cities.  Seemed to have nice different ways to trigger game end.  There was competition watching your opponents' order filling as well.

Game seemed to trigger many end conditions at once.  Game seemed a little repetitive traveling in one direction to pick up and deliver.  Felt like only progression was when new orders came up.

We love this game. Great game for 2p. The only complaint I have really, is the graphic design which doesn't seem to fit. It's my opinion that am Italian market game should have "markety" or classic Italian themed graphics instead of the modern typography and modern vector shapes that make up the patterns.

With that (superficial) complaint being the only one, I can say the game is close to perfection. Jenn approved!

This is a really nice looking pickup and deliver game that's unfortunately all about the luck of the card flip. Players drive their truck pieces in clockwise circles around the board, and draw cards that allow them to gather fruits or fill orders. As you make deliveries, you put markers down next to that town on your board. Having markers that match in color and location on your score cards is what makes them generate you points, which means if you draw cards that have similar requirements, you have a huge advantage. Disappointing.

This is a wonderful next step family game.  None of the decision in the game are really any more complicated then the ones in a game like Ticket to Ride.  The difference is you get to make a lot more of them, and there are more proverbial balls to keep in the air.  It makes for a nice easy to learn game that is still engaging.  Gaming veterans won't find a huge amount of challenge in it, and that will keeps its scores lower here on BGG.  Still there's a fun times to be had here, especially with family and friends.

I'm glad we played this game as it provided some great examples of things to avoid in future game purchases.

There's no interaction with other players. Aside from a race to satisfy the visible market order cards or trying to end the game when you're ahead, you may as well play two solitaire games and compare your scores. Even if I had some clue what hidden orders others are trying to satisfy, there's almost nothing I can do that has any effect on any other player.

The player boards are annoyingly fiddly. My wife's sleeves kept brushing her board and moving her cubes. While not necessarily a fault of the game, it's something we may consider avoiding for future game purchases.

The game dragged on and on and every round felt the same as the last. There's very little in the way of build-up except for the occasional lucky match against a new order card.

Perhaps some of the ideas from Santiago de Cuba could be incorporated here: When you drop off produce at a location, reduce the value on the die by one for each item. When the value reaches 1, re-roll.

Pick-up-and-deliver efficiency game. Has been compared to TTR but lacks the tension of that game while having a similar level of rather humdrum and repetetive routine movement.

I was put at an advantage at the start by picking up three olive cards worth six each - maybe a card draft at the beginning would be fairer?

--Jan2014-- Amusing; light; clear.  I know folk for which this would work very well.  But - on a sample of only a single game (so take this with the proverbial grain of salt) it seems very random.  I won my first game by a dramatic margin; and can't claim that I played significantly better than the others.  I did collect more beneficial cards (that I'd either already completed, or needed only a single delivery to complete) than my colleagues had:  and that seemed to be the margin of victory.  (edit) And we also played slightly incorrectly; so I'm revising my rating up a tick imagining that things would be better if played correctly.

RATING: 5
I want to like this but it comes up short in a few ways. The components could be better. The colors on some of the produce (cards and cubes) are too close. The colors on the player trucks are very poorly chosen. The board design means the cards are always in the way of scoring chits in one area. I love the theme of this game. And so the cubes would be so much better if they were shaped like the fruits/vegetables. The cubes should fit on the truck as you drive it around, rather than sit on your board. The rules are not well-written in places. In particular the needlessly confusing "starting order" card rule. The game plays too slow with five players for what it is, and perhaps a bit slow with four. The potential for AP is there, which will ruin what should be a light and quick-playing game. And I would strongly recommend house-ruling in the TTR mechanic of flushing the card tableau if three of the four produce cards showing are of the same type.

My favorite pick up and deliver game. It has a great theme, tight smooth gameplay and timing is of the utmost importance, which I love in all of my games. There's a lot to think about here. The dice dictate the prices of the goodies so every game will bring out different pricing combinations to work with. Add to that a ton of cards with different goals that can be obtained publicly or hidden in your hand, and the replay value is huge. Flows very well with two players so a definite keeper.

You want as much overlap between the things you're doing but others are going to try for the public ones as well and that's where the strategy comes in. Fun game.

Initial thoughts after 1st game:

This one came to my attention after watching the Gamenight play through and a review by the Game Boy Geek.

Was sold on the continual references to Ticket to Ride, but as it turns out the only similarity to TtR is in the card drawing for produce. Other than that it turned into a very thinky game that did hurt the brain a tad towards the end. In fact after initial setup and rules explanation, the game actually took over 1.5 hours to complete and by the end, wifey had a complete meltdown and just spent the last few turns harvesting produce and selling at villages for the highest price.

Indeed everyone at least once missed an opportunity to collect a public objective card, until it was pointed out later on during the next turn. I also noted that everyone started by concentrating on completing their initial secret objective card, before moving on to the public ones…

Love the theme and the game mechanics. Definitely worth another few plays once everyone is more comfortable with the game play.

Dry, dry, dry. 100% boring efficiency exercise, with a huge problem: the game makes it super hard to actually be efficient with anything. Everything is so slow. And boring. There's no engine here, just slowly drawing cards, slowly moving around the board, and slowly waiting for the game to end.

Best part is the components... and they are cubes.

If you like exciting games, sty far, far away. This game was described to me as a "Pick up and deliver" game... and it's exactly what it sounds like, with not even anything around that or inbetween. On your turn you are either picking up, delivering, or drawing one stupid card (you need a lot of cards to do anything well)

Each player drives a wooden cart piece in a clockwise direction around the 8-space (3 fields/5 villages) game board harvesting 8 differently colored produce from the fields with matching colored cards in order to sell in the villages.  Two sets of 8-colored dice represent the value of each commodity in demand in the villages.  Extra "lire" (basically victory points) can be attained by fulfilling "Order" cards that specify the deliver of certain goods to certain villages.  This is a simple "pick-up & delivery" game that makes up in color components what is lacking in player-interaction and game depth. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a pretty simple entry-level pick-up-and-deliver game. The random setup (starting bonus card, dice rolls and locations, goods locations) should increase replayability, although I'm not sure how much that really matters for the gamer crowd. Of course, I don't think that crowd is the target audience anyway.

--- Summary ---
The board shows 5 towns along the Italian coast, each with 2-4 colored dice chosen and rolled randomly; these are the prices for each of the 8(?) types of goods. Goods (n+11) are stockpiled one type in each of 8(?) locations along a road in the Italian countryside, with 3 stops (each accessing 2-3 types of fruit). Start the game by placing your truck in any location. Players each get a hand of goods cards and one goal card.

On your turn, spend 3 action points. Your options are:
- move up to 4 spaces clockwise
- pick up goods from your current location (countryside) by playing matching card type, or a pair of matched cards as a wild; max truck capacity = 4 cubes
- deliver goods to the city you're in; earn VP = die showing, or 1 if die not present. Cubes are placed on your player board in spaces matching cities (if no more spaces available, may not make sale)
- draw a card (there are 4 face up; may also draw from top of deck)
In addition, may claim one of the bonus tiles if you were the first player to completely fill all the cube spaces on your board for that city; worth 8-12VP. Or claim one of the 2 face up bonus cards, which show a combination of cities with specific fruits; if you have delivered that combo (look at the cube colors on your player board), may claim the card for bonus VP. If you do so, look at the next card and either keep it in your hand (for end-game bonus) or add it to the face up display. If you keep it, add the next card from the deck to the display (there are always 2 of these cards face up).

The (2-player) game ends when any player has claimed a total of 5 bonus tiles/cards face up in front of them. Then, score the VP for cards in your hand and lose 5VP for any unfulfilled card. Most VP wins!

I kept messing up my plans by looking in the wrong direction and passing up key delivery/pickup sites.  I think this one has potential though.  In a way, it reminds me of a very stripped down version of the pickup/delivery system in crayon rail games.  Would like to try again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a very simplified pickup and deliver game.  There are 7 spaces on the board, 3 where you can pick up goods by discarding matching cards sort of Ticket to Ride style and 4 spaces where you can sell those goods for differing values.  Also like Ticket to Ride while selling those goods gives you immediate points you are also trying to fulfill orders that give large point bonuses for selling specific goods in specific areas.

There is just so little to this game though, each round you can do 3 actions, either draw a new good card from 4 face up and a face-down deck (also very reminiscent of TtR), pick up goods, move, or sell goods.

This is too breezy for me, even for a game that teaches pickup and deliver pretty easily and plays in an hour or less.  Also, the luck of the draw with the goods in this game can be way more brutal than something like TtR for example and you can find yourself getting screwed by chance.

It is a very pretty game though and very pleasing to look at.  A grown man I played this game with kept exclaiming uncontrollably "this is so cute!"  But you gotta have substance behind a pretty face and this one is pretty vapid.

A gateway euro which utilizes a pick up and deliver mechanic to complete contracts. While I know it is a light game, it didn't hold my attention. For the length of the game (we did have a 5 player game), it went on too long compared to level of depth the game offered. I would much rather play ticket to ride, which provides a bit more strategy and tension for a gateway euro.

This game is the perfect blend of simplicity and depth. Even though the rules are incredibly simple and straight forward, this game can be a real brain burner. It can be difficult to hold in your mind all of things you want to do on each pass. 

I also love the components and the bright colors. It makes the game vibrant and cheery and a very enjoyable playing experience.

Wish I could like this game more. It's lovely to look at & fun to play, but too often seems designed to frustrate. 

The trucks are nice but aren't big enough to actually hold four cubes, (or the cubes aren't small enough to fit, whichever), the trucks should be smaller outright which would help the parking crush at some harvest spots. But making them JUST big enough to ALMOST carry the harvest limit seems cruel.

And with such a bounty of food the theme permits, why choose & illustrate items so nearly identical in shape and color? (Ex: the Garlic & Mushrooms, Oranges & Tomatoes) This can really make reading the public order cards a challenge, or at least too easy to mistake. On the order cards they even managed to make Olives and Zucchini look very similar!

Wish I could focus more on playing the game and less on decoding it.

This game is an accurate simulation of my life: running around in circles feeling like I'm accomplishing absolutely nothing.  But as I'm a sucker for pick-up-and-deliver games, I did quite enjoy this one.  The rules are nice and straightforward, but there is surprisingly a lot to consider as you're winding your around the Italian countryside.  The physical production value is mostly pretty good, and the chunky wooden trucks are a particularly nice touch.  However the score track isn't very good, and my biggest complaint is that the font used for the city names on the game board and cards is nearly indecipherable at first glance, making it hard to distinguish between the various Italian names.  All in all, it's a great game that I might have been even more excited about had I not recently also tried "The Great Heartland Hauling Company" and found that to provide a similar, but more streamlined and compact, experience.

For a lightweight pickup & deliver game of simply going round & round & round, this was quite enjoyable. A good combination of drafting cards to enable pickups, sequencing actions to work with the cycle, and combining deliveries for instant profit with more diverse (but less profitable) deliveries to satisfy public or private objectives.

I wouldn't like to play it with AP-prone players, though.

One play - 4 players.  I like pick-up-and-deliver.  I like games with simple rules that are deeper than you expect.   But, after one play, this didn't grab me.  Perhaps it's the programming aspect to each turn (each player has 3 actions/turn), or perhaps its the repetitive style of game play, or simply that the game outstays its welcome - well over an hour for a four player game. Despite the cute theme, the game didn't really engage the players with less table talk and more silent optimization.  Should have stuck with Palaces of Carrara or Firenze. I suspect this works far better with 2-3 players.

Pickup and deliver at its most basic. The balance seems to be a little off, as instead of fulfilling produce orders if you target the high value products you can earn more points. With this strategy it breaks the wonderful theme, and overall is less enjoyable. It plays a little longer than it should, with the level of decisions that are required. Overall a solid game, just not one that will hit the table often.

The similarities to Ticket to Ride and Finca are there, but also hints of Capitol/Skyline 3000 in that it helps to pay close attention to what your opponents are staging for so as to more effectively make your plans. Quite thinky, but much of the thinking can be done during opponents turns. The game end result is quite driven by how the cards treat you, as you might expect in a game which uses so many cards. Well polished design. This may become a staple for the one hour game length bracket.

Excellent game. It takes a couple of mechanics from Ticket to Ride and mix them with the "sales person" optimization problem. There is some luck but overall it plays fast and is very entertaining.

Cinque Terre is a pick-up and deliver game. The board has a set path where players advance clockwise through a series of cities and then through farms where they can harvest plants (cubes). Cubes are assigned to farms randomly at the start of the game. In our game the first farm produced tomatoes, lemons and mushrooms, while the second produced oranges and green-stuff, etc. Then the cities are seeded with dice randomly, which are colored to correspond to the farm goods. Some cities only could hold two dice while some could hold up to five. The pips on the dice indicated the value that farm goods could be sold for in that city, if there wasn't the appropriate die, then you could sell that good for a single buck.

On your turn you can do three actions. The actions are a)Move - up to four spaces b) Havest - Take goods from the farm you are in by spending a matching good card (or a matched pair of cards of something else). Note: you can only hold 4 items at a time in your truck. c) Sell goods at a city for whatever the the dice says it is worth. d) draw a produce card from the 3 face up cards or randomly from the deck.

When you sell goods, you put a marker on your personal player board showing that you sold that good to that city. This is important because you're trying to fulfill contract cards that want you to have delivered specific goods to specific cities. At the end of your turn, you can claim one of the public contracts if you've completed it and take the associated points. If you do, you can look at the next contract card and take it into your hand or decline it and it replaces the contract you filled. If you decline it you can randomly take a contract card off the top of the deck into your hand. You also start with a contract card that wants you to have delivered something to every city. It's worth a good number of points. You only get points for contracts if you completely fill them. Uncompleted contracts at the end of the game will cost penalties for everything you didn't do.

Additionally, if you are the first player to completely fill your player board for a city (which means delivering 10 things to them) you get a city bonus. The cities that hold more dice (and reward more money for goods) are worth less than the cities with fewer dice.

Whenever a player has completed 5 public contracts (or city bonuses) the game ends. Everyone gets a final turn and then you score all your hidden contract cards from your hand. Most points wins.

I really enjoyed this game. It's a pure pick-up and delivery game without a lot of frills. There's some randomness if a contract you can already fill pops up, but not much other than that. Your initial contract and the distribution of the dice cubes can hurt you a bit, but not a lot.

This is my preferred set collection game (a la TTR). Some people seem to have a really hard time figuring out how the game works, but we find it elegant.

It's cute, but there's really not a lot to it, and for such a simple game the rules are annoyingly unclear in spots (the rules on ending the game are clear IF you already know what they're supposed to mean - otherwise they can be read in a number of different ways). I'd much rather play Ticket to Ride, which it somewhat resembles. (If I were to play this again I think I'd want to borrow from TtR and add house rule for flushing the card display if it has too many of the same card.)

Excellent gateway+ game.  A step or two above Ticket to Ride.  A really great game for its type.

Update: I originally rated this a 9 and was thinking of dropping it to an 8, but after reading all the 5 and under ratings I've decided to go the other way.  This game is a gateway+.  That's what it is.  It's excellent at being just that.  It's deeper than Ticket to Ride.  It surpasses other games of its type that were released around the same time such as Africana which at this writing is stupidly rated better.  I've played Africana a half dozen times.  It's got a major 2nd player advantage problem that's glaring in a 2p game.  This is the better game.  Period.

Only 4 poosible actions; take any  3 (repeats allowed) each turn.  All 4 are very easy to execute.  It's trying to remember what chain of events you want to accomplish that gets hard when you have multiple source cities and multiple destination cities to track, and they must be visited in the order provided by the ciruclar route for the moves to be efficient.

Neat little mental puzzle, distilled pickup and deliver, fulfilling orders, interesting but not really exciting.

family game. like TtR but pickup and deliver.
move around. pickup goods from x villages and drop off.
open central contracts (set colleciton) which can get you points.
some variable setup with dice rolls at start of game make some goods more valuable

This is a goosed-up version of Ticket to Ride without making it overly complicated. It's a slow-moving game for a lighter affair, though, which works against it as a family or gateway game. I was pleasantly surprised by it.

Solid Euro in the light to medium weight category.  Love the theme of this one.  Some of the analogies as it being a lite TtR bear some truth.  The dice in this don't really add an element of luck.  More like they establish where the best victory points are to be gained.

A remarkably ordinary game.

I like pick up and deliver games a lot, but this one is just missing any real reason to play it.

It doesn't really have any character, and it is a relative pain (and not that much fun) to pay attention to all of the various delivery permutations.

In some aspects one might view this "pick up and deliver" game as somewhat repetitive and boring.  Yet, it's actually fairly engaging and a bit of a brain-burner when it comes to trying to keep track of multiple orders, and managing the ever-changing order-fill priority.  I view this as an under-rated game that is actually fairly fun, despite a rather boring theme.

Very similar to Ticket to Ride except that the "Routes" you complete are shorter, meaning that if you can find a way to collect many at once (by concentrating early on filling up the all player route cards), you'll have a fun and exciting game. Alternatively, you can concentrate on trading with the most value or being the most popular trader quickly. It's a very simple and easy game, particularly for Ticket to Ride fans, but there is sufficient strategy to make it a little heavier than everyone's favorite train game. I didn't like it much because of how circular and quick the game play is; there's not a lot to do and it gets repetitive. Kinda boring, but not awful IMO.

Solid game with easy rules, except for the bonus card that everyone starts with which is slightly confusing. Pick up and deliver.

RATING: N/A
It's a mentally draining game, as you try to watch how your board can match numerous goals with numerous requirements, while keeping an eye on your opponents' actions and how their boards might beat you to matching those same goals with varied requirements.  Don't let the bright, friendly, simple-looking board fool you:  This game is complex to play.

I am [b]really[/b] not sure what I think of it yet, but I definitely want to play it again soon, while I still have those neural pathways trained….

Solid pick-up-and-deliver. I love that the route is one way--definitely requires planning ahead.

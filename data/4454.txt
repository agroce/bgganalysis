This was a great statistic base football game.  I remember we even try to come up with drafting rules and then played a mini season.  Unfortunately Avalon Hill decided to stop providing the statistic.  I think we played this game to death since it usually requires at least 3 hrs to finish one game.

Played once.  On the right track in some ways, (e.g., dump-off passes to RBs, defensive linemen/LB "box"), but ultimately an asinine game which ignores inside/outside abilty of running backs, and rates them solely on average per carry... and some RBs will actually catch more long passes than wide receivers!

Third Edition, Avalon Hill.
Box shows mild to moderate shelf wear, but there are no split corners and it is solid.  Game is complete.  Only two teams have been unpunched: Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers.  All other teams are unpunched.  Action cards are punched.  Board is like new.  Score pad is full.  Nice set if you want to relive the 1984 teams of the NFL.

This is the best sports simulation i've played. American football lends itself well to this format with the actual flow of the game split into manageable plays. Actual player stats for the season make this a good replay simulation but with the added element of making all of the play decisions, excellent.
I wish I could come up with an equivalent design for real football :)

A pretty good American Football game. We took two weekends to complete one match usually. We also made our own offensive/defensive choice cards which the later editions included. And I used to record each play and make my own stats. Aaaah, happy days. *** Playing again now, and today we did a whole game in under 10 hours, with a meal break and learning new rules. After a few games, we've got most of the rules and stats down pat, but we're still making odd mistakes.

As a big football fun i want to love this game but it has a few flaws.Too many turnovers.It is not uncommon to see each team have 4-6 turnovers a game or more.The injury system where a guy like brett favre can be sidelined the whole year cause there is no mercy for those who played the whole year.So losing your main weapon can totally change a good team and make it bad.Wish they would have used the same injury type system as in the statis pro baseball game where a player missed a number of games based on how many games they actually played in.

RATING: 8
I recall this from a long long time ago.  Pro's:  good game w realistic football feel and stats.  Con's:  Too long, a bit of bookkeeping on each play; needs some variants for defensive/offensive scheming (plays are short/med/long pass, inside/outside run w/ play action or draw added on--defense is even more basic).  It would be easy to come up with your own off/defensive playcalling variant, as they basically just add or subtract points on a 12 point scale depending on the play matchup (i.e. as it is, draw is + pt against a pass defense but - pts against a run defense).  Good for a day of football, but no way you'll have time to play a season out of it.  And computer simulations (and even arcade football) now do a much better job of crunching the numbers (check out Front Office Football @ EASports.com)

A great concept for a game - where the play may be directed to the offense, the defense, or a combination of both. These mechanics were ground-breaking, because, suddenly, a great defense would be less likely to give up a lot of points, almost regardless of whom they were playing! The only drawback - it takes a LONG time to play. Definitely needed a dice version to supplement the Fast Action Cards, and speed up the game.

Utterly dreadful. At best, a statistics generator, and not a particularly good one at that. Overly complex game play had no pay off, unless you got some kick out of having all those player cards (some with the scantest of info on them.) Really highlights the boring, down side of American football (opposed to, say, the chaotically entertaining Canadian game.)

Time consuming, but no more so than watching a real game on TV, and works reasonably well solo.

Fun but flawed game. Ultimately fails to create an 'open' system where you can do whatever you want with your players; too many gamey opportunities open up.

Jim Barnes' STATIS PRO FOOTBALL is another outstanding football board game by Avalon Hill/Sports Illustrated.  It is very detailed and puts you in control of an entire football team as you manage your roster, make substitutions, make play-call decisions, and work toward achieving victory against your opponent in this NFL Football masterpiece.  STATIS PRO FOOTBALL makes you focus on offensive and defensive line play and life in the trenches unlike any other.  You stay engaged in this tactical sports sim.

Difficult to enthuse to madly on this in retrospect, but back in the 80s, as one of Maggie's Millions, this kept me sane.

It's a hard game if you're not familiar with American football, but easy to understand once the mechanics sink in. The main issue is that it's slow. You have to be remarkably accomplished to finish a game in less time than the real thing.

Paydirt offered a much quicker version (with less realism) that only took an hour, and which offered me the easiest gaming win I've ever had. Let's just say that my brother gave away his copy of Paydirt after that session.

But Statis Pro, if you have the time, are committed/anally retentive/obsessed by gridiron, is the only true way.

Really, really solid.  Long, without a doubt, but a great balance of offensive and defensive playcalling.  Alignments on both offense and defense really make a difference, and even things like choosing where to run the ball is great.  The level of decisions here is amazing, as you have to really look where your team is matched up well against the other team.  In addition, it's pretty easy to tell who your good players are, as most of them have very simple rubriks to see how well they perform.  And, best thing is, the teams really feel different.  Best football sim I've played that uses individual players.

Plays this game with my 6-year old son. He is actually doing quite well. This is essentially a rock and scissor game were both players try to outguess each other. It is however hard to beat a clearly superior team. Very statistics driven, but if you really are into NFL Football, this is it.

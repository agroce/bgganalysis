Backed on Kickstarter, very excited. I would buy it for the beautiful art alone but looking forward to the amazing gameplay. Junkspirit games is a great team making incredible games like nothing else out there. I own their first game Junking and it is easily one of my favorite card games, I am looking forward to buying the games these guys put out for years to come . I just am happy I found them early on because I don't want to miss a thing.

I purchased by Order of the Queen at Gencon 2017.  This is one of the better looking games I own.  It is just gorgeous on the table.  The colors are bright and vibrant, and the art is just fantastic.  I enjoy the board design as well.  Everything has its place, and the bright colors do not detract from the game play whatsoever.  Really, I adore the looks of this one. 

The game is quite simple and luck based, but as the designers were likely trying to design a thematic amaritrash family game, I am quite happy with the product. I do not have many thematic ameritrash family games in my collection, and I am quite happy to own this one.  

The game is much like a simplified Eldritch Horror or Albion Legacy, where you are making skill checks by rolling dice.  A big part of the game is selecting the party that will go adventuring, which establishes the potential dice rolled as part of the skill checks.  This part of the games feels new, and I think this is a fun part of the game.  

The actions do become a bit repetitive over time, and there is lots of luck involved, but the game is still quite fun in its simplicity.  

One thing I do not care for is the discarding of item cards after one use (apart from your starting item card).  They are hard to get, and by discarding them, there is little sense of progression.  I use a house rule that we get to choose between three items, and we keep the collected items throughout the game.  This makes the game easier, but as the game is hard anyway, I am ok with the change.  Also, I do not mind if this weight of game is a bit easier to win, than say, Robinson Crusoe or its like. 

The game can also go a bit long for some family members, but as I often play games over the period of several days, this isn't much of a problem for me either. I imagine that the game can be easily shortened, but I personally have not felt the need to do so.   

In conclusion, I recommend the game as a family weight game. Also, if you are a sucker for gorgeous games, this may be for you regardless of your play style.

This is a tough call for me, as I kickstarted it, and I love it! Art and components are fantastic, but it's hard. Like, really hard, and in a way that feels very arbitrary. It's a fun game, but feels like there isn't a lot of strategy involved at times. As the threat levels ramp up on the various tracks, there's just not really a lot you can do about it. You can try and complete quests, but you're at the whims of whatever quests happen to pop up- if it doesn't give you the reward you need, too bad. On top of that, completing the location cards for the quests is frustrating- you can try and have a solid party for them, but most often, there will be one character trait on the location card you just won't have enough of in your party (that you'd have had no way to know to try and prepare for), to be able to have a decent chance of succeeding- and the penalties for failing those quests is steep. I realize this is supposed to be offset by the queen's favor tokens, and the items, but getting those is quite few and far between as well, so you really don't have as many options to hedge your bet as you'd think. Overall, the game feels kind of one track  and linear so far- you go and do all the things you can do during the round, making sure at least one person has tried to kill the horde, and one person has tried to fulfill the queens order, and then everyone else does quests because that's all that's left- and if you're lucky, you might get the ones you need to reduce the threat tracks on the most pressing zones. It hasn't so far felt like we were really strategizing  as much as I thought we would because your options to pursuse the rewards that would be the most helpful are only open to you if they happen to come up- it's entirely possible that due to the cards, you might not even have a chance, which is a bit frustrating when the game runs so long. I certainly don't mind a hard game, and usually expect it for co-ops like this, but a lot of the difficulty here feels completely out of the players hands, like you're only going to win if the game lets you and not because you played well. Overall, I still like the game, I just don't see it getting played much without house rules for some things because of this.

What a lovely game. Bought it for my son and I to play and it didn't disappoint. Art work is AMAZING. Nice quality cards and pieces. It is easy enough for my 8 year old but enough meat for a gamer. It is a dice game so if you dont like dice to be the main mechanic for succeeding or not this might not be the game for you. Really fun story lines to go through. My son gave it a 10 I had a 9 that is the 9.5. Great job Junk Spirit Games. Can't wait to play more with my son.

Oustanding art and good world-building. Let down by excessively simple gameplay. It is worth owning for the art alone, if you care about that, but I have no plan to ever play it again after my first few tries.

Initially, I had some trouble getting into the game.  After a few turns reading the quests and thumbing through the coloring book, my son (7) and I really started to feel the epic nature of the game. 

Pros: Excellent story components, absolutely love the quests, this is a highlight of the game and makes it a true fantasy experience.
Imaginative art.
Good difficulty and progression mechanics.  
Easy rules.
Great for kids, except for the timing.

Cons: The play time is long and it moves a little too slowly given the complexity.  On the other hand, playing too quickly means missing out on the role-playing piece, so speeding up the play diminishes the great upsides.
There is too much of a contrast between fighting the minion hordes (too much simplicity) and the questing/queen's order components.
The difficulty is a bit high, the cost of missing a few rolls can be the game, you just won't know it until the end. (Needs a stronger "recovery" mechanic)

I think there is a lot of potential here to reduce the epic time commitment, without damaging the epic feel of the game.

Great looking cooperative game with a cool theme. It plays like a lighter kid version of Eldritch Horror. The theme is good and the stories on the cards are nice, but the theme doesn't really come through in the gameplay. On top of that the game takes too long, which is very unfortunate.

Quality and art are amazing. Family friendly. Think shadows over Camelot minus the trader mechanic. I have played 3 games at this point and won 1. Gameplay is easy to pick up and to teach. There is a little AP when gathering your heroes for questing. With that said, there is a little luck (dice rolls) involved but each hero has its part to play. Would recommend highly for families with kids 10 and above. Game play is easy but there I a reading aspect that might frustrate younger gamers.

Received my KS edition this month and just played it. It's a fun, light and adventurous family game! I enjoyed completing the quests and battling the monsters/nemesis. Can't wait to play this game again! The art is just stunning and cute!

Edit: Amazing first game! My wife and I enjoyed this game even though its quite long. Definitely recommending it!

I received this game on July 17th 2017.  I played it twice just over this weekend.  I love the indepth game where there are many events going on at once, and as a team, need to try and prioritize to get everything under control.  LOVE THE ART!  I enjoy this game and will play it on my own as two different players if I need to.  The first time I tried to do a quick dry run to get the feel of it, I got sucked in and played for over an hour, (yes it is that engaging) and the second time, my 12 year old and 10 year old played also. The only downside I can possibly see for others not enjoying is the length of time it takes especially if it is their first time; not a quick pick up game. Not me though, I love indepth team games.

RATING: 4
Played only a single 4-player game of this and will never play it again. The game lasted for 2 hours and consisted only of rolling dice but with no way to mitigate those dice whatsoever. You don't have interesting choices or much control of what's going on, since any choice you make has no weight and backfires more often than not (you can't be lucky since you always need only one success, but you can be very unlucky and get no successes on 10+ die rolls in a row). Maybe this could appeal to a certain crowd (although the game length makes me doubt it) but it's definitely not for my group of seasoned gamers. Don't get influenced by the ratings of the KS backers, just buy something else. The game isn't horrible, but very random and very light for the time it takes, and components are good. It's just waaaay overrated at the moment (8.2 with 50 ratings).

Just one 3p playing, but even with a sleeping 9-year old performing nothing but queen's orders, we trounced. Only one quest was performed and enough monster slaying to keep them at bay. Other than that - easy breezy. The artwork is Adventure Timish. Its limited player actions are good for introducing to youngins. Overall, good enough game.

Extremely fun co-op which is bursting with flavor and charm. Won my first play through by the skin of our teeth. Seems like a relatively simple co-op which is largely based around mitigation of luck via selection of heroes, the large amount of queens orders, nemesis, location and event card should keep the game fresh for at least a few more runs. Also simple to teach so probably great for younger gamers.

Love the art, theme and cooperative play but it's too long, repetitive and too dependent on luck  for our liking. We all prefer investing the time in Mice and Mystics, and would pick that over this every time because you actually get somewhere with it and have some interesting decisions to make and a great storyline to boot - things that are missing in this one. It was worth a try though.

As a "procedural" story telling game, I enjoyed it for what it is: a game that I can break out when I want something cute AND tense. It is a game where I can, sort of, relax because this game doesn't require you to think two steps ahead, yet it remains tense because of all the dice rolling. 

As a co-op survival game, however, I am a bit let down by one major aspect: there's too little options for threat mitigation. In contrasts to it's cute theme, this game has a very high difficulty, on par with XCOM: The Board Game. Thus, the lack of threat mitigation options, when coupled with very high randomness all across the game, becomes all the more obvious because often, if someone does badly in the dice roll, there is no recovering from it and the effects are felt for many turns to come, often right towards a lose.

I still enjoy the game very much, because despite the matter of threat mitigation it plays like a simpler, cuter XCOM: The Board Game. However, I think there is room for improvement so that it feels more rewarding, more tense, without changing the core of what makes this game great.

A decent game. Took us several hours in a group of 4 playing for the first time and did not even play it through. Too long for my liking. Gameplay felt repetitive after a while, only trying to keep one of the threats down. 
Beautiful art!

Will play the game again but with 2 or 3 players to see how that affects the duration and gameplay.

Played this game two times and really liked it.  The group's excitement sadly fizzled out the more we realized we were going to lose.  The bad part was that we kept playing a while to confirm our suspicion both times.  The mechanics of the game are easy and fun, and the art and components look great!  Overall it is a fun game. I forgot that we could pass a card after every round.  We will see how much of a difference that makes next time.

RATING: 5.5
I would have loved —I would really have— to enjoy this KS just for the fact that I truly believed there was some greatness in it. But hopes are not reality, and the reality is that this is a hard as nails game to won. Do not be fooled with its kind graphic design —which is great, by the way—, this game will make its best not to let you achieve one iota of a sense of being able to do something else that see the end at the turn of the corner. 

In that way, in the frustrating sense that, no matter what you do, you are not going to defeat the monsters or, by any chance, complete one of the queen's orders before one of various game end conditions are met, 'By Order of the Queen' is a disappointment. And, in my dictionary, that is one of the worst things you can say about a game.

I really like this game! Beautiful artwork, really nice components, I love the little stories on the cards and the mechanism is fun. But I don't think I'll play it very often because for a family game it takes WAY too long. I played it with my wife and we had some bad luck rolling dice, so it took us well over two hours. And it also felt like well over two hours because nothing new happens over time and we never felt like being close to losing.
I would absolutely love this game if it took 45-60 minutes to play.

After several games and zero wins (not even getting close), I've found this game to be too punishing to enjoy. I love the art and lore, but there are critical flaws with the amount of randomness and complexity of the game. The six attributes add an abundance of complexity to the game and force players to carefully consider the heroes selected in their party. This, coupled with frequent location cards that do not match the symbols on the back and punish you with an automatic failure make the game feel like a grind to the end rather than turns of pleasure. The combat mechanic is my favorite aspect as, even with "bad" rolls, generally there is a feeling of progress by removing some/all of the monsters.

Overall, the game feels like a more difficult version of Eldritch Horror.

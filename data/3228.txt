Kind of a neat puzzle game.  The sacred areas add some variability between games.  Interesting, but I don't think I'd ever request it.

RATING: 6
Essentially a 3D tile-layer, very abstract (themeless), but also quite innovative.  Seems to scale well, has a semi-cooperative aspect to it, and interesting in that it's all about not scoring points.  Lots of opportunity for strategy, both with the block-laying, and the timing of the chieftain's movements.  Have yet to try the variants or advanced rules.  Dry and a brain-burner, yet oddly enjoyable and not overly long.

Decent "3D/building" game.  Very "negative" game, as you really have no way to help yourself, just hurt others.  Another one of those games that plays decently and looks really intriguing on the table.  

Scoring track is kinda screwy though...but has no impact on gameplay.

Just played it at Essen, and whilst I appreciate the logic behind it, I definitely found it too 'dry'. My opponents seemed to really 'get into it', but what the kerfuffle was about, I don't know. I didn't win, and to be honest, I didn't really care. (I'd just won 'Mexica' so I was feeling smug).

It's not that I had problems with brain burn or spatial visualization difficulties as some people seem to have done.

It's a cool concept, and it's very well executed.  And it's thematic!

My only problem is that the inspector does the whole round-about thing at the end.  It didn't really affect us too much (the positions of the score didn't change, although all the scores FLEW up).  I'd have to play some more games to see how much it affects the game.  It might be for the best to have it, since you can mitigate your mistakes during the game play. 

Would happily play again though =).

not as cool looking in person as it seemed in the pictures.  i really like the idea of the roving chieftan and the way scoring occurs.  exceptional leader bashing with more than 2 players, but with just 2 i think i'd rather play all sorts of games.

RATING: 7
A nice 3 dimensional building game.  The nature of the scoring emphasizes the 3D aspect as each face of the structure matters.  Planning ahead and accounting for your points will assist in better play.  Players must balance the 'offensive' vs the 'defensive' options of block placement.  Defensive play has a slight edge.  Fans of or those skilled in spacial relationships will likely enjoy this one.  [GTI Code: AGSD]

RATING: 8
Similar to Rumis, but trying to hide pieces rather than show them.  Very clever building game that scales well from 2-4.  Easy to explain and can be played in an hour.  Game starts slowly and then the tension builds towards the ends of the game as the pyramid builds higher and the blocks can be scored for more points.  Lowest score at the end wins.

I have played this twice as a 2-player game.  Although I find Pueblo to be interesting, especially when using the cult sites and demolition variant, for some reason Pueblo just doesn't stand out.  I guess this probably makes the chieftain happy.  Pueblo has a similar theme and look to the Mask Trilogy.

Pretty fun for a pure logic, no luck game.  Playing with the &quot;cult tiles&quot; (which prevents you from using some of the spaces) is pretty much required after you get the basics of the game down, otherwise the games become predetermined.

RATING: 8
Our ongoing quest, to play the games that should have been taken out of the wrapper ages ago, reinforced my admiration for the Kiesling&Kramer duo. A thoroughly entertaining hit by a team that seems to be incapable of producing anything less.

We had the board on a rotating platform (read IKEA salad-dip presentation accessory) and that surely is an essential gadget if you want to play this and keep sitting down. 

p: Simple rules that can be explained in seconds, the bare minimum in ingredients, original use of that 3rd dimension, playtime of less than an hour, and thoroughly challanging overall. What more do you want?

It's always nice to see someone else come up with great moves in games, and this is one of those intriguing games that keep me thoroughly involved during other player's turns, despite that there is nothing to do (apart from influincing their moves through rolling commentary off course). It can be a wait if people over-analyze their options. But as long people keep that for the few turns where it really matters (and hence are easy to forgive), rather than as an ongoing attitude, than that is something I have never had troubles with.

To come up with a game as elegant as this with only one type of brick in different colours is sheer genius. Chess needed 6 types to create a staggering variety of possible board situations and strategies, it looks like this game too can be played many, many times without getting into situations that are too familiar, using only 2.

And, it has to be said, where most 3D games out there are souped-up 2D variations or featured in an sf-movie-staff-room, this one has found a truely creative use of the boardspace, that 3rd dimension is integral to the design and yet, the way they have incorporated is so obvious and simple, and the building block shape used is so elementary that you wonder why it took so long for this game to appear.

It does seem to have a couple of flaws though, but where there are games in which the same flaws would possibly put me off, here I am much more forgiving and I expect this game to come on the table a lot over the coming weeks and have no reservation with giving it an "8".

I do expect I will like it (even) more as a 2-player game, because of those (suspected) flaws I mentioned earlier. I haven't played it enough to give much weight to my hunch that turn-order does affect your victory opportunities, as it should be easier for the opening player to have your blocks hidden by other blocks AND place them on lower levels. But my main reservation is that balanced play relies on fellow players making sensible "inspection" moves. It is too easy to pick on single players giving them no hope of winning despite good play. Games that have that "weakness" often rely on some balanced choices between players about who should be targeted. Misjudgements can easily lead to spoiled games for one or more players.

The advanced game offers the opertunity to auction off turn-order twice in the game, paying victory points. This seems to be a simple fix for my turnorder advantage reservation, but with a tendency to target the person who is visibly ahead on the scoring track, it might make the problem worse as the one going last will be the one who is targeted as the leader, whilst they are likely to pick up the difference in points towards the game anyway. Haven't tried it, but it seems to be hard to put a "simple" value on turn-order, so not sure if auctioning off is the answer.

This is a very original and genial game. A true gem. Players try to use their 3D pieces to build a structure. Half their pieces are coloured, and they have to show in the building phase and once the work is completed as few coloured pices as possible. Tricky. While the work is in progress a pawn (the shaman) is moved by players around the construction area to inflict penalty to others. The winner is who will receive less penalties.

Beautiful Kramer & Kiesling abstract game, for me is a must. 

What a clever idea... the supervisor penalizing the bricks that are not fair to him. Wow, Quality Control in the North American Indians buildings!!!    

With 3 or 4 players the board looks beautiful at the end of the game with combinated bricks of different colors.

Always willing play this one. I love this game.

A truly unique game. The simplest of mechanics, but such deep play. Stacking blocks in 3D while constantly trying to avert misery. 
Don't let the Inca theme fool you. Games don't come more abstract than this. Pueblo will primarily appeal to the mathematically inclined.

RATING: 7
Kramer and Kiesling do it again!  Simple rules but a lot to think about it.  

It reminds me of Patchwork in the sense that it's an abstract but doesn't feel (much) like one.  Players place 3-dimensional blocks either of their color or neutral while an inspector goes around the outside trying to see their blocks.  If he does, they get points which is bad.  The higher the block is, the worse it is.  So, it's all about trying to place blocks where they can't be seen.  

I've played it with 2 and it works well.  Not sure how it'll be with more (potential for kingmaking).

Bumped up my rating because this IS the game I play the most. It is quick, the board is different every time (because you are adding building blocks to it) and I have a great partner to play with. We will probably never play this game (unless teaching it to someone new) without the cult sites - definitely more challenging because you are effectively removing some spots on the board to place your building blocks. With my usual partner - this is the new chess for me!

Good game, actually, but very abstract and difficult to grasp. It seems either you can think in the advanced spatial ways that the game requires, or you can't - in which case it may be quite frustrating. It's a game in which the required skill is very hard to learn, which is perhaps why it didn't grab me as much as it seemed like it should (although I am usually pretty good at these things). A classic "bubble game", I'd own it if I could get it cheap, but haven't yet been tempted.

Hasn't quite hit me (yet).  The spatial principles are obvious on the first few plays (as Fawkes says, build in, build low, build behind the chieftain) but the depth and replayability is not.  Many potential opponents have a mental block against spatial problems.  This game seems to depend highly on whether players have good spatial visualization and also can find some deep strategy in here. Hasn't happened with us yet.

This game has simple rules but challenging play, and definitely gets points for originality.  We play this 2-player, but it feels more like trying to solve a puzzle than competing with each other.  Take others' advice and put the gameboard on a lazy susan.  (You need to be able to see the board from all sides as well as from above.)  The layout of the scoreboard makes it easy to make a mistake in scoring, but you get used to it after a couple games.  I have yet to do well at this game, but want to keep trying!

Beautiful, chunky pieces, trivial to teach and with a lot of tactical niceness. Plays quick, and can serve as a great gateway or filler. Keep in mind that it is perfectly calculable what your next best move is, so one must employ simple strategic heuristics (eg. build low, build behind the chieftain) to gain an edge. Just make sure people play fast and play with the Burial Sites pieces. Lots of fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The spatial nature of this game feels very fresh and appealing. The fact that you can teach the whole thing in 120 seconds is nice.  The pace and length of the game are also just right.  

It doesn't always feel like there are a lot of great options for where to place a block.  But its not all tactical.  Sometimes your best move is to put one in a counterintuitive place based on what you will do (or 'force' someone else to do even better) in a subsequent move. 

But the real fun of the game comes from being clever about advancing the Cheiftain (or Shaman or whatever he is).  Its particularly satisfying when you force someone to give themselves penalty points to keep you from doing even worse to them.

I've not played any of the variants yet, but they look good, too.  Its really a very abstract little game, and I'm not usually the biggest abstracts fan out there, but this one really works for me. 

I was a little suprised at how nicely this works as a quick filler (or can work).

RATING: 6
This title has some interesting spatial thinking involved and the presentation is wonderful. On the surface the idea behind the game is simple, hide your colour and try to get the Shame-an (heh) to notice the other player's placements as much as possible. In the early going this is relatively easy to do, but as things progress it can become very, very difficult to effectively hide your blocks. Minimalistic yet fun. Replay ability seems questionable, but the sacred sites would probably help in that regard.

A very solid game. It is essentially a block building puzzle but its still interactive since your pieces and your opponents are all struggling for space on the same gameboard. Think of this as a kind of 3-D blokus. I think it would also have great appeal for a broader audience, women, children and non-gamers. This game and Rumis are of a similar nature and appeal.

Interesting 3 dimensional puzzle game in which players place pieces in an attempt to obscure their color as much as possible while maximizing exposure of opponent colors.  Players move the chief around the board.  The chief inspects the growing structure.  Points are given for number of showing squares according to the level of the square.  At the end, the chief makes a final lap, stopping at each and every space.

A very unusual design which made it to my wishlist thanks to Fawkes' excellent review. When I saw it at a sale, I bought it blindly. This game is downright nasty despite the simplicity of the playing pieces, and although it remains a somewhat dry counting excercise, the construction of the pueblo makes it a worthwhile effort. It is not often that you actually *get* to build something in a game! I like the 2p-game sufficiently to attempt to play it with other people, but I have to be exceedingly careful not to play it with friends or relatives prone to analysis paralysis.

[b]Update[/b] So at long last (at least several years after writing the above), I played this with more than 2 players. To be honest I found the experience disappointing. This game is basically a multiplayer puzzle where one can quite thoroughly figure out the cost of placing various game pieces. There isn't any tension of being a more clever builder than your opponents here: it is a repetitive business of avoiding the game of the overseer while pointing out the flaws of other players all the time. Blocking other players is hard to do: everyone wants to stay compact and small and hide behind the others. Players are penalised for creating constructs which seek to make building blocks difficult, and the result is a tepid experience. Probably this is why various variants were introduced—I'll make a point of attempting the game with the sacrificial sites. Perhaps then it'll become a bit more lively (although the point counting will remain).

Game has an addictive quality, though is best played with people who enjoy looking at options, not with those who just plunk a piece down.  My copy (bought three years after the game came out) came without the chieftain, or the players' pieces.  Ravensburger does not support games that are not part of their current games line up.  That stinks.

Personally, I enjoy this game because I happen to be fond of spatial puzzle-y things. But if you're a fan of [i]schadenfreude[/i], you should also check it out: the game punishes everyone, so you get to spend other players' turns watching them squirm to avoid taking too much disfavor. Not so much my thing, but another fellow I know loves it for just that reason.

[Best with the "auction turn order" option, once you've played once or twice.]

Production: Thick, heavy pieces that don%u2019t slide around unless told to do so.  Nice board artwork.  Play: I enjoy the puzzle-solving in this game, trying to either immediately hide my piece, or to at least keep it hidden from the chieftain from his imminent perspective.  (3 1 3) (4 plays)

Intriguing abstract game.  Players alternately build neutral coloured and their own coloured blocks to a common structure.  The &quot;overseer&quot; stalks the perimeter of the structure and awards demerit points if he spots your colour in his lovely building.  Clever game that plays in just the right length of time, and is trickier than it looks.  If you can&#039;t get enough, you can double the length of the game by pulling it all to bits again, scoring as you go!

Like games like this anyway - geometric / spacial / piece placement.  Was concerned it would be too much like Rumis / Blokus 3D.  Different enough to own both.  In this case, you want less rather than more of your color showing.  The vantage point for scoring unwanted points changes each turn.  How you place the vantage point marker affects your positioning.  Played 2, and then 4, and all liked it.

A very dry abstract where you alternatively place coloured then neutral pieces, scoring points where your coloured pieces can be seen. Lowest score wins.

It is highly dependent upon a players spacial awareness skills and as such can be a huge point swing when one player has noticeably better skills than the other. 

Whilst the components are good, the board and scoring track are quite busy and I really struggle to find anywhere good to place my pieces. 

Not the game for me

I lost badly, the game's secrets didn't reveal themselves first time, but I really liked it. The pieces are shaped oddly, and are identical, so rotation doesn't give you any help. I do want this game, so it stays on my wishlist.

Played 4 times. Though more "chaotic" with 3 players, I much prefer 3 players to the 2 player game. I find this game interesting, but not heavily replayable, and don't mind admiting that part of that is due to the fact that no matter how much thought I put into gameplay, I never win. Not even against newbies I am teaching the game to. The game isn't broken -- I am. Played basic version. Normally, abstract games aren't my thing, but when they involve buildings or cities, somehow I get suckered in. ANYWAYS, I didn't like this one too much. Nice to play, would play again, but very dry. Gets a 5 because it's unique. Maybe a 6 when playing with the "cult sites" (blockers).

I've mostly played this with the kids (10-13), and it's a nice fast game for weeknights after homework.

There are some tricks to learn here and we have gotten better with repeated plays, which has made it interesting.  For me this game works well as a fun filler that's a change of pace.  Serious AP types or four slow players might mess it up.

RATING: 9
[Spatial, Building, Cooperative/Antagonistic, Time Management] {2P:9, 3P:9, 4P:9} A breath of fresh air. Pueblo is a game about Master Builders trying to outdo each other while building a Pueblo out of identical bricks. They need to hide the bricks of their signature color, or the old Elder Shaman will Shame them for being too prideful. The story of this game always brings a smile to me. It's original, it fits the mechanisms and the game presentation, and it really works to make the game fun and interesting. No one wants to be shamed! Or, you can tell the Peeping Tom story instead. :) This Kramer/Kiesling creation looks like a toy when you open the box. After reading through the simple rules and playing a few turns, players are quick to discover it's definitely NOT a toy. It's an excellent spatial recognition and forward planning mediumweight game. Do not overlook this underrated, largely undiscovered gem. *** UPDATE: After several more plays, including the advanced version with the taboo sites, my opinion of this game has increased. I'm sure it's got a lot to do with its uniqueness, and the change of pace it provides from the usual German staples of investment, trading, auction and hand/resource management games. At this point, I think I'll be playing Pueblo regularly for a very long time. However, I still don't understand the Tetris comparisons. Tetris is a 2D game where the objective is to fit the pieces to complete a row and have it disappear, keeping the structure from getting taller. Pueblo is nothing like that. See my review for the skinny, eh? :)

RATING: 7
More fun than "Rumis" (aka "3-D Blokus"), in that you need to hide your colored blocks from "view".  As long as you have enough neutral blocks to keep your colored blocks from view, it doesn't matter how high you build ... but remember that the final turn is every single square around the border of the playing area, and each corner means a vertical view from above.  The vertical views are how I lost my first (and so far only) game.  Which is what I will try to keep in mind the next time I play "Pueblo".  Played this with Mr. Billington again today (7-10-2010) and I won this time.  I definitely learned from my last (losing) game.  Build low as much as possible; it's the upper levels that penalize your score a whole lot more.

Fun and pretty light 3D puzzler. Good way to end a session. Unfortunately, there's a pretty strong turn order advantage for earlier players. You can use the auction variant to get rid of it, but that pretty much requires previous experience with the game which doesn't work too well as a light-weight evening ender.

Also, it's disconcerting how the blocks can always be exactly the wrong way around...

A recent acquisition (February of 2015) that I had long had desire to own.  I once had a copy of Rumis, but Pueblo is so much better an example of the 3D game genre due to the unique Chieftan who continually circumnavigates the board inspecting the work of the builders.  I love the negative points being given the name, "Points of Shame!"  This is really popular with teens and not so much with my wife. I think that Pueblo is not as much fun as I imagined, and parted with it via the Geek Market.

A bit of an abstract brain-strain every time I play, but still engaging. Nicely designed (although I question the choice of turquoise & purple as colours for the bricks for 3 & 4 players!)

Pueblo is a curious abstract game from my boys K&K wherein you win by taking the least amount of points. On your turn, you place a block, move the chieftain, and take points if one of your blocks is showing. The amount of points depends on how high the block is. 

PROS
-It looks weird but cool on the table.
-The theme is meaningless but I kind of like it. 
-It somehow engenders a lot of laughing and poking fun.

CONS
-It's difficult to see how you could improve your skill, playing better from game to game. 
-It may feel samey after a while. This game might be one you play every six months or year and feel fine about it.

NOTES
-I haven't played the Demolition game but it looks like it could add a fun wrinkle.
-I haven't played with the sacred sites or auction. To be honest, I can't see how the auction would add much to the game. The sacred sites, on the other hand, could be good, but it would add extra punishment in an already brutal game.

RATING: 7.5
Components: lovely blocks
Complex: easy to teach
Weight: light- medium
Players: 3-4 (works with 2 but not as well)
Length: less than 60 mins
Opinion: a game for spacial vision, you have several blocks (more or less half in your color and half neutral) and you place one a time (following pairs of neutral-own color), then you move the chieftain. And the chieftain does not like to see discrepancies in the building, so he will penalize any color different from a neutral one.
The game can be taught in about 5 mins, and you rapidly understand how it flows, but, on the other hand, has quite decisions to take and you need to learn when to place a neutral or own block, and how much the chieftain will move on your turn (from 1 to 4 spaces) as sometimes is good to get some penalization if others get more.
In the end you have a nice picture of a Pueblo, after some fun thinking where to place your block. Tension in the movement of the chieftain and joking at your opponents if they are getting lot of bad points
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pueblo has been modestly enjoyable through three plays.  It plays very quickly and the blocks have a nice feel to them.  I would never suggest the game, but would play again as long as three conditions are met: (1) We must have three players.  The game stinks with four - not enough control, rampant kingmaking, and inability to force your opponents to move the shaman where you want him. (2) We must bid for turn order.  The first player's advantage is so huge that it's probably insurmountable with competent play. (3) We must place some of the ritual sites.  They make the decisions more difficult and add a little variety to a game that rates poorly in that area.

A very fun abstract-ish game.  Works well with about 4 people, with a smaller number it's best to include the 'holy sites' mechanic.  The only detraction is this seems to be prone to analysis paralysis with some players.

I wanted to buy this game some time ago, but it kept moving down my list of "games to buy based on reviews". When I finally got to play it, it met my expectations and turned out to be as good as I thought. I am usually not a fan of "abstract" games but this one was intriguing because of its simple mechanisms and player interaction. I have yet to buy it, though.

I may have sabotaged this for myself by coming to it via Rumis. (Specifically, several people have looked at my copy of Rumis and said, "Oh! I think I've played that! Are you... is there a guy who walks around and looks at things?" and eventually I found out what game they meant.)

So. Not that this would have to be Rumis to be good, but I did miss two big things. One, Rumis' variation in piece shape makes for slightly longer tactical arcs (how long do you hold a good but awkward piece?) and more surprising moves. And two, in Rumis you want to build higher; in Pueblo you want to stay low.

Both of these differences mean that in Pueblo you don't create your own opportunities; any move you can make, someone else can make before it's your turn again, and opening up higher altitudes on the board isn't freeing, it's punishing.

There are games fitting that template I enjoy, but they all have bursts of initiative-- moments when you can benefit so much from making yourself vulnerable that it's worth giving your opponent that free swing. Pueblo didn't seem to, which made it not just frustrating but more like joyless. :(
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pueblo is my favourite "stack of blocks" game. The watcher mechanism is great and makes it a "game" rather than an "activity with scoring." (In short, placing your [poisonous] coloured pieces is no problem so long as you can get them covered by the time the watcher comes around. If you can get your opponents to cover them with their pieces, so much the better.)

This is something completely different from the rest of my games, which is why it deserves it's place. It's like playing multiplayer Blockout with similar pieces and being worried how much your blocks are visible from the outside ring instead of trying to make even layers. When you add the Indian burial grounds in the play it makes this game scarier than any Poltergeist. Just beware of the centrifugal force when the going gets tough and good building slots scarce! :)

Pueblo is a very unique "tile laying" game that is nonetheless straight forward. The short of it? On each turn you place this strange L-ish-shaped 3 dimensional block down (either your colour or neutral) and then move the chief around the board (up to 4 spaces along the track) in an attempt to have them 'see' other players pieces and as few of yours as possible. The catch? For each piece in sight (multiplied by its height), you get demerit points. This active screw your neighbour becomes a balancing act which sets up players for the final scoring in which all spaces on the track are scored. Given its simple mechanical structure, it's easy to teach, yet is still filled with gamey decisions. NOTE: Still, like other Kramer games, it is best played with players who don't lock up and shut down the flow of the game -- especially since it is a tactical game (and not a fully knowable strategic game).

Another neat way to describe this is like a spatially-shared placement game with a "pain suit".

Simple rules and fast play, yet subtle and profound, requiring deep geometric and tactical thought. In other words, the simplicity of the design overshadows the complexity of winning play, and this is just the basic game! After being disgruntled from playing a bunch of stupid games with stupid mechanics, here is a game design that is so much more, and gives hope that there are indeed very good, simple game designs out there. As for theme...what theme? The joy is in trying to solve this 3D puzzle, trying to screw your neighbors, without screwing yourself.

I wanted to try this game and got to do so last night.  I felt that it was a really interesting game, but there was a tendency to hit the preceived leader, but the mechanisms of the game didn't really show who was leading very well at all.  It lead to a final "take it and like it" move against me (the leader on the board as the game wound down) and I ended up being in dead last place after the final walk around.  I would be much happier with a version that has a mechanism to determine where the chief guy goes rather than the perceptions of the players take the game down a false path.

Played a couple of games of this after playing Rumis, not hard to see where the designer of Rumis got his idea as it is the complete opposite of this but very very similiar at the same time. 

While in Rumis you are trying to have as many of your pieces showing as possible, here you want to hide as many of your pieces as you can. I would say this is a little more strategic, not surprising coming from the master K. This also has the added element of the Shaman who moves around the board to 'look' at what pieces are exposed, this penalizes those who have done poorly and/or have not moved the Shaman to their advantage. 

I also played the variant where certain spots are sacred, wow does this ever make it tricky. This is a great little 25 - 30 minute strategy abstract game

RATING: 6
Reminiscent of Rumis/Blokus3D, but also with the "look at the side" element also seen in Cityscape.  Scoring is bad, so you want to place your pieces so the token moving around the board doesn't see you, and you want to place the neutral pieces to block off the worst of your colored pieces.  It's an interesting puzzle game which you will enjoy if your head doesn't explode.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2012)

When I played Pueblo on 2012 I liked it even thought I felt it was a very hard game for me. I still consider it a very hard game (spatial games are difficult for me) but I rate games much harsher now.

The game looks gorgeous, but after playing it again, I found it is a regular game for me. I’m pretty sure there is a deep strategy that is escaping me but I feel that the game is mostly about how the other players can hurt you (moving the chief targeting the leader), that is, there is a lot of “take that” in the game and I no longer enjoy most games that feature this. Also the game is kind of boring for me. I prefer to play it with 3 player maximum, with more the structure an change a lot before your turn comes again (no control). Due to this, perhaps it is best as a 2 player game, a true battle of 3D wits,  but I’m not willing to find out. It seems to me the first a player have an unfair advantage over the rest, but I´m not completely sure.

Paper-thin theme. 

On the good side it plays very quickly and it can be explained under 2 minutes. 

Bottom line, a regular abstract game for me. It can be fun if played with the right group but Pueblo is not a game I particularly want to play often. Many friends love it. I thought for a while of buying it, but as I don’t enjoy it much AND it is very expensive, I don’t think I will.

Maybe it's just that I'm no good at spatial thinking, but I found this game too brain-burning for the amount of enjoyment I get for finding a good move.  It deserves wider exposure for its unusual mechanism, but it's just not my type of game.  For a game that uses all four dimensions, it feels awfully one-dimensional to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very cool abstract game. With the use of the sacred sites you can continually change the board play dynamics. After people have played the game a bit you should use the variant of bidding for turn order. It helps to remove the advantage of being the first player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Each player is given a mix of colored and neutral blocks, all identically shaped. Players take turns placing or stacking the blocks on a grid. After each turn, the inspector (a white pawn) walks 1-4 spaces (player's choice) around the Pueblo. If the row has colored blocks exposed, those players gain points. The higher the blocks, the more points are scored. After all the blocks have been placed, the inspector walks once around, stops on every square, and the points are piled on. At least half of the points are scored at the end of the game. Fewest points wins! Really pleasant game. Nothing too taxing on the brain.

**Update years later. Played again and what before was "pleasant", I now find dull. Either games have evolved enough for me to have higher expectations or I have changed. Either way, I found the puzzle tedious and the endgame interminable. I can't imagine adding the auctions and making this game even longer. Time to sell!

Owned for a long time and sold unplayed. After finally playing Pueblo, I have no seller's regret. It is a decent multiplayer abstract with good haptics. Finding a spot to hide your building elements from the view of the chieftain poses an interesting puzzle each turn. There's simply nothing else that makes me want to revisit it. Also, with four players, the last player suffers heavily from a positional disadvantage and probably won't have any chance to win with competent opponents. Three players purportedly works better. The advanced rules admit this weakness and offer a turn order auction variant for experienced players.

A little bit like a more complex version of Rumis/Blokus 3D with an emphasis on watching what other players do. Scoring is unorthodox. One or two people I've played this with didn't particularly like it but, generally, people have had lukewarm to good experiences with it. No one has been wildly passionate about it either, though. That being said I'm always up for a good game of Pueblo. 3 players seems to be optimal for this game. 

This game can be a bruiser because the key to winning is in the "listen to the notes that aren't being played"; because scoring is punitive most choices are more about building least-worst scenarios than they are about building good solutions.  

Good luck finding it these days, though - it's very out-of-print and probably never coming back into print.

I played Pueblo back in 2002 when it was new, and didn't really like it.  At the time I was not too enticed by abstract games, and Pueblo felt very abstract.

I have a soft spot for abstracts apparently, but this seems to be one of the best, and will likely rise in rating the more I play.  Interestingly, I played Rumis after Pueblo at BGG con, and was able to get a better feel for what I like about it.  Rumis seemed much more of a puzzle, than a game with strategy.  Pueblo was a puzzle that played like a strategy game, and had plenty of tense decisions and placement concerns to contemplate carefully.  Looking forward to continued plays, and also to using the pro rules for added flavor.

Pueblo has an original game mechanism, but also some serious drawbacks. First of all, you have to play the combination of building up and then breaking down to compensate for the advantage to the starting player (an other alternative is the bidding for the starting positions). Second, the game is very prone to kingmaking! Already a couple of games have been completely ruined due to players sparing eachother when moving the chieftain. This spoils the fun ... at least if you want to bother thinking how to build your pieces. Of course, 2-player games don't have these side-effects and can be very enjoying and intellectually engaging. My rating for 2 players would be 7. Somehow, I became Belgian Champion in 2003 (Multijeux).

If you see the game you know where the comparisons with Rumis (blokus3D) are coming from. However I thought this game played completely different.

This is the Euro-gamer's abstract. Fun thinking game. The moving architect allows for you to flub on one block in order to correct another block. Overall a more forgiving if not deeper abstract as you have time to prepare but also must think multiple turns in advance. Not too fond of the end game variation of deconstruction, however, as it can throw a score completely off. It turns the game more into a round of Majahng (sp?) and removes much of the 'thinking ahead' element.

Similar game to Rumis or Blokus 3D. However I prefer this version. 

Pueblo - the ultimate building challenge! Work with the other players to create a mighty home for the Chieftain, stone by stone. You are a craftsman, but you cannot let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalized. The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes! Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.

I was very disappointed in my only play of Pueblo as it appeared that the major complaint about the game did indeed manifest itself in the game.  The first player easily won the game.  I appreciate the concept behind the game, but it did not play out very well.  Basically, you are seeking to score the least points in the game and you score the row based on increasing increments of 1 as you go up the tower/pueblo that the chief is facing.  If the chief lands on a corner spot, you look at the top of the tower and score 1 point for each color that shows in that quadrant on the top of the tower.

Quite an ok game for us. Don't like the "highest mark=loser".But, I find it quite relaxing while playing this game. Not much brain-burning, just putting the blocks, and move the chieftan to penalize other players. Haven't tried the Pro rules yet.

Nice chunky playing pieces, it's lovely to see the building grow in front of you. Because they are all the same shape, though, you sometimes feel that you don't have a lot of choices. We're not sure if the final scoring round is really needed either - it feels like the game should just end after the last piece has been played.

All in all, a fun game to play!

Original game mechanic.  Right-brain, with spatial awareness and a constant struggle to minimize damage to oneself by thinking ahead.  What I don't like so much about this game is the fact that often you have to decide which player you will penalize (rather than using victory points, the player least dinged wins).  Still, an interesting change of pace from one of my favorite game designers.

Great 3D building game. Try to hide your bricks from the observer and score as little penalty points as possible. Bacause of the shape of the bricks, this can be a hard puzzle. Great game for everyone, because it is so different from any other game and it has simple rules, and is a challenge to anyone to win.

Faék egyszerű szabályok, hat deka taktika, mindez leöntve három deci absztrakcióval és kész a Pueblo.

A játék megjelenése nem egy letisztult csodaszépség, de absztrakt játéknak teljesen elfogadható.

Ötletes a pontozás során, hogy nem győzelmi, hanem büntető pontokat gyűjtünk, így az nyer, akinek a legkevesebb van a végén.

Ketten próbáltuk, hármasban vagy négyesben valószínűleg kicsit kaotikusabb lehet. (Két játékosnál jobban kiszámítható, hogy a másik hová lép a törzsfőnökkel.)

Abstract game where you place pieces in a building and advance the chief token around the board. For colored blocks visible from that site, points of shame are awarded (bad) to the players' of their respective colors. After all blocks are in, all spaces are counted again and the player with the fewest points wins.

Sounds like a pretty solid game, but I'm not sure how interesting I'd find it.

We have Rumis, after all.

A player has 3 colored blocks. Each block is made up of two pieces ("L" shaped pieces put together): one in their own color, and one of the neutral white color. Players play a half block onto the board and move the cheftian 1 to 4 spaces. The cheftain then penalizes players for colors that it can see, including upper level colors, which cost more points. Once everyone has placed their last block, the cheftain does one final walkaround penalizing everyone for points. Pretty fun game after one playing.

Extremely unique multiplayer abstract game that makes full use of its 3d tokens. The scoring mechanism, in which players struggle to hide their own pieces, makes the game feel like nothing else out there.

Don't care if I ever play it again.  Far too much kingmaking for me.  The Chieftain piece should be moved by a random number, not at the whim of other players.  One player always gets picked on, and the net result is an uneven game since there is only one dimension to the scoring.

Fantastic Kramer and Kiesling abstract game. At the start of the game you get an assortment of blocks. Half are in your color, half are neutral colored. You place the blocks on the structure and then move the pawn that walks around the board 1-4 spaces. On the space he stops he looks at the board and assigns negative points to whatever player color blocks he sees. It's a super fun and super punishing game that everyone I've tried it with has it enjoyed. 

After my 8th play I did start to feel like I've seen all the different types of board states the game can offer.

I think a lot of what makes this game enjoyable is that there is almost never a "good" place to play.  Instead, you're just looking for the spot that minimizes your pain.  Funny thing, the player before you almost always takes exactly the spot you wanted!  Argh!

After 1 play (which I won by quite a margin, surprising everyone playing, me not least, since I expected to lose): It's an ok game, perhaps I'd like it better with the optional rules.  I would definitely like it better if you got a set of pieces of various shapes (I'm thinking Blokus here), instead of all the same.  Extremely thin 'theme' and very little variability.  No, not a bad game, and I'd play it again, but it's not one I'd leap to play again.

pueblo is a pretty unique game that forces players to exercise a completely different part of their brain that most other games do. i'm surprised by how much fun this game actually is despite its abstract and analytical nature. trying to figure out where to put the blocks and where to move the chieftain is a lot of fun and actually requires that you stand up and get a good view of the structure. i also enjoy the amount of playful table talk that this game encourages-it can be a lot of fun to try and persuade players where they should put their next piece (that is if you play with players who don't mind that kind of thing or otherwise wouldn't take it personally).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My main concern with this game is downtime. If somebody is not so good at 3d visualisation and needs to test evry possible (and unpossible) placement of its tile, the game really bogs down. And since you cannot really plan your move ahead, you simply sit there waiting for ages.

Ironic that my favourite game is a KK design (El Grande), but this, by the same designers, almost ranks as the worst euro I've ever played. Man, I loathed it. Like Torres, interest well and truly waned about mid-way. By the end I had violent pangs of boredom. Gimmicky abstract mechanics, tacked on optional rules...it made me feel like I was trapped in a game of Tetris.

Yes, I will concede that many people will love turning that little board, their eager faces counting the rows and columns as they mentally place their cubes. But I'm with Adrian Mole on this one. Sure, St Pancaras Sation is one of the largest unsupported arch structures in the whole world. But is it beautiful? "Quite honestly, all I can see is dirty, scruffy roof covered in pigeon sh--". I'd make a poor architect.

Pueblo - the ultimate building challenge! Work with the other players to create a mighty home for the Chieftain, stone by stone. You are a craftsman but you can not let the Chieftain see your trademark stones, or you will be penalised. The longer you play, the more difficult this task becomes! Take on your opponents and become the Chieftain's Master Builder.

The theme setting is the Native American Pueblos of the Southwest tribes of the Zuni and Hopi. The board is a fairly small square. Each player get a number of building blocks in their own color, and also some neutral colored blocks (1 less than the colored). Starting with the odd colored block, the player places it on the board, and then gets to move the "Chieftain" around the outer track surrounding the board. If the Chieftain can look straight across and see any colored blocks, those players gain points -- but points are bad. And when the Chieftain lands on the corners of the track, he looks down on the Pueblo from above, and all visible player's blocks gain them more points. Now, on each subsequent pair of turns, you have a choice of a colored block and a neutral block. Once all players' blocks are played, the Chieftain makes one last trip around the board, players gaining points all along the way. The player who has gained the least points is the Master Builder and the winner of the game.

I rate it lower even though kids/adults love the pieces, because I get bogged down with making the best move.  Recommended.

Players each possess 3D pieces that represent half of a 2x2 cube. Some of these are in their colors, while the rest are in a neutral tan color. On your turn you must place one piece, leaving no overhang, on an 8x8 grid, eventually building upwards and combining with pieces belonging to other players. You must then move the cheiftan 1-4 spaces around the perimeter of the board. He looks straight down his line of vision, awarding negative points for each block of color he sees, to the player owning that color. The higher up a visible block is, the worse (3rd level is -3 points, for example). At game end, the chieftan walks the full perimeter, scoring each line of sight. A game unlike any other, with a goal of negative area control, simple rules, and no luck.

(+) Very original title with unique mechanics
(+) It is much fun to see the building growing bigger in 3D
(+) Some real opportunities for tactical play as you try to assess where your opponents will build and where they will stop the white pawn
(+) Does not outstay its welcome with a playtime of less than 60 minutes
(+) Quick to set up and easy to explain
(+) Tension builds up as the game progresses as building higher increases potential penalties

(-) Some 'king maker' effects, mainly in the 'demolition' variant.

Approx game time: 10 - 20 min/player, depending on if the 'demolition' variant is played or not.

It's fun to think in 3-D.  Simple as that.  The game has problems with bashing the leader, and strategically, there is very little to think about.  But despite its deficiencies as a competitive game, no other game let's me think like this.  Light and breezy.

This game plays differently depending on the number of players. A 2-player game feels like a simple, abstract game of chess. A 3 or 4 player game is more fun - and more frustrating. I definitely like playing the game and it has the benefit of being easy to learn.

This is a really ingenious game. Very easy to learn and play but with hard decisions while playing. I had a three player game and it seemed to be the sweet spot. Of course an abstract design. But a unique feeling while spinning the gameboard in order to check the chieftain's line of sight. For me: a surprisingly good game!

RATING: 8
Players add three dimensional pieces to the board, building a pueblo. Each player has two colors. One is neutral, and this is what the foreman wants to see. The other has your personal mark on it, your flourish, and if the foreman sees this you will be penalized, so you want to hide these pieces from foreman. The foreman follows a track around the board, and after someone places a piece s/he moves the foreman 1-4 spaces. The foreman then identifies - in a straight line - if he can see any squares with a personal mark. If so, that player is penalized 1 point times the story. That is, if the pieces is on the 2nd floor, you're penalized two points. The foreman also does a special overhead view of a quarter of the board when he lands on a corner, assessing 1 point for each personal square observed. After all pieces have been placed, the foreman does a final lap around the board. Low score obviously wins.

This game has a great look to it as you build a colorful three-dimensional pueblo. Watch out for a screw-up in the English translation of the rules. The bottom of the piece you place must have all three squares RESTING on the board or other pieces - there can be no overhanging. The English rules do not make this clear, but the French does.

RATING: 7
I've used this Kramer & Kiesling classic as an introductory game on several occasions and, so far, it's gone over well each time. It has chunky, colourful, 3D plastic Tetris-like blocks (similar to Rumis) so it's attractive and people get a sense of comfort out of seeing something similar to a thing they already know. It has a puzzle-like nature that many people enjoy and find familiar. But it also has a little bit of "screw your neighbour" interaction working to satisfy players' darker impulses. The rules are simple and the play-time is not overly long. The only real downside to the game, from my perspective, is the busy and slightly confusing scoring track that winds back and forth in an Etch-a-Sketch spiral. Other than that, it's a really good game.

I finally got my wife to play this.  While we both enjoyed the game, I liked it a whole lot more than she did.  She is not nearly as adept at the 3-D visulization needed in this game.  At any rate, it is another building game, albeit much more abstract in nature than most.  Placement is very tactical as is the movement of the chief, particularly if you are trying to set your opponent up.  Be careful with the pieces -- there are a lot of times that it looks like they should work in a spot, but they really won't.

Fantastic building game with tension and fun throughout. Turn order is crucial, so the pro rules are a must. I'm impressed with the somewhat plausible theme given to this "abstract." Putting the board on a lazy susan makes the game run a lot smoother.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Finally, an abstract game with some semblance of a theme (and it works!). Each player has a set of blocks that they use to build a pueblo: the catch? 

Their chief is patrolling the perimeter of the board and players with their colour exposed to his line of sight get negative points.

Very fun and players will be walking all around the board, standing up and moving from side to side in an attempt to best position their pieces.

Again, like these sort of games, players with a good sense of geometry and perspective will do well.

Word!  This game makes me feel spacial.  I love Torres, and this fits in nicely with Kramers experiments with the third dimension.  Lovely pieces, and a simple but nifty idea make the game a piece to discuss as it is being built.  It is funny, this is a game that while being cutthroat in the scoring, is strangely cooperative in the building stage.  I like it.

A good 3-D abstract game; one of our earlier purchases, but it's been a LONG time since we've played it.

Players take turns placing a building piece on the board. The tribe chief walks along a path around the building area, and scores for whichever player's colors he sees. Periodically there's also scoring based on colors visible looking down from above. So you have to place tiles carefully to show token faces both on the side and from above.

Haven't played in a long time -- Rumis is similar but simpler, and plays more quickly.

RATING: 7.5
Like any good abstract strategy game (except perhaps chess), this one is brilliant in its simplicity.  After playing it for the first time, I decided to purchase it, only to discover that it was out of print.  (Not long afterwards I was fortunate enough to stumble upon a copy of it at a brick-and-mortar store.)    I don't just enjoy this because I'm good at it (I seem to have an uncanny skill with 3-D spacial orientation), but I really do think it's a fun, scalable game for 2 to 4 players, and the optional rules only enhance the play experience.  My only complaint with the design is that they could have made both the playing surface and the score board smaller and fit the whole thing into a box half the size.  I'm also curious to know how Rumis compares, since that one incorporates different-shaped playing pieces and boards.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7.5/10

[RGG 2002 edition] {Builder, abstract; spatial, bidding, variable-player-order} {Basic rule 7, Demolish rule (with cult site) 7.5, Pro rule (with cult site) 7.5, Pro Demolish rule 7} Pueblo is a decent and unique spatial abstract game with a somewhat thin theme. It's a very good candidate for students to learn strategy games.

The color of the blocks is quite dull (I like the color tune of Rumis much more). The artwork of Pueblo is quite stylish, though.

Pueblo is not very accessible - many friends don't like it because it's quite brain-teasing, abstract and has long down time. However, I think it's another Kramer-Kiesling winner because it's is so special and really provides players with strategic and tactical options throughout the game.

I have played both Rumis and Pueblo. Rumis is a more accessible game and is more suitable for general players. Pueblo is a meatier game that needs deeper planning and more concentration. Until a very clever board is created for Rumis that needs deeper strategy, I prefer Pueblo.

I have been wondering what I would think of this game compared to Rumis.  I hear all kinds of different opinions, but Rumis is faster and simpler.  This is a little deeper, but I'm not sure the additional depth is proportional to the additional work.  My biggest problem with the game is probably that so much of the score occurs after the game is effectively over.  I almost wonder how significant the scoring during the placement phase is.

Still, after it is all said and done, I did like the game.  My comments above sound worse than they are because I like Rumis better.  Considering Pueblo on its own, it is still a good game.  The scoring during construction isn't really insigificant and the end of game scoring is not haphazzard.  The final scoring might even help balance the scoring during construction, but I have only played once, so it's hard to say.

An abstract that's clever, but somewhat silly.  The theme here is paper thin, befitting an abstract.  The game works, but it's very mathematical.

Still suffers from the dryness that plagues their other titles.

I do not generally excel at or enjoy spatial games but this one has just the right amount of challenge, as long as the other players are patient. It reminds me of Jenga. I had a great time playing, won my first game (WOOHOO), and acknowledge that this is for sure a good game. But it's really painful on my brain. Like, physically painful. So it needs to be sandwiched with something super light, and I will only play it depending on my mood. Looking to unwind, relax, or have a ball, this is not the right game. Wanting mental stimulation, this hits the spot.

While this one and Rumis are often compared, I like this one better because it requires more strategy, of which I have none, but it's still a great game.  

In a 2 player, we find that placing your blocks as low as possible, even out to the last parts of the grid, works best.  Your blocks may still be visible, but taking a lot of little 1 and 2 point hits doesn't hurt as much as building high and being unable to cover the 3, 4, or 5 point hits.  Those especially hurt when the chieftan goes around the pueblo one last time.

Played several times. An interesting geometric game, whose pieces surprisingly seem to have the wrong orientation most of the time (but that is part of the charm of the game). There can be some downtime due to analysis-paralysis (and possibly some king-making issues). I have not played with the sacred sites variant but will probably try it next time.

I appreciate this game very much.  It is visually appealing and makes one think and plan ahead.  The only building game I've ever played, and I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to try one out.

Quirky Pentimino based game where you are trying to reduce the amount of exposed face of your colored shapes.

by my favorite designers.  i havent played it that many times, and although it seems fun, the strategy seems pretty obvious (build as close to the center as you can, behind the wandering chieftan).

The more I play Pueblo, the more I love the game. Very simple rules, very engaging gameplay. There are tough decisions, diminishing playing space and risk management... Aside from very nice components, the game scales incredibly well -- just as wonderful for 2 as it is for 3 or 4!

Like at least a couple other people, I originally rated this game better but have dropped my score.   I feel like the basic game (without deconstruction, bidding, or sacred spaces) lacks depth after a while.  It&#039;s not that the game&#039;s not challenging, but the height mechanic is too punishing.  If you want to win the game, then for starters: do NOT allow any of your coloured pieces hit level 3.  The way the board fills up also seems to give a distinct advantage to whoever goes first because the later in the game a coloured piece is played, the more likely it will score a greater penalty for you.  Perhaps if I tried the play variations I&#039;d like it more, but it&#039;s not holding my interest too well.

The pieces for Pueblo are undeniably cool and its pretty interesting building with them... but something about dropping the builder on someone for points and the long point counting after all that staring at the pile of blocks and considering moves just left me a little cold.  Perhaps I'd enjoy it more if I wasn't tired at the end of a Convention so I'd like to give it another try... but I expect this just isn't the spatial abstract for me.

A gorgeous game to look at, with a high LEGO [TM] factor. Rules are simple, but choices are tough. There is no luck and only a bit of player interaction. Good blend of tactics and strategy, as you not only have to optimize your points for the current round, but also have to think about how you will do in the last, huge scoring round.

Like the game the first few times I played, but lately have started to like it less and less.

A tricky game of obscuring your "bricks" while providing only nastily exposed places for your opponents to build.  The solid "bricks" are very satisfying to handle, and though the contemplations each player makes on where to place their bricks sometimes slow the game a little much, it still moves sufficiently quickly and viciously to keep me engaged.

A lazy-susan would come in very handy for this game! It's a bit of a brain-burner too, but it's nothing a little bit of goading from other players can't overcome. It's a lot more interesting playing with the "cult spaces". They can vary the difficulty by quite a bit depending on how they are deployed and how many are used. I kept thinking about Mesa Verde the whole time too, hmmm.

Seems like the colors are too bright for the desert theme. Should be tan, cream, dark orange, dark red, etc.

I give a 8 for the 2-player game, but it goes down to a 6 with 4 players. I can’t see why one should try to take the lead (low penalty points), because it’s too easy for others to hit the leader. It becomes more a political game than a reflexion game. I thought about using numbered chips as penalty points instead of the scoring track. This way, scores would be kept hidden (like in Durch die Wüste) until the final scoring. Maybe it could improve the game… or bring more chaos? I don’t know how things are going in a 3-player game since I’ve never played with that number, but I guess it should play better than 4.

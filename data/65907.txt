Honestly I almost didn't buy this because it had a train on it (and I hate train games), but I liked it more than Mystery of The Abby. I love how the cards keep moving so that you need to see 2 of them before you can dismiss it.

A beautiful game from Days of Wonder. Just opening the box makes us smile. The theme/setting is perfect for a game like this, and simple mechanics really feel like a nice fit to the theme.

Played this 2-3 times.  Ended up giving it away because it was never going to be played at my home.  My wife hated the little clock minigame to determine the time of the murder.  Oh well, Mystery of the Abbey was a miss too.  Possibly my wife doesn't like deduction games...

RATING: 7
Tried this game with 3 players - it was pretty fun as we role played through it. However, the time of the crime element was terrible for us as we dislike memory mechanics in games, so we'll be skipping that step next time. Otherwise, the game has a great, high quality look - very reminiscent of Clue, only better since you don't have to waste time moving from room to room to collect clues. The only other minor quip is that the worksheets should have the cities printed on it, instead of suggesting to write them down in one of the examples. Played this with 4 players - it was very chaotic and hard to figure out whodunit as everyone tracked what they saw from whom and who they showed what. 2015 UPDATE: Changed my mind about this one and put it into the keeper category. The reason being is that I remember this being a more fun version of Clue, which was a childhood favorite for me.

RATING: 6
A more involved Clue.  There are two cards of each type floating around instead of one, and they switch between play areas constantly, so you'll really have to make an effort to track down both copies at the same time to eliminate something from your list. There are different train cars with different actions available to reveal cards and move cards around, of which you'll take a few each turn.

There are four separate types of clues (Suspect, Location, Motive, M.O.), which are identical, plus a fifth (Time), which operates in a completely different way, but not in a good way: it feels tacked-on, taking place at stages of the game specifically set aside for the Time, using a mechanic that is not seen elsewhere in the game, and basically amounts to a trio of speed-memorization contests.

Another frustrating feature of this game is that it seems to be set up so that you don't solve the mystery by the end.  You have a limited amount of actions available, and a competent set of opponents will be able to prevent you from learning too much too quickly (this probably changes with # of players, my experience is based on 5 players).  Not some sort of objective flaw, but I find it frustrating for the curtain to come down when I'm still trying to work things out (thematically, it's especially annoying to know where, when, how, and why the murder occurred, but not whodunit!).

It's got more going on than Clue, with some good card-manipulation ideas, but it's not as good at the same basic idea as Mystery at the Abbey.

Generally, it was exactly what I was expecting it to be - a Deduction game that was interesting and entertaining, with a solid set of rules.
Unfortunately, I've only been able to play once so far, and I hesitate to give it a higher or lower rating on that.  What I can go by is that all 4 people playing agreed that it was a blast to play.

Time is assuredly the weakest mechanic.  It's very, very easy to figure it out for anyone with a plan, so it may as well turn into a triviality after a few games.  But it's mainly there for the flavor and we all know it.

Regardless of this, production quality is as high as ever for DoW.  I really don't know how this has so many people complaining - it's really solid.  Our first game took less than 3 hours, and I have no idea how further games could take more than 2.  Seems entirely reasonable to me for what you're playing.

"Clue on crack" as one fellow player described it. Does suffer from the RftG problem of icons that are impossible to decipher, until somebody tells you what they mean, in which case it's blindingly obvious. It will be slow going at first, but as people pick it will go faster.

The components are great, but still, I wonder if it's worth the price given that cheaper alternatives like Sleuth exist.

The components are quite nice. It does a decent job of capturing the theme. The game is comparable to Clue, but better and less random. There is a bit of a learning curve as the various actions of the different passenger cars take a while to memorize. So, the first game or two will take much longer than it should. The rule book could have been a bet clearer on some things as well. A good deduction game that the wife loves.

For a Clue-style game, we like this more than Mystery of the Abbey. Very much a family style game since someone can win by getting some lucky guesses at the end, but this is fine with us. The theme is great, components are very nice too. We actually like the time component of the game. My rating is a little higher than it might normally be because of how much my wife and mom like the game. Makes it more fun to play when the people you're playing with are really having a great time.

Fun, fun, fun!!! DOW does it agian! A beautifully produced deduction game that I taught to my GF (not a super serious game player) and her 2 friends (not gamers at all) and we had no problem understanding anything. One of the players complained that the Time mechanic was like a different game and didn't reward deduction as well. While I agree with that, I think that the Time cards add another dimension to the game (quick thinking and pattern recognition) that recognizes all around good play. Besides, I have thr trick to figuring out the Time cards, but I'm not telling here! This isn't going to replace MOTA for being my favorite game just yet, but it's a good one.

With a little bit a tweaking I think it's a better deduction game than mystery of the abbey. I really enjoy these games during the whole process, but find myself disappointed if the winner played a worse game but got some lucky guesses. Unlike mystery of the abbey everyone gets a shot so it mitigates the problem of people racing to make a 1/5 guess to steal the win. Also very nice looking game!

This was interesting, but in the end it still seemed like a very complicated shell game.  If you have a photographic memory, I could see this being a fun struggle to take the right actions to yield new information that you don't yet have.  But in the end for me it was pretty confusing and a little frustrating.  I think it was better playing with only 3 players rather than all 5 however.

Interesting, but not sure how much I like it.  In one play of almost randomly choosing locations to visit, I was able to correctly identify / guess all of the information.

I don't really like this kind of game. This one went on way too long, at least double what it should have. The people I played with were fun, if it weren't for them I might have run away screaming. But, I did still have fun. And if it went more quickly somehow, I could see myself being dragged back to the table. Perhaps a timer, set to 10 seconds to make a turn.

I actually liked it better than I thought I would.  The challenge in the game (eliminating as many options as you can in a single round) is quite fun.  Only problem is its a long game, and if it's not played straight (cards are not discarded when they should be) it could all be a total waste.

My current favorite "whodunit"; this is a thinking man's version of Clue. Luck is minimized (no die roll factor), and more tracking and attention required than in Clue (or its variants). I also love Mystery of the Abbey, but it is admittedly easier for a person to throw things off with an (inadvertant) misleading answer in Mystery of the Abbey, so that is why I rate this one slightly higher; that does not happen in Mystery Express.

This is an interesting game because there is no obvious way to play on the surface after one game. By the end we all had about the same information, and most of us had things narrowed down to 2 choices (or 3) in most categories. It then came down to who guessed right. Jonathan and Steve amazingly got most or all of them right taking the tie, while Ryan and I guessed poorly. The funny part was that I had more right in the telegram round than I did in the final round, because some of my 50/50 guesses flipped.

I'm very curious as to whether there are more efficient ways to play, and ways to get more information than what each of us did this first game. I feel like there almost has to be some tactics that could be used to give an edge at the end.

The time of death mechanic was fun, and added a little more character to the game.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this and although it's not a straight deduction game, the approach to playing it is not obvious. I would certainly like to play it again, and rate this tentatively a 7. This rating will either drop or rise if we determine that the game is actually fairly shallow and it is impossible for players to gain more information that competitors, resulting in a "who guesses the 50/50 guesses right" finish to all games.

RATING: 4
I loooove deduction games, so I couldn’t wait to try this Cluedo-like game from Days of Wonders with family members, who also love games like Sleuth etc. However, it bombed big time and I’m so disappointed! The reason is probably partly due to the fact that the rules are more complex than any other deduction game I’ve introduced them to. But the main reason is the way the cards move around during the game, meaning that you very rarely can actually deduce something unless you’re counting the cards or something like that. Of course, you have a vague idea about where some of the cards are, but they are shifted around the board and taken back during the next round and such, making it hard to keep track of them. You can only be 100 % certain if you see two of the same cards during the same turn. Finally, the fact that we were 5 totally new players was a bad idea – next time I’m definitely only playing with 3, making it easier to deduce and cause less downtime. 

The way the time of the crime is handled is a neat idea and makes the game more interesting. Sure, people with better memories will have an easier time, but it’s a good idea imo. The different actions were a bit confusing for the first couple of rounds but got better. I’m not sure that it’s a good sign that you are rarely able to deduce everything in a deduction game, meaning the game could often end in a tie-breaker where people have only guessed 3 or maybe 4 facts out of 5… That did kind of suck. I’m gradually losing faith in finding more great deduction games, although Deduce or Die should be right up my alley.

I liked Clue when I was a kid but it always felt like homework, all story problems and logic puzzles.  The kind that were all about how Alan, Betty and Clare had an apple, a banana and a cigarillo but Betty didn't like fruit with seeds and Clare was color blind, which meant...

Mystery Express takes the basic game of Clue and adds an abundance of fiddly baroque features, apparently designed to add depth but really only succeeds in adding confusion to the mix.  In Clue, you had one way to find information about three categories of information.  In ME, we're up to five categories, four of which can be discovered in several different ways while the other relies on yet another series of memory games.

All of which is compounded by the fact that the game actually has two endings, one after the other, like the Lord of the Rings movies.

This is a game for other people.  I can sense the strategy and the reason behind most of the changes, but I simply can't be bothered to play it again.

RATING: 6
Two things I'm pretty confident about. It's more complex than Mystery of the Abbey. It's also better. There's still the swapping of cards, but it feels less chaotic. Things like guessing the bag in the hand and the flipping of time cards may strike some as "gimicky," but I don't mind them. The core of the game is pretty cool, with two cards per crime item, and the separate player hand and discard piles. I need to play this some more.

Update: two more plays and it's still a solid 8. I don't think the rating will go any higher, but at the same time, I'm not sure how anyone could make a better deduction game with the "missing card" idea at work. There's less chaos than Mystery of the Abbey, but there's still enough messing around with cards that it requires some luck to nail down the murder traits. Then again, our good friend has won both recent games, so maybe there's less luck than I think!

Update: after watching this sit on the shelf unplayed, I finally got it to the table. Ultimately, I think I've concluded this is a good game, but one I don't need to own. Why? It's a little too complex for nongamers, and it's outside the comfort zone of "serious" gamers. The games I've played seemed to have taken just a little too long. And, my wife's ambivalent feelings toward the game ultimately meant this became trade fodder.

Pretty cool game, where you should find out who is the murderer, motive, location and what the murder weapon was (and also what time the murder happen.)

I've only played this game once so far and I bought this almost a year ago. The one time I played it I felt like there was no clear way to get a look at all of the cards, and by the end of the game the person who won only managed to deduce a few of the answers (some of which was by guessing). I feel like if this was a strong deduction game, the winner should know all or most of the answers or at the very least have a very strong feeling of it.

I want to play it more to make up my mind on it (it may turn out to be much better with more plays) but I never end up suggesting we play it because friends enjoy other games more than this one.

Just like Clue, but different. :D  
This one is more FUN!  Like "Clue Sr." or "Advanced Clue".  Initial Rating 7.

This game takes the Who, What and Where of traditional Clue and adds the Why and When (Motive and Time).  Plus, there are two of each card, so you have to know where both are in order to eliminate that suspect/item/etc.  It can be tough because you must keep track of cards that you give away and where they are moving to among your opponents.  The yellow character's special power is too powerful and unbalanced compared to he rest.  (But I give that role to my daughter, so it's cool.)  Fun and challenging.  Upgraded rating to a 7.5.  It would be an 8, but I don't "always" want to play it.  I only want to play it with 3 players, otherwise it slows down too much.  The downside of 3 player is that 2 items of each card type are removed from the game.

RATING: 7.5
This is a significant step up from Clue both in terms of complexity and player choices.  Rather than 3 elements of the mystery, players must deduce 5.  There is a pair of cards for every item, so the challenge is to see both in the same turn to rule it out completely.

The actions in your turn often have the chance to benefit other players, which adds a little more thought to strategy on top of the logic required.  What is a challenge is that no player is likely to narrow down every element completely - so educated guesswork is important.

The components are flawless (typical for a Days of Wonder release) and of course there is tremendous replay value.  My main complaint is the Time element - it's a silly throwaway and only a fool can't figure that one out.  I'll give it one more try, but am leaning towards leaving it out of the game completely.

RATING: 7
Production: Beautiful components. The details on the train board are exquisite. The player pawns are fun. There are some usability problems with the cards, and a bit of trouble keeping track of how many hours a player has spent during their turn.

Play: Very clever. I thought the duplication of crime cards (contrasted to others in this genre) would have made for a much harder game, but this is not the case. Nearly half the actions a player can take on their turn will benefit at least one other player as well. More than other similar games it is imperative to keep track of which cards I've shown to other players, or received from other players, so that I might try to show the same card to them again. I like that cards are discarded face-down throughout the game turn. Those time cards are incredibly tricky, and so far have contributed to my defeat. (3+1+3) (1 play)

This game fixes everything that is wrong with Clue:
-Everyone gets to guess at the solution.
-No one can accidentally cheat, because you ask for cards by color and you can see the color of the back each card.
-The killer isn't one of the players, so you don't need an "amnesia" excuse. You have to catch the killer before the train gets to the end of the line and the killer escapes.
The components are excellent, and the theme is wonderfully executed. You feel like you really are amateur sleuths aboard the Orient Express, trying to solve as much of the mystery as you can before time runs out.
The game does take several hours to play and requires the players to pay close attention to what is going on, so it is best for people who enjoy thinking games.

My god this is tedious. I realize it takes a while to learn a game sometimes, but the first turn alone took an hour. All the while we were looking at each other saying, "Wow, this game really sucks!"
It's Clue with whatever minimal fun that game had sucked out of it with boring complexity. 

Here's some only slightly exaggerated examples of gameplay:
Take a card from the person on your left (or right), look at it but don't show it to everyone (or maybe you should in this train car?), give it to person on your right (or left), repeat ad nauseum. 
Take one card from each player from the same category (or is it different categories in this car?) and after looking at them, put them in your discard pile (or is it back in your hand, or maybe it's back in their hand, lemme check the rules for the fifth time).
Now throw this deck of cards on the floor and figure out which one is missing like Rainman.
Friggin ridiculous.

Players board the famous Orient Express in Paris just as a murder occurs. The rest of the trip is consumed with determining the who, what, when, where, and why of the crime. This game explores the more analytical side of the "whodunit" genre, rewarding a logical and more precise approach to solving the crime. The player who correctly identifies the most elements of the crime by the time the train reaches Istanbul wins the game.

An interesting take on the whole Clue-style whodunit type of game.  Not too much different.  Yeah, there are different mechanics, and the whole idea of the time constraint is cool, but it's still essentially Col. Mustard in the Train with the Revolver.  However, I really like the addition of the Motive and Time elements, and the cool way of trying to figure out the Time.  This is an enjoyable game, that I'm sure will go faster now that we know the rules better.  Overall, not the best or most fun game out there, but it still makes for an enjoyable evening.  A great family game for those with older kids.  Worth more than just one play.  

Warning - DO NOT play this with anyone who has even a hint of AP, or you'll be there all night!

I have only played this once and it was late at night.

It took a while to figure remember all of the different actions, because they are all similar, and yet slightly different.  Since it was late, it was difficult to figure out when to use the various actions.  This lead to quite a bit of AP for the first few rounds.  We had fun with the theme, and enjoyed the game, but we were definitely over-whelmed.  One of the players was recording EVERYTHING.  Meaning, not only who had which card, but who he had shown each of his cards to.  Since there is so much going on, he made mistakes, and didn't end up winning, but it slowed the game a bit.

There is quite a bit of shifting around of cards, which, for a deduction game, makes it a bit chaotic in some of your deductions.  But this is obviously the intended purpose, which I liked.  This means you'll have to make some likely guesses at the end.  It also means that some people will get lucky and some people will get unlucky.

Overall, I liked the game.  As usual, the production is very good.  I think I would enjoy the game more with repeated plays.

RATING: 7
A Clue like game where you try to deduce whodunit.  In Clue you are trying for who, where, an how.  In MysteryExpress, you are deducing who, where, how, why, and when. These are 5 cards pulled out of the deck. You are dealt cards which help to rule out (like in Clue).  And you take various type actions to see other cards.  The rub is that there are 2 of each card.  So seeing a card doesn't necessarily rule it out.  And in each round, cards are passed to various players.  So there's some uncertainty like Mystery of the Abbey...but it's more controlled.

I liked it.  Probably one of the better deduction games.  I think I'd request it over most of the other deduction games I've played.  Still, I own Sleuth already, so I'm not real eager to buy this.

RATING: 5
A murder has been committed on a train, and players are trying to deduce who, why, when, how and where the murder was committed.  Game is set up in Cluedo fashion, with one card from various decks being hidden away - these need to be solved.  Game play departs from Cluedo, as players spend their "hours" on the train visiting cars and performing actions, mainly trying to extract information from the other players.  The trick here is there are two of every card, so you're trying to see two of a kind in a turn to eliminate it from the running.  Clever idea, and the game mechanics work well (although the "Bag" car seems a bit extraneous).  Players telegram their "guesses" in one turn from the end, which will be used as a tie breaker.  Game ends after five rounds, most correct deductions/guesses wins.  Game was fun, but the main issue was the two hour plus playing time - if every game takes that long, it will get old fast.  Production is top notch, apart from the chipped playing figures.  The clock deck is hilarious - it's basically a sure thing once you "get it".  Fun game, just too long.

Lovely theme. a murder on the orient express.. lets investigate who done it, why, how, where and at what time? the game presents the train along 6 main stops (rounds) every stop brings a special stage in the game and during rounds (while the train is on the way) you all have the chance to use the train locations and actions to have your investigation. the winner is the one that figures out all the details of the crime (or the closest one to the truth). It's fun, strategic, simple, beautiful and entertaining.

RATING: 7
[1 play] I was wary of this latest mystery/deduction game from Days of Wonder, remembering the disappointment we experienced with Mystery of the Abbey.  After playing once, though, my first impression is definitely positive.  The tragic flaw of MotA is that the card-passing undermines the stability of your deductions.  In Mystery Express, cards do move around, but in such a way that you can still make deductions--or at least, sometimes you can and sometimes you can't, but you know the difference.

The components are the usual deluxe DoW production.  Kudos to them for including a screen (the ticket wallet) for note-taking.  This doubles as a player aid, containing the list of train compartments and explanation of the possible action(s) to be taken in each one.  These two functions do interfere with each other slightly, but it's no big deal; when you're reading the aid, you can just put your notes sheet face down.  And once we're more familiar with the game, we won't need the player aid so much, but will still have the ticket wallet as a notes shield.  The only other quibble I have is with the suitcase piece, which some players found almost too large to comfortably/effectively conceal in one hand.  

We played with three players, for which you remove some of the possibilities in every category except time.  It seems like with more players, the game might be harder, because there are more possibilities, but the train trip isn't any longer.  I'm eager to try it with more, though, and see how it is.  

The one rule I would try hardest to impress upon a new player, because it seems to be most easily forgotten, but is of vital importance: Any card you receive goes into your discard stack, NOT your hand.  Any card you show goes into your discard stack, NOT back to your hand.  

I was surprised by how close a game we had and how successful we all were.  When we arrived in Istanbul, I had three elements known and successfully guessed the other two correct based on partial elimination.  I think we all had the five elements right, or maybe two of us had five and one had four; in any case, it was the telegram that decided the victory, and it was close there, too.  The winning player felt that the flaw of the game was that there was no way to end it early.  Unlike many other deduction games where you play until someone thinks they have the solution and is ready to attempt victory, here you play out the fixed time frame of the train trip.  So it's possible (though I don't know how frequently this would be likely to happen in practice) that you might have the game solved halfway through, correctly know everything, and have to sit there and play the rest of it out with nothing to do but maybe try to figure out ways to make it hard for others to learn anything.  This didn't seem like a big problem to me, since I didn’t even get the whole mystery solved, but I see her point.  

As usually happens in the first play of a deduction game, we all spent the whole game having a series of realizations about how we could improve our notation strategies.  I definitely think the different columns on the notes sheet should be the different cities/game rounds.  The instructions emphasize what you can see within the same round, but in fact, you can do a lot with the information that does carry over from round to round, if you're careful.  

I'm not crazy about the way the time element works.  I found the blank clocks really hard to recognize quickly, and the way it's run by the players means someone who has figured it out early can make it virtually impossible for anyone else to get any info when they do the time.

Every player has a special power; four of the five characters get extra opportunities to look at cards of the category that matches theirs.  (This will likely be more useful with more players in the game.)  The fifth character gets an extra hour's time on each leg of the voyage, and I'm inclined to think this is the strongest power.  

I'm looking forward to trying this game again.  I'm not ready to run out and buy a copy yet, but I definitely found it interesting, fun, and better than Mystery of the Abbey.

A deduction game sure to excite with engrossing theme and spectacular components. No rating yet since I've only played one 3 player game so far. It was a bit long but I'm sure that was due to us all being new to the game and stumbling through the mechanics. There is one small of the game I have a HUGE problem with: one of the possible motives for the killer is "Unknown." Seriously, the list of possible motives for the killer are Despair, Greed, Money, Jealousy, Rivalry, and UNKNOWN. How can you start the game not knowing what the motive is and successfully deduce the motive is literally unknown? Dumb.

This game did not disappoint. All the deduction elements I love from cleudo but with more of a gamers feel to it. Cards constantly changes hands and positions around the board and there are a variety of actions that can be taken.

Whilst you have the whole game to play around with who,what,why and where, the time deduction aspects are really quite clever with the whole deck being seen on only three occasions from which you must make your judgement, which leaves very little time to check and double check... sometimes you just have to go with your gut..... it also helps if you can actually tell the time :blush: although in my defense quarter past 6 and half past 4 do look very similar.

A complicated Cluedo. I find there is almost too much to keep track with four things to figure out by the end of the game. Time can easily be done once you learn the trick for tracking each way of revealing the time cards. The others are much harder. 

The few times I've played it the winner has been down to luck. We've all got time and maybe one other of the mystery components and it is the best guesser of the other two that wins the game.

A little more chaotic that I would have liked, but that could decrease with additional plays and a better understanding of how to manipulate the cards.  Feels like it runs longer than it should, and we were only 3 players.  I can't imagine playing this with 5.

Apparently I'm in the minority regarding the time card mechanisms because I liked that a lot.

Not a bad game, but I'd rather play Sleuth, even if the theme is much drier.

We enjoyed this game quite a bit, which is very encouraging considering some of the comments on here are so negative. I keep reading comments from people that this game takes too long. I don't know how anyone played a game for 3 hours... maybe they didn't read the rules beforehand or something? Our first 4-player game (after I reviewed the rules a couple times and did a one-man walkthrough at my house) from explanation through the final reveal took about an hour and a half, and a baby got it's diaper changed once in there too! Also, never play deduction games with my wife... I got this because she always wins at Clue and I figured somebody else might have a chance in this one, nope.

The only thing outstanding in it are the graphics and the pieces - they are simply breathtaking. So you can buy it and watch it all day long. There's not much else it can be used for.

Enjoyable. A little more difficult than Clue, and removes the random aspect of using dice to move from room to room. Not as "tight" as Sleuth, but fun when you want a little more theme and atmosphere. The time cards are an interesting aspect, and not as difficult to track as I first expected. - As a comparison, I didn't particularly like Mystery in the Abbey, but I enjoyed Mystery Express. Played a 2nd time with 4 (first time with 3), and rating holds. Game is more difficult with 4 than 3, but still enjoyable.

Might be missing the point of this one. Would be willing to play again to find out.
A deduction game where you have to be lucky to be able to deduce the right answer. Has the kiss of death combination for me-- lots of thinking combined with luck. One or the other please.
It seems like it would be too much trouble to track the card movements, but if you don't, and you haven't eliminated the options, you're just guessing. What's the point?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As usual with Days of Wonder games, the rulebook is beautiful but not very clear, so it took a few plays to understand that this game is not closed and compact like Clue and Agatha Christie. By the end of the game, nobody may actually know whodunnit. Once I realized that, I properly realized it was about trying to outrun by outwitting my fellow players more than actually solving the murder.

Better game than it's given credit for.

Still, I'm not sure it provides enough entertainment for the process it puts you through.

Ultimately, the game is about deduction and intuition. You have to make the call at the penultimate turn about which categories to guess in and which to not guess in (so as to not risk the loss of points) on the telegram phase.

Then, at the end, when you aren't penalized for guessing, you can either double down on your telegram guesses or try to hedge. Doubling down is the surest path to victory if you're right and the surest path to loss if you're wrong.

It's fun, and the game almost requires the two hours of shuffling and trading cards to get you to the point where you have enough data for your brain to make the subconscious leap to guess the right answers (at least in categories you haven't coldly deduced already), but it's not really the greatest return on investment for most people.

I like it, but not enough to keep it in my collection given that few people I've played with have wanted to play a second time.

The game feels too much like Mystery of the Abbey, another game that had great theme and atmosphere, but was just too chaotic to truly be considered a deduction game.  I don’t want to completely dismiss the game.  I’m sure the theme alone will garner fans, and some will not mind the somewhat chaotic nature of card passing and exchanging.  It most certainly is not a poor design.  However, for me, I prefer more control and logic when playing deduction style games.  The chaotic nature of Mystery of the Abbey doomed that game for me, and has likely done the same here.  Pity.

To be fair, I generally don't like deduction games--but this one struck me as a particularly unpleasant instantiation of the genre. Cards are always moving around, so it's tedious to track who had what when in order to reach any meaningful conclusions. Similarly, you could hand a boon to your opponent if you forget what they're already seen.
And the time mini-games are vile. Simply vile. Baroque artwork renders a stupid tacked-on element frustrating and pointless.

It's a deduction game which makes it not really my cup of tea already, but I thought perhaps there would be more to it. Really, all the actions seem to add complication without adding strategy.

As a side note, the paint seems to come off the pieces very easily, which is also a dissapointment.

The game that taught me that games go out of print for a reason. Mystery Express is the game everyone wants to love. The components are top notch and the theme is ripe for deduction. Yet, the mechanics feel too dissimilar; and the game never lets you live up to the idea of being a detective. 

+Beautiful components and art
-The Time of Death mechanic is bad
-Needlessly complex
-Time consuming with a small payoff

Brain. Buster. This is Clue on steroids as you try to find the culprit, the city, the motive and the weapon (each with two copies of the card) -- as well as the time (three copies of each) -- before the Orient Express reaches its final destination. There are limited rounds and you can exchange cards with the board to make it even harder. If you're not sober, awake and attentive when you play, you're totally screwed. NOT for fans of Days Of Wonder family games like Ticket To Ride who think it will be similar fun.

PLUS: improves Clue
MINUS: too much information hurts brains...

Only played it once so far. I want to play some more.

Suffers a bit from not being Clue(do). The game I played of it, every one approached it like it was Clue. Thing is with Clue you need to work out which cards are missing, with ME there are two copies of each card so really you are tring to find two copies to work out what cards are missing.

Also the cards move around so just because Tom had a card two turns ago he might not still have it.

Shift your mind set and I think it's a great game.

Just too slow with too much downtime.  Very 'euro' - there are locations with various 'powers' and characters with various 'powers' but I don't think it actually adds up to much.  Cluedo remains comfortably ahead of the rest in deduction games.

RATING: 6
A lot can hinge on the reveal of the clocks. It's important and somewhat trivial to devise a scheme to properly remember which one's you've seen. If you haven't taken the time to do this you are more-or-less doomed, if you have it is not very interesting.

The rest of the game is okay, but struggles to be notable in the genre. I would take Mystery of the Abby over this if you want a light family deduction game.

RATING: 7
Initial rating, definitely subject to change.  When I first read about the game, I immediately dismissed it as being too similar to Mystery of the Abbey, which I really dislike.  I don't like MotA because of the impossibility of deducing anything.  With so many cards being passed around, the only way to ever really know anything is by seeing as many cards as possible.

In this game there are still a lot of cards changing hands, but since there are five different things to figure out, and 2 of each card, it is not as frustrating.  If you approach the game more as being about using the actions the best you can to target a certain player's hand rather than being a pure deduction game, it is more satisfying.  

I would like to play it a couple more times before making a final decision but at this point I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is nice for a change of pace from other games.  It doesn't fill me with the same thrill that Clue used to as a kid, but Clue now days is just too easy.

RATING: 5
The old Orient Express game was a favorite of mine. This game sadly doesn't even seem to be as good. The entire game system is an exercise in revealing cards. Every action you take is designed to get your opponents to reveal cards to you in such a fashion that you can eliminate the clue.

Too dry and boring. Plus the same problem with Mystery of the Abbey exists here (i.e. when cards are passed around, its very hard to track) -- reduced to some degree, but still existent.

A good, fun and thematically strong deduction game in which many interesting "mini mechanisms" like the tiebreaker and memory game combine well. This definitely seems to be a five player game and first plays might take a really long time as you'll have to learn the different actions well in order to play quicker as otherwise you'll just keep reading their functions over and over again. Minor elements of chance are probably going to disturb some players.

This game did not impress me.  I enjoy deduction games and they are few and far between.  This game is just too much deduction.  It takes deduction to the level of pure guessing.  It is simply too difficult to get any meaningful information to make an educated guess at the end of the game.  It felt futile to me. I've only played once though and would certainly play it again.

Played it the 2nd time now. I like it a lot, especially as it is a game that I can play with my girlfriend. I generated two important learnings though:

1. I recommend to house-rule the amount of information that is allowed to be noted on the sheets. We learned that it hinders the gameplay if someone notes every bit of information (who passed the card to whom, etc.). Therefore we made the house-rule that it's only allowed to do lines and crosses (like it got shown in the rulebook).

2. I recommend to develop time-saving processes. Especially needed for the compartment car. Always finish the card process before noting the information for one car action. For example: After chosing the compartment car, every player needs to hand over the new card before noting the received card.

Another improvement would be to always lay out the complete hand in front of oneself on the table. It's easier to see which card colors are available for the active player.

Those things are important as the game drags itself a little bit, because the other players might have nothing to do for 10 minutes otherwise!

I love deduction games... but they have to be good. Mystery Express isn't. The deduction system used here is quite different compared to the "regular systems", but I don't know if that works that well. Yes, you still get some of the groups definitely right but with some others you have to guess more or less. But the way how you should solve the time of crime is definitely ridiculous and very annoying. And last... the game turns doesn't offer enough interesting and different kind of decisions to be made.

Think of this one as Mystery of the Abbey 2.0

It's an action point system that uses card peeks and passes to gather information and then "deduce" the 4 of the 5 major factors of the murder.

Too slow and chaotic to be a decent deduction game. Not as bad as Mystery of the Abbey in that regard, but still poor.
You end guessing (and relying on luck of the draw) as much as you "deduce" (by a quite banal elimination process coupled with tedious bookkeeping).
A couple of mechanics throwed in just for the sake of diversity don't help at all.
The usually fine DoW components can't save a very weak ruleset.

Great game of deduction, strategy and memory. The game has decent re-playability in that after a few games, you can indeed develop an accounting system to quicken and more robustly solve the crime. I think folks who looking for raw mathematical games, this functions well as well as satisfying a mild element of "screwing over" opponents and there are subtle strategies to employ in how you prevent opponents from learning critical info.
The game gets an increased rating simply because it functions well as a gateway game for people who don't want luck to play a roll in the game.

I was hoping this would be like Clue without the shitty roll-and-move aspect, and it is. It's also Clue on steroids, with more to track, more vectors for tracking and losing track of it, and more layers -- too many for my tastes.

It is surprisingly difficult (or at least I found it to be), but that's not necessarily a downside. I expected it to feel lighter than it did; it's not really a casual game. It's definitely too long, even accounting for first plays taking longer than normal.

The bits, per Days of Wonder's usual, are gorgeous. For a game with a small board, it takes up a lot of space and uses that space fully.

While I like that everyone's in it until the end, I dislike that guessing without much information is a fairly viable strategy.

All of that added up to a game I didn't want to play a second time, so I sold it.

The best Clue-like deduction game!  But also very hard!  The good thing is that you do not need to SOLVE the murder, but only find the MOST cards (who?, where? with what? when? and why?)

I don't know about you, but my collection was screaming for update of Clue/Cluedo. Clue is actually pretty good game for its age, but its genre is one that hasn't been paid much attention to in modern boardgaming.  This is very good update by some of my favorite designers. Great DoW-quality components and mostly smooth gameplay. Could be slightly less complex, especially the time cards so sadly it's not a complete replacement for Clue.

2-Player Comment:
* Sadly Mystery Express wasn't designed with two in mind. See BGG Forums for several different unofficial 2p variants (basically you play with third 'dummy player'). They work decently.

Way better than Clue, I was really excited to find out what the hidden cards were at the end.  Our first game went long, but I think it'll speed up now that we're familiar.  Not complicated enough to be bothersome, be challenging enough to be engaging. Liked it!

Good deduction game but might be a bit too much luck with people guessing at the end (especially with more people when you can't see all the cards you want).

I played with 4... probably would be shorter/less chaotic/better with 3.

I LOVE the theme and concept. It just takes TOO LONG for the crowd it is aimed at. The train rooms are creative, but are different excuses for passing cards in different ways. You seriously have to have master note-taking skills to do well in this game. Oh, and the time element is pure rubbish. By far the lamest mechanic ever in a game with this much theme. EVERRRRRRRR!!!!!

It's basically Clue except you try and determine 5 elements of the murder instead of 3. Instead of asking and then having people slide you a card to peek at you use various gimmicky mechanics to see other people's cards. 4 of the things you need to figure out are location, suspect, method and motive. The 5th is time of the murder. For the time however you use a completely different mechanic from the rest of the game and it is the dumbest game mechanic in the history of boardgaming.

First play was a pretty bad experience. It's not a bad game, but not my kind of game. Trying to keep track of who has seen what, and which cards I handed to whom feels like work for me and is pretty frustrating. I don't usually find memory elements interesting or fun in games, and this was no exception.

RATING: 7.5
The deductive element with the four categories that are handled as part of the "normal" game mechanic worked very well when I played; I had two things nailed in the first game, three in the second.  Even when you don't know things for certain, you usually have them narrowed down enough at the end of the game to make a very good guess.  The "time" feature seems a little odd, as it doesn't really fit with the rest of the game, but it didn't detract from our experience.  Both of our games were a lot of fun with every participant turning in a competitive performance.

Additional observation after one more play: I think my biggest concern with this game is the random element at the end where a player with less knowledge who guesses well will beat a player with more knowledge who guesses poorly. In the additional play, I won the game hitting all five elements; but I knew none of them! The nearest I came was a 50/50 on the method (a passenger card never entered play), and the rest were educated guesses among two or three possibilities where I eliminated options based on rough guesses about the likelihood that separate revelations across the table in different rounds were the same card. I beat at least one player who knew two elements to a certainty. As much as I like to win, I was a little guilty where by all appearances, I hadn't played the best game.

The search for a grown-up Clue continues. While this is an improvement, it's just not all that challenging. Sure, nobody can figure out the time of the crime, but everything else just seems obvious as long as you use the Beginner's Advice and target one aspect of the crime per turn. Furthermore, the downtime was borderline intolerable in our three-player game; I can't imagine playing with more. If this is the best we've got to replace Clue, then I'll just keep working through [boardgame=2511][/boardgame].

State-of-the-art deduction game. A little fiddly to learn, but once you start to get the flow of it, goes quickly and is oozing with great art, pitch-perfect theme, and fun interaction. People who are prone to over-thinking and analysis paralysis will hate it (and do poorly in my experience). People who are more intuitive thinkers (like me) will enjoy it more and do better.

A wonderful new mystery game! I am a touch disappointed in that the mechanics are not all that new...it feels like a new way of playing Clue (sort of without the roll and move part)! I certainly like it better than Clue! It is quite fun to play; the card play is simple and yet enjoyable! It is also less chaotic than Mystery of the Abby...but Mystery of the Abby is definitely much more unique in how it plays out! Needs more plays...

Overall, I was hoping for a new way of playing a deduction game! What I got was a clever old style deduction game that seems streamlined and updated! Having said all this, the Murder on the Orient Express type theme is absolutely awesome...a great setting for a murder!

OK.  Enjoyed one 3-player game.  It dragged a little, though I'm sure it would improve on another play or two since much of that was due to unfamiliarity with the possible actions.

It's one big exercise in deduction that needs either a very good memory or extensive note taking. One part in particular I didn't like was the time deck. There are 6 possible 'time' cards, 3 copies of each. One is missing from the deck, and you have to find out which one. The mechanic is that you get to see all the cards 3 times during the game, each time in a single event where you have to notice the missing one by remembering which cards you've seen. :gulp: Not my idea of fun.

The game is like Cluedo, but instead of 3 parameters there are 5, and instead of each card being unique, there are 2 copies of each (3 for the 'time'). So seeing one copy of a card doesn't eliminate anything, you have to know where both copies are at the same time to be certain. The problem is players are frequently trading cards with one another, some are on the board, some get traded with the board, some go on your discard pile (face down) etc. Trying to keep track of everything is a nightmare. I can see how some people might find it fun, but this game gave me a headache.:zombie:

RATING: 5
Not so much an express as an extremely tedious slowcoach when playing with 5, much better with 3. The deduction genre twist is that there are two of each card, so the only way to rule out a card is to see both of them on the same turn. Or, try and keep track of every card swap, so you know the card you're seeing right now for the first time can not possibly be the same card you saw in x's hand last turn and therefore you can rule it out. And trying to keep track of all that can really bog the game down. There's a mix of actions you can do each time to try and get an edge on card knowledge over the other players, but you never feel like you're doing anything cunning or decidedly different - you're just trying to work out how you can see as many cards you haven't seen before as possible, usually in one category if possible so you can max the chances of ruling stuff out. The mechanic for working out the time of death (flipping through a deck at speed and keeping count in your head) is no one's favourite - not enjoyable. And in the end it's a lottery, as you can win by taking a bunch of 50/50 guesses in the categories you don’t know for sure. This game has missed the key element, fun, and replaced it with work.

Extremely disappointed with the below average quality of the components! This one was made in China and ruins the high quality reputation of Days of Wonder board games. Don't know what they thing at DoW, but I'm not going to pay the same money for less quality! Very unfortunate, since I love the game's theme, mechanic and all... just the components....

- Rules are okay, there are a lot of things to be remembered at first, like special rules at stations, the different actions you can do in the different wagons, but once you played it for the second time, nothing else to hold you back! A bit tougher to explain to newcomers!

This is just a complex variation of clue (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1294/clue). It's more messy and less fun.

Get rid of the 'Time of Death' cards, whole mechanic a bit unnecessary, except perhaps with advanced players.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play: A game of deduction and memory. You have to try and find out who, why, where, at what time and how a murder took place. The twist is, there is more then one of each card and they come back in play each round, so you must basically restart your analysis at each turn. The game does a good job of helping you track things, but without a lot of paying attention or a lot of extra paper, it is tough, but that is what makes the game interesting. Some people may be turned off by all the memory and deduction, but for the others, it is a pretty good game.

Simple and entertaining deduction game. It quite possible to not be able to determine all the crime elements if cards are played in a particular order, or if people do not circulate the hidden cards during the game. The time cards seem daunting, but developing a good system to eliminate them is the key to getting that one aspect right. On our first play most of us got three of the crime elements, and I got four of them, one being a correct guess.

Bleah.  A pretty dull deduction game that mainly relies on one's ability to track the cards as they make their way from player to player.  The board is basically unnecessary and bothered the heck out of me as I was forced to move a pawn from train to train to simply execute different actions.  As a final kicker, the whistle that comes with the game, doesn't even work!

RATING: 6
First play with 3 and the first impression is this is not a game to play when mental energies are low otherwise you may feel too confused and disliking the experience and appreciating the classic design of Cluedo. 

The main strain is on the memory as you are trying to track the duplicates of suspect, location, motive and MO cards (or triplicates in regard time of murder) that are being moved around or temporarly inaccessible which you have to eliminate as being a feature of the crime.

Obviously the solution to this is an enhanced way of notation that Cluedo veterans may enjoy. But such scribblings may drag the race pace, ruining the session. 

Another strain on a tired brain is to first familiarise the carriage effect and assess its usefulness in pining down a desired card (type). Which brings up the much-maligned manner the time feature is 'deduced' which I agree feels like an unnecessary diversion, as is the bag which opposes the amount of mental work being used by being a coin toss. They both add fun, but don't sit well with the genre or maybe I shouldn't be so serious about murder.

I reallllly want to love this game, but I don't. It is just ok. I like the overall concept a lot, but it just takes too much focus to be "fun" sometimes.  It has a rough learning curve (especially if you don't have someone to learn the play from) and also feels very long. I love games that can take 2 hours but feel like 30 minutes and leave you wanting to play again. If I had to guess, this game takes 2 hours and feels like 2 hours and I am usually glad that it is over - bad sign. I would still play it if someone asked me to though!

It took us a little while to figure out the rules, simply because this is not as much like Clue as we expected. Once we understood the rules, it became much easier to play. Don't just the game after only one play...it will probably take at least one game before you feel like you know what you're doing.

There is a lot going on in this game but there are lots of chances to figure out clues in each turn. Very fun game and great interaction between players! A definite buy for anyone who likes deduction games!

I need to play it again to give it a fair shot. My first impression is that I would rather be playing Clue (which I enjoy a lot). Too many moving parts and hard to see what difference the various choices available in the train cars make. Cards get passed around so it's hard to pin down the who, what , where, why, when through logical deduction. Just seemed too long for me. In Clue there is pressure to take a gamble and end the game. Here it has to play out to the fixed end point.

RATING: 7.5
Mystery Express is very thematic and well designed.  It requires paying close attention to observing all of the happenings between players.  The actions to be performed in each of the train cars are complicated on the first play and makes it harder to establish a cohesive strategy to pursue.  However, I see this improving the more one plays the game.

Just as (American) novelists keep trying to write the "Great American Novel", some board game designers chase after the "Great Deduction Game", a game that requires the interesting logical elements of deduction games, but still allows for the educated guess, a game where clues can be murky and useful at the same time.  A game where you figure things out a little more like you would in real life, and less like you would in a Martin Gardner problem.  

Mystery Express is an interesting attempt at the genre.  In my first (and so far only) play, I managed to get the answers to all five questions right (murderer, weapon, location, motive, time of murder), despite the fact I wasn't 100% sure about *ANY* of my answers.  I had logically narrowed down most of the questions down to two or three possibilities, and then had to look at more murky clues to guess between those possibilities.  I have never played a deduction game where this level of "educated guessing" was possible, and I was impressed.

Still, to be honest, until the very end of the game, I was more bored than impressed.  The "educated guessing" aspect doesn't kick in until the very end of the game. For most of the game, you are trying to solve the puzzle using hard logic, which, unfortunately, isn't that hard.  Unlike Sleuth, each nugget of information doesn't have subtle ramifications that require you to really think it though.  You just write down who had what, and try as best you can to track the clue cards as they move around the table. 

In place of an interesting deduction aspect, the game gives more interesting strategic questions--what your focus should be on each turn, how to best hide information from other players, whether you should chase for the "perfect" answer, or if your half-guessed answer will be good enough.  These strategic decisions may sound routine, but the fact that you base your decisions on half-forgotten scribblings on your notepad gives it the proper headache-inducing feeling you expect from deduction games (which, to me, is a good thing).  

The game is as beautiful as Mystery of the Abbey (which is to say, one of the most beautiful board games I've ever seen) and it is more thoughtful.  I wish it were still a little more thoughtful than this even--something where good logical thought might give more of an advantage than it does--but still my overall impression is positive.  

The downtime was significant in our game (I think our 4-player game took us 2 1/2 hours, including rules description), but I have hopes that future games can be completed in a more reasonable time.

Speaking of time, the "time of murder" aspect is both a clunky and fun addition.  I enjoyed greatly trying to read the clocks, trying not to burst out laughing while everyone was silently studying cards trying not to get distracted.   It made for a kind of a welcome, but frantic, "commercial break" between the more ponderous thinking of the rest of the game.  Will this portion still be fun after playing a few more times?  Time will tell. 

I should say this is a pretty tentative rating.  I have concerns about downtime, but I have some hope that both the logic and strategy aspects are deeper than I was able to mine in my first game.

Kind of a fancier version of clue, with some more 'board gamey' elements. Has an interesting timer, too. We've only played it once, but basically the overall comparison was 'more complicated clue'. Not sure if that's a good thing or not. Minimum of 3 players hurts the game for me.

For my wife. It will be one of her 2010 Xmas gifts. Sad, huh? I guess you know you're a BGGer when you buy a loved one a gift, that gift is a board game... and the recipient isn't really into board games (in essence, you're just finding another way to sneak 1 more game into the house). Actually, she's heavy into mysteries and Agatha Christie so I'm hoping this one will get played. We'll need to draft a kid or 2 as I guess it doesn't play well as a 2 player game. More to come on this one!

Bought this for my wife as she really enjoys deduction games and this has went over really well for her. It does feel like a better Clue. The time cards are a little silly and easily solvable, but I have seen many non-gamers get really enthused by them.

RATING: N/A
From reading the rules, this sounds like it might be quite fun. I'm a sucker for murder mysteries, but am a little wary what with all the negative press this received. passing cards around and seeing discard piles might not reflect the theme that well, but there's something charming about the whole thing anyway. And this'd have more elements of a crime to figure out than Mystery of the Abbey, which I've really enjoyed. There the end game can be a bit of a let down if most players figure it out at the same time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
This game is very much like Clue, but in my opinion strictly better. More things to narrow down, two copies of every card, and a variety of ways to get information make this the Clue successor of choice for me (beating Mystery Of The Abbey by a hair).

RATING: 7.5
Nice deduction game with beautiful production values. Deduction occurs over several formats, so a player's difficulty in one does not necessarily mean a loss. However, proficiency in all formats is obviously stronger. 

I like this one- the theme, the look- but there's a time and attention commitment which some appear to not enjoy.

I was a little disappointed, I was so hoping for a great deductive game.  It is a good game but not a great game.  The information is just trakable enough to make it possible but lots of work which causes the game play to slow down.  I am thinking I will like it better with more plays so I need to try it again.

I'm generally not a fan of deduction games. Too often they either swamp you with a memory aspect or reward really thorough note taking. Often the deduction part comes a poor second to these skills and quite frankly you sit there feeling like you're taking minutes of a meeting at work. With all that said, if I was persuaded to play a memory game it might just be this one.

Rules are easy. The pace is decent. The bits are lovely. The excitement is not really there though. The game feels a bit easy - except for discovering the time - this was fun and hard.

For a deduction game Days of Wonder has put on a good show, but it's not really a genre I get excited about.

An excellent deduction game that is much more difficult than any other I have played. Imagine Cluedo but with 2 copies of every card instead of 1 - and they're being passed from player to player every turn! Sure, the Time element is a little unusual, but it just makes this game more unique. Unfortunately its difficulty means not many people want to play this one multiple times.

Will podcast on it shortly. A sleuthing game which does have a 'Clue-on-Steroids' feel in that there are two of each type of card (and five things to sort out rather than three) so you can only remove a motive/suspect/location/modus operandi when you've seen both cards in a turn - and the cards do move around a lot. Instead of running around a board, you visit train cars with varying abilities that will allow you to peek at the cards of others, chat up the conductor and even hit up some passengers for their information.

The theme of a trip with different stops where specific things help you works well and there are a few nice mechanics to keep you from hoarding cards (you discard to a local deck so you can't keep showing the same cards).

Most unusual is the way you figure out the time of the crime. Bauza and Laget have come up with three ways to quickly show you a mix of cards to help you figure out the missing time card. You'd better be good at reading clock-faces without numbers...

Your interest in Mystery Express will be highly dependent on your love/hate for this kind of game. As always, DoW has done a magnificent job with the production quality (those lovely boxes are back, too) - including nice busts for the players (although the conductor in our box is a zombie, as he's gray and missing a nose!)

A nice addition to the DoW library. I need a couple more plays before the final rating and review on Boardgame Babylon (we played with only three and I want to see it with four/five) but there are some quick thoughts.

The game moved a bit slow for my tastes, but I love deductive reasoning and just like Mystery of the Abbey, this hearkened well to my old days playing Clue. I liked the idea you have free reign on the board and that each train car could be a destination on purpose. The randomness of the movement in Clue is always one of the negative aspects of it. As usual, the game's components were top-notch and it was dripping with theme.

Well, there's no point playing Mystery of the Abbey anymore.  This one scratches the same itch for a not-lame-Clue, and unlike MotA you actually have some chance of strategy and clever play actually paying off.  Lots of strategic depth, continual and critical player interaction, tense decisions, very good use of theme.  Keeps your little grey cells working, mon ami!

1 play, 5er.

This is a deduction game where, like Clue, a murder has been committed. Players must deduce the murderer, motive, method, location, and time of the crime. These are determined in the usual Clue-like manner: removing cards from the various decks. The twist here is that, except for time (which has 3 cards for each of 8 possible times), every card has 2 copies. Most of the rest of the cards are distributed amongst players, with a few available in one of several pools available some time during the game.

There are 5 game Rounds, each of variable length. The Round length is given in time (hours), where each player can take a variety of actions (each of different time cost) until they use up their time for the Round. These actions involve getting a peek at someone's card (of a specific type), passing cards, drawing cards from the hidden pool, etc. As players use cards, they move from their hand to individual discard piles, unavailable (for the most part) until the next Round. Because there are 2 of every card (other than the solution), and because cards are constantly moving around between players, the only way to conclusively eliminate a characteristic (other than time) is by seeing it twice on the same turn. Players can defend against that, by taking good notes and showing you only what you've seen before, but I think you can mostly get around that with careful (and coordinated?) use of the various actions.

The time element is different: you will go through the cards in 3 different ways at 3 stages of the game. Players must observe and count in order to figure out which single card is missing. At first glance, this is difficult. However, there is a [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/502059/how-to-solve-the-time-puzzle]very simple method[/url] to make this solution easy.

I liked the game -- maybe because I won by getting all 5 correct? -- but not as much as I'd hoped. It seemed to last a bit too long. Will try it again to see if it plays faster.

RATING: 5
I enjoy most deduction games with the exception of Mystery of the Abbey, which it's related to.  I like this game better, but the mechanic of following the flow of cards is uninteresting to me.  Overall, it's still sort of fun, maybe a little long, featuring a couple too many rules to needlessly complicate the game, and there is some luck in guessing at the end.  I wouldn't turn it down but wouldn't request it either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not the biggest fan of deduction games with a few exceptions.  This particular game actually surprised me with how much I enjoyed it.  If I'm going to play a deduction game this would probably be it.

This game is essentially Clue+.  At the beginning of the game a mode, motive, suspect, location, and time are all set aside as details of a murder.  There are 2 copies of every detail (except time, there are 3 copies of each time) so you spend the game trying to figure out which 5 details have one card missing from the rest of the pool.  This is done by taking different actions which have you looking at cards in other people's hands as well as a few that are sitting on the board.  The kicker to all this is that there are six rounds and cards constantly change hands and are recollected from discard at the end of each round.  There is even an action on the train that forces a player to recollect their discarded cards to confuse deduction further.

That's what really gives this game teeth.  It's not just looking at information until you've narrowed something down.  It's knowing how best to manage information that is in a constant state of flux.  This is both much more difficult but also much more engaging than other deduction games and I really enjoyed it.

The mechanics for figuring out the time of the murder are a little hokey though and I wasn't a fan of those.  At 3 different points in the game 3 different methods of revealing the time cards to all players are performed.  This isn't well designed because unlike the rest of the game which is about pure deduction and efficient action management, one person can figure out the time just because they have a more photographic memory than others.  Succeeding in this has more to do with your personal mental strengths and even though all players get the same amount of information one player could figure it out while others don't through no part of actual gameplay.  I just think that's a horrible design decision.

It also is really long for what it is.  An accessible deduction game shouldn't take 2 hours.  BGG says 75 minutes but I think that's overly ambitious.  Don't get me wrong, a deduction game inherently has some "AP" although I don't even know if it's fair to call it that since you need to work through the information you collect to play well.  But because of the amount of information, actions, and number of turns and frequency and erratic movement of the information this game can drag at points.

Probably the best of the Cluedo variants that are available. Remembering to place the cards to discard each time sometimes gets missed, but the game plays fairly quickly and isn't too heavy. Trying to remember if you've seen a card before from the player that just showed it to you is quite fun. Good game to play with kids and family as well.

Deduction game, if by "deduction" you mean waiting while players write down everything that happens, then we all guess the missing cards.

The 60-90 minute estimate might reflect the fact we're expected to play in a light & breezy, intuitive fashion. Our 2.5 hour game of note-taking suggests this is [b]not[/b] the way to play the game, not if you want to have fun, anyway.

I'm open to another play, but people who won't play fast might need to be pushed along. Perhaps with a cattle-prod.

Played for the first time (3-player) and while it was fun, it did seem that I had little control over which card I could see.  In every case, people would hand cards over that had already been seen.  The dining room became a favorite as it allowed people to go through someone's hand one by one.  I did enjoy, however.  And one of my friends (who won) absolutely LOVED it.  The other friend was luke warm to it.

The timing mechanism didn't seem fun, but added an interesting twist to the gameplay.  I think the time mechanism needs to be modified somehow.

Will play again to see if I can figure a way to control the cards better...

Harder than Cluedo - Every card has 2 copies. So when you see a card, you know nothing. You must remember who has what card. Sometimes some player give some card to another and you don`t know what card is it. So you want be know everything. You must guess.

You have 5 categorys. 4 standard + time. You have only 3 moments in the game, when you can find out, what time someone dies. 

Interesting mechanic, but i think the turns coud be too similar. Often the players try to do the same think. Because every player has the same time in a turn (diferent actions take diferent time), but usually you want to make the action with the conductor (free bonus action). 

During the game game you must cocentrate on the road of the cards. Sp it is not a light family game.

After only a few plays, the game seems to me a bit too complex for occasional players, and still with some luck factor and even a "memory" mechanic (the hours) that could disappoint most experienced gamers looking for a really strategic challenge.
For gamers, it's an improvement from Mystery of the Abbey, so if you're a gamer and you are a fan of deduction games, you will like it. And if you are an occasional player looking for something more than Clue or MotA, give it a try, you might love it.

Days of Wonder jumps the shark.  Mystery Express contains too many cards that convey too little information.  The clock deck is utterly cuckoo.  And since clues are shared by silently passing cards back-and-forth, there is diminished social interation.  The game lasts an hour too long and the final accusations turn out to be guesses anyway.   What we need here are more monks.

There's a good game here, it's just bogged down by complexity of actions, cards being put in your discard pile, trading cards into other players' discard piles, conductor, passengers, and a random weird mechanism for time.

It's too long and too complex/random for a good deduction game.  Unless you want to memorize who has your cards and the probability that card is now with the conductor or will show you the same card you've seen before, then give this game a hard pass.
I was hoping for a Clue killer, I think Mystery at the Abby, Mysterium, or Sherlock 13 would be better for pure deduction.

This is a good mystery game.  I like how there are two-cards of each item {except for the truth} to make the decision process harder.  ME does a great job of recycling and forcing new information, and the Time-allowance system works well in gathering info.  My only complaint is that it is a longer game where you are not likely to have all of the information at the end.

I feel like the rating system is breaking down for me on this game.  What's that you say?  I'm the first person to ever suggest the ratings on BGG aren't completely objective measures of a game's relative quality.  I digress.  The point is that this game seems like a good game.  There is a lot going on and information is flying around like a house fly on crack.  Actually I padded my rating a bit because I do think this is a quality game... I just can't see a scenario where I would play it again.  There so much that you need to keep track of that I just can't.  This isn't so much deduction like Sleuth, but more like information mining with a (for me) very annoying need for a good memory (which, you may have gathered, I don't have).  It isn't just that I know I have no real hope of winning the game as much as I'm just hopeless to keep the necessary information straight that I don't even bother trying.

Deduction game that I thought worked pretty well, as compared to something like Mystery Abbey. There are various spots on the board that you use to manipulate the cards in each players hand, things like "each player has to show you a card", "each player chooses a card and hands it to the player on their left", and so on. As each card gets moved, it ends up in a discard pile, unable to be shown to you again, which means that if you're clever, you can see enough cards on your turn to know what the missing cards are, and therefore what the crime is.

Because the actions are defined, it's extremely difficult for someone to mess up, and cause the game to fail. You don't ask them questions like "Are you holding a card of this kind", and they incorrectly say no when they do in fact have one. Cards are also colour coded, so you know exactly what type of cards everyone has, and how many.

Nice non gamer's game that is a bit too long. Can be enjoyable once in a while.

One play and a nice experience. I managed to get a win with full points by many lucky guesses. Anyway, even with a worse result, I would have liked this. True detective game, although it took us almost three hours to finish, which is way too much.

Players board the famous Orient Express in Paris just as a murder occurs. The rest of the trip - through Strasbourg, Munich, Vienna, Budapest and their final destination of Istanbul - is consumed with determining the who, what, when, where and why of the crime. Players use their special powers of deduction; information gleaned from others in various train cars; and investigative actions to determine the exact circumstances of the murder. The one who correctly identifies the most elements of the crime by the time the train reaches Istanbul wins the game.
\13\\13\Mystery Express is a classic Days of Wonder design made up of top-notch components and unique, period-perfect illustrations. Along with the Mystery Express board map detailing its itinerary from Paris to Istanbul the game features: 5 resin character figures and matching character tokens; 5 Ticket wallets that include a description of each character's special power; 100 Deduction sheets that players use to keep track of their deductions; 72 Crime cards; a Mystery Express miniature train to track the Mystery Express's journey on the map; a Conductor figure; 2 small passenger tokens, a miniature travel bag, a train whistle and rules booklet.

Tedious deduction game. Some original ideas, but the game was not fun to play.

I really wanted to like this because there aren't many deduction games in my collection. A typical Days of Wonder release, the components are fantastic both in terms of quality and art work. The rules seemed very interesting as well, at least until I played it. My problems with the game are two-fold. One, it takes too long. Deduction games take a lot of concentration, so when one runs too long it really makes the time drag. Second, there are a multitude of ways for the players to manipulate and mix piles of already explored cards. This can make it nearly impossible to narrow down the possibilities of whodunit. There are five questions to solve and the player who produces the most right answers, wins. Typically the winner is only going to get 2 or 3 right, with the other two or three answers being more or less wild guesses. Since it's fairly easy to confirm at least two answers but nearly impossible to get more than that, the end game feels random. It's too long of a game to have the winner determined by the best guess and as a result, Mystery Express is not going to be joining the Team Digression stable any time soon...

Versione potenziata di un classico dei giochi deduttivi come il" Mistero dell'Abbazia", qui però viene implementato e reso anche più divertente. Il tema è il classicissimo omicidio sull'Orient Express per il resto ci sono trovate molto efficaci e simpatiche.

While this game is generally considered to be Clue on steroids, it is in fact a big "screw your neighbor" type game.  I like this game alot for its deduction elements, but the fact that there are elements that promote the ability to "screw your neighbor" has not made it a widely accepted game for my family.  The mystery of it is totally overshadowed by the strategic need to hoard cards and deny rival detectives from determining the time of the murder by racing through the Time Cards deck without giving others a chance to even glance at the cards makes this a shelved box until someone gets the hankering for a competitive beer-n-pretzels game...

Super Clue!  This is a deduction style game that plays like Clue on steroids.  The "time" element is very interesting and if you like deduction/puzzle games this game is worth trying for that aspect alone.

Another beautiful game from Days of Wonder, although one that I have a hard time getting people to play because of how slow and drawn-out the rounds can be. With regards to this, I couldn't have put it better than Zealotrush in his comment on the game (Score 9.0, May 2010).

Rating after one game. Plays as a much better version of Cluedo, with far more necessity for deduction. I wonder how certain aspects (the time clues especially) will play out in later games.

A great concept and an aesthetically attractive game, but it simply takes too long for what it is.  There are better deduction games that I'd rather devote me time to.

I like the discovery part of the game. Having 2 cards in the mix is good, It does slow the game down as people try to maximize each turn. So my suggestion is to throw out the time of the murder element. It is not really needed and there is a trick that should be used by everyone to get the right answer.

PRO TIP: Sit in position four. Why? You're the only player able to draw a card from both reserve piles, which have three cards and are introduced in rounds 2 and 4. Why does that matter? For starters, whatever you draw is previously unglimpsed, so if the card matches anything seen once before - in ANY round - you've got one less possibility to worry about. After the card mingles among the rest of your hand nobody else knows where it came from, so if your opponents are unable to pry it out the ordeal is favorable. Naturally, having extra cards never hurt anyone; it provides fodder to throw for opponents' queries and improves your odds of being selected when the active player visits the Smoking Car. (That player will give you information in return for whatever he takes; no player is really in a position to have superior information than any other - except player four, of course - so the more you swap or see cards the better your chances of ruling out possibilities.) I noted two actual strategies during our game, and the first doesn't count. (Follow the conductor for the free action - no surprise there.) That leaves undertaking a big push between turns. Starting the turn with four-ish suspects and revealing or trading for as many as possible (Lounge Car, basically) is a player's best shot at process of elimination. If you lucksack and succeed, rinse and repeat by using Smoking Car to rid yourself of the now-useless cards in exchange for your next push. What's funny is that it's much easier to attack people in this game (Smoking Car to give them cards you're confident they don't need, same with Passenger, Lounge Car if they have a single copy of a card type and that card is something they've already eliminated) than determine the correct answer with absolute certainty so the final result is essentially who's fortunate enough to guess correctly. Sleeping car, the extraneous "Time" element ... quality mechanics just create themselves, don't they?

A board game with an interesting theme, where players try to solve a murder on a train and you have to investigate who committed the crime and when. Good game with short game play (around 60 minutes). I enjoy it!

I've played this game four times now with my family, and each time it gets better. There's this fantastic juggling act you need to perform of trying to remember all the information, and keeping of track of where it goes. The game goes through different phases. When it starts you pick up clues rather quickly, each thing you perform is helping you and moving you forward. Toward the middle things tend to get tricky as you start to wonder "Am I being shown the same card over and over again, or is this the second one?". Then as thing move to the end the picture starts to become clear, and the pieces come together.
If you like Clue at all, and don't mind a bit more complexity, you will love this. It's a shame it seems to be so hard to find.

A large majority of users on BGG have certain expectations of their games.  Among them is that a game that requires logical thought as its principal means of achieving victory should necessarily award that victory to the player who took the most logical actions throughout the game.  When that philosophy is applied to this game it results in tedious notetaking, using those notes to minimize the information your opponents get and trying to see as many cards as possible each turn during the limited time you have available in the train.

Counter-intuitively, in this case those behaviors all make the game less fun.  Why?  Tedious notetaking makes the game take longer and reduces the interaction between players.  Selecting each card shown carefully to minimize the information everyone else gets ultimately makes the end game more random.  And using your time in what is ostensibly the most efficient manner actually diminishes the amount of information you will get in the long term because it results in less "card turnover" in your opponents' hands, giving them the ability to repeatedly show you cards they know you've seen.  So naturally when all this is finished, in spite of ... nay, BECAUSE of all BGGers' best efforts to behave logically (which most of them do very well) the game is decided by little more than an unfulfilling coin flip.

No wonder no one likes it!  This game is at its best when it is a competition of memory, bluffing, misdirection and hand management of both your own hand and your opponents'.  Think Cosmic Encounter with memory instead of negotiation.  I'm almost certain this is what the designers intended because it makes the "time cards" and the sleeping car fit in perfectly with the rest of the game!  The social elements of this game are what make it shine; the stories you will tell to the people who missed that game night.  The way you tricked all four of your opponents into guessing the wrong M.O. because when "Hanged" was passed around the table you made a big show of not writing anything down!

If you're having a hard time getting your group to focus less on the logic puzzle and more on the social aspects, try our house rule: do not allow players to take "notes".  They may only make up to two diagonal lines in each box.  The rest of their information must be kept in their head.  This will lead to a lot less statistical analyses and a lot more "hunches", which I think we can all agree are more fun!  If they still stonewall the entire game, then for pete's sake trade it and don't look back!

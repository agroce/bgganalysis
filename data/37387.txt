I really like this game! Played just 5 times but I want to play it again and again! The six turn makes it absolutely original but still within the Wallace style. It's the shortest and enjoyable "train" boardgame I've ever played. 60-90 minutes very well invested!

Yet another train game that really doesn't have much different than others - except that a person who doesn't hold an stock in a railroad can have the most impact on it in the end game.  That part just didn't seem right to me.

A game of bidding for control of rail companies, gaining shares and building track.  The rules are simple, but the game has depth.

The auctions are not straightforward because the cubes of the winning bid are then used to pay for track for the company.  So is bidding higher worthwhile if it gets the company and me greater profit?  Or do I need to save money in the hope of controlling another company now or next turn?  And how much will my share be worth in the cube harvesting end game? Similarly, in track building there are issues of short term profit versus potential future expansion and end game dividends.

So, a very streamlined system that gives you lots to think about.  A game that speeds through its five turns with hardly any downtime.  The one  negative for me is that with five or six players the cube delivery endgame can feel a bit of a lottery.

Artwork and production are both fine, though I would have preferred even Age of Steam plastic coins to the paper money included.

Easy and quick to teach and play network building game. The uncertainty of the final scoring eliminates any kingmaker problems. Plays in about an hour. Elegant game. I like the short term decisions (cash grabbing) as well as the long term decisions (stock positioning) The turn order in the last rounds is very important. All in all we have a good game that flows well and offers many strategic options for the players.

Interesting railway building & share buying game, just did not hit me too much..

RATING: 7
Fairly straightforward and not that much in the box, nevertheless not a bad game, with the aim of having the most money at the end via shares in different rail companies. The cash is gained by bidding for control for 1 round of a company, building track and getting revenue for linking new cities. It is likely that you will have different companies during different turns so you will probably have shares in 2 or 3 companies.

Funny box art.  I think the box was small.  Straightforward, spartan production.  The game itself does seem to me a lot of jostling around to score in a hard-to-determine way, potentially limiting the meaning of certain earlier moves.  Really happy with the income system which elegantly sidesteps rich-get-richer issues.  It's hard for me to see why every auctionish game shouldn't consider it. I had it in my head somehow that this was 90+ minutes but was very pleased with the ~45-60 playtime.  A second play has me more concerned about control.  I'd like to assure that there's a wider middle ground between tactical success with an optimistic eye toward the endgame and sterile calculation.  If it's even possible to deeply plan for things I fear it will be much too painful for all involved.

As with most economic games, there's just something I don't get about the flow of the game. Unlike Power Grid (where I figured out what I was doing wrong) and Container (where I think I've figured out what I'm doing wrong), I have no clue how to approach Steel Driver differently. I am looking forward to trying it a couple more times in hope of a lightbulb moment.

Many train games have a reputation for being heady gamers games and I expected this to be the case with this Wallace title as well.  I was surprised that the game was lighter than expected.  That does not mean it is a light-weight, but it is not at the level of Age of Steam.  A close cousin in weight might be Santa Fe Rails.  The game is driven by the railroad expansions and hence the title is actually a very nice choice.  The game is less about connections though and more about stock management and 'speculation'.  Game time is shorter than expected but just about right for the game's weight.  This should hit the table more often than it does.

Can't make my mind up whether this is an hour of pointless placing followed by a few minutes of meaningful activities,  or whether there is skill involved from the get-go.  On my last game, I simply aimed for maximum tactical income (no view towards end-game at all),  and I won handily.

Megkockáztatom, hogy az összes vonatos játék közül nekem ez tetszett eddig a legjobban!! Kicsit talán absztraktabb, mint a többi, de  nagyon letisztult, elüt a többitől, első hallásra nagyon egyszerű, de szerintem sokkal mélyebb, mint mondjuk a Chicago Express. Nagyon nagy a dilemma, hogy az azonnali haszonra menjen valaki vagy a játék végi bizonytalanabb pénzekre. Pont ez a játék végi pontszerzés nagyon nagy ötlet, anélkül túl egyértelmű családi játék lenne. Ajánlom bárkinek, aki szereti a vonatosokat.

Wallace made a clear, easy to understand game with uneasy decisions. Every turn we took some time for the auctions, more then we spent time in the track-building itself. It's very important to take the right shares at the right time. I will play this certainly some more and possibly heighten my score.
Several years later, the game is still good : but an 8 is good enough.

Not being a train game person, I had never heard of this until BGG.con and randomly jumped into a game of it.  I liked the bidding and rail placement as well as owning stocks. There is a ton to balance in this game especially when you want to maintain control over railroad that you have been laying track for so that in the end game you can maximize cube delivery.  I would play this again...maybe.

A unique train game where you don't own a certain company, you auction for control of the six companies each round, but if you win, you get a share to cash in at the end of the game to collect sets of goods. It all worked very well, but may be a little long for what it is. I like the aution mechanic. I want to play this one again soon.

Initial rating.

Not quite sure what to think.  The endgame scoring is a bit oddball, hard to plan for.

Warrants further play.

12-11-08:

I can't pinpoint what I like and what I don't like about the game yet.  This is an oddity.  I will have to play it more to figure it out.  I enjoy it, but there is something bothering me in the background.

Wabash/CE is a similar experience, but better.  I am nearly certain of that.

1-5-09:

I'm not sure if it is simply "really difficult" to plan for cube scoring, or if it is simply something that one cannot plan for.  I'm not sure I like the end phase after all.

5-16-09:

The cube-grabbing can swing far too drastically from a tiny difference in bidding/placement the 5th round.  One company getting blocked completely by accident on the part of another player on turn 5, thereby causing the company to pass early and get way more in cube potentials is impossible to play for.  This can cause a swing of 200 points.  It's simply too much.

The rest of the game itself is well-done.  The cube-grabbing (again, specifically the potentials swinging wildly prior to actually grabbing cubes) is just not.

RATING: N/A
An interesting stock game with a train theme that has some similarities to Chicago Express.  Players buy stock in train lines and control them on the round they acquire the stock.  You want to own shares in train lines which have access to many cities and many different colored cities.  The end game scoring is interesting with some in-game scoring that adds to things a bit.  It's not a great game, but it is decent and I'd like to try it again.

I'm very impressed by Steel Driver. SD reminds me of Union Pacific but the end game for SD is exhilerating.  It's a stock and train game with easy rules, fast playing time, and good depth as well. The game mechanics are elegant and the strategy for the win is deceptive because of the end game.  This alone increases the player tension and the fun factor as the decisions in the last game turn are brain burners.  The positional stock alliances are still there, but they don't beat you over the head. The game starts out as a short-term cash grab and that lays the foundation for a late game where focus shifts significantly to the stock. There's also a midgame bump in there with the transcontinental link. The end game is a bit heavy handed but one of the major focuses of the game is the advance manipulation of the final stock valuation. It works pretty well, lots of good long term versus short-term decisions in cash grubbing versus stock positioning for the end game. There's also some not so insignificant turn order and blocking considerations. It all comes together very well - Steel Driver is a keeper and for me ranks a 10.

Played twice with 5. In both cases we all lost to the person who bought the most shares, was well behind in the building but swept the board with dividends at the end. Beginning to wonder if there is any purpose to the track building - why not just have the share auctions?

Deeper than Tinners' Trail, which is good, but still has that dry feeling to it. It's a good game, but a very analytical, in which thinking many moves ahead is clearly the way one should go about it.

I hope Martin hasn't given up his usual style to design elegant-but-dry games...

Got it cheap. Only one game played. A simple (rules not strategy) train game. Early game seems more straightforward than steam. In the middle things get a bit chaotic, as there is a lot of stuff to keep track of. The stock system (You don´t own a railroad) is fun, but adds to the confusion. I think I like non train Wallace games better overall.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game.  Each round, all 6 RRs are auctioned.  The winner of each auction gets a share and gets to run that RR that round.  When RRs run, they lay track and get paid for each new city they go to.  The "owner" gets all of that cash.  At the end of the game, there's a little set collection mechanic using the cities RRs are connected to to determine final share price.  Shares pay out and whoever has the most cash wins.  Not a bad game, but myeh.  Not sure why'd I pick it over many other games.

Thoughts: After 2 plays, I'm confident saying it feels like Wallace does Winsome which makes sense since he got his inspiration from his Prairie RR games.  Not a bad game, and I wouldn't say no to playing it, but it's not one I'd choose over a game like SNCF.

Rating after one three player game which I enjoyed quite a bit. With three game was tad less competitive than presumably with more players. Train theme works well and there's nice feel of investing in expanding companies. Having the same amount of capital beginning of each turn is probably not the most truthful way of describing investing in companies but in it's heart Steel Driver is probably more of an auction game.

RATING: 5
I was a bit disappointed with this one.  The game seems to break down for me at the end when the cubes get sucked out and massive bonus points are awarded.   While I'm sure there is subtle strategy there to ensure that you own tracks that don't overlap on cubes, that sort of subtlety seems to be the key to the game, which makes everything else seem sort of... wasted.

Like a combination of Transamerica and 18xx.  Game doesn't feel too heavy and is fun I'd play it again.  However, it is fairly dry and lacks any kind of magic.  Also, in the game I played I had the majority shares in the best company, but the game ultimately went to the player with the most shares.  So does the game automatically go to the player with the most shares every time in spite of quality?

I was slightly disappointed in this game, although I still had a fairly good time with it.  I guess I felt that players had little to no direction in the first half of the game or so.  The second half of the game was pretty interesting once there was some development on the board, but it seemed like it just took too long to become interesting.  I felt like the same result could have been achieved by giving each player 2 random shares, putting some track on the board, and starting with turn 3.  Overall, still a nice stock holding game that I'd be happy to play once in a while.

RATING: 7
Doesn't feel like a typical Wallace game as it's pretty short and slightly abstract with little in the way of theme or artwork. It has only five turns and a restricted number of actions in which players never seem to have enough bidding cubes to take control of rail companies or to build as much track as they'd like. If you win a bid for only a few cubes you'll be lucky to do any building that turn but at least you'll still earn a share. The Trans-Continental Link is an interesting mid-game scoring mechanic though the payout isn't huge and the delivery of cubes (or hopefully sets of cubes) at the end is very tense. There appears to be a very good balance between income in the short-term (building rail links) and long-term (delivering cubes at the end due to extensive rail networks). 
Warning: Not the sort of game you really want to play with analytical types! Seriously. I'm telling you! Just don't, okay?

RATING: 6
After one play, this game seems like a highly tactical bidding contest with the illusion of a shareholding dynamic that culminates in a dry min-max puzzle. I say ‘illusion’ because the distribution of held shares seems to influence gameplay very minimally except in the last round (or maybe two) when players jockey for control of companies. Even then, the tiebreaker for control makes decisions even more tactical. The value of companies after the expansion half of the game becomes an iterative logistics min-max puzzle in the last auction whereby value depends on control, connections, and good-delivery turn-order. For me, the enjoyment of solving this puzzle is not great, doesn’t depend on the interaction of player strategies and incentives, and doesn’t flow naturally from the first phase of the game. How the puzzle is resolved renders much of the first phase null meaningless.

The tiebreaker for control is a particular problem for me since, to the degree that there is a shareholding strategy, it is dictated by the right-left binding generated by the tie-breaking mechanism.

Between the tiebreaking mechanism, the fact that during most of the game which shares you accumulate is an afterthought, the easily manipulated cube-harvest turn-order, and the fact that so much of the game is playing the position – min/maxing - and not the other players – manipulation of incentives – combine to make this game one that I am not super-excited to try again.

All that said, I will try it again to see if I’m totally wrong.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Extra-ordinarily heavily end-loaded.  The majority of the game is an effort to determine how the shares will be evaluated/scored in the end-game, and that valuation is almost entirely opaque to the early game decisions.  In short the majority of the game is over how the game will be scored.  What's particularly rough about this is that the end-game is entirely calculable once it has started, is notably non-trivial to calculate but also clearly within human comprehension and depends on an incentive graph that is in violent flux right until the end of the game.  That's a bad mix and nominally puts this at a 5 rating.

That all said there's an interesting emergence of player incentives in the game.  The incentives are post-scriptive in that the values are created before the incentives rather than creating incentives in order to then create values.  It is clever in this regard, perhaps clever enough for two rating points.

Playtime is a safe 90 minutes with attentive calculating players.  120 minutes if they sweat it a bit.  While not a major complaint, that's a bit long given how weak the first half of the game is.  Knock off half a point for undue length for a final rating of 6.5.

Update: Unfortunately the whole is not as coherent as the above might suggest: Rating reduced to 3.5.

This is a fun rail/share game.  Wallace does a good job creating a game that has some depth while being playable in a compact amount of time.  My first game was with six, which I'm not sure is the ideal number.  May actually be better to play with less than that.  Great effort by Wallace, though.

RATING: 7
Rail companies, represented by all the colors of the rainbow, forge a special bond between San Francisco and New York. Steel Driver is, without question, the gayest train game of all time.

In the 2008 Wallace Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Rules Writing, Martin is the clear front-runner in the Most Hilarious Use of Parentheses category:

"Determine who controls each company. The player with the most shares in a company will take the corresponding Company Control marker. In the case of a tie for share tokens the player closest clockwise to the player to control that company, (starting with that player), takes the control marker."

The game is fairly strong, and a refreshing change of pace from the collusion-and/or-exploitation-driven games that have dominated the table in the last year or so. Here it's every man for himself, although the auction has some timing and influence subtleties reminiscent of Princes of Florence. Gameplay is a satisfying mix of tactical point grabbing and long-term network creation. Wallace gets a lot of mileage out of a clever turn order system.

Enjoyable medium-light, no-luck train game. Rating after two 4-player games. Fun but slightly cerebral and abstract. Interesting but not as compelling as, say, Railroad Tycoon or 1830. But then, you can play 5 to 6 games of Steel Driver in the same amount of time as one 1830. So, it's all good. Still, I'm not sure if the 'Final Profit Determination' plays too important a role in the game. And the [-]stock market[/-] investment and [-]goods transportation[/-] cube-picking element is extremely simplified and very abstracted (which doesn't mean that it isn't a highly strategic game as you have to plan your moves very carefully from the get-go). A solid seven.

Wow, this one knocked my socks off.  This is the best Wallace game I've played probably since Age of Steam. I think it probably rates better than Brass, too.

I've seen lots of comparisons to various rail games, but when it comes down to it I don't think there is another game that gives me this same feel. Wallace had captured something unique here, but I can't exactly articulate it.

There are multiple systems for scoring at work here. Each round, you receive capital income (everyone gets the same) which you bid for control of a railroad (and a share of stock) which allows you to control the track-laying for that turn. The amount of track you can build depends on how much capital you've bid (and whether there was any left-over), so winning a lowball bid is a mixed result.

When builds occur, you are choosing between immediately lucrative routes (which pay you cash/points) or positioning the railroad to have strategic access to goods. More diversity of goods is more valuable in the endgame (and determines how much each share is worth). So you'd like other people to think long-term when they're building with a RR you have share(s) in. And you want to trash other people's share value with short-term builds in RR they're heavy into.

But the board gets crowded and RRs are competing with each other not to get cut out of areas as they grow. The build order for the RRs is manipulable, too, and that's ANOTHER system you can scheme with to enhance your position.

Finally, at game end, goods are placed on the map and the controlling interest-holder in each RR drafts one cities goods to be delivered by that RR. It goes around to each company until all goods are accounted for. Its a tense climax to a tense game. 

The thing that thrilled me here is that there are so many competing systems occurring simultaneously.  Each decision feels so important. And the game requires you to constantly reappraise each railroad, each potential link, and other players' intentions. There is literally no downtime if you're doing that. Its engrossing, as every other players' every choice changes the valuations. 

I look forward to playing this more. Its a game that could support expansion maps for increased longevity, although I'm not sure it will supported in that way. For now, its the game I most want to play. I ordered a copy immediately after being introduced to the game.

Finally, the game gets special bonus for having John Henry on the cover in the company of two tiny white men.

Steel Driver is another game, presumably of a new series, that takes inspiration from the Prairie Railroads series which also spawned Wabash Cannonball and its ilk. In returning to this basic idea, Wallace has come up with some changes to the system that radically impact the focus and play of the basic idea of buy stocks in companies, lay rail for them, collect income.

In SD, players are given X resource cubes per round which are used in an auction to buy stocks in the 6 companies. Each of the 6 has one stock issued each round, and the cubes bid are put into their kitties to buy track. In SD, connecting to cities gives one time VPs for the player doing the building which is one way to score points. The other is the incredibly involved and game-swinging end game where the players with overall control of each company take turns drafting goods cubes off the board to try and form sets for each company. Having larger sets of unlike cubes is the key, and this is made more difficult by the rarity of certain cube types, along with the geographical specificity of the 2 out of the 3 rarest ones. These sets are the major scoring component, as they can score 10 to over 100 VPs each (4 different of 5 types in one set) for each individual stock sold for that company. This importance means that most of the game prior is about positioning companies for the cube grab at the end of the game, and about taking control of companies where the other potential majority stock holder has interests that conflict with your own.

My take? It's not bad, it's an enjoyable enough game. I have played pretty much everything that has come from this lineage though, and I like the alliance based, economic, grinding games more, particularly the last two prairie games: Pampas and Veld. In the time frame this takes (1hr20?) I would much rather play 2 games of Wabash, which keeps the alliance focus of the original series. SD is much more of a solo optimization game than the other members of this extended family, and I think it suffers as a result, but I think part of that is just my personal bias because of how much I have enjoyed the more alliance focused titles. The only other game of this vague lineage that is a solo oriented game is Gulf, and it is considerably heavier because of its cash economy, cube tracks, and other factors. Steel Driver does have a different hook to potentially make up for this: the end game cube grab, and while this is certainly different, and drives a lot of the action in the game, I simply didn't care for it, your mileage may vary. 

The idea I actually find most interesting here is the closed economy. By having players bid in cubes which are handed out at a finite rate (but which may be stored from round to round), Martin has fixed one of the potential runaway problems that a cash-based economy can create. This can create some interesting tension and I hope to see this back in future incarnations of this particular branch of the family tree.

Those without exposure to the other games of this lineage will likely find this an enjoyable enough experience, as will those who like medium to medium-light games. I would concur with that, decent, just not remarkable. After my initial 2 plays, I don't see a scenario in which I would volunteer this over any of its siblings. This means I might be being a bit generous handing this a 4 instead of something lower, but the game really is inoffensive and has some interesting decisions, it just pales in comparison to the numerous other games that it is related to, which means I am much less interested in playing it than I would be otherwise. I would always volunteer other games that are similar in place of this.

Steel Driver is an oddity amongst train games on the US map. It looks like it is composed of two parts, one stock and one pick-up-and-deliver. But upon playing you quickly learn that the two parts are welded much tighter than you'd suspect at first. Difficult as it is, the stock part must be played with the future PUAD in mind to the point where matters might even become too opaque for the game's own good. But I have a strong hunch that with more experience players will be able to develop a feeling for the value of the various aspects of the game, and play it better as a consequence: there are games where this coupling is many orders of magnitude more complex, and people manage just fine after a while. This is, by the way, the commonest complaint you'll see filed against this game: that the endgame feels 'off'. It arrives too sudden, its influence is too big, or uncertain, ... . All variations on the same theme. You won't hear me saying that there [i]isn't[/i] a grain of truth in these comments: the endgame [i]is[/i] a difficult aspect of Steel Driver, and I make no claim to understanding it. But there is a clear lure of control here, and that makes me coming back for more. 

What I also like about the game is its minimalistic appearance. It was a member of Martin Wallace's ill-fated old-style Treefrog project: to create games which apart from a board contained only wooden pieces. Steel Driver also contains paper money, but Martin countered that this is also a form a wood. I consider that statement a little gamey, but as the money is merely a means to keep score, I'm inclined to forgive him. In any case, for the €10 I paid for this game (German publisher Pegasus was dumping its stock) this for the moment appears to be a solid title I look forward to exploring more of.

Nothing wrong with the game, but other games use a similar system are and are more fun. Update: I was wrong, the "goods delivery" phase of the games is rather uninteresting and reduces the suspense of the game, I'd prefer to score cities based upon how many different colors which they connect.

A brilliant train/auction game.

I enjoyed trying to predict which companies would soar in value or simply trying to attain a majority shareholding position.

Though there's completely open information and no randomness, the many viable strategies and the human factor in game with over 2 players means that getting bogged down in details wasn't an issue. There were enough overt choices to make that I felt there was enough to do on the surface, without worrying about every possible permutation.

I can imagine having great fun trying out different strategies and there's a sense of ownership as you develop 'your' company and screw others

I think it's best to try and attain as many majorities as possible. With only one share in each company, you can only hope to do averagely, I think.

To me, it's what happens to Wabash when Martin says "I can do better."  I like having dividends separated from the thing you're using to bid for control of companies (my least favorite element of Wabash).  But Martin might want to seek a bit more help in the art direction side of things, as even my gay friends find the cover to be too gay...

Company train game, not build train game.

An interesting, but obtuse auction game. The end of game scoring is almost impossible to work out in advance - companies touching lots of areas can still be near worthless if thier rarer cubes are pinched by the other lines. That means its often just better to chase lots of shares and earn the most you can each turn. That's worked well for me.
The auctions are tense and tricky with such coarse currency, but after that there's not much to it.

Mediocre game. Didn't feel like you did a lot of meaningful choices during the game.

Rail game where you buy shares.  When you buy shares you get to build rail for that turn for that railroad. At the end of the game you pick up cubes for regions that you are in.  Those cubes become the basis for your score.  That times number of shares + money accumluated.

Turn order is really important on the "cube pickup" turn since this is where the most points come from.  In a six player game, you must not miss picking up a share.  It is really unforgiving in that regard.  So a player can put an unwanted share up for bid, sometimes get it for cheap and still get another.  This happens because the other players must wait out the turn to get on the good share so that another player doesn't get it cheap.  This method of bidding is wonky and keeps me from rating the game higher.

Players are railway investors, overseeing the construction of early railways across the United States.  Players are alloted a set amount of investment cubes each turn, which are used to bid for a share in one or more railway companies that turn.  Winning the bids gives the player control over construction for that turn, as well as injects capital into the company to pay for construction costs.  Then, the controlling players for that turn take turns building track links across the map with their companies, earning instant payoffs for connecting cities (with a bonus for completing the transcontinental railroad).  Repeat over five turns, then play out the end game... cubes are sprinkled across the map and majority shareholders in each company get to take turns grabbing cubes from linked cities.  The larger the set of different coloured cubes, the higher the share prices will be per share at the end of the game.  Very interesting game, only takes 60 minutes to play, very simple to teach, but quite deep.  I found it difficult to assess what the correct thing to do was... I could see what I had to do, but didn't feel I had any control over doing it!  Definitely need to revisit to see if it's a game, or just a set of random mechanics.  Certainly fun and plays well, but the jury out... so a cautious 7.

I very much like the emergent alliances created by the share distribution mechanic. It encourages people not to over-commit to a single rail as then everyone else will be motivated to screw it.

I found the final share value evaluation to be opaque, mostly because it was difficult to parse the board. When I could clearly see who could access what, it was not hard to look down the decision tree and choose which cube to take. However, I gave up 120 points in the end-game scoring in the one game I played due to mis-parsing the board.

Steel Driver is a quick, no-luck, stock train game.  In this regard it succeeds.  It's not overly complex but offers a decent amount of strategy.  I really like that it uses wooden bits for shares and 'money'.  I would have preferred a point track around the board than paper money that's used to keep track of victory points.  The main issue I have with the game is the cube grab end game.  Throughout the game you can focus on well paying connections or setting up for the end game.  The only problem with the end game is that even if you have set various train companies to get good cubes early on, you can't predict what the cube grab order will be at the end of the game.  Thus even if you have spent a lot of effort to get a company you have a lot of shares in to get good diverse cubes you still may not even be able to grab them.  Chicago Express replaced Steel Driver in my opinion.

While it's opaque at first as to what to prioritize and how the endgame plays out, the more you understand the long-term consequences, the more interesting and deep the game becomes. The game play itself is pretty straightforward. You spend most of the game laying track and only collect cubes at the very end. You all bid for control of companies over 5 turns and balance going for lucrative routes that pay out now vs routes that connect this company to a city with a cube. There are different color cubes (some rarer than others), and you want the companies you invest in to have access to as many different colors as possible for the endgame cube grab.

Of course, so does everyone else so you're pitted against each other from turn to turn. Each time you win the bid for company control, you get a share of stock (up to 5 total/co.). At the end of the game after all the companies have grabbed cubes, you determine the value of those shares and pay out to each stock owner. This money is added to the money you collected from in-game track payouts.

The trick of the game is that you may not control the same company(ies) each turn, and the values of the train companies are determined over the course of the game as people lay track (for short-term vs long-term benefit(, so it's nowhere obvious as to what the final values will be. The endgame cube is a bit mind-bending for first-time players and should be explained in as much detail as possible up front.

This tactical game feels slightly lighter than the similar Chicago Express.  There are enough things going on, and enough information to process to make it feel like it's fairly difficult to control what's going on, but it's still very interesting.  This game has a rather unique climax for its final round where goods are placed on the board and then snapped up by the various companies in play for a final round of scoring.  It's fairly simple to learn, but will probably take at least a full game before the strategy becomes clear.

I like the clean, almost abstract, mechanism. Most unusual in a train game (although this is mostly a market game). The net result is a much shorter play time. On the down side, you lose some of the "epic feeling" of longer train games. I guess it fills some niche since short train games are rare... Also, on the downside, handling the money is quite fiddly and error-prone.

RATING: 6
One of the lighter train games that may be a suitable candidate for introducing people to the genre before moving on to the cutthroat meatier games. The selling point of Steel Driver, I think, is that there is a stark contrast when building rails between short-term point grabs that benefit you immediately, and long-term network development that ultimately pays off for all share holders. The final scoring is a bit odd but certainly rewards careful route management and wise investment decisions.

A good game that was published at the same time than Chicago Express/Wabash Cannonball. Chicago received a lot of good critics and is a top 100 already and Steel Driver was critized, as many people claimed that it is too chaotic. But life is a matter of taste and I enjoy Steel Driver more than Chicago Express. Pay a lot of attention in the explanation, since if the players dont understand the rules of the cubes collection and the end of the game, they wont play it correctly and may be they wont like it.

Six plays overall—two with three, three with four and one with five. It's a slimmed-down version of the Prairie Railroads games, but not a wholly successful one, I think. The final scoring phase is simply too unpredictable; the map is quite open, with central cities having five, six or even seven outlets, and so all the rail lines will criss-cross and intersect, making it very hard to visualize how the goods cube  selection will play out. 

However, having said all that I do still enjoy the game. There's lots to think about, and things can move along quite quickly if the players are experienced. I can live with the fact that the final outcome is usually a surprise, since the game is very entertaining up to that point.

Rating after one 4player game (rating may change after repeated plays).

A great little train game that is rather light considering that it is an offering by Martin Wallace.  Completely language independent, which makes it especially good in Indonesia.  The gameplay dynamics between auctions, investments, and short-term gains are fun to balance and in total it is a very fun game!

I was expecting something heavier for some reason, but I liked it anyway. It seemed like an odd mix between TransAmerica and Power Grid, if that makes any sense. Players pay to complete routes across America, while gaining shares in the RR companies. At the end, those shares are valued based on the commodities earned. Definitely worth another play.

I had no idea what I was doing until near the end, when it turned out that I'd actually won. I imagine there must be strategy involved but it seemed like the first part of the game was very much detached from the end game scoring and it could be a bit of luck that determines the winner.

RATING: 7
This one looks almost as if it wasn't Wallace's design. It is extremely elegant with the gameplay flowing seamlessly.

But still it has the Wallace's feel by which I mean it is not a straightforward eurogame in which you would follow the obvious strategy yielding you the win. In this game, at first, you have to wrap your mind around the fact that actually you do not own anything, you just control it whereas possession itself is spread among players. It gives that weird 'by helping me, I help them' feeling and requires really careful planning, particularly in the second half of the game.

It is Wallace's one of best.

The rate is 8.8 as of 20th July 2009. I expect it to go up.

22nd August 2009: I am updating my rates so that they would be in compliance with BGG rating scale. Rate down to 8.

For first time ever I got to play one of Martin's published games as a totally 'green' player and without someone else who had played before. Including reading and explaining the rules we had a very enjoyable game and all in all it took less than 1 hour!!

I rarely like Martin Wallace and I rarely like train games.  For some reason, this one clicked and I enjoyed it.  I prefer it to Railroad Tycoon, even though the bits here suck.  The rules to Steel Driver make better sense and it plays faster than a lot of other train games.  The auction order was a little odd, but didn't really effect the outcome of the game.  I underestimated the scoring effect of the cubes and concentrated on scoring a lot during the building turns.  The cube strategy seemed better, but obviously an experienced player will be able to pursue both successfully.  The game is fast for how deep it is and the combination of stock purchasing, track laying, and cube collection makes it pretty varied.  Martin Wallace usually bores me in the midgame, but this seemed pretty exciting throughout.

An ok network building/stock taking game. It's not very intuitive though... seems like the majority stock holder should have more say in the development of the company than whoever bought the last share. Kooky. Also, it takes a couple plays for the end scoring to sink in.

This game reminds me of a less sophisticated and less complex Acquire.  Like Acquire, there is a stock element to Steel Driver and you have to pick the train lines that will be worth the most at the end of the game.  You build up your train connections and try to make your lines worth more.  But, Steel Driver lacks the merger type element of Acquire and has a very simplistic stock system.  It's a nice game, but I would rather play Acquire.

There is a bit of abstraction here that makes this game harder to grasp (At least for me) than other games very similar to it.

After a few plays, I'm cooling off a bit.  It seems that there is a strong strategy for just paying a lot for a single share to drive a company forward strong.  Other people will bid high on it later and ensure the value of the shares you've acquired.

Martin Wallace has a long history of designing train games and it shows, as this game is considerably more polished in its initial release than his usual efforts. It's a fairly abstract business game with much swapping of company ownership, but some tough decisions along the way, especially in the area of how much to bid and how much to save for the next round. It's certainly a better game than Wabash Cannonball that's for sure.

RATING: 7
Ummm.. this is odd.  Players bid on stocks every turn; the player who most recently bought stock runs the company.  It's hard to know from the beginning whether you want to nourish or sabotage the company you are running.  Majority per se is a very small benefit, though of course it carries more money with it at the end.  It's hard to tell who's doing well and who isn't.  On the whole, the game is a very odd and rather stressful--but short.  I don't know.  Will have to play again. (1 play)

I can't help but compare this to Chicago Express, but it felt lighter to me, in a good way I think. The fact that you're using a separate currency from VPs when bidding seemed to make the game require less intense calculation. There also seems to be a chaos factor to the final scoring, which might frustrate some but I think also makes the game less deterministic. Want to play again but doubt I'll buy -- I just have a lot of games that are like this.

Disappointment to me as a fan of Wallace's earlier designs.  This game works ok, but it's boring and the final impact of different actions is very similar (similar scores of players during and at the end of the game).
  The game brings no excitement, in fact it's wiped out of any emotions.

Control of the final cube collection by railroad companies is non-existent (or requires an analysis almost as long as the whole game...).  And this collection makes up over 60% of your score...

Sold.

I have mixed feelings about SD.  It's ok as a light fairly quick game but some parts are a little too abstracted for me.  I don't like that bidding cubes have nothing to do with your money. I don't like the shares mechanism that only plays out at the end.  I don't like the profit method that your railroad income doesn't grow and the control of profits for each railroad only goes to one each turn -- and not necessarily the one that has the most shares.  It's like 2 different games -- a train game in the beginning that all of a sudden changes into a set collection/area majority thing.  I'd rather play just about any Winsome game over it.  There is a decent game in there but just not my type of game.

RATING: 6.3
The game is pretty good, at least until you get to the end.  I just don't like how your entire game can get shut down if you can't grab a few cubes at the end. It just feels too random to me. It's very important that you go first, or at least early, in the final round so that you can grab the important cubes.

A little lighter than the usual Martin Wallace fare, but an excellent game nonetheless.  Players own shares in companies rather than each running their own company, so it's a bit similar to 18xx in that regards, but nowhere near the complexity of 18xx.  On your first play it's tough to see exactly how the end-game scoring is going to roll out, but I think did a pretty good job of it.  Our first play was with 5.  With 6 company shares up for grabs each turn, someone was going to get two, which added some strategy to the bidding.

RATING: 5.1
Big disappointment; I'm a huge Wallace fan. Steel Driver plays fairly quickly and plays 6, but that's where the plusses end. It lacks continuity and any sort of personal investment with what's happening on and off the board. Minimal tension.

I realize this is supposed to be light and quick, but it's actually too long for what it is.

RATING: 7
Like this a lot but doesn't always go down well at the table. The main game seems very simple but it all counts towards the endgame score in a rather obtuse way, and I think this is very offputting on first play. Subsequent plays make the endgame assume the proper significance and thus significantly changes the main game dynamics. One best to play with other seasoned players, definitely, as it needs at least one full play under a newbs belt for them to 'get' it.

RATING: 8.5
Like some critics, I was initially put off by the endgame cube grab, which seemed chaotic and a bit random, but I've come to enjoy that aspect most of all.  The distribution of colors encourages you to spread out, and just getting points for connections (as some variants propose) would do that.  But the cube-grab makes you think like a rail baron.  Just connecting to Mobile, for example, isn't enough.  If you want to be sure you get the cube and the accompanying "profits" in the endgame, you either need to block other railroads from connecting, control any others that do connect, or pay very close attention in the last turn to where the railroads come out in the turn order.  This last aspect may seem a bit "gamey," but it works because it creates interesting decisions.  If you're in that position, it's only because you probably chose not to establish a "monopoly" into that city when you had the chance.  Another example.  In one game, blue had the northeast corridor into Boston, and gray had a line running from Chicago up to Buffalo.  The player ahead in blue had a choice to make:  build the Boston-Buffalo line to keep gray from the precious pink cube in Boston, or build New York-Buffalo to block gray from a stronger transcontinental position.  Blue opted to protect its monopoly in Boston and gray went into New York.  The blue line ended up being the most valuable railroad in the game, in part by having the guaranteed pink cube at the end, but the gray line was the eastern half of the eventual transcontinental link and scored a bonus for that.  It's delicious to see how the choice played out.

Martin Wallace is one of my favorite game designers. I love many of his games so I´m keen to try more of his stuff. After playing Steel Driver I can say I kind of like it. I need more plays to verify if it is a good game for me though.

The rules of the game are very easy to grasp and teach. You can do it under 6 minutes. Playtime is around 90 minutes.

The art is standard old Wallace, nothing exciting but functional. Components are ok.

The theme is kind of cool, but you don´t feel it through the game.

Steel Driver´s decisions aren’t complex to execute, but they have more depth that I initially thought. The game has 5 phases but you only play in phases 2 and 3. The other phases concern themselves with some upkeep and payments. In phase two players bid to control companies and to get a share of the company, knowing how much to bid isn’t obvious because the “investment cubes” you use to bid are the funds available to the company. In phase 3 players operate the companies they control. The goal of the company is to create a rail network that generate the most money and to place the company in a good position for the end of the game. After 5 rounds players will play the end of the game round in which the companies acquire goods that can generate a lot of money. 

I have never played a game like this one. Bidding is the heart of the game but knowing where to build is not obvious. Every decisions is important.

Best with 4 players but I feel the game moves quick enough that I would play with the full complement of 6 players.

My copy of the game came with 17 missing pieces and I´m not sure if the publisher will respond. In the past, when I contacted Wallace about this issue (with Liberte´s missing pieces) I never got a reply back, besides, I think the publisher is out of business but I´m not sure. I will try with Pegasus Spiele but I´m not hopeful, this is a 2008 game after all. We will see.

Bottom line, Steel Driver is a novel bidding game and I like it. I need more plays to verify if I should keep the game or not. It plays very fast and it offers a lot of deepness for such a short game. For now, I will keep it in my collection.

Fairly simple game.  Seemed to be a nice balance between trying to get as many shares as you could, grabbing the most money when you could, investing in the rail companies with the most end game potential, and putting lots of investment cubes into the companies you had the majority of shares in to get good end game points.  All non-obvious to me after one play which is a good thing.  Probably not destined to be a classic, but I will be happy to play again.

RATING: 8
Steel Driver is a train game where players invest in up to 6 rail companies, develop those companies, and then cash in their shares at the end of the game. The rules are some of the simplest for any MW game I've played. Players are given 8 "investment cubes" each turn with which to bid for control of a company. The winning bid is paid to the company box while the player gets a share and a control marker. This continues until all companies have been auctioned or everyone passes. Then comes the build phase where controlling players build track using the investment cubes from the respective company boxes. So the higher price paid for a company, the more money that company has to work with. Profits are generated by connecting cities and at the end of the turn profits are paid out to the controlling players. All profits are then reset to zero and the next turn begins. Profits really = points, as only investment cubes can be spent for acquiring shares and development. Each turn you might be controlling different companies but you keep the shares of companies you controlled in a prior turn, in this way multiple interests are at stake with each decision a controlling player makes.

Each company has 5 shares, and so there are only 5 turns in the game. At the end of the game, final share values are determined. The cities on the map are 1 of 5 colors - some colors rarer than others. After the fifth turn, cubes matching the color of the cities are placed on the board. Majority share holders then take turns collecting a cube from a city they are connected to. Cities that are connected to a number of different companies are most contested and picked first. The larger the set of different colored cubes a company can collect, the more valuable those shares are in the end.

There are so many factors to consider in this game, it sometimes feels a little out of control, even though there are absolutely no random elements.

~ Do I try to invest heavily in one company and develop it as much as possible?
~ Do I diversify to insure against a single company's success or failure?
~ Do I try to collect more shares than anybody else, knowing they will all be worth something?
~ Do I focus more on prepping my companies for the final share valuation or getting in-game profits through connections?
~ Is what I am doing helping another player more than me?

So much can change from turn to turn that these are not easy questions to answer. And the nature of what changes - share ownership, in turn profits, end game set up - create an impressive variability of outcomes.

I think it would be difficult to come up with a hard and fast strategy for this game. I know some of the game's critics don't like that aspect, but I respect it. The strategy is opaque, but if you ignore it in favor of turn-by-turn tactics you are likely to lose. This is a game where you can feel like you are doing the right thing and kicking everyone's butt from turn-to-turn but then you end up losing and don't understand how it happened. I like it.

RATING: 6
A lean, mean, stock manipulation machine. heavily end-loaded. In the short term, you bid on shares, capitalize companies, connect cities to increase profit. In the long-term, a company's network will determine access to regional goods, and the more goods a company can claim at the end of the game, the higher the final share value. This value seems chaotically determined to some players, or too significant for the overall score, or both. I'm not sure yet. Seemed to work fairly well with 3 players. Probably not as good as Wabash Cannonball, but certainly distinct enough to explore on its own. Seems simple, but I really think this one is for experienced gamers. 

Update: After a second play, I admire this game a bit more but the brain-burn from watching all the "if/thens" pushes the edge of what I can handle. Want to play with four. 

2nd Update: Steel Driver takes it out of me. I respect it, but don't enjoy it very much, making it an every-now-and-then game for me, but an interesting one to work over.

In terms of weight and length this train game's natural comparison is Wabash Cannonball (Chicago Express). After two plays I enjoy Steel Driver a bit more although I might be biased because I already won my first game which I wasn't able to in my six plays of WC so far. Steel Driver is more accessible and even in the first game you should get a grasp on what you can do to win. Understanding the consequences of the final scoring and preparing for it are essential. It is possible to get this understanding just from reading the well-written rules (an exception for Martin Wallace?).
A few thoughts on strategy: Foremost (stating the obvious), avoid other players getting more shares than you do. Endgame payout for one additional share gives a big advantage. It's not so important being in every good railroad. Just try to not invest in the one or two railroads which stay behind the rest. Try to control two railroads in the final payout. In track building rounds, lay the base for not being in the poor dog railroad rather than going for maximum payout. But don't neglect the transcontinental bonus. 30$ more or less can decide in the end.

Solid game, but nothing special.

Didn't find this very satisfying on the first play with 6. Slightly better on a subsequent play with 4, and then actually playable with 3 players when I really understood what the game was about.

When teaching this to new players, it's really important to let them know that the points you get in the final scoring are what really make or break the game. Sure, in a tight game the player who got more points during the normal rounds has an edge, but it's hard to make a dent on the huge final scoring.

Once this is understood by all,  the board play transforms from short-term optimization to ensuring that you get good value for your investment cubes at the end of the game. And then you get into interesting choices both during the operating rounds and the investment rounds.

RATING: 6
A nice complement to games like Wabash Cannonball.  Not having any experience with the Prairie Railroads family of games, this was a pleasing experience - a relatively simple game that plays pretty quickly.  With experience I don't see why this wouldn't be playable in 35 - 45 minutes.  Probably the only knock against the game is the lack of real originality.  Still, this is one that I'm looking forward to exploring further.

Update: Never really caught on with everyone in my group.  It's a pleasant game, but doesn't stand out.  If I wanted to play something like this I would probably choose Chicago Express.  I got a nice offer for this so I sold it.

My second play was with six.  Very interesting game.  My opinion goes up, and Steel Driver now merits an 8 (was 7).  I suspect the game will end up being best with 4-5 players.  Plays pretty quick, and offers enough to consider.  This is a winner.


Initial impression.  We were three, and I think the game will be even better with one more player.  The 5 rounds were easy to explain, but I struggled to clearly communicate how the endgame would work.

I like that the game can handle from 3-6 players, and seems rather brisk.  I suspect this may be a hit with the game club.

Extremely dry and static game. I guess thats kinda expected when the game has no random elements and its main mechanism is bidding with very few cubes on very few different items. 

I also don't like games where big tactical or strategic decicions have a lot to do with manipulating turn order. It just doesn't feel engaging to me.

Interesting ideas in here, but all of them don't work well enough. A game is tough, decisions aren't that obvious, which means that there might be some AP problems. For me the biggest issue is the endgame collect-the-cubes -system, which I don't like.

Steel Driver is an OK-game which I'm ready to play, but (for example) Chigaco Express is better one.

Played twice.  5 players.  Another good new Wallace game.  This is as good as I expected, but after playing, I'm actually a little surprised I liked it.  There is essentially no randomness due to game mechanics.  I usually like at least a few random elements.  I found this game very difficult, though; the strategy was hard to grasp for me.  More games may reveal more.

While this is a solid stock/train game once again by Wallace, I didn't find it nearly as dynamic or interesting as many of his earlier offerings.  It is fairly simplistic to play which makes this almost a family train game.  I suspect it will take a couple plays to figure out if there is much planning and control in trying to set up companies to do well in gathering goods in the final round.

RATING: 6
As someone who has been playing euros for more than half a decade, it's odd that I've only played one game designed by Martin Wallace, and perhaps odder still that the one game should be Steel Driver. I'm going to try not to hold this game against him.

The biggest problem is that the mechanics here don't cohere into a whole experience as well as they could. The "investment cubes" feel exceptionally gamey  both in how they are acquired and how they aren't the currency called – money – and the endgame cube claiming feels completely out of place and, coming at the end of the game, finishes things on a sour note. Add a rather flat arc for the core game, and you have an odd and mildly unpleasant gaming experience in spite of some clever design in places.

Even though they are quite far apart mechanically, it's hard not to compare Steel Driver to the brilliant Chicago Express, since they are similar in weight and playing time. The absence of informal alliances in Steel Driver stands out like a sore thumb, and CE makes the ungainly bits of Steel Driver stand out more clearly, possibly because Express has it's own odd bits (city development and the founding of Wabash) without doing damage to the overall experience. Steel Driver suffers badly in this comparison, even though it is, objectively speaking, merely a flawed design, not a terrible one.

This was one of the last Martin Wallace economic games I had left to try. I'm a huge fan of Brass and Age of Steam so I knew the game had potential to be great.

Unfortunately I didn't see the games best side because it was a 6-player game (which creates a weirdly static pattern on the bidding). Even so it was an interesting twist on the rail-building, stock game. I think I liked it better than Chicago Express/American Rails, but I need to play it again for sure.

RATING: 8
Reminiscent of games in the past where shares are auctioned, the monies bid are put in the bank of the railway, and in turn that money is used for the expansion of said railway.

Interesting elements include:

- Shares auctioned are limited to 1 per company per round
- Winner of the share each round controls the railway
- Railways must spend as much of their capital as possible
- Order of play has a subtle nuance in it's rotation

The endgame, which many might see as chaotic, though the more I think about it the more predictable it could be, is that of set collection which in turn creates the final values for stocks.

There's really quite a bit going on in a game that plays with 6 in 90 minutes or less.

As the guideline states for the 3 rating I likely won't be playing this again but I could be convinced (not very likely either).  I find these train games where I own a bit of different companies just don't peak my interest.  I enjoyed RRT and am looking forward to giving AoS a try.  I also enjoy the Rails games from Mayfair.  I just have not enjoyed these Windsome / Treefrog Martin Wallace games for some reason.  Not that they are particularly bad games but they are just not my cup of tea

One of those lightweight Wallace games that didn't get the attention that it deserved. That is probably because the game material doesn't look very sexy.

First this seems like a simple bidding/share buying game, but make sure that you learn the ins and outs of the very particular scoring mechanism that will decide on the winner. 

Definitely more than "yet another train game".

I did not enjoy this game.  Martin Wallace is a great designer, but this is not one of his better games.  

My issues with this game revolve around the chaos of it.  It's like Wabash Cannonball mushed together with Union Pacific and TransAmerica.  I like one of those three games, but the aspects of Wabash that are in this game are too diffuse. 

For the time it takes to play this, I'd rather play Wabash, Steam, or Age of Steam.

Great game with all open information.  I'm usually not a fan of auction games but the Tree Frog line is really growing on me.  I like that the auction is won with cubes and the number of cubes determine what you're capable of accomplishing in the round. The adjustment of turn order is very clever but the end game cube grab seemed little odd. More plays will help me determine if the disconnect is significant enough for me to adjust my rating.  Right now...I'm liking what I'm seeing.

I am a sucker for good economic games.  This one is no exception with his twisted scoring.  People complain that some of the connections on the map don't make sense.  To what I answer that you don't HAVE to build those connections if you don't want to.  

I agree with the fact that the scoring needs some time to grasp.  I also don't know if it's just me, but for once, I thought that the rules for this Martin Wallace game were very well laid out (compare to Brass anyway).

This is a tense little game with some mechanisms that are quite similar to Chicago Express. I much prefer the Queen production, however. Steel Driver's final round auction where someone can save their cubes from the previous round, steal the profitable company that you put all the hard work into and then proceed to remove all the wrong coloured cubes from the board so that the shares you have accumulated are next to worthless is too disheartening. I don't mind losing when I've made mistakes or someone else has played better throughout the game, but this mechanism is quite unpleasant and is difficult to mitigate against. Very Martin Wallace. On this occasion, I am not much of a fan.

In a way this game is comparable to Chicago Express: a relative 'easy' trains & stocks game, playable in an hour. 

I like Chicago Express a bit better, despite the 'scripted' starting positions that Steel Driver doesn't have. Best in this category is American Rails though.

Anyway, Steel Driver does a great job as an '18xx for Ticket to Ride players' game. And I like it.

Six companies are auctioned each round.  High bid receives a stock in that company and then later gets to use the money invested into it to build track, earning VPs for each built link.  You're trying to build a network for end-game scoring.  Each company builds one track at a time or passes.  The company that passes first gets to go first next round.  

In the last round of the game goods are put on the board, some rarer than others, and companies take turns claiming those, one at a time, that are within their network.  Points are awarded based on the goods collected and each player owning stock in that company receives that total multiplied by the number of their shares.

Unlike many recent train/stock games collusion and team-work play an almost non-existent role.  I made the mistake of sacrificing building valuable scoring links in order to try to block companies, force alliances etc.  It really doesn't pay off (at least with a full complement of players).  You want to balance building a good network (for end-game scoring), have a solid stock portfolio and take advantage of the VPs available during the tactical route building phases.  The game is a joy to play but because of the quick tactical nature but it doesn't receive a rating as high as many of the other modern train games available.

3 to 6 player railway building and stocks game. Another very elegant Martin Wallace design. Players bid for control of rail companies each turn, take a share, build track and take profit. Repeat for 5 rounds. Finish with final profit determination where the best connected railway should make the most profit, with profit split between the shareholders. Very simple rules but quite difficult to master. There is a difficult judgement to made over buying shares for short term gains each turn or investing in companies that will produce a big profit at the game end. Another winner from MW!

I bought this without trying, based on the lineage - after one game I'm glad I did, since Steel Driver seems to be a rather nice little train game, and I sure like those.

Steel Driver is also refreshingly different from its (remote) cousins Wabash Cannonball and Preußische Ostbahn. The one thing that makes the difference is the fact that you're not spending victory points to gain victory points.

So far I've played the game with five and three, and it was significantly better with five. With three, it seems everybody will buy two shares each turn, reducing the tension in the game.

I've since traded this game away, since it wasn't played at all - I found out I prefer the Winsome cousins, particularly Preußische Ostbahn.

Indifferent.

My first Martin Wallace "ho hum" game. I admire what he was trying to do in creating a railroad investment game with a very simple economy (cubes for currency, and 5 shares per railroad) and which plays in less than an hour, but the problem is that there's just not enough correlation to how people played vs. how they did in the end, especially with the coloured bonus cube payout at the end.

This is Trans america with the fun factor stripped away. Without knowing which company you will control in the final stages, the game drags as it suffers from analysis paralysis on the bidding stages. Also not actually "owning" a company also detracts from the game as there is no real need to protect one company instead of another, even despite having shares in it, as in the early rounds you only grab the shares to get the money for that round.
There are far better auction games and railway games out there.

In this railroad building game, there are 6 railroad companies, with 5 shares each. Each round, one share from each company is auctioned off. Players use auction cubes to bid. Players who won the share of that railroad can build tracks, earning profit to cities they go to. Auction cubes are resupplied for the next rounds. At the endgame, majority shareholders then remove colored cubes on the cities that the train touches. Players earn money for diversity of colored cubes and most money wins.

The mechanics are easy, but the hard part is figuring out what shares you want, and what they may be worth. It's a decent game, and engaging throughout. I've played twice with 4 players, and would be interested to see how this plays with 5 or 6 people.

Gioco di Wallace, ferroviario e di aste. La particolarità però è che malgrado queste tre caratteristiche stiamo parlando di un gioco semplice e abbastanza veloce. Le meccaniche sono immediate: si procede con un'asta per le azioni delle compagnie, una seconda fase di costruzione tratte ferroviaria ed infine una di incasso. Questo prodecimento prosegue per i 5 turni che scivolano via tranquillamente. Al termine del quinto turno si passa all'incasso dei dividendi in base al valore delle azioni possedute, quest'ultima fare assegna più guadagni di quanti incassati nei primi 5 turni di gioco, motivo per cui per vincere è opportuna una pianificazione a lungo termine e spesso la prima partita servirà per capire quale strategia adottare per le prossime sfide. Un buon gioco che si può trovare a prezzi molto ragionevoli.

A crossover of rail building and stock market, with a strong prevalence of the stock market. There are many completely different interconnected strategies and it is quite difficult to spot the best one. Very interesting the power which the president has in the last phase of the game, which can be used to favour another (your) company.
Even through it has a flavour of 18xx, it is much shorter.
According to my opinion, however, the theme is somehow lacking.

It's pleasant and fast enough to play, and has the advantage of working with 6 players without a heap of downtime. It streamlines all those classic games of buying a share, putting the purchase money into the company's treasury, and then spending the treasury money on track which will earn you victory points. You have the choice of getting a bit less VPs now so as to try and set the company up for end-game scoring (which you'll reap benefit for) or just grabbing more VP's now. Not sure how much choice there is really, because the end game scoring can so easily skew any number of ways between companies depending on turn order and who controls what on the last turn. That kind of luck seems to turn the game into an experience ride to see what happens, diminishing seemingly smart play earlier in the game. Happy to explore for a while to see further, but not emotionally investing in the result in the interim.

A solid Wallace train game. I just don't like the aspect that you can't tell whether a company is going to do well at the end before the final round. So planning is needles and it feels like a chaotic decision and not very strategic.

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: A well thought out train game. First you build up the tracks of all the companies, bidding to see who will control each color of train, then you must collect cubes based on the track placement in order to make the value of the shares increase. Both phases are critical and you need to ensure that you do well in both to earn money in each phase.

RATING: 6
This stock-based train game seems pretty unintuitive.  Each turn, one share for all six companies would be put up for auction, and players received a fixed number of auction cubes with which to bid.  Whoever won the share would get to control that company for that turn.  I found it really difficult to tell whether my actions were helping me or hurting me; it wasn't even necessarily good to win auctions for cheap because then the company wouldn't have much to work with.  It was difficult to translate the position of the rail networks to end-game scoring, so during the game it was almost impossible to tell which companies would score the best at the end.

Feels like a variant of Chicago express; Different enough to stand on its own & not as clunky as many Wallace designs. The end game is more subtle that it first appears (turn order is important going in, as is which cubes to pluck).  I should play this one more.

RATING: 6
Mechanically interesting as in each turn 6 rail companies are auctioned off (allowing a share to be taken), the bid is used to lay track to not only connect to valuable cities to push up the amount of the payout (victory points) at the end of the turn, but also to join cities of various colours within the network. 

This is because at the end of 5 turns (i.e when all 5 shares of each company have been given to the winning bidders) cubes of the same colour are placed on the relevant cities and in turn order 1 cube is removed by majority share holders connected to that coloured network. These cubes are arranged into multicoloured sets which indicates the value (victory points) of each share held.

So obviously the process feels maybe alittle convoluted mechanically with a couple of rule quirks (e.g Transcontinental route) adding to the confusion but one game should make it clear. I like that a company that invested heavily in track-laying will be going last in that process in the next turn so much like the balancing turn order in Powergrid. 

Again it is another mathematical exercise but the track laying values are small and once the cube set values are memorised it should be feel less work like. There is potential to knowingly block a network which may cause some ill feeling with the investor. Again the issue with me is that holdings are open (there is no secrets), there isn't a "fun" random element to speculate and add any uncertain tension, such as the plant mechanic in Powergrid. This is why I will prefer the more accessible and tense design of the latter over Steel Driver.

Steel Driver suffered a lot by its release coinciding with the Queen reprint of Wabash Cannonball. WC (Chicago Express) is a quicker, meaner game in the same vein and I have to say I prefer it overall. 

Steel Driver has the advantage that it is slightly more obvious to the novice what a good play is, and therefore more friendly as an introduction to stock games. It also feels more like a building game--you will connect both sides of the map, whereas in WC it is not uncommon for no company to reach Chicago. For this reason I would choose Steel Driver when playing with more casual players, and WC when playing with experienced gamers.

RATING: 6
This is a quick playing, dry-looking but satisfying game for 6. In this game, players bid over 5 rounds for control of the 6 companies. Winning the bid lets you spend your bid to lay track and collect money. At the end of the game, whoever has the most winning bids for each of the companies get to collect cubes from the board, trying to complete sets for bonus points. It's simple to play and quite elegant. In terms of the route building it's similar to [thing=117914]Milestones[/thing], and in terms of bidding for the companies, it's similar to [thing=54138]Imperial[/thing]. The thing that makes this game special is it's simplicity in delivering that experience with the short playtime and the high player count.

Not enamoured after the first play. The game was ok but after recent releases by Wallace like Brass and Tinners Trail, it seems weak in comparison. I sure do not think I would pay $60 US for this baby. As far as the train theme, quite weak. Especially for Wallace whose games usually incorporate the theme nicely. This could have been called connect the dots just as easily. Maybe I missed something on the first play, so am willing to give it another shot.

RATING: 5
It does have several of the elements of Prairie Railroads, which has been rationalized. It is much more of turn/turn order driven game compared to its predecessor. 

It consists of 5 rounds where where each company is auctioned, build track and score for the auction winner. The scoring for each round is independent.

Each player gets the the same amount of investment which is bid to the company and used to build track, unlike prairie railroads is not valued in scoring.
A final scoring round has the person with the most shares collecting "goods" cubes to get scoring sets for a final scoring to each share owner of the company.

It is balanced - perhaps too balanced - the game is won on the margins with the trade off between short term (connect the cities) and the long term (having shares in the end of game payout).

I want to play this again. That's a good sign. The problem is that twice now, the person who won had no clue that they were winning (and kept saying things like "can you tell me what a cube set is again?"), and I--coming in a close second both times--had no idea either. In the second game I clearly saw what my error was in handling a company that I had the majority stake in, but I don't know how I could have easily determined the better course of action from the board potition in the 5th round. The determination of turn order in the fifth round brings about fairly wide swings in share prices in the end-game delivery phase. The end game seems very difficult to predict within a useful range that would make the attempt worthwhile. Still would like to play a few more times since the design is very elegant and easy to understand once you get over the cube set business.

--Oct2015-- I'm increasingly believing there's a serious game here.  The end game (that I'd found so difficult to visualize in my first play) seemed rather tractable in my last play.

Really taken with this game - having now played Chicago Express but none of the other 13,000 similar train games, I'm unsure whether this would remain a favourite. Clever play though, and fast. The less than flashy components do have the worthy advantage (over CE) of being less distracting, easier to absorb information from. 'John Henry' cover has to be a bonus, even if it isn't reflected at all in the game play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple rules and elegant design makes me prefer this over Chicago Express. Sure it's not very deep, but there's some good decisions to be made, risks to be taken and some clever options to consider. I really like the balance of the end scoring in terms of the overall score. You're looking for a good end game turn order to get one of the vital red cubes, insuring yourself with the other goods to get a good spread, and the ultimate is the secure goods pickup as the only rail line into that city. To set all this up you're going to give away some immediate victory points by going into cheaper cities. Wrap this all around a simple auction that doesn't take over the game and make it into just an auction game (like Chicago Express), and I like. Looking forward to future plays.

Oh, and it plays well with six - a real bonus in my book.

Surely the least objectionable train game I've experienced post-Age of Steam (now supplanted by Chicago Express).  

Short and lacks the silliness of transporting goods non-stop.  But then makes the endgame occasionally pointless for players who don't have majority control of a company.  And surely it's not a good thing that in my one game there were two people who did NOTHING in the last phase placed 1 and 2 (me 2).

Nagyon kellemes meglepetés volt a Steel Driver. Százszor elővett téma, vasútépítés a XIX. század Amerikájában. A játékosok vasúttársaságokba fektetnek be és próbálják a legjobban vezetni őket a meggazdagodás felé jó sínfektetéssel. Az eddig megismert játékokhoz képest minden újdonsága kimondottan tetszett a Steel Drivernek. Először is a pénz külön működik a befektetési kockák mellett. Tehát ebben a játékban nem saját pénzből, hanem körönként kapott befektetési jelzőkkel szerzünk részvényeket a társaságokból. Így az egyik AP veszélyes elem, hogy mennyit fektessek be teljesen hiányzik a játékból, mégis semmi kisebb mélységet nem éreztem emiatt. A játék utolsó körében előjövő áruszerzési rész pedig nagyot dob a játékon, igaz itt az addig szerzett pénzünknél nagyobbat lehet szakítani így lehet mondani, hogy a játék végéig semmit nem lehet látni ki hogy áll nekem kimondottan tetszett és jó csavart ad a játéknak. Ez amúgy tényleg lehet kis negatívum, de talán majd 1-2 játék után ezt jobban meg lehet ítélni. Egyáltalán nem vészesen hosszú a SD 3-an is tökéletesen működött, nekem eddig a részvényes játékok között talán ez tetszett a legjobban, az Imperial érdemeit nem elfelejtve. Azért csak 7-es, mert alapvetően nem az én világom a részvények.

This is a nice lighter train game.  Not as light on its feet as Wabash,  but it certainly feels like it packs a bit more punch.  It is hard not to compare the two games as they both clearly are derived from the same "Rails" series games.  It certainly plays differently enough from the original series to justify the purchase (as well as looking great).  

Lots of compelling decisions.  It is a little bit more of a free formed track-laying stock game, where the constraints are trackable.  Very nice.  I highly recommend it.

Similar in many ways to Chicago Express, but with some complicating twists that make it worth exploring more. 

Lowered 7->5 because I bought it to play with six players, and it truly sucks with six. Inevitably one or two companies get encircled in New England, rendering them utterly worthless for the rest of the game. Players then have to save cubes to up their bids for the companies that are still viable. Complete crap for six, and probably not great for five.

RATING: 6
After playing Chicago Express, I think it's impossible to not compare the two and CE definitely wins out. I like the cleanness of CE. Money is money and is used like money. In SD, money is victory points but you play the game with "investment cubes" that are replenished by 7 each round. I like the thematic elements of CE like the progress of industrialism, the westward expansion, the cost for expanding into different types of terrain, and the bonuses for reaching Chicago and opening up the Wabash. I don't like the set collection of cubes at the end of SD; if you squint really hard you can make some kind of a case for it being related to the railroads sprawling network, but it just doesn't do it for me. So in the end, I would play SD again, but it would be a weird set of circumstances where I didn't find something else to play. And all of this is written by someone who is terrible at CE and gets worse every time he plays it!

A great game, 18xx style for civil play durations! Recommended! Also, this is an auction game! This time you will not want to get everything for super cheap though.

Quite a brain burner! Anticipating what the different companies will do on the map and drawing the right conclusions for bidding can be quite a task! Always keep in mind which company goes first.

The rules are not difficult or long, but the game is a brain burner nevertheless!!


In the meantime, I found Chicago Express does a better, more straightforward job on scaling the 18xx games down into a 2h game! Compared to CE, SD feels quite complicated for no obvious function.

A nice, simple train game in the same family as Wabash Cannonball/Pampas Railroads -- like those, this has a light 18xx feel (owning shares of companies, building networks). You have to balance short-term gain (income from making connections) with long-term gain (collecting shares in companies, and building connections that will create value at the end of the game). The twist is that in this game, company control can change every turn regardless of total number of shares any player may own. The game plays quickly but has a lot of interesting decisions ... probably a Wabash Cannonball killer for me?

Most of the game is spent building track: each of 5 turns starts with players getting cubes with which to bid for control of company(s), as well as a non-voting share of the controlled company. The companies then use the spent cubes to build track -- a nice, simple way to represent large amounts of capital. Each city added to the network earns the controlling player money (=VP; money isn't actually spent in this game).

The last part of the game is like the Move Goods phases of Age of Steam, all done at once! Cubes are placed on the board, then companies (in turn order) collect them and create sets (= cubes of differing colors) whose value increases with size. Each share of a company pays the value of the sum of the company's sets of cubes ... simply a brilliant way to value a rail network quickly and easily! The players receive their payouts; whoever has the most money wins!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like how the different aspects of the game are all tightly interrelated and how there are several factors to consider with each decision, both short-term and long-term.  For a game this deep, the rules are surprisingly easy to learn and it also plays faster than I expected.  One strategy hint:  try not to end the game with seven white cubes remaining!

I think this is a good game although it takes a bit too much time. Everything is very well balanced and although it could seem that someone is on the lead, nobody can call for victory until the final scoring. 

Bidding is the core part of Steel Driver and if a players does well on that he could manage to win more often.

Although I still like it, this is so far, my least favorite Wallace game.  The fact that it still rates a 7 indicates how much I like his games!  The lack of any kind of random element, but wide board positioning, causes some AP in the last couple rounds as you must balance trying to compete or deny cargo color to the obvious leader and increasing the score for a stock in which you might have more interest.

Like many Wallace games typically someone who is effectively second in most or all of the stocks will win.

Although completely different in both play and theme, the game itself feels much like Tyros--but I like Tyros better with it's slightly randomized board/civ tiles

There are 6 railroad companies that all players share control of over different times. You auction for control of each line. Gaining control provides a share and allows you to control the route. The end game is very different, where each node on the map is seeded with a representative cube of various colors. The game switches to set collection where the final value of the shares is increased by have a diverse set of goods. The controller of each rail line picks for cubes one at a time in turn order. After the value of each rail company share is determined all players cash our their shares and the most money wins. Very good game.

Tremendous game where the players vie for control of 6 different rail lines and balance short term gains versus long term rewards.  The auction is impactful in gaining shares and manipulating turn order.  Then the end game switches to a set collection of goods to determine the value of each of the train company shares.  Not a lot of rules but there are some meaty decisions to make.

Interesting. I looks like a "standard easy train game", but it`s more. It`s not important how much you earn at each round, it`s important to have many shares in companys, that would have high value, because at the end of the game you get much more, than during the 5 rounds.

Though the whole goods/set collection thing to value the companies at the end is a bit strange, this game does shine a bit. I dropped it to a 7 though - I just enjoy similar games like Chicago Express more.

RATING: 6
Steel Driver features a very tricky balancing act of speculating on the values of the companies before the game ends, and trying to set the companies up in your favor.  And yet the values of the companies can vary so wildly right at the end of the game, that I don't think I'll ever be able to figure that out.

RATING: 8
A bidding, route-connection and stock-acquisition game that is pretty light/short compared with many other Wallace designs. Steel Driver is a tight design where all the mechanics mesh well into one another, and the game is tense from start to finish. Whether you look at it as a meaty game that plays quickly or a quick game with some meat on its bones, it hits a sweet spot in terms of game length and complexity for me. I'm typically not a fan of stock or route-building games, but this one is a cut above.

Steel Driver is my favorite of the new Treefrog games so far. It’s an interesting train game, but doesn’t quite measure up to Chicago Express in my mind, particularly in terms of packing a lot of game into a little time, which Chicago Express does masterfully. Steel Driver is similar to Chicago Express in that the game revolves around auctions for shares in train companies, which pay dividends and effectively pay victory points based on your percentage ownership in a company. In addition, the train companies start with no routes when you begin both of these games and the companies slowly expand to cover the map over the course of these games. So they’re not only about bidding the right amount on the right shares, but also about expanding the train companies that you’ve invested in to reach the best cities on the map given the circumstances. There are two things that keep Steel Driver from being as good as Chicago Express in my mind. First is the playing time, which was only 60 minutes for Chicago Express, but was close to 2 hours for Steel Driver. This could potentially be rectified with repeated plays, but Steel Driver certainly isn’t quite as streamlined as Chicago Express, which is not surprising given that it’s a Martin Wallace game. Then again, the charm of Wallace games is often in their clunkiness and convoluted nature. Second is the end game of Steel Driver, which feels tacked on and feels like it somewhat arbitrarily determines the results of the game. While both games determine the winner by calculating who has the most money at the end of the game, Chicago Express doesn’t have any different ways to earn money at the end of the game; the shares simply pay dividends based on the income of the railroads. Steel Driver, on the other hand, adds a new wrinkle at the end that seems to overwhelm everything that came before. While the players earn income during the game, the railroads collect colored cubes from the cities that they’ve reached in Steel Driver and then pay out based on the variety of colored cubes collected at the end of the game. This is good because it encourages players to develop sprawling railroads, so they come into conflict with each other as they expand their networks, but it’s bad because the selection of cubes at the end of the game feels fairly disassociated with the majority of the gameplay. So you play for an hour and 45 minutes, then spend 10 minutes picking cubes off the board to determine the final payouts and the winner. The disjunction was a bit off-putting. I’ll gladly try Steel Driver again, but given the fact that it costs twice as much as Chicago Express and my first impression didn’t excite me in the same way, I’ll hold off on picking up a copy for the time being.

[thing=37387][/thing] is one more game in the path of Martin Wallace in his quest to make a quicker and simpler - yet thoughtful and deep - version of a 18xx game. [thing=37387][/thing] isn't the final answer, but is quite there.

The idea is: in each of the five rounds, players will bid with cubes for control (and a share) of the six train companies. The cubes will be used, by the person controlling the company in that round, to build tracks - at the end of the round, players will receive money (which are the victory points - they aren't used to bid) depending on the connections made in that round by the companies they control.

At the end of the game, the person with the most shares of a company will be able to get coloured cubes around the board (that touch the tracks of the company) in order to access the final value of the company - then they will pay the amount worth for each share. The person the with the money points will be the winner.

[thing=37387][/thing] gives a lot while demanding little - the experience requires a good deal of planning and execution, from the get go, as the first bids and positioning of the starting places for the companies lay a path for them during the whole play. Yet, it is easy to learn and teach, and a full game can happen in around one hour to 90 minutes. The bids are a nice mechanic - although not innovative - that coupled with the need and desire to make money right now, alongside the necessity to make your shares more valuable in the end game, creates a lot to think about - not only for yourself, but since the cubes that decide the worth of each company are disputed by them, positioning is key both to gain as to deny to the others.

Overall, [thing=37387][/thing] provides very well a short 18xx experience - the feel is there, even in the more nasty ways, with blocking and denial in order to crash the value of a company. The share system is bare and simple, but is relevant in the end game. Play is lively and  with small downtime, since the bids can go all that high (cubes to bid are limited) and once it is done, often the path to use the cubes is already done in the mind of the controller, meaning the next phase usually goes quite fast. [thing=37387][/thing] does have a drab look, but is far from the ugliest coming from Wallace, though the paper money is as cheap and bad as it can get. Still, the game has strong mechanics, a good pace, is clever and give a lot of choices while keeping itself lean and effective. Recommended.

First impression was not good but I came around somewhat. There are six railroads with five shares each, and on each of five rounds one share for each railroad is auctioned off. Players bid on shares using light blue investment cubes; they have a fixed income of these cubes with no way to increase it. The railroads also use these cubes to pay for track builds.

This felt dissatisfying because the railroads rarely seemed very different in value, and a round's income is only good for building about two links on the board. Bid too little and you won't be able to build; bid too much and... well, you hardly [i]can[/i]. Felt a bit like auctioning off undifferentiated sodas to kids who have no more than a dollar or two to spend.

The final value of the railroads' shares is determined by a weird endgame scoring procedure where cubes (corresponding to the the color and thus region of the city they're on) are claimed in turn by the railroad presidents basically. Try to grab the most contested cubes first (because you want to build sets of different colors) and keep safe ones for later. It's strange. Not unpleasant but quite hard to plan for in advance of this procedure occurring.

I did realize eventually that there were six railroads going up for auction each turn and only four players. It's generally better to have more shares, even if you can't capitalize very well the railroads you invest in. So you can try to bid low enough to be able to get a second share. That's a pretty tactical game to play but I didn't find it dull.

The simplicity of the game was appealing.

After several games, I think 7 is about the right rating. A faster take on the "prairie" series is an excellent idea, and I like a lot of what this does, but it doesn't quite get up to 8 level for me. Still a game I am pleased to own and play. ETA: I'd still be willing to play it, but I haven't played it in some time and haven't really missed it.

Not bad, but I'm slightly worried that the end game is A) too random (too hard to figure out what will happen), B) very important. In our game, the end game payout was something like 70% of the whole income during the game. 

Also, it is interesting that the game is quite tactical and almost the only strategy comes what shares you want to have at the end of the game. But again, what shares are the best ones, is not very easy to figure out..

Based on one play.  I enjoyed the game but in comparison to Wabash Cannonball (Chicago Express) I found this one to be less engaging for me. Most of the rail games take several plays for me to really get a feel for what things are worth when bidding, so I suspect this is a game that would benefit from repeat playings.

RATING: 6
The unthinkable has finally happened! Martin Wallace actually designed an elegant game. You won't find any overwrought mechanics here. Which is great- I like the ideas in Martin's games but the egregious exceptions to rules and superfluous bells and whistles really irk me sometimes. 

Steel Driver is first and foremost a stock game, and almost everything that happens during the game is a setup for an end-game destination cube collection that determines the value of stocks. Each turn players get a fixed income of resource cubes to bid on controlling the different companies. Winning a bid means you get a stock in that company as well as decide where the company expands this turn. One twist is that the funds for expansion are actually the same resources that you bid to take control, so a higher bid means more funds. The bigger the network that a company has at the end of the game, the more destination cubes it will likely pick up during the end-game collection. Of course some destinations are better than others, which spikes the interest of the mechanic. 

I like this game. Unsure yet if it really has the depth that would make it a favorite, but in the meantime I'd like to play some more.

Yet another train game...the bits could almost fool you into thinking you're playing Transamerica.  The "goods" are coloured cubes...and the "money" you bid with ... are white cubes.  And the shares are coloured discs.   The train company control markers are surprisingly awesome though.  Paper money (VPs) was multi-coloured (good) but otherwise not memorable.  Map makes me think that it's a canvas map that someone forgot to colour.  The ocean looks OK.

Actually,  turns out to be yet another railroad game.  There's bidding for control,  and then using the money paid into the company for expansion (reminds me a bit of the backend for Imperial, except building railroads rather than conquest).  There's definitely opportunity for screwage - we managed to box in one colour on the first turn!

Endgame plays out as a set collecting cube-grabbing minigame,  which feels a bit tacked on - feels like we're solving the designer's "who gets which goods cube" problem.

Game plays very quickly.  A solid economic train game...probably would have made a better impression on me if the entire theme wasn't a complete snore.

Played again,  and now playing rearranging companies by passing order adds a nice additional dimension.  Still unsure whether the endgame obtuseness is a plus or a minus.

Thought: It might have been more interesting to have the cube delivery part integrated into the "main game" - have them collected during the game, rather than in a separate endgame phase.  But maybe that would make it too much "Age of Microsteam"

It does play refreshingly quickly (at least with 3).  And comments here show that 3 is not the best number for this game.

It's games like this that remind me why I'll never be a member of the Wallace-of-the-month mail order club.

For quite some time, I've been rating his releases a 6 or 7 (recognizing some value in these games at the time of play), but then my interest in ever playing again evaporates after 72 hours.  How's that for a short shelf life.

Members of this disreputable club: Steel Driver, Tinners' Trail, After the Flood, Automobile, and Last Train to Wensleydale.

I've even noticed that, when someone gears up to suggest one of these game, I inwardly cringe.  Go with your gut, I say - but the ratings still stand.

Played once (with 5 players). An interesting game with lots of clever ideas. However, I am worried it might be difficult to really evaluate what is going on (especially the final scoring, which seems so disconnected from the rest of the game - and yet every company managed to score roughly the same in the end). Five players might be too much for this game, and I suspect it would be easier to follow what is happening with fewer (also, with 4, not everyone would end up with the same total number of shares). I am curious to play it with 3 or 4, and also to see how much the past experience can help me in planning.

As a whole Steel Driver is a fairly pedestrian auction-driven connections game that really has nothing unique to claim its own.  It is a conglomeration of familiar mechanics we've seen elsewhere before.  The only thing that I've found interesting is the goods claiming phase in the last round.  This is where winner and losers are decided, since the result will determine the final value of each shares you have invested in.  At first I wasn't sure whether it is a better strategy to put all your eggs into one (or two) basket or whether to spread out your portfolio, but upon further reflections, I believe the latter is the smarter way to go.  The reason is because it is very easy to have your cubes get stolen by someone else, therefore, if you have sole ownership of a company, that means you'll be competing against everyone else.  On the other hand, if you have a shared interest with another person, that will factor into the equation because hurting you means he will be affected as well.

Steel Driver is a good game even if it is uninspiring.  I doubt it'll become a favorite, but certainly is one I wouldn't mind playing once in a while.

RATING: 6.8
Good, interesting game. A bit like Transamerica, Union Pacific and Airlines. Auction round allows people to buy shares of a company and own it that round. Building round allows people to lay track and boost a company's worth. Although this part most people get, its the end-game stuff that has a lot of people confused.  Its a game of immediate pay-off vs end-game payoff and blocking can be quite nasty if played right.

Been playing this since it came out. Rating is probably more related to the friend I played with than the game. Recently, we went thru an almanac and reassigned electoral votes. Interesting game as the vote cards are out of allignement and the state margins are way off. Still, always enjoyed the game.

Perhaps the advanced rules make this game a little better, but there not much to get excited about in the basic game.

Players have a handful of cards that will get them votes in various states, which are broken into 4 regions.  On your turn, you pick a region to campaign in and roll a couple dice.  The dice roll determines which states in that region you are actually allowed to campaign in on that turn, so you may play cards which contain the states that the dice roll allowed.

Once someone is out of cards, there is an end game phase where each party gets more vote cards to secretly distribute as they see fit, and then the results of each state are tallied.

There's a little more to it than that, such as some event cards that come into play, and some decisions whether to go hard at focusing some major states or to get a wider breadth of states covered, but the basic game flow is pick a region, roll dice, play cards.  Overall, I could be talked into playing it once in a great while, but it's nothing to get too enthused about.

Production: Ghastly player boards and bland (though functional) cards.  Play: A healthy amount of luck in both the draw and the dice rolls, mixed with some hand management and a few tough decisions about where to invest one's campaign time.  I think that with a better production quality and some stream-lining of the advanced rules I would look forward to playing this again.  (1+0+3) (1 play)

A nice mix of luck and skill, with excitement and tension as the campaign develops.  Fund raising, advertising, whistle-stop campaigning, debates and even the occasional gaffe make this a very interesting and  entertaining game.  For me, the retro appearance of the game is a plus.  Tracking the campaign with tally boards and grease pencils adds atmosphere, and I just love to put the vote cards in the ballot box!  

N.B. - playing time is about 2 hours in my experience, not 60 minutes as indicated in the game information here on BGG.

Excellent historical politically themed game combining strategic and tactical ballot (cards) placement decisions with some interesting random elements - much like in an actual presidential campaign! Creates a nice tension when the final vote is counted, as it is unclear who the winner will be during game play, especially given undecided ballots placed at the end of the game.  I have played only the 1967 3M version, which seems to play a little longer than the advertised 60 minutes due to the the high number of ballot cards that need to be placed.  The 1971 edition has been described as being more streamlined and faster to play.

RATING: 7
Needs some house rules to counteract some of the imbalances, but once done, this is a very compelling game of hand management and resource allocation. Counting up the votes at game end, state by state, is pure excitement. 1960 might be more strategic, but this is more fun.

We play the 4p game with just two, double-handed.

One of my fondest memories of gaming was playing Mr. President with my then ten year old son, Sam, on the evening of the 2000 presidential election, watching the results on television.  And watching, and watching, and watching until well-past midnight and realizing that Al Gore was not going to make a concession speech (neither was George Bush). We finished our game (Sam won) long before the real election was decided.  The game was a great way to blend fact and fiction, and learn a little about the electoral college in the process.

A fond memory from my youth, still have it.  It's easy and fun and quite a good mental challenge, presenting many campaign strategy options.  Of course, it's very dated, using 1970 electoral college and vote cards based on same census.  Would have rated much higher but I've seen really *bizarre* results - I got 90% of the popular vote in one game, and won another by achieving a decent margin in the electoral college despite getting only about 35% of the popular vote!

RATING: 7
Surprisingly good game given its age and among the best titles of the 3M bookcase series, i.e. in a group with the Sackson classics Acquire and Bazaar.
It's entertaining and, more important, still worth playing strategy-wise. In a far-fetched comparison, this could be deemed a very early predecessor to Twilight Struggle. In both games, players face the choice to use cards for the basic action of gaining votes resp. influence or instead perform some advanced actions (debates & advertising resp. coups & realignments). Interestingly, Jason Matthews is damning this game with a '5' rating and the faint praise that it was the best US presidential election game for a long time. Necessarily, Mr.President is less sophisticated with only rudimental hand management, event cards and high stake single die rolls. Especially unlucky debate rolls can throw a two-hour game off the rails for one side. Still, a player suffering this fate can at least look forward to the final tally and the satisfaction of gaining a few unexpected state votes although the match is lost. The experience of counting the votes has a "European Song Contest" vibe when the country votes are called in without the annoyance of the Eastern European block votes.
To me, it's no drawback that the party agendas, candidates and electoral votes are outdated as I have no own experience with the American election system. Mischievous minds anyway might say that even the current American election system and agendas are outdated.

A satisfying two-player or partnership game.  Your initial choice of candidate seems innocent enough until you realize later in the game that some of those characteristics can have severe impact on your ability to be elected, and they are not all equal.

The rules are a bit rough in places and you'll need to homebrew certain elements yourself for the optimal experience (I recommend changing advertising opportunities to rolls of 5 and 9, making press endorsements that roll 2 dice instead be "the highest of two dice," and removing the advertise-once-per-state restriction, as well as scrapping the debates entirely and coming up with your own rules for debates).

All of that having been said, no other game really captures the feeling of a political campaign like this one, and it's immediately engaging and incredibly tense.

Very fond of this oldie, but it's mostly luck (a roll of 9-12 on a major press endorsement pretty much unbalances the game). See the Pres/Vice-Pres partnership game touted here, which I've never tried; sounds intriguing. [many plays dating back to the early 70s]

Properly tense and exciting political game, carefully house-ruled by fellow geeks in order to get the most out of it. Having said this, I've house-ruled the candidate selection myself and am still trying to fine-tune Press Endorsements and Debates for a better balance.

An experience unlike anything else I have played with teams-of-two: the decisions are never totally obvious, and games can be subtly different depending on your opening choice of candidates.

First 2-player game makes me want to play again. Lots of decisions and enough randomness to keep it interesting without dominating the game. Looking forward to both more 2-player and a 4-player game (with the right group). Amazing game for being 40 years old. Second game, 4-player, was even more fun.

Last playing on 11/12/16..R won 293 to D 245... Rumors (scandals) cost D both NY and IL, either would have given D's the win...
Next game a week later ended with the same totals but opposite outcome... how much of this is just luck?

This game feels like gambling. It's very clever how the designers distributed the odds to each of the states: you have a better chance of rolling a die/dice total that matches the more valuable states.

However, way, way too long and repetitive. There are some tactical and strategic decisions to be made, such as aiming for useless regions (i.e. the South) if you have a lot of low-valued ballot cards and finding a balance between competing for key states and ensuring that you've covered as many states as possible -- campaigning in more states than your opponent gives you some more free votes.

I could easily see this going to a 9 (or higher?).  

I adore politics especially election politics and I love area control and I love hand management so this game is made for me. 

I think that this, Road to the White House and 1960: The Making of a President are the three best election games.  RttWH is an entirely different animal though so I will leave it out of the discussion. 

I believe I prefer this to 1960 because while I enjoy the history of that election, I am not keen to play it out over and over.  I realize that the gameplay is the bigger part of the game as the history is largely in the cards, but still, I feel slightly hemmed in by the story.

I also think I like the slightly simpler mechanics of Mr. President.  It is easier to play, but I don't believe one sacrifices much depth.

I will see how all of this plays out after more play. 

I recommend playing with the conversion I did (with much credit going to the previous work of another user).  It gets you right up to date with the 2012 electoral map and state tendencies.  





Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Worth it for the candidate cards alone.  Game play is pretty good, so long as you do not mind keeping vote tallies.  A perfect game for Rockefeller Republicans, who fondly remember the days when the GOP could win in the East and had blue as its color.  (The game has big built-in advantages for the Democrats in the South).

Card game with some unusual mechanisms.  You and your opponent are running for President and Vice President. You do this by casting ballots (cards).  Cards represent votes in 4 states one from each region.  On your turn you decide which region you're campaigning in.  You roll dice to see which states in that region you can play card in.  If you roll doubles or a seven, you have extra options like campaigning in your home state, holding a debate, advertising etc.  When you one of you run out of cards you cast the undecided ballots and then tally it up state by state.  He with the most electorial votes wins.

Just the game for playing during an election year.  You need to have some appreciation of politics to enjoy this one or it will probably end up being a dry game for you. Holds up well for being over 40 years old and worth getting a copy if the topic appeals to you.

Good game, decent game play.  Kind of a period piece now - but interesting to see what the issues the designers thought were important to presidential politics in the '60s compared to now.

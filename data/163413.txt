RATING: 7
1 play  / 4 players

LIKE: The end game scoring cards drive the game, and can be tense and full of decisions, even if it is slightly random. There are ways to help mitigate the randomness. Good interaction with other players, especially when players threaten to place an extra scoring pawn on someone's spot, or change your scoring condition by adding a building.

DISLIKE: Some of the scoring situations are very random, a player may draw a card that aligns perfectly with what they have. I feel the strategies could be somewhat limited if played a lot (a rare situation), because I felt there were definitive arcs in the game.

OVERALL: Good game, with some fun twists to the end game scoring cards. The higher-point scoring cards are more difficult to achieve, so I let all players aware of this while teaching the game. It's not a play-often game, but great for occasional plays.

1st play: Smooth game, plays fast, quick turns, I liked it a bit. The points cards create challenging goals, but some seem quite a bit better than others, so I'm hoping that with a few plays, it becomes easier to plan for an execute the cards. The production quality is great and the board is pleasant. Overall I'm optimistic that this game will be a keeper.

2nd play: I really enjoyed this the second time. The rondel gondola mechanism is neat. I'm not sure the game stands out enough to hold up, as the are a lot of games in this category, but I know when I do play it, it's a well designed enjoyable game.

The system for deciding what action one's takes during one's turn is unique. The vast majority of one's scoring will happen during the post game scoring. Fine game for it's type but this really isn't my type of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Unique action selection mechanism utilizing a rondel with shared movement.  End game scoring is where majority of the points come from and that is determined by cards which help shape strategy.  Hard to tell who is going to win which prevents leader bashing.  Unintentional screwage as people go for goals on the same island.

I have come to the conclusion that the Brands are incapable of designing a bad game: I have yet to play one I have not loved! Sure, the mechanics in their games are (generally) stuff you've seen many times before; but it's the innovative way they make use of the tried-and-true mechanics that make their games so delightful. It's like they say, "We've seen this mechanic in other games, and we like it. Now, let's make it even better!"

The mechanic they re-design in this game is the rondel; and in Murano it essentially IS the game. But they've taken that creaky old wheel and made it into (with the exception of the first several turns) an agonizingly tense game! So nervous was I about my plans being thwarted that I was still trembling (I kid you not!) ten minutes after I had played my first game of Murano! Although a lot of the player interaction is "unintentional" (due to the hidden goals players have), much interaction there is, nevertheless: you need to keep an eye on which islands your opponents are focusing and either a) avoid working there, or b) take steps to ensure that your goals can be achieved there before your opponents make it impossible. The randomness of a player's victory goals ensures a lot of replayability.  There's even an element of "where are the noobs seated?" to throw monkey wrenches into things! A wonderful game which can be played in little more than an hour!

Negatives? The board and bits are rather drab, which doesn't bring to life the non-existent theme. Yes, there's all kinds of thematic, Venetian "stuff" in the game: but none of it ties in very well with the mechanics. Nevertheless, Murano has got to be my favourite game-with-a-pasted-on-theme of all time!

A nice light to medium weight euro. The artist is Klemens Franz and his wellknown style is just great.  The game play doesn't deliver anything new (get money, buy stuff, turn that stuff into vps and abilities, then get more money etc.), but the game flows at a nice pace.

The worker placement/displacement mechanic of this works great and is a neat way of changing things around a little. Took a few turns to understand what we needed to do and why but everything fell into place quickly. Great and interesting game from the same people that made the wonderful game Village. Only real complaint is that the player pieces, with the exception of orange, are all bland and uninteresting and don't fit the game's otherwise bright and colourful theme at all.

Hovering upwards closer to 8 but somewhere between 7 and 8. This is a neat little game.

One critique... in a 2 player game (which is all we've played this at) I've noticed that this tends to overstay its welcome on the table just a little bit.

That critique out of the way... the mechanics of this game are freaking awesome. The character cards, the scoring, the action selection. Really worth looking into. Completely missed this game. Check it out.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This is a neat Rondel game.  Probably a bit too open in a 2p game, but I could see this being more vicious with more players (3p might actually be the best).  One thing that seems really interesting is their are very much so multiple paths to victory.  In my first game I didn't generate any glass at all, and it worked out pretty well, however I could see the glass thing as being a totally viable strategy as well.  While this one did not blow my socks off, this is one I would like to explore further.

Comments that I largely agree with...

BGGer JonBen says:
Lots to like here but the game dragged on for too long. It felt like it should have ended when we were only 60% finished. It may just be that we had the wrong expectations, but it certainly overstayed its welcome. The game also lacks tension because I don't know what goals my opponents have. Although this too might become better with more plays and a better idea of which cards exist in the deck. There are no really agonizing decisions in the game, you may be annoyed if a boat is blocking you, but you can either do something about it for a dollar, or not. One positive thing is that money is very tight, and setting up an engine for income is essential.

BGGer quietcorn says:
I'd say this game is best with either 2 or 4. With 2, you can predict and block effectively, with 4, you get use of the full map with all the islands. With 3, it's cluttered chaos. Overall, I'm not super happy with the game. The luck of the goal cards is troublesome, and the highest value goal cards rely on the luck of the draw of the glass beads, of which there is only one spot to draw from, which makes it tightly contested. Eh. It's so so almost good. 

BGGer llopis says:
It had some hugely annoying elements though like getting points for having islands in specific configurations that were out of my control, or for potentially getting totally locked out of scoring on an island you really needed to.

BGGer ChrB says (in May 2015):
Meh… I liked the gondola mechanic, but I didn’t like the luck of the draw! Some of the cards are ridiculously more powerful than others. And I hated that you don’t have ANY clue whatsoever who is in the lead, and the winner honestly feels a bit random…So this game is a huge let down for me, and I suspect my rating will decrease once I’ve played it one more time (if I am ever going to)…

It sucks so much that you can unintentionally block and be blocked just by random chance – and this is why the winner feels very random… Sure, if you’re not playing smart you probably aren’t going to win, but if every player plays even moderately well, I honestly feel like the winner is determined randomly! Let me support my opinion by saying that in my first play, one player lost 24 points in the last round (!) simply because other players built a building… So he was doing well for a long time, but in the last round everything shattered due to bad luck, and it was impossible for him to react (and no, it wasn’t me)… Also, it’s totally impossible to block the other players as you have absolutely no idea which missions/secret objectives they have; normally I’m a big fan of secret objectives, but when it’s almost the only way you score points, and it can be so swingy, I hate it… We had something like 4-12 points before the endgame scoring, but ended up scoring ~50-70 points! Yes, for real… So you have no way of knowing who is in the lead, and it’s almost impossible to block the other players intentionally…

What I did like was the stressful nature of the game where you can see that you have currently fulfilled your objective, but this can change with a single action (as in I like the stress, not the outcome). It’s also stressful that you have to hurry placing your gondoliers so you can fulfil your secret objectives –if you’re too late, you can get screwed, but at least that’s your own fault.
I wanted to like this game, but unfortunately I don’t.

While he main outer mechanic is great the rest of the game is average to below average, resulting in a game that's fun to try but I wouldn't play it again. Like ticket to ride, you can really luck out with the goals, but you can also really mess someone else up, maybe without meaning to. The goals are the real below average part of the game that muck it up, which is a real shame.

Lovely, light-medium Euro, exactly the kind of game I enjoy playing the most. I like the rondel-style action track, which allows for some good blocking options, and the scoring mechanisms are really interesting. Glass gets you money early on at the expense of points, but shops give you money later on for free (though they take a bit of time to build up). The tension that develops between players' early-game and late-game engines is exciting, and the final scoring cards keep the winner up in the air until the very end. 

My biggest complaint is that some scoring cards can fall in a player's lap towards the end of the game, which means your final score can sometimes boil down to pure luck. I feel like unscored character cards should be worth negative points at the end of the game (instead of the unscored gondoliers actually giving you extra points, as written!).

Neat action selection mechanism with the gondolas moving around the board perimeter.

I also liked how you can acquire "goal" cards throughout the game that will dictate how you score points, and how players can choose to focus on getting more or less goal cards as part of their strategy.

The board play with the building placement seemed a tad boring to me,  but other than that, I thought everything was very enjoyable!

Felt like there were a lot of pathways to victory and every choice mattered. At the same time, a poor choice here and there won't ruin your chances of victory. A great euro-game that makes glass-blowing as fun as it could conceivably be. It does look great once it's out of the box, but that cover isn't doing it any favours.

I want to like this game more but the luck of the cards drags the ratting down. In addition to this money is way to tight and players are forced to sell gondoliers early to generate money. I think if the term "at least" was used more often on the cards the strategy would deepen and make the end game pacing more enjoyable. This game definitely needs an expansion to address some of these issues.

I was really excited to try this as I typically enjoy rondel mechanics in a game, but this rondel just seemed far too open as at least in our 2-player game we always seemed to be able to do what we wanted pretty easily. I also enjoy secret objective games, but not having at least 1 to start made it hard to know what to do first. It can also get chaotic as some goals can change quite quickly since everyone is building on a shared space. 

You almost have to get as many objectives as early as possible to have multiple options, then hope the buildings and customers go your way, then lastly make sure you get your gondoliers placed before the buildings run out. I just never got a feeling like I had as much control as I would have liked in this one.

A tight and highly thematic city building game, with uniquely innovative action selection mechanics, and asynchronous scoring mechanism - which really encourages tactical planning (with a touch of gambling). I do like the use of Gondoliers in activating islands (for the afore mentioned opportunities) in scoring, but really do not care for the awful bog-standard playing pieces used to represent them. Not when interestingly shaped meeples are so readily available! A very enjoyable experience on the whole, but I do think the sale of glass ramps up coin rewards for too quickly (and the payouts should be cut).

Tough game to rank after 1 game. I'm going along, playing it, feeling like it's pretty reasonable, and then it hits me: this game has the most fragile scoring of any game I've ever seen. You get personal scoring goals which make up a significant, if not majority of your score, and many of them will be worth worth either a lot of points, or zero, depending on whether someone else happens to take an action which unbeknownst to them, cancels your scoring card. Seriously? That's just warped. But I dunno. I enjoyed my first game, so I'll try again. But it's hard to imagine this having much staying power.

Long-term replay value may be a question, but the mechanisms are unique enough to keep it around.

2016-04-25 : Light, quick playing building game where what you'll do will be mostly dictated by the end-of-game scoring cards you happen to draw.

Unsure if I'll keep this in my collection after the first play. I like how fast the game plays, very little downtime. Money can be very tight and you have to make some short term sacrifices (e.g. VPs, gondolierrs, etc.) to progress. I was a bit frustrated that I wasn't able to generate much revenue via shops... I didn't pay extra money and drew randomly and my first three were blue... perhaps I should have paid extra and perhaps I  should have taken a build action or two just to get more street tiles out... not sure.

Overall, I like the simplicity and length of the game but there wasn't much there to grab me. I'll give it one more chance before I put I demote it to the closet.

Light euro. Action selection mechanism by a gondola rondel, some randomness due to cards draw, tiles draw, glass beads draw and opponents moves that can spoil your objectives.

Aránylag egyszerű, gateway teteje szabályok. Elemi, gyors lépesek emiatt pörgős játékmenet. Rondellaszerű központi akcióválasztós mechanika. És mindez egy kifejezetten szűkös, egymással elég könnyen kitolós végső csomagolásban. Ha nem szereted nehezen beindulós játékokat, vagy azt, hogy nagyon keresztbe tudnak tenni neked a többiek akár akaratlanul is, akkor ez nem a te játékod. Ha ezekkel ki tudsz békülni, akkor egy jól összerakott, kerek, pörgős, de emellett mély eurót próbálhatsz ki. Nekem nem volt bajom a fentiekkel, azzal viszont inkább, hogy a célkártyák kiegyensúlyozottságáról nem vagyok teljesen meggyőzve. Szerencsére hármasával húzzuk őket, így ennek nincs akkora súlya.

Murano is a light action selection game that (apart from the very drab-looking board) works pretty well for the most part. My one gripe, however, is a pretty strong one: Most of the victory points come from randomly drawn goal cards. Some of those goals are obviously easier to complete than others. That's not really a problem, however. What is is that random actions by other players can unwittingly result in huge swings for some of them. Trying to guess what goals the other players are working towards and sabotaging those efforts is part of the game but it doesn't seem like the risks involved in some of the cards are properly accounted for in the payouts.

Der Zugmechanismus mit dem permanenten Gondelstau ist hübsch. Ich mag auch das daraus entstehende schleppende, mangelnde Spielgefühl und Geldarmut ist auch ein Thema. Allerdings generiert man den Löwenanteil seiner Siegpunkte aus Schlusswertungskarten und hier gibt es doch ein ziemliches Gefälle: manche Karten scheinen leichter zu stemmen als andere. Bei manchen können einem die Mitspieler mit einer Aktion krass die Karte kaputt machen, während man wiederum bei anderen Karten frei von jedwedem destruktiven Einfluss die Kartenbedingung umsetzen kann. Diese Unausgewogenheit innerhalb dieser Kartensektion wirft einen kleinen Schatten auf das Spiel der Handball-Brands, das ich ansonsten sogar besser fände als VILLAGE.

It's a fine looking game and it's okay overall but there are too many useless turns.

Some mildly interesting elements to the game. You draft/purchase cards that give you points if you can fulfill their conditions, along with a large quasi-rondel for action selelction. In theory turns should be fast, although players could certainly AP with the available selections. My problem with this game is that 1.) it's bland 2.) it's very low in terms of player interaction, with the exception of 3.) lots of *accidental* player interaction. Basically, you can get screwed by what other players do, and you're not sure why they would do the move that they just did that kills your card (until the end of the game when cards are revealed). There's very little you can do to sniff out what they're working on. Even if you did, it would be overwhelmed by the chaotic nature of the objectives. There are a few objectives you can potentially lock down, but many of the others feel like a crap shoot. To give some perspective, I scored 40 points off 4 card objectives at the end of the game (for the win), and another 15 or so during the game. If you need the number of buildings of a certain type to match another random attribute controlled by the players, and it gets thrown off on the last turn for no reason you can decipher --well, too bad. 3 of the 4 players in our game spent actions to draft cards, where they didn't think they could fulfill any of the cards from their draw, and so passed on all 3. It just doesn't feel satisfying to have the outcome of objectives determined this way.

Also, if you like theme, this is a pretty soulless game. 

Not a terrible game by any means, but not enough to get an average rating from me. There are a ton of good light medium games out there, and for me this just isn't one of them with the luck of the draws, and the player induced randomness of throwing off many of the objectives, all in a very bland package.

Mayfair messed up with their pricing because many will pass on this because of the high MSRP that can't be bypassed.   This is a well developed, fun game with hidden scoring and a tense but forgiving unique rondel that feels thematic.   As good as Village and a keeper!

There is some novelty in the action selection and scoring systems, but nothing very exciting, and the game still feels like a pretty standard Euro. It generally works well, but there is a problem in the end game, as it's triggered when two stacks of buildings are depleted and there is no incentive to get that last tile. Also, the all-or-nothing scoring of some cards with easily disrupted conditions opens up the potential for players, even inadvertently, wrecking the plans of others, with possible kingmaking.

Murano is a decent game that plays fast, but comes with a good amount of luck and chaos. I played it with 3 and 4 players and liked it much more with only 3. It was frustrating (due to less control) and took longer with 4 players.

The game itself is nice, specially if played fast. The cards however have a huge impact and are drawn from the top of the pile (3 at the same time, though). The right cards at the start and you're pretty much set.

All in all still a nice game, but nothing you need to own.

Really like this one! Nothing really new here, but i like the mix. The end game scoring (Murano-cards) can seem unbalanced, but I would say that they balance out fairly good. Sure, you can get screwed by an another player, but often that has do to which card you chose! Excellent game, really liking it after two plays... 

Update:
One minor nit-pick I have with the game, is that it sometimes can take too much time to decide  which card to chose... It kind of breaks the rhytm of the game, which otherwise is quite quick...

Muranot könnyed stratégiai vagy nehezebb családi játéknak lehet minősíteni. A  táblán körbe vannak az akciók jelezve. Ezekre a mindenki által mozgatható gondolákkal lehet rálépni és végrehajtani. Ha már egy gondola van rajta, azt előtte el kell mozgatnunk. Egy gondolát ingyen a többit pénzért kell mozgatnunk. Az akciókkal négy féle épületből vásárolhatunk, amit majd az utcákkal együtt kell leépítenünk. Pénzre tehát szükségünk van, amit külön pénz felvevő helyen kapunk vagy az árusító bodéink után, ha sikerül megfelelő színű vásárlókat az utcára letennünk, illetve az üveggyárak után kapott színes üvegek után. 

Pontokat a leépített épületek és a végén a célkártyáink után kapunk. A célkártyákat is pénzért kaphatunk és csak akkor teljesülnek, ha az egyik emberünket - szintén pénzért - elküldjük ahhoz a szigethez,ahová a célkártyáink szólnak. 

Az elején az akciókártyák jó szolgálatot tesznek. A végén az célkártyák nagyon fontosak, illetve nem árt ha már pár célunkat már az építkezés közben ismerjük, mert különben elég szerencse vezérelt lesz a végső értékelés.

This is weird, in kind of a good way? The board is almost a big rondel crossed with a worker-placement field, where you can move any piece as far as you want as long as you don't pass someone else. I thought that was really cool, although the rest of the game (something about building stuff on islands and secret goals) didn't hang together as well as I wanted it to. (1 play)

Yet another standard euro.  ZERO innovation and minimal excitement.
But it works smoothly and it's not overly long.
The time is (very) tight here and you cannot plot too far-reaching plans.

The only mechanical problem is some chaos when it comes to completing secret golas.  By pure accident you can gain/lose VPs, because an opponent just placed something on the map which completes/ruins your goal.  And that’s not rare...

Overall – not a terrible experience, hence '6' rating.

RATING: 3
The action selection mechanic in this game just doesn't work with a certian type of player: the one that will take a slightly sub-optimal move in order to make sure that the next player will not have a good move available to them. In every euro that I can think of, that's just good play. In this game it causes the gondolas to stack up in 1 or 2 groups causing any players with no gold to have to pass. And of course when passing that same player will pass in such a way that causes the grouping to get even worse, making it entirely likely that they'll have to pass again next turn).

This might cause you to say that you just shouldn't get caught without any gold, unfortunately that's easier said than done when playing with 4 of these types of gamer! There are 4 gold spots on the board, two of them require buildings before you can use them, the other two are good options but it's very easy to get locked out of them.

Despite all this, I enjoyed my first 2 plays (when this problem didn't surface), and wonder if my 4th play will be better now that I know to rush for the 2 early gold spots, assuming that my group ever agrees to play this again.

Euro game with a nice twist on the rondel mechanic: several gondolas on a rondel that can move up until the next gondola. I like to call it: gondola rondela. After one play I rate the game with a preliminary 7. I feel that some scorecards leave an easy opportunity for players to mess up the score condition, so that a player can end up with a scorecard of zero value. Also a bit too much randomness when drawing cards and glass tokens keeps this from getting a higher mark.

Murano is a strategic boardgame that haphazardly progresses toward end goals that players learn as they go along. Early in the game, you are likely to find yourself building buildings or committing to score areas, uncertain if they will help you or your opponents more in the end. Late in the game, with some goal cards in hand, you can start to shape or abandon your early choices depending on what you get. Throughout the game you are either building to support your goals or picking goals to support your earlier builds. It's not a criticism. It's a feature.

The action selection mechanic is unique. Actions are spaced in a circle around the board. Every other action space or so, at the game's beginning, is seeded with a boat. You can move any boat forward one space for free and take the next action. You can also move forward more spaces, and/or push other boats forward out of your way for 1 coin each. Certain action spaces are more valuable early, some late, and so boats tend to get gummed up right before the unpopular spaces, which means taking the action you want will start to cost you. You can also pass, move a boat and take 1 coin. The mechanic is crafty and can also feel frustrating and constipated. By passing, it also allows you to mess with other players if you think you know what action they want to take.

The board is divided into a number of islands with building spaces. Players build streets with customers as well as shops, glass factories, palaces, and special buildings, which can enhance some of your actions. Goal cards provide a variety of ways to score an island at game's end depending on what is built on it, but you can only score a goal card if you have placed a gondolier at the island - so there are a number of steps needed to get points at the end and they don't always come to you in the preferred order. Those who love this game, and some do, like the initial uncertainty and having to maneuver and adjust as you build and get more information about what you need. If that kind of uncertainty drives you nuts, stay away. I enjoy this with the right audience, but my tastes tend to run more strategic for a game of this length.

這個遊戲有著又大又亮眼的圖版，版塊放置建設城市，選取角色為自己加分，感覺上像是各做各的事，實際上這遊戲有趣的地方在作者所設計的類輪盤機制，並且把用來驅動輪盤行動的金錢卡的很死，讓玩家必須扣分生產玻璃來賣錢。
這遊戲在結束時爆分的感覺其實還蠻有意思的，特別是在建設行動中感覺像是為對方鋪路，但其實是為了自己的隱藏目標在做準備，不論有沒有被其他人看穿，而攪局破壞了計劃，內心其實是波濤洶湧，但又不能形於色，這是很有趣的點。

RATING: 7
I've had fun with both plays, but also seen how the game doesn't have the strategic focus of the best of them.  There is a novel action selection mechanism which somewhat arbitrarily makes some choices more expensive, but which lacks the planning element of Mac Gerdt's terrific rondel mechanism.  You use actions to take buildings, earn money, lay buildings, and then most critically accumulate character cards and place gondoliers on islands.  These cards each specify the points you'll win if the combination of buildings on the selected island meets certain criteria, so you have to then manage what gets built in order to assure the best score.

Played Oct 2014

Lots to like here but the game dragged on for too long. It felt like it should have ended when we were only 60% finished. It may just be that we had the wrong expectations, but it certainly overstayed its welcome. The game also lacks tension because I don't know what goals my opponents have. Although this too might become better with more plays and a better idea of which cards exist in the deck. There are no really agonizing decisions in the game, you may be annoyed if a boat is blocking you, but you can either do something about it for a dollar, or not. One positive thing is that money is very tight, and setting up an engine for income is essential.


--------------------------------------------------------

Read rules Oct 2014

A big-box gamer's game from Inka & Markus Brand cannot be ignored. In 2008 it was A Castle for All Seasons, in 2011 it was Village, and right on time in 2014 we have Murano. So far they've improved each time... just saying.

Murano looks great. The most exciting aspect is the action selection which takes place on a shared action wheel (to curtail those who will claim otherwise, I want to go on the record now that this is not a rondel!). Actions are arranged in a loop around the outer edge of the board and gondolas are sprinkled on some of the action spaces. On your turn you can perform an action or pass. If you perform an action you choose an action space and then move a gondola onto it. Gondolas (I really want the plural form to be gondola, but I guess it's not) must move in a counter-clockwise direction and cannot move onto or past other gondolas. If the action space you want is blocked you must move gondolas to free the space. You must pay to move gondolas, to move 1, 2, 3, 4... gondolas you must pay 0, 1, 3, 6... coins. I love interesting action-selection mechanics which is one of the things that keeps me squarely in the Feld fan club.

The game has several sources of VP, it certainly seems like a game that rewards some specialization and also a keen eye for opportunity and contrarian play. The one reservation I have is that the main source of VPs is hidden goal cards. You pick them up during the game and reveal and score them at the end. I tend not to like this type of scoring in games. For example, I often play Troyes and Suburbia with house rules to eliminate the hidden goals. This may require a similar fix, playing with these cards public would do it, or maybe it will be fine the way it is. Either way it looks like a rock-solid medium weight Euro and it's high on my list of games to play.

RATING: 5
Objectively, this game is probably better than my personal impression. It just happened to push all the wrong buttons. Engine development giving random skills, random draws to create sets, secret goals to be selected from a random set of cards, initial shots in the dark that might work out or not, other players trying to hinder efforts of other players to fulfill their secret goal cards and by chance succeeding or not? Not again, not for me.

Sasquatch 2014 "Neutral". I need to play this again before bringing final judgement, but my first play went from "enjoying it" to "please let it end". It seems to suffer from the Hacienda-like end-game situation that can happen where nobody wants to waste their turn pushing the game to the end-game condition. This could be mediated by having other end-game conditions.

Rather smart and compact action selection mechanism is the heart and soul of this game. Almost everything besides maybe the bonus cards works around it and it's surprisingly not at all prone to AP. The rest of the game supports the action selection smoothly and you'll get a very nice game of constant tactical choices. I'm not so sure about long term replayability, though, as many of the choices players make seem to lead towards the same path.

Cool rondel mechanism, put too many boats for it to flow. Cash shortage means traffic jams means no decisions to be made. Paying points for a money gamble is a stupid action that is only done out of frustration. While the gondolier scoring is a nice mechanism, the scoring cards are mostly such random, unplannable situations that it mostly comes down to luck of the draw: "I need a place with exactly as many red customers as special buildings? Well lucky me, there is one right there!"

RATING: 7.5
Fast playing rondel and tile-laying game from the designers of Village. The shared rondel is unique and you have to plan around other players potentially taking actions you really want because the cost of taking actions repeatedly goes higher and higher as you move more boats around the rondel. The decisions don't cause too much AP though so the game moves along at a nice pace.

Nagyon tetszik az akcióválasztó mechanizmusa, szívesen látnám más játékokban is. Az építős része jópofa, tetszik az egyszerűsége. A kártyák viszont nem tetszenek benne. A játék közben előnyt biztosító lapok érzetre nem hasonlóan hasznosak, a célkártyák meg néha elég fura feltételeket fogalmaznak meg, jó részük nehezen tervezhető.

Mindenesetre hangulatos, gyors, viszonylag könnyű játék, úgyhogy szívesen játszanék még vele, a pozitívumok hangsúlyosabbak, mint a lapokkal szembeni ellenszenvem. :)

Not a badly designed game, but it leaves a bit to be desired in some areas. Money is too tight, and it can be hard to get more if you haven't properly constructed a machine to do so using glass factories or shops, the latter of which can be a crapshoot. Tight money means a restrictive board, leaving few good moves to make without the capital to move multiple gondolas. The goal cards aren't that exciting, and you can end up drawing without getting anything decent for your strategy several times in a row. This review seems all negative, but those are the main complaints, and pretty much everything else in the game is good.

From the moment I playtested this one at GenCon two years ago I knew it was something special. This is a fantastic Euro game with a very interesting "rondel" turn action mechanic that allows for a lot of strategy as well as player interaction. Competing for limited board space and trying to desperately fulfill your point card achievements really makes this game a blast to play!

The action selection mechanism is intriguing at first, but when I played it there seemed little room for tactical manoeuvring; it turned out to be an almost arbitrary way to determine which actions you can play at what cost. Other than that it's an okayish game of building up islands according to the mission cards you buy. The special powers you can buy from another card deck are cool, but the game is too short and the card draw too random to make cool combo's I think; it's gonna be pretty random what special power you get.

The Brands are a creative designer duo. Their children's games get best children's game DSP, and not only once, or Kinderspiel des Jahres, so when they design complex Euros they still focus on fun and add lots of interesting small ideas to the game (which, in better years, might result in a Kennerspiel des Jahres for them).
As for Murano, it also offers a few nice ideas. And the action selection mechanism is closer to the perfect mixture of worker placement and rondel games than anything before. It even has a map which is always a plus for me (have I already said that?). Unfortunately this new mix of worker placement and rondel games still does not feel very novel in gameplay - I just didn't feel it would twist my brain to any other directions than many other games before. Still, a good game, but not very memorable.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed my first play - this is perhaps my favorite game involving a rondel mechanism (I'm not usually a big fan of rondels). Several different routes to victory appear viable. On your turn you move one of the gondolas a space (or more if you are willing to pay) and take the action (or pass after moving a ship and take a $1). I'd recommend avoiding a similar strategy of the person before you! Character cards provide over half the scoring most likely as long as you place gondoliers where they need to be and meet the card requirements. Special buildings can also be acquired which grant you a special ability or modifies an existing action to be better for you. Money can be tight at times.

Another fantastic game by Markus and Inka Brand! I am a huge fan of Village so I was excited to try this game out. I love how tight the action spaces are and how you really have to be opportunistic with your turns. This game can be very mean or very nice. What I mean by that is sometimes all the players really want a certain action space and if you are nice you can just agree to take turns and not block each other from getting the action. I love getting secret objectives and trying to fulfill them without explicitly letting my opponents know what I am up to. Definitely a thinky game but one of my favorites!

It comes from two designers (Inka and Magnus Brand), which are hit (Village, La Boca) or miss (Guatemala Cafe, A Castle for all Seasons) for me.

Murano was an interesting game for sure. Once that it took me about half a game to figure out how to play (and to realize I should draw objective cards early). The neatest part was the gondola rondel to take actions.

It had some hugely annoying elements though like getting points for having islands in specific configurations that were out of my control, or for potentially getting totally locked out of scoring on an island you really needed to.

I got this because its by the same designers of Village. I like everything about the game. The artwork, the action selection rondel and the way you start out the game not knowing how you are going to score and potentially win the game.

You only score in the game by two methods. Firstly you will get a few points in game by developing buildings, unfortunately most of these will be spend as a penalty for all the pollution you cause by producing glass. Bummer! Secondly you get the majority of your score from end game scoring, by buying scoring character cards during the game (they get progressively more expensive) and then developing islands / your glass production to match the character cards requirements. Then if, by the end of the game, you have delivered one of your gondoliers to the island the character required, and you have met their scoring needs, you will get end game points. Obviously all players have different scoring opportunities but they may be on the same island(s) and it is from this the interaction partly springs.

From my few plays my only doubt is that possibly the scoring cards for collecting a specific colour of glass bead are overpowered. But take this with a pinch of salt as I have only played the game a few times and it is not as if you can start out playing the game and only plan to win by scoring glass beads. Firstly you have to buy the right scoring card and then I feel they are possibly only over powered if you get the additional special ability card that allows you to swop out the colours of the glass beads you draw when you produce glass.

Like Village this is an excellent euro with slightly more player interaction via the action selection rondel, control of buildings on islands (and scoring potential) and positioning of gondoliers on the spots on the island jetties. At the moment I like it more than Village and would love to play it more.

Rating based on 4 players.

Not my usual type of game in general, but this played smoothly, and, once you get going, quickly. The way the gondolas get into traffic jams is both interesting and infuriating, and the ability to block others with gondoliers adds a little bit more interaction between players, which is otherwise fairly low.

Better than Village IMO (although it's close).  This is a great medium weight game that I can pull out with casual gamers.  Have played it with 2p and 3p, and it scales pretty well IMO.  There is definitely some randomness that could bother certain gamers, but the game doesn't pretend to be anything deeper than it is so I'm okay with it.  Fun game with some interesting decisions...

beautiful game. like the big rondell around. Change the game with a slight variant. each player draws 5 goal cards and chooses 1 to keep at the beginning of the game. this way, everybody has at least one Goal from the start. More new-player-friendly this way. 

I heard from some that the game has too much luck involved when you draw goal cards towards the end of the game. thats probably true if you go buy them then. but that's just bad strategy and the player's fault! you should know what you are working for so buy cards not just a the end but during the game.

It's a very interesting Rondel game... not the basic normal rondel, the Rondel in this game is around the board where the actions are printed and there are several Gondolas that you can move to select the action you want to perform.

The game is very easy to understand and you'll quickly grasp what you need to do... the interaction between players is very interesting because your decision to move a specific Gondola can open or close some spaces that the next player wanted to use...

Clever action mechanism where actions become available and unavailable as gondols are moved around the board. In addition a victory point system with both immediate points based on buildings and end-game points based on random and hidden objectives. Unfortunately, this also leads to little interaction where as you can't tell how your actions affect other players. Still, a fast played game with little downtime.

Purchased from BGG Market 20 Jan 17. 

This is a surprise hit for me. It's has an action selection track, hidden end game goals, area control by taking advantage of yours and other players placement. The rounds can go quickly, in a minute or less, once players play a few rounds and learn the game flow.

This is a tough one to rate. All the scoring essentially is at the end of the game. It really does take a play to understand what it happening. However, the more I've thought about it the more I've just felt this is another Euro that I enjoyed, but I'm done with most likely.

I enjoyed the fake-rondel action, but otherwise... aggressively 'meh'.

Perhaps it's me.  Perhaps I'm done with Euro games as a whole.  Perhaps there's just such a glut of game designers that the market is getting flooded with very similar designs.  But the modern Euro of worker placement for money to be exchanged for goods to be placed on spaces to be end-gamed for VPs in any number of possible combos is getting really, really old.  And Murano did nothing to change that feeling.

RATING: 7
Wonderful game. So clever that you have to activate your end-game scoring cards (character cards) by placing your pieces (gondoliers) on the islands where you intend to score them. You want to be careful not to miss out on a scoring card by failing to place a gondolier on the appropriate island. This creates some pressure to get them out before the end-game condition is in danger of being triggered. However, other players actions can (and often will) change the conditions on the islands that affect the value of your character cards. So, there's tension right up until the end. It's almost impossible to guess your position in the game until those character cards are revealed. Beautiful theme, mechanics, and presentation. Highly recommended. Oh, and it works great with 2 players.

Gioco piacevole che necessita di programmazione ma dove la forte interazione dovuta alla scelta delle mosse rende il tutto molto complesso. Il gioco è piacevole, si deve cercare di raggiungere i propri obiettivi costruendo sulle varie isolette della cittadina veneziana negozi, fabbriche e case. Durante il gioco però avremo una prima fase dove si dovrà far di tutto per accaparrarsi monete o preparare un impianto remunerativo (negozi o fabbriche) di sostentamento economico. Senza monete non ci sarà possibilità di fare le azioni necessarie. Alla fine si lascia giocare con piacere, provocando qualche nervosismo a chi si vede affossare i propri progetti. Semplice e veloce è un discreto gioco da 60, 90'.

Murano is an OK game, but not fantastic.

Positives:
The rondel is implemented in a very interesting way. Murano has an excellent sense of competition as players battle for space on the islands. There is also a feeling of tension as the end approaches and players hustle to complete their goals. 

Negative:
The goal cards are the game's biggest (huge) disadvantage - they are [i]incredibly[/i] swingy, and the most powerful tend to rely on luck. After 60+ minutes of Euro-style husbandry it is disconcerting to see huge scores from gambling on long-shot goals. It is equally unsatisfying when one of these goals is stymied at the last minute. 
If players memorised all the cards then the difficulty might be alleviated, but I don't think my group will bother.

Another great entryway game. Murano is fun and engaging, light to medium weight in terms of time and rules explanation. This tile-laying game is intuitive, it flows nicely and player's turns are fast and AP is cut short by the rondel mechanic. I love expansions and think they usually improve a game but, more than that, I like a game that's perfect in design and play from the very start. Murano is one of those games. It's a terrific game to play at any time.

This game features an excellent action selection mechanic that is a neat twist on the rondel.  I also enjoy putting buildings on a map where positioning matters.  he ony drawback is that too much scoring (nearly all) is based on hidden randomly drawn goal cards so it is nearly impossible to judge if what you are doing is a huge boon to another player.  Still, a game I would gladly play again.

Murano features a large action selection wheel that goes along the edge of the board, with a number of boat tokens that players could move on their turn to perform one of the actions.  Players can pay extra money to move boats extra spaces if the action they want to take is too far away, or if another boat is blocking the action.  The actions let players buy and place tiles onto islands in the center of the board, which helped them make money or gain points.  There were also cards that could be purchased to gain end-of-game bonuses.  Boats tended to clump around the wheel, limited actions that could be taken.  Money in the game was very tight, and there were two main ways to get it--setting up markets that required a lot of tile placements but eventually could start paying out nice income amounts, and setting up glass factories that had the potention for very large payouts, but also had very significant victory point penalties.  There was only one spot on the board for each of these actions, making the competition for these spots particularly fierce.  Personally, I didn't feel like the game was very well put together, as strategies were not intuitive, and the number of non-productive turns I had was frustrating.

Has some nice ideas like the Action selection by Moving the ships. The Huge Number of Character Cards which decide if you make enough Points or not, seem a Little bit to constructed. 
We also didn't like the factor that you are playing almost blind regarding the other Players, since you don't know for what Goals they are playing and there are so many Cards, that you don't get any Chance of finding out.
Noz our Kind of game. I also think the replayability isn't quite high.

RATING: 6
This game is one of those giant roundel games around the outside of the board. On a player's turn they advance a boat to a spot and resolve an action there. The trick is, you can't move a boat past another boat, although you can pay your precious money to move other boats out of the way.  Because this is expensive, you do often wind up with traffic jams that could force you to resolve a less than ideal action.

What I find compelling about this game is the tension created from trying to get the actions you want, keeping afloat in money, and knowing when to stop getting new objective cards and focus on completing those objectives.

One problem I have with the game is that there are essentially two ways to produce money in the game, which again, you really need not only to mitigate the traffic jams but also to take nearly every action in the game. One way is through tile draws with both the buy a shop action, which gets you a random colored shop, and then the build action with which you can draw two random road tiles and hope the people on those roads match up with your shop.  Then later, you can use the single action space where you choose an island to have one of each color of your shops produce a dollar per matching person on the roads. This action always gets clogged up. The other way is through buying and building glass producing buildings. When you take the action in the one spot that produces glass, you loose 2 vp per glass you produce, and you get that many random pulls from a bag and hope the gems you drew are either all the same, in which case they can be sold for lots of money, or that they match up endgame scoring cards you took. Either way, you need to involve yourself in some randomness, and with the glass way, your potential is higher, but knowing when to stop taking those big VP hits is tough.

The second issue I have with the game is that many of the endgame victory point cards require islands to be setup in a particular way that relies on your opponents. For example, in one game I had a card that needed an island to have equal red buildings to black customers. I set that up, then paid to get my scoring pawn attached to that island, and from that point on I was at the mercy of other players choosing not to mess that ratio up, without them having any idea they were doing so. This sort of blind blocking troubles me. When someone messes up my plans, I like the to know they are doing it. I like it to be part of their strategy, or a choice they are making. I feel cheated when they proclaim, 'Oh I had no idea I was messing up your secret card, I just chose that spot randomly.'

Aside from those problems, I do like the flow of the game, I like the look of the game, and there is a lot of enjoyable tension. I think if either the money engine was a little more enjoyable or reliable, or if the endgame victory cards were generally more self determinable, this would be a keeper for me.

Really enjoyed this one. Beautiful art from one of my favorite bg artists. Played this with two and I like the fact that it has double sided board specifically for two player option. Buying the customer cards is great because of the bonus end game scoring and it gives things for you to work towards during the game. I like the idea of getting your gondoliers onto different islands before the end of the game in order to trigger your bonus. 

I look forward to playing this one again and seeing how it holds up to multiple plays over time. Had a lot of fun.

I love rondels, and this game board is just one giant rondel. it can be quite tricky moving boats in a way that gives you what you want but doesn't set up another player for a big move. Scoring is tricky in Murano because nothing is worth points until you start collecting cards, which will then tell you your scoring objectives. This means that a good portion of the game is blind build up, and the rest is cashing in on your hard work. It sounds random and annoying, but I actually found the process very intuitive. Players should have no problem predicting potential scoring paths with a good teacher or after one practice game.

I really like this game a lot.  I like the idea of the islands, boats, and building different types of buildings that do different things.  The Special buildings that give you a special ability are really fun!

But I really like the scoring cards and the strategy that goes along with them.  Other players can destroy your goal points by unknowingly building on the island you are working on, and that at first aggravated me about the game.  But there is a strategy to help avoid that.  Money is not too tight as others have commented.  You just need to create an income strategy first thing.  There is a lot to think about in this game, and that's why I like it so much.  It takes several plays before it really begins to shine.  

 Super fun game and I like the components and the look of the game.   Highly recommended!

穆拉諾簡介
穆拉諾是義大利威尼斯湖中的一個島。名義上是島，其實是群島，島與島之間由橋樑連接，形同一島。穆拉諾在威尼斯以北約1.6公里。穆拉諾以製造色彩斑斕的穆拉諾玻璃器皿而聞名於世，特別是拉絲熱塑。

公元6世紀前，穆拉諾被羅馬人佔據。從6個世紀開始，威尼斯奧德爾佐人到此居住。穆拉諾海島作為一個捕魚港和食鹽產地逐漸繁榮起來，形成一個商港。從11世 紀開始由於居民遷出，穆拉諾曾走過一段下坡路。13世紀穆拉諾由威尼斯波德斯塔（Podestà）管治，與礁湖內其他的島嶼不同，穆拉諾鑄造自己的硬幣。

玩家在 Murano 這個瀉湖式的小島發展玻璃業，蓋多樣的建築並雇用角色在遊戲結束獲取分數。遊戲的環繞行動機制我覺得還是有點小特色的，遊戲總體口味偏輕，不過正好符合我這類中輕度玩家的胃口，整個遊戲過程中一直享受著思考的樂趣，又不會感覺太累，強烈推薦！

Pretty clever and interesting game. You have basically a shared rondel of actions, and so other people can block you or at least make your choices far more expensive. You have some end game scoring cards that you need to amass, and there's this fascinating balance between building up the islands and then laying claim to it by parking a gondolier there so you can score it. Money can be hard to come by, and the means for doing it either cost you gems (which likely could be turned into points), or on a select couple of spaces on the boards that your opponents will block. Overall, you've got tough decisions to make all the way around, and I love seeing how the islands build up and how to score them.

This is a worker placement game where each player is trying to get the most points by developing areas of a cluster of islands and claiming character cards that score end game points for different criteria.

In my first play of this game each player pursued a different strategy and the final point spread was 42, 48, 48, and 50.  This is something great about the game, there are several different paths to victory giving the game a lot of replayability and variability.  Probably the best first move of the game is to draw a character card since these score you end game points and can help you plan a strategy.

The way action selection is done in this game is really interesting.  All around the outside of the board are action spaces.  dispersed among these spaces are several boats.  On a player's turn they can move any boat any number of spaces as long as they don't pass through another boat and stop on an empty space, they then take the action of the space they stopped on.  You can move other boats out of the way but it costs money and more money the more boats you need to move so getting to a space at the back of a cluster of boats could be incredibly expensive to get to.

And that's the other really big thing to consider, money is really tight in this game.  There is only one "2 gold" space, one income space, and passing only gets you one gold.  There are more glasswork spaces and they give you potentially large amounts of gold but at the cost of points.  If you are someone who doesn't like the tension of resource constraints this wouldn't be the game for you.

There isn't really any theme to speak to past being merchants in this chain of islands but the game is very mechanically rich and interesting and unique mechanics make, for me, just as fun games as thematically rich ones.

A very good, tense, engaging, and unique worker placement game.

Gentle, common rondel action selection system. Quick, not overly intricate(which is a good thing). Not quite enough bumping together for my taste, and the point scoring is hidden so solitaire feel. Like the game end mechanic and the tight cash. Not unpleasant but not earth shattering either. Happy to play again no desire to own.

Taking place in the beautiful city of Venice, you are a glassblower by trade and are trying to make it big in the local industry. Attract customers to your shops, construct glassblowing factories, ride gondolas around the islands, build beautiful palaces, pave cobblestone streets; you do it all in this game! Choose one or a combination of several strategies to gain the most power, prestige, and wealth as a Venetian glassblower. 
 
Murano has three components which I love: 1. the clever mechanics of selecting an action each turn, 2. the "mission" cards, and 3. messing each other up! 1 - The islands are surrounded by water spaces with several gondolas. To select a desired action, you move a gondola to an open space between that gondola and the one in front of it. You can image this can create a backlog of gondolas for particularly desirable spaces. To account for this, you may pay one coin to move an "extra" gondola around the river. This is a very fun component of the game. 2 & 3 - No one knows who has which missions to accomplish, so there is not really any malicious thwarting, but don't mind the curse and fist-slam after you take a seemingly innocuous action that completely messed up your opponent! 
 
This game has particular appeal to me because I lived in Italy for two years and speak the language fluently. As we played Murano, I could clearly picture local and tourist shoppers strolling down the narrow cobblestone streets perusing products left and right. I could hear the yelling of the salesmen and women in dialect Italian as they tried to capture your attention and pique your interest in their products. The smells, sights, and sounds were so familiar to me. Murano gets an extra point for so thoroughly pulling me into the vibrant Italian village scene. 
 
We've played this over a dozen times recently, and I could keep playing it. Replay value is very high because of the different yet interrelated paths to victory. Overall, I give Murano a very high 8.5 for its clever gameplay, its balance between planning and needing to roll with the punches, and its beautiful artwork and scenery. 
 
Bonus tip: I find that pushing shops heavily in the very beginning sets you up with a solid income to where you may be the only player not scrambling for a revenue stream in the middle of the game. This will make more sense to you as you play.

Good design, strong Euro. Laughs at the idea of theme, but gets away with it. Unique rondel and have to go through several steps of mechanics to do anything meaningful, which is satisfying when completed. I do not like the pollution point-penalties, though, for making glass. Odd thematic choice given subject of the game.

I've raised this from an 8. It has really grown on me over my first half a dozen or so plays. Love the gondola mechanic. Many paths to victory through the character cards. Tight close scoring games, beautiful art work. Very satisfying to play. One of my top 3 from Essen.

2-3 Player board has a defect where they misaligned the actual board printout on the wrap around edge from the other side.

Game plays well and easy to grasp with multiple ways to gain points. Plays well with 2 player, should be better with 3/4. No luck elements other than drawing tiles and cards. You get to draw 2 cards and keep one so luck is diminished.

tl;dr: fine strategy game

A new game from the designers of [thing=104006][/thing] by Lookout games? This can't go wrong, can it? Well, maybe it can, but it doesn't. This is a fine strategy game. And it has a nice action selection mechanism that is quite novel. But it's also a source of some frustration. If you're trying to do a certain action and it just keeps on getting more expensive while you try to save up and avoid helping other players perform said action, that can be frustrating. But maybe that will be fixed with repeated plays, when I better get the hang of the game flow and how to plan ahead.
But for now I say: fine game, but I can't say I love it from this first time

Gorgeous looking game.  Two player was still fairly tight with the smaller map.  Gondolas tended to get clumped on desirable spots as no one wanted to waste money to clear the way.  Money is very tight!  Enjoyable and thematic.  Eager to play again.  Wife approved!

Murano works pretty well, but feels a bit too abstract and dry for my tastes. Also disappointing is the great disparity in the utility of the cards derived from the special red buildings, which range from fantastic (like the one that allows you to treat gems of one color as another, which is useful in the early game to get much-needed money and in the late game for trading gems in for points) to just horrible (a great many give you one point when you do some specific action and will generally let you grind out four or five points over the course of the entire game ... if you warp your whole strategy to squeeze some benefit from them). Draw the good cards and win!

The Brand's have brought us another fairly interesting eruo game, and I enjoy this one. Honestly I feel quite a bit of Feld influence in this as the "cool" thing about this game is the action selection mechanic. Feels like the rest of the game is, while still a solid game and interesting, the action selection is where the key is. 

[ImageId=554375]
The game really requires more than 2 players in order to give it that tight, congested feel that the game really needs to shine. The board scales from 4 to 3 players, but the 3 player board is the same for the 2 player board and it's just very wide open.

Even the resident flatterers got this one right. A better 2-3 player 'Family Euro'. Great art and design work - easy to learn too (game iconography is spot on). Every game is different, even with the same players: re-playability is high. *Minimize 'AP' w/ 4 players, by limiting card choices to: 'pick 2, keep 1', for Character cards; 'Take the top card', for Special building cards (and don't tell 'em) - shaves off a minute or two, per turn anyway. Still, I think it's too tight with more than three. *Would love to see the game it's being compared to for appearances.. I think it's gorgeous.

:laugh:

Everyone who sees it wants to play it. Awesome game and quick... Currently flying under the radar. Get it while you can. *Could use another microbadge. *hint-hint* Needs a card expansion (well I just want one). *hint-hint*

15/02/2015 I'm calling it now on first play. This is a Kennerspiel nominee. Good component quality, simple rules, interactive, and by a couple of designers (Inka and Markus Brand) with a long history of Kennerspiel success. Its better than their other award-winning design, Village, due to the variable scoring cards, which increase replayability out of the box.

Murano is a rondel game with secret objectives for island building. Can get very vicious as you move the gondolas into inconvenient positions to stop your opponent taking the action they want, and build random streets/buildings to stop them completing the labyrinthal secret-end-game-scoring/objective cards, e.g. if there are exactly the same number of red buildings as grey customers on the island, score 12 points.

It's well put-together and fun, very engaging throughout, and sufficiently innovative that we don't own any similar games.

A fun little mid-weight that focuses on moving gondolas around a board and having things in places for end-game conditions mostly. Also, money management--money is tight in this game. Had a great time playing this one.

RATING: 8
This flew under my radar, as it looked too simple to be engaging, at least at a quick glance. Fortunately, interest in my game group was pretty high, so I managed to snag a copy in a trade. I'm glad I did.

While it certainly ended up being on the simple side mechanically, the gondolas that crawl around the board's modified rondel system are a stroke of genius. They can be moved both offensively and defensively and the very nature of the system makes the most desired actions at the table the most expensive as well.

That's not enough to carry the game of course, but the manner in which victory conditions for each player are slowly revealed, secretly, over the course of the game is equally engaging. Early on, players tend to build in such a way as to maximize profits and worry about little else. As the game develops, that begins to change as players start to build toward maximizing their victory points goals. These goals have little to do with increasing productivity, but rather are based upon matching somewhat arbitrary patterns, that may or may not have sprung up on the islands in the early phases. Trying to control the development of each island to match those goals really drives the endgame and makes it surprisingly deep.

It also plays in under an hour, which makes it a great night cap. I'm glad my group talked me into it.

A solid effort, but nothing spectacular.

The most novel aspect is that it is really a worker placement game using a common set of workers that everyone can move around and use.

The game itself really focuses on a slew of end game scoring cards.  So, you have no idea who is winning until you see who completed their end game cards.  The difficulty is some cards are very specific and you can get hosed very easily on completion.

RATING: 6.5
Nothing really new. The game flows well and there is, as a novelty, the fact that among the many possible actions only those currently without a gondola are free, all the others cost as much as many gondolas you have to move. Unfortunately i didnt understand the rules correctly the first time and really missed an important part of the game.
Anyway it seems interesting somehow and i could raise my rating if i played it again

RATING: 8.5
What I think is special about Murano is that you start the game without any end game goals. You have to collect your goal cards through a specific action on the board. This means your strategy will be different each game but at least you will have some sort of choice about the path you want to take. Murano is one of those games that I think most people will enjoy.

Euro city builder based on the glassmaking industry on a small group of islands just off the coast of Venice. A fleet of gondolas serve as an action selection rondel on the perimeter of the island area map. Place building tiles along street routes for your glassmaking factories, palaces, or tourist shops. Personal objectives for set collection. Place your hired gondaliers for area control to complete your objectives. The rondel system has a gin rummy quality where you want to avoid helping your opponents by freeing up action spaces they need. This gets frustrating with more players. Tight board makes an anxious race grabbing the real estate you need for your objectives. Lots of strategy decisions between screwing an opponent or building your engine. Clever mechanic to pay extra cost to move the gondolas out of the way. Also an interesting mechanic losing victory points when making glass.  I also like the generic special building tiles where you select a card for its special ability. Luck of the draw is nicely mitigated with draw 3 to pick one or buy what you want. More than one legit path to win.

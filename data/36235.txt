This game is like chess, except incredibly tactical and full of unknown possibilities.  Every turn finds you balancing using the units you have on the board, or bringing more in for later use.

It's a great game and has completely replaced Chess for us.

Chess stresses me out. Too much future planning and everything is on the board and your opponent can deduce too much (especially when playing with me). The Duke is very chess-like but you draw your pieces/tiles from a bag so you never know what's coming next. Plus after you move a tile you flip it over and now it moves and acts differently. Great components.

This is chess for the mainstream 21st century.  Skill is alleviated by chance to lift the weight of skill differential that can make 2-player games a drag.

Feels like chess meets Pokemon which is an A in my book.

Downloaded pnp version... I Will give it a try.
Almost finished to translate rules and evaulate it. it's a really interesting strategy game. First impression: great!
After 2 plays: still great. Maybe a bit too casual because of the variety of tiles and the casual draw, so the word strategy means not a so lont-term strategy but more like "use everything you have in play now in the best way you can".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
1st plays: Very cool! The units move in interesting ways, provides that chess feel in a good way without the frustration. Unit variety is cool and even the expansions mix up gameplay in an appropriate thematic way.

2nd plays: The siege units are very fun but tricky to use, and this game is fun and fast. I would describe it as Ameritrash Chess. There's lots of variability and unique units with strong tactical and strategic elements. The game doesn't allow you to think too many moves deep, but core abstract elements of zone control, pinning, forcing and the like are here. It shouldn't work this well.

A brilliant game! A bit like chess, a bit like Hive, and a bit like nothing else. The rules are very intuitive, and gameplay is fun. I wish I'd thought of that design! (Kickstarted in 2012).

One of the best abstracts ever made! I love it along with everyone that has played it so far. It doesn't matter if you don't like Chess (I love Chess by the way) this is going to change your mind about abstract strategy games! Great idea with the flipping tiles that you pull out of the  bag! It's such an elegant and easy to play game. The only drawback is that it's a bit expensive and hard to find. Many expansions that add stuff to an already great game that are very hard to find too. There is also a newer spin off version with a Vinikg theme called Jarl with a bit more defensive bits if you can't find that awesome game available.

RATING: 7
Imagine a game like Chess; played on a 6x6 board; in which you start with just a King and two pawns; where new pieces can be brought on, but they will be randomly drawn from a selection greater than in Chess; where a piece flips after each use, changing what it can do the next time.  The end product is a quicker, lighter, more random game that still engages the grey cells.

The wooden tiles with diagrams of each piece's moves are nicely done.  There is some variation in tone among the dark and light pieces, but nothing so bad as to confuse the two.  The board is plain and functional.  The rules make a hard job of explaining some straightforward concepts.  Their use of illustrations could have been better.

It's like chess where the pieces you get to play with come out in a different order each game and have a different movement template every time you use them.  For these reasons I am really enjoying this game, despite the fact that I've been losing a lot more than I win.

For those who love chance and theme in an abstract The Duke will please. Artwork is good. Rules are relatively simple though a bit lengthy.  However, the draw-from-a bag and flipping mechanic drive me crazy. Just when a strategic plan begins to materialise, the whole thing goes belly up on a draw or I forgot the other side of the tile I moved. Chance driven game that's good for young people and those who hate real combinatory abstracts

An excellent re-imagining of Chess into a highly customizable game with varying troop movement and several alternate forms of game play that involve flag capture and other winning conditions. The wooden pieces are quite simple but elegant, as is the very plain grid board, but you can spice it up by adding terrain tokens or 'NPC' enemies like the Dragon. Also includes blank pieces and stickers you can customize. The sky is really the limit for this system...

Az egyik legígéretesebb logikai játék, amit próbáltam! Esélyes, hogy kedvenc lesz:) Van pár alapelv, ami sakk-szerű, de valahogy színesebb nem csak a sakknál, hanem minden eddigi általam ismert logikainál is. Ami ebben a műfajban szokatlan, az a nagyfokú bővíthetőség, sok-sok fokozat. A legtöbb logikai játéknak van egy viszonylag rövid, letisztult szabálya, előre meghatározott számú és fajta elemekkel. Itt viszont csak a keretszabályok vannak megadva, a szabály nem konkrét bábukat, hanem általános lépésfajtákat ír le, és gyakorlatilag végtelen faja bábu képezhető ezek alapján (a kiegek közt van direkt olyan, amiben "üres" bábuk vannak, amiket a játékosok maguk alakíthatnak ki).
A szinte végtelen variancia ellenére az alapszabály kb. 3-4 perc alatt megtanulható, akár gyerekekkel is játszható szerintem.
Az alapjátékban egyébként teljesen azonos seregek küzdenek egymással, a kiegek tematikát és aszimmetriát visznek bele. A tereptárgyakat és egyéb specialitásokat még nem próbáltuk.
Ami külön érdekesség, hogy 2 oldalasak a bábuk, ezért kicsit lutri, hogy mi vár ránk... nekem ez kicsit a blokkos wargame-eket juttatja eszembe. Idővel persze megtanulhatók a sokszor előkerülő bábuk, emiatt sokat számíthat a játékszám. Nálunk a legelső parti 2 lépésben véget ért... figyelni kell, mert érhetik meglepetések az embert:)
Összefoglalva: nagyon eredeti, a végtelenségig bővíthető, a logikai műfajban forradalmian új játéknak érzem. Egy olyan darab, amiről előre éreztem, hogy jó lesz, és 3 parti alapján úgy tűnik, hogy tényleg. És tetszik a kivitel is!

An addictive logical abstract game, with enough added randomness (tile draw) that takes the edge off of what might be a pure battle of wits. This is not a downside to it, but a good thing as it helps newbies get into it and cuts down the fear factor.

I have also played it with a variation to cut down on the luck aspect where a tile is placed to one side for each player. When recruiting, they can use that one (and replace it) or draw from the bag as normal. 

I enjoy it in either mode really :)

The Duke is still an abstract game but so different than chess. You move along a grid with pieces that move in specific patterns to capture the opponents duke. Sounds like chess, but you start with just three pieces and to get reinforcements you'll need to expend a turn pulling one from a bag. Your army will construct itself randomly forcing you to react to the shift in power and position anytime it happens. The second a new piece comes out memorization of openings won't be able to help you and you'll need to react shift if you want to win.

Ends up being a lot of fun. Seems infinitely expandable and playing with new pieces that come in the box makes the thrill of discovery last a little longer.

I have to say: instant classic. This is a fantastic game. The components are excellent - I love the good size wood parts.  The game is really fun, and the mechanics are familiar & unique. it is like it combines many great aspects of other abstracts into on game. Easy to learn, just set it up with the three starting pieces and learn as you go. Play it once and you've got it. The kids enjoy it, but also scales up for adult play. If you don't have a lot of room for abstract games, make this one a must for your shelf.

10x10 2014. Great chess-like abstract.  The movement of the pieces and how they flip is a brilliant mechanic and makes the game a lot of fun.  For me this feels much more tactical (though less strategic because of the unpredictability of what pieces you'll draw) and much more fun than chess.  I love the variety and different pieces and game variants.  I also like how the pieces look- classy and maybe a little retro- very cool.

A chess "variant". And in the vein of Onitama. 

I would rate this game higher but it gets knocked back because:
1. Constantly flipping the tiles is VERY annoying.
2. $38 CAD for the base game, with numerous built-in expansions at $10 for a few extra tiles: it's a designed & pre-planned egregious money grab.

Superb abstract. The first game I've played for ages that I instantly fell in love with - the first time we played, we played 6 times in a row at my local board game cafe. Reluctant to give it a 10 until I've played it a few more times - but it was absolutely fantastic. Already ordered a copy online.

Since my initial impression, I have slightly cooled on the game - particularly since discovering a number of other abstracts I enjoy much more. I now, sometimes, find the luck that can swing this game completely a little bit deflating but it's still definitely got a secure spot on my shelves.

While I still have a limited amount of plays, I love this game. I don't enjoy chess at all but this is completely different.  There is quite a bit of thinking involved but by nature the game does not allow you to think too many moves ahead (or maybe it does and it's just so difficult that I'm not able to).  Regardless, highest recommendation.

I'm a very big chess fan, but I've let my play lapse over the last few years. Never enough time to really get my head tuned up for a real match.

What a fantastic surprise this game was. If you know how to play chess then the idea of this game is easy to pick up. Each piece has a set of moves that it can make depending on which side of the piece is currently face up. So all you need to do is capture the duke. He can delve into a bag of his friends and forces to bring new pieces to battle which is where the replayability comes in as it is unlikely you will need them all for a game. Awesome game. 2 Plays

Kickstarter backer. I have the game now and I am so happy with the production; nice wooden tiles, solid sturdy box that is the right size, and an attractive but simple presentation. A winner. 

I am hopeful this will be a big hit as the game is addictive and easily understandable---yet there is room for clever play without too much paralysis or scripting of moves because of the tile draws. Every game is different and it has that "Why didn't I think of that" elegance that is so hard to find. Has the 'one more game'  or instant rematch feel to it.

Scratches that Chess urge without feeling intimidating. Plays quickly. I think and hope it could become a real cross-over hit for non-gamers and fans of abstracts alike. I already know I will be giving this as a gift to a lot people. HIghly recommended.

*6* (Initial plays)
First off, I am not too much of an abstract guy. I can tell this will take some repetitive plays to understand all the tiles and sides. It seems good, but I wasn't impressed to the point where I need to play a bunch more. The decision making feels like a typical abstract and it works well. Will play if in the right move.

The Duke is one of three two player abstracts that I own (the others are Yinsh and Onitama). I'm not sure I'll keep all three, but my first play of The Duke might lead me to enjoy it the most of the three.

Like the others, The Duke features an incredibly simple ruleset and brain-burning decisions regarding moving and capturing pieces. The twist on The Duke is that tiles flip after each move with a different movement style on the backside, and tiles are also drawn out of a bag. This leads to a certain amount of chaos and slight randomness, which I actually don't mind.

The Duke felt closest to chess, without all the garbage that I don't like about chess. I found myself mentally checking "if I move here and cover that piece, and she takes that piece..." 

I like it. I might love it. More plays will fill in the blanks.

RATING: 8
A relatively fast and complex strategy game for two players.

The Duke has often been compared to chess endings, and the analogy isn't the worst.  Those put off my chess's apparent lock-step strategies will be kept engaged by the ability to draw a semi-random reinforcement from your stock of tiles.  Chess fans will be enthralled by the movement mechanics of the tiles, which flip between the 'A' side and the 'B' side after every move.

The board is thick card stock and all the tiles are solid and lovely little blocks of finished wood.  The box itself is small, with very little wasted space.

This is a well-designed game on all levels and it is one that everyone should play at least once.

Chess, but faster, clearer and...gamey? The randomised tile pulls gives rise to variable play states and promotes on-the-fly strategies. This is cleverly counterbalanced by a smaller board and the unique movement powers that aren't. Furthermore, making the pieces tiles which despict the movement of your piece is clever design which I really appreciate.
A great gateway for chess players into the bigger world of tabletop gaming, barring human stubborness.

RATING: N/A
This seems right up my alley, but I have some reservations.  With so much information on the board, I think you'd sort of have to choose between enduring monsterous levels of AP or playing non-seriously.  I'm sure you'd eventually become fluent with the game, but unfortunately I lack an opponent willing to get to that point with me. 

Navia Drapt is already heartbreakingly hard for me to get to the table, and the Duke seems simultaneously more streamlined and more fussy.  Less alluring but less off-putting.  Ideally I would own both, but if I did, neither would get played enough to justify it's space.  So I think I'll stick with Drapt.  

Man I wish the rest of the world liked these types of games as much as I do...

I love the idea but just did not enjoy the game.  There were so many pcs and I could not remeber what the hell was on the other side of each pc so if felt like I did not have much strategy.  I wonder if it was a little simpler (fewer pcs with multiple copies) i would like it more.  

Why I got rid of it: I dont like abstracts much.  I really do not like chess variations and this felt like one.

Pretty fun, light, semi-abstract game. The random pieces and the small board seem to give the game a pretty low skill ceiling, which limits the game's value for me. The optional modes like Capture the Flag or the Dragon add new ways to play, but also make it apparent that the game relies on variety rather than depth to achieve longevity (the many expansions available on the release of the base game also show this).

I really like the idea of chess better than the experience. The Duke is far more satisfying for me, and I like the way the smaller playing area creates more action with fewer pieces.

Played @Francis. It's a nice chess-like abstract which plays pretty fast. The fun part is that the pieces have two sides and after every move, they flip, so you should be aware of what the next possible move of the piece is. If you can trap the opponent's Duke, you win the game.  Might be added to the collection, not a must have.

Duke was a fun play.  The movement listings on the tiles are nice.  And the flipping mechanic to vary the options available for a tile was a nice touch.
It was also interesting that tiles are much less effective as they get into enemy territory.  
Duke had a nice amount of strategy.  I would recommend giving it a try if you get the chance.

A unique chess-like game. Every tile has special movement and combat abilities which are written on it. There is no dice. Luck plays a role when you select a random troop tile to add it to your side. After every move the tile is flipped revealing on the reverse side different movement and combat abilities. A player should remember the capabilities that each of his army troop tiles has on each side of the tile. The objective is to capture the enemy “Duke” tile. The game uses simple rules something that puts a lot of thinking into it and makes reaching your goal tougher.  An abstract game with nice components.

I like the base game quite a bit - interesting variation of chess. Very unique idea on piece-movement (flipping a piece every time it moves, different move-style on the other side.)

Two major problems with it. Firstly, a round can bloat significantly, if either side starts pulling in a mess of pieces, which ruins the simple feel of the game. Secondly, and in line with this thought, Onitama. While very different, Onitama hits a very similar feeling, but keeps it's simple feel no matter how deep you take the tactics. I'd always take a game of Onitama over The Duke these days.

(... so, should really get myself a copy of Onitama.)

I like abstracts and I enjoy the Duke.  I like the endless possibilities for expansion, too.  I'd like to play this a bit more with someone who really knows what the pieces can do.  Otherwise, it feels a bit random -> ooh, grab a piece from the bag, let's see what it does.  Oh, I can't remember what the other side looks like, and so on.  I think the game could really shine with two players who know the pieces well.

The Duke is similar to chess in some ways but different enough to make it well worth a play.

One of these days I'll try some of the advanced rules but for now there's more than enough to keep me interested.

A decent abstract game with a chess-like feel, but in a more tactical package. The various abilities of the tiles keep dominant strategies at bay, and the flipping of tiles can quickly alter the board state. There is an element of luck associated with tile drawing that feels out of place, and both players need to be familiar with the fronts and backs of each tile for the game to standout. The package is pretty drab, and have very little table presence.

The key word here is tactical.  The game play feels very responsive, and it's important to check your pieces a few turns out, it's impossible to plan everything beyond 2 or 3.  The random element from the bag actually tempers the game's otherwise cutthroat nature.

I usually eschew games like this. When Keith got it out of his bag, he said, do you like Chess? Nope, I think it's too complex. So, I was more than a little sceptical.

It turns out to be a little gem. The game is like Chess in that you're trying to checkmate your opponent's Duke. And you have a wide variety of pieces to use in many very varied ways. But the pieces have their whole moves printed on the pieces, so it's simple.

Once we got the hang of the small symbols, it became very quick and easy to play. The restrictions on only adding new pieces next to the Duke mean you don't get too many pieces in too quickly. The plan of a piece's options on each piece make it very easy to visualise the options. Flipping pieces was simple, so you could suss out the next possible outcomes very quickly.

Best of all, the random draw made the game very even. You didn't know if the piece you were pulling would help you, or possibly block you.

Our first game was a treat. My Duke went on the rampage, very attacking, and I was way ahead on pieces, meaning Keith started running out of options.

Our second game was much trickier, Keith went on the attack after a good start by me. He then was lucky in the draw, and soon had me pinned against the back wall. But he drew to many pieces, boxed his own Duke in, and a lucky draw of a Wizard got him nailed.

This is going straight on my wishlist and on the clubs. If you like games like Hive, you'll really like this one.

The Duke is an excellent, abstract strategy game not dissimilar to Chess. I've found myself describing it simply as "Like Chess... but better!"

There is an aspect of variability with what units you draw from your bag, and though it seems on the surface that it would make this a more luck-based game, it simply forces players to alter their plans and strategies on the fly. Because of this it's harder to plan more than a few turns ahead, because not only do you have to guess whether your opponent will move and where they will move, you also have to take into account the new units entering the field.

Highly recommended.

The Duke is a great abstract game that I am happy to have finally played! Although I thought it would be a rather chaotic game, The chaos is mitigated by slow tile placement and each flip of the tile can be reacted to if need be. The game actually creates a rather perfect balance of tactics and strategy. I would have never have thought that an abstract like this would work so well.

I am not a fan of Chess.  The idea of memorizing openings bores me, although I can see the appeal of the game.  Maybe I'm not smart enough to play it?  

The Duke, on the other hand, gives me enough randomness to keep it fresh.  The first few plays, the games went very quickly, and my opponent and I wondered if there was too much luck.  Having played it a few more times now, the games are getting a bit longer - still only about 15 minutes - and knowing the pieces has helped mitigate some of the luck. 

I absolutely love this game.  It gives me a fresh abstract to play, as I've somewhat burned out on Hive.

Still loving the game.  Each play is getting progressively longer as we learn strategies and see the potential of each piece.  Amazing design!

My students have gone crazy for this game.  Our games are also getting longer and longer as we get more experienced (although I did lose a game in 2 moves!).

This has become my favourite game.  The base game alone is enough for a massive amount of replayability.  I still love the unpredictability when drawing a new piece.  The tide can turn quickly, but so far, it does seem like the better players do generally win more often than not.

Very neat game.  Definitely prefer it to chess :)  But, due to its randomness (drawing tiles from the bag) can be unpredictably long or extremely short :)  However, this can be mitigated by ordering the tiles (agree with the opponent first, of course).
Nonetheless, strategy is there - and this game WILL make your brain hurt if you want to, in the sense that it can be as complicated as you make it - just as chess.
Enjoy it.

For a game which gets most of its awesomeness from two simple ideas (make an abstract with each piece's moves printed on it; now you can make pieces do whatever you want -- and second, giving the pieces two sides with different abilities) this should be a lot simpler. Instead, the rulebook is a mess and expansions seem to need an ungainly amount of rules support.

Still very cool and quick as a casual game. I can imagine it might be fun for experts or might fall apart; either way, I'm unlikely to pursue it that far but it's nice to have around for the "antic, unpredictable two-player abstract" niche. Which almost nothing else fits into. (Tash-Kalar is close, but it's much heavier.)

Update: Two people with a tiny bit of experience can lock horns and mostly clear the board, leading to an unsatisfying 'reset' that doubles the game length.

Note: This comment is for the Duke's base game & all of it's exps.

I have always liked playing chess and when I saw the reviews and game play, I was excited to play this. I like how the game changes after each move and it allows you with the exp. to custom make you bag of pieces. 

Rating = 7 due to it being fun and challenging and I am willing to play it. It can over-run someone that draws poorly or is against someone more advanced.

A good, two-player abstract game along the lines of chess or Hive. In fact, it's very much a combination of the two.

Players have pieces on a board that move in unique ways. The goal is to capture the opponent's Duke piece. There are two tricks: 1) each time a piece moves, it flips to its opposite side, which changes the way the piece moves. 2) instead of moving, a player may draw a new random piece out of a bag and place it on the board.

The flipping makes planning a little more challenging, and the random draw makes each game exciting and different. I like the game, but I almost feel like there is slightly too much going on. That keeps it from being as smooth and elegant as either chess or Hive.

This game is one of the coolest I have played in sometime.  I love the chess like movement, but the variation comes from the pieces flipping after use, for a whole new move set.  Each piece also has its moves printed on it, making teaching the game a breeze.

All extras owned except KS tiles. Also have custom tiles.

Amazing game! It's a cross between chess and a rpg tactics game. Each unit has different moves/abilities but when you move them they 'flip' over and get a different moveset. A great 2 player game that doesn't take much time to learn but a long time to get good at. Also it's hard to remember the flipped side moveset so it can take awhile when you need to look at all of your tiles. Great game!

An attractively produced Chess/Shogi variant in which it's essential to thoroughly know the capabilities of the various pieces. Some luck in which tiles are drawn (an additional footman at the wrong time can be a game loser as it just traps your duke). OK, it's just an abstract so nothing to go overboard about, but much more approachable than Shogi.

Intriguing game. Only 2 plays don't authorize me to make definite statements.  All I can say is that the game is not intuitive and it's not easy to wrap your head around it at first contact.
It reminds chess endgame puzzles, but it's not scripted (like chess) as you draw subsequent pieces to put on the board randomly from the bag.
Scenarios make the game even more intriguing...

Strong analytical and abstract thinking skills are required here, but there might be room for fun.  If I find it big enough I might buy the game.

This game comes with the tag of "It's like chess but," on it. It's one of those games that you are meant to devote time to in order to pick up on the intricacies of the games various strategies. That said, I do like it more than chess due to the fields ever changing state. Unlike chess where you have the same setup each time, you slowly build your army and move pieces as you are able to. Sometimes you just want to go on the offensive, and other times, adding another soldier is your best bet. Either way, don't play this with people who don't understand strategy at all.

Theme: Medieval sort-of
Gameplay: Abstract game where the movements are determined by the symbols on the piece itself which flip when activated revealing new symbols/movements available now.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2015)

After all the accolades and hype the game received, I was expecting a better game. The Duke is an ok game, but it didn’t excite me the way I was expecting :/.

The rules are very easy, you can explain them under 6 minutes but playtime can be way too long for what the game offers.

The Duke components are gorgeous.

I think the problem for me was that I was expecting a heavier game. As it is, The Duke has its fair share of luck (luck of the draw) but once you have some pieces on the board it isn’t that hard as all the options are plainly visible by both players. If you know by heart all the possible movements of your troops you will have an advantage, but you still have to draw the needed tiles first. The way the tiles move and flip is interesting, but The Duke is mostly a tactical game and I always want a fair fight with my abstract games, so I didn’t like it as much as I thought I would. 

I like that the game has many expansions and variants.

Bottom line, I’m still undecided if I should sell my copy of the game but I’m leaning toward doing so. I would play again if requested but The Duke has too much uncontrolled randomness and its duration is way too long for what it offers. If I’m going to play a 2 player abstract game, I would play Kamisado or Yinsh.

During the fifth game or so, I started thinking about how this might be the only abstract game I'll ever need to own. Clearly that is not true, but the point is this is a solid, fun and interesting game. 

My son Bryce loves playing it with me, and we are about 50/50 on wins. Even with the random chance of piece drawing, the game doesn't feel like it comes down to who draws better, or who has the luck of the gods on their side that day, it still rewards skill and observation.

Overall, I see this game holding a spot in my collection indefinitely, and I plan to scoop up any expansion that is released.

Fans of perfect-information abstracts will likely find the tile draw too luck-driven. Fans of theme will likely find the game too dry.

This game straddles the line between abstract and Euro and does it very very well. If you can stand a bit of luck to spice up your abstracts, then this is an excellent implementation. While luck is present, in almost all cases the better game play will win. The tile draw, for me, really just throws tactical challenges at you that you need to solve in-game. As a fan of both abstracts and euros, I am the perfect audience for this one. My son (13 years old right now) is hooked and my fiance (who also enjoys abstracts) enjoys it as well. This will see a lot of table time around here!

**UPDATE** I have played this many times and I've lowered it a point because occasionally the tile draw can frustrate a tad too much. Still excellent, though.

I'm a fan of this style of game (i.e. Shogi-a-likes) but this isn't even in my top three of such a small selection of games. 
It's got geat production quality but the gameplay falls short of Shogi (larger and longer term strategy), Kings Plate (direct competitor but no silly flipping) and Cheaoss (more chaotic and fun). I'd even consider Navia Dratp an improvement over it.

Simple, fast, easy to teach, and with brilliantly simple twist. A good two-player abstract.

This is often compared to chess. It has three huge advantages over chess. The first is that you can teach it to anyone in less than five minutes. The second is that it plays in less 15-30 minutes. The third is that players of unequal skill and experience can still have an interesting game, without the game feeling random. However, because new tiles are added to the game randomly this may be too random for some people. 

I've introduced this to at least half a dozen people. Everyone learned it quickly. Everyone was impressed. And at least two people bought their own copy within 24 hours. This is a keeper.

A chess-like abstract where the goal is to capture your opponent's Duke tile.  Each tile displays its special moves and attacks right on it.  Once you execute an action from that tile, it flips to the other side and will now have different movement.  Very interesting twist on the game of chess.  You also have a bag that you can blindly pull tiles from to add to the board, so the game can have lots of surprises and twists.  Superb two-player game.

Easily 50 plays deep and I love it more every game. The tile drawing aspect lends a deep risk/reward element, while the tiles' shifting abilities and maneuvering is highly reminiscent of chess without the muckery of a 30 minute opening series followed by 5 minutes of endgame. 

With multiple scenarios, setup styles, and an increasing number of expansions, there's really no issue of staleness.

I really enjoy the strategy of this. Unlike other abstract strategy games I own, this one really is a dance. Each side positions then adds their tiles until kind of a tipping point when someone goes for the attack and pieces start getting removed. I look forward to getting more tiles for it. The bags were pretty much junk when we got our copy so I made my own bags and they're much nicer to use.

I enjoy many aspects of this little game. The design of the wooden tiles is unique and very well done, the game has a strong chess-like feel, but without the infinitely deep decision trees. On the other hand, it also feels deeper and more like chess than, say, Hive. The random tile draw adds a bit of luck, but apart from drawing a footman pretty much every tile seems to have something good that it can do. The relative value of the pieces doesn't feel like the difference between a pawn and a queen, but like the difference between a knight, a bishop and a rook. Speaking of the pieces, that's another thing I like about The Duke: the variety of pieces and the way they move/capture even manages to bring a bit of theme to the table. Was replaced in my collection by the more thematic Tash-Kalar.

Not enough plays to set a "final" rating. As a pretty engaged chess player in the past I find this more entertaining. The random element could end a game pretty fast, but at times the bag is nearly empty before an opening is made for a final blow. Back to the board...

I'm not a chess fan, but The Duke is a fun game due to its more dynamic gameplay and a fun random element (pulling pieces out of a bag). 

The way the pieces work (after you move a piece you flip it over, which means that the next time you move it it moves in a different way) creates a mind melting number of possibilities and situations, which can almost make The Duke a fun quick filler if players aren't taking the game very seriously. 

If played seriously, The Duke still great and the random element makes sure there are no "opening libraries" to memorize.

This game is an excellent abstract strategy. Due to the tile draw, this isn't a perfect information abstract, but definitely close enough to scratch that itch. Due to the way that the tiles show the movement of the pieces, the game is really easy to teach and for new players to pick up. Not to mention I have found that it's great with older kids (ages 10-13) because they don't have to remember what all of the pieces do, it's right there in front of them.

The Duke is a dynamic, tile-based strategy game with an old-world, feudal theme, high-quality wooden playing pieces, and an innovative game mechanism in its double-sided tiles. Each side represents a different posture – often considered to be defensive or offensive – and demonstrates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or after the use of a special ability), the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive posture.

This is my kind of abstract. All the pieces has different moves and they have two sides. So you have near perfect information. It usually starts out casual and suddenly you are deep in thoughts.

Review:

This game scratches the chess itch, but it's so much better IMO.  This has several advantages because it doesn't have chess's set start-up, rigid openings, always the same pieces, and (most importantly!) having to think a lot about each turn, looking forward 2-3 moves on each possibility (if you want to be competitive against people who have played a lot), which results in long games and long downtimes waiting for your opponent.  

You start out with three pieces and the game is about capturing the opponent's Duke.  But--and this is the best part--every turn you can choose to bring a new piece onto the field (in lieu of a normal move).  And there are a bunch of pieces in a bag, so you never know which one you're going to get, and each game you find yourself in a new situation, thinking about how to get these pieces to work with each other.

Each piece is a flat tile, and has a small grid on it that illustrates the ways you can move the piece.  This is very handy, as you don't have to memorize how the units work.  

Another twist is this: each piece has two sides.  On one side are some movement options.  But on the other side are different movement options.  And each time you move, you flip the piece over and have to use the other side next.  So your movement pattern is going to be two different sets of options woven together, 1-2-1-2-1-2.  It's very interesting to plan accordingly and figure out possible patterns.

Also, there are different types of movement, each of which is represented by a different symbol in the grid diagrams on the pieces.  There is simple movement, which requires that nothing is between you and the place you are moving to, and then there is hopping, which doesn't require that.  Then there is sliding, which allows you to move as many spaces as you want in the given direction, and jump-sliding.  Then there's striking, which allows you to attack a piece without actually moving there at all!  There's also fear, which paralyzes enemies.

Even without the two sides, most of the pieces would be more complex than the average piece in chess.  For example, one piece might be able to move to four different squares and hop to two other squares.  And then you flip it over, and the other side is different from that.  Some units are pretty simple, but that's not the rule of thumb.

Having two sides which are both complex doesn't feel very elegant to me.  I wish that there weren't quite as many options on each piece.  That makes it hard to conceptualize, between the two sides, exactly how this piece is meant to be moved around.  I REALLY LIKE the two different sides AND the different types of moving/attacking.  I just wish that each side didn't have as many options in general--that feels overwhelming and not elegant.

Aside from that one thing, I like everything else about the game.  The components are high quality (wood pieces, thick board, and BONUS: a couple of blank pieces with stickers that allow you to make custom pieces).  The design & art is minimalistic but I think that fits for this game.

Also I'll mention, it has some alternate ways to play, with the flag or dragon or mountain.  I've played with each once and they're okay--not a way I want to play all the time, but definitely felt different and worth doing sometimes.

Such a cool/unique take on a chess-type game.  The double-sided pieces makes for a VERY intense abstract brain-burner, which I enjoy.  My only gripe is not knowing the backs of every piece requires me to check the backs of pieces a lot.  It's almost as if I have to choose between slowing down the game to play correctly or make hasty plays to make the length more tolerable.  Minor quibble though.

I've wanted this game for months, ever since I first read about it. I finally scored a copy of it, sat down to play it, and The Duke turned out to be absolutely EVERYTHING that I anticipated: chess-like strategy with just enough luck (the luck of the draw) to keep it fresh and interesting. There are no "hidden disappointments"; it's all that I'd hoped for -- and that's a rare, fine thing in boardgaming.

Way more fun than Chess. The complexity might be overwhelming at first, but it soon fades as you get more and more plays in. I see how it could be stressful to some, but I see it as a tactical puzzle. Since you don't know which tiles you will get, you just have to adapt and play them as best as you can given the current situation. The game also has some of the best expansions in any game; the customization expansion. Make your own tiles and go crazy.

This game is so good!

Small rules footprint, intuitive icons, nice pieces, fantastic length:meatiness ratio, and the delightful tile-flipping mechanic all contribute to its greatness. The secret sauce is the random tile draws, which promote altering your strategy on the fly and building a new strategy around particular pieces, and introduce just enough luck to keep things interesting.

But it's the delicious decision space that makes the game. Several options to consider every turn, plus the flipped faces of tiles on both sides, mean that it's rare to have an easy decision. Every choice is interesting, and there aren't so many choices per turn that it introduces analysis paralysis.

All of that together? Bliss.

I've seen this compared to chess, and while I see why, I found this more fun. I think the addition of randomness makes me feel less stressed about losing (chess is unique among games in making me feel that way), and it makes the game less strategic, and more tactical. The flipping mechanism is neat (and frustrating, in a good way), but does make it a little more confusing when you don't have familiarity with the pieces' movement patterns.

I do not like chess.  Chess is frustrating because I always feel like I would need to sit down for hundreds of hours beforehand studying before I could actually play a decent game of it.

The Duke fixes that problem for me because you're only dealing with three units initially, and the little random bag element makes the game a bit lighter in general.  Sometimes you really *do* get the perfect/worst draw, and that sucks.  Also, the 6x6 grid makes the game much more manageable.  

What is REALLY clever in The Duke though is that each piece has two sets of instructions.  I really like that.  It's brilliantly simple, but really engaging too.  This was my surprise hit of 2013.

Like chess but shorter, simpler, and more random.  I like that it starts simple and gets more complex as more pieces get onto the board.  I like that it might seem like all hope is lost, but then a lucky bag draw can save the day for you.  

I've played 5 minute games and 1 hour games.  Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing though.

I really enjoy this game. Its a chess variant where the board is smaller (more skirmishing from the get-go and throughout)and there is a random drafting of the pieces which are placed as the game progresses rather than advancing from a static setup. 

The pieces flip between two patterns of movement every time they move. I wasn't sure how confusing that would be, or how enjoyable, but it turns out the flipping mechanic works to create a constant engagement in the tactics that taps a part of the brain that chess leaves idle.

This seems like a guys' game to me- I have tried to play it with girls and it didn't appeal to them. It would be a perfect father-son or brother-brother game. 

Although this game complexifies just about every aspect of chess, it is somehow more accessible because the movement patterns of the pieces are printed directly on them. 

There is no denying that the sides in this game are unevenly matched due to the randomizing mechanic, but, within this system, this uncertainty actually enhanced my enjoyment of the gameplay.

Feels a bit like chess, but each tile shows the moves that piece can make. In each turn you can choose a new tile, place a tile on an empty space on the board, or use a special tile. When you move a tile you turn it over to find the movement it can make in the next turn. If you move onto the other person's tile, take it and remove it from the board. Simple, fairly plain-looking.

RATING: 9
Excellent, mostly quick-playing abstract. The ever-changing capabilities of the pieces is very entertaining and makes for interesting tactics. The small board is a virtue, and the game's luck of the draw aspect is fun, even exciting, and keeps play much more light-hearted than that of its stodgy old uncle Chess.

The rules are not as well organized and precise as they should be. The pieces could have been better differentiated color-wise. Own the Arthurian and Howard expansions but haven't used them much yet (the basic game is that rich). [24 plays]

The design is clever, but I can't really see taking this all that seriously. The game is similar enough to Chess that you can use similar tactics to be successful. The random tile draws are refreshing, but undermine how seriously you can take the game.

Similar to chess with random pieces, the duke is a fun two player game.  It is a fun spin on a game I played all the time growing up.  I should probably play with a timer though, or the game brings out some AP in me.   The first couple times the way the pieces flip are a bit hard to adjust to, and may lead to early accidental pins.

Basically Chess for those who want some random elements thrown in. As far as Chess variants go, this one isn't bad, but I found it a little lacking in substance. Drawing special characters from a bag can already lead to some big swings, but the fact that you're just going after the opposing player's duke means that this game can end pretty quickly. I realize I'm not the target audience for this, but I would rather go with tried-and-true Chess over this. This is slightly better than Onitama though.

Played the demo version which was paper and cardboard and probably not as nearly as good feeling or streamlined as the official box, so I upped my review by 0.5 points to 6.5. I definitely think its an improvement over chess. The selection of different pieces to play to capture the enemy duke, the cards' printed movements, and the simplicity of the board are all great.

Some minor quibbles: I feel this could have been expanded to more players like 1-4p or maybe even 5p with an increased or double sided board and some playtesting. I also think the randomness of what you draw from the bag could be improved with some sort of draft. Also, I'm not sure I like the whole "flip after moving" thing - I kinda wish they all stayed on the same side to reduce the analysis paralysis and make the game more consistent. As it is, its a bit too dynamic for deeper strategy or planning (or maybe I just suck at it). Maybe that's a good thing though, so it doesnt become like chess. But I think variable starting position will automatically make this not chess like. If it added more players I think it could be even more non chess like.

The more fun version of chess :D
Plays a lot like chess when moving the pieces, but the drawing of the pieces makes it more luck-based, which makes this a little more variable and therefore more liked than chess. 
The other advantage it has over chess for me, is that there are just less pieces on the board I have to track, so it's a little easier to not overlook something. 

It can still drag quiet a bit when the board gets almost emptied and then everyone is building up again. 
Overall a chess variant that I'm at least willing to play from time to time, which can't be said about chess itself.

[b]The Duke[/b] was traded away in a math trade 9/21/14. (Received The Downfall of Pompeii)

[i]This game had been on my wishlist for a while and then it went oop. A few weeks ago I saw it a local FLGS so I picked it up having never played it before. I was really excited to get it to the table, so my son and I stopped at a cafe on the way home to give it a few plays.

I found it to be somewhat boring and mediocre. I think I might be the problem though, because I don't really think I care for most abstract games, especially ones that feel like chess. The way the tiles move is really cool and the fact that they flip over and have different movement patterns on the back is interesting. However; the game just isn't that interesting. The game wants to be epic and exciting, but you are playing on a small grid where the movement always feels constrained.[/i]

Like chess, but fun.

I was a bit nervous getting into this game initially. I mean, I don't dislike chess, but I feel like you have to keep practicing to get good at it; memorizing moves, working the entire board, etc. It all is just too much for me. This game massively cut down the board size, made it far, far more tactical and even printed the moves on the pieces. This is what I want out of an abstract.

I seriously can't get enough of this game and look forward to trying out the expansions as well as some of the variants. I do worry that I may become good at it eventually and have difficulty teaching it to new players.

The only thing this has in common with chess is a capture element and a squared board.  After that, it is just... meh.  The idea has merit, but the board is far too small and the draw of elements far too random to allow deep strategy.  I initially got caught in the hype, but after a short time found nothing to get excited about.

After two plays - I like it. Too many players on the board limits movement and is a disadvantage. Too few players on the board and the risk of pulling a weak tile increases. Positioning players to drive action to one side of the board or the other is possible. It looks like it'll take a dozen plays to see what it offers. Neat. Like Onitama on steroids.

Amazing new take on a chess like game. Instead of trying to re-invent the game of chess, The Duke decided to innovate. The production quality is great. It has great strategy to it with a tiny bit of luck from the draw of the tile. Really like the flip of the tile to expose a different move set.

This is a chess like game, but rather than start with a board of pieces, you start with only a few pieces. Then on your turn, you can draw a random new piece from the bag. Each piece has not only it's own movement rules, but those rules change after you use the tile, as you flip the tile over after the action. This creates a high barrier of entry, and gives the game a lot of luck in terms of which tile comes out when. It's also very likely for you to make some careless mistakes as there isn't a set number of types of movement for your pieces you can remember. It's not like this is a bad idea for a game, but it feels stressful and isn't that much fun.

The first two times playing this game with my eldest niece I was handed my Duke's head on a sharp spike.

The solution it seemed was to team up with my youngest niece and have her beat my eldest niece - three times on the bounce!

The Duke has some interesting ideas, but I think Onitama does the central idea better--that being various movement powers constantly changing how the pieces can move in this abstract game. My main gripe with the Duke is the random elements of pulling tiles out of your bag--sometimes you grab a tile that's just right and basically (or outright does) win you the game, while other times you grab the worst thing for your situation. If I'm playing an abstract, I'd rather there be no luck. 

I also don't love the look of the game, nor do I think the command power is all that clear to figure out on the tiles--not sure how it could have been better presented, but to me it wasn't easy to evaluate at a glance.

I was so proud of myself for having the self control not to back this on kickstarter. My finger was hovering over the confirm button for one of the higher pledge levels for the final five minutes of the campaign.

A few months later and I'm trying to track down a kickstarter version at much greater expense. *sigh*

Incidentally, I HATE exclusives. Hate them. I have passed up on kickstarters because they had too many game changing exclusives and I didn't want to reward the jack asses who do that. Upgrade some minor components, offer exclusive boxes or swag, but STOP making game changing exclusives!

I want to like this game; I'm a big fan of abstracts, especially those with a random element. But this game has a bit too much chrome for my tastes.

Find the piece flipping mechanic in [gameid=37087] and [gameid=74956], which I much prefer over this.

My goal in 2016 was to really give abstracts, which are one of my least favorite board game genres, a solid try.  I'm glad I did because of Mexica and this game.  I'm not a big chess guy, but this game really makes for great decisions with each tile having alternative powers and the bag building to get more pieces.  I really love it

Like Go, this is a game I understand but am completely incompetent at. I enjoy it, but I fear that the double wammy of not being able to get it on the table often (2 player game) and the hyper complexity of the information tracking will burn it out for me. That said, this is everything that dung heap games like Gosu, Anachronism, and Summoner Wars should be but aren't.

A decent abstract.

Having to randomly pull new units from a bag increases the game's replayability, since you will likely pull different units each game, and/or in a different order.

It does increase the likelihood of one player landing a lucky draw and immediately defeating the opponent, though.

Great strategy game. Easy enough to understand that my 6 year old has fun playing, and complex enough for me to have fun playing.  My only gripe is how easy it is to get a piece stuck, but I guess that just means I need rethink my moves.  Highly recommended.

The game is fast, dynamic, and full of special powers.

The rulebook is verbose yet incomplete, repetitive and yet ambiguous.  I hear the sequel, Jarl, is even worse (and slower paced).  Fortunately, the worst of it is on special abilities not present in the base game.  But why are all those rules written in the middle of the base game rulebook?  A thorough appendix is fine, but confounding an otherwise simple rulebook just to plan ahead for possible expansions is silly.

Too many 'optional' rules for my taste, but that's common for a new designer.  Variants/scenarios are fine, but just tell me how to actually play and stop telling me that I'm allowed to house rule.

Oh, it's a kickstarter.  That explains it all.

like chess, if it were only about rooks and pawns at the start. interestingly, when you move you flip the tile to an alternate move set on the back! in addition to that, a thing i thought i'd actually come to hate, rather than move you could instead recruit from a random bag. turns out, this is quite fun and doesn't tend to swing the game as i'd feared. usually no one is relying on any one single amazing draw, although i have seen some clutch draws (and some immediately useless ones, too). i prefer this over Hive, although i have to admit the bugs are more portable. typically i shy away from direct conflict games like Chess, but this i'm quite happy to bring out with some of my friends as a filler between other activities. i highly recommend the upcoming second edition if it's going to include updates and expansions!!

This is a great two player game. Similar to chess but with more variability and options. It does require some thought and can end quickly if you do not know what each piece does but it is still a fun little game. The price is well worth it. (RW)

Much more interesting and dynamic version of Chess. Starting with only 3 pieces on the board means that everything doesn't start out locked in place, and the ability to draw and place pieces leads to a great deal of variability between games, and prevents standard openings. The way that the pieces flip when activated is interesting, and leads to more dynamic gameplay than Chess, but it's also harder to keep track of what the pieces can do.

Nice twist that feels like chess. Pieces differ every time and you simply corner the opponent's Duke. Fun and fairly in depth for what it is.

The company customer service is terrible though. My game came without a Duke. I had to make one out of the custom piece. I e-mailed customer support 3 times, and even sent mails to individuals on the site that I was directed to and never received any response. Shameful service and I will not be giving my business to this company again.

EDIT, 1/17/15: Still no resolution to my missing Duke tile. Purchased 10/2013 at FLGS.

Egy újabb sakk klón a jobbik fajtából. Az alapjátékban azonos a két fél készlete. 2 kezdőelemmel és egy plusz herceggel kezd a két fél. Cél a herceg elfogása. A játék érdekessége az, hogy egy-egy bábúnak két oldala van, ami teljesen eltérő. Lépésen kívül van ugrás, lövés, mérgezés, áthelyezés is. A lépésen levő játékos vagy lép egy figurájával vagy véletlenszerűen húz egy zsákból egy újabbat, amit a herceg mellé kell lehelyeznie. Emiatt természetesen nagy a játék szerencsefaktora. Erőssége a hihetetlen változatosság. Szép a kivitele is. Kamisadó élményt adott, ezért a pontja is ennek megfelelő.

Meglep, hogy ezt ilyen jóra értékeltem anno. Egyrészt muszáj időre játszani, másrészt  nagyon elhúzódhat és utána egy apró hiba rögtön véget vet a játéknak. Nem éreztem semmit, ami miatt ezt választanám a sakk helyett. Második találkozásra sokat esett a szememben.

This is a cool little abstract where the pieces are nice, double-sided wooden tiles. Each side shows different possible moves for that piece: you flip it after moving. The game starts with your Duke piece and 3 others, drawn randomly from the bag, on the grid board. On your turn, you may either move (then flip) one of your pieces, or bring a new piece onto the board; the new piece goes to a space orthogonally adjacent to you Duke. Alternate turns until you capture the enemy Duke and win!

The game is very Chess like, and similar to other Chess variants (like the very old [thing=645]Bosworth[/thing]) where only a few pieces start on the board and the rest come out in random order. Here, of course, the pieces are not the usual Chess tokens; they have a much greater variety of tokens and corresponding types of moves. As such, though, it would take several plays to internalize all of them. It would also help if the type of move on one side of a token were shown on the other side -- so you wouldn't have to constantly look at the backsides of tiles! 

Pretty cool game, though not for me.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting and fun little two-player game.  It is chess played on a small board but instead of chess pieces these pieces move all sorts of strange and interesting ways.  And to make it even more interesting, after each move with a piece you flip it over and it has a new set of movement patterns.  So each piece on the board alternates between two possible movement patterns.

One of the most interesting things about this game is I find it both more entertaining and difficult for new players for the same reason, simply that they have no idea what most of the pieces do yet.  You are allowed to look at the reverse side of your own pieces at any time but never your opponent's so new players can be surprised by a different piece of their opponents and the movement pattern it reveals after moving into position.  This makes for a more entertaining experience in my opinion (maybe frustrating in other's opinion) but also more difficult as it will be very hard to plan a defense against an attack when you have no idea where or how it might be coming.

One of the best features of this game is it plays in 15 minutes or less.  I simultaneously wish it had a big board (the one with the game is a bit claustrophobic) but also not because while a bigger board would open up the options it would also increase playing time and this is almost the perfect filler for two gamers like me.  Interesting decisions, fun mechanics, and 15 minutes of play time.  The pieces are also decently solid and well made and they include blank tiles to make your own.

As for a negative, besides the claustrophobic board which is both a blessing and a curse, I just feel like if I played often enough and did learn the movement patterns and tile counts of the pieces it would become less interesting and just boil down to a game of chess, and if playing with a new player there would be very little challenge.

A great little chess-like, abstract game. The movements are harder than chess, but since each of the pieces' movements are shown on the pieces themselves, I feel it's a bit easier to teach.

Here's the problem (well, MY problem) with ratings. If I had never played Navia Dratp, my rating of The Duke would likely be higher. Unfortunately, I have played (AND LOVE) Navia Dratp, and The Duke is inferior in every possible way -- with the exception that it is currently available and ND is not.

So, I understand all the high ratings for The Duke. But I'd wager a lot that a significant number of those fans would love and prefer Navia Dratp.

Another one of those "kinda like chess" games that I buy, because I think they are cool.

Unlike many people on Boardgamegeek, I enjoy Chess. I like the strategy, the non-randomness, the symmetry, and the simplistic rules that I learned as child.

The Duke is better than Chess by simply adding randomness, adding more movement patterns, having pieces use a different set of rules every other time you use it, and only having a few pieces on the board at a time.

I recommend this for Chess lovers, people that think Chess is boring, non-gamers, gamers, and anyone with a pulse.

I do think this game lasts a bit too long (maybe we are just bad at playing) and constantly having to flip over tiles to see what they do is annoying.  Maybe after more play throughs we'll have memorized the various tiles better.

Watched a playthrough of it by Watch It Played and it made me miss my chess playing days of youth. It looks like it could scratch my abstract strategy itch, but no idea who I would play it with.

Really cool 2-player game, and I like it, but I never really find myself in the mood to play a 'light' 2-player game. If I was to play a 2-player game it would be hearth, or chess. MAYBE Summoner Wars. But there's not many times when I want to.

The Duke is an abstract game that leverages a simple but powerful system where pieces alternate capabilities every time they move.  

All of the pieces are marked with their capabilities, so instead of concentrating on cards or references, you can concentrate on the board and the flow of the game.

The titular piece, the Duke, has the ability to summon a random reinforcement at any time.

Hands-down my favorite abstract right now.  This is a GREAT game that I could see myself playing 50 years from now.  It is excellent and has virtually unlimited replay potential.

Interesting 2-player, abstract game. Tries to evoke a sense of playing chess,  but a lot of randomness and luck with the main play being tile-draw driven. Not much of a fan.

One of the best abstract games I have ever played. I normally hate chess variants, but this one mixes things up by adding variable movement patterns and "top-decking" for pieces.

I like chess, but it's a game with such enormous skill differences between players that I never play it anymore.  The Duke does two great things to chess - it shortens the game length and it adds a random element to it, while still providing all the 'if I move here, he'll move there' fun of chess.

Fun tactical abstract...a decent amount of luck levels the playing field, but its having to adapt to the luck of the tile-draw that makes this game shine.

Neat abstract.  Kind of like Chess, but with a twist that makes it both quicker and more random (tactical).  Super easy to teach as each piece has it's available moves printed on it.  Terrific components.  I think Catalyst hit one out of the park here.

I've long enjoyed the head the head tactical battle that is Chess.  I was never that good at having to juggle so many pieces though, and the fact that people can memorize strategies and counter-strategies always hindered it in my mind.  For me, The Duke is the answer.  I love the luck element it throws into things, and I enjoy the back and forth swinginess.

It takes a lot for a two-player abstract game to grab my attention, and The Duke has it.  It's very Chess-like, which has been noted pretty well elsewhere, but the way that the pieces flip after movement adds a touch of brilliance to the system.  Drawing the tiles out of a bag adds some variability to the game, at the cost of a bit of randomness that could swing the game, but it seems like the benefits outweigh that frustration.  I'm eager to try this more to see how the games play out, and to try some of the variations and expansions.

I have a hard time getting into abstracts, but this one caught my attention. I think it's because flipping tiles with attack grids printed on them reminded me a lot of Navia Drapt, a fairly obscure chess/shogi variant from a decade or so back. At any rate, flipping the tiles and manipulating those attack grids to trap and capture your opponent's pieces is just a lot of fun. I don't think the chess crowd will like the randomness featured in troop deployment, which is done blind from a draw bag...but I like how that shakes things up and creates a constantly shifting battlefield. I look forward to trying some of the small expansion packs, which change up the battlefield even more by injecting some asymmetry!

Very quick and easy to learn. Random tile selection prevents strategy memorization, and the small board and powerful pieces make for a quick game. Lots of options for customization. I find the wooden tiles delightful to play with.

Haven't played it yet but i am quite curious to try it.
From the explanation it seems:
 - half very original and half "oh no, not yet another *capture my biggest piece to win* !"
 - very replayable
 - very expandable
 - quite chaotic and random

I love the "make your own pieces" idea soooo much!!! 

[EDIT] 2 days later, i was so lucky to be able to try it. What should i say, it is chaotic and very complicated: you simply have too many things to see. I am not a chess lover and this is very "chessy" with some better and some worse aspects: more fantasy, but also to many info to look at. It could be probably appreciated a lot by chess fans but it's not my cup of tea.

I normally despise abstract games since they never click for me, but this is a game that I both enjoy and will ask to play. I love the simplicity of the rules and that the movement of each piece is printed on the piece itself, it makes teaching the game quick and painless. I'm interested in the expansions, but there's a lot of game on this little box. 

I'm looking forward to the expansions and the new (and compatible) version of the game: The Jarl.

Kickstarted, and glad I did (despite the delays)

Fills a nitch I didn't realize existed:
Heavier than checkers, lighter than chess
on par w/ Stratego's complexity but far, far more Elegant. 
 What Navia Drapt should have been, but wasn't quite.
Plays very quickly, and demands an instant rematch.

Excellent.

This one is a bit of a personal sore-spot:
The game is wonderful (and perfectly scratches the tiny itch that lies between
the far too rigorous organized play of Chess and the sheer child-like simplicity of Strategy)
however: I personally backed at the 'Legacy' level.
This meant that I was pledged (in addition to two regular sets)
a custom-crafted "Heirloom-Quality" hardwood set crafted by GeekChic: 
still waiting on that bit.

Yeah.....

Now, my name -is- on the back of every single player board out there,
(as a Duke, no less!) but In rueful retrospect?
My vanity would gladly trade that dubious honor for the promised 
cherrywood GeekChic "Heirloom Quality" set... any day of the week!!!

That all being said? 
I must admit 'The Game' exists, and it is quite good...
(However, the lesson of KS being "not a preorder" was hard-learned.)

Verdict: personal Failure, but I'll grant a Technicality: Marginal Success

I cannot recommend this game enough if you are into Chess variants.  Our gaming crew plays this often.  It is a staple of our board game weekends.

It is extremely flexible with both standard play options and expansions..you can even create your own pieces.  To shorten the game or make it more intriguing we have a draft of the pieces.  i.e. If I draft the Marshall than my opponent most remove his Marshall prior to starting the game and vice a versa until all pieces are spoken for.  

I even recommend playing this in "speed chess" version.  It's a great game to play with a clock.  Also good for those who find chess to intimidating.

The only reason this game doesn't get a 10 is due to the random nature of the piece draw.  You opponent pulls a Marshall then a General and you pull a footman then a pikeman = game over.

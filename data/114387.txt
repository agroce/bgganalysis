Rating based on one play.
Enjoyed it a lot, very close to the board game, but with some extra strategies.
Missed moving around the map, which felt more thematic.
Tomb raiders and thieves added something fun.
The end of the fame took a few of us by surprise, but not sure that would happen on game two.

LIKE: the card digging concept, time track, theme.
DISLIKE: no hard decisions, too much point counting at the end, felt it was too long.
OVERALL: Not sure if this is a keeper. Not enough decisions in the game, felt like game was automatic with two people.
I also feel the game somewhat missed an opportunity to have factual relevance: each artifact could be a real, found artifact with a little bit of history written on it.

Like Thebes, but more random, no board.  Not shorter far as I can tell.  It's actually ok, but not sure why you'd want it over Thebes.  OTOH both fit in the Thebes box easily...

Nice version of the full board game. Easy to teach and to play.
Provides several ways to get victory points. Interesting choices when to dig and for how long. Could be disapointing when there is only trash discovered but only for the digger ...
I gave it already 2 times as Xmas present.

Positiv vereinfachte Kartenversion vom Brettspiel. Kürzere und zügerige Spielzeit sowie bessere planbarkeit (Indianer Jones und Diebe sowie der Ortskundige halten den totalen Zufall beim Ausgrabungsglück fern). Strategischer mit 2 Personen zu spielen aber auch mit 3 und 4 Spielern noch gut spielbar.

I quite like The Tomb Raiders, though I have never played the original Thebes. My wife has, and vastly prefers this version. There's this great push your luck mechanic that keeps things tense, and timing is very important, as you don't want to research too much in any one colour, and not be the first one to search there.

An archaeological exploration card game version of the board game Thebes which also uses the time track mechanism. I owned both at the same time and had a chance to compare head to head. This game distills Thebes down to the core while providing more decisions and more ways to generate points which makes it more interesting. However, 168 tiny cards are very hard to shuffle! Set collection is dependent on what comes out on the board on your turn. I was shut out in a few games in specific colours because they all turned up on my opponents turn so I had no chance to dig or collect exhibitions in those. The game is long so it doesn't come out very often – box says 30 mins...uh, no...our 2p games have never been less than 90 mins, the end game is also a bit anticlimactic and drawn out – most of the good stuff is found, there's masses of rubble in the dig sites, and still about 20-30 cards or so to get through so you find yourself “doing stuff just to do stuff”, it also takes up as much table space as the full board game. Keeper because it's the only game we own with the 'time track' mechanism and I find that interesting.

A completely fine game.  I'd even argue that it's a better game than its big sibling, Thebes.  But I have Thebes already, and it feels way more thematic with the board and bags of artifacts, so one of them had to go.  Thebes: The Tomb Raiders is probably the better [i]game[/i], but the original game captures the theme better, and since both are heavily dosed with randomness, I'm all about the theme for this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
My rating is based relative to the original game. IMO it's not appreciably different and you have to fumble with a bunch of tiny cards. I thought this was supposed to streamline the original game but it most certainly does not. 90% of the game is the same. Not sure if there's any reason to keep this.

RATING: 6.5
Rating based upon 1 play (4 players).  Lots of familiar mechanics from the boardgame, and possibly a snappier design, but I like digging in the bag...  Does what it says on the box, but for some reason I wish I'd played the boardame. One to play more to understand why I feel this way about it.  The lack of exhibitions was certainly one thing I noticed.

The Time Track mechanic is brilliant, and I want to see it in more games in the future. It is such a simple idea that totally enhances game play, because you never know the turn order, and it creates more player choice. This mechanic alone makes me enjoy the game, but also the theme of going on excavations is fun. Two problems I have with the game: the main strategy that will almost always guarantee victory is to buy books. The other problem I have is just the typo on the thief card. I easily get over these problems and gladly play a game.

I find that the changes made to the card game really make the game more interesting and enjoyable. The game still takes up a large amount of table space and the box is still quite large so I wouldn’t really call it portable. I would also say that the suggested playing time of 30 minutes is overly optimistic, in my experience about 20 minutes per player sounds about right.

Very nice adaptation of Thebes to a shorter, card-based game. Maintains most of the gameplay of the original except map movement and now there are only 4 excavation sites. Enjoyed it quite a bit. (Note there is an error in the English rules regarding the thief's ability - should be one random draw - and an error in the card's cost - should be 1/1 time.

A poorly written rulebook lead to a poor game experience. I didn't mind the game but my better half found it to be "a rough game". The game is designed to be a quick version of the full game but it seems that they took shortcuts in doing so.

Hit with the family. Easy to teach and fun to play! Excavations are sooo exciting! 

2 gripes:
*  wrongly printed thief card. 
* gossip card which we do not use AT ALL. It is too expensive to play. We only revert to taking it (cost 1 week) to reveal potentially more lucrative card. We are thinking to change it to thief card 1-3 where you can choose a deck to pick a card from. 

Apart from these minor gripes, it is a really fun game... You are on your toes no matter who is going through the excavation site cards - you or your opponent.  Family game par excellence!

Ez is jó játék, mint az alap, de kérdés az, hogy mennyit ad hozzá. Nem rövidebb a játék és játékélményben is kisebbet kap az ember. Tehát kérdéses számomra, hogy mikor van az, hogy az ember inkább ezt a játékot veszi elő, nem pedig az eredeti táblás játékot.

Superficially similar to Thebes, but with all the fun surgically removed. This is thanks to the neutering of the time mechanism and an excavation system that makes finding artifacts far too easy and certain.

Love the excavation aspect. Revealing the treasures gives a little thrill, and I particularly like that you can also reveal knowledge about other civilisations.

However, setup takes a while, the components end up sprawled across the table, and the game runs on and on and on with little variation after the first 1/3.

Played once.

It is a very shortened version of the Thebes board game, but it has its own flavour.  The game ends immediately when the deck runs out so players must be ever vigilant.

I prefer the board game, but if you are short on space and playing time, this might scratch your Thebes itch.

This is a great card game version of the original game. I think I may enjoy this one more, because it plays faster and the thief and tomb raider cards add an interesting twist. It gives much the same feel as the regular board game, but it also does away with the geographical movement (which was occasionally seriously influenced by luck). I really enjoyed the only play I have had so far.

4/5. Great game. Trades in the bags and map of Base Thebes for a more streamlined, less lucky deck mechanism. Ways to manipulate decks to your advantage lead to some interesting decisions. Probably a more balanced, "better" game than Base Thebes but the lack of map and the awesome bags hurt the theme enough that I would take Thebes over it. Way more compact, though, which is nice. And a lot less random than Base Thebes.

Tényleg nagyon hasonló érzetre a táblás játékhoz. A lapok feltöltési rendszer kimondottan tetszik, szerintem nagyon ötletes. Az ásatások kialakítása is remek, szóval ugyanúgy nagyon tematikus, mint a táblás elődje. Sajnos játékidőben ez sem rövidebb, pedig reménykedtem, hogy hátha valóban egy fél órás kis móka lesz, de inkább 60 perc volt kettesben is. Ez viszont elég hosszú ahhoz képest, hogy milyen mértékű a szerencse benne. Az ember tesz-vesz, tervezget, de aztán azért nagyon meg tudja tréfálni a lapjárás egy-egy ásatási helyszínen. Ez már egy órás játékidőnél is fájó tud lenni. Persze értem én, hogy ez a tematikusság része valamennyire, de mégis, jobban tetszik, mint amennyire jó élmény játszani vele, és azért mégiscsak az lenne a funkciója, hogy játsszunk. :(

A fun interesting archaeology game. Unique time action mechanic: you can grab a card of perform an excavation and you pay time for it, so you have to choose between one long and complex action or many small fast actions.

Somewhat better than the boardgame version (imho), more focused. Nice experience.

I wasn't as big a fan of this game as I was the board game. This definitely seems to move along at a quicker pace, and the luck is mitigated by quite a bit, but the theme really suffers as a result. This also feels just a tad too long for a fairly simple card game. You play until the deck of cards runs out, but since there are cards to dig up sprinkled into the deck, you really have to be careful of how close to the bottom you might be. That being said, I don't like that you can only go on a certain amount of expeditions, and the action cards here are far less interesting than in the board game. There are a lot more points to add up at the end, too, which is something of a detraction. In many ways, this has a lot in common with Lost Cities, but Lost Cities is at an appropriate length while this drags out a bit towards the end. This isn't a bad game, by any means, but I would much rather play the board game if given the choice.

Fun game and I love the theme but perhaps it overstays its welcome a bit.  I wasn't excited about any of my choices during the endgame, as it seemed as if all of the juicy artifacts had already been recovered.  Quite a math exercise during the end scoring as well.  Two-player game.

I need to brush up Mesopotamia and Crete....I was unable to distinguish easily between the two based on the ruins icon identifying them so I ended up (sadly) calling them 'Blue' and 'Purple'.

Pretty good, but it could be a little shorter, at least with two players. The tension usually tends to peak somewhere around a three fourths of the deck so past that it's usually just waiting for the game to end.

--------- Preliminary Thoughts ---------

Great adaptation of the board game into a card game. In fact, it is that good that it makes redundant to have both.

It focuses more on the elements that make the game, and loses some of the theme (the map with the various locations, that is not a core element of the main game, but it's a in important thematic element).

Reduces the luck factor (you can sell bad finds to museums).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very straightforward adaptation of the board game. I have two issues with this: First of all, drawing stuff from a pile of cards is less effective and far less satisfying than drawing tiles from a bag. Second, both the end condition of the deck running out and the exhibition cards hugely emphasize constant excessive digging, without caring about the amount of time units used. Since I find the main points of the original game to be using your time effectively and drawing the right tiles, the card game's approach just feels wrong to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.75
I've played about 1.75 games worth, and that's enough. If it was truly a 30-45 minute game, I'd be a lot more forgiving, but there's far too much randomness for the 1.5 hours it was taking to play.

[b]Thebes: The Tomb Raiders[/b] was traded away with Trambahn in a math trade 1/5/16. (Received Triassic Terror)
Received in a math trade (3/12/14).

[i]- Works well with all player counts (2 - 4) although I find it to be a bit easier with just 2 since there is less competition over the cards.
- Great adaptation of Thebes as a card game
- I really like how the different draw piles refill, you are never sure when the right time to dig is.
- Multiple ways to get vp: most knowledge of a color, museum shows, trading in artifacts and the artifacts themselves.
- Turn order is dependent on how long your actions take, like Glen More and Thebes you could potentially have multiple turns if you take actions that don't cost a lot of time.
- Even though they are hobbit cards, they a really good quality.
- Excellent family game![/i]

The problem with the original boardgame(s) is that you did all this fluffing around the board to maximise your chances of drawing good stuff, and then it's a complete lottery on whether you draw good stuff or not. Providing a disconnect between effort and reward. This card game version does a good job of getting rid of all the fluffing around the board, allowing you to get to the guts of the game as fast as possible, ie getting to the complete lotteries which win or lose you the game. Even then, the game goes about 20 minutes longer than everyone wanted it to, which doesn't speak highly for potential replay. Oh, and it's a lottery.

Has a very similar feeling to Thebes, but I almost liked this one more. I haven't played it with more players, but I feel like it would be more interesting. With 2 players, the deck felt a bit too long.

Notes: Put the 4 fixed thief cards in and threw the others away.

I really like the exploration phase of this.  I'm also totally fine with the luck element of the dig site draws. It feels very thematic.  You can easily mitigate this luck (not always perfectly) and paying attention to what comes out when can help inform how much time to spend on a dig. It's light and fun, with just enough to chew on (timing, luck pushing) to make it interesting.  The major con is that the game runs about 20-25% too long with two players.  The beginning and middle phases are really fun, but by the end of the game there are fewer interesting decisions about what to pick up and whether or not to dig (if you still can). The order in which the cards come out can also lead to some odd lulls, where there isn't much that interests either player.

Great distillation of Thebes. This is a game that I continually lose to Jennifer, but have a good time doing so. It's really fun "digging" through the deck of cards looking for artifacts. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The good thing is that when playing this, you really feel like playing Thebes. But maybe it feels a bit too much like Thebes? The way they introduced the artefacts into the draw pile is done very well and there are some extra 'bells and whistles' in the form of action cards and the musea, but it feels the same as playing the regular Thebes. And personally I prefer the excitement of drawing chits out of a bag :)

For me this card game is an excellent alternative if you don't have the boardgame yet (who is out of print unfortunately), or if you want something more compact to take with you on holiday, but otherwise you don't need to own if you already have the 'real' Thebes.

Did not play the board game, but this card game seems to work just fine. Once players get the hang of it, the games moves fast. It's fun to discover treasure and make a hefty collection. Never did mind that much the significant luck aspect. I like that there's enough ways to score points. Down side might be that at some points everyone just collects books.

If you like Thebes you like this. If you haven't played either then you should go play Thebes. It is a nice game but all in all it just made me want to play Thebes more. The card game is almost exactly the same and only slightly shorter in play-time. it needs to be much shorter to warrant having both. I will probably end up trading my copy away. I want to try with 2p and see how that goes. Very enjoyable, regardless.

There is no reason to own this game if you own the original board game version.

This game has two features that annoy me about many card game adaptations of board games:

1. It takes about the same amount of time to play this as the board game

2. It takes almost as much table space as the board game. The card game is actually worse than the board game when it comes to the organization of components as there's no board to help you line up the cards that you have won.

The card game successfully distills and streamlines the original game, while giving the players tools to mitigate much of the potential frustration associated with digging for treasure (my main concern with the original).  I have no problem losing the map (and the need to travel around it), when the overall result, IMHO, is a shorter and more satisfying game that is a lot of fun to play.

Update after 7 games:  despite its improvement over the original, the luck of the draw still often plays an extremely large part in determining the final scores.  Thankfully, the game is short enough that it doesn't hurt THAT much when you get a really bad draw (or two).  It is still annoying when it happens to you, though.

This is an interesting card game that really has a little brain burn to it.  It also has a race mechanic to get the artifacts before your opponents in order to fulfill a presentation or museum card.  I love the time mechanic where you don't just take turns but you spend time and if you surge way ahead then you may not get a turn for several rounds.   Compared to the original game I prefer this one.  I just think the theme is still present and well used while the mechanics are much more enjoyable.  There just seems to be more balance between strategy, tactics and luck rather than heavy luck with respect to the original. One bad to this one is that is much longer than 30 minutes...more like 90.  this is too long for what it is.  Just wish it was a bit shorter.

The time track is a good mechanism. For a card game, the digging part is random but that fits the theme. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great variant to the main Thebes game in a quicker, more portable game, but maintaining the theme and overall feel of the game. It seems like a strange game decision to make the distribution cards and specialist cards the same size as the main cards cause they keep ending up shuffled into the main deck, but that can be easily fixed by printing larger cards or using sleeves for those few cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Less random because it does away with Thebes' swingy treasure dig bags. Instead you draw from a pile of cards. That's still luck-based, but the luck of the draw at least appears to be a little more manageable. Loses some flavor and theme on the way, though. Which is, by the way, not there: you don't travel around on the map anymore. 
However, this is not in any way shorter nor does it have a smaller footprint than the original game. The 30 minutes the publisher gives you are impossible. This is more like an hour or more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There are improvements here that could have been incorporated into an updated version of the board game, such as the growing stack of artefact cards and some of the action cards. The donation to museums of low value finds and improved exhibit costs are also nice additions. They'd improve on the board game nicely. In this card game version however you do feel as though it's missing the geographical travel to the different cities and dig locations. The game setup drags with the extra good shuffle you have to give the cards before play. So it's a bit of a win and a bit of a loss.

The game works well with 3-4 players, but with two players the professor competition and oversupply of knowledge makes it fell like it runs a little long. The misprint on the thief card is more annoying than I thought - I see how they got the cards confused during production - so imagine how confusing it can be during play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I was hopeful after seeing reviews and reading the rules that I'd like this more than Thebes, because I tend to prefer card games. After playing, this was just not as fun at the board game, despite being nearly mechanically identical. A good try, but I'm sticking to Thebes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's very similar to the board game. The card mechanic that replaces the excavation bags is very good. Traveling to locations is omitted. Some improvements and new mechanics are present. But overall, this is just like the board game.

That sounds like a compliment but I mean it as a criticism. The game takes too long for a card game. It almost takes as long as the board game. I expect a card game adaptation to streamline the board game and make the play faster, but this fails in that goal. It feels too similar to the original experience, and almost as deep. 

I buy a card game version to fill the moments when I have an itch for a full game but don't want to make the time or brain power investment. This game should be lighter. This is a good game, but when I'm playing this I wonder why not play the full Thebes instead?

Consider this more of a Travel edition. The only reasons to play this version are you're traveling with it, you prefer the mechanics in this over full Thebes, you hate pulling from excavation bags (how is that possible?!) or you just freakin' love cards.

I have never played the original Thebes board game so I am not able to compare this game to it.  That having been said, I liked this game for what it is.  While playing, I did feel like I was gaining knowledge and pushing my luck in digging for artifacts.  There's a bit of strategy involved and I had fun playing and try to figure out the game.  I like the mechanism of spending time to acquire cards or take actions and how that affect the turn order.  The game is easy to learn, teach, and play.  However, there are several less than ideal things to consider: 

(1) Setup and distributing the cards from the deck can be a bit tedious and distracting for the player in charge of managing it.

(2) Remember to count up and pass around the Professor bonus cards is annoying and distracting as well

(3) Each player tableau does take a up quit a bit of space, but since cards overlap, I don't think it was really necessary to use the Mini Euro size cards; larger ones would have been preferred.

(4) The Thief cards are misprinted (see below).

----------

The most disappointing thing about this game is the production quality.  The box, board, and tokens are fine, but the misprint on the 4 Thief cards is REALLY disappointing. It's interesting that not only are the cards themselves misprinted, but the images of the cards in the rule book and on the front of the box are also wrong as are the rules for the card in the book!  It's not clear if this was an unintentional misprint or if the publisher made the choice to chance the card function and cost since the rules for the card are also wrong in the rule book.  Regardless, it makes sense that the Thief cards should have a cost of 1/1.  Given that the publisher seems to be unaware and have no ETA on a solution, I only see two options to correct the cards:

(1) Sleeve all the cards and slip in a printed, self-corrected copy for these cards. The issue with sleeving 168 of these mini cards is that they then won't stay in the stack without falling over.

(2) Write on the actual cards. There's no going back with this option.

The game is tricky to play without fixing the cards in some way. We tried to play with the way there were and just to call them out and remind of the cost when they appeared in the market, but it ended up being a mess since they look so similar to the Tomb Raider cards. As a result, people got confused over which card was which and what the actual costs should be.  This is frustrating and disappointing.  Hopefully Queen with offer replacement cards soon!

Thebes: The Tomb Raiders does a nice job of reducing the board game Thebes to a minimalist card game while keeping in tact much of the feel and flow of the original.

The gimmick with the original Thebes was that you could dip into a bag of discs and perhaps pull out a treasure at any moment--right up until the site was obviously exhausted.  Here there are only cards, and just a single twist that flops:  treasures drip into expedition decks slowly across the game.  Expeditions now regularly fail because their decks are empty, and how can you find what hasn't arrived yet?  With all of the shiny components now boring cards, this version is pointless.

A fun twist on set collection, I really enjoy the little bit of luck element of treasure hunting through the decks.  Actually feels like less luck than a game like Jaipur since you have a good idea what's in each deck as you go, and you just have to decide when to jump on an excavation or hold out.

For such a small game, it demands a huge amount of table space.  There's a little too much fiddliness with constantly having to assign cards to areas.  The rulebook is easy to follow, but omits some obvious questions.  There's a pretty glaring misprint with the thief cards.  Probably my biggest beef with how the game is played though, is just how long and boring it is to add up points at the end.  Kind of sucks the enjoyment out of a pretty quick game.

All those aside though, the game is light fun, no real interaction, just a race to grab cards and search for treasures before your opponent(s).  I really love the time mechanic for deciding turns.

A streamlined Thebes. There are a couple of tweaks and additions to this version that I thought were really good. First, the Museums give you a way of permanently trading away artefacts for a specified number of bonus points. This gives you something useful to do with your low-value treasures if you haven't got enough to put them into Exhibits. The Exhibits themselves have changed too: instead of requiring a large set of coloured treasures, you can claim an exhibit with fewer treasures but you have to spend more time to do so. Adding extra treasures as indicated on the Exhibit card will reduce the length of time taken to grab the card. Both are nice improvements on the system.

The game is quick and fun but not sufficiently different from Thebes to own both.

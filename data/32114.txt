This reminds me of Scripts and Scribes for some reason.  Real sleeper hit.  Simple, deep (but not too deep), a solid reduction of an economic/stock-holding game.  I knew it would be fun after reading the rules, but not as much fun as it was.

Downside is, it will get old quicker than more complex games.  But hey, it will be a good ride!  And it's wicked easy to teach people.

RATING: 7
Not a bad filler for a quick game with a simple set of rules.  The only problem is the color of the cubes in the game (Catalyst Labs version).  I have a friend who is slightly color blind and the two shades of yellow and two shades of blue make this game unplayable.

RATING: 5
A competent, utterly forgettable stockmarket sort of game.  The theme is 18th century trade, so you earn "dividends" from commodities in the holds of your merchant ships.  The amount of each dividend is determined by card play.  Additional bells and whistles are extra ships, extra card drawing and bonus dividend abilities available for purchase.  Most money when the deck runs out wins.

Quick playing trading game that allows for asymmetry via specialization in buildings. I'm not sure how interesting the decisions are though. Played several games two player and we determined that it was crucial to obtain the extra card building first, while the others the decision was mostly in what order. With more players these decisions would be tougher as there would not be enough buildings for everyone. I prefer Traders of Carthage for the same multiplayer trading card game genre though.

Mild and inoffensive.  Ranks alongside Knizia's simpler games like En Garde and Lost Cities -- and there's nothing wrong with that.

With four players, the game was over much too quick and each player had so few turns.  Two would be a little tit-for-tat.  I think three would be ideal.

I like that the publisher tried something different with the packaging.  It works pretty well.

I'm not a big fan of games where your best strategy is to effectively just follow what everyone else is doing and try to suck out tiny fractional advantages where possible.   That is what this game is about.

It's a very reactive, rather than strategic game, which is why I rate this a 5.

Another Knizia market game with the same weakness as the rest: draw what other people have and you score well; draw what nobody else has and you score poorly.  Similar to Palmyra only quicker and with a little more control because of the special action cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Or, in English, 'Bandwagon-Jumping'.  There's more to it than that but 'switch and score' always looks a tempting tactic and it's hard to make much money from bucking the trend, though the real key seems to be deciding on the best timing to do just that.  A very decent light filler with some tough decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Typical mid-tier light Knizia: push your luck, try to anticipate your opponents moves, simple to teach but clever in play. At the end of the day, I don't know how much game there really is here; certainly not a ton. Most moves are fairly straightforward, but the trade-offs are interesting. I think this is probably ultimately a bit too light for me, I'd rather do a Colossal Arena (which this has a vague family resemblance to) or a Strozzi (similar in weight class but with a little more going on).

5 plays (4p, different sets of people)--excellent game. Seems a uniquely compressed medium weight game--compressed with (a) light rules, with (b) both tactics and strategies packed within (c) a short time of game play. Quite a lot of fun to try out different strategies. It has the good eurogame feature of wanting to do two conflicting things--buy special powers but having to give up victory points/money. In one of my games, I bought a 3rd ship, a contract, and an office, and then started obviously accomplishing lucrative trade after trade for 70 points, yet lost to a player who bought no special powers and quietly achieved a total of 71 points. Another factor in this game is the competitive cooperation of scoring goods in common. And we have the gameplay satisfaction of two actions per turn. I imagine, but don't know, that Merchants is better with more players than less. The game does feel like it ends too soon, but maybe this is in the balance a good thing. I don't know if I've seen such compression of full game factors before. I impatiently had to destroy the fussy Merchants of the Sea box when opening it, so keep the game in a Girl Scout Cookie box. Ulrich did a nice job with these money screens: http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/34814/money-screens-for-handelsfursten

RATING: 5
A great light, short game when played with two. We've often taken it with us when traveling. Very unbalanced when played with more than two, because the upgrades are too finite that the first two players to gain money (which could be due to being lucky in card draw) will probably be the ones to win.

Fast paced group game that is easy to teach & get rolling.  Good components that help keep track of what is going on.  I like the player interaction, but I think the strategic decisions are a little limited...which makes it a little too dry for me to want to play it a lot.  I would like to play one more time, though, just to make sure I still feel the same way.

Solid card game filler.  Players are medieval merchants who speculate on a market of six goods cards.  Players load/change a good on their ships, then adjust the market to try and trigger some cash flow.  There are six types of goods in the game, and 10 cards per good.  Cash can be reinvested back into more ships (i.e. goods), or other technology cards for powers.  Of course cash invested is also victory points invested.  

Great little game, really enjoyed it.  Recalls other Knizia games with temporary alliances, such as Trendy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Super quick, a little something different from Knizia for a change, makes this an interesting filler.  However, it has a TON of back-scratching, which is one of my least favorite mechanics.   It all comes down to timing the scoring of your colors.   It's kind of like a quicker version of Bohnanza, but when you score a color, all players score for that same color.

Intriguing simple mechanism, but hard to control if you don't have a run of cards. Draw a set of different cards and you're lagging.

With 2 players seems a little repetitious.  I think with 3 or 4 players will be harder to plan ahead, but I think it should be more interesting--mixes things up a little more.

One play with two, one with three and one with four. A fairly light game, but one that provides fun and interesting stuff to do and think about. Players are merchants bringing goods to port while at the same time manipulating demand with their hand of cards. They can enhance their little operations by expanding their fleet, opening offices to let them better manipulate demand, hiring dockworkers which allow them to exchange goods more quickly, and signing trade agreements that bring in more money per transaction. Meanwhile there's a lot of player interaction as players try to eke out points for themselves without giving away too many to anyone else. 

In the final end there might be a hair too much luck for this one to be a standout in the collection, but even so it's an enjoyable play. Also worth noting is that it plays well with any number.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Easy game where you try to score yourself many points as possible and the opponents so few as possible, as all will score. There are a few downsides. The rules are leaving gaps (example: how many ship cards are in the game of 2/3/4 players?). The game ends when there are no more cards to draft, but in my games, after two thirds all the money coins were used up (and the game ended therefore) with 3 players. On the other hand, when played with 5 players the game ends so soon you cannot buy and profit from one of the bonus cards. So the sweet spot seems to be 4 players.

An interesting groupthink game similar to Trendy and Masters Gallery.  I do terribly at this game!  You want to go along with the pack and score when everyone else does, while at the same time you need to score more than everyone else.  The special cards are a nice touch - they are expensive enough that (like the third bean field in Bohnanza) I'm not sure if they're necessarily worth purchasing.  At least in a 4-player game, it's hard to know whether or not it will pay off.

The main knock on this game is the lackluster theme and art.  Come on, this theme is as tired as they come.  And ugly too.

12/20/14 Played a three-player game in 25 minutes. Catalyst Game Labs version. 
Merchants is a nice little filler with some very poor components. The cubes are hideous (non-uniform colors, unsquare cubes - they practically scream factory seconds), the special cards have no icons so you have no idea what they do unless you're told. The goods cards are adequate. The money chits are passable but somewhat non-uniform (some of the 5's are gray and some are silver); all are the smallest coins I've ever seen. Even the game box is weird (it reminded me of a roach motel!). None of the physical aspects keep it from being a good game. But I do have to take a couple of points off my BGG rating for them. I rated the game a "5" on BGG. I would be quite willing to play it again, as at 25 minutes it did not overstay its welcome.

This is my favorite game from 2007. Very intriguing group-think game which is derived from Ferkelei. I really like the basic mechanic which is quite robust and has original feeling to it compare to other Knizia games.

There many clever play you can do and also card-counting is essential to play better. I also like 3 different special cards that adds long-term strategy.

This game is one of the peculiar example: it is very popular and appreciated in Japan but not else where.

Now I played this game 105 times. So it is time to raise the rating from 9 to 10.

An excellent example for separating between tactics and strategy as well - there is no obvious winning strategy but a balance between optimising each move, preparing a possible defense for the next turn and setting up the right help cards early on to maximise the gain in latter stages of the game.

Nice little economic game. You are picking up goods on your ships that you hope to trade by using your cards -- the trick is to trade when it's going to get you more money than your opponents. I enjoyed my first play.... though I found the packaging -- a box in a box in a box to be a little on the strange side.

Surprisingly good game. Added it to an order on the basis of it's theme and mechanic-type but no other knowledge of it. It's about commodity value manipulation, speculation and trading. Anticipate what your opponent is doing and take advantage of commodities they aren't prepared to trade in, buy buildings judiciously to compliment your style and try to get more money than your opponent.

I especially liked this game. It has massive re-play value, its fast and fun and everyone has a good time.

Dan and Liz and Mindy and I have all played it together a few times, doesn't seem to get boring either.

Recently I played a game called Bombay, which is Merchants times 10. Same cubes and other cubes to, no cards, no upgrades, more markets and a map to move around on.

Which is interesting... I thought what was cool about Merchants was the upgrades, but Bombay took em away and added a map and got rid of the demand cards (replaced by demand cubes- so simple! lol) and suddenly the game is actually more fun because no one has an advantage...

If I had to pick, I would say,
Merchants when time is short or youre not in for a longer game (30-45min)

and Bombay everytime there is a little more time to play because it is superior in almost every way to Merchants.

Merchants does have small carrying size going for it and quick play time and the cool upgrades for re-playability. And its cheap.

One bad thing about Merchants, it seems to end suddenly. Maybe with more playtime under my belt I could prepare better or see it coming, but its like oh crap its over!

also, players like Dan and I have a strange advantage (MTG players) because we can find ways to manipulate the deck against the other players... like by getting the extra card draw early and burning the deck out the first chance we get when we are ahead by 1 point etc.

Anyway, I like it. Small, quick, and easy to learn. :P

I was a little disappointed by the game. Well, it is a nice game, but I find it a little bit uninspired and you can't really interact with your co-players. So you sit there, trying to optimize your strategy, there are no real surprises or fun parts, so the game is actually a little boring in my opinion.

Best with 2 players, imho. Not so easy as it looks, to take part in most of the other's scoring rounds, while keeping the competitors out of one's own scoring actions. The shortage of special cards (with 3 or 4 players) induces painful decisions, and I still have to figure out the best strategy. 

Great new card game with almost the feel of a big box game. Good overall quality of the game  parts and nice artwork make this a worthwhile purchase.

2 to 4 player economic card game. Play cards of a commodity type to alter demand for various goods and trigger scoring, whereupon every player who holds cubes of that commodity get to make profits.

This is an economic game boiled down to its most basic essentials. A lot of room for making alliances and backstabbing people; there is no way you can win by working only with yourself. Probably the simplest economic game out there, and that is a good thing, as it retains some of the most important principles. This would probably be the filler of choice for people who like Chicago Express, Modern Art etc.

Has some decisions I like. Going for a risk-free payoff on your turn, vs. posturing for a potential windfall by trying to score on other players' turns. The importance of each varies a lot between the 3 and 4-player game (more players = posture more). Bluffing. The weakness is this game feels ash-dry to play.

Player takes 1 action each in two phases.  Phase 1: a) trade cube on ship; b) purchase specialty card (new ship w/produce cube; deckhand giving extra cube exchange per turn; Trade Office gaining extra card draw per turn; or contract/agreement winning two extra coins when selling goods; or 3) pass.  Phase 2: a) draw 2 cards; or b) play a card onto table gaining coins = # of cards matching color played X # of cubes on ship of same color.  Color on cards and cubes represent products in demand.  Each player starts with 2 ships each with maximum 1 color cube and 3 cards.  The game begins with 6 cards face-up in center of board.   Game ends when draw deck expires; player with the most coins wins.

Merchants is a solid Knizia card game. With so few cards in the deck, luck of the draw plays a role, but the winner is likely the player who best manages his hand and most effectively manipulates the stock market. My only issue is with the components: the game is unplayable if you're at all colourblind or in a room without bright light.

A delicious card game by Knizia. There's much interaction, because it's very important to watch you opponents' actions and try to profit most of them. The different action cards provide some extra variability, which further increases replayability.

Simple, yet subtle, this is a vintage Knizia.

RATING: 9.5
This is a very solid and fast-playing stock market game.  There is luck in the card draw, but not much compared to the market manipulation, control of game-length, and cornering market-deliveries.  You can play with open scoring which will slow the game slightly but make it more strategic as you know exactly how much you need to swing player scores AND how much you can afford to work with those behind you in score.  Closed scoring makes this much more ambiguous, obviously. For that reason I strongly recommend playing with open money--all you'll do with closed scoring is either force an uneeded "memory element" or barring that just add more randomness to your decisions.


The beauty of the special cards is that they can both help and hurt you since they are worth nothing at the end.  It is possible to win the game purchasing nothing but 1 extra boat, while watching your opponents spend their hard-earned cash on "abilities."  When you run out the deck rapidly, they'll be left wondering how their cards could've been so worthless. 

This has the 'work with your opponents stock manipulation which I had hoped for with Hab and Gut, and it plays faster and yet still feels like a deeper game.  The game benefits from those who can step out of group-think and play different strategies since so many will produce a win in games where everyone proceeds "as usual."

A quick stock-market card game with deceptively simple rules but which requires a bit of thought to play well. You need to pay attention to what other players are investing in, in the hope of scoring both on your turn and theirs. You can also invest in additional abilities, but these cost cash which is also VPs.

You try to sell goods. You can buy special cards, but the game is very fast, so you don`t have time to use them all. 

When you sell goods everyone who has this good earns money. So you can try to take goods, they will be sell, but the "good" goods change (the players who don`t have the good good will sell a diferent one).

Ok a very fast game, but it seems very luck dependend and it is not a party game.

A typical Knizia game, Merchants: Lords of the Sea is fairly lightweight and sports simple mechanics but presents players with tough choices and has a little bit of hidden depth. With most other designers, this would be a gem. For Knizia, its just one of a dozen or so games that I'd categorize as fillers but not fluffy. It's interesting enough that I want to add this to my collection despite having a number of Knizia games of similar weight.

Merchants is a fairly straightforward Reiner Knizia game. There's a display of cards showing some collection of goods. There's something like six different types of goods. You start with two ships, each of which can hold a good.

On your turn, you can build a building or switch a good from the supply (which starts with 5 of each good) to your ship (throwing whatever was on it back to the supply). Then you can play cards to the existing card piles, as many as you like, or draw two cards.

Any time that a player plays cards to the card piles, there's a scoring round. Every player counts how many goods he has and multiplies that by how many of those goods are showing in the card row. You get that many coins, which are points at the end.

There are some cards you can buy which give you nifty powers, but some of them are limited so that not every player can get them. There are ships, which are almost unlimited, and allow you to hold another cube, and in fact come with a cube. There are buildings which give you a free card a turn. There are cards that give you extra coins whenever you score anything. There is a card that lets you switch an extra cube between your ships and the supply on your turn. You can only buy one a turn, but you can have multiples of the cards if you desire and if they're available. The game ends when the card deck runs out.

The game is fairly simple, but clever. It's very much a light filler game, but hits that note fairly well. I don't know how much it'd hold up to repeated plays, but it was fun.

The packaging, at least for the version I played, was pretty ridiculous. It came in a box, which when opened had a cutout window showing... another box. And when you opened the second box, there was... a third box holding the cards. Not only was the packaging wasteful, it was also just not good. I can't imagine anyone who would prefer this box over something more typical. The game could easily fit in something about the size of two standard card decks.

Every player starts with three Good Cards, two Ship Cards and one Goods Token on each ship corresponding to one of the six Goods Cards in the game: Indigo, Fur, Corn, Lumber, Fish and Cotton. Every turn a player may draw or play various cards. This can change Goods Tokens on player's Ship Cards, the face-up Goods Cards on the playing area, trigger scoring, and so on.

There is really no way to plan ahead in Handelsfursten.  All you can do is to divert your commodity cubes in the hope that it is of the type your opponents intending to score next.  Although you can completely invest in a color before you fill up the demand with the same, it also means you will miss out on other people's turn because you won't be able to leech off of them.  Very tactical; with its ease to pick up and quick to play as the only attractions.  Otherwise, nothing really inspiring here.

They don't get much more "brain-burnery" than this. Some of the rules take a while for you to get your head round and this is a deep game but with lots of opportunity to screw your opponenet. probably a bit too tactical for my overall taste as the options to play strategically are limited but worth exploring more

I've played some real brain burners this year, and this is among the cream of the crop. Three rounds of deliciously agonising decisions and razor sharp elbows. Could be a solid gateway to 18xx.

Minus points - perhaps only temporarily - for the somewhat obtuse building rules which made me feel like we were playing an Alban Viard game. Although that's a very positive thing overall.

RATING: 8
Tile-laying, set collection, route planning, and a somewhat unique action selection mechanic come together to make a good gamer's game with a decent theme.

The game is played over 3 rounds, and each round consists of: auctioning for player order, selecting gem order cards (a major way to score points), playing actions (you have 12 actions to choose from, and a turn consists of playing 1-4 of those actions, making for some interesting pacing decisions, and you will play ALL 12 actions), collecting gems (prospecting, your last action), city scoring (another way to score points), dynamite explosions, fulfilling order cards if possible, and gem auctioning (another way to score points).  Repeat for 2 more rounds.

This is long awaited return by Kramer to deep gamer's games.  It definitely feels reminiscent of games like Java (lots of AP, action selection), and has a hint of Bison with the way the actions are selected.  The theme works well and the game scales well from 2-4 (although length/AP is a real issue).

I liked this quite a bit, actually. It plays reasonably quickly and has a lot of depth. The actions are basically scripted (and you're going to want to use them all), but the ordering is essential. It has that great mechanism in which you can develop something (a vein, in this case) but have to worry about others jumping in on it. A really nice game arc. The gem collections (that you turn in for points) are nice as an objective, but the market is truly the thing here. Add to that a nice spatial / route planning element.

It's a really, really solid game.

RATING: 9
Wow, just wow. I give this game major props for incorporating so many different ways to "play" your options, and mess with your opponents in so many ways. True, my first game suffered from major AP because all the players really wanted to understand the game and the many different options on each turn. Unbelievable permutations.

All the players were kind of in awe of the option permutations, but I think we also reached a rough consensus that this game could benefit mightily from the use of a player turn timer to speed the game along. Our game took over 3 hours.

Curiously, this is a game that is perhaps hard to really love (not sure if there was sweet spot in there), but man, I respect this game for all the layers of screwage piled upon screwage.

After one play, I give this game a 9 simply out of respect for all its screwage layers, and want to play it again (with a timer) not because I find the game addictive or amazing, but out of an amusing respect for the designers' unflinching unabashed headlong dive into a sea of permutations. Want options to screw with the state of play on every single turn? You got a ton of them here. Interestingly, playing this game shows that it is sometimes just fun to swim in the peculiar world of a complex game...kind of a new experience for me.

What a long strange trip this game provides!

The limited and mandatory menu of 12 actions per turn makes this one real interesting. Unfortunately, C-- had a bad turn early on (sort of my fault, because I blew up one of her tunnels with dynamite without realizing the impact it'd have on her scoring), and struggled to get back into things. It's unlikely to hit the table at home any time soon. Gotta try it at game night...

This is a rather innovative design, as far as my collection is concerned: it has train-games-like map building, with the unusual twist of dynamite; there's set collection (but the orders seem quite un-impacting) and a small amount of auctions... It won't be played too much due to its weight and tendency to analysis paralysis, but it's a good game indeed.

I really enjoy Cavum.  One minor knock is that the bidding for Sequence Tiles and the selling of Precious Stones lacks tension the first time you play.  However, with more experience, stronger bids are made so that players are less likely to sell stones for 7-9 points and/or win start player/last player for 0-2 points.

There is a lot to like about Cavum.  The timing of your actions (ala Bison) and the tile/route planning (ala Java) makes this a good alternative to my usual fare of Kramer Action Point games.  Cavum also has an even wider range of possible actions than Bison, so with more experience I can see myself really loving this game.  

Cavum is for the most part Kramer's reverse take on Age of Steam.  I prefer Cavum to the standard Rust Belt map of Age of Steam, but AoS will probably win out in the end for there are plenty of expansion maps that offers a wider range of scenarios.

YTP - Just love the idea of the mechanics here.

2012-12-10 - Finally on the table - 3 player learning session, so just got through 2 rounds

2012-12-14 - 3 player, full game. Generally like the mechanics, and realize we'll have to develop more expertise in the game before final ranking. We really didn't do any layering over the dynamite, and we had confusion over the tile overlay rule: can a six-sided dynamite tile cover a six-sided normal tile? Rules seem to say no. If so, 6-sided (dynamite or not) cannot be covered.
Not a fan of broken tracks - 3-sided covering 2-sided, for example.

Solid game with hex tile laying 18xx feel. Good player interaction and opportunities for screwage. A need to watch your opponant and not just plough your own furrow.

Clever point scoring mechanism. My only real critisism is the size and fiddly nature of the tiles and especially the gems which were forever toppling over and proving tricky to pick up and restack. The board needs to be 20% bigger tunnel tiles 15% to allow more space and maneouvrability.

Route building with mines to get gems to sell. Pretty interesting mechanics. Each turn is a puzzle for you to solve to optimize your resources to collect the right gems. But will you save them or sell them? And will you get enough for them if you sell. Too complicated for casual gamers, but if you like route building and resource management, this one has some interesting new twists. I'd try it before you buy it.

From my couple plays, this is vintage Kramer and Kiesling, with an action point type system, and lots of freedom to build how you want to build. Per usual, lots of min-maxing and AP possible. There are some rules ambiguities, but there is a great faq here on bgg to clear those up. But, even considering all that, this is a neat, new system, and with some interesting ideas thrown in. I love K+K, and really like this game, as usual, played with fast-ish players.

Oh, how I wanted to like this game!  The artwork is GORGEOUS, and the idea sounds great.  The basic mechanics of the game are fine - take 1-4 actions (out of 12) on your turn, and keep going around until everybody's finished.  The problem is the down time.  Even with four usually quick (albeit tired) players, it took forever to figure out how many things to do on your turn, which things to do, and in which order to do them.  Part of the problem is that other players can build over the track pieces or even remove pieces (i.e. exhausted caches), so it's virtually impossible to plan your turn ahead of time, because the player in front of you can completely change the board.

This one is painful. It was worse on replay. Terrible AP prone tile laying mess. Not strategic. Somewhere between tactical and chaotic. WAY TOO LONG for what it offers. Much too crowded for 4 players. Just plain o' not fun. Will never play this again.

I like Cavum a lot.  I'm a sucker for network building and this had such pretty components and very little buzz, except that it was Kramer and Kiesling - good enough for me.  Many complain that with two, there isn't enough blocking or screwery.  Well, I can see that, but let me say, this is a brain-burn, even with two.  Even with a fixed, known number of tiles getting placed, no two games are the same, and trying to economize your actions to get just one more gem or prevent your opponent from getting to that empty city, etc. leads to plenty of hard thinking.  In fact, I'd say with more this could easily become too chaotic, heads exploding all around if you tried to plan out to far in advance.  Probably the place it loses the most with two is in the auction/economy of the game, as the choosing of order cards and the gem sale aren't nearly as exciting or dynamic as they should be.  That said, there is a lot to admire in this design - I really like the player boards and having your actions determined by the tokens on your board and limited by the amount of extra tokens in the supply.  Great game, huge box, but nice art.  Recommended.

RATING: 7.5
There's a lot to think about, with definite paralells with 18XX, and each turn reveals a subtlety you missed the turn before - all good signs.  First game a bit slow but it sped up as we went along and will be faster next time.  Almost an old-fashioned feel to it, but not in a bad way.  More please.  

Edit: A look at the gallery here confirms that it's probably the graphic design that's behind the old-fashioned feel (it's more of an old-fashioned 'look') - a very subdued board with positively antique graphics for the cities -  and it also re-inforces the 18xx associations - in particular by using yellow for the track (whoops 'tunnel') tiles.

RATING: 7
A really neat route building game!  I really like how everyone has the exact same 12 actions available to them each round, but are allowed to use them at their own pace.  Sometimes it is advantageous to blow through your actions as quickly as possible to quickly mine before your route gets boned, and other times patiently saving your actions will yield a high reward.  It all depends on the game situation.  I also really enjoyed the dynamite, which while sometimes chaotic, added some unexpectedness to the game.  My main complaint has nothing to do with the game, but the rule set, which leaves a lot to be desired.  However, everything played smoothly once we were able to clarify some ambiguities.  Overall, a pretty fresh offering from the double K duo if you like route building type games and don't mind a few finicky rules.

NOTE:  My complaint about the rules refers to the English rules of the original QWG version.  The FRED version has been significantly revised and is much much clearer.

Updated 7/12/10.

[thing=37734]Cavum[/thing] is simply infatuating.  In just one month has shot right to the top my all-time favorites.  Right out of the box, it contains some of the most beautiful components in my collection (and attractive box art to boot).  Indeed, the aesthetic inspiration extended even to the punchboards, which are too beautiful to throw away (and now rest safely under the box insert).  But it is the gameplay that won my heart. A route-building game tinged with a few auctions, some controlled destruction, and a lot of brain-burn, Cavum is a unique beast, and is probably the fastest game to have ever won my heart.  

I don't want to simply regurgitate my review (find it [thread=538033]HERE[/thread]), but I feel like I should hit a few highlights.  Although the game employs several familiar mechanics, it does so in often unexpected ways, and the result can be either intriguing or infuriating, depending on how you approach them.  The communal board provides an unexpectedly collaborative game experience, but one with plenty of opportunities for sudden backstabbing.  Nearly every item on the game board can be implemented to further very different strategies, and, indeed, the variability allows a game with an unusually level playing field (it's not a game about creating engines, that's for sure) to still offer success through specialization.  Above all, the game is about creativity, which is why it deserves to be a 10.  Not a game goes by where I'm not impressed with an opponent's new tactic that I had previously not considered.  It's refreshing to have a game that serves as a vehicle for the kind of experience I want to create, rather than one that stands as a puzzle that I have to deconstruct.  Cavum is that game.

Quite a bit of AP in this one. I like the game and the mechanics, there is certainly good strategy in its abstract nature. Overall, following a route on a turn is time consuming and creates more downtime than I would prefer. The game is good, just need to be in the mood to play.

Kramer & Kiesling are back!  

The gem card and gem markets seem unnecessary and bolted on merely as a way of providing a scoring method.  The route building, action point management, and turn order temp aspects of the game are brilliant however.  Quite wonderful.

Seems to be a 3 player game with strong possibilities of working well with 2 players.  I doubt 4 is near as good.

Update: Surprisingly I prefer 4 players to 3 players.  4 players allows two players to race for first and two to race for second, thus maintaining proper tension.

My original comment is below, but that first impression has proven to be not really accurate. Cavum is a game not really like any other. Gets awfully chaotic with 4 but not in an unpleasant way. Great mix of short- and long-term tactics, cool and unusual timing, and great screwage.

The photos here don't do the game justice. This is a fabulous production, with wonderful detail work on many of the components. At first, I thought the colored gems printed on the board were a mistake, but I came around to them eventually. This game's art and visual design are absolutely top-tier.

-----

Cool train game with a slightly disappointing set collection component used to essentially value players' networks. A lot of subtleties in the board play. Maybe one too many ways to score points, maybe a bit too much busywork at either end of each turn, maybe a bit too easy to find yourself in a situation where the rules require you to act against your interests. Still, these are all 'maybes,' and this skewed vision of 18xx as seen through an action point system has a lot to offer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are some interesting ideas here.  I love forced cooperation here, and the communal tunnels would seem to offer this.  I love the ability to spoil other player's plans, and the placement of stations seems like it could accomplish this.  I love the idea of early investors in the market reaping the greater benefits to add an element of bluff and timing to the economics.

I don't know why, then, this game failed to deliver for me.  I think part of it has to do with almost all of my plays being two player affairs.  The tunnels were never as cramped as it seemed they should be.  Players seemed to have plenty of building options to prevent them from being totally shut out of an area.  While this was satisfying in that it kept the final scoring close, it also felt like it sucked all of the angst out of the decision making process during the game.

The market mechanic was also very spiffy.  I really love being able to control the tempo in the game, but again, in my 2 player games, the market never felt as alive as the it seemed like it should.  perhaps the differential for selling first versus second was not sufficiently great in the two player game to create too much of an incentive to divest in gems early.

In the end, I believe that I like the more forced cooperation and shared incentive structure of Greentown better than Cavum.  Although Greentown is missing the dynamic market place of Cavum, the requirements around touring create, for me at least, a much more interesting decision space.  I wish I had the opportunity to try Cavum with 3+ to see if some of my critiques are prevalent mostly at the low player counts, but since those opportunities would be rare, I decided to trade the game away.

Tremendous route building game, spun around an very interesting action selection mechanism that constraints. A second layer of complexity offers turn manipulation and a solid economic subsystem. Lots of screwage here, so if you don't like conflict, you're out of luck. 

A great K&K game, and an underrated gem. The original rulebook was vague and did not help the game, but the FAQ and updated rulebook sorted things out. If you like 18xx and Tikal, try this one out while you can find it for cheap. 

Malus points for the rulebook and the huge box.

Wow, really good. I didn't want to get my hopes up too high (big Kramer & Kiesling fan), but it really delivers. Everyone calls is a brain burner, and I guess it is, but it doesn't fell that bad to me. I had heard about the dynamite making things very chaotic, but that's not too bad either. Specifically because the dynamite doesn't explode until [i]after[/i] everyone has done their "pick up" of gems for the round. There's a really nice balance between the taking gems part, and building across the mountain to the new cities, and being a source of residual income.

RATING: 6
The first time I played Cavum I was at QWG HQ for a large prototype day. I had more or less finalised the rules, and was sort-of eager to give the game a go. I was a little worried that the game would result in a chaotic mess, which is not at all my favourite 'mechanism'. Fortunately, the game was a lot less chaotic than I feared, although a thorough post-mortem analysis revealed several weaknesses in our strategy. I attempted to fix these in later games, and came to the conclusion that my ideas were only partially correct: having lots of assignments can actually be a hindrance rather than an asset since all of your efforts must then be focussed on getting lots of gems. That leaves you vulnerable to subtle city-strategies. Case in point is one game in which I finished twice as many assignments as my girlfriend, but she ended just two points away from me: she had been hiding in cities where I hadn't, and the result was that she could very easily keep up. Gem auctions are merely icing on the cake and not really worth it unless you're sure you have lots of rare gems which others do not. I've not seen this happen in the games I've played to date.

Cavum in itself is a game with strong subject matter, but the actual gameplay is a bit... well, boring. You are continually evaluating a path through the mountain, and this is simply not something I find interesting, although it does engage the brain in a nice way. What I truly  don't like very much is the shape of the game itself. The gems are too small, and easily fumbled when delving them; and the dynamiting causes shifts in the fragile tile network. It is not a very usable game, and that leaves me a little less enthusiastic to this title than I otherwise should be. The lineage to the mask games is apparent; the game also requires the same 'schwung' to play as is the case with Tikal and Java lest people slip in to AP-mode. It will also draw the same kind of negative comment, too. 

[b]Update[/b]   Now that I have a decent number (> 5) of games under my belt, I'm beginning to think that Cavum will not ever be a major hit with me. There are several reasons for this. One is the already mentioned poor usability which is murder on people with big hands. The second is the game's lack in what I think of as 'transparency'. For example: you are required to auction off the right to select a play order card, but it is very difficult to establish their inherent worth in addition to creating nasty situations where one player makes a sacrifice to prevent another from obtaining a lead on delving—which happens only 12 actions later! At the same time the loss of a vein tile is [i]very[/i] important to everyone, so there is definitely incentive for the players to vie for the ability to continue profiting. Another example: the gem auctions. The reverse order-mechanism is a nice gimmick, but in most cases it is impossible to say whether or not participating in an auction is good or bad. All in all the game features mechanisms which do not give the feeling of giving some control to the player; instead they merely obfuscate matters for the sake of obfuscation and a sort of laziness on the part of the author who couldn't be bothered to figure out something more straightforward. Hence a lack of 'transparency'.

Since the board can change considerably during a round, there will be quite a lot of moments when you suddenly know you are not going to achieve your goals, and are equally suddenly cast in a position of extensive damage control rather than vying for some hard-to-get-at gem vein or getting into a worthwhile city. It remains hard to get a good feel for this aspect: it has to remain intuitive, and can result in better or worse performance with almost annoying capriciousness.

The '6' is rather suitable for this game, I think.

The route-building/blocking/destroying in this game is [i]excellent[/i]. There's enough connectivity to be interesting, and enough [b]un[/b]connectivity to be interesting. The action system is also really nice; not only does it provide engaging constraints, but player control over tempo in a way that's uncommon.

I'm less fond of the "turn gems into points" part of the game - it's serviceable enough, and serves to drive the main action, but I wish it were as awesome as the game's main arena.

I like it.  I've played three times, and it strikes a good balance between too heavy and too light, while still maintaining a 'heavy' feel to it, via the abstract board play.  I'm good at the game, which I s'pose doesn't hurt...

Rated after 1 play @ 3 players.

Interesting game where players are building a network of tunnels to mine gems. Dynamite tiles let you destroy existing parts of the tunnel and rebuild. The board seems almost too large at 3 players, higher player counts required for a tight map. Using dynamite also is costly use of your actions.

[15 Dec 2017] - 7 (2 plays)
The second time playing this game went much better. After working through the learning on a number of 18xx games and playing some games with more complex action selection, how to play well seemed easier. The rulebook is still horribly written. It took me 30-45 minutes of reviewing the rules as well as a BGG document to get most of the rules down for how to setup the game and play. That investment in effort to learn to play and play correctly is probably what keeps this rated low. Total time for 2 players was on the order of 90 minutes.

This'll burn your brain. Too many paths, aaaaagh!!

A unique and good game, though... but I'll need several more plays to begin to be competent.

Update: After a couple more plays, this game continues to impress. Plays just fine with two, but is even better with more.

Update 2: After even more plays, I'm really enjoying the route building aspects of this one. I'm not a huge fan of the route building mechanic, but this one really nails it!

Bought at Essen 2008.

Cavum is an interesting tile laying, route planning set collection game. 

The route planning aspect is where the game shines, and has some resemblance with the 18xx routing scheme.

Rules are tricky to get around, and it's really easy to spoil the game playing it wrong.

There are lots of interesting decision to make, and this could undoubtedly lead to Analysis Paralysis with the wrong audience.

Very interesting route building mechanic what with limited tiles of the various types, the timing issues the varied player lengths provide, and the dynamite. But the scoring mechanism which values the various gems: not interesting and detracts from the game.

RATING: 8
Some players rushing forward -- digging through to virgin territory in the hopes of blocking off a portion of the mountain while leaving their initial tunnels vulnerable -- while others progressing at a slower pace, defending with mountain Stations at every step, gives this game a great tempo. Reaching the far cities early can give big points, but aiming to link up initial infrastructure through open spaces (especially those resulting from dynamite) can be an efficient use of actions. Rated 8.0 after the first play. (August 2016)

The game is really a brain burner.  Where do I place the tiles?  How can I get 1 more gem and not leave my position vulnerable (lots of screwage in this game)?  Should I use 1 action and save the rest, or use all 4 this turn?  Lots of tough questions to answer.  AP can really set in; so probably best to limit it to just 3 players.  I can't rate it higher after my first play because it felt kind of artificial.  A ton of stuff to do just to collect a few gems.  We probably built inefficiently in our first game because it felt like the game ended right when things started getting interesting.  Unfortunately, it took us several hours to get there.  In the end we all finished pretty close. Normally that's a good thing, but I think in this case it's bad.  I'd like to play again to see if my opinion changes.

Stumbled through one 2p game and got many things wrong. This is not a 2p game. My initial reaction is/was unfavorable but upon reading rules for myself it seems like it could be a decent game. I just don't see this ever being a fun game. It's a very dry, thinky game.

Unlike other network games I enjoy, the board on this one is very claustrophobic and crowded and dynamic (chaotic?). It's not easy to perceive the networks and possibilities at a glance. With my aging vision this is a considerable hurdle.

This was played at BayCon 2011.

Awesome game, but it suffers a bit from a chase the leader syndrome. You have to bid victory points to catch up which costs you victory points so you fall further behind! 

Dynamite is very powerful and can ruin a whole turn for somebody when you take the last gem from the vein removing it and the dynamite underneath goes boom.

Also doesn't work it you have one *!-@* (you know who you are) who thinks the whole point of the game is to never spend victory points, or sell gems, or do anything!

After playing Cavum for the first time, I am now filled with a renewed determination to get rid of a lot of games.  The game isn't bad, but in combination with the average appearance, the shortcuts on the components and the over-roomy box (and no, I won't accept the "standard sized box" excuse this time as last year QWG boxes were all bookcase-sized) I'm really starting to dislike it and regret its purchase.

Alright, we basically have a networking game of sorts, where players can build over existing networks and cause grief for their opponents.  Not bad in that respect, except you also have to optimise your own route in the bargain.  Sounds challenging, and it is; however this is done in combination with set actions that must be taken over the course of the round.  Figuring out the best way to do this takes up most of a player's non-turn time, then changes to the network structure by the preceding player just send them back to square one.

Cavum is a game you ought to keep the AP-prone away from; that in itself is not necessarily a bad thing for me personally; it's just another negatve factor to add to the rest.

The big negative - I've got similar games which do this sort of thing better, so while there are better games to play why would I bother to play this?

RATING: N/A
Yet to play but I do have a comment on the production quality (Huch & Friends / QWG version):

Made in China :(
Sorry, but I've yet to own a board game made in China that comes anywhere close to the quality of a German built game.  Perhaps I've been spoilt over the years?  

As for the game quality is has that typical 'linen' effect with slightly washed out printing.  The tiles are quite 'sticky' and sharp edged.  How come US/German manufacturers manage to make the tiles with rounded edges that don't dig into your hands when you pick them up?

In future I'll check where a game is made BEFORE I buy it.  Publishers take note !

Trade: I may consider trading even though this is unplayed as I've not managed to get this one to the table.

Cavum is a bit of a mixed bag. The main route building game is quite intense and confrontational, building connections, cutting off others by building stations in strategic positions or simply blowing up unloved tunnels. Maybe even more than the Mask trilogy games the game space is wide open, possibly inviting excessive AP and long downtimes with the wrong players.

The scoring mechanism is a bit clunky, however. The order cards and the gem markets are somewhat at odds with each other, and I'm wondering if the game wouldn't be better off with only one of these two.

After the first plays, Cavum is fascinating enough that I'm willing to overlook a few rough edges, though. Its time-to-depth ratio doesn't look too promising, however.

RATING: 5
This game wasn't for me.

Despite of the theme (which I liked) the game has some shortcomings in its gameplay.

At first there is the auction for who is first in line, who is second etc. I have seen this feature in multiple games before Cavum and I still do not like it. 

Secondly your dependant on the choises in assignment-cards during the game (pure luck).

But my biggest 'problem' with Cavum is that I can't oversee the consequences of the choises I make during the game. It could just be me, but most of the times my actions don't have the impact on the game that I desired.
It seems a little 'at random' to me.

I have tried the game about 20 times. So I dare say I have given it a fair chance, but I still don't like it very much.....

Combine together tile placement, limited action points system (with 1-4 actions (of 12) per turn players end up the round at different moments, giving difficult tactical decisions), variable turn order (with different benefits for each player), "inverse" bidding system and an exciting end game count, and you get this excellent game. Played the prototype a lot, and highly liked it.

Cavum retracts from being a great game for two main reasons.  A) It is too prone to AP- the game is fairly opaque, and with a wealth of options on a turn, mixed in with the chaos of an ever changing board, then tossed around by the timing mechanism ( selecting the number of actions to take in order to preserve position or attempt to alter it) is all too much (and more exhausting than saying this sentence without pause for a breath).  B) The energy one spends during their downtime between turns figuring out moves is pointless (as the board shifts too much), so all necessary thinking must be done when one's turn comes around - i.e., it takes too long, and really is too much work for what the game offers.  Cavum has interesting ideas and is not a poorly designed game, but it lends itself to players that can fly by night but doesn't really reward such play.  I want to like this, but I can't make the jump.  Am I willing to play again, yes. Will I enjoy it, depends.  This is really a fence sitter, but ultimately I feel the chaos might be too high for the thought required - I love "take that" elements in games but not when this much thought is involved.

I find this game to be very interesting.  After 3 practice run thru games and one three player game I know the sequence of the actions is very important. There is a bit of chaos in the game.

Kramer & Kiesling. With Maharaja and Kramer & Ulrich's El Grande, Cavum completes my set of favorite, old school Euro games. I'm so glad I got this and I hope to get many more plays.

PROS
-Looks a bit muted from far away but up close the game is gorgeous. Little miners in little tunnels (*squeal*)!
-For a game that is saddled with the description of recipe fulfillment, this is an important part of the game but, for my money, the city scoring and color sale were much more interesting. 
-The beating heart of this game is the route building and the possibilities that emerge can be thrilling or a blow that knocks the wind out of you. It's the sort of a game where you learn from the cleverness of your opponents and they learn from you. Because of this, every game is going to be wildly different. 

CONS
-While most of the rules are what you'd expect from a typical Euro, there are a lot of little rules regarding how and where tiles can be placed that can make a steep learning curve for newcomers.
-Tiles and gems could be a bit bigger. It's easy to mess up the board state, especially when laying tiles and performing dynamite phase.
-This could change after some more experienced play but the dynamite felt fairly inconsequential, with the exception of the final city scoring.
-Order cards seem poorly balanced. A 24 VP card has a -5 VP penalty but a 27 VP card only has a -2 VP penalty? Also, the penalties could be higher to make taking an order card a more weighty decision.

Wonderful components and art, this game has been clearly well conceived. 

This game doesn't deserve the 6.5 I'm giving it. But as for my fun factor I cannot give it more. I feel it is too dry, too tight for me with this setting. 

I know I ought to give this game a second chance as I played only once, but I won't waste an other evening just to do so. 

If you like heavy, german euros, but with some confrontational element - cutthroat - and totally unforgiving, this game is for you.

To represent the action points by a number of tiles and tokens that you place on the board is a very good idea.

After one play, I'm not sure I like this game.  I tend to take a long time to analyze possible actions, and there are so many new mechanics that I'm not sure of the ramifications of my actions, hence Analysis Paralysis for me, and the game drags on too long.  In a 4-player game, there is severe competition for stations, and you can be locked out of certain areas of the board all too easily by the middle of the 1st round!  Maybe it's better as a 2-player or 3-player.

The theme is okay. Components & artwork are good.
You get constantly in your opponents way, if you don't like that, stay away from it.

A heavy tile laying game, so typical of the output from these designers. The idea is to build tunnels and 'veins' in a hexagonal mountain, with stations blocking as they do in 18xx. The little subsystems don't gel quite as well as they normally do in a Kiesling-Kramer game with city scoring and dynamite a jarring distraction from the route building action. I enjoyed my one playing of this, possibly because of its similarities to 18xx, but I do worry that the chaos/screwage factor might be a bit high for the amount of thinking and planning that the game demands.

There is a lot of screwage in this game.  It's a path-building, recipe fulfillment game, but it's tricky to get the right gems because the dynamite means you have to start again each round. The action-budgeting aspect of the game is interesting.  Three rounds felt like a little too much. (1 play)

Finally another Gamers game from the duo?  Well for starters there is zero luck in the game, always a plus in a gamey title. I see it being compared to train games, I never got this feeling at all but the comparisons are apt for the most part and after more play it certaintly does resemble one, like a cross between a train game and Java. 

Players are miners trying to build up tunnels in the mountains and cash in on veins to fulfill contracts. The theme comes through quite well for a Euro game and the game is mostly unique, no close comparison can be made but it is definitely related to Torres and the Mask series. 

The game is 3 rounds with scoring at the end of each round. At the beginning of each round turn order is auctioned off and paid for with points. Each position also comes with a dynamite tile to be used during the round, I thought this was balanced with going first receiving the least powerful tile and last the most powerful however after our third game it seemed going last had a definite advantage in rounds 1 & 2 for board position and in round 3 going first might be best. However, going first will get you at least one more contract than at least one other player, this is why I think it has the weakest dynamite now but even after 3 games I'm still not sure about the turn order balance yet, either way it is auctioned off so you have choices here. Also, the contracts are great but there are also reverse auctions to get points too but these are not as reliable as having a contract as you have to compete to sell and you might not get to, at least until the end of the game and here prices can be lower. 

The more you play, the more the subtleties appear in this one and the way things work seems to make more sense. At first it looked so simple, too simple, but then we were missing rules, there is a little more depth here than you will see in your first playing. The rules are quite simple on paper and there are not many of them, an elegant game for the most part for the depth involved and without rule exceptions. However, in practice, [b]the rules are quite TRICKY to get right when playing [/b]and maybe even a little unintuitive (or just different than what were used to in a game like this) and [b]one or two rules off does change how the game plays[/b] so becareful here (a few things are a little ambiguous also but answered in the forum). 

Every player gets exactly the same tiles to start a round (except the one won in the auction) and every player HAS to play them all for the round to end. Next in turn order, contracts are selected, these are the main ways to get points, any not taken get 2 points added for the next round which are cumlative. These are filled by collecting the gems required. To get gems you build mountains into the tunnels and discover veins, you will need to build stations in order to mine the gems. Gems are used for contracts but also can be sold off in an auction at round end for points if the price is good, only one of each kind can be sold so this is, and should be, fought over but the price gets lower with each sucessive bid (reverse auction). Unfulfilled contracts will give you a small penalty at game end, there is a final selling of gems starting with who is losing which is a catch up mechanism (you could plan for this actually) and then the most points wins. 

Essentially thats the game but there are some twists, as can be expected considering the creator. Tilebuilding can also be done upwards, each tile has a number of tunnel exits on it, 2 being the lowest and 6 the highest, to build on top the number of exits must be higher thus the 6 can never be built on. Dynamite, this actually sounds much nastier than it is. Just like it sounds it will blow stuff up, whats under it and whats around it. The big thing here is, scoring and prospecting always happans first, so the screwage effect is there but it is minimal and not as bad as it sounds, especially in the last round so complaints of chaos here might be from people playing with the wrong rules. With the correct rules, which again are clear mostly but just tricky, screwage can be difficult thus limited chaos, you have to remember that tiles can also be built on top of dynamite nulling their effect and stations for blocking can only be built on a tile YOU JUST placed and can not be built on level 2 or up, these are CRITICAL rules that are very easily missed believe it or not. 

A pretty elegant and strategic game. Components are very nice as is the art from Mike D, the box is way too big however, another one like Dominion where the price gets jacked up with the unnecessary box size. (although price here is much better than for Dominion) It seems to me more than 15 contracts should of been included possibly, 5 come up every round so there are just enough, this means you know which ones are coming and they wont change game to game, this might actually be better for a strategic game but could hurt replay a little not sure yet but I don't think so. 

We played this with 2, 3 and 4 players. 2 fell pretty flat and it was weird that some things weren't scaled down, it felt like the weight of Torres with only 2. 3 was great and I think maybe the perfect number, shorter and a little more control (caveat - I prefer 3 in many games) than a 4 player, now bordering on Java weight with 3. Our 4 player was cut short and we had some rules wrong but I think it will play pretty good overall, a little longer (2 hours roughly depends on players) , a little more AP possible and a little chaos possible however. 

Great game after 3 plays so far

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Yikes 4 player was WAY too long, best with 3 and the only number I will want to play with like Java in that sense, works great with 4 but not something I want to play due to length and downtime. STICK TO 3 PLAYER is my advise for anyone going to play, complaints and lower ratings are due to the 4 player for sure as its much more AP prone than 3. 

Something else I noticed is the final auction seems to be too much of a catch up mechanism the way it is set out making results somewhat less meaniful, I'm not sure if it can be done any better either but its fine mostly, makes scores VERY close so far in our games.

This impression is fairly preliminary, but it felt like the game was too chaotic for me. I prefer a bit more control in my games in terms of planning and this seems like the kind of game that you have to go into with more of a go with the flow mindset. It does seem like the way some of the systems work are really cool. It seems like you can do a decent job isolating some mines to limit certain gems to yourself with aggressive use of stations, and in general the route building seems interesting. But overall the game wasn't quite what I'd hope for. But hopefully I'm wrong, I'm sure I'll be giving it another chance eventually.

I friend asked me to read the rules because he didn’t understood them, after reading the English rules I can see why. They are badly written with room for confusion, the worst offender was how they explained the Scoring for the cities phase. 

Rules apart, I just found out this is a Kramer game and I keen to play it. Hopefully I will do it today :D. Just from the rules it seems the game is very tense with a lot of interesting decisions, the auction sequence is very similar to the one found on Tikal (a game I love).

I have high hopes for Cavum, a game that until today was way below my radar.

It seemed like a great medium-heavy game. The game is not bad per se, but I was expecting a little more fun from it. After my only play I felt the gameplay to be very flat and boring, still I’m willing to give it another chance in the future. 

The game components are pretty nice, and when they are deployed in the board they look gorgeous. There can be a lot of downtime (I hate downtime), so I think the game is best played with 3 players. I also really like that the game has nearly zero luck, although the screwage factor is pretty high.  I should like this BUT for some reason I don’t. I didn’t have any fun (even though I won the game) playing Cavum.

Perhaps the biggest problem for me is that the players take very long turns, as the game situation can change dramatically from each turn, you cannot really plan far ahead before your turn. Also the game rules are very bad written. 

In conclusion, I wanted to like the game. I want to play again to re-assess my opinion, but right now I don’t have any urge to play Cavum in the near future. I vastly prefer to play Tikal over this one as both games scratch the same itch for me.

This is an unusual Kramer/Kiesling design. It is a cousin of their action-point allowance games, but there are no varying action points. You have 12 actions you take during a round and on your turn you choose to take 1-4 of them. So players are taking the same twelve actions, but at different rates and in different orders. In the game you build tunnels and stations in order to place viens of gems of different colors that you can collect to fulfill contracts. At the end of a round, you trace a continuous path through tunnels and veins from one station to another and collect gems from all veins that you pass through. The edges of the board connect to "cities" and another significant source of points is being connected to your stations in the cities, but the more players connected to a city, the less points it scores. Everyone also places a stick of dynamite every turn, which clears out a number of tunnel tiles every round forcing you to re-build some of your route, but also giving the opportunity to optimize paths for your new set of contracts.

Despite having a sizable collection of route-building games, I don't have another game like this one, which is why I've held on to it for so long. There are some production issues with the game. The box is too large and the tiles too small and tightly put together on the board to easily manipulate. Rebuilding your action board with tiles every turn is a bit of a drag. Some of the mechanics feel a little off. Turn order is determined by auctioning points, but with so much flexibility in how you use actions, turn order hardly seems worth the price most times. You can also score by selling gems for points, but only one player can sell gems of a particular color and the player allowed to sell is determined by a dutch auction of diminishing returns - another odd twist.

In Cavum players develop and shape the game space in concert, building a shared system of mixed-open engines (private stations, communal tunnels) and open supply lines (veins) toward fulfilling privately held but overlapping demands (order cards). Interdependence hinges largely on route building, not unlike many a train game yet with far more spatial dynamism. While stations, and to a lesser degree veins offer some stability, it is quite common to have large swaths of your network literally blow up in your face. Really fun stuff. 

In addition there is a gem market present that can be manipulated by enterprising players who may not want to focus on fulfilling jewelry orders or perhaps have excess gems to sell. The market can prove quite lucrative if timed correctly. Some have complained that this is a bit of an afterthought but I find it adds a nice strategic layer while tying neatly into the rest of the system and theme. 

Also I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the spectacular work of Mike Doyle in realizing the theme in his lovely art.

RATING: 7
Tentative 7 rating after one play. 

If you like Kramer and Kiesling's action point games, you owe it to yourself to give Cavum a try. There's a new twist here, in that you have 36 actions over the course of the game, but may take them in groups of 1-4 at a time. In other words, you can rush through the round to achieve particular goals quickly and ahead of the other players, or you can hang back and respond to their moves.

Cavum is a game entirely about creating and disrupting pathways. When you place a tile, you are only required to preserve the continuity of the board on one end of the tile. The others may create dead ends. As a result, you have to be able to see crazy zig-zaggy paths amidst a sea of discontinuity. That alone is going to put a lot of gamers off. There are lots of options to block and reconfigure. Ultimately this is not a game that any of us (all first timers) really "got" the first time through. The presentation alone merits a 2nd play (the game is gorgeous), but I doubt Cavum will be replacing Tikal at my table any time soon.

For better or worse, Cavum is a game that I admired more than enjoyed. That said, I'd be happy to play again and explore the design. Kudos to Kramer and Kiesling for keeping alive an out-of-vogue branch of modern gaming.

In Cavum, Kramer / Kiesling reinterpret 18xx, take the action point approach from the mask trilogy and add dynamite to the mix. The result is a challenging freeform confrontational analysis paralysis hell. Our game took as long as 'A Feast for Odin' including explanation at the next table. Waiting times between turns can be more than 15 minutes for a player who used up his actions early in a round. A few elements are irritating: putting a station into a city and right before the city as a common tactic to secure city points each scoring, the order fulfillment vs. selling gems for points at game end.

It's not a bad game. There's plenty of potential for clever moves. Planning ahead is essential. No two games will play out the same. But for me, the payout doesn't justify the invest. Too much downtime, not enough fun and very close results between most players in the end that could have turned on a single decision.

An interesting pick-up and deliver game set in a mountain. The game is not as difficult as it makes itself out to be, once you get the basics down, its quite simple. Players try to dig tunnels in the most convoluted manner possible and have 2 stations at the ends. You get all the gems between your 2 stations and you use the gems to complete missions.

My only complaint was that the tunnel tiles (artwork?) got extremely cluttered, a few mistakes were made while trying to check paths from station to station. Other than that, I enjoyed the game.

I'm with Ben McJunkin (chally) on this -- Cavum is an underrated game and "infatuating," as Ben puts it, especially for people who like deep, thinky, strategy games. I find this game as satisfying as anything in my collection, and it provides tremendous opportunities for creative play. It always leaves me thinking about how to improve on my next play, which for me is an indication of a great game. This is one of the deepest, challenging, and replayable games I have encountered (for me, the clear winner here is Go, but that's in a class by itself).

In my first game with a friend who enjoys deep games, I made the first move and put down a few tiles. Then it was his turn. He played his first tile then started to play his second tile, pulled it back, and slowly breathed out "whooooaah!" as in "this is only my second play and my brain is already overloaded."

One downside of Cavum is a weaker 2p experience. The gem market, in particular, needs some rules tweaking. In most games I would overlook this, but it's a special problem with Cavum because it's difficult to get three players for this. However, I have a number of ideas for variant rules and hope to develop them further. Send geekmail if interested.

Good game once you make it through all of the rules (several of which are incorrect and/or unclear in the rulebook). Can be somewhat chaotic with dynamite explosions at the end of each round destroying (at least part) of your best laid plans, but preparation can help minimize the damage so that you have less rebuilding to do than the other players. City scoring can lead to big bonuses if they go unchecked (including the final “bonus” scoring that occurs after blow up). Need to balance both offense and defense. Turn order and action point expenditure can have a big impact when prospecting and result in the difference between winning and losing.

Neat luckless connection and set-collection strategy game with an interesting management of the action points (1 up to 4 a turn). Kramer & Kieslings take on the route building element of a train game! The downside is AP and the fact that there is not that much point of thinking during the turn of the other players (as the board can change significantly during turns). Mild screwage with the explosion tiles.

After owning a copy for several years i decided to crack it open.
For me this is the best kramer-kiesling game i have played. and now i am eager to try more of their offerings.

The gameboard doesnt have a wow factor.
The player aid is functional but leaves some small things out that can make a difference.
This is however minor.
So what's great
The action point selection mechanism has a new twist here. In that you have 12 actions in a phase but you can chose to do 1-4 actions in your turn.  at the end of the phase you will have done all of your 12 actions.
Because you are building routes you are  working together. you can protect a tile by placing a station on it.  and you need those stations to drive true.  This will happen only three times in the game.  but the gems you can pick up during that "prospection" are going to be key. basicly you start at one station of your own and you have to finish at a a station of your own. 
You want those gems to fulfiill orders
There is another scoring mechanism. cities that score points if they are connected to a station .  a gem market that works really great 

And there is dynamite...
tileplacing rules and dynamate are pretty clear as well.

So far i have played it with three and i have no desire to play it with 4.

Our first game took three hours.. but it fellt like we were only playing for 2 hours.
So that is a great sign.
We wont be able to complete this in 60 minutes though.

So i am going to say this is my best new to me game in 2018.
I have a copy of Rising sun on its way. and Lisboa was another new game to me this year. Mind you it is only february.

Production wise it wont be able to compete with those deluxe games. Once again there is nothing wrong with the production of cavum. The gem tokens are a  bit fiddly but thats it. 
I have high hopes for rising sun gameplay as well. and lisboa 's gameplay was solid as well.

However there is something that i love about routebuilding which is odd because i don't like puzzles. 

Anyway thats enough rambling from me. 
I think this is a real gem. And i am surprised you find this so low in the rankings.
Btw explanation is quick too.  and game length is something that will differ from froup to group.
Just don't play it the first time with four. each player has 36 actions.  so it adds a decent amount of time to the length ( also the game didnt speed up as there were more options available because more routes were build and some routes were interrupted because of explosions. ) and you are counting on some players to finish a route for you.

Great, great game

Cavum tries to hit to the sweetspot, but miss it: first it looks that there isn't any problems, but the biggest issue is that there are just too much choices. Which means that you find yourself in a situations like this: when somebody do this, it fucks my gameplay and I've to fix it with this move... then the third guy comes and do this and that... So maybe I'll have to do this and now happens that... This kind of AP problems is obvious. Only way to fix that is not to worry those moves at all and play just fast. But then you don't get all the greatness, what Cavum offers. So... I don't find exact time and place where I would choose this game instead of mone better ones AND that's the issue here.

con: confusing and sometimes counter-intuitive rules, lots of rule details make it maybe the least elegant Kramer-Kiesling game I know. Because of this, it's also hard to teach or re-learn after a while.

pro: you have a wide array of available actions and strategies AND the game also seems to be rather deep. It has some fun mechanisms (especially the travelling salesman route-building which is the core of it, maybe the rules could have been trimmed down a bit so it would get more focus?). It brings some Java and Tikal memories back and I really like those too. 

All in all, it's a strong design; maybe had it been a bit more elegant, it could have become a real classic. Now it's just very good with some minor problems.

Very good game that engages both the right and left hemispheres of the brain.  Elegant mechanics, easy to teach rules, and a tight map where every move and every action counts.  Nice presentation -- even though the components are just cardboard they are good quality and with a consistent look.  It is definitely a heavier, strategic game, with almost no luck involved.  After only two plays I feel comfortable with the mechanics and feel like I barely scratched the surface of the strategic possibilities of the game.  Plays great in 4, although perhaps it could be a little shorter.  If played competitively could be a long game due to the depth of thinking /planning that can go into planning each move.

This is an excellent route building game, with a neat little market to boot. You're building tunnels deep into the mountain to mine veins of gems. You then use the gems you acquire to make items worth VPs. You can also sell the gems themselves for victory points. Oh, and you can blow up tunnels with dynamite markers. What makes this game even more interesting is each player has the exact amount and type of actions to take each round, so games are won by he who maximizes his moves. One of the best in my collection.

Interesting mechanics. After reading through the rules I figured I knew what was going on but when I attempted a solo play I realized there were a lot of corner cases that were left ambiguous.  Read the Rules Forum posts here on BGG for clarification.

Our games have been a bit more cut throat than I was expecting the game to be.  Blocking tunnels with station placement and ruining pathways with dynamite can be particularly back stabbing.

I've enjoyed playing but it can be a bit thinky and AP prone. Not a lot you can do when it's not your turn.

K&K have done it again and this time they bring some new slants to previous design ideas.  The game has just the right amount of tension, plenty to think about and a dynamite mechanic that keeps the board play from being static without being too chaotic.

Cavum has an 18XX vibe with it's route-building and ability to button spots.

There's an interesting action selection / action point mechanic where each player has a menu of 12 actions to play in a round.  On your turn you can play 1-4 of your remaining actions.  This makes for some interesting decisions since timing is crucial; sometimes you'll want to compose a key early play (usually to sweep up gems or gain board position before it's blocked out) and sometimes your aim will be for a late play on the board.

There are many ways to score including route building to cities, set-collection and stock-market manipulation.  Overall a fine game.

"A lesser known K&K game, Cavum has players building tunnels in a mountain, prospecting for gems, fulling orders for sets of gems, or selling gems at a downward-auctioned price ... super crunchy at the 4P count ... We thought a 2P game would result in players building their own separate areas of the board, but due to the paucity of gems, players are funneled into the same mining areas."

The mechanisms here are really interesting, and forcing players to take 12 actions per round while giving some flexibility with what and when they are is almost fascinating.

More specifically, I don't feel that much like re-learning it, teaching it to others, and repeating that process enough times to find a group who can really get into it. You could pretty much say this about a lot of eurogames I've played and owned. This one is still on my shelf, though.

Cavum is an intricate, fascinating game, but more prone to analysis paralysis than any game I've ever played. A pair of "instinctive" players can hammer this one out in 45 minutes, but my most recent play with 4 took [i]3.5 hours[/i]. I'd rather go all in for Dominant Species or Struggle of Empires if I knew I'd be playing for that long.

As others have stated, the rules seem straightforward but can be quite tricky. Several plays in, I was still getting stuff wrong. Indeed, a couple overlooked, unanticipated rules allowed me to blunder my way to a second place finish in our most recent game. How much longer will it take next time, now that everyone is aware of these additional intricacies? I'm scared to find out, but the game remains intriguing enough for me to want to play again.

Chally's review at https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/538033/what-youre-missing-cavum convinced me: The combination of auctions, area control, route building, and pick and deliver - all spiced with dynamite that changes the board, was just an offer too good to refuse. Yet, the gameplay didn't sweep me away as expected. It's a bit fiddly and the flow is interrupted by a bit too many mechanisms. Still a good game which requires some plays to understand all strategic and tactical layers of.

A solid design from Kramer & Kiesling, one of the most productive design duos(I think). The game allows you lots of freedom to do things, and I'm sure the game has significant depth in terms of tactics. It shares the spatial-puzzle element of Torres and Java, and I really like this element. Overall, it's a bit behind Kramer's indisputable masterpieces such as El Grande or Torres in terms of elegance in design (for example, the order card mechanism does not feel quite natural to me, due to the uneven number of orders each player will get), but nonetheless a very good design and a new release I thoroughly enjoyed in a long time.

Only 36 actions per player per (semi-fiddly) game, yet it still takes 2 hours for 3 players. There's a lot of thought required, thinking in terms of what you can do but also what whoever goes after you can do, and guarding accordingly. Fun factor was not high in a first play. It's one of those games I'd be embarrassed to bring to a group of newbies, like squandering what gaming hours remain. Components are impressive.

Opportunistic brain burner - lots of AP. The landscape changes quite rapidly, it is almost impossible to plan one's turn. Not a good combination with the AP. Played a 4 hour game with 4 players, and I will never play this game with 4 again, there was no control at all, and too much downtime. I would try it with 3, since the route building aspect is intriguing, hoping that there would be a little more planning and defending a position would be possible.

RATING: 7
The basic goals of set collection and TtR Märklin style passenger movement are unoriginal. The actual beef lies within the turn order system. You have to juggle between completing your most important short-term goal and waiting for other players to deplete their actions. Waiting usually brings the benefits of not helping the others too much, and avoiding excessive screwage.

Definitely not for slow or AP prone players. Screwage levels might also get high occasionally.

規則:
*先放置對應的隧道板塊在圖板上，在六個出口的板塊上放置一個礦，上面放9個黃寶石，剩下的寶石放在寶石列，同列放同色擺滿，圖板購買區放置5礦，4個6出口，3個4出口，2個3出口跟每個玩家顏色的兩個方塊，順位卡照數字放在圖板上，訂單卡洗勻疊起抽五張開著
*每人拿計分標記放20，1個行動版
*遊戲進行三大輪，每輪有四個階段
1.競標順位  第一輪年輕玩家起始，競標出0分，直到所有人pass贏的拿一個順位卡，在由下位繼續競標直到每人一張，每人根據順位拿12個板塊/方塊(6/4/3/2出口各一，1礦2個購買選擇1個開墾卡，3個方塊，1個炸藥版塊根據順位卡上顯示)，之後照順位拿訂單卡直到所有人都跳過，沒被選的訂單卡放兩分標記上去，下次拿的人直接先獲得上面標記分數
2.建造 每放(使用)一個版塊或方塊算一個行動，玩家照順位每次執行1~4個行動，直到所有玩家12個行動都做完此階段結束
>放隧道版塊  要相連場上且至少一個出口相連或是蓋在比自己出口小的隧道或炸藥板塊上
*要放到礦旁的話該礦必須先被連結到，礦視為有六個出口
*放到城市旁一定要有出口連到該城市，如果該城市有方塊，只有該玩家能蓋在相鄰處
*炸藥版塊放置規則相同
>放方塊 板塊上的只能放在剛放的板塊上，且只能放在第一層(有疊起的不能放)，城市的則要有連結到板塊上的城市才能放
*其他顏色的方塊會阻擋連線，但是礦不會
>放礦 可放在任何隧道或炸藥板塊上，不能跟城市或其他礦相鄰，放置時同時選一個顏色寶時放四個在上面(從左邊拿，2人玩時放三個)
*當上面寶石被拿完後，將礦版塊放到購買區

It would have been a game I fell in love with 8 years back. How does it stand now? Two things notched it down for me. The decision breadth is too wide within each turn - too many possibilities, too much unclarity on good construction vs bad construction - and it's combined with a deep decision tree (up to 4 consecutive actions each turn). All of which is fine in a 2 player abstract. In a 4 player, that spells some serious downtime. Combine that with the potential for serious pussage with track overlays breaking up your track, plus dynamite explosions, and all that serious downtime and thought is wasted, plus we have kingmaking situations. Interesting design and all, and interesting to discover good vs bad play, but too much contradiction in purpose for mine. I'd play again, but it's not got me in its thrall.

This is a very interesting game. The mechanics of playing tunnels and veins that have jewels and them using your stations to collect them when you prospect works great. You get exactly 12 predetermined actions each round (two of them give you several options) and your last one is to collect jewels. But others can steal what you need and you have to fulfill your jewelry orders. Fun and original. Worth a play for sure.

Cavum is a connection game about trying to build a network of tunnels to mine gems.  Players place tunnel tiles, gem veins, and dynamite tiles that will destroy surrounding tiles--and none of these belong to specific players.  What does belong to players is station cubes, which are placed on tiles such that a player is able to trace a path to collect multiple gems without going through the same tile.  These gems can be turned in via contract for fixed points, or sold on a market that uses a supply and demand mechanism.  I enjoyed this one, but there was a lot of players getting in each other's way, which made it a bit stressful.

It's as if 18xx and Splendor had a baby. Not sure how much I liked basically running a 'D-Train' and picking up as many gems as possible. I thought it was neat initially, but kind of wore on me as time went by. The goal cards felt extraneous. I'd be far more interested in not playing with those and doing a market selling of gems collected instead. Obviously it would require more than just simply getting rid of the goal cards, but I feel like it would be a stronger game because of it.

I liked it, but a few of the rules were wonky (stations can spring up anywhere and tile can be extended anywhere as well) and the game was a tad chaotic with 4 players. I'd play it again, but it has since dropped off my wishlist. A lot to like in this, but a lot that rubbed me the wrong way.

[b]Edit:[/b] We had a major rule wrong where stations AND ore tiles were also getting blown up from dynamite. I think I would enjoy this game more with the fix, but still not sure how much more it will rise. We just about completely wiped the board numerous times during the one play of it. It felt far more chaotic because of that.

RATING: 7
This is very interesting hexagonal tile placement/maze-mixer/pick-up & delivery/timing based-on-actions-taken strategic game. Throw in a seasoning of chaos and that about sums up Cavum. The tiles all have multiple lines (tunnels on them), you place tiles, but people don't own the tiles, but people also place stations, that only allow that player to pass through, effectively allowing only that player to take that route. People also place gem mines, but they are public and everyone can pass by taking gems, as long as they can work out a route through the gem mine that is not blocked by another player's station(s). Now throw in some dynamite and KABOOM, chaos!! There are also bonus points for connecting to buildings in towns where there are fewer other players - newer players often overlook this, until the first time it's scored and then suddenly, everyone's going to the towns. To get points, you try to fulfill contracts which indicate the number of gems you need for X money, but you can also sell single gems back, but that is via a supply/demand market based on the number of gems mined/previously sold, etc. It seems a little complicated when the game starts, but it's actually an easy game to play. It's the dynamite that messes up the best laid plans really. If fewer people use dynamite and/or don't opt for extra dynamite, it's a more strategic game, but sometimes, the whole game becomes a theory in chaos when multiple players decide blowing stuff up is fun.

Just played for the first time with my wife after owning the game for 3 years. I love the visuals, right down to the stunning box. I love strategy games, and I confess that I nearly quit before we started due to the way the rules are explained in the booklet. My wife stuck it out, bless her heart. Once we started playing, it became clearer, but it also became obvious that a 2-player game limits the possibilities the creators envisioned. It's also clear there are a LOT of levels to the game and a lot more ways to screw with opponents than we initially used. I am very willing to play it again and I expect my rating will change-- which way, I'm not sure.

1 play with 2 players and I have to say it was not a favorite. I really don't think this game is meant for 2 players so there is that and I would be willing to try this game with more but for me it just wasn't there. Maybe it looks too much like a train game. :P You have to make pathways to try and collect gems. You can potentially use other players connections but they might blow up in the future so you can't count on that. it is very trick and not the kind of abstract thinking I enjoy. Not a game for me at the moment, but I would be willing to play again with more players sometime.

RATING: 8.4
Rating after one play. I really want to play this again. Despite other comments, the amount of analysis per turn was just about right. Each player must decide their actions on their turn (as advance planning can often be difficult due to others actions changing the board significantly) but with the right players who enjoy this kind of think-y game, it is great. I like the mechanic that allows you to take from 1 to 4 actions on your turn but everyone gets the same number of actions per round. The virtual absence of random elements (cards) bumps this game above Torres for me. Yes --  possibly prone to AP, but that doesn't bother me. Negatives: the initial auction of the round seems a bit inelegant and the box IS way too large.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In this game, you play three rounds, digging routes, shipping gems along your routes and fighting for area control of the cities on the five sides of the play area. Between rounds, dynamite goes off clearing areas that once were filled, helping to mix the board state up. This was a very elegant game. In particular, the way your turn goes is you get minimum 1 maximum 4 actions depending on how fast you want to move. The round ends when each player has used all twelve of their actions but collecting gems (the point of the game) has to be done last. It's a fantastic little twist that adds this whole push your luck element to the game, where too slow and people will snatch your gems out from under you, and too fast and you miss out on the gem spots other players lay down. At the start of each turn you auction your points for turn order, and at the end you auction to get the lowest bid on selling each gem type. Knowing when to sell and when to hold to complete recipes is another crucial and fascinating element of the game.

Way too AP prone. Highly dependent on first player as he makes vanes disappear ahead of everyone else.

Played and bought at Essen 2008.  Almost pure strategy (there is randomness of 5 cards being dealt out in each of the 3 game rounds).  Beautiful components.  Interesting game play that has been rewarding replay with various aha-insights.

My only complaint is the stupid huge box that's twice as big as it needs to be.  I'm sick of anti-environmental price-increasing over-sized boxes that waste my valuable shelf space and are hard to take to game club to show the game to other interested players.  Lucky for Cavum I liked it as much as I did, or I'd have not bought it because of that damn giant box.

I really, really liked it.

The actions are interesting, and timing those actions adds another layer of depth and fun. There's room for really clever play in your tile placement. There's screwage, but not too much. There's chaos, but not too much.

I don't like the selling back of gems at the end of the rounds. It feels clunky and awkward and just seems to mess with the flow of the game.

If you're prone to any sort of AP, STAY AWAY!!!! Seriously, every turn is a puzzle (like Java and Torres, by the same designers), and when you add in the craziness of parts of the board getting blowed up real good every turn...

Fun game that I'll play any time.

Yes, there is a lot of downtime, but it is a fascinating game.  Much like Java, there is a lot to do and think about, with many clever ways to manipulate your situation.  If you go into the game realizing this, it is worth the effort. 

There is so much you want to accomplish, but there is also a whole other game going on where you want to time out your actions.  Do you want to rush to get where you want to go and perhaps miss opportunities? Or, hold out to take advantage of a full board and perhaps lose position?
 
I've only played this with three, and that feels like the right number of players.  With four the downtime and chaos vs opportunity might be too much for my taste.

Overall, though, I find this to be a great route-building game with lots of interesting strategic decisions.  I like how the dynamite alters the map and don't feel it's overly disruptive to planning.

UPDATE: Played this again, and now knowing the rules, continue to appreciate its strategic depth.  The dynamite beautifully resets the board to a degree for each subsequent round.

1 play, 4er (4 hours) - 3 newbies

I enjoyed both games and would love to play this again, but with 3. That may be the ideal number to minimize down time while still having interesting player interaction. 

This is a pretty cool, deep gamer's game with route-building, pick-up-and-deliver, action points and turn order auctioning. Each turn starts with an auction for turn order (bidding with VP). Sometimes going earlier is better: first crack at gems in low supply or on multiple players' routes, and you get to claim 2 orders. Other times, last may be better: chance to place mines of your choice (after others empty useless ones), time to react to other moves, etc. Then, players get 12 actions. They are largely the same, except for one (auctioned). These are taken in chunks of 1-4 actions, decided by players as they go -- makes for some interesting choices about timing when to do what. You try to collect gems, either to sell them to the market or fulfill contracts of specific gems for a (usually) larger VP return.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board is a hex grid, with city spaces along most of the edges. The center hex is a vein of yellow gems: place all 9 in a stack there. The rest of the gems go in their individual market areas (priced 1-9 based on supply).

Each round (3 in game), add 5 contracts (showing gem combinations; score big VP if completing them; lose some VP if cannot) to the display. Then auction (using VP) turn order chips 1-4. Players then each get the same set of tiles (hexes with various numbers of track exits, prospecting tiles, veins, option tiles, etc.) plus a dynamite hex based on their turn order chip. Take turns taking contracts until everyone passes.

Then, on your turn, play 1-4 of your 12 actions. These allow you to place tracks (expanding previous tunnels; you can also cover track tiles with tiles having more exits), stations, or veins (which you supply with gems of your choice). Gems (6 types, 9 tokens each) each have their own market where they are stored and which set their max sell price. The last action is prospecting, where you create a path from one of your stations to another, passing through as many veins as possible: take one gem from each vein. 

After everyone's 12 actions are used, any exposed dynamite tracks explode and take the adjacent tracks as well (all these are placed in the Buy Pool, which can be accessed by turning in Option tiles)! You score for stations in cities based on the number of empty hexes. Then, for each gem type, players bid (Dutch auction style, bidding for the lowest price they'll accept) and may sell their gems for VP at their bid price. 

At game end (after 3 rounds), players sell off all their remaining gems (with lowest VP selling next gem), there's another city scoring, and players lose VP for incomplete orders. Most VP wins!

RATING: 4
This is really just an abstract game with an uninteresting theme, ugly components, and really stressful amounts of interaction.

The game is played where each player is a miner and tries to carve tunnels through this mountain to get to valuable gems.  This is done by players placing tiles on a hexagonal grid with different lines on them showing which way the tunnel is traveling.  If this tunnel connects one of your depots to a gem mine you MIGHT get to collect.

I emphasize MIGHT because there are so many opportunities for screwage in this game.  A player can place a tile on top of another to disrupt your route.  A player can blow up a section of tunnel removing it from the game completely.  A player can place a depot in the middle of your route to prevent you from using it.  With so many ways to be disrupted every round it wasn't tense but actually stressful trying to formulate any kind of strategy.

When trying to describe what an abstract game is I compared this game to Blokus and my friend (who brought this game) got insulted.  After playing it though...there are some similarities.  An abstract game where you try to place shapes to block your opponents, hmmm...

The game is also hideous.  It is styled with 1940's-era images with dirty gray-brown muted colors.

I'm still deciding about this one. I'm not sure if I'll rate it higher than a 6 but for now a six is good enough. I'm not a big rail system fan and this one suffers on that. It has some nice mechanisms such as the bid for selling stones but everything is too much programed to work. It seems that everybody has to play in a certain way in order to things work out fine. I don't like that in a game especially because both of the times I've played it it didn't work fine. I'm starting to think that maybe it's the game's fault and not player's.

I don't like the rythm and the backstabing. It's a good brain burner but not something I'll play very often. Excelent production though.

Still want to give it a try with two players.

Like Magna Grecia, this is a train game masquerading as something else. But it's a train game as done by Kramer and Kiesling, whose fingerprints are all over the place. The building of the infrastructure is very reminiscient of their AP-games.
This building aspect is something I very much like in their games, but it comes at the price of analysis paralysis, which I hate above all other things. Cavum adds to that that you get a speghetti dish with different tracks and stations, meaning that it's hard to keep track of which veins you can reach and which ones not.
But still, I enjoyed my one and only play. I just need to be sure I don't play this with the folks I don't want to play Java and its ilk with.

I would rather spend the 2 to 3 hours playing one of the shorter 18xx games.  I must admit though that the balance ebtween going first and going last is interesting--in the former you get the ability to run out mines, but in the latter getting that last placement is great.  Would love to see a dynamic like that in a shorter game, or one with better blocking opportunities than dynamite.

In each of the three rounds, players have 12 actions: 3x stations, 4x mineshafts, 1x mine, 1x dynamite, 2x wild "any of the above" and 1 prospect/scoring.

It's a combination of connection game and pick-up-and-deliver: players are trying to build routes between sides of the hexagon-shaped board, passing through as many mine tiles as possible in order to collect gems from them. Gems can be sold either on the open market or traded to fulfil order cards for particular sets of gems.

Building these routes is fraught with peril: placing a station in the mine blocks others from passing, exhausted mines reveal the shaft beneath, which may have fewer exits, and dynamite tiles explode and destroy surrounding shafts.

I do have some qualms. The result is very open but sweeping changes to the board can seem chaotic. I enjoy the uncertainty and forced cooperation, but hidden elements such as overbuilt dynamite tiles revealed when a vein is exhausted are tough to remember. Turn order is also very strange -- there is advantage in going last as well as going first so it's not clear how much it's worth to bid. Being first bidder is not necessarily an advantage. Placement rules are somewhat frustrating as there are similar-but-slightly-different restrictions on normal shafts, veins and stations.

It's an intriguing total package and one I would like to explore further.

Nice strategic game that really seems daunting and fiddly at first.  Once you get past the first round, the true strategy starts to appear and you see just how deep the game can get.  Not for the light at heart, and tends to lead to some strong decisions that may not be for a group that hates direct conflict.  Prefer it 2 player than 3-4.

Rating based on one play with 4 players.  I feel like this game would be considerably better with 3, but I'm not sure I'll find out.  I like the ideas, but it adds up to an incredible amount of AP, and I think it's just too much for my patience.  Our game took 3 hours, and this game does not have the depth of a 3 hour game.  If it played in 90 minutes, my rating would definitely move up in to the 'good' numbers.  

I also think the visual design is really mediocre for what could be a great looking game.  I had a really hard time reading the connections, and that made AP prone decisions to be that much harder to make.

Oooough.  On one hand, there are some interesting things going on here.  And I tend to find "You only get X number of actions" games, like La Citta, interesting in a brain-burny sort of way.  But what we have here is a game that, I think, could make ANYONE into [i]that[/i] AP person, who has to rethink every turn seven times. It's quite fiddly, though after a couple rounds it becomes a bit smoother.  Overall, I just didn't get the level of enjoyment I'd expect from something that requires that much painstaking forethought.  Give me Le Havre or Caylus any day.  It's interesting and I would recommend it toward a certain sect of people who enjoy 2 hour AP fests, but I'm not willing to invest the amount of time to teach (which is rough with some difficult to communicate rules) and play this for the amount of fun it will give, generally, unless someone asked me to play it.

Cavum has a lot of interesting ideas going on in it and there is clearly scope to be rewarded for playing well. The downside is that this comes at the expense of downtime. Even with 4 playing quickly, there was too much time spent watching others staring at the board, planning their turns.

Cavum sets up a brilliant premise but the game is no fun.  Hexes on player mats are a genius way to keep up with remaining actions, but each action is rulesy in the most unexpected ways.  Paragraphs of rules are necessary to describe what should take a sentence.  Whatever seems natural, isn't; whatever you'd like to do, you can't.  The result is dry and tedious.

SOLD (September 26, 2010)

A solid Kramer & Kiesling design. Better than Australia certainly, and perhaps on par with Maharaja and Tikal, but definitely doesn't measure up to the K&K greats like Java and Torres. Cavum is actually remarkably unlike any of those prior K&K offerings because it's a route-building game, vaguely reminiscent of Age of Steam as you try to plan out routes to pick-up different color goods. The twisty, turny routes were a bit frustrating (like in Metro) and the destructive dynamite was a bit frustrating as well, but the way in which actions were allocated and turns divided provided a nice amount of flexibility as to your approach. Moreover, the scoring system seemed to reward various approaches, which is appreciated. The Doyle artwork, including his signature attention to detail, makes for a visually appealing experience, and thankfully one that doesn't prioritize form over function, as El Capitan has been accused of doing, perhaps rightfully so to some degree.

This is an amazing game but it is not for all people. It is completely open on strategy and decisions are influenced by what the other player do or do not do. There is always interest about the next move. Now the problem is that you may end up with a lot of analysis-paralysis. Read carefully the rules (and read all the rule postings here). Components are functional but I wish they had used better components. Although the game is aesthetically not very pleasing, this is a GREAT game for gamers.

RATING: 7
Cavum is a game about building paths and collecting gems. Most of the game is about trying to build paths that let you trace a path between your stations in a way that lets you pass through mines and collect a gem on that mine. Additionally, you want a path to the edge of the board to score points for the city on that edge.

There are four types of path tiles: a straight path, a Y path, an X path and an Asterisk path. There are also mines which you can decide to be any type of gem in the game (just like real life mining). Each turn you get one path tile of each type, a mine tile, three station cubes, two wild tiles, a collect gems tile and an exploding path tile (which depends on turn order). You can play between 1 and 4 actions on your turn which can be using your cubes or tiles.

Each round you bid on turn order and then draft contracts. There's X+1 contracts available where X = number of players. So the start player has first crack at taking the extra contract if they want. Although, you don't have to take a contract if you don't want. Contracts pay out variable number of points and require variable combinations of gems.

Gems you don't need for contracts can be sold at the market, which pays more for gems that more people have. Thematically that's odd, but it encourages players to underbid each other, with only each winning bidder for each gem type getting to sell any of that particular gem.

Tiles can go on top of other tiles provided that the number of path exits of the new tile is higher than the lower tile. When you place a tile, you can use another action to place a station on it (but if you don't, you can never do it later) which prevents that tile from ever being built over and acts as a roadblock to anyone else's path. Exploding tiles will go off after the round destroying all path tiles around them that don't have stations (and everything they're on top of.

All of this makes for a very thinky game where you really have to figure out how to best place things for yourself and how to best screw over other players. Things can change dramatically based on what other people do so you're constantly having to re-evaluate the board.

Didn't really care for this one.  The theme seems tacked on, even for a euro.  It's too easy to make connections to grab all or most gems every turn.

There's a good game under there, but its buried under poorly executed rules and fiddly cave tiles.

Sort of a pick-up-and-deliver game, where the delivery part has several different aspects...  and the pick-up part has explosions.

you're managing several very diverse concepts- a spatial element with the network and blocking, a market element, and an opportunity element (definitely a third of the game is timing and opportunity).  

I was initially concerned with the talk of the "auction" portion, but that's not really the core of the game, and will tend to push to an obvious and narrow range pretty quickly (which is to say, doing "badly" at the auction parts is only going to hurt you by a couple of points overall,  the real decisions in the game are the other things i mentioned above).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So many options available my brain didn't even pretend to think it could process them all, so surprisingly only medium levels of AP until the last half of the final round where it jumps to heavy-AP mode.

The tunneling mechanics are quite solid and enjoyable, with just the right amount of blocking potential while generally letting you keep things locked down safely for yourself if you spend the resources to do so.  Market mechanics are rather weak and only serve as a basic support for the other mechanics.

Rating after one 2-player play. Definitely need to try it again now that the game is a bit clearer. The objective and how to achieve that objective are not clear on first play through, and only begin to become clearer by the 2nd or 3rd phase. Fortunately, it is a very quick game, with the only time being taken up by AP as far as I can see. I also think more  players probably improves play, due to the increase in tunnels and gems on the board, but I did enjoy how elegantly this scales down to two -- eg, no kludgy rule changes except the number of gems on a vein.

Another Kramer specialty, which is to say, another Euro that I respect, but find hopelessly boring.  I've played it once, and the AP was brutal.  This game loves to take you waaaaay down the decision tree, which I usually refuse to do and instead play intuitively.  The thematic ties are also quite strange.  It's evident from the period artwork that this is supposed to be set in the American West during the gold rush, but instead of gold and silver, we're mining for... gems?  Really?  Also, it's really odd that we're all digging in the same mountain, not to mention that the "stations" which nobody can pass in the middle of the mountain is a completely out-there way of finding a theme when you need a competition mechanic.  It's a classic case of find a moderately interesting theme to come up with a basic mechanic, but then completely ignore any other ties to that theme whatsoever when building the rest of the game.  I can't condone that kind of behavior, even if the resulting game is pretty tight.  I've got enough games with innovative mechanics that fail to bring any fun to the table.  This is another I'll pass on.

Cavum is a very unique twist on the network building genre of games that brings a lot of new and interesting ideas to the table. A brain-burner, for sure, and downtime is nontrivial. Were it not for the disappointing scoring mechanism, I would rate this higher, since the rest is truly inspired. As is, I'm still interested in playing it but find that others I introduce it to usually aren't as forgiving of the game's missteps (particularly the wonky end scoring), so it languishes on the shelf. The components and art are beautiful, but why in hell is the box so big?

At first glance, this is easy to take as a drab, boring Euro. The monotone yellows and browns of the board, player aid, and tiles completely overwhelm what little color is provided by the gemstones that the players are trying to mine. The cities spaces depicted on the board look like something out of a clip art collection of old town USA, highlighted with a gross orange background. Seriously, it;s an eyesore.

Thankfully, beauty can be more than skin deep. Whatever is lacking in the presentation department, the game itself makes up for in spades. There's route planning, area majority, auctions and order fulfillment, meaning that there is literally something in here that will appeal to everyone, no matter the style of game they like. It's heavy, but also very fast...so nothing ever feels bogged down, despite the fact that it is an AP prone game. This is because of the dynamite tiles, which provide all sorts of PvP opportunities, as well as some pretty engaging puzzle solving/combo planning.

The game's most interesting mechanic is the action system. It's not Kramer and Kiesling's familiar action point system per se, but rather a riff on it. Players all have to take a set of 12 (individually different but identical as a set) actions in each round, but they can select 1, 2 or 3 of them to execute on each player turn. This means you can take single moves, to let the board develop, or fire off three in a row to seize an unexpected opportunity. It almost becomes a push-your-luck mechanic, since the longer you wait to make a move, the more likely another player is going to cash out on your favorable setup or cut off a very profitable route you were staking out.

All to say that this is a very deep, very thinky game...but one that still moves fairly quickly from turn to turn, giving it a little bit broader appeal than usual, assuming you can get your group past the drab graphics.

on the surface it seems like a game to delve into and enjoy, however this all ends up meaningless because when you delve into it you find a game that almost seems to encourage and enhance the AP properties of people.  Every little detail lets someone hedge and haw, delay and defer, retract and retrace, until all the fun is driven out in the hour-long downtime between turns.  i would only play against if there were houserules to prevent this delaying actions, for instance, if the players were required to perform 4 actions per turn, rather than 1-4... and also if an egg-timer was used to limit turns to a couple minutes.  as it was, pretty terrible experience for a game i would generally like.

I like the concept in Cavum.  It is sort of like an 18xx game except that you don't buy shares in companies and run trains for revenue, instead you build a network of mine tunnels and prospect gems to fulfill orders.  It even play just as long.  However, that is where the similarities end.  Whereas the latter is actually fun and strategic, Cavum is quite the opposite.

Not only does it suffers from a clunky ruleset.  It is also very susceptible to analysis paralysis as well as group think.  As a result, the downtime is horribly long and each turn takes forever.  Since empty veins are removed immediately and explosions can alter the board completely after each phase, long term planning is fairly impossible.  Imagine that, now even more time is needed at the start because everyone need to figure out how to reconnect their stations.

Then there are the auctions to sell back the six different gems.  An element which I found to be poorly implemented and contradictory to the idea of filling orders.

Cavum is far from elegant as some have claimed it to be.  It felt like an incomplete game and a rushed product that lacked playtesting and fine tuning.  Avoid it at all cost if you do not want to suffer through a headache-inducing experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
Bidding is involved in this game, and most of the time, I don’t like the concept of bidding. Sometimes it really works out well, but in Cavum, it doesn’t. The game isn’t transparant enought, to overlook the resulst of the deccision you make at a certain point. Mines that are almost empty, can have a huge influence on the planning someone makes.  But, the board can change so much that it’s difficult to calculate what the results of everything is. With two players it’s managable, but with more it’ll be become almost impossible to keep an overlook of what might happen.

These things will make that it isn’t a game, that we would replay again often. It’s a bit of a shame, because the artwork and the theme is fantastic.

Costed 9990 HUF (won on auction @ FLGS, discounted from 11990 HUF).
Really liked the punch-boards, such a nice detail (looked like old mining documents)

Rulebook is a bit confusing.  A real brain burner.  Almost too much of one since it seems to come at the expense of some of the fun and leads to a bit of downtime.

RATING: 6.5
Great game, with one big minus for me = downtime between turns. If downtime between turns would be smaller I would rate it with 10.

모던 아트, 타이탄, 한니발 등과 함께 마이크 도일이 아트웍을 맡은 작품. 티칼, 자바 등으로 유명한 K&K멤버의 2008년 작 카붐은 레일 놓고 광석 깨는 게임. 룰북 독파했지만, 폭발과 광석 놓는 부분이 직관적으로 와닿지 않아 한동안 보관만 했었다. 그러다가 2012년 8월 군포 당정 모임에서 Equinox님한테 배운 후, 3355에서도 한 번 돌렸다. 하지만 느낌은 천양지차라는 거...

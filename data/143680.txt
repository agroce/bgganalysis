I like the new wound mechanics and the new starters. I think this would add a lot to the games of nightfall I get to play.

Take a core concept from MTG with summoning creatures that all have trample damage that generally disappear into your discard pile on their next turn, add a very intuitive colour-based chaining system that other players can join in to and influence after the active player has finished with their plays (and subsequently the active player can continue) that also rewards additional bonuses if cards are chained with a certain colour combination and you have the most interactive and tightest deckbuilders I've had the pleasure of playing.

Personally, I love the Indian theme of this set the most, it's a lot more colourful and vibrant than other sets. Plays are counted in the first set.

Intriguing deckbuilder w/chaining mechanisms. It adds to a more dynamic gaming experience with more players.

Utter gaming magnificence in a box. Played for six hours straight today, each match got better and better. Sublime blend of theme and mechanics, easy to get into but so much depth, an easy ten from us.

Went straight from Nightfall to this. It's an improvement, but there are still a lot of mushy rules and card text.

The war for the eternal night rages around the world, and nowhere is it more bizarre than in the far east. A fully functional city in India nearly untouched by the Nightfall, uncontrolled ghouls from the seas, and strange happenings in the skies are only the beginning.

Nightfall: Eastern Skies is a strategy deck-building game in which you take control of Hunters, Lycanthropes, Vampires, and Ghouls to take down your opponent. This set features the new Link mechanism allowing for faster play.

I love the additional starting minions and the Summon mechanic. Anyway more Nightfall is always good.

RATING: 7.8
One of the best of the SPI folios. Simple fast and gets the job done. The crushing ZoC rules from the original are it's only fault. 

I use the upated Decision games ZoC movement effects and Infiltration rules from their reprint. So, playing with those rules an unofficial 8.5.

RATING: 10
Unpunched, contents in excellent nearly like new condition, box shows considerable shelf wear along edges and one corner on box top is broken and repaired (I repaired it myself), missing bridge at 2120/2121 has been very neatly drawn on map with very fine dark marker, Highway bridges over rivers are highlighted very neatly in light yellow highlighter to more easily identify them during play

BIN: Will consider sale (it won't be cheap)/trade (only for something I truly want)

Enjoyable romp through a famous battle.  And yes, you can win as the Brits!  It's important to keep a track of which bridges get blown and to keep an eye open for where the Germans might exit and enter of the sides of the map -that can be sneaky.

A fast moving and fun game with simple mechanics. Can the British arrive in time to save the airborne from destruction?

Can support multiple players with the allies being split US/Brit.

Functional,clear graphics and low unit density make this an easy game to get to the table. Classic hex and counter approach.

It is old, but has aged well. You need to play it a few times as the bridge-blowing rolls may provide outlier results. Overall, it does a good job of capturing Operation Market Garden in a relatively simple format.

RATING: 9
A game I can remember playing in the 80s and finding it engrossing and entertaining but also simple. Lots of subtle things in this game - although the play around the bridges is a bit formulaic. Small map, low counter density, no stacking all means I can play it easily today as well.

A classic - a shame that the other games in the quad weren't up to the same standard.

RATING: N/A
For such a small approachable game, this was, and still is an excellent market garden game.  Don't bother with the other games in the Westwall Quad. SPI milked this game for all it was worth, giving it its own box etc.  With the way SPI cranked out games in the 70s a few had to stick and this is one of them.

RATING: 6.4
A fun, fast playing game that tends to follow the flow of the real battle.  

Tricky to win as the German, holding Nijmegen's bridge and cutting the LOC highway being crucial.  Remember the BrDf in Nijmegen can hold out like the Brits in Arnhem, until it gets a unit behind it courtesy of the engineers.

Against the Highway, the trick is to approach it without allowing the Allies the ability to encircle your troops and destroy them.  The CRT is practically bloodless, so encircling is the main way to eliminate units.  I suspect the German's best bet is to mass forces on both sides of the highway and then launch attacks from both sides at once.  But this takes time, and can be difficult if the bridge in Nijmegen is held as the XXX forces have nothing to do but protect the highway until the bridge is cleared.

Rules are simple, but read the section on the engineers and cities twice, as they are critical to both the flavor and the tactics of the game.

The die gives plenty of tense moments as the game progresses, especially for the Brits in Arnhem and the BrDf unit, but you rarely feel cheated.

I've yet to see a boring game, and am always left with the "just one more" sense.  Given the quick play time, that one more game is pretty easy to justify.

One of the best, old school, wargames out there.

I have the ziplock - "Moment in Conflict" version.

RATING: 9
Well-implemented game with minimal chrome to get in the way (but just enough to force you to pay attention!). Played solo and see lots of re-play potential. Allied airborne are critical to securing bridges, communications lines, etc., whilst the ground troops need to drive fast toward the Lower Rhine. Germans? Prevent the above and don't lose too many units or you will be ham-strung.

A wargame masterpiece.

Fairly well balanced and tense throughout, both players must pay attention to what they are doing with every unit the entire game. Winner is usually clear on the second-to-last turn, but sometimes a die roll at the end can change the outcome.

Not a slog in the trenches, this is a game of rapier German probes and thoughtfully parceled Allied resources. Not difficult to learn, rewards finesse in play.

Best folio-size game SPI produced.

I'm beer & pretzeling 'Arnhem' here at work tonight (solo), and I have to say it's pretty fun so far. 
Read the rules.  Scan = 15 minutes. Read in detail =45. Simple simple simple. 8 pages total w/no new concepts.
Low counter density helps with setup. Played several turns.
Brits made a successful mad-dash to the bridge, but are now pinned inside the city, and have lost the first of the three Arnhem hexes.
The Germans elected to attempt demolition of every bridge the Allies came to after landing, and were successful on 4 of 5, including both at Eindoven, slowing down the tanks right off.
Nijmegen cleared easily by the 82d, who are busting north to relieve the Brits.  Groesbeek heights are holding strong...
Two heavy German Mech / tank battalions have entered Venray to Oploo.... Amis racing to respond...
Need I say more?

RATING: 7
Old fashioned hex and counter game with a lot more going on than I expected. The basic rules are simple, but a fair number of flavour rules / exceptions spice things down a bit. There is much to plan for and initial play seems fairly slow. I'd like to play again to see if we could speed things up. The well designed scenario is perhaps the most attractive feature of this game, although some of the dated features (e.g. searching through the list for the next turns reinforcements rather than having off map boxes) can delay matters.

Hex and counter game which, despite showing it's age, is great fun thanks to an excellent scenario. Simple rules but with a lot to think about for each side. There are a couple of situations I am wary of, which may make or break the game (namely units holed up in a city) but for now I'm impressed with Arnhem. 

I'm surprised that anyone can play this in 90 minutes.

Played this one to death when I was a kid. Of all the SPI Quad games, this is one of the best for sheer fun and enjoyment. Today's designers would do well to take a look at this before they decide the world needs another 10k counter, twelve map, hundred page rulebook wargame that will sit on shelves instead of being played. 

Complexity is easy. Simplicity is genius.

I have a major problem with the Victory Conditions. If the British 1st Airborne rushes into Arnhem (which they probably should in order to mess up the Germans in a couple of ways)then they give up significant LOC points. With taking some  risks the Germans can cut the LOC of 1st British Airborne very early and then just collect ('farm', as noted by another Geek) the VP for the rest of the game. Even without essentially any risk, it is very likely that the 1st Airborne DZ will fall and the Germans will collect 100-200 VP. They have 0 incentive to eliminated ANY 1st Airborne units. At a minimum the non-LOC units should be allowed to 'surrender' and only give up 5 VP/unit.

I believe these Victory Conditions to be a fatal flaw unless XXX Corps can get significant units across the Waal River (which ALL 3 of the German NW reinforcements can move to help block as the British 1st Airborne isn't going anywhere).

In addition, several Canal/RR bridges can be avoided by the Airborne just to keep open LOC,the Germans can't attempt demolition on their own. And even if Allied units clearly control the areas on both sides of a bridge, it can still be blown if they come adjacent. (And why can't airborne LOC be traced over unbridged canals? These would be minor obstacles to such highly trained light troops.)

Lastly, the 17.31 rule on non-airborne LOC needs more explanation; it feels like gamely situations are very likely:
1)Must a unit use the 1st trail/road hex it traces to? Yes
2)If a unit resides on a trail road hex, is that the 1st hex of the LOC route? No
3)Can the LOC be (theoretically)infinitely long prior to connecting to a trail/road? Yes
4)Can the LOC pass through hexes the unit cannot enter? Yes
5)Is a trail/road hex a road hex or can it be chosen as either? Road

These are my opinions. What was the designer's intent with respect to his concept of the reality of the situation?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the best of the small map quad games. It uses most of the map The Germans are entering all along the flanks, the Allies are hanging on the the road. The game makes it tough to dislodge the 1st airborne at Arnhem and the German defenders at Nijmegen.
It has high replayability
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A moderately easy game to teach.  It is a good introduction to games that use supply lines for control of units.  The supply rules are fairly straight forward and does show why the Allied plan failed.  I find it very difficult for an Allied victory and it follows history very well.

Been playing Arnhem on Hexwar. It's a challenging fun game for both sides. Both sides accumulate victory points each turn and its great having the computer add them up for you. Having only played on Hexwar, I can't imagine manually counting up all the victory points each turn would be an enjoyable experience.  Been two EXPERIENCED players, difficult for Germans to win. If you don't believe me, go to Hexwar.com and play someone with a good record and you will soon pulling your German hair out.  Still a great game.

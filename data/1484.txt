Cool game. Somebody gets to be the thief who sneaks around the museum, while the other players try to find him before he escapes with the loot he takes.

Seems like it should be a great family game, but in our experience it doesn't work very well for gamers. The thief can't steal 3 paintings and escape. Ever.

1st play: not an amazing game, but better than your average kids game (excluding haba). Pretty random and I was happy to see it end

No 2nd play: Meh - After a couple of days, I just don't have any interest to play this again.

This is just a great game full of strategy and bluffing. The big problem with the game is if the thief is lying, cheating, or not playing properly you won't know until the round is over in about 15min. Not a good game to play with children or stupid adults.

i haven't played scotland yard, fury of dracula, or ghost chase so i don't have a real means of comparison.  this is that kind of game though, it plays fast, and it seems to accomplish its goals.  it was missing that magic for me though, and i'm not sure i wouldn't rather just play clue.  i ended up donating it to my clue-loving niece, and i'd still be willing to play it with her.

Why this has "Cluedo" (or Clue) stuck out at the front of its name is the real mystery.

Neither mechanics nor personnel resemble Cluedo in anyway.  This is very refreshing, as it is a much, much better game and fun to boot.

One player has to break into the museum and not get caught (by the other players) while heisting world-famous paintings.

Box condition is fair, with no split corners.  Remains of a price tag on the right side, some dishing of the lid, and worn corners are evident.  The game inside is complete with all pawns, window locks, art pieces/bases, video cameras, etc.  The red pawn's top is bent a bit and looks like it is nodding it's head, otherwise, everything else looks brand new.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Box is in very good condition...very slight dishing of the huge lid.  Negligible shelf wear.  Board and all pieces are present and accounted for, and then some.  The 9 paintings have 10 bases, the Thief plotting pad has all 50 pages still together, 11 labeled locks are present with a twelfth lock extra, 6 expected video cameras with a seventh camera extra, and both English and Spanish rule sets included.  Oh, and all seven pawns are there too.

A pretty good quality Clue game that doesn't really have anything in common with it's namesake.  I like the one versus the rest kind of game, and this one plays really fast.  It can be quite challenging for the thief if there are three detectives, but since each player acts as the thief once, this is balanced out.

Great game. Work together as 3 detectives trying to catch the thief (player 4). He charts his moves and is revealed when he steals a painting from right under your nose or you spot him with you line of sight that you can't use unless you roll that option. Maybe On your role you got the motion detector to know what room the thief is in or you rolled to see him on the super cameras, unless the thief snipped a camera wire or turned off the power. Somebody turn it back on to avoid being too blind before he leaves through a window or door. Oh drat, the detectives set up their 5 locked doors, and you found one. Now they know where you are and you need to find another exit bu coming back towards them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(KIDS) A very simple game of sneaking and catching.  It makes me think of Mr. Jack made simple.  There is opportunity to trick the other player and different ways to find the thief.  While I thought replayability may be an issue, it hasn't been.  I quite enjoyed my first two plays as detective and my first two plays as thief.  Works really well as a very fast, two player game.  It's also good with three or four and works with kids too.

A terrific hunt/chase game, I prefer it to Dracula.  Once the thief steals a painting, the hunters swarm, which adds tension to both the hunters and the hunted.  Also, the game doesn't add unnecessary padding (e.g. powers/options/abilities) it stands well on the central mechanic.

One of my favorite light games; people take turns being the thief, who steals paintings from an art museum. It's a blast! Also plays the perfect length for a light game. Each game with someone as a thief takes ~12 minutes, and there is about 3 minutes of setup in between, so in a group of 4 you can play with each person getting a chance to be the thief in 60 minutes!

My wife has steadily improved her opinion of the game over the years into one where she'll play it and wants to keep it for the future. I think if this wasn't a Clue derivative, it would see more BGG love. The only thing related to clue are the character namesakes which are completely irrelevant to the gamplay. Clue: Museum Caper actually has some strategically chops and tense choices: do I steal another painting or try to leave while I can?

Nothing to do with Clue. It's more like Scotland Yard. Except this game is broken by the die roll. If the guards rolls lots of motion sensors and camera rolls, the the thief has a hard time. If the guards roll nothing but eyes, the thief gets away with lots of art.

Great game that brings back many childhood memories. That being said, I've only ever played it with the house rule that the thief can return to hiding if he leaves the L.O.S. of the detectives/cameras. Without that amendment, I find that the game ends too quickly and that it skews too much in favor of the investigators.

[b]Clue: The Great Museum Caper[/b] does not play like the original [b]Clue[/b] at all.  Instead of solving the murder of Mr. Body, players take turns being a thief and try to steal as many paintings as they can from a museum.  The game uses a hidden movement mechanic where the thief tracks his movement on a separate piece of paper.

The game plays well, but a little bit gimmicky: the board is a large, 3-D and plastic, and it comes with lots of plastic pieces.  The box is large and typically Hasbro-thin, and is difficult to store.  I think the game is best for children 10-15 years of age.  For adults, I think there are better alternatives, such as [b]Scotland Yard[/b] or [b]Nuns on the Run[/b].

For something that was from Parker Brothers, this really wasn't half-bad (I realize as I say this how far Parker Brothers has fallen; they used to be a giant in the boardgame field, reliably publishing innovative games - almost all the classic American games are from Parker Brothers - but then the Great Depression hit). The thief plots his move behind a screen  and tries to steal art while the detectives try to catch him. It's fun filler to play with kids.

As a serious game though, I think it has major flaws. Both sides can be seriously and gratuitously hosed by the dice, and a detective who rolls poorly can end up doing nothing all game. The Thief role is very cool (although he too can get really hosed by the dice), but the game definitely is not as much fun for the detectives. And the spotting rules are very anti-intuitive - you can walk right by th thief in a narrow corridor and not see him, or search a small room and not find him because he's adjacent to you, but diagonally instead of orthogonally.

All in all, I don't think the game quite works well enough to recommend it for adult groups; play Sleuth instead (and someday I have to try Scotland Yard). As something to play with kids, though, I think it could be a winner.

A light press-your-luck art theft game in the style of Scotland Yard. The Clue name was simply for brand-recognition, as the games have little in common.  Possibly ahead of its time for the American market in 1991, and still quite fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I was really looking forward to playing this game after my wife and I found out we really enjoyed Sleuth (and I like Mr. Jack and Scotland Yard too). I did like Clue(do) as a child, but it overstayed its welcome and was too dependent on the luck of the dice. This game sounded like a great mix of all of these games. However, it didn’t quite live up to these expectations. 

When I read the rules it seemed like a great game, but the gameplay wasn’t that exciting. It was cool to try to deduce where the thief was, and I liked the features like how you could disable the cameras and such, but after the thief had 3 paintings and had to show himself before he was able to escape, the game turned out to be a roll-and-move game with a big chunk of luck; if the detectives rolled high numbers, they would win as they would be able to catch the thief before he escaped, but if they rolled low numbers, the thief would escape. Very anticlimactic after a somewhat interesting first half of the game. It’s a plus that the game plays very quickly.

This game is ridiculously fun.  For the hardcore gamers, don't be thrown off by the "Clue" label.  It's anything but.

Every time I take it over to non-gamers' houses, however, they always go wild and say "I love Clue, let's play!"  So it sort of works out, actually.  The game is not at all like Clue, but it's a really fun deduction game that I think is quite well balanced between the detective and thief roles.

This game, despite the title, really has nothing to do with Clue. Rather, it is a variant on the Scotland Yard / Fury of Dracula type game where one player plots hidden moves while the other players pursue them. In this case, the thief player is trying to nab as many pieces of art as possible from a museum that is rigged with cameras and motion detectors. The other players on their turn have to roll two dice. One is a standard six sided one that tells how far they can move, the other shows how they can try to view the thief, either with their eyes/the cameras, with all of the cameras, or with the motion detectors.

In effect, the game plays out quickly, and is fairly interesting. I think the game is much more engaging for the thief, even playing with 2, as he simply seems to have more fun moves and strategy while the other player(s) are simply trying to intuit where he is going and how he is going to move. The game is ultimately heavy on the guesswork, but I found it fairly engaging and worth pulling out every once in a while. In its genre, it is miles beyond more gussied up, chrome-laden affairs like Fury of Dracula in terms of both meaningful decisions per minute and playtime.

May go up with additional plays if it turns out to actually be hard to catch a dedicated thief.  The first play was pretty fun.  We did play that you could move through the detectives that turns out to not be the rule.  But without the rule it seems almost impossible to get into some rooms to steal a painting.  So we shall see.

Clue was my favorite game growing up so I had to have all the different versions. This was the most unique and a great game on its own.

The game is a one vs. many semi-cooperative based on the same premise as Scotland Yard. Here, one player is breaking into the museum, trying to steal as many paintings as possible and escape while the other players want to prevent just that.

The investigators have additional equipment (cameras and motion detectors) that help them spot the thief. What they can do and how far they can move on a turn depends on the dice, so there is quite a bit of luck involved (and with a few good rolls, very hard for the thief). It's a quick and tense game, though, and surprisingly fun for such a mainstream offering. I suspect it works even better as a kids game.

Oh, and it doesn't have anything to do with Clue, really.

Clue: TGMC has what I was looking for in a game like this: easy game-play with a healthy side of deduction and early 90s production values.  I enjoyed it more than Scotland Yard, that's for sure, and has a similar feel to Stop Thief!  At the end of the day the die rolls can have a lot more effect on how the game plays out than anyone's actual ability to make good deductive inferences, but for a brainy kid's game it works well with adults alike. Should have continued to be a staple game like Clue or Guess Who.

The basic deduction element is similar to [b]Scotland Yard[/b].  Compared to [b]Scotland Yard[/b], there is greater freedom of tactics for the thief, but, conversely, it is more difficult for the other players to effectively create a net.  However, it also plays much faster, so everyone can take a turn at being the thief, which is really the most fun.  It is probably best with 4 or 5, but it also plays great with just 2 if the non-thief player controls two or three characters.  More characters allows more area to be covered, but it also allows more moves for the thief between a given character's turns.

Yea, it's roll & move, but it's a heck of a lot more fun than Mr. Jack.  I mean really, who doesn't want to be the thief trying to run circles around the detectives.

There really is room for some bluffing and deduction going on.  I'm not sure how balanced it is or how it is with 4 players, but that doesn't stop me from saying this is a darn fun game.

Not a bad little game, but I haven't played it since high school, so I don't feel as though I can judge it.

I plan to move it up from my parents' place next time I'm home and try it out again.

Clue: The Great Museum Caper is my first try at hidden movement and what a great introduction it was.  I feel like the game is more balanced towards a full four player count, but works very well at two and three.  I love the dynamic of thief versus captors and the flow of the game works really well.  There's also a good amount of luck in that thieves may find themselves caught almost immediately just depending on how things turn out.  At the same time, a thief may be able to clear out a whole side of the museum without even being seen.  I like it though.  It plays quick and, after one game, everyone wants a shot at being the thief.

Very well-conceived Clue game. There's enough deduction work to make the game interesting, and its pretty fun to sneak around under the noses of the detectives. Components are great, the board may be oversized, but it adds to the theme.

Minor gripe with the dice rolling. A variance of 1 to 6 means a string of lucky rolls (or unlucky) can decide the game. I would use 2,3,3,4,4,5

This is a deduction game in a way.  All but one player play the investigators.  They set up the cameras paintings and starting spots.  The thief is invisible and keeps track of his movements on a sheet of paper.  The investigators move around trying to find him and can only see in the direction of a rook however only when they claim they are looking rather than checking cameras or motion sensors.  If a camera sees him the players don't know where he is but know he is in the cameras path.  If a person sees him then he is put onto the board and must move around from there.

This is a great game.  Unfortunately, it's no longer in print.  It's pretty easy to find on e-bay though.  I got mine for only $1.50 plus shipping.  The game has absolutely no resemblance to the original Clue game.  It's similar to Scotland Yard, but much better.  I think it would appeal to both casual gamers and hardcore ones.  It can get a little tense, especially if you are the thief and the detectives are closing in.  Being the thief is definitely more fun than being a detective, so be sure to take turns.  I highly recommend this game.  It lots of fun, the quality of the game board is the best I've seen in a game, and it's not overly complicated.

Having played this again just recently... I have to say it's pretty fun, even if it really has NOTHING to do with the game CLUE... other than the fact that the characters are Col. Mustard, Miss Scarlett, and so on...

It is fun being the thief... but sometimes it can be quite difficult to NOT BE FOUND!!!  I think it's a little easier for the thief if there are MORE characters wandering around than less...  

Game doesn't take very long to play... So, it's not a bad idea to give each player a chance at being THE THIEF!!!

I'm glad I kept this one in my collection...  Too Bad Parker Brothers doesn't still make this one...  They should bring this back sometime along with Clue: Master Detective!!!

While the game is far better than Scotland Yard, it's not the most interesting hidden movement.

The components are fantastic and I like the theme, but the game is too sterile for my enjoyment.

RATING: 7
Clue only in name -- there's deduction involved, but not the same kind of deduction. It's a blast as the robber, and pleasantly tense. As the investigators, you can sometimes get tripped up by poor rolls, but having multiple investigators on the board helps to mitigate this.

My favorite thing about playing the investigators is setting up the board -- aiming for maximum coverage, avoiding building in any fatal flaws, and trying to give the robber an opportunity that isn't quite as good as it looks.

Really just a good game, and under-appreciated.

As noted, this is not a Clue game, it's a hidden movement variant that for me is more fun than the original, which a ton more strategy.  If you lose, 90% of the time you caused it.  Successfully getting out of the museum as the thief is a truly satisfying experience.  Worth the cheap Ebay prices!

My nostalgia game from childhood that I finally found in a thrift store.  The game is the same as I remember it, and if I had never gotten into gaming then I would still think it's AWESOME.  Now, I can think of many other games that do what this game does better, but I still enjoy it for the occasional light fun.

Being the thief is a bit nerve racking, and being the Clue characters is more like an Easter egg hunt.  Fun to play once, and will probably play it again some day, but it's not addictive in any way.

Clue variant that's actually pretty good, where one player runs around stealing & destroying while the others try to find & capture him before he splits with the loot.  Sometimes it's too easy to spot the thief (a lucky guess).  Being the thief = 6; being a detective = 4.

This game might not set the world on fire, but for an early 90's spin-off of an established game, this is shockingly good.  It's like a *very* light version of Fury of Dracula.  If you want the stealth movement of that game, but would prefer to finish in 20 minutes, this is a nice option.

Bought for $2 at Goodwill. Missing 3 of the little generic character pieces. Looks to have been someone's trampoline at some point.

After reading the rules on a play-by-forum thread for the game, it sounds pretty interesting.

Played it, and it IS interesting. It suffers a bit from the roll and move mechanic, but the other die isn't a problem as none of its faces are useless. Trying to catch the thief when all you can roll are ones, or trying to escape when your pursuers are rolling sixes is frustrating. Still, the game provides quite a bit of tension.

Good deduction game although the rules are a little bit counterintuitive.

First of all let me say that other than the names of the characters in the game, this has no resemblance to Clue. In this game 1 player takes on the role of the thief each round while the other players try to catch him in the museum. The thief is trying to escape with as many paintings as possible. Each player plays as the thief once and the player who stole the most paintings without getting caught is the winner.

Probably more fun if you're the thief, otherwise, it's just random searching until you encounter the thief. Probably more strategic if there are more players. Maybe you should play with all the players anyway, just to even the odds a bit more. Might give it another try with all characters in play.

While this game carries the "Clue" name, it's not really related to the original game except in name. 

The goal of this game is for 1 player to act as a thief in the museum and take at least 3 painting without being caught. The rest of the players work together to capture the thief who gets to move around the board in a mostly invisible state. 

Play once with each player acting as thief to give everyone a chance.

This is a great family game. I had a blast playing it with my 8 year old daughter. We played it again immediately after our first game which is always a good sign. Replacing the pawns with minis really helps. It is easy to retheme also. I replaced the pawns with space marines and the thiefs pawn with an alien.

RATING: N/A
Outstanding! One of the best deduction games! This game is so good! It is simple to learn, teach and play. It is incredibly fun! If you are a fan of deduction games, this is one you should own. You can be the thief or the investigator(s). There are so many wonderful variables in this game. For example, the security cameras, the hidden motion detectors in the walls, the power room...which cuts off all power to the security features...not to mention the information learned from the dice roll). The mechanics of the game are really outstanding. The dice mechanic is not your typical luck based non-interesting event. The dice provide the investigators with fun and valuable information. 

This is a game in the style of Scotland Yard, Ghost Chase, and/or Fury of Dracula. One person is the thief and the other player or players are the investigators tracking down the thief. I am most impressed that this game is unique in it's own right and I do not mind owning and playing this deduction game, even though I have other similar types of games. My wife is not a huge fan of this style of game, but she always seems to be willing to play Fury of Dracula, Ghost Chase, and now this game. In fact this one is so quick to play it may end up coming out the most.

Why hasn't this one been reprinted?

Cat & mouse type game with multiple players working together against a single thief player. Can work with 2 players if one player controls multiple characters.

Quite a lot of random elements (movement dice rolls, locks, etc.) compared with e.g. Scotland Yard, but they appear to be well balanced.

NOTE: There are apparently a few parts of the rules that aren't entirely clear. Mostly regarding movement restrictions, whether the thief can walk through other characters, and whether exact movements are needed to capture the thief, or disable a camera etc.
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/245657

NOTE: UK edition doesn't have the "Clue"/"Cluedo" prefix to the name. The rules are also clearer on a few points, mostly regarding camera usage (can be orthoganl or diagonal).

Very clever mechanics and good for a laugh or two.

Enjoyed playing this with my dad. It is a good variant of the hidden movement game (such as Scotland Yard or Fury of Dracula). The artwork and playing pieces are very nice and the mechanics work well. I also enjoyed being subject to motion alarms and cameras. A nice way to track the bad guys movement was to actually nick the paintings from the gameboard, which added greatly to the rage of the detective and the fun.

After a few more plays, I don't really see much from this game. I think the idea is great, but the thief can really get screwed on the dice rolls.

Classic family game of deduction.  Players race around a museum trying to track down an art thief played by one of the players all before the thief steals the paintings.  The player playing the thief moves in secret around the museum.  The other players try to track the thief down using cameras, motion detectors or visually searching the museum until they catch him or the thief escapes.

Pros: fun interaction with other players, deductive reasoning , group discussions and interactions, easy gameplay.semi cooperative gameplay.

Cons:no deep strategic thinking.

I enjoyed my singular play of this title.  Second guessing the location of the thief can be quite challenging, and watching a painting disapear in the same room as a player really gives you a 'pink panther' feel.
I think the mechanics are sound on this one since players quickly realize the general vacinity of the thief, but must still problem solve in order to go for the capture.
The game seems overproduced component wise for sure, yet some of the theme is missing from reading the rules or what character you are...  (which, I believe, was one of the biggest draws to the original game)

This is a [i]everybody vs. the bad guy[/i] type of game.  I like competitive games better, but my former group seemed to enjoy this one a lot.  I just haven't been able to substract from their absolute joy environment, so I kind of like this game too, with some distance.  Speaking of other things:  What do Col. Mustard, Miss Scarlet and all the Clue crew do in a Museum just the night that someone breaks in?  Mmm, perhaps they had a problematic childhood, but this people seem to be always in the wrong place at the wrong moment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game can go long if you can't get a read on the thief right away, there's a lot of ambiguity in the rules, including there not being a victory condition, an updated rule set with a little more balance might be all this game needs to be MUCH better than it currently is, and currently it's enjoyable.  The simple concept allows it to be explained in minutes to anyone as long as they're not playing the thief.

update:
This is a really fun idea for a game but a too conservative thief is almost impossible to catch, and frustrating to play against. perhaps a turn counter could help the game "rob the museum before sunrise". It's also simply too big to store for the amount of time I'd play it.

Easily the best of the [b]Clue[/b] games, but admittedly this only has a passing resemblance to the classic game (i.e. some deductive reasoning) but for the most part it is completely different mechanics - more like [b]Scotland Yard[/b], actually.

Tense and fun 'Police and Thief' style game. One player is a thief trying to steal three paintings and get out of the museum. The detectives get to place and use cameras and line of sight to see the thief. Dice are rolled to determine detective movement as well as activation of cameras or motions sensors. Lovely plumage. It's not like Clue/do at all...in fact, it's more like Scotland Yard and Fury of Dracula.

The game works well.  It is a puzzling scenario.  It is kind of hard playing the thief.  You need to be trepidacious, the board isn't that large and the thief can only move three spaces.  Whereas the line of sight and big movement on the "good guys" part really leaves little room for the thief. With a lucky roll a scan and a 5 die roll the thief can be exposed and caught easily.  Still, it is quick and exciting.

Very fun game.  The 3D aspect of the board doesn't really have anything to do with the gameplay, but it does look pretty.  And it seems a little odd that the thief can't necessarily exit by the same entrance they came in--not smart enough to leave it unlocked?--but it makes sense in game terms.

Clue: The Great Museum Caper

It's a perfect night for a robbery - and you're the Thief!

Join Colonel Mustard and all your favorite CLUE game characters as they try to catch the thief who's broken into Mr. Boddy's private art museum and is snatching priceless paintings from under their very noses!

In this 3-D game of detection and evasion, one of you will play the invisible Thief and make all your moves in secret behind the Thief's shield.  The other players will work together to sniff out your whereabouts, lay chase, and prevent your getaway!

Which character will be the one to catch you?  Or will you make your escape and slip into the night with all your loot?

Whoever wins, Clue The Great Museum Caper game is sure to be the greatest heist in history!

You'll take turns being the invisible Thief, marking all your moves on the Thief Plotting Pad and sneaking around the museum - completely hidden from the other players!

"Can Camera No. 6 see you?"  Players roll the special Eye, Video Camera and Motion Detector die and track the Thief within the walls of the 3-D museum game board.

But the cagey culprit can disconnect cameras, snip wires, even shut down the entire security system - and, one by one snatch the priceless paintings during this daring art heist! 

This game is in GOOD condition.  It is ALMOST COMPLETE, and includes:

Original game box (some wear) 
3-D game board 
Thief Shield 
9 paintings with plastic stands 
Plotting pad 
6 player pawns 
1 Thief pawn (Missing) 
6 video cameras 
11 window locks (1 Missing in One Game) 
2 dice 
Rules in English 
Rules in French 
The box shows surface wear.

RATING: 5.5
An underrated little thing, sort of Scotland Yard-ish.  But one really must play this in such a way that everyone is the thief once, else there's really no way to judge whether or not the thief "won" if he chooses to steal only a few paintings then get out.

Fun hidden movement game. My major problem with it is that I could never quite figure out how many people made for a good, balanced, experience. It always seemed either too difficult or too easy for the burglar.

Clue: The Great Museum Caper is a secret movement co-op that doesn't bring too much new to the genre.  Since the thief moves before EVERY player's turn, downtime becomes an issue.  The big plastic museum is a big bonus.

RATING: N/A
First play impression: Really fun game. The thief runs around and grabs paintings, deactivates security cameras, and then tries to escape all while hidden.

The end-game might be a little weak, but will need to play more to see. When the thief tries to escape he has to go to a door or window and flip over a lock. If the door/window is open, he escapes and wins the game. If the door/window is locked, he has to try to move to a different door/window to try his luck. The problem is that he reveals his location when flipping over a lock, so he will usually be caught on the very next turn if he's unable to escape.

Still, a fun little game and if this end-game issue becomes a problem it should be easy enough to come up with a solution.

Not really Clue, but a fun game.  Kinda in the realm of Scotland Yard, but not as difficult for the thief.  Fun time every time we've played.

RATING: 7
Good Hunter-Prey game.

Nothing like Clue, just branding.

If you like Scotland Yard then this is another one to own and well worth picking up if you see it at a thrift store.

Update: Rating stays the same.  This is a good game.  It suffers the same problem all of these games suffer from - it is more fun to be the hunted than the hunter.

I also wish it accomodated more players.

I recommend you thrift the newer versions of Clue and scavenge the figures from that to use in this game.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1

I like this game a lot.  Being the caper is by far the most enjoyable role in the game.  Trying to figure out how to break in, steal as many paintings, escape before getting caught.  Pretty enjoyable but hard to get people to play this one.

I really enjoyed this when I was a kid.  The 3-D-ness of the board doesn't really have any function but to look cool, but it *does* look cool.

*This* was a Mensa Select game?  Makes me glad I'm not a member.  We were very excited to get this game when it came out, and after about 5 plays decided it was so bad we gave it away.  I'm probably being charitable with that 3 rating.  Game mechanic, while not broken, seems to heavily favor the thief if I remember rightly.  Avoid.

This is a good hidden movement game that was lost in a move. I actually wish I still had it, or something like it.

RATING: 8
Just for the record, this is nothing like Clue.

It's a hidden movement game a bit like Scotland Yard, but it's a lot more fun.

I'd probably rate it higher if I were better at hidden movement, but I'm not, so I don't play it very often.

But the game itself is very cool. The robber is stealing art. He can disable cameras in the building, among other things. The detectives are trying to get him before he sneaks out the building.

In fact, after writing this, I'm upping my rating from 7.5. This game was way ahead of its time.

I haven't played this since I was a kid, so it was neat to get a chance to pull it out this weekend.  You can get in a round for each player to be the thief fairly quickly, which makes it nice.  It's pretty tricky to play as the thief and try to nab paintings without being caught.  In our 4P game, we only had one thief escape.  Blast that Colonel Mustard and his insatiable hunger for mutton sandwiches!

I have so many memories with this game with my family.  The game said 2-4 can play but we never played that way.  We would have 6 or 7 people playing the game.  One would be the thief and the rest would be the detectives trying to find the thief.  The great thing about the game is that everyone would be talking around the table trying to figure out where the thief would be. Everyone was invited to talk about it and the thief would have to listen to all of the plans.  The game has a great balance of game play with party fun collaboration.
The game play for the thief is the best because they can shut off the electricity to the building and break cameras.  This of course adds a layer of intrigue because when the thief does this the players know where he is but do not the advantages of seeing the thief.

Similar to Scotland Yard in that the "bad guy" is invisible.  This is a nice and quick game, with a bit of a push your luck element for the thief.  I'd like to try with more than two players to see if it changes anything.

I'm reluctant to assign a numerical rating to [i]Museum Caper[/i], as the average rating is currently 6.66 and His Satanic Majesty wouldn't approve if that number were to slip. But after consulting with a priest and rabbi I've relented and anointed the game with a holy "6".

Skipping the rest of the prologue:

I can only imagine that this would have been a great "sibling" game in my youth.  As a bonus - even today -  it's a lot shorter than [i]Scotland Yard[/i] and a hell of a lot shorter than [i]Letters from Whitechapel[/i].

Having experienced it initially as an adult, however, I doubt that I'll play again.

Fun and fast deduction game. 1 against everybody else adds a different twist to the standard deduction game. Variable setup and different risk-taking by the thief offers a enough replayability. Great fun game - a bit underrated in my opinion.

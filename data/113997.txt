I like the idea but it needs tweaking. Too much detail on the cards to see easily at a glance, too much time in between player moves if players progress at different rates. Fury of Dracula meets Dixit, which should be awesome but it's just not quite.

The blurb of it being a mashup of Dixit and Clue are spot on. The artwork is gorgeous and I think works well. I like the Ukrainian rules better, but that's more of a personal preference. This is agonizing to play with people you know, and it sort of falls flat when you don't know anyone else in the group and you've never played with them as having a rudimentary understanding of how people think is the crux of the deduction meta-game... I agree it's best around 5 players (including the ghost). One of the few coops that I keep on hand anymore.

20ish games later, and I'm still happy to pull it out, a game that has serious staying powering (even if we don't play games of it each week anymore).

edit: only took me almost 30 to win... This is the problem when you play with new people almost every time, you never develop that unwritten language on how to communicate certain things. Still my coop of choice because it solves a large chunk of (but not all of) the traditional coop problem of QBs. Plus, it's so beautiful.

Interesting game. Sort of a Co-op Dixit.

I like it better than a lot of co-ops in that you don't really have the leader mechanic.

There are a couple of logical issues in that players are trying to identify weapons and places that weren't part of the murder, but that is a minor issue at most.

There could be some replayability issues if the same group plays over and over, but again, minor possible issue.

Decent and fun game that could appeal to non-gamers in a gamer group. There will be many people who will love the game because of the artistic and deductive elements.

I missed the chance to demo this at BGG Con 2014, but ended up buying a copy for my wife for Christmas (thank you international BGG vendors!). This is a great little game. I've never been a huge fan of Dixit, but this takes most of what I like from that game and makes it an enjoyable (and challenging) co-op. We've won only about half the time so it is not easy, even after many plays.

RATING: 7
A unique co-operative game that combines aspects of Clue and Dixit in a very original and engaging way.

The game lasts a maximum of seven rounds (7 days to make 1 week)with one player taking on the role of the ghost, whose job it is is to provide Dixit like clues (visions) to each of the other players, whose job it is to figure out, in order, the potential murder weapon, the potential murder location, and the potential murderer.  The ghost has a very unique and challenging role, as they cannot speak, they are limited to the cards they have available to distribute and they have a hand limit.  The other players work together to help each other and can proceed through their discoveries at different paces, but they must all get to the final murderer by the end of the week or everyone loses.

The artwork is very Dixit like but also has a real Eastern European look to it, the rules are very simple, the games plays from 2-7 players, and it is fairly quick to play.  It's great fun if you like co-ops, and/or Dixit, and/or possibly party games.  I'm not normally a fan of co-ops but this is a very enjoyable game.

Own the [boardgame=183431]Hidden Signs[/boardgame] expansion and a homemade copy of [boardgame=168487]Plansza Ducha[/boardgame].

Undoubtedly the best cooperative game I have played. The artistry is incredible, and the game concept is ingenious. It is so intuitive that you can set the game up and start playing with barely a rules explanation. There are elements of Dixit (one of my very favourite games) but this game has a fantastic, immersive, logical theme. It tells great stories. 

It should never have been advertised as a 7 player game though: there is far too much book-keeping for the ghost player, and far too much downtime for the psychics who can't all crowd around one players' cards to work together. This is a game which should be limited to 5 players max. The rulebook (official English translation from BGG files) is a little unclear about a few things but thankfully the system is quite flexible and forgiving, so house-rules are not game-breaking. Overall though, the gameplay is so simple that it's not a problem.

As with Dixit, the selection of cards could become repetitive which might affect replay-value. Dixit overcomes this with a ton of expansion decks; I hope this game gets the same treatment.

I love brilliant, truly innovative, beautiful game-design and this game has that sense of being something genuinely new.

I played the Polish edition at BGG.Con 2014.  The game is interesting and can be fun, but I don't feel the excitement for the game that many others seem to.  I haven't played the 2-player rules, but I feel like it would not be interesting in that format since the "psychic" player has no one to discuss ideas with.  I also suspect that playing the game a lot will make it easier as players learn associations between certain cards, which stood out to me in my limited plays.  I suppose that could be mitigated by replacing/supplementing the dream cards with Dixit cards, which I haven't tried but seems like it would work.  I also feel like the game currently suffers from a lack of consistency between rules sets.  I played with two different groups in my 3 plays, and played by two different rules sets.  I'd prefer there to be a single official rules set, but as a cooperative game, this isn't too big of a deal.

All things considered, Mysterium is a good game, but not one I am desperate to add to my collection.  I'll probably pick up a copy when the English edition is released.

+Very interesting idea to have asymmetrical gameplay in a coop.  A few games have done something similar, but this game has a nice twist on it.
+Very simple rules set that could be learned by gamers and non-gamers of every experience level.
+Allows for a good amount of cooperation.

-Can have significant down time with higher player counts and/or a slow ghost player.
-Could be easily susceptible to alpha-player syndrome.
-Seems to be fairly easy to win.

RATING: 4
Aesthetically, the game looks cool and the art design is terrific. But who cares when the gameplay is so mundane? It's Clue with a ghost/DM element. That's it. This was easily the most-hyped game of Gen Con 2015 and the biggest disappointment. Looks like lots of cases of Emperor's New Clothes with this one. If you're looking for fun party/social games, you can do much better, and for cheaper.

RATING: 5
Clever idea, but it didn't quite gel for me -- it seemed unnecessarily fiddly, and there was no "why" to the mystery, which left me kind of flat when we solved the puzzle. There are some compelling ideas here -- I like the idea of communicating with a restless spirit (as a game -- no Ouija, bro), and only being able to do so via abstract imagery was cool -- but I didn't quite get the "why." A decent enough little filler, maybe, but there are a lot of moving parts (literally), and a lot of other little fillers I'd rather play.
[u]edit[/u]: I see there's an expansion for motive cards. Maybe that would fix the game for me.

Another tremendous co-op. Never played dixit, but I might just buy it for more ghost cards. Lot of replayability - can lead to some funny meta moments and I enjoy the very different challenges that the ghosts and the psychics both get.

Play with the "Full Investigation" rules (easy to find online). Get the Polish version of the game - it has the best artwork, and the best set of pieces.  Buy some scrabble-style card holders for the "ghost" to use.  The English version has the most boring/cartoon-like artwork and the easiest rule set - it is worth buying the Polish version online and then printing out the English version of the rules (again, easy to find online).

RATING: 5
Initial thoughts: Lovely, absurdist artwork. Interesting game-play where you try to discern what the "ghost" is trying to tell you with the cards they give you. Lots of chatter which some people might like.

Playing as the ghost makes this a 6. Playing as the psychics leaves me a little cold but I am not the biggest coop fan so take the rating with a grain of salt.

"[b]Dixit[/b] with a point" is an adequate description.  Neat premise.  The execution is still very much read-my-mind with pictures.  The art is, of course, amazing.  I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll buy it.

RATING: 8
+ Lost Letter Promo.

Mysterium is really great and for someone like me, who studies translation and communication, it's also a fascinating experience. You have the information and you're trying to transmit it to the other players without talking... just using pictures. It's very interesting! Mysterium does also everything right to be a good cooperative game: it's tense, it's difficult and it has a very nice theme, but it also doesn't suffer of the aplha-gamer problem, because nobody can be 100% sure about the meaning of the dream cards. 

I also think that Mysterium is one of the best gateway games out there... way better than something like Ticket to Ride or other "classics" for a lot of reasons. It has simple rules and beautiful components like other games, but it also goes up to 7 players, it has the visual impact of Dixit and the basic concept of Clue, that a lot of people already know, and it's cooperative, which allows for a friendlier game-play and it's something completely new for those who only played Monopoly and Risk. I really can't think of any other game that would be better as a gateway experience!

Overall an excellent and beautiful light cooperative game, that can be played with everybody and I'm really glad to have in my collection.

As commented elsewhere this is a cross between Dixit and Cluedo (and not as good as either). Theme is weak and very light. It is very easy with 3 or fewer players even at difficult levels. Best with 4+ players and difficult/very difficult level. Not much replayability, you'll quickly want new cards. The kids enjoyed it though but not as much as Dixit.

RATING: 7
A co-op game in which one player (the ghost) provides clues to the others (psychic investigators) about the what, where and whodunnit of a murder.  Since the clues take the form of dreams it is apt that surreal Dixit-esque cards are used.  A ticking clock (there are but seven turns) puts pressure on the investigators to waste no time in figuring out what on earth the ghost is trying to tell them. Playing the ghost is frustrating in a good way as you mutely watch investigators misinterpret their dreams and doggedly persist up blind alleys. The game lies in the interpretation of those cards more than the kind of logical deduction that a Sleuth or a Tragedy Looper demand. Mysterium plays briskly and packs in moments of tension and laughter.  I like it.

Production quality of my Portal edition is good.  The artwork is Dixit standard lovely.  The English translation of the rules downloaded from BGG is clear and readable.

An excellent co-op game that manages to produce its desired effect:  a ghost (one player) mysteriously communicating in dreams (providing only atmospheric mysterious art on cards) to the other players in an effort to lead them to the truth as to who committed a crime, with what instrument, in which room.  Yes, Dixit meets Clue, and the result is a magical gaming experience.  Nicely done.

I don't feel comfortable rating this one after just one play. The game didn't seem fully developed. With a few ways to adjust difficulty we played with a level slightly above 'normal'. It was very easy. There were prominent items on the dream cards that matched prominent items on the investigation cards, which made some clues ridiculously easy. 

I'd like to play again with the difficultly cranked to full. There is a decent game here somewhere. Three people, playing their first game on a normal and then slightly harder level shouldn't be breezing through this game easily. I blame the idiots who complain games are too hard because they don't have the patience for a challenge.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Overall, the game is imaginative, interactive, unique, engaging, and incredibly fun. The rules are simple and the dixit-esque element works brilliantly. This is one of the rare games that seems great for families and gamers alike. 

That being said, set-up is a bit fiddly and I HIGHLY suggest using card-holders for the ghost player as he/she is constantly examining and re-examining cards. 

As far as game-play is concern, it is much more difficult being the ghost player. Trying to match dream cards to specific players, manage your hand, and restrain yourself for calling specific psychics complete idiots for missing something obvious is... difficult. Furthermore, it is easy to forget about the red-herring cards when matching dream cards... which often make the perfect dream ambiguous to the psychic players. And lastly, having a ghost player who is familiar with the cards will go a long way... as they won't be studying the board and slowing down the game. But overall, the game doesn't drag on.

As far as difficulty goes, this game is quite difficult on easy and is much harder with larger player counts. At this point, I can't imagine anyone beating the hardest difficulty without a deep knowledge of the game and the playing style of the ghost player. I suspect most players will enjoy this game at lower player counts (3-4) but I did play it at 6-players and had a good time.

Kicsit sarkosan fogalmazva egy Dixites Cluedo. Sajnos a két parti egyikében sem jutottunk el odáig, hogy az esetek közül kiválasszuk azt az egy bizonyosat, de így is átjött a lényeg. Szerintem ez többek közt azért jobb a Dixitnél, mert itt nem olyan nagy előny, ha egy pár összeszokott, mert előre megadott dolgokra kell asszociálni, nem pedig olyanokra, amiket senki más nem ismer azon a két emberen kívül... Szívesen játszom még vele, meg kipróbálnám a Mysteriumot is, hogy mi a különbség a kettő közt. (bár ha jól látom ugyanaz a játék hivatalosan, de mi nem a Mysteriummal, hanem a Tajemnicze-vel játszottunk)

Nice concept although the realisation does not really make sense, if you are willing to nitpick. Very nice brainworker although only after a few games (normal difficulty for now only) i can see how the investigators might get to understand the way the ghost player's mind works and might go for specific stuff in his clues (but then again the same could be said for other coop games like Hanabi). In any case, a game I can see hitting the table way too many times in the near future, especially with new people/non-gamers.

This game is of course the bastard son of Dixit and Clue. Or, as someone is saying, it is Dixit with a theme.

Gameplay is simple but clever: using clues based on gorgeous dreamlike cards, one of the players (the ghost) tries to communicate with the others. It is a cooperative game and the goal is to find a combo of culprit, weapon and location.

The artwork is of course the main attraction, and all types of cards have a twisted "Dixity" feel, but in a way that seem spawned by the mind of David Lynch. In particular, I love the way the location cards depict creepy rooms or landscapes.

Mysterium is not my type of game, like Dixit isn't, but it definitely is a worthy interesting game, and one of the best in its genre.

Olyan tipikus álomszerű káosz, ami hozza is a realitást, de néha képtelenség volt a nyomozóknak bármiféle közös halmazt alkotni a kártyákkal. Továbbra is inkább a kis fakockás Eurogém.

I really think that "Dixit" is not worth buying if You see this game once. I mean, if You have kids or You're a kid "Dixit" is cool. But this game has strong theme which is a murder You have to solve. It is way much tougher than "Dixit". Pictures ("dreams") are more complex, it is not easy to solve what specific card means.
- game type: co-op. In "Dixit" You have rivarly. 
- playing time (approx 60 minutes)
- this game is more "depressing" than funny but it is awesome.
- can be a great party game
- to play this game You have to gather proper people

A really neat mash-up of Dixit-like clue giving, and Clue, where you'e trying to find out whodunnit, where, and with what.

Every round, the ghost gives clues to the players in the form of picture cards.  The players try to figure out what thing, place, or person that card best relates to in order to get closer to solving the mystery.

It's really tricky, as the cards are fairly detailed, and the various details often have you second guessing yourself.

Very unique, and lots of fun!

Portal publishes a co-op I actually like, again. For a language independent game, there is a LOT of subtle communication that happens. If you have a good ghost, the images can weave wild stories leading the investigators to the right suspect/location/weapon. Two thumbs up from me.

RATING: 8
Co-op deduction-lite game where the main thrust of the game is one player has to communicate to everyone the answer to the puzzle without talking, but using only a set of wonderfully illustrated cards. The fun is trying to guess what the "ghost" is trying to tell you. Simple in theory, and a lot of fun in practice. This game is challenging even on easy, and it may run a little long, but it is very much worth checking out. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a great game and really takes the idea of Dixit and turns it into something extremely cool. You have to get into the ghost's head about what they see in each picture to make your guess and certainly having help from your fellow investigators is very much welcome. The game is tough as you have to get 4 correct guesses in 7 tries, which is not as easy especially if the ghost is not just making it simple and following what would be a common theme.

I can't speak highly of this enough, and I'm really happy I sprung for the Polish version as this game has a permanent place in my collection and I'd be happy to bring it out with anyone at any time.

Has (fairly) been described as Clue meets Dixit.  The play experience was a lot closer to Dixit for me.   I don't generally like co-ops or group-think games, but this one worked surprisingly well since everybody has their own puzzle to solve and the co-op part is nothing more than asking others to help if you want it.   The role of the ghost player seems interesting, although the suggestions by some that the game should come with a gauze mask is perhaps a little dubious.   This skews towards an "experience game" more than anything else.   I enjoyed it and would be happpy to play it more.  Like Dixit, I wonder if the shelf life could be limited.

Pitched as a cooperative version of Dixit, it honestly only feels like a game for the one person playing the ghost and the rest of us are just “audience members” reacting to clues.  Its an enjoyable experience.  I’ve never played ‘the ghost’ and honestly, after looking at all the preparation and rules consultation they do, don’t really have any desire to; it seems like a lot of effort for such little return.  I still prefer Dixit a lot more to this game because in Dixit you are an acting participant (each and every person), yet here (unless you are the ‘ghost’) we are just re-acting to what is presented to us.  Still its and enjoyable experience; its like watching someone put on a magic show they prepared for you.  It’s entertaining.

  It is slightly bewildering as to how popular this has become.  People call it a cross between Dixit and Cluedo (Clue in the US).  But whilst I like both of those games this falls flat with me completely.    Trying to deduce the card that is being explained just seems so random given all the cards are a mess of colour and images.  

Clearly I am missing something as this is popular right now.

Lots of people have said this is co-op Clue meets Dixit. I would completely agree with this. Each round the ghost player silently gives Dixit-esque cards  to the other players. The players try to figure out which is their person/place/thing based on the strange card they've been given. Once they've figured out one of these, you move onto the next category. If all players get all of their people/places/things within a specified number of turns, there will be a final collective guess for which set among all of the players sets is actual circumstance of the ghosts murder based on exactly three dream cards the ghost provides as clues. This is extremely fun and is a great rules-light game that can be used as a gateway game. 

Gamers seem to like it a bit more than Dixit. I think many consider this to be a Dixit killer. I don't really agree, since they are pretty different (one is co-op and the other is competitive). I also think it's worthwhile to own both. I say this because the dream cards are so much like Dixit cards, I've used them in a game of Dixit and it worked well. I'm not sure if you could used Dixit cards as dream cards for Mysterium, but it might work. For me, the main reason one doesn't replace the other is that I like Dixit with 6+ players. With Mysterium, I'd rather play this with 3 - 5 players maximum. Why? The more players you play with, the more people/places/things are on display, making it harder to win. It's also more choices in the Oneiromancy round. It's already hard enough to win as it is! In addition, and probably more importantly, the more people you include, the longer it will take for the Ghost player to distribute dream cards and the more likely you are of going through the deck of dream cards (or seeing them more often making the game less replayable).

Regardless of whether you use the Polish/Italian/Ukrainian editions of the game, if someone is stuck on a person/place/thing, it can become apparent by round 6, that there is no chance of being able to do the Oneiromancy round. I think this takes away from the narrative arc of the game and is a bit anticlimactic.

RATING: 5
A sort of cluedo-esque game played with dixit cards.

In this players are given dixit like cards 'dreams' which should help them to deduce weapon,location and suspect just as in cluedo, however just like dixit cards the artwork is quite surreal and just like interpreting real dreams, there can be a lot of ambiguity in what the 'dream' is actually pointing at.

If you head off in the wrong direction it can be difficult to get back on track as it were. Alternatively if you play well can correctly guess all three of your cards the you are sat for a while waiting for the other players to catch up, or possible offering suggestions as to what their cards could represent. 

There is a lot of downtime between turns as the ghost player needs to pick a card for each player from several in his/her hand. Unfortunatly it is this down time that kills this game for me, what should take around 20-30 minutes can stretch over 45 minutes or even an hour.

Nagyon érdekelt ez a dixit/nyomozós kombó, bár kicsit féltem tőle, hogy vajon mennyi van a játékban. Egy játék után azt kell, hogy mondjam, hogy nagyon sok. Nagyon jól működik a mechanika, ráadásul elég könnyen bele is lehet élni magad a helyzetbe, a különleges álmokba egy nyomozás során. A legjobb rész talán, mikor már a második esetleg harmadik álmot kapod ugyanarról a dologról, és megpróbálod megtalálni az összefüggést a látszólag összefüggéstelen lapok között. Nagyon jó ötlet még, hogy nem lehet megmutatni egymásnak a lapokat, hiszen az álmomat is csak elmondani tudom, és könnyen lehet, hogy pont a legfontosabb részletet nem mondom el véletlenül. Nagyon sok és hasznos a kommunikáció a játékosok között, hiszen rengeteget szűkít az is a lehetőségeken, ha ki tudjuk találni valaki másét.

Szuper jó játék, messze a várakozásokon felül teljesített. Rég éreztem ekkora kényszert a vásárlásra.

Coop Dixit. Give clues via pictures, A lot more interesting then Dixit. It's about giving clues with vague cards that have a lot of details in them ie a hammock between two trees is a clue it was the fisherman because it looks like a net ;) Always a fun game, the post descussion on why you gave me that stupid clue etc... is even better then the gameplay

RATING: 5
Beautifully illustrated cooperative card matching game, where you have very few clues from the spirit (one player plays this role) as to what card is the correct match.  The card might match because of the general color, the shape, or some obscure detail --it matches based on whatever reasoning the spirit player says it matches.  With a small hand to work from, some of the matches were a big stretch, throwing off the players.  The difficulty goes up dramatically with each added player, and we had too few guesses to win in our two 6 player games.  With each player, there are more incorrect matches to be eliminated.  The total number of cards in the game is also relatively low (we used the entire deck), meaning replay is dependent mostly on the players, not the available options.  Still, it's an interesting game.

Clever mix of Cluedo + Dixit becomes something much better than either one! First time I played it we couldn't stop, and ended up playing it a few more times afterwards. It created some very interesting conversations and interactions, and I loved it! This is exactly why I like boardgames so much.

Dixit csapatjáték turbó fokozatban
A Portal kiadó játékait az eddigi nagyon jó tapasztalatok alapján figyelemmel követem és általában be is szerzem. Mindezek mellett a Dixit az egyik kedvenc játékom. Itt találkozott a két dolog.
Bár a játék lengyel nyelven érhető el, senkit se rettentsen el, mert a szabálykönyv fordítása elérhető, a szabályok egyszerűek, a kártyák megértéséhez nem kell idegen nyelvek ismerete.
Játékosaink misztikum iránt érzékeny karaktereket alakítanak, akik egy ódon panzió/kúria/kastély maradványai között folytatják nyomozásukat, hogy közös erővel kiderítsék mi is történt a falak között a múltban. Ebben segítségükre van a játékosok egyike, aki az anno ártatlanul vádolt és a börtönben elhalálozott, a világunkban ragadt Szellemet alakítja a játék során. Kártyái segítségével álmok formájában (ez az egyetlen kommunikációs lehetősége) próbálja kisebb-nagyobb sikerrel rávezetni a többieket, hogy pontosan a gyilkosság időpontjában kik tartózkodtak ott, hol voltak és éppen mivel foglalkoztak; majd egy közös álom segítségével megmutatni a valódi tettest. Mivel kooperatív a játék, így a nyomozók és a Szellem együtt nyernek, vagy buknak el a küldetés során. Mivel a csillagok szerencsés együttállása csak rövid ideig segíti az itt ragadt entitást, hogy kommunikálhasson a külvilággal, összesen 7 napjuk van a játékosoknak, hogy a rejtély megoldására leljenek.
Mindebben az egyedi és gyönyörű álomkártyák és további lapok segítenek megteremteni a hangulatot, persze nem kevés fejtörést okozva a nyomozóknak. Ki, hogyan is tudja értelmezni a kapott információ morzsákat; de valójában mire is akart utalni a Szellem. Előre leszögezem, hogy neki van egyszerre a legnehezebb, egyben legvidámabb feladata. A megfelelő kártyákat átadni és utána rácsodálkozni, hogy a csapat mit is olvasott ki belőle. Látni és hallani, ahogyan a megoldás megvolt, de jól lebeszélték magukat róla. Látni, hogy milyen apró részleteket fed fel a csapat, amit szegény Szellem nem vett észre …
Remek a játék, eddig bárkivel próbáltuk ki, mindenkinek tetszett. A csapat összeszokottságának megfelelően be tudjuk állítani a nehézséget, könnyedebb és nagyobb kihívást jelentő feladatot állítva a résztvevőknek. Csak ajánlani tudom!

[ES] Que pasaria si Cluedo y Dixit tienen un hijo? Mysterium. Gran  party game de deducción e imaginación. En Mysterium un jugador hace de un fantasma que intenta transmitir información a los demás a través de cartas de "sueño" abstractas. Lo catalogaría como la versión muy mejorado del dixit: Mientras el dixit sufre a medida que te vas familiarizando con las cartas, el mysterium incentiva a buscar nuevos detalles en las cartas abstractas para intentar relacionarlos con el quien, con que y donde.

RATING: 7
Yera (en edicion española)
D.A (en edicion polaca "Tajemnicze Domostwo")

Es un juego de deducción, cooperativo, en el cual un jugador hace de "fantasma" y "revela pistas" (da a los jugadores cartas con ilustraciones, del estilo del dixit), para que estos determinen cada uno a su asesino, lugar y objeto con el que se cometió el crimen que se investiga según el argumento. Y finalmente determinar entre todos cual es el verdadero asesino. 

Sobre el papel la idea es muy buena. es algo asi como un "cluedo" pero sobre la base de la deducción con las cartas. El desarrollo es algo mas farragoso y en mi opinión el juego falla un poco en su parte central: el desarrollo del juego no casa con el argumento, con lo cual se queda un poco en un "quiero, pero no puedo". 

A pesar de ello, me gusta mas que dixit.

This is co-operative Dixit.
Card artwork & the 1920s theme are top notch!

The game plays well & is relatively easy, everyone plays a psychic investigator that gets hints (cards) from a ghost who's trying to convey who murdered him.

Kudos to the designer! I don't think there ever was a co-operative game where everyone was working towards the same goal but one had to silently help all the others (instead of the usual battling vs. a boring AI), where the theme fits that well. That alone knocks this game out of the park.. eastern european game designers definately seem to have the edge at the moment.

But: the one thing that bothers me, there seems to be no scaling at all.. the game is immensely easier with fewer players.. so if you wanna win, never play it with the maximum ammount of players.. that's very unfortunate. Otherwise this game would be an instant classic for me.

This is just as everyone else describes it--it's like a cooperative Dixit without the spoken element.

I played with the original art; I'm a little skeptical of the new version. (1 play)

Un veloce cooperativo che mescola Dixit a Cluedo. Colui che interpreta il fantasma deve far scoprire agli altri, in sogno, luogo, arma e identità di chi lo uccise. Il sogno lo decide con le carte, carte oniriche dai mille ambigui significati. Semplice ma poco rigiocabile, con le stesse persone.

We play using the Ukrainian rules, but with one house rule: When doing the "exposing the true culprit" part of the game, once down to two options (which is straight away, when we're just playing 3 players total), the psychics have to deduce the culprit in that round, i.e. there can be no "winning by default", merely by having rounds enough left to guess at every option.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (January 2015)

I had big hopes for Mysterium and, gladly, the game doesn’t disappoint. It takes the Dixit´s core mechanic (a game I love) and turns it into a great cooperative game with very simple rules. It can be explained under 10 minutes and the play time is under 1 hour.

The art is GREAT as are the player tokens (from the Italian edition). Love the theme. I think it is best as a 4 player game, with more players the ghost player can make mistakes AND the game begins to drag with lots of downtime. I feel the ghost player has the most fun, but the game is very fun overall. 

So far I don’t have any complaint about the game, It is hard to beat but I like that. Perhaps the game came with very few cards (has a low replay value), so if you play often some patterns will emerge (same clues for same suspect/place/object) but that can be easily solved using Dixit cards.

Bottom line, I really like Mysterium and I can’t wait to play it again. It has a lot of potential to go up in my personal ratings. For me it isn’t a party game because some cards are really hard to figure, it is more of a brain burner.

I have been playing lots of Mysterium and I still think it is a very good game, however my desire to play it has diminished a bit, so I’m downgrading its rating. Now when someone asks me if I want to play Mysterium I say yes, but there are an increasing number of games I would play over Mysterium.

I have changed my mind again :D, last time I played the game it was fabulous, so it seems Mysterium is very group dependent, but I almost always want to play it so I’m upgrading its rating again.

I initially doubted this game. I did the same with Dixit. How wrong I was with them both! Mysterium plays in the right amount of time and has a captivating story. I really enjoy the deduction and social element. The only issue I foresee is a lack of replayability since each the suspect, location, and weapon cards can get a little repetitive. Once you get an accepted idea for who a person is regarding the suspects, giving and interpreting clues gets a whole lot easier.

Clue meets Dixit with a spiritual theme.  This was a 4 play at one sitting because it was a scarce game to find.  Each one of our players had to be the spirit and it was amazing listening to how the other players thought I was trying to convey my message.  Great for 4-5, but I could see where this could be very difficult with more players.

I was originally interested in this game after reading Faidutti's summary of his Rencontres Ludopathiques. But unfortunately I'm not a big fan of the cooperative nature of the game. The frustration you feel as the clue giver can be fun, when you hear the players consider and then discard your clues.

But ultimately it doesn't feel like too much of a game. It feels very solitaire and is very quiet, lacking excitement or drama.

I hate Dixit but I love this game. It takes the pretty and intriguing aspects of Dixit and sort of mashes them up with Clue, which was frankly one of my favorites in childhood. It does this in a way that rewards even serious players with a lot of fun. It requires a little bit of "know your judge" aka ghost, but not so much that it's un-fun with a group of strangers. Really glad I was encouraged by some new friends to try this game, and glad Portal made copies available for ordering/shipment from Poland.

We played it five times the first evening. The only game which caught us that much was Chez Geek, but for completely different reasons. Here everybody wanted to be a ghost, moreover the game is not that long. But this is not its greatest advantage. It joined the best properties of Dixit and Cluedo. A ghost gives clues using the cards, other players have to guess which person, place and tool (of murder) the ghost is trying to show to each of them. The cards are pretty varied and detailed, so the ghost has the hardest task to give precise and not misleading clues. Especially if there are no suitable cards among the ones held in hand. On the other hand, other players are also kept busy. It is quite hard to decipher the ghost's clues. It is important to keep in mind that ghost has a limited card choice.

Pirmą vakarą sužaidėme penkis kartus. Taip buvo užkabinęs tik Chez Geek, bet visiškai dėl kitų priežasčių. Čia visi norėjo pabūti vaiduokliu, kita vertus, žaidimas nėra ilgas. Bet tai nėra jo didžiausi privalumai. Tai Dixit ir Cluedo žaidimų hibridas, sujungęs jų geriausias savybes. Vaiduoklis kortelėmis perduoda užuominas, o žaidėjai turi atspėti, kokį veikėją, vietą ir (žmogžudystės) įrankį kiekvienam nurodo vaiduoklis. Kortelės gana įvairios ir margos, taigi vaiduokliui tenka sunkiausia užduotis duoti tikslias užuominas ir nenuvesti žaidėjų klystkeliais. Ypač kai tarp kortelių nelabai yra tinkamų užuominoms. Kita vertus ir žaidėjai nesėdi be darbo. Iššifruoti vaiduoklio užuominas nemenkas uždavinys. Svarbu nepamiršti, kad vaiduoklio pasirinkimas pakankamai ribotas.

Beautiful artwork. The locations look like something out of a hidden object game and the dream cards are a profusion of Dixitesque visions. Two things mainly prevented me from having a nice Dixitesque experience. First, the time needed by investigators to make a guess was short compared to the time needed by the spirit to produce hints, so that most of the game was spent simply waiting. Second, when it was clear that one of the investigators would not be able to catch up in time, it seemed to render a good deal of what we had done further up the chain of evidence inconsequential. Looking at the rules afterwards I can see we played a few things incorrectly: the spirit was allowed a free redraw each turn, even though we were ostensibly playing on difficult; the spirit did not have to add a minimum of one dream card per turn and player; and also the spirit got to place dream cards in specific alignments and even cover up cards with facedown cards in order to frame specific elements, which doesn't quite seem to be in the spirit of the game. Guess it serves us right that we lost. I wouldn't mind giving it another try since playing with the proper restrictions should speed up the dream phase, but I don't really see a lot of replayability here.

Very fun game. I like the aspect of searching for the associations the ghost has had (or creating those when being the ghost myself). The only problem I see for now that playing with the same people at one point you already know for some cards how they are meant (meaning, this card was once played to show something, so the next time my first assumption again is that is shows the same something). For now that isn't a big problem, but it might become one. Expansions needed. :)

Let's start with the obvious... the components are just incredible, the dream cards are oneiric and sometimes you just look at them and admire them. The gameplay is very easy, there are many difficulty levels for new players and for those who want this game to be harder. One player is the ghost the others try to guess the dreams, once you've tried to be the ghost you usually want to be him/her all the time :) but playing as the detective is also fun. Great cooperation game for families and geeks because the dreams are not always as obvious as they look...

A lovely exercise in frustrated, constrained communication, giving a great sense of trying to unpick an obscure vision that you know must make sense somehow. Some of the same revelation and humour as a good cryptic crossword, and even a disastrously mistaken game ending comes across like a satisfying Keyser Soze reveal. Not sure how well it'd stand up to repeated play with the same group, though, with easy callback shortcuts to previous games.

12-01-2014 - Demoed at BGG.CON.  For the uninitiated, this one is very similar to Dixit.

As I mulled it over, I saw all the ways it is very different from Dixit and yes, I needed this in my collection.  I went to the booth at BGG to buy it... and it was sold out.  Hot dang!  So I'm Mysterium-less and look forward to buying it as soon as I can.  Great game.  Solid 9.

RATING: 8
Polish version with the fantastic art.  Bought some colored crystal balls and made a ghost player screen to add some chrome to the game.

A good solid game but seems to be very much group dependent.  If the investigators are paying attention to the patterns of the clues being made or to the elements of the clue cards, then the game can be very entertaining for all players involved.  Some games do seem futile as a ghost when you continuously draw dream cards that won't help the investigators.

If not taken too seriously, the game is casual enough to play from time to time.  But wouldn't play too often due to the repeat nature of seeing the same cards.  Hopeful for another expansion with more who, what, and where cards.

RATING: 7
Polish version.  Have doubts about the replayability of this if you play with the same game group.  We played and then used the cards for Dixit.

Second play was just as fun, so I think the replayability is there.

Mysterium is a purely co-operative game for 2-7 players. One player takes the role of a helpful ghost who lives in a mysterious ancient manor. Other players are a group of psychics invited by the manor owner to solve the mystery of the place and bring peace to its residents, as any person who stays in the castle sees strange dreams.

The ancient legend says the ghost is the soul of the manor's previous resident, who was unjustly executed for a crime he didn't commit, more than 100 years ago. Now he tries to use the mysterious signs to tell people the truth about what really happened then, so that justice would be established and he might rest in peace for ever. The specialists in the supernatural were invited to try to understand what the ghost wants to tell and in case of success be honoured by one more victory and receive a generous reward. They have 7 days and 7 nights to reach their goal. If they succeed in time, everyone wins the game (including the ghost).

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Assuming we go the rules right, I think playing seven player is downright challenging and not recommended at first. With the ghost trying to distribute clues via cards that allegedly make some connection with either a weapon, location, or person the wavelengths will frequently not connect and cause a fair bit of confusion, mayhem, and hopefully laughter. I find the concept interesting but feel the game needs a bit more fine tuning in perhaps giving the ghost x+2 cards with x being the number of players?

I am about as big of a Portal fanboy as you'll ever see. Ignacy is one of the few boardgame designers/publishers I follow on Twitter. Yet Mysterium was a game I wasn't too stoked about. I'm not a huge fan of Dixit or storytelling stuff or things like that, so nothing about it made me eager to try it out, even as people around me reported back great things. I finally got to try it and I have to admit, I liked it more than I thought I would. It does some pretty interesting things. It's not something I want to play regularly, and it's nothing I need to have on my shelf, but it wasn't what I was fearing.

Mysterium used to be a lot higher for me. But for some reason, other games just kept beating it out for me. I'm not sure if it's because Mysterium has lost some of its sparkle for me or that other things are just more enjoyable, but Mysterium was barely edged out of my Top 50 recently. I think it's partially because a stubborn investigator can definitely break a game but never getting things right just like a complete mind meldy player can break it by getting everything right and there being no real tension. The tension of being able to solve the murder is really what makes this game so amazing.

My favorite role is hands down the Ghost. I love adapting to how other players are interpreting the clues I send them and trying to fit my clues to the way that they think.

Dixit cards have found another use.
Seriously, this game seems made by the same people of Dixit as some of the "dream" card resemble those lovely puzzling drawings found on Dixit cards.
Artistically is gorgeous, but playwise... a bit meh. Can be fun for a bit, but it's good only when you don't play it with the same people as there's not so much randomness and it will become easier and easier over time.

RATING: 7.5
Christmas present for Teri 2014. An excellent Cleudo/Dixit hybrid. It is a lot more fun to play as the ghost, but either way if you are with good people the game is fun.

This game is more of an activity of seeing what people see in common between two completely different things. It makes me laugh so much on either side, but as the ghost it is maddening to put something down you see as obvious and then have everyone else connect it with something completely different. Also: needs to be played swiftly, ghost AP makes for a rubbish game.

Having only played this with my boyfriend, I can say that this is probably not an ideal game for a couple.  Firstly, it's quite likely to provoke tension, and not the good kind of tension; secondly, both of us found it an uncomfortable combination of frustrating and dull ... and also just a bit silly. People merrily say that Mysterium is like Clue mixed with Dixit. That is the fatuous Pollyanna definition. I say that Mysterium is like Clue on a really bad acid trip.

PLayed this at BGG con 2014 with 4. I want this game! It's Dixit and Clue mashed together! 

Update 1/1/15: After 5 more plays, this game got even better. Being the ghost is pretty brutal, and while I would encourage you to give everyone a chance to be it, many (perhaps most) will probably not excel in that role. Is that a weakness of the game? I don't think so. I think it just means there is more to explore and learn from. This game definitely gets better with more plays.

RATING: 9.5
Each game is different since a different mix of what, where, who cards come out as well as different dream cards.  Matching clues to cards requires some knowledge of how the ghost thinks, so changing the ghost player from play to play keeps the game fresh too.  The rules are extremely simple so it's a low complexity game, but there's a whole lot of thinking involved in working together to decipher the clues.  The low complexity makes it a perfect game to bring in non-gamers, while gamers will still have fun with the unique experience and the cooperation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As most have noted, its a mash-up of Dixit and Clue. More of a shared activity than a game, but wonderful interactions; almost requires more than 2 or 3 to meet its full potential. The journey of interpreting the dreams is the fun, the ending seems flat whether they succeed or fail. But the discussions and guessing are very entertaining and worthwhile.

If you suffer from co-op boss syndrome make the bossy person be the ghost.

Played less than 10 times. Interactive. Creative. You often feel like "High Five"ing each other. Playing the ghost can be a brain burner if you don't want to give too much downtime to the other players. This game could be hard with people you don't know at least a little.

Interresting thing : even if the ghost/player interaction is prohibited (beside sending dreams cards), the ghost can and should use the other players interactions as a guide for sending dreams. 

Definitely a new staple in my collection. Might raise the rating to 10 after some more games.

Tanács 1: Este, kevés fénynél, nyikorgó ajtóknál érdemes játszani vele, hogy a hangulat jobban átjöjjön.

Tanács 2: Ha a szellem sokat tököl, elveszi a játékosok kedvét/lendületét, így érdemes olyan játékosnak "szellemkednie", aki már legalább párat játszott nyomozóként is.

Tanács 3: Ha a Dixit nem tetszett, attól ez még lehet, hogy fog...

Kártyák gyönyörűek, szabályok rövidek, úgyhogy kezdőknek is ajánlott.

A nice [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit]Dixit[/url]-ish asyimmetrical co-op.
The ghost is limited in her 7 cards, while the players must try to think like she does (does she thinks about movies, celebrities, rock music, cooking...).
So a good game for a fixed group of friends (you'll know what to expect from the others).

The very good point here is the atmosphere: quite unique, dreamy and really catchy. The material quality (italian version) is exceptional; there is a strange untranslated time marker still in french (why?!) but that somewhat adds to the pensive experience.

I own the Italian edition and it is a joy to behold. The gameplay is every bit as awesome as the artwork. Everyone I've played this with has enjoyed it (although a 12 girl thought some the artwork was a bit gloomy).

This is one of those games like 7 Wonders where I find myself saying this is such a clever idea for a game that I wish I had thought of it.

I really hope expansions with many more cards are in the works to keep things from becoming too familiar.

Not a bad game, but could get a little repetetive. The gameplay is dependent on whether the Ghost player 'knows' you and your way of thinking well. If you like Dixit, you will like this one too, but this is just not the type of game I'd like to play over and over.

I absolutely enjoy the game ever since the very first round. It's amazing yet hilarious when people try to guess the hidden meaning behind all those images. The replayability is huge, and it doesn't get old as peiple have different perspectives and how they hinder the messages through pictures.

The only catch is that the cards are quite thin, so they may be torned apart easily. In case the water gets in, those card can't be saved :'(

Nice cards, nice components.

Due to the high number of cards used, you quickly start recognizing some of them however, which takes away some of the magic.

In this cooperative game, one player takes on the role of spirit, and everyone else is an investigator, trying to free the spirit. The spirit gives a clue, which is a card,similar to Dixit, but there is no singing or verbal communication allowed. Each investigator has to guess an item, location and character associated with them. Once everyone has guessed all three things correctly, they proceed to guess the culprit. 

It's a fun social game, and it even supports 7 players.

Kind of a novel and magical experience, especially on a first play, as there is no game quite like it. No, not even Dixit, as Mysterium is purely imagistic -- the ghost doesn't speak. Also a potentially bonding experience, as you are encouraged to understand how your friends think, whether emotionally or not, and you yourself share your process of abstract thought. Too bad there isn't an endless supply of cards -- you can go through so many in a game, and seeing the same dream on a subsequent play does take something away. We played with card holders from 10 Days in Europe; without some kind of holder the ghost's job would inch closer to chore from fun. Mysterium has the potential to appeal, on a mass level, to a general audience.

Evoluzione di Dixit, simpatica e carina come idea, le partite però sono molto in mano del fantasma che potrebbe trasformarle in grande successo o in grande insuccesso.
Gioco che può funzionare ma che si presta a scarsa longevità specie se giocato sempre con lo stesso gruppo.

RATING: 7.5
Less a game than an elaborately-contrived piece of performance art. I think it's trying to be a "gamers' Dixit", but the setup and fiddling around almost put paid to that. The denouement is anti-climactic.

The potential for silly in-jokes and meta-gaming mean I will probably play it several more times under a mild duress.

[b]Incredibly frustrating for colourblind players[/b]. I have played three times now, and find the game very difficult. Other players have found it challenging (best) or frustrating (worst) attempting to cater for my colourblindness. Splitting the card sets is not the issue: there are simply too many instances where the ghost may want to incorporate colour in their clues. [u]This has been a problem in each game[/u]. There is no obvious way to fix this. Not unplayable, but very close; and not much fun. Avoid. More generally - Dixit with a layer of deduction. Mysterium seems to be very dependent on the players - even more so than Dixit.

RATING: 9
Paulo hates, hates, hates Dixit. His favorite games are 4x and very heavy on strategy (Terra Mystica, Eclipse, etc.,). And yet he loves this game. Mysterium is half Clue, half Dixit, a cooperative deduction game that's built around surreal and beautiful artwork. What the game excels at is debate, cooperation and social engagement to solve the puzzle. I tend to think The Perfect Game has virtually no "down time," when players are no longer engaged with the game (Catan comes to mind as being the epitome of destroying boredom). And Mysterium also has this in spades. If you want a nonconformist, asymmetrical experience rather than fighting about who gets to be the car in Monopoly or canceling each other's answers in Scattergories, I recommend Mysterium.

RATING: 6
Good idea, despite being a cooperative game. I like the blend of Cluedo and Dixit plus the theme of a ghost communicating with psychics via abstract dreams. However, would rather play a straight game of Dixit as it is more competitive and with less downtime.

RATING: 7
Interesting but without being fun per se, being a constant analysis of how the spirit player might be trying to link two pictures together; and when you can see multiple possible links, taking a punt at which is the most likely. After a few games you get to see the same cards again, and remembered analyses of previous cards come into play creating a meta game of link patterns. Which can only be advantageous to the players, but it seems like a creation of "cheats" which circumvents the point of play, so I'm not sure how much replay the game's going to have within a same group of players. At the least it creates a nice social experience of shared discussion and contemplation which gives it a different feel from other games in my collection so it'll probably find a permanent spot.

Very good game, it's really fun to try to connect things like hammer or frying pan, with cards from the dream deck, which are very surreal. Works well with 2 to 7 players, but it's best with 3, 4 or 5 in my opinion.

RATING: 6
Mysterium is a cooperative deduction game that combines the mechanics of Dixit and the theme of Clue. One player takes on the role of the “ghost”, who distributes cards with surreal images (“dreams”) from his hand to the other players, who are trying to guess which murder weapon/location/culprit they refer to. Oddly, each player has their own combination of weapon/location/culprit, so once a player guesses correctly for one of them, it is eliminated for the other players. If players guess incorrectly, the ghost player (who must remain silent) can build around their logic to inform his next attempt. This game really feels like it’s in the same vein as Dixit, and might be a bit more interesting, but it’s not really my sort of thing.

Tried the easy mode with 2p. I really liked it, we didn't manage a win (I did get all the combinations, but picked the wrong culprit in the final round). Very curious how this plays with more players. 

This is really good with more than 2. Played 4p only, but the talking about what the hints mean and trying to help eachother pick really adds to the game.

If you like coop games, this game is great! A lot of coop games have a very similar mechanic (e.g. pandemic and forbidden island), but having one team member trying to give you clues with different painting cards about who was where with what (e.g. in clue it would be Scarlet in the kitchen with the revolver) makes this game fun and different. Challenging and different enough for serious gamers but simple and approachable enough that you can get non-gamers to play and enjoy it too.

Dixit with a Clue theme. Pretty cool.

One player is the ghost of a murdered person, and points the others towards his murderer. But he only speaks in visions (Dixit-like cards).

So as a player you get maybe a yellow spiky critter on a toadstool, a knight at a tower and a bath tub floating in the ocean, and you have to figure out if that points to the magician, or maybe the barber, or possibly the soldier. Sometimes there's more info in cards you didn't get than in those you did. Work together to figure out how the ghost thinks. Is that a reference to a movie, or are the colors of the cards a hint?

Hogy miért van ekkor hype ekörül a játék körül, nem értem.
Egy Dixitbe oltott Cluedo agyonöntve egy gyilkosság mázzal meg szellemekkel. 
Adott egy "elbeszélő", maga a szellem, aki segít kinyomozni a többieknek, hogy hol történt a gyilkosság, mivel hajtották végre és persze, hogy ki követte el?
Hasonlóan a Dixithez, itt is hat lapból választ a mesélő, csak 1. sokkal gyengébb képek vannak a kártyákon 2. nem szólhat egy szót sem
Így abszolút lutri az egész.
Ráadásul a Dixitet szinte mindenki szereti, mert egy igazán jó party játék, ahol ahogy mondtam festményszerűen furcsa, de mégis gyönyörű képek vannak, ahol lehet nevetni, mert olyan megjegyzéseket lehet mondani, ami elgondolkodtató vagy akár vicces. Na itt ilyen nincs, csak tippelgetés. 
Nem jó játék.

This is a really fantastic co-op game. One player is the ghost, and the other players are the investigators. The game lays out an array of items, locations and people. Then some of those are selected secretly, so that each player has one correct item, location and then person they have to guess out of the array of cards. The ghost then tries to hint players into discovering their cards through playing "dream cards" that are abstract creepy pictures. The Ghost can't talk or hint in any way outside of assigning cards to players each round. The players have 7 rounds to guess. Both games we played, we lost, mid game because we ran out of rounds with which to guess the remaining cards. I think some of this was my fault as the ghost, because often times I would have a lot of trouble matching what was in my hand to what I needed the players to guess. The ghost player also has a lot to consider. Perhaps I see something in one of the pictures I think matches the item I want the player to guess. I need to make sure the dream doesn't have something in it that also matches to a different item more obviously AND I need to make sure I save cards in my hand that will point towards future things I need them to guess.

Construct a city and try to own the most valuable properties while also having the most cubes in each row of the city grid. Very harsh, game routinely helps the player in the lead, which normally I hate in a game, but for some reason it works here to the game's advantage, as players scramble to stay out of last place. A lot of city builder games try to do what this game does, and don't do it even half as well. One of the amazing things about this game is that the player who winds up with the Mayoral role, has to hand out special and powerful effect cards to the other players.

The game does flow a lot better with a simple spreadsheet showing what the current values of each row are, so that you can quickly at a glance discern which spot on the grid is most and least valuable, as this is frequently used by the game's effects to either help or punish a player.

An excellent game with cross generational appeal and simple rules. The setup is a bit complex (unavoidable), the actual rules to the american version are kind of stupid, IMO, and there are an unneccesary amount of pieces, which can intimidate new players. I play the bare bones- everyone solves their own murder and we win game version, and this I whole-hardheartedly recommend.

Hey, this is neat! It's a co-op deduction game, but where one player is the clue-giver ('ghost') and the others are the clue-interpreters, and the clues are all given using Dixit-style artwork cards (and no words), which can be discussed by the detectives. Genuine whoops of excitement when we figured out a subtle clue. I want to try being the ghost!

RATING: 6.5
I dont like how there is downtime for the investigators when the ghost is trying to find any card that is related to the item/place/person. But once the ghost starts giving a dream, the chatter will start and it is funny. Not up to my expectations though in the final stage aka common dream, maybe the English edition will have better rules which make the gameplay feels more thematic.

Very thoughtful, in a strange way. You can spend a lot of time analyzing a clue, and knowing that you are probably overanalyzing it, only to find out later that the ghost was just trying to get rid of a card or just wanted you to see the basic color or shapes of the card. The "what did he mean by this?" mechanic feels very unique. It also feels a bit too loose sometimes, when you look at the clue and think "This could refer to four of these options" and you have no way to narrow it down other than guessing. You don't get many failed guesses before you lose the game, so it can be frustrating.

There is a lot of downtime in this game, as the ghost has to take a while to choose good cards while everyone else waits, and then the group discusses the clues for a while.

The game is vaguely like co-op Cluedo meets Dixit, where abstract art is given to you by the ghost player, to help you figure out who did not do the murderm and then sort out who did. With six detectives, it was a struggle for all but two of us to exclude the persons, places and things. 

Like with Dixit (with whom this game shares an artist) I more enjoy the rather peaceful card art than the game proper. Maybe I'm just in a sour mood though. I mean, I absolutely am, but I don't know if my bad mood is reflecting onto or from the games today.

Hands down, one of the worst games I've ever played. Nothing here makes sense and the game doesn't know what it wants to be. All it tries to do, is to wrap up some very poorly thematically justified mechanic around giving clues about certain items or persons with ambigous cards with dixit-like graphics. Here, obviously, you're forced to give very particular clues, so chances are, you cards will be rubbish and there's simply no way to make a viable connection. So you can discard and draw new hand, but the game tries to be smart and limit that per game, because "you should be creative".

Story: you figure out few people in mansion, where they were and what items did they use. It isn't exactly sure if these are all murderers and all items are murder weapons, or they just signify activity. Now, the best part - as soon as you guess all the persons and items and locations, locations and items are simply removed from the game and they don't matter AT ALL. Talk about tying mechanic with theme. It's a laughingstock. But it get's better. So in the end, only persons stay and you get hints about the actual murderer. There's limited game round time, but if you're smart enough, you don't even have to guess, you can just use the other rounds to pick the other person, until you're right. GAAAAA. Stay away, stay away, stay away! Don't let the cool pictures fool you. There's no game here at all. 

2 for very cool artwork on some cards.

For the reference, I like RPG, Dixit, Winter Tales and other storytelling/narrative games. This isn't one.

An interesting co-operative game. One player gives clues to the others using picture cards. The other players must use these to guess three successive elements, a person, place, and weapon. Then with one final play the single player, the 'ghost', has to tell the others which of them is holding the winning hand.
I can see this being very enjoyable with the right group of players - and it would be an interesting co-operative to see in a competitive scenario. Sharp players will quickly identify the flaws in the victory conditions and regular play would definitely break it.

This is a fairly decent game. I'm not a fan of Dixit, at all, but this is a better way of presenting that kind of game. 

The key to this game is the playerbase. The non-ghost players must speak to each other and explain their reasoning, this helps the "ghost" to understand how they think so he can send better "dreams" to their characters to signify what he is trying to show them.

It can be a little frustrating at times and this kind of game isn't for everyone. It will be a very poor experience if you are playing with the wrong kind of player too. 

A decent game I'd consider that could be fun at times.

A cooperative game that can't be dominated by a single player as each person can chime in as to what the dream cards mean.  Fun and challenging to play the ghost as well giving the clues.  As a group continues to play, there will naturally develop tropes for clues that that the group will get, but easy enough to ramp up the difficulty by adding more cards at each "level".

The sort of game that demands a replay after the first game.  And part of the fun is discussing what was intended by the clues vs. what was actually perceived.

4 is the minimum I would play the game with as I think the additional choices (especially for the final reveal) are necessary to add to the challenge of the game.

bizarre and amazing. using surreal images for limited coop communication is brilliant.

update:  It's definitely awesome, but the card draws can sometimes make the game feel a bit random or unsatisfying.  The core mechanic is brilliant, but I think it may be been handled better in Deception, which came later.  On the other hand, Mysterium works better in small groups and for a more pleasing total coop, so I may well keep both.

31-08-2015. Rated after 1 play. Many people call it Dixit meets clue(do).

In this cooperative game, one player is a ghost giving hints by using 'Dixit'-like cards.  The other players try to figure out which 'combination' of murder weapon, suspect and location are the location of a murder. The ghost tries to communicate by 'clueing' Dixit cards together and giving that to players and have them 'associate' the which clues go together. Together, the players want to solve the murder.

I think the game is fine. I like the mechanisms and I think the game does a pretty good job. It's novel, it's interesting and importantly, different from other cooperative games. I did notice a strong tendency for  quarterbacking and groupthink. I dislike that, highly. But I guess you'll just have to sort the people you play games with first. All in all, it's a fine game I'd play again.. that said, I am not sure how replayability is if players are able 'learn' the associations.

very accessible Narrative Co-op

lovely mood-evoking more complicated co-op version of Dixit. Speaking of mood-evoking, if the ghost player never actually speaks (AT ALL) for the whole game, the mood is enhanced. We play the Ukranian rules (7 cards in hand, ghost chooses killer from successfully picked, etc).

I don't understand those who say the narrative is broken through the final round sequence--as I describe it to new players, the ghost sets the scene of 100 years ago, sending each player the who, how and where of a definite plan to kill the murder victim--i.e. each of the players' sets of cards were potential murders...once the scene has been described and the investigators know all of those who planned to murder the deceased, the ghost is able to communicate more--the person who actually succeeded in their plan to murder. How is that disjointed? Oneiromancy isn't like dictating a letter to someone, things come when they can be understood, after scene setting. Just ask Jung! Just pointing straight to the murderer would also make for a poor game as well as a poor narrative.

Wish my wife liked it more. Plays well with 2, or at least I think so. She finds it stressful. 

Edit - too stressful. get rid of.

For trade- VG cond, box signed by designers, played once.

Best not overplayed, but a great atmospheric experience although sometimes it seems akin to sitting around a Ouija board trying to conjure up nonsense. One of the few co-ops I like, although the mechanism creaks a bit, logically, here and there. Beautiful card art in the original edition.

BGG user bertinc captures my major criticism of this game: "The problem I have with it is that the hint cards are just so busy. The artwork is great, but it is difficult to come up with useful hints.... In the end, if the ghost doesn't have any cards that help create meaningful hints, all the work of getting there feels completely worthless. "

A nice blending of Dixit and Cluedo. The role of the ghost is a tough one when trying to keep the game moving along, but the frustration of listening to circular debates when the investigators debate the dream meanings offers a perverse thrill.

The game can drag for investigators struggling to decipher multiple rounds of clues on a single card which can lead to the game being unsatisfactorily called when insufficient time remains to bother with finishing the game.

Pick Dixit, then take away the scoring and the part which is like Apples to Apples - you might think there's almost nothing left. Yet Mysterium takes this (in the shape of imaginative surrealist cards) and adds even more cards (these more impressionistic showing people places and objects) and what you get is a sort of marriage of Dixit and Cluedo which plays kinda like Hanabi. 

It's somewhere between a co-op and a party game - one person is giving hints (with "dixit" cards) other are guessing information on their suspect. Who it is, where did he/she kill and with what. It's really interesting how it's a cooperative game, yet roles are distinct. There's a clue giver which is against other players, yet on their side. And they give hints to each player individually (each has individual goals), yet all players but the clue giver can discuss hints amongst themselves. A really interesting group dynamics - the more people talk the more the clue giver ("ghost") knows what to give them in the next round.

Another interesting notion is how the surreal cards open up in this setting. In Dixit they become puzzles and in-the-know jokes. But here, they are dreams, they are communicating to you directly. But you're not sure what exactly. You are stumbling through their landscapes and then you wake up, in sweat, and then everybody screams at you what your dreams mean (are you stupid or something?). .

Would love to play more and with different groups to get more insight. But: very impressed.

A leírásom az eredeti lengyel kiadásról szól. A játékosok egy-egy bűntettet próbálnak megoldani egy mesélő segítségével, aki Dixit szerű kártyákkal próbálja sugallni a kitalálók felé a helyes tárgy, majd a helyes helyszín és végül a helyes elkövető személyét. A játék könnyedebb, gördülékenyebb, mint a Dixit, mind a mesélő, mind a kitalálók szerepe érdekes és élvezetes. Pont kellően nehéz, de még nehezíthető. A Dixit nálam fő hibája itt nem jelenik meg, azaz a párok nem élveznek akkora előnyt. Abszolút tetszett, nagyon erős hetes az első osztályzat, ha más játékosszámmal is ki tudom próbálni nőhet még a pontszám. Nekem jobban bejött, mint a Dixit.

I'm repeating what others have said before, but "a cross between [thing=1294]Clue[/thing] and [thing=39856]Dixit[/thing]" is the perfect way to describe this game.

Neat idea. The ghost player can be prone to a lot of frustration for not having any cards that serve as effective clues.

After two plays and being taught the game by two different people, I still was not convinced. Then I bought my own copy, read the rules - and this game is a keeper. Originally I have not been a fan of co-op games but I am starting to warm up to the genre. Bonus feature - I can use my full collection of Dixit cards as dreams, or the Mysterium dreams cards as story cards in Dixit.

It's a cooperative form of Dixit that meets Clue. I really like the originality in this one - you have a spirit that is basically handing out some crazy art cards to the group and then the group has to examine those cards and decide where they were going with the cards they assigned you, all in an effort to get to a point where you've identified the ultimate murderer. All of this makes for an entertaining and engaging co-op; unfortunately, with my group, it takes a bit long to play.

Playing with the original Ukranian rules (but only 1 chance on the common dream, because our gaming group wants challenge).

I must say, I really liked the game when I saw it and was expecting a lot from it, but what I got overshadowed my expectations. This is an awesome game with simple rules and yet great replayability. Do we focus on the details on the clues or the overall pictures? The game is well balanced considering the pictures, there are lots of commonalities so ghost isn't really frustrated about giving clues and players can base their guesses on these commonalities. After like 10 plays our gaming group loves this game. That being said, each game we had was completely different. And we found out that the actual gameplay is so intense and interesting, that we didn't even care much who was the murderer (which makes us really crappy investigators, because law is interested in the culprit, not the whole story).

Also love the artwork on the Portal games version. Not to mention with those minimalistic components it's really quick to set up and highly portable if you put it in a smaller box.

Love this game.

RATING: 8
I was very pleasantly surprised by this game.  This is essentially Clue combined with Dixit.  I'm not the hugest fan of deduction games and Dixit just seemed way too dependent on the people you played with to be a staple for me.

In this game one player is playing a murdered ghost.  Everyone else is a psychic who the ghost communicates with in dreams.  In the center of the table are a set of people, locations, and murder weapons (a la Clue).  Each player matches with a set of these and there are more than there are players so some won't be used.  The players have 6 rounds to get each one, the ghost has a set of Dixit-like cards that they use to give clues to the players which cards are theirs.

This makes it very interesting and a little less dependent on individual whims than pure Dixit.  Sometimes the ghosts cards may not be the best but you still need to try your best to decipher why they gave you this particular card.  It is a cooperative affair so you can enlist help from your fellow psychics and it becomes a really interesting brain-burner.

At the end of the game each player will have a set of these murder details but only one of them is the true one so the ghost will give one more set of 3 clues (one for each of the weapon, suspect, and location) for the players to match to the true scene of the murder.

I really felt fulfilled by this game.  It was fun, academic, and very social.  My first play we failed horribly due to the ghost giving away a clue to another player that matched a specific location which was not his perfectly so we interpreted this as being no way that location was even used.  In reality it was just a mistake and this threw us way off.  But we still had a lot of fun talking about it afterward and how frustrated the ghost was at hearing us say "now we know nobody has this location" and being unable to speak.

So simple, great party fare, and very, very fulfilling.  This is a great game.

Mysterious fun, it's truly cooperative rather than a shared solo exercise. Clue meets Dixit is a good shorthand, but it's so much more; a real, shared and immersive experience.

I have the Polish version which is superior to the American one in a few ways. It doesn't have the extra bits that try to make this truly cooperative game more competitive. The new art is darker and desaturated, making it harder to give clues by color. The best thing about the American version is the great screen.

Mysterium has 1-6 players as psychic investigators trying to infer, from dream imagery sent to them by a ghost (another player), the who-what-where factors of a murder.

Essentially this is done by laying out sets of cards showing possible suspects/locations/weapons, while the ghost distributes abstract, Dixit-style images (hopefully) evocative of the subject. But the ghost has to hint with the cards they draw and all are ambiguous -- it's much harder than it sounds for all involved.

Where Dixit took weird pictures and storytelling and uses it in the old "players make up stuff and someone votes" party game formula, Mysterium hones the same elements into a razor-sharp deduction experience. It's brilliant, thematic, and fantastically enjoyable.

This must be the golden age of deduction games.

Let's get something out of the way: this is co-operative Dixit with a dungeon master. Having said that, I must say I did like the tension and the atmosphere in my 1 play of it (make sure you have a group that likes making jokes), but I do not see the replay-ability when the novelty is gone: in only 1 game (6 players), clue cards started reappearing already.

There are two different Mysterium rulesets:

Polish rules:
- Ghost has 6 card hand
- Ghost gives 1-3 cards per player, draws back to 6 each time
- Final mystery: all people are laid out, ghost gives a certain number of clues, shows what they didn't give, people guess the person.

Ukrainian rules:
- Ghost has 7 card hand
- Ghost gives any number of cards per player, draws back to 7 each time
- Final mystery: all players present their person/place/thing combination, ghost lays out 3 clues, players guess with set of 3 is correct.

I tried the English version once and didn't like it. It had some weird competitive and betting elements that doesn't make sense to me thematically and I feel those elements just detract from the whole experience of the investigators figuring out the ghost's message. The english version does have some sweet production value though.

I much prefer this version of Mysterium. The rules are elegant and simple enough I can explain and off we go. The ambiguity of the original rules means with some creative maneuvering, we can tailor the rules to fit, as evident on the variants page and all the different variant rules available.

It's a nice co-operative picture deduction game that plays up to 7.

Would be nice to have a player screen for the ghost, might think about custom making one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Social, collaborative game where one player plays the "ghost" and is only capable of communicating through cards, and everyone else (the psychics) tries to solve a murder. While it can be a fun game with the right team, it's a *maddening* game with the wrong one. ("This card includes a chimney sweep! It's a symbol of the futility of work, and the pettiness of life! It must refer to this man, who looks like he is an artist, a type of person who truly understands the difficulty of life..." No, maybe the ghost shared it because it has clouds it in, and another card does, too?)

If you have a bunch of people who work well together, it's not too bad. But I never enjoy playing it with strangers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An enjoyable deduction game. I love the art. It is super hard playing as the ghost. You want to scream, but all you can do is sit there with a poker face, and try to find some way of communicating through the next dream. Excellent thematic mechanism. However, I've come to find the deduction a little tame - I think I like it best when I get to be the ghost. The normal end game sort of falls flat, so we're using Rahdo's variant.

Dixit felt like a clever idea lacking a game and I feel as though Mysterium might have solved that. Without having yet played as the ghost though, I wonder whether the artwork is good enough to offer a lot of replayability and real clever play.

Moderately charming this did also seem to run a little too long and a successful first round pretty much sets you up for victory.

Update: Playing as the ghost is really stressful, but is also my favourite way of playing.

A cool little cooperative murder mystery that brings the mechanics of party game Dixit more into the realm of a gamer's game.

Is Mysterium just a cross between Clue and Dixit?  Yes.  It's a reasonable game of art association and that's a tough way to communicate.  Forget the ghost getting on your wavelength; there aren't enough cards for that.  It's up to you to get on theirs.  If you can cross that bridge, this might be fun.

Christmas gift 2014.

This is a great fun, deductive game. We tried it 2 player but never again as the fun is in discussing the clues with the other detectives. One of the plays in December 2014 we used Dixit cards to mix it up which was really fun but probably made it harder for the Ghost. When you are the ghost and people are guessing all the right or wrong things it is difficult not to let it show on your face but it is so much fun which is why I prefer being the ghost. I spent a fair amount of time hiding my face behind my hands. Great game for newbies or non-gamers with a party game feel. Absolutely love it!

I can see that there are issues with replayability if you always play with the same group as you may develop certain conventions or see the same clue for the same weapon/location/ person over again. Also there may be the increased risk of meta gaming, "well last time he chose my weapon as the poison so I probably don't have that..." The simple fix is to play with varied groups.

RATING: 7
I'm not the world's biggest fan of Dixit. To be honest, I'd rather not play it if I can help it. And I'd heard that this was Dixit meets Clue, which actually is a fairly good description. The thing that really turned me off of this game was a random comment about how in the first part of the game you should just pick your answer based on the color of the clue card you got... which sort of made this game sound like Dixit for idiots. And that's largely why I turned down the opportunity to play this game the first time around. I really didn't want to play a dumbed down version of Dixit where you're playing a color matching game.

Anyway, fast forward a month or two and the game appeared again and I decided that I was probably being unfair to the game. So I went ahead and gave it a try.

Everybody is on the same team in this co-op game. The ghost player picks a weapon, location and person for every player secretly. Then the ghost gives clues to the players from their hand of cards and draws replacement cards before giving clues to another player, or if they're completely stuck they can mulligan their hand up to three times during the game.

The players have to first identify the weapon, then the location and finally the person by the last day. If everyone has successfully figured out that stuff by the last day, then the ghost picks one of the people cards secretly and tries to get the group to correctly identify the person. From their hand of cards they show clues that identify the person and also show the clues they decided not to use. If the group picks the right person, everybody wins.

And... I like it better than Dixit. One thing that I like a lot better is that everyone is trying to work together and the goal is for everybody to figure out the clues they're given. That eliminates the oddness I hate in Dixit where you want to be obscure enough so that one person gets it, but nobody else does. It's kind of Dixit with a purpose. And this type of game is just more fun as a co-op. In particular if some players are horrible at interpreting clues, the other players can help them out. There's never a moment where "None of this makes sense!" screws just you... your team wants to help you get there too.

We played three games over the evening. And in one game things got hilarious when it was revealed Bob had been giving clues for the "magnifying glass" weapon which was actually a picture of a frying pan. This game is hard enough when you have to interpret ambiguous images with tons of random stuff to distract you. The game gets a lot harder when you misinterpret the cards that show only one unambiguous item.

I had a lot of fun with this one, but it definitely leans towards the lighter party game side of things.

cooperative deductive dixit.  but:  "The red hot game of the moment is kind of warm for me. There is no denying that its fun to play but I do find the games narrative to be a little odd. Why for the majority of the game is the ghost sending completely different dreams to the players? Especially as all but one of them are random and just plain wrong? And what really is the point of the Item and Location as they are not involved in the final resolution in any way?

The only part of the game that really makes sense is the final dream, where the ghost actually tries to tell the investigator who killed him. The rest really just feels like padding to add more gameplay to the game."

Finally bought the Polish edition from Portal's stand at UKGE as they were lovely people! Downloaded the English language rules from BGG and it plays just fine with 2-pl and the rules make perfect sense. Excellent and fiendishly tricky game. Probably ramp up the difficulty now (first two games on easy), but great fun.

Cooperative Dixit, with pictures as clues. It's super hard playing the ghost. I've really enjoyed my plays of this although it usually comes down to gut feelings as people tend to focus on different things (shapes, objects, colours, etc). Since Codenames has come out, I think my interest in Mysterium will reduce as that has a more grounded deduction element.

Awsome gem of a game, Dixit+Clue is exactly right, Dixit-with-a-purpose also work. At the moment the rules are kind of meh, hopping the French version will fix that.

[+] beautiful artwork! love the theme, easy to teach, encourages discussion, 
[-] setup is a bit annoying, polish rules are not clear/thematic, I expect I will play the ghost most of the time, wish there were more dream cards (you use almost all of them in a 6-7p game)

* played an hybrid version of the future French version in Cannes 2015, the new artwork and rules seem excellent

Variant: the way I play it, for N players, deal N+3 card sof each type. For each type, randomly draw N "innocent" cards (1 per player) + 1 for the real culprit.
The medium have 6 days to innocent their 3 cards. Ideally on the 7th day, there are only 3 cards of each type remaining. you then look at the 3 real culprit cards, and deal 3 dream cards (either assigning them to person/location/weapon for an easy game -or- shuffling them for a hard game) and if the mediums guess the 3 cards, everybody wins.

'Mysterium' is a cross between 'Dixit' and 'Cluedo', which won't mean a fat lot if you haven't played one or other of these, so in essence, one player; the ghost, must use picture cards to suggest the weapon used to kill them, as well as the location and the individual.
Some of the cards are not relevant or even contradictory so this is not an easy task for the player taking on this role. There are seven (game) days to achieve this and each player can receive a variable number of cards to assist in the deduction process.
A good interactive game. The ghost player may not converse clues to the other players, but the detectives may discuss their choices, as each tries to get the correct answer from the variable clues provided.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
"Dixit" meets "Cluedo". Said like this, it could seem a dud game, but it actually is a very clever limited communication co-op game, where the ghost player tries to communicate to the psychic players how, where and by whom he was killed. Definitely interesting and goes over well also with non-gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Essentially Dixit but it takes all the best bits (everybodies internal thoughts) & by making the game co-operative it vocalises them.  So you get to hear what everyone is thinking in reference to the deduction process.  I've had some long games but never have we stopped & thought that it was taking too long.  An enjoyable engaging game.

It's Dixit with storyline and purpose. And one main problem - the end game makes no sense. In the first part each player has to guess their own combo of "who / where / why". Other people can help. This is fun. If everyone guessed their items the game moves to the next phase - everyone guesses who was the real murderer out of those revealed. The whole guessing part is the Dixit mechanic, and is a pretty smart idea. However the whole storyline feels forced. The game doesn't invite you to draw connections between those cards or to guess a motive or a story. You basically have to first guess 3 cards each, then guess 1 card together. It really lacks an idea that would connect all those elements.

The idea is great, art is fantastic (I gave it 7 not 6 mostly because of it, it just makes you want to play, and after all this game is all about staring at the art), but the actual design is flawed. So the fun of the game really depends on your group and how you play it. I'm pretty sure my score would be higher if I had more people to enjoy it with. The problem is my friends prefer the randomness and fun of Dixit more than guessing clues in this one, and I can see why. It's just a matter of preference.

I got this as a christmas present not really knowing a lot about it. But WOW, what a lovely, funny, interactive, addictive and especially good deduction game. It's like Cluedo meets Dixit! First card is played and the fun starts. But beware, it's not at all easy to win! What I like about this game the most, is the fact that the ghost is not just a gamemaster handing out some cards. No, he or she actually gets sucked into the discussions of the investigators, allthough the ghost must remain silent. As a ghost, you start to pick up on the thoughts of the others and that might change your opinion which dreamcards to hand out. Meanwhile the investigators are having a blast figuring out what the ghost is trying to say. The suspense building up, the nice duration, the immense interactivity, the possibility to alter the level of difficulty. This is an original awesome game ... even with two players! Like Dixit, this game is shouting out the word expansion!

I like the concept of this game more than its execution. The idea of the ghost giving clues via Dixit-style cards is interesting but the whole experience is hampered by a sort of slow and nebulous pace. I think this game would work best with 3-4 players and I'd be willing to play it again with such a small group but I don't think I'd ever want to play it again with more than that.

Rather disappointed in this otherwise cool-sounding game.

I'm always on the lookout for good cooperative games, and this one is great because it can handle such a wide range of player numbers. It's not a strategy game, but it does involve a lot of thinking, hard decisions, and discussion. Setup is a bit of a hassle, trying to coordinate the ghost's cards with the investigators' cards, but after that it is quick to teach and smooth to play. The main flaw is that downtime during the ghost's turn can be an issue.

Co-op haunted mansion murder mystery. One player runs the haunt while the others players form a team of psychics. Their purpose is to work together and discover the wrong doing (who dunnit, where and with what) through dream cards to peacefully release the haunted residents. Unique win condition includes the ghost player. The ghost dream cards are abstract or surreal art that the investigators must infer there meaning. I will go on a limb and say this is Dixit wrapped in a murder mystery...and it is a fun variant. It causes a lot of after-talk on what the ghost was thinking. And the games go fast so that several players get a turn as ghost. Better with more players (up to 7) without adding a lot of downtime.

A vast improvement over the Dixit "clue inference" system, partly because the game is fully cooperative.  What I really like: (a)abstract cards (or sets of cards!) are used to give clues about other abstract cards and (b) the entire group can pore over all clues to help each player figure out their individual weapon/location/person card sets.

Still, there are two significant drawbacks.  First, in the games that I've played, there's a tremendous amount of downtime for the non-ghost players as the ghost decides which clues to distribute.  The second issue: cards and clues may start to grow familiar, particularly if you keep playing with the same group, so I fear there's a hard limit on the number of plays in the game.  To avoid this, clue "conventions" should be avoided at all costs, since they'll spoil the fun.  (E.g., if I give you this card as a clue, it always means that your location is the weird cave.)

Note: I loathe Dixit, so my enjoyment of Mysterium is a genuine surprise.

Guess what's in my head. This is another game that I played in the store with strangers and it was a bad time. Players didn't know how the ghost player thought or approached things, 2 of the players over analysed everything which extended the play time considerably. I couldn't wait for this game to end, I literally got up from the table and went for a walk.

Polish Edition. Bumped up 1 rating because the cards make the game, and the art is beautiful. The game, a cooperative I don't mind playing, is easy to learn. Ghost must try to keep game moving along or players will get bored. Probably best not played with higher player counts for that reason.

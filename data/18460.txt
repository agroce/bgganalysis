This one has given me headaches, so many rules and so much fiddliness, I tried to play it twice but even watching the walkthrough video is tedious and uninspiring. If you are a hardcore wargame fan go for it (do you like ASL?) but if you are not and you like a medium complexity game with more streamlined rules then try Band of Brothers or Conflict of Heroes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a very good system, which is *just* on the edge of too much complexity for me. The infantry rules are simple enough, and easy to absorb, but the vehicle rules and the scenario exceptions (there always seems to be a bunch) makes it a bit more work than I'd like. I get the definite feeling that if I could spend a few days playing some of the scenarios consecutively that it would be easy enough to internalize, however. 

The scenarios I've played have been fun so far.

This is the best system since the times of SL and ASL. LnL is immersive, detailed, accurate and very engaging. Band of heroes is the starting module and comes with a fairly big variety of scenarios that shows the immense potentiality of the system. Highly recommended for people who enjoy tactical platoon based games. The LnL modules released after this one complete the system and push it always a step further. From BoH to Heroes of the Gap, the player will find everything for every taste.

(G) Very fun and good game. More playable than ASL, more realistic than Combat Commander. The system of game is one the best in tactic level. My only complaints are about que quality of the counters (not the design, that is excelent, but the carton quality), and there are few mapboards to create new scenarios. I have played 2 scenarios face to face and one in solitaire. In comparison with Combat Commander, after 3 games with CC I sold the game, I did not like the CC system.
Lock and Load is different and better.

RATING: 8
This is Mark Walker's seminal games in the Lock 'n Load Series. I have played six scenarios thus far.  Like my other Ln'L reviews, I like this system because I find it the perfect balance between playability while retaining the historical and realistic challenges of squad level combat.

The scenarios are good.  They seem slightly more of entertainment value than historical understanding/reenactment.  But that is OK.  What is one of the best items of the game is how nicely the game can be played solitaire.

Nice map.  Nice counters.  Crappy rules.  Wish the map didn't have glowing edges, that's a serious downfall.

The rules fail to satisfy.  Not nearly a "light" game, but not crunchy enough for "heavy" game.  And doesn't feel right at all for a "medium" game.

Better than Forgotten Heroes for sure.  Great artwork, great components except for the cards are really crappy in both quality and artwork, and the very nice and stiff mapboards are marked with terribly bright, gradient while lines.  So it is hard to see the art beneath, which is a shame because it looks great.  Also, the scenarios are filled with these scripted events which is interesting the first time, and adds a fun RPG element a la Ambush! for solitaire play, it doesn't do much for the replayability of the game.  Has some very fun and dramatic games of this in the few times I have played it.  I recommend.

 lock n loaded is great for a lot of things its fast paced, action pack (played alot like a movie to be honest ),and its great soloable .

RATING: 7
A good addition to the Lock N Load franchise. The spotting mechanism, which works very well in the Vietnam game, 'feels' a bit contrived in this historical setting - but in general the system still seems to work. An entertaining game, enhanced by the system's applicability to a wide range of historical subject material.

I have been a long-time SL/ASL fan, but am beginning to love the LnL system.  Simple, yet meaty.  The tactical puzzles are challenging and fun to solve.  The counters and maps are simply beautiful.  Best of all, it is immensely playable.  The fun of SL/ASL in a package that is much better looking, and much more playable.  Can't wait to play more!

RATING: 5
I've slowly become somewhat disenchanted with this game. It's a game I really want to like - a simpler, clean-playing WWII tactical game. But Lock 'n Load has so many problems - terribly written rules and ugly boards, for one, but also a system that is strange in so many ways - Lock 'n Load is fundamentally pretty weak in its evocation of WWII combat. I mean, how good can a game be when it doesn't have reasonable rules for machineguns? Even Squad Leader, back in 1977, had a good conception of fire lanes and crossfire - in Lock 'n Load, every unit of firepower is identical. And while the impulse system sounds good in theory, it's a weak model for the reality and ASL(SK)'s more evocative sequence of play is no less interactive in my opinion.

All this would be problematic enough, but the huge showstopper here is that I haven't yet played a scenario from Band of Heroes that was either balanced or interesting. Most have been ludicrous blow-outs, and at least one was just dumb. Squad Leader would never have foisted some of these turkeys off on us.


Ultimately, LnL is neither simple, short or balanced enough for a "fun" game, nor is it evocative enough for a serious game, in my opinion. I'll give it a couple more spins, and maybe the expansion with the Brits will offer better scenarios, but Band of Heroes is perilously near the end of the line for me personally.

Oh yeah, plus it's really overpriced.

As a final note, I actually liked Forgotten Heroes (the first version of the game, set in Vietnam) substantially better. I'm not entirely sure why, but I think the combination of lower unit morales, weaker terrain but shorter lines-of-sight (the spotting rules felt a lot less hokey in FHV), and lower-density scenarios made for better games. Also, the events (one of the game system's great strengths, as well as one of its weaknesses) seemed better-done in FHV.

I love this game system. I really like the story telling aspect and the flexability to perform so many different actions. The rules were a little tough for me to get through, as sometimes the designer assumes I played ASL back in the day. The events are fun, but once you play the scenario the event doesnt change so replayability can be a little tough. Fortunately there are a LOT of scenarios I need to go through

Very excellent game.  Great mechanics and rules.  The rulebook could you a going over to clean them up and reorganize.  But, once you get the rules down, you hardly ever have to reference them anymore.  Fast game play, low downtime, and constant interaction.  

The only thing I don't really like is there is no jamming of guns.  But, that is all.

RATING: 7
A solid tactical game.  An amazing amount is covered in a relatively brief rulebook.  Unfortunately the rulebook is not written in normal wargame style and is a bit hard to read.  For example, when describing the several ways in which a unit can be spotted, rather than use a bulleted or numbered list, the criteria are simply provided in the body of a paragraph.  This syle of rules makes it hard to find stuff quickly...which is made worse by the lack of an index.

Still, solid game, outstanding unit graphics (and horribly overpowering hexside).  Overall, thumbs up.

Edit: second edition dispenses with overpowered hexsides, a huge plus graphically.

BoH is the new module of the LnL system, and is a completely stand-alone game. A very good thing: the rules manual is valid for the Forgotten Heroes module too, upgrading them to a new standard.
The graphic is really nice. You can play it solo, but IMHO it's simply NOT a solo game (in my collection you can find some nice solo games).
If you like tactical wargaming don't miss it.
Matrix and designer's support seems very, very good: I had a problem with my box, and they resolved it in a very professional manner. Good work!

I'm disappointed about the quality of the counters (not the graphic)... Matrix sent two set of replacement counters to me, but they are simply... not perfect. Badly cutted, miscentered... I hope that the next game in the series will use a different type of cardboard.

The scenarios are nice, but I would prefer more simple scenarios. 

I prefer Mark Walker's World at War series.

My favorite tactical squad level wargame (along with ASLSK). It plays like a streamlined version of games like ASL - less complicated but still gives the same feel to the game and with same depth. It has a strong [u]cinematic feeling[/u], every session tells a story. It's tense and dynamic. I love the total absence of any "eurogame-style", you can loose almost all units and win the game with the last unit!
The game has a step learning curve because the rules are not very well written.
Excellent scenarios with random setup/events and huge replayabiliy! Very nice components in the 2nd Edition.
Very high [color=red]solitaire[/color] suitability! I enjoy playing BoH solitaire almost all times.

RATING: 2
From the first page of the rules: you can stack up to three squads counters per hex, but only two individual (SMC) counters!? This was the first sign of the overall arbitrary, unintuitive feel of the game. The impulse system creates an environment of reaction rather than coordination. Some counters, though graphically nice, have a way of blending the stats into their background.

I love LnL. It is simple to play (compared to other tac war games) yet retains a ton of chrome. With the addition of the EF module, a good bit of WWII tac situations can now be played using LnL. The use of impulses alone does a good bit of making the game better than ASL(SK). 

Played more scenarios. the more i play, the more i like. 

Just received the 2nd edition of BoH. The new maps are fantastic and really kick up the LnL gaming experience.

Nothing short of a wonderful gaming experience! You get attached to your men and Leaders & Heroes. If u have played B17 and ever tried to get your wounded crew home...well u get the idea as u are very close to your crew...BOH/FH gives you so much atmosphere during gameplay that you-as a Hero-running up that street, with TNT satchel in hand, heading toward that German held building with an MG42 sticking thru a window...about to open up on u with Opportunity Fire...The pinned down squads behind you are depending on your success...you run and throw...

A brilliantly streamlined tactical World War II wargame, based on the original system developed in Lock 'n Load (which was centered around the conflict in Vietnam). It's like playing [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/game/243]Advanced Squad Leader[/url], but rarely needing to consult the rulebook. This lets players focus on tactics. Highly recommended!

I really want to rate this higher but as a WWII squad-level game, you get the inevitable comparison to the SL series and there's a lot of things about LnL:BoH that don't stand up to scrutiny. The rulebook follows the same bad format as LnL:FHV. and human-wave tactics are the way to go, since there's no concept of sustained fire. Once you've "opportunity fired", that's it, leaving you vulnerable to the next fella to come along and melee you.

Απογοήτευση. 
Άσχημοι χάρτες με "φωτοστέφανα" γύρω από τα εξάγωνα. Αυτό ας πούμε ότι διορθώνεται με το αρχειάκι των "καθαρών" χαρτών στα files.
Κανόνες που ενοχλούν αφάνταστα: spotting. Κρατάει μόνο ένα γύρο. Οι μονάδες με ένα μυστήριο τρόπο ξεχνάνε τι είδαν πριν μερικά δευτερόλεπτα και πρέπει να κάνουν νέα απόπειρα κάθε γύρο!
Υπάρχουν μονάδες με 0 firepower! Έτσι προκύπτουν νέοι κανόνες όταν θα πρέπει να μειωθεί η ισχύς στο μισό. Από την άλλη δεν είναι ευχάριστο να έχεις μονάδες με 0 επίθεση. Θα μπορούσαν αναλογικά όλες οι μονάδες να αυξηθούν κατά 1 χωρίς να δημιουργείται ανάγκη για έξτρα διευκρινήσεις.
Η κατανομή των στοιχείων στα support weapons δεν ακολουθεί τη στοίχιση των υπολοίπων. Έτσι ενώ όλες οι μονάδες έχουν firepower\range\movement οι εν λόγω έχουν *\firepower\range. Ασήμαντο ίσως, αλλά δείχνει απροσεξία που δεν θα στοίχιζε να μην υπήρχε ενώ τώρα μπερδεύει τον παίχτη.
Οι leaders δεν έχουν ακτίνα για να κάνουν rally. Αυτή είναι από τις μεγαλύτερες τραγωδίες. Αν μια μονάδα pinάρει απλά την έκατσε.
Μέσα στους κανόνες συνεχώς αναφέρονται περιπτώσεις που αφορούν σε ελικόπτερα. Αυτά φυσικά υπάρχουν σε άλλες επεκτάσεις και απλά εδώ ενοχλούν διαρκώς. Θα μπορούσαν να υπάρχουν σε ξεχωριστή ενότητα ή ακόμα καλύτερα μόνο στο Vietnam όπου κι αναφέρονται.
Κάποιοι χαρακτήρες όπως ο γιατρός κι ο ιερέας δείνουν ένα ευχάριστο χρώμα.
Ένα καλό στοιχείο rpg προσφέρουν οι κάρτες ικανοτήτων των αρχηγών\ηρώων.
Τα στατιστικά των αρμάτων και των πυροβόλων βρίσκονται στο πίσω μέρος των counters. Καθόλου βολικό να γυρίζεις συνέχεια το άρμα σου και να προδίδεις τις σκέψεις σου.
Καλοί κανόνες για τα άρματα πχ θωρακίσεις, facing.
Ο πίνακας με τα εδάφη, τα κόστη κίνησης και τους ειδικούς κανόνες τους είναι ό,τι χειρότερο έχει γραφτεί ποτέ. Να σημειωθεί ότι το manual δεν γράφει τίποτα για τα είδη των εδαφών. Φυσικά στον τεράστιο, δύσχρηστο πίνακα περιέχονται και εδάφη από άλλες επεκτάσεις, ίσα-ίσα για να μπερδεύουν ακόμα περισσότερο.
Τα σενάρια είναι πολλά. Εδώ υπάρχει κάτι περίεργο. Περιλαμβάνουν κάποια γεγονότα τα οποία ενεργοποιούννται όταν κάποιες μονάδες βρεθούν δίπλα ή στο οπτικό τους πεδίο. Οκ, προσθέτουν μια ευχάριστη έκπληξη, αλλά είναι πάντα τα ίδια και συμβαίνουν 100%. Οπότε όταν το σενάριο παιχτεί μία φορά και αποκαλυφθεί το γεγονός χάνεται μεγάλο μέρος της επαναληπτικότητας. Ποιός θα πατήσει εν γνώσι του ένα ναρκοπέδιο που πάτησε καταλάθος την πρώτη φορά; Αν δεν ήταν προκαθορισμένη εξαρχής η θέση του δεν θα υπήρχε πρόβλημα.
Για όποιον θέλει ένα καλό παιγνίδι τακτικής θα πρότεινα το Memoir 44 για κάτι εύκολο κι απλό, το Tide of Iron για σωστό, επικό  παιγνίδι με μινιατούρες ή το Combat Commander:Europe για το απόλυτο παιγνίδι τακτικής Β Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου ή ακόμα καλύτερα το Up Front αν μπορείτε να το βρείτε.

Many years ago i bought Avalon ASL but i never played it for i needed second life a to know all the rules!...when i got LnL series it took only few days to learn it and to enjoy its fascinating and elegant game system.

I can not enjoy myself with a game where the winner is not the best tactical player but the one who better knows or remembers the rules (...Appendix C of Under-paragraph D of Section E of Chapter D of ASL "monster" RuleBook!!!)

ASL is an Historical Encyclopedia more than a warGAME simulation...Avalon focused its attention on "War" forgetting the word: "game" 

LnL system is a very good mix of historical detail and fun

So if this is a simple wargame that shed most of the rules of its relatives then I think I'm quite happy with staying at this level for the time being. I expect I'll have the rules mostly memorized after a couple of plays but it still has exceptions for a lot of stuff. That the rulebook is terrible doesn't exactly help in this regard, though.

Still, in the long run it's probably the scenarios that need to keep the game afloat. Unfortunately, the events system - while cool at first - looks like a bit of a replay barrier.

I have mixed feelings about LnL: Band of Heroes. On the one hand I like the attempt to keep the rules relatively simplified, and I really like the artwork and atmosphere of the game. On the other hand, the rules are still too fiddly for my tastes (about 29 pages) and seem unsatisfying, for lack of better word. The hex halos were a mistake. Also, I wish the hexes were about double their current size so units and markers wouldn't have to be stacked as much. In the end, even though I thought I would be the target market for this game, I haven't enjoyed it that much. I can see how some folks would really like it though.

Bought this one along with the Swift & Bold expansion (2007). Have reservations about what you get for your money with Swift & Bold but have no reservations with BOH. Very nice production and an excellent looking game system. Now also have Not one Step Back. I really like the Lock 'n Load stable and have recently got more play out of it. The rule book is poor but once played a few times the rules and play seem a lot easier to comprehend and the game flow is very good. Really want to get more play out of this series.

For the price of the game, I expected better production values, though they are fairly high. The skill cards look bad after puching out of the sprues.

I also have to give this demerits for the lack of residual fire and the problem of exhausting the defenders' ability to respond with overwhelming stacks. But it does keep it simpler.

Excellent game.  This game system works great.  Big fan of the squad level WW2 games.  In my opinion the best WW2 squad level game out there.  Plays as good as classic Squad Leader but with half the rules.  Correction - 1/10 of the rules.

Like the original Lock 'N Load, this is a game that I could pick nits about all day long, but ultimately I love it.  The special rules for the SS and US glider troops seem more fiddly than they need to be, the glider troops seem underpowered, and satchel charges are overpowered.  The treatment of machineguns, which was poor in the original game, is even worse here, as the new assault fire rules essentially turn machineguns into assault weapons.  Some of the new rules, in particular the new vehicle rules (including acquisition, first introduced in the ANZAC expansion, which helps tanks flush infantry out of covered positions, as well as the contested dierolls for penetration) are simply excellent.  Overall, the rulebook is clearer and improved over that of the original game, although question marks still remain.  (Melee in particular still needs more explanation.)  Regardless, the game's strength is in its quick and simple impulse system which provides loads of fun as well as the chaos factor that more deterministic games such as ASL lack.  I, for one, am very excited that Lock 'N Load has finally made it to World War II.  The only major flaw that I see in this package is the scenarios.  Despite what the rulebook says, most scenarios do not have event markers, and most of the event markers that do exist simply randomize the German force pool.  A couple events have logic errors in them (e.g. a unit sees something happen in a hex that it doesn't have LOS to; a unit is forced to open fire upon a unit it can't legally fire at).  These scenarios simply do not bring out the historical flavor of WWII in Normandy the way that the Forgotten Heroes scenarios brought out the historical flavor of Vietnam.  This is not a fatal flaw for me, as I tend to make my own scenarios anyway, but I can see some people being very disappointed in the provided scenarios.

RATING: 8
This is my initial rating, though if if goes anywhere it will be up.  Everything (other than the crappy hero cards) is absolutely beautiful, which is a bit of an oxymoron for a wargame.  The impulse system is also genius as it keeps both players constantly involved in the scenario.  Really, my only complaints thus far are the poorly written rules (not complex, just vague) and occasionally unbalanced scenarios.  I realize not every battle in history was even but a little tightness on the VP track would certainly keep players more entertained.  Overall, I can't speak highly enough about the simplicity and fun factor of the module.

This game is surprisingly good for how simple it is. I'm not much of a WWII fan, but I enjoy playing this game a lot.

I like Lock'N Load games. I like movie style of them, fast action.

The Good: Wargame that plays in a couple of hours. Streamlined rules (for a wargame). Artwork is very nice ! Lots of scenarios / expansions to add !!

The Bad: The rules may be streamlined for a wargame, but will still be far too much for a eurogamer to stomach. The rulebook was not very well written. No help was given to gradually learn the rules - by playing certain scenarios first. However, once you have the rules down, they carry on to the additional scenarios (with minor rule additions).

The Ugly: Those ugly halo's around the hexes !!

RATING: 4
Initial rating based on solitaire play of two scenarios.

This is my second attempt to learn LnL, the first time using BoH.  (I tried the Vietnam game earlier).  I still think the mechanics are a blend of ASL, ATS and PG, but I think they're better for the WWII version of this game.  It's simpler than ATS, without as much chart lookup, but that's okay for a change of pace.  I prefer the detail in ATS, but would be willing to play L'nL once in awhile.

RATING: 4
Play of two scenarios revealed easy strategies, dice-fests, "random" events that you'll never forget (hampering replayability), and poor game balance.  Seemed thrown together, rushed.  Maps are beautiful but the large hexes restrict maneuver options.  I was hoping this would make for the perfect bridge between M'44 and ASL(SK).  Awaiting suggestions for better scenarios from my opponent, a huge fan of the system.

I love this game.  It's taken over my table and refuses to leave.  Replayability is high.  Solitaire has been working fine for me, as long as I remain impartial from side to side, which is hard to do, as you can become somewhat invested in your squads on any particular side.  It's a great game that grows better with your understanding of the rules and intricacies possible within them.

1st Edition ... ugh the chicken wire hexes! Fiddly rules. Meh. Maybe need to play it again but it didn't strike me. I have many other tactical games I like better.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
ASL feel, much more simplified mechanics, plus some Ambush-type random events and scenarios specialties, make this a winner at the beginning.  Fast paced, small map, clear victory objectives...all lead to competitive gameplay.  The first game on Vietnam is not my cup of tea because of the topic.  This time around, Normandy, much more interesting.  Go, Airborne 101, go!

The gamebox inside smells good, very not for a long time from other games. I guess it has something to do with the better quality papers of the map and rulebook. 

Version 2 Rules of Play is a 37-pages long including 6-pages of Example of Play on Basic Infantry Combat. Only 3 major phases in a turn outlined as Rally, Operations and Administrative. Kind of operations hectic full of activities. Not a complicated game structure but a lot of goodies crammed inside the system.  

Turns represent 2 to 4 minutes (and that's clearer than ASL scale). Most scenarios last for 8 or so turns representing 16 to 32 minutes, a perfectly good time scale to simulate at the height of a battle in the day.  49 of the 486 counters fell off from the trees. But they are all there. 

16 scenarios are included and wrapped in a pack sealed. The scenario on top is "Dogging Down the Road" outside of Beaumont, France 7 June 1944. 101st Airborne met 709th German Infantry Division (gee, they have that large assignment no. of the unit).  This is a very good and balanced engagement scenario (and don't be fooled by the tank assets the Yankees had).  One scenario even claims it is inspired by the classic war movie Saving Private Ryan. It really does and it is also a very tense and exciting scenario too (remember those sticky bombs?).  All in all, if you want Yankees faring off the Germans on the French soils or somehow you are fancy about all what happened back in those D-Days in 1945, these scenarios would wet your appetite for years to come.  Scenario design is one of the strong feature that the designer has and for tactical level game, it is important.     

The maps are all very beautifully rendered and detailed, bringing you back well into the period.  For example, you can see the electric pole on the road down the town, while looking over the church window for a gun shooting at you.  The scenarios are eminently replayable in my opinion like that in ASLSK.   

16 skill cards are unimpressive as to the art on the card. But I guess they serve the purpose. There is not a single section of rule on terrain and all must be referred to the Terrain Effects Chart. However, there are no sample terrain looks for each type of terrain. So I guess we must be expert on the European terrain, from rice paddy to wheatfield to bocage...Maybe the rice paddy is not here but in the Vietnam game. Download some of the player-generated TEC here in BGG, you'd need them. The rules also refer to LnL: Forgotten Heroes from time to time and obviously some of the rules are about that game. Finally there are 2 large 6-sided dices included. A rare item nowadays. 

The overall package is nice but apparently the inside box sleeve was not glued to the box so it was on the fly. I have to carefully take out the maps and other components for examination otherwise the edge would continue to peel off from the box.

The spotting rules, the timing, and the combination of the impulses at tactical level is important.  For example, although units marked "Ops Complete" cannot do anything offensively if failing the spotting action, MMCs under an "Ops Complete" marker can still conduct opportunity fire, which is a bloody thing. Unit under an "Ops Complete" marker can also fire at the enemy unit just spotted by him.  

Melee is also a bloody affair and can last the whole game until one side wins by elminating all the enemy units.  One can withdraw from the melee, or reinforces it on the contrary.  One strange thing about it is that other unit can't spot into the melee location and fires at it.

Initiative is won by rolling higher in the beginning of a turn.  Rallying troops (or leader) require 2D6 smaller than the unit's morale rating.  Wounded leader cannot rally and has -1 to his every ratings.  Shaken unit cannot spot and has to crawl back into building or other covering terrain.  

Band of Heroes is a competitive game you like more as you go with more scenarios as different situations arise and with different OOBs.  This is where the magic lies for this kind of tactical games.  Short scenario between 2 people makes the game on the strong side of face-to-face play.  Comparing the Band of Heroes with ATS Basic Game Ia both on the actions around Carentan, seems that Band of Heroes has a larger scope at company level than the squad level of ATS. Thus, ATS has a more up close and personal feel about it. Both are more streamlined than ASLSK I am sure. But as of now, I like ATS Basic Game system better than both Band of Heroes and ASLSK.  When Combat Commander comes in, I'd like to say all three games better than Combat Commander because it makes me stupid when I hold a hand of Soviet cards not usable to the situation on the map. 

Current ranking ATS > Band of Heroes > ASLSK > Combat Commander for tactical level WW2 wargames. I will try a hand at the Panzergrendier system soon. I suspect it would fall in between Band of Heroes and ASLSK.

2nd edition notes:

Some of the best graphics I have seen this year. But the counters are too thin.  Very fast to play, which is excellent. The subject matter is one of my favorites, too. But the realism of the whole system leaves a bit to be desired, especially the AFV (including the completely ahistorical/unrealistic infantry-carrying rules), and Machine-Gun/support weapon depictions.  I still prefer Combat Commander for now. I'll probably revisit again the House rules I did for this system a few years ago when I have some more time to correct some of the stuff I don't agree with (the game rules are very well written and are easy to modifiy).  If you are looking for a fun and simple game, you cannot go wrong buying this product! Sadly my own copy had very thin, misaligned counters. I expeceted more, even from a "Made in China" game. Counter quality always seem to be the "weak point" in non-Euro wargames. At least now the French Army, 1940, get decent treatment.


Super-basic rules suggestion; Don't allow AFV's to carry any troops at all in battle (but for halftracks), or give them any "protection" bonus when riding an AFV; this is completely fallacious.

Easy to play squad-leader tactical game.
Excellent graphics, alternate initiative, simple rules. The game rules are easy to learn but sometimes i find them too simple and lacking in capturing some aspects of actual tactical combat; a bit more of complexity would made a better game; also rules have been kept compact but they aren't too clear on several points and need clarifications. Being a ASL veteran, I find the post WWII (Vietnam, Falklands, Afghanistan, Somalia, 1985 what-if cold war turned hot) add-ons more interesting.

Good overall. Nice to have a squad-level game that doesn't involve a 2" thick binder of rules, especially if you only have a couple of hours. It's a sort of "stripped down" ASL without becoming overly simplistic and retaining some of the depth. After playing it again recently, my opinion of it has improved. It's fast playing and has a good amount of chrome, without becoming bogged down in tremendous detail. I would say that there could be some additional bits of chrome (weapons jamming, for example), that would spice up play without adding too much detail. You also don't have to spend a fortune to get a large variety (or at least a good number) of scenarios.

Very playable. Relatively few rules, especially in comparison to other tactical wargames. I like the quality of the scenario sheets, the mounted maps and the graphics on the counters. I don't like the hexgrid on the maps which is too intense and diminishies the importance of the other features of the map. I don't like the cards which are cheaply made and cannot be put into standard plastic sleeves. Finally I don't like the fact that it wasn't easy to separate the counters and some of them got a bit damaged during the process.
But all these compaints are minor compared to the excitement and the playability that this game provides. I recommand it to all those who always wanted to play ASL (probably owning every single expansion of it) but found it too hard or time consuming to master.

RATING: 7
The LnL system is pretty simple, and can be a nice bridge to more complex systems such as Advanced Squad Leader and the Advanced Tobruk System.  However, I think that the rules could be tighter (2nd ed.).  They are vague in some areas, somewhat disorganized, and lack mechanic-specific examples within the rules.  (There are two extended examples in the back of the rulebook, but they are more narratives than examples, so it difficult to find an example when you need one).  The combat procedures need to be clearly spelled-out using bullet points so you don't have to fish for them in the body of the rules.  Nit picking aside, the more I play LnL, the more I like it as it plays fast and provides a good narrative.

Combat is is straight-forward: Attacker adds up his firepower factors plus any leadership bonus and rolls a die.  The defender rolls a die and adds any terrain modifiers.  If the attackers result is higher, the defender does a damage check for each unit in the hex.  The difference in the die rolls are added to a die roll and compared to the units morale rating then find the result on the chart. Results can be no effect, shaken, casualties, or eliminated. Ordnance is fired seperately and requires a To Hit roll after applying applicable modifiers.

Yup, after a slow and painful (not to say annoying) process of learning the rules and gaining confidence (my first squad-level game) I have come to like this and the series of which it forms the foundation. The little maps sizzle with beauty when battle is in full swing and I have a 'sense' of the predicament unfolding before my bulging eyes. Very good indeed if you can stick with MWs somewhat loose rules style.

Complaint? Well..., I don't like the cover. Er...give us some more examples of play, Mark. That way we see how some of the questions raised by the rules book are resolved.

I'm annoyed with myself for coming to this system so late in the day. I did try it some years ago and thought some aspects of the firing felt counter - intuitive but now I can't really remember why I thought that. There are some clever aspects to the system. I really like the impulses and there is a real sense that the designer has continually striven to keep processes effective but streamlined, so that play remains easy. There is an absence of the 'exception' type rules that can plague games that cover potentially complex subjects. Also streamlining can be seen in the vehicle rules that share many of the infantry processes. 

Getting into this game strongly reminds me of the pleasures that I had with the original Squad Leader game in 1977. A combination of clean system, good narrative based play and being visually splendid, makes this a delight to both own and play. Love the big counters, clear graphics and decent sized hexes.

At this point in time, the game modules cover periods from 1939 to 1985, which is impressive for a system that also remains very accessible. 

My only wish would be that as the prime core module, I would rather have had say half the number of para squads and instead have some line infantry added (which you do get with the Noville module).

Finally broke this game out to try the system.  Coming from ASL, I generally like the simplicity.  However, the rules (I have 1st edition) just always aren't as clear as I would like.  Also, it seems that combat resolution leaves widely varying results, but that may just be my first impression.  Overall, I am happy with the system.  And actually like it better than other options.

I've only played this solo but I do enjoy it. The rules aren't overly complex but the rule book makes it sound harder than it really is.  Get the new player aid as it helps get the basic concepts through.  My understanding of the game accelerated after using it.

Comments relate to First Edition

Rules : Version 2 in the LnL series. Magazine style (i.e. hard stock cover). Well written and organized. Will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has played the the other games in the series. Has done a nice job of tying everything together from v1 and the update in ANZAC Attack, as well as any new items specific to WW2. Six page example of play covers infantry, armor and helicopter combat in detail and with pics. There is a counter reduction chart at the back (certain German and US squads can break down into 2 varying quality half squads based off a die roll) that I think would be best reproduced in a player aid format so you can avoid flipping thru the rules. Twenty-eight pages total for just the rules. 

Player Reference Card : Card stock; packed with info - again similar to the other games. Card is a fold out - esentially 4 pages. Combat related items are front and back, with terrain chart in the middle portion. Terrain has GREATLY expanded from the Vietnam games & the chart is just slightly on the busy side, but extremely functional so no complaints from me on format. I do wish there was a way to essentially break this into 2 independent sheets as I think (personal preference) it would be easier to reference and have out on the game table. 

Scenario Cards : Again the same as past games. Card stock quality. Historical info at the top with opposing forces below that. Back side has map alignment, victory conditions, turn track and any special scenario rules. About 16 cards with plenty of variability due to triggered events and varaible reinforcements. 

Skill Cards (16) : Slighly lesser quality than standard playing cards, each lists a leader / hero trait or ability. These range from increasing combat abilities to improving movement to setting an ambush which could trigger additional forces to be added to the OB.  Art work is pretty nice on them.

Counters : Fantastic. Art work is top notch in my opinion. The detail is noticable and well done and gives plenty of variety to the units portrayed. Die cut is very good - counters almost fall off without effort. Game info on the counter is only what you need to play (strength, range, movement) and does not clutter or impede the art work. The only real thing I can 'complain' about is that some of the names on the heroes can be a bit hard to read (mixture of small font and background color). Counter mix is squads, individual vehicles, weapon teams and support weapons. 

Maps : I've never been a fan of mounted maps, but these have changed that. Individual maps so there's no folds and they are sturdy, but not too thick (fit nicely under plexiglass). Artwork is very detailed and crisp (tree stands for instance have distinguishable differences in the individual trees & urban areas have a nice variety of house looks). The hex outlines make terrain recognition simple (but at times can detract from the artwork) and 'heavy' center dots should make LOS pretty easy to determine.

Gameplay:  impulses move fast and smooth.  Scenarios have been running me 1-2 hours to play and have all come down pretty much to the end to determine victory.  I have not had any major playbalance issues or concerns over unachievable victory conditions, but some scenarios, due to turn constraints, seem to force one side into entering the fight a bit quicker than you may want as opposed to developing the situation & properly bringing all units / weapons to the forefront.

Overall - if you are looking for entry in tactical gaming, this is highly recommended as the simplicity of the system and outstanding components are tough to beat.

"Complaints" - First - I wish some of the scenarios were larger in terms of map space to get more of a maneuver feel to the game.  Second - I'm not ready to truly vote either way yet, but some of the scenarios have a feel of being impossible for one side or the other (not that this is atypical of any game!).

Good tactical wargame.  Small map size and quality components make for a fun experience that doesn't take up heaps of room.
The scenarios also have trigged events when certain hexes are landed on and this adds some randomness to the battles.
Lots of fun to play solo.

I recently bought both this and the Falklands Island Expansion (A Ring of Hills) hoping to find a good all round, general small unit tactical war game.  Overall it looks like a pretty decent game, but there are just a couple things that kept me from rating it higher than about a 6.

I guess the biggest couple of issues for me are that: 

1) Its kind of hard for me to tell what each counter is supposed to represent (in terms of numbers of troops, base weapon types, etc) and as such how the attack factors and ranges are determined?

Does one counter have an attack factor of 3 while another has an attack factor of 2 because one represents a squad of 12 men while the other only contains 8, or perhaps is it that one unit is armed with assault rifles but the other SMGs, etc?  

2) What do the damage steps represent, and why does attainable range decrease for some units when damaged?

When a Single Man Counter is attacked it appears that this individual can be "wounded".  However, when a Multi Man Counter is attacked it appears that the results only address being shaken and/or a step reduction to the counter.  As such, it doesn't seem that you can have an instance (like in the accounts of "Blackhawk Down" where a serious injury to a regular "soldier" can greatly impact a mission.

3) Its unclear why attack factors don't really seem to vary much with range (except for those special counters that can fire at twice there range but at half strength)?  I'd have thought that maybe for some weapons there effectiveness might drop off a bit at various ranges).

Overall, I don't think that these are necessarily big issues and in general the rules are nice, the board looks great and overall the game is very payable as is but they kind of make me wonder if the game might end up glossing over some issues that otherwise might be tactically of interest.

PS.  Also, I realize that this last bit may seem to be really minor but its also a bit odd to me that on the one hand you have a really great looking overhead view for the map and overhead view of the vehicles, but the general unit counters show some people in profile and the leaders are shown as kind of disembodied heads.  Its really not a big deal, but while they are nice looking counters they seem a bit out of place (though I guess you can replace them with homemade ones if you want).

A fantastic game, I have most of the expansion modules too

Initially the format of the base rulebook put me off, but after several re-reads (over 6 months) and making a few notes this game is in my top 5, it'll be a firm favourite for years to come.

I love the story driven scenarios and the quality components - simply can't fault it for what it provides... which is fast, fun and tense tactical battles on beautifully generated maps.

Highly Recommended

Excellent squad based game.  I love the rules as they are in-between being grognard complex and basic.  Seems to have everything one can do but doesn't bog down.  

The maps are colorful and the counters are very nice.  I like seeing the men and tanks instead of NATO symbols.  Some of the best counters in the business.

The scenarios have history and flavor and you get enough to play for weeks.  Even though a scenario isn't that long there are enough of them to play.  

I have played it solo and it works fine.  Just try your best to support whatever side you are playing at the time.  I found it narrative and exciting to play.  Very easy to imagine being there.

If you are looking for a straight up shoot em up WWII squad base game, you would do fine with this one.

An very good game in a crowded niche. Quality of the components initially caught my eye, and I like the mechanics more with every play.

Plays pretty quickly, and the mechanics are solid.

Fun game.  Intuitive enough to play quickly but detailed enough to let you feel that sound tactics make a difference.  I still enjoy pulling this one out and playing it whenever I can!

The rules need a couple of tweaks to cut down on some of the "crack" tactics and clean up some stuff. But, overall it is a fun system which catches the flavor of small unit combat in WW2.

The British and East Front make this stay vibrant.  Works well with scenarios/maps from ATS and ASL (Pegasus Bridge, Streets of Stalingrad, Arnhem, Tractor Works...)

This is:  a dynamic, improved Squad Leader. It moves quicker, and has intuitive decision making. Most important, the impulse system - with segmented and alternating movements per turn - allow for the ongoing development of tactics at any given moment.-The entire system, albeit a bit dense to first master, is flexible and expandable to many domains.

I considered buying this to find a squad level game I could teach my nephews. I finally had an opportunity to play it at a local Con recently, and I was very disappointed. Although it doesn't have as much chrome as ASL, the rulebook is poorly organized.  The spotting rules make spotting units way too easy.  I also don't like the glowy hexes.  They really distract from the artwork. I even missed a stone wall because of the glow hexsides. I won't be buying this game.  The ASL Starter Kits are better.

Got a good deal on the 2nd edition, I will not buy older editions, I can't stand looking at those halo boards!  Recently, with the new boards, I've become a fan of Lock N Load for it's production standards and it's streamlined play.  However, Advanced Squad Leader still rules the WW2 theater for me with it's approach to the use of machine guns, fire lanes, concealment, and "do it yourself" scenarios.  I'm happy to own this, I'm just not sure how much I'll play it.

RATING: 6.5
This is a decent game, but I would prefer to play Tide of Iron or Conflict of Heroes if I am going to play a squad level game.  The game have a number of downsides.  The rules are not written very well and a lot of explanation outside the rulebook is needed.  The game seems to assume you have played ASL and are familiar with its terminology.  I was not crazy about the scenarios, as they had surprise elements you are not supposed to read until you get to a certain round.  Also, there were a lot of scenario-specific rules, which I tend to shy away from.  Also, the combat system makes it hard to kill enemy units.  You really need to be familiar with the "shake and take" tactic prior to playing.  Otherwise, the game has the potential to drag, as units tend to break only to rally soon thereafter.

On the plus side, it's a nice looking game.  On the other hand, the rules are unnecessarily fiddly for a game looking to present a clean and fresh approach to squad level combat, and it just feels clunkier and less elegant than any of the current crop of competitors (Band of Brothers in particular highlights the contrast).  I don't see how this one will make it to the table.

Nothing new here. Though i realy like the components i have some viewpoints on the game itself i would like to share with you . First i have to say that Mr Walker did not invent a new  wheel here. A lot of the rules reminded me of ASL(which i play for over 15 years now) which is not a bad thing. The impulse system, praised on the box as unique is very similiar to Critical Hits Advanced Tobruk and was seen in other games before. Exactly this impulse system makes it a good two player game. On the box again it says that the impulse system would make it a good solitaire game too(8 out of 10, a thing which a cant see).Also there are things as the events in certain scenarios that will take the fun out of them when played solitaire. But giving a game a high rating there seems to be a industry standard today.If you can live with Mr Walkers lightharted style when writing rules(that are sometimes a bit unclear)you get a working game with very good components (i did not like the white outlinigs around the hex sides, they make the bords kind of "blurry" (in lack of a better term) for my eyes.But the components are not everything...

I will definitely read the rules again and play it a lot more.

After playing ASL for so long it was hard to enjoy this system. I prefer more substance and realism and thought the counters and map were a tad cartoonish. The rulebook was also poorly organized. If I had started playing Lock n Load before ASL I probably would have enjoyed it more. I got the feeling it was a valient attempt to dumb down the ASL rules but for me it only succeeded in reducing the excitement of tactical combat.

Of all the WWII tac systems out there, this plays the smoothest. The v.3 rulebook is very good.

There are a few odd quirks that I need to work my mind around, but LnL may end up being my favorite tactical system after all. I just need more experience with this particular game to rate it higher.

Comments by a long time SL player. Lock n Load (we played a small scenario without events but with chaos) is so like Squad Leader I was having trouble spotting the advances. It felt more cramped than SL, and the spotting was both good and bad, but it scores on the interactive impulses and the unknown turn ending.What we felt was cheap was the lack of terrain key in colour. Okay.

RATING: 2.5
Weak, poorly written rules accompany this otherwise nice-looking game. Game play is somewhat ho-hum when compared to other WWII tactical games (ASL, ATS, Panzer/Armor/88). I don't understand the nearly cult-like following this game has developed - the rules are convoluted (despite its author's claims) and difficult to interpret in spots(and I'm not dumb, either - I play and understand ASL and SFB perfectly well, thank you). Great graphics EXCEPT for those damned huge white hex outlines on the map panels (which, again, the author claims he never met anyone that complained about them....HA!). Scenario balance is nearly non-existent in the set provided, AFV combat is a bit on the parochial side, and the "don't read this paragraph to find out what happens next until X happens" mechanic is trite, only offering a minimal "surprise" factor the first time you play a scenario. IMO, it's just the opposite of the company tag line: it's More Guff, Less Game.

One final note: if you really MUST have this game, DO NOT buy it from the author on eBay. While I have no proof, I suspect he has someone shilling for him, as both auctions for this game that I had bid on I lost, only to receive a "second chance offer" for BOTH auctions within 24 hours of each other. Additionally, I wrote to the author because there is either a discrepancy in the contents listed on the box or I was shorted a set of combat charts. He never responded to my inquiry.

I just don't like the Lock n Load squad system (their platoon system as seen in the World at War and Nations at War series is great though). Perhaps it's because of the messy rulebooks. I also think it adds chrome where it's not needed. For example, the spotting rolls add nothing. They don't add to the fog of war, my soldiers still "know" there is an enemy there and won't fall in the trap, they just need to spot them before they can fire. The vehicle rules with turret facing and modifiers for being buttoned up or not also don't add much to the experience except for a headache from trying to find the paragraph in the rulebook. And this is coming from someone who can play OCS (more or less), so I'm not afraid of fat rulebooks.

Just picked up in Math Trade. Looking forward to playing this weekend.

Update: Didn't get to play FTF like I wanted, but I did play several solitaire games.  I really liked the FLASH...THUNDER scenario.  Pretty cool, with the random activations going on.  Lots of chaos much like I imagine was going on on that fateful day.  

Rating based on first couple of plays.  

It took a few going back and forth with the rulebook, but the system is starting to gel in my mind.  I can see where this system is going to be lots of fun.  Can't wait to play a live opponent.

UPDATE: Have played several live opponents. Both have enjoyed the game very much and it is quick to pick up and learn.  One opponent liked the game so much he bought his own copy!

OK, but not nearly as good as Conflict of Heroes or Fighting Formations.  The fighting and damage series of rolls made the game less intuitive and slower without really adding any value.  Spotting rules also slowed the game down and made it more frustrating.  Not being able to rally broken units without a leader, made it painful with low leader scenarios when they were wounded early as did getting wounded if there were not any medics in the scenario.  The game mechanics also seem to reward just sitting in cover and firing rather than making assaults - it may be realistic, but it leads to boring play. The counters look nice, but the map is meh.

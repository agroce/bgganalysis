This is close to my favorite party game, and would be if Codenames didn't exist. This game's humor manages to be satirical without being mean or gross, and it allows for some genuinely funny moments. My favorite part is that the ailment that you are trying to cure each round is the side effect from the previous round, which is so true that you have to laugh.

Social deduction and party games are not my favorite genres but this is a cute, quirky game. With the right people it could be a lot of fun, but I don't see it becoming popular with my regular group.

A fun party game with a twist!
I decided to pick this up after throughly enjoying another of Gil Hova's games, The Networks. While they are fairly different style games, the unique nature of his games (the fusion of theme with mechanisms) can still be found here.
In Bad Medicine, players assume the roles of pharmaseutical companies tasked with creating a drug, describing how it cures the current malady, and minimizing the side effects (cards given to the presenter by other players during mid-pitch). The game plays quickly (approximately 30 minutes) and had some very humorous situations, my friends and I had a couple of good belly-laughs. It plays 3-8 players which is a nice range for a party game. The only potential downside has little to do with the game, if you and your friends are not fond of pitching or improvising you may not enjoy this format as much. For me this game is just what the doctor ordered!

MG2016 51/150.  Tries too hard (eg, drug names, disturbing sexual or genital conditions) to be a funny party game.

Making up an entertaining story on a fly works the imagination and definitely brings laughter as you watch  others pitch formulations prepared by their teammates. This is a high energy level game for those who seek a humorous evening with sociable friends. I particularly had fun figuring out how to sell a new medicine for those who have trouble  making left handed turns.

Party game similar to Snake Oil.  Got it on Kickstarter.

It's good for a few laughs.  The design-to-play could be a little smoother.  Three or four times we had to go back an remember which parts of the card we would use when.  Even then, some players kept getting confused.

It was good for a few laughs.  We may break it out from time to time.  I trashed the adult pack that was included--not our style.

This game is a lot of fun. I really like how the game flows, and how each card can be used for the different parts of the drugs, the name, how it effects the malady, or the side effect. Then how after the  first round the winner of that round, the side effect on his drug becomes the new malady that needs to be fixed.

My feeling on this is similar to other party games. You create drugs by mixing cards with various portions of words and treat funny side effects. Nothing that gets me excited.

Got to briefly mess around with playtest copy of this game. The way the texts on the card combine to create the drug name and effects is very innovative. Interesting idea about creating a sales pitch for the drugs, modified by what the other players throw at you.

Overall, though, not my type of game. Not a fault of the game itself, just not something I would play.

immature, juvenile, crude content on the cards. This is like Snake Oil and Cards Against Humanity mixed. Has some funny moments, but mostly dependent on the crowd of people playing. Played once, no interest in it again.

It's actually a really good game, that works as a party game.  However, it often doesn't get played because it is a lot of game for a party game.  And frankly, it puts a lot of work on me to make sure everyone else is having fun.

But it's fun, a somewhat unique combination of elements you can find in other party games.

If I didn't love the theme, this would probably get ousted by some of the amazing party games coming out that implement similar things in a more streamlined way.

But I do love the theme - and it's really well implemented in this game that is deservedly heavier and actually somewhat more satisfying than your average party game, when it gets to the table.

for a game of making marketing pitches, I much prefer X-machina. This one's just not that funny. Bought mostly because I worked in the pharma industry and thought it would be funny.

Backed this on Kickstarter.  Really enjoyed playing it.   Had too much fun to care about the points.   Loved how zany and creative it was.   The theme really shines and the pitches were a lot of fun.  Has a much wider audience compared to Cards Against Humanity.

I haven't had this much fun and laughter in a long time!  Very, very well done party game that I will play often once I get a copy!  The way the drug names, efficacy and side effects work is actually quite ingenious.  Played with designer at The Gathering.

Fun party game -- have played the four-player version but I'm curious to try the versions with more.  Had some genuine laugh-out-loud moments in response to people's names and pitches!  I could see how this would not work with everyone, though, since it requires a bit of on-the-spot creativity that some players might be anxious about.

Best when people are a little high, but works well with the strangest bunch, as long as they're willing to make a sales pitch on the impromptu. 

Have played this with a large group by having 6 folks, 3 doing the formulating and 3 doing the pitching, before rotating the pitchers into formulation and they can pick the next pitcher. 

Have had multiple requests to play again, as well as a few friends who picked up copies or asked how to pick up copies.

Learned how to play from the game creator at a local game store.  It is an entertaining game of drug creation and marketing.  Played with 3 players and it was fun.  The description of the rules when there are 5 or more players sounds even more fun.  I am going to back on Kickstarter.

Probably designed by prepubescent kids. When you think trees have been cut to produced this, the authors should be sued for environmental damages. 

Making names of medicine with syllables like cox, porn and dik may be fun when you are 9 but not when you are a grown up. As to have to make up "story" on how to treat childish diseases is fun for the time it takes to teach this game, no more.

Poor production with very basic card design which look like they are used, and not even counter to keep score.

Move on.

Bad Medicine is a party game which works best with 6 or 8 players. Every round players are randomly divided into teams of 2. Each team is made up of a "formulator" and a "pitcher". There's some disease/condition in the middle of the table that needs to be treated and each team is going to try and create the best sales pitch for a new drug to treat that disease.

Each card is divided into three sections. At top is some syllable. In the middle is some medical term/part/treatment... although many of them aren't at all. And at the bottom is some side effect. The formulator gets six cards and their job is to create a name with 3 syllable cards, create a possible treatment with 2 cards and select a side effect with the remaining card.

Then the pitcher gets the cards and starts their pitch for a new wonder drug. They don't see the cards until they've already begun and have to incorporate the card information on the fly.

After all the teams have pitched a drug, everyone has to vote for which pitch was best (you can't vote for your own team). Every vote for your team is a point for you. The winning pitch's side effect is the disease/condition for the next round.

Example: On the last turn, I formulated a drug called Pro-pon-ny, which treated "all your toenails becoming ingrown" with "vertical jumps" and "sense of fashion" that had a side effect of "melting your liver".

Watching players try to come up with something on the fly was hilarious. And watching someone with a silver tongue sell a ridiculous product was quite impressive. It won't work with every person, but in the right group, this is a lot of fun.

Not funny enough for a good party game, and not a good enough game to be good strategically, Bad Medicine tries to satisfy both kinds of gamers and ends up satisfying neither.  Pretty much as soon as I started playing this game, I was wishing it was over.  It's a shame the game is a bore, as the designer is a long-time and prolific BGG contributor whose writing and opinions I like.  If you're looking for a better game of this type, try [gameid=696] which uses the pitching idea in a more free-form way that allows the creativity of the players to flourish more.

RATING: 6
Interesting deduction game without much excess attached. Boiled down and direct as a result to get right to the cerebral gameplay. On the negative side, it has almost no theme and nothing colorful to foster attachment.

Oh man. This is very similar to my favorite childhood game, Clue, but without having to roll and move to get information. I absolutely love it.

1 Play.  Very streamlined deduction game, will be over very quickly with strong players. That actually might be a problem with larger player counts, because in our one 4 player game each person just happened to go 3 times. This was because each of us spent 2 turns looking at all of the middle cards.  It is possible (especially at 6 players) that the game might be over after some players had had only one (or no) turns.

PROS:
-Reglas muy sencillas de explicar y de entender
-Alto componente de deducción (es una mezcla entre Cluedo y Tricoda, pero mucho mejor implementado que cualquiera de ellos)
-La posibilidad de elegir qué preguntas hacer te permite diseñar tu estrategia deductiva
-Un jugador con una elevada capacidad deductiva puede ganar sin problema a jugadores con experiencia en el juego
-Los componentes son de muy buena calidad (¡incluye lápices!)
-El taco de papeles para anotar deducciones es muy grueso
-El modo 2 jugadores está bien pensado

CONTRAS:
-Si alguien se equivoca al responder una pregunta, algo bastante frecuente, la partida se estropea
-El tiempo para pensar y deducir es necesario y ralentiza el juego
-Poder "ir probando" si se acierta la combinación sospechoso-arma-lugar le quita algo de interés

In 13 Clues, you see other people's cards, not your own. You win if you figure out what three cards are on your rack. Each rack will have one person, one location, one weapon. The game is called "13 Clues" because after crossing out the initial cards that you see (on other player's racks and the two behind your screen), you are always left with 13 cards that you must narrow down on your own.

There are enough similarities between this game and Code 777 so if you like one you will probably like the other. Here are the main differences:

1) There are two cards that you cannot see per player! This becomes trickier to narrow down the more players you play with but is what makes it most interesting/different.
2) The game state does not change. The cards you see on people's racks are the same for the entire game.
3) You can only make an accusation on your turn as an action. You are told if you are right or wrong, and if you are wrong there is no penalty; you continue the game with the same cards.
4) It is possible to have more than one action per turn. # of actions are determined by how many magnifying glass tokens you have, and you generally get them when someone asks you a question. Nice balancing as if everyone asks you a question that round, you'd have a ton of magnifying glasses. This tends to incentivize players to ask questions fairly equally.

This is a pure deduction game. You have a sheet of paper showing all the cards in the game and you need to eliminate all but three possibilities. 

The unique twist is that each player has 3 cards (a person, place, and weapon) in front of their screen facing away from them (Hanabi style). Those are the cards you need to find the identity of. To do so you can ask questions of your opponents, such as "how many outdoor locations do you see". They then give an answer that everyone hears. The cards they see are those in front of each other player and 2 more which are behind their screen; this is the critical bit of uncertainty that makes it hard to decipher someone's response. 

When someone makes a declaration of which cards are in front of them the other players simply tell them if they are correct or not. If yes they win, if not play continues the person is not eliminated as is the case in many deduction games where secret cards need to be peeked at. It's nice that no one is eliminated, but because of this the risk/reward of throwing around declarations is much lower. This means people guess more often when they are uncertain, which means the game is often won by someone making a slightly random stab in the dark.

The game might also be won more often by players later in turn order. There was quite a lot of discussion about this. Since questions are heard by all, the early players seem to be at a disadvantage. If the game lasted many rounds this effect would get washed out, but it only lasts 2-3 rounds.

It was fun, short, and focused on deduction. If you like deduction games give this one a shot.

Tried this during Essen spiel 2016 and played only one game.

The material is of good quality with nice artwork.
Rules are simple as it is a pure deduction game with no luck.

Player turn are quick so you don't wait too long before your next turn.

Six player game where the game ends before one person gets to play his first turn makes a broken game. Never again.

nice simple game, once you've learned the rules (it really takes a few minutes, we've played it with not-so-young people and they didn't have a problem) a game takes about 15 minutes

RATING: 5
The next generation Cluedo. Forget dice rolling, forget moving around the board AND just make the right kind of questions when it's your turn. Beatiful looking and overproduced game. It's a bit better than Cluedo, but that's not much to said.

Deduction; what cards are in front of you.

13 Clues is not original at all, just a copy of Clue, with an idea stolen from Hanabi (that you don't see your own cards).
But this is actually the best part, beacuse the game is unbelievebly bad. It's a deduction game with a lot of luck involved, you have a variable number of action for each turn that depends from who the other players wants to give it to. And the worst part is that it's very fast, so if you are the last player to start and no one gives you actions, you can do just 2 action in the entire game while some players con do 7-8.
Maybe it is better of you play it in 3 people, in 5 or more it's terrible.
Never again.

Sounds like a decent basic deduction game at first sight but is completely unplayable at higher player counts.

Kingdomino is a filler, this is not. This game has content of filler but time (and somewhat complexity) of a real game. That means content to time ratio is poor. 

Game is not actually that bad I rated it for, but I can not to compare this to Kingdomino, which is a elegant filler. I don't see any occasion I would play this instead of Kingdomino. That is why I'm giving such bad score. Kindomino simply packs interesting bits of this game in much more compact package.

I like this one better than Kingdomino since it adds more layers to it with different ways to earn points. The learning curve is slightly steeper. Also, it may not be nearly as accessible for younger kids as Kingdomino.

Once upon a time a King designed a simple, award-winning game, the clever old fellow.    Everyone was happy for him, except for the Queen, who was jealous.  So the Queen designed her own game, which was remarkably similar.  Except that, in the style of the times, she added a way to earn money to buy buildings that scored victory points in several different ways.  To ensure the game's success, she put an ornamental tile tower and a piece carved in her own image in every box.  And the game was all right, although some of her subjects hankered after the elegant simplicity of the King's game,  Some ingrates even moaned that her innovations lengthened the playing time and were not very  exciting.  The Queen had their heads chopped off and everybody else lived happily ever after.  The end.

RATING: 6
It's billed as a step up from Kingdomino... but even that isn't very much. The only real rule change is buying buildings, which are really just more point scoring opportunities. This still isn't 'gamers' kingdomino or anything.

Tile laying game, not really my favorite. Fun enough if you're into this, but whether you win also largely depends on the willingness of other players to let you win. You can easily screw someone over, which also means you screw yourself and the third person wins :)

Never played Kingdomino, but based on the description and what my friends told me, that it would be far too simple of a tile laying game for my normal tastes.  The added mechanics of burning specific building and jockey-ing for the queen added enough complexity to make it a light-medium game and interesting to play as a longer filler.

Although I didn’t play Kingdomino, I did play Queendomino, which I guess could be labelled as Kingdomino Plus or Kingdomino Pro if it were an electronic device. It was fun and the tile drafting system was simple, yet clever as a balancing mechanism. I can see why they are separate games (well, besides making more money) - the extra elements of Queen make more interesting for gamers, but would confuse non-gamers.

Queendomino really does a nice job of adding on more game to the basic system in Kingdomino. I'm not sure it's any better of a game, but there is more to consider and more options for scoring. King and Queen can be played together with more players, but I haven't done that yet.

The game that Kingdomino should have been from start, Queendomino concocted the right blend between simplicity, strategy and randomness: the result is a light to medium family game that also suits more demanding gamers.

Certainly better than Kingdomino. The buildings allow you to "focus" your game more, shooting for a specific strategy rather than just going for large regions. Competition over the queen also makes the game more tense (though we've found some of the tower-scoring buildings to be overpowered if one player gets a stranglehold on the queen).

Wonderful game and great improvement on the Kingdomino mechanic. Offers many paths to victory. If you have King and Queendomino, you can build 7x7 kingdoms with 3 and 4 players. A really lovely game with simple mechanics and deep strategy. Superb.

Queendomino is a very simple game, I think it is going to be an abstract, city building, tile placement game. I could not say that luck does not play a big role in the playthrough but one can say that the players should really take risk management into account. Just like every game Bruno Cathala has designed, it is really well-designed. I could not say that this could act only as a filler game, nor is a gateway game (the snobs would say that) because Queendomino is designed to target somewhere in the middle between beginner and veteran.

A more advanced version of Kingdomino that adds in an entire economy with knights to gain money when you tax a contiguous area, which is then spent on building buildings which offer some immediate benefits and more end game scoring objectives. It is still fairly fast playing but it definitely feels more gamey than Kingdomino and for that reason it doesn't rate as high for me. The core puzzle of Kingdomino is still there but in this case the added elements take a little bit away for me as opposed to add. For a half hour puzzle game at this weight I would almost always reach for something like Azul. I want to try this again with 4 players to see if it's any better than with 2 before making my final decision.

My daughter bought this one at the closing down sale in a local toy shop. The timing wasn't great. We haven't had Kingdomino long and I suspect we will now play this more. Kingdomino is much simpler and more elegant. It is also in a smaller box so if it doesn't get to the table much we can use it as a travel game.

As i was popping out the coins and castle standees the cardboard laminates split, which meant i had to glue almost all the castle pieces.This did take the shine off the opening  the box for the first time. This said, only after 3 plays to date my wife and we have enjoy the game very much. with the added ways to score in the game it is oh so easy to mess up the construction of our 7x7. With queen having many  more ways to score over king it adds a lot more strategies

Although the game is more complex than Kingdomino, in some ways the decisions are simpler. For example, you'll almost always select a domino with a red square if one is available.

Nice, more complex version of Kingdomino.  The base game is there, but with the addition of an economy.  Knights are deployed to draw taxes, which are invested into buildings, which add powers/points.  Room for both, but gamers would probably want to head straight here, bypassing the original game.

RATING: 8
Adds one more terrain type to Kingdomino, but that's a BIG change since the buildings can only be built on the new terrain.  Add knights, taxes, towers, a dragon and a queen and suddenly you have a gamer's version of Kingdomino.   Would always want to play this version with gamers.   Would always want to go with Kingdomino for families, however.   Like the other game, the 2p version of this in the 7x7 grid is the best way to go.

I'll enjoy a bit more Kingdomino for sure.

Queendomino is very good evolution of Kingdomino. On Kingdomino's domino-tile-laying foundation, it adds a mechanism to generate income (tax collecting knights) and things to purchase with this income (buildings that generate victory points in various ways). It's an easy teach to players familiar with Kingdomino. I gave Kingdomino a 9, because of its enjoyable versatility due to its simplicity (I can play it with my mom and in-laws). I think that Queendomino is not as versatile, because of its added complexity, but I enjoy it very much with other prepared players.

Note that creating high scoring territories (squares and crowns) is still the heart of the game; knights and buildings simply open a  competitive path.

Where Kingdomino is just a bit too simple, Queendomino goes too far the other direction. On paper the additional mechanics roused my enthusiasm, but in practice Queendomino proves how much more 'less' can be. The three new mechanics (building, taxing, and Queen-control) add an incredible amount of drag to what was originally a breezy game. The decisions they invoke are not very complex, nor rewarding, but they slow the game down to an excruciating crawl. While I wasn't particularly fond of Kingdomino, Queendomino triples the rules overhead while offering very little reward.

There are some nice ideas with the new buildings (and building sites) but it will slow down the whole game and makes "counting" much more complicated...

Not bad, but absolute not necessary... I'll stay with Kingdomino.

QUEENDOMINO ist bei genauerer Betrachtung eigentlich ein Upgrade von KINGDOMINO, das der Trommler des Königs auf dem Marktplatz auch als Erweiterung hätte ausrufen können. So bekommt der König seine Königin in neuer Großschachtel geliefert. Der komplexverwöhnte Vielspieler, dem KINGDOMINO als Konsens für alle noch zu sehr Nicht-Spiel und Pipifax war, darf sich spätestens mit QUEENDOMINO mit der hübschen Kreation anfreunden, die vor allem in Haptik und Material eine Kinderseelenwelt zum Leben erweckt. QUEENDOMINO hat neben den bekannten Landschaftslegeplättchen aus KINGDOMINO auch zu bebauende Gebäudefelder mit Türmen, eine Auslage mit Gebäuden und Ritter zur Münzgeldbeschaffung, denn Gebäude kosten Geld. Der Drache für Anfänger von Daenerys Tagaryen vernichtet Gebäude, die Mitspieler gut brauchen könnten und die Queen macht selbige wiederum einen Märchentaler billiger. Alles in allem ist QUEENDOMINO das Gute aus KINGDOMINO mit bekannten Aperçus, die Neueinsteiger in die Brettspielwelt ganz sanft an höhere Weihen heranführen. Beide Spiele lassen sich übrigens vermengen zu einem Gesamtwerk. QUEENDOMINO zeigt, dass ein schlichtes, einfaches Gemüt nicht automatisch langweilig sein muss. Darin und in seinem Wesen ist QUEENDOMINO sehr lieb. Wir warten auf PRINCEDOMINO.

Use your money to buy buildings until it is time to get more money. Use your Knights to provide 3 coins or more. The Queen helps you buy Buildings. Do not forget the 1-coin rebate!
Hopefully some of your buildings has also given you more Knights to keep your Knights-Money-Building engine alive. If your engine runs out, you are smoked!
Use the Dragon when you have money and go early in the round, and your later-going competitors are located on Town tiles. This will make it more expensive for them to buy the favorable buildings. You may not use the Dragon when you possess the Queen. Destroy their chances to get more Knights if you can.
In my only learning 4-p game, the guy with the most Towns won. The guy coming last got some grubble in the Knights-Money-Building engine.

A spectacular upgrade from Kingdomino! Where Kingdomino was extremely accessible and easily able to teach to new players, Queendomino definitely steps the game up and peppers the board with a few more details to add to your end-game point total. 

With the addition of the Queen, a dragon, knights, and new red tiles that you can build stuff on, planning and strategy in Queendomino is on a much deeper level than its predecessor. 

The ability to combine both games together for a 4-player 7x7 Kingdom grid is also a fantastic feature! For anyone who has Kingdomino, I cannot recommend this enough. If you don't own Kingdomino, Queendomino is the better of the two and absolutely stands on its own legs. Begin building your kingdom!

Queendomino is a domino style building game much like its predecessor. Unfortunately, how it adds new elements, takes away the fun and quick accessibility of Kindgomino. The additions of taxing land tiles to gain income during the game and building special building tiles is fine, but isn't fleshed out enough to be interesting nor is it light enough to fit in with the current game. Queendomino is not a poor game, bur it feels handicapped by its connection with Kingdomino. Instead of adding to Kingdomino's strengths, mechanics were added that feel piled on.

Kingdomino with added complexity:
- 7x7grid, which feels good to gamers!
- collect money (=1 land size) through knights
- spend money to buy buildings (or 1$ to destroy a building)
- build buildings on new red terrain only
- buildings give extra points (straight or per knight/tower/terrains of type X)
- Queen joins the side with most towers, for -1 cost on buildings and anextra crown at the end of the game.
=> Game length now ~1h.

Not sure I want / don't want this. Would the extra complexity work for my not-so-gamers group? It's a waste to get this and Kingdomino, though.

While you were rewarded for good connections in Kingdomino, in Queendomino you profit from separating tiles from each other. I don't like that and I don't think that I need it. I'll keep Kingdomino and kick Queendomino out.

Great game, but rating lower than Kingdomino. Kingdomino is clever and elegant. This adds some stuff on top of that, which is welcome for some circiumstances - I play this with my gamer friends when I want a deeper experience. However, the added mechanics make the game less versatile and longer - and while the new mechanics are good, they're not as mind-blowingly clever as the core Kingdomino mechanic.

I liked the simplicity of Kingdomino, so I bought this one. It's the same with some added complexity, which is nice. If you're just a casual Kingdomino player, you don't need this. It seems that the new stuff only adds a few extra points to your score, and the best strategy is still to have big chunks of land.

Queendomino is gamers' Kingdomino. The framework is the same. New are buildings that can be erected on a new type of field and a monetary system including knights to earn money for purchasing these buildings. Essentially, a second layer is introduced and with it tradeoff decisions.

It's a decent game but the secondary building system is not interesting enough with money being abundant and rather generic building effects. Elements like the towers and the dragon appear like afterthoughts without much impact on gameplay. Kingdomino was perfect as a quick filler for gamers and nongamers alike. Queendomino is good but doesn't stand out in the difficult domain of gateway games. Its most memorable characteristic is the outstanding but hopelessly overproduced tile tower.

Plays just like Kingdomino with more path to victory with the Queen, knights and those red tiles that can score in multiple ways. I would definitely play this game more than Kingdomino with most people that plays board games.  The components are fantastic and the game is still relatively cheap in price as well.

RATING: 6.5
Overall, the additions (when compared to Kingdomino) muddy and dillute what was a perfectly crafted system. I feel like this achieves what you want it to (Kingdomino, but heavier) on paper, but where it fails is (a) the fact that the additional color dilutes everything else, but more importantly (b) what those buildings do, which pulls you in the opposite direction from what the game is about.

This one surprised me. Kingdomino was elegant, easy to teach game... Queendomino is something else. A lot of small components and a bit fiddly tiles - it will take couple of games before you get into it. Queendomino is still fast to play, but my first feeling is, that the game went to totally wrong direction. I've played original Kingdomino over 20 games, but I'm already sure, that same isn't going to happen with Queendomino.

I guess people are going to be divided on this one. Those who find Kingdomino perfect will find it unnecessarily complex. THose, like me, who found Kingdomino good but a bit too bland and too simple, might enjoy Queendomino more - if they like the typical Eurogame approach it uses. The most innovative part of the game is still the Kingdomino ruleset, as the additions are pure JASE stuff so some might have problems with these as well. I don't know, I like it way more than before. Extra buildings with a number of special scoring options that have an effect on your other choices as well; collecting tax, collecting towers for the queen, all good additions for me. I like it.

RATING: 9
It's a fantastic game. Queendomino adds another level of complexity to the very simple and fast Kingdomino and, in my opinion, it totally works! Some new mechanics and combos to explore, but nothing too complicated or time-consuming. Yes, the game is no longer a filler. The box is much bigger and although it still plays fast, it runs a bit longer than the King version. Does it bother me? Absolutely not. I never even really saw Kingdomino as a filler, to be honest. I really love Queendomino and all the new strategies it brings to block and defeat your opponents, which is something I felt was lacking in Kingdomino: conflict. Sure, you could block tiles to prevent the opponent of getting them, but from all the games I've played I came to the conclusion that, most times, you aren't really paying attention to what he is doing in his kingdom and are more likely concerned and busy with your own kingdom. Queendomino forces you to pay attention to your opponents kingdom, and I love that. I read a lot of bad reviews and I have to say I don't get them. "It overcomplicates a game that is supposed to be simple and fast, too many things going on" - it still IS simple and fast, we're not talking about Agricola for God's sake! (I love Agricola by the way!). If you liked Kingdomino but felt it was too simple or boring, and love a little board game conflict now and then, this is a must buy.

Kingdomino & Queendomino are my tile laying games of choice and fit slightly different slots in my collection.

Kingdomino is the game I can play with almost anybody (even my 6 year old).  The rules are straightforward and the strategies are simple.  There are no small components and the tiles are thick so it's also good for playing outside.  The small box makes it easy to travel with.

Queendomino is definitely a step up in complexity and I wasn't sure how to feel about it after my first couple of plays.  However, once I was bit more familiar with the building tiles, I realized the few additional rules make for a more interesting game.  The addition of the building tiles offers more strategic options.  Now, when you're grabbing land tiles, you're considering whether to take a tile that adds to a large scoring area or maybe you need another town spot to build a particular building that will give you a guard, tower, or end game scoring bonus.  It adds in money, which gives you a resource you have to manage throughout the game.  Normally, games in this weight range tend to be too simple and lose their luster after just a couple of games, but so far, Queendomino is still standing strong and is something I look forward to playing more.

Overall, both games have a spot in my collection and I plan to pick up expansions as they come out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.921
Definitely takes Kingdomino into a more gamers' game. It offers more choices and gives the game more replay value. The building tiles and the different buildings provide more choices for VPs and allow for more strategies for the game. It does however, make the game a little more cutthroat (with the Dragon). 
Recommend for people looking for an advanced option of Kingdomino. But for people that like the lighter game, or that have it to play with non-gamers or children, I would stick to the original and not worry about this sequel.

I never played Kingdomino since it looked too simplistic. Friend advertised this as the meatier version, so I gave it a try.

Pros: Like the visuals (tiles, queen and dragon, towers and knights). Like the tile-choosing affecting order of next round's turn and the building of the 5x5 grid is ok (i.e. the kingdomino part).

Cons: There was definitely a strong luck aspect of the player order + follow-up draw.
The buildings seem really over-powered... a weak choice is still going to give you 4 points at end of game (comparatively, a regular square does well if it scores 3 points), and they're not really costly either (especially once have queen, which becomes snowball effect). Accumulation of money also becomes absurd (one player easily taxed for >10 coins repeatedly, because of all the bonuses for towers, knights, etc).
The dragon doesn't really accomplish much since many tiles are good for a player... so often not worth eliminating A because B is just as good for them (maybe costs 2 coins more than A, but you spent 1 coin to use dragon... and B will shift cheaper next round anyhow).

This game was an odd mix of simplicity (the kingdomino part) and more complex parts (kind of a weird combination of mechanisms), so I did wonder who the audience is (i.e. too complex for kids now...). It was reasonably fun but I probably wouldn't seek it out.

Even though this is a standalone game, it is mainly to - obviously - pair up with Kingdomino. And it's a worthy addition, this is simply gamer's Kingdomino. Not as elegantly simple as its older brother (or should I say husband?), but the new terrain - towns and its buildings to purchase - give the chance to create some more things to think about and impressive combos. And the possibility to mix Royaldominoes up and play in 6 (in fact, I still think 7 would be possible, too) is great!

Loved Kingdomino immediately so picked this up as an "expansion" of sorts to be able to play with more players.  Tried this out and it adds a lot of depth to the original mechanics of the game, which took us a few turns to get the hang of.  I feel like I will go back to the original for awhile until (if?) that seems lacking in something, then go back to this.  Much harder with more territory types to try to shove into even a 7x7 grid!

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I resisted playing Queendomino because all the talk surrounding it was this is the "gamers" version of Kingdomino and I wasn't sure I was interested in a more complex version of Kingdomino. Part of the Kingdomino's charm was just how smooth and quick it played and while Queendomino adds a few new elements to the game it is still a light game that [i]should[/i] play quickly.

The big addition to Queendomino are the towns on which you can later build a building. The buildings will usually offer a combination of end game scoring opportunities, knights [i](placed on the board to collect money)[/i] and/or towers [i](used to attract the queen, who will count as an extra crown in the region she resides in)[/i]. I enjoy how these elements give you a few more things to contemplate when deciding what you want to do and they also open up the scoring a bit. However; this addition could induce AP with some folks because you now have to place a tile and then evaluate the buildings and see if you want to build one. I can imagine some folks freezing up and dragging this beyond a 20 to 30 minute game and killing the fun. 

In the end I still prefer Kingdomino over Queendomino because it is such an elegant design. Kingdommino is simple and easy to play and yet it there is a subtle depth to the spacial puzzle that I continually enjoy figuring out. You can literally teach anyone Kingdomino in a matter of minutes and they will have the rules down. I would compare Queendomino to Carcassonne in terms of weight and difficulty. At this point I would recommend Queendomino over Carcassonne because the rules are more intuitive and it plays quicker while still offering similar strategic depth as Carcassonne. I would recommend checking out Queendomino, there is enough added to the game to justify having both games in your collection.[/i]

Based on one play: The tile purchase really adds to the strategy versus Kingdomino. You basically just draw a tile each turn and place it domino like in a 5 by 5 grid however now you can purchase special locations to place on your tiles when you place a red domino. This changes it up enough that I actually prefer it as it adds another layer to the simple domino placing which was cute but not exciting.

This adds considerably more complexity to the super-simple Kingdomino and, consequently, a fair amount of time.

I liked Kingdomino, but traded it away because after a few plays I felt like I had seen all it had to offer. Queendomino definitely had my curiosity up. The new feature is that there are now red type spots on the tiles, and when you have a red spot you can buy a castle square tile to put on it which can give you some ongoing benefit. It's a nice improvement, although the square city tiles are a little fliplucky and your ability to get them is dependent on them actually coming up when you have the chance to grab them in the tile selection phase. Generally I liked this though. I would play more, although I'm on the fence about if I want to own my own copy or not.

I was initially wary of Queendomino, thinking it was adding way too much and going to ruin the simple brilliance that is Kingdomino. Luckily I was partially wrong--Queendomino is a worthy game in its own right. 

Queendomino is much more of a light-mid weight Euro game though, for those Euro fans. Kingdomino is very much a lighter German family game, or a super light Euro. As long as you know your crowd and what they like, Queendomino can be a fun alternative. 

The building and taxing mechanics don't take too long to work out, although valuing the buildings seems a bit tough at first. Our early games saw some huge leads from some combo'd buildings. Will be interesting to explore more from time to time, although I think Kingdomino is a better german family game than Queendomino is Euro game.

A Kingdomino az egyszerűségével vett le a lábamról. Féltem a több szabállyal rendelkező utódtól, hogy egy jól működő egyszerű játékból túl bonyolultat csinál, amivel elveszti az egész a báját. Szerencsére nem ez történt, bár a játék mindenképpen nehezebb, de nem annyival, amivel romlana az összkép. Az alapjáték annyival bővül, hogy adott alapból nem értékes területre épületeket tudunk felhúzni, amik különböző módon adnak plusz pontokat, plusz egy-egy területet megadóztathatunk, amivel annyi pénzt szerzünk, amekkora a terület nagysága és ebből tudunk vásárolni. A játék továbbra is jól működik, legalább ugyanannyira tetszett, mint az egyszerű előd, később, több játék után talán el is döntöm melyik jobban, most ugyanannyi pontot adok rájuk.

Much better than Kingdomino.  Which makes it...just okay.  The basic game, the same as Kingdomino, is players take turn drafting dominoes with different terrain types on them and build a tableau of those tiles in front of them.  The goal is to get the largest connected terrain area with the most crowns printed on them.

What Queendomino adds is a building market and dominoes can include construction spaces where these buildings will be placed when bought.  They give different additional scoring opportunities or award you towers or knights.  Knights are used to tax terrain for more money (used to buy the buildings) and tower majority will award you with the queen meeple which will allow you to add a crown to any terrain area at game end.

it's a pretty good quality game, especially for the price of a smaller box game.  There is a decent amount here for people looking for a lighter weight and quick game.  The dominoes are really thick and have decent art on them.  For a lighter and quicker game it is really good.  For all the other times I'd rather play something richer.

Similar to Kingdomino in tile selection, but there are a few more mechanisms in order to make your realm more valuable, including money as a resource, and a dragon for eliminating buildings that you don't want your opponent to get, or as a way of cycling the offer.

RATING: 4.5
This is a lesson on how to take the game of the year 2017 (renowned for it's elegant design) and turn it into a convoluted mess. All the additions have the Cathala trademark but feel out of place thrown in together.

Your turn went from place a tile, pick a new tile (Kingdomino) to place a tile, place a knight, buy a building tile, activate the dragon, pick a new tile (Queendomino). There's also cash and towers added and a Queen meeple with a special power.

To me Bruno evacuated to much of the original to make place for red tiles and their bland scoring method (also a scoring pad is big red light that your scoring is convoluted!). I can't imagine gamers being that much more interested in this version. It's also now out of reach of casuals so it sit in a weird place. I think Blue Orange have given too much carte blanche to Cathala on this and he went overboard with it.

Like Kingdomino, it's a good game with a fun central mechanic of drafting tiles.  It has a short playing time, easy to understand rules, and satisfying scoring mechanics.  The new building mechanic adds some nice choices to the game, though I'm not sure I prefer it over Kingdomino's elegant simplicity.  It's the kind of game I'd gladly play, but I'm unlikely to suggest it.

This felt like the Machi Koro problem for me.  The expansion takes what was great about Kingdominio and takes that away.  In this case it the simple and quick time Kingdomino takes.  I don't have any issue with the game mechanisms, I actually liked them, but all 4 players kept just wanting to take the tiles and place them, skipping the revenue and buying phases.  In the end, don't need to own

Un gioco semplice ma certamente non scontato, ha una discreta profondità tattica, l'interazione è di tipo indiretto e si sente, sopratutto con il meccanismo del Drago che serve a togliere edifici utili all'avversario. Molto bello da vedere sul tavolo, i materiali sono buoni e il costo è contenuto. Adatto ai casual gamers ma anche a chi cerca un gioco leggero e dalla durata contenuta ma non per questo banale.

Great addition to the Kingdomino line. Just a few more choices to make and struggle over, but gives you ways to get points if you’re stuck getting too many tiles that aren’t useful.

Fantastic game!

RATING: 8.5
Not quite as streamlined as Kingdominio, but equally as enjoyable. There are significantly more decisions to make and much more mental load. The buildings add a nice alternative scoring mechanism to the game that brings an extra challenge.

The production quality if amazing. The dragon meeple is absolutely adorable even if we don’t find much use in it because we’re not malicious players.

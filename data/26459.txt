RATING: N/A
Read Alister Maclean's book HMS Ulysses in high school, and been fascinated with the subject. It's why I also bought SWWAS:Arctic Convoy.

The rules were pretty dense when I first read them, and so have not yet tried the game, but it looks fantastic, and holds great promise for me. Since getting back into games, my brain seems to be freeing up, so I will have another look at this because the subject really interests me.

I'll probably get to Arctic Convoy first, because the rules are simpler, and I can play the other games I have in the series without having to learn much extra.

Very good game with an emphasis on narration. 
You will not see massive sea battles with dozens of capital ships burst into flame. Here, you'll be glad if you sink several merchant ships with your submarines or if your destroyers identify a wolfpack and prevent an attack on a convoy.
That being said, this is a very enjoyable game. Some might find it frustrating. You'll spend most of your time trying to identify ennemy forces, launching an attack is difficult, and damaging ships is no easy task.
The game is full of uncertainty because of hidden ennemy units, detection mechanics, changing weather conditions. That's  not to say there is no strategy involved. You'll have to organize your convoys and their escorts, plan the refuel, evaluate the risks before involving your capital ships, deceive your opponent.
The gameplay is flowing once you have assimilated the rules (which are no easy read)

Un planteamiento atrevido para un wargame. Combina mecánicas relativamente modernas (bloques, cartas y niebla de guerra) con un teatro muy poco plasmado en el hobby.

La apuesta (para mí) se queda a medias con buenas cosas pero otras realmente malas. Empiezo por las malas.

- El manual. Absolutamente lamentable. Un juego de esta complejidad necesita un manual claro y bien redactado. La realidad es que es enormemente ambiguo y necesita mucha consulta en BGG para aclarar un montón de aspectos.

- Embrollo. Si manejas muchas TF (caso aliado principalmente) la gestión es enorme y no precisamente intuitiva ni fácil (combustible, intercambios de barcos y muchos otros aspectos). No importaría si se ofreciera un retorno adecuado a este esfuerzo, pero es que estamos hablando en muchas ocasiones de tareas que aportan poco o nada a la partida... Obviamente esto no ayuda en un juego que ya de por sí tiene poca acción.

- Farragoso. Para algunas acciones también irrelevantes se han de consultar demasiadas tablas y realizar tiradas que al final acaban casi siempre en nada, o como mucho te dan un modificador. Creo que se tendría que haber mantenido un compromiso entre la fluidez y la simulación. Sobre todo en encuentros descompensados o irrelevantes.

- Los escenarios son demasiado parecidos todos entre sí. Convoy que va, convoy que viene o los dos. Pero la ejecución es similar, cambiando únicamente los barcos a disposición del jugador y un poco las condiciones atmosféricas. Entiendo que tampoco se puede hacer mucho al respecto, dado el teatro elegido.

- Los escenarios son largos, pero la campaña es por lo tanto enoooorme. Creo precisamente que la campaña debería haber sido el punto fuerte del juego (gestión de recursos a lo largo de 1 año de conflicto, barcos que se hunden, barcos que entran o salen, etc...) pero lo repetitivo de las operaciones y la duración hacen que uno ni se plantee intentarlo.

- Alemania dispone de unos recursos muy pobres para frenar los convoyes. Si sacas los pocos barcos grandes que tienes casi seguro que pierdes. Esto, una vez más, lo marca el teatro, pero a lo mejor el problema es precisamente la elección del mismo a la hora de diseñar el juego.

- El juego necesita dedicación. No es sencillo.

- Demasiado poca acción. Aparte de algunos ataques aéreos/submarinos no esperes mucho más. Personalmente esto me deja un poco frío (claro que en el Ártico es lo normal, ¿no?).

Ahora las buenas:

- El juego es bonito y los materiales son correctos. No recuerdo demasiadas erratas y sólo en el manual (las omisiones y ambigüedades ya son otra cosa...)

- Es original. No debe ser fácil aplicar nuevas mecánicas y aquí al menos se intenta explorar opciones más allá de lo de siempre.

- Es una simulación muy minuciosa del tema de los convoyes a Rusia. Si eres un apasionado del tema, probablemente te gustará.

- Tal vez esta serie llevada a otro teatro brille más. Pero claro, ya se ha comenzado con mal pie y costará recuperar la confianza del grognard.

Like several other recent GMT games, this is really more of a narrative generator than a game. You throw some units on to a mission, you don't make a ton of choices, but the game plays out in interesting ways. Hopefully.

The problem is, the narrative the game produces is boring and seems to involve mostly flipping cards, looking at charts, and searching rules. You play for 4-6 hours to do two convoys (simultaneously one going, one returning), and just not a lot happens. You spend a ton of time rolling for weather and random events and making search draws or storm/ice damage draws, and you get maybe one or two interesting confrontation. This game desperately needed some sort of time telescoping so that you don't play out the boring parts of the convoy mission at the same pace as the exciting bits. PQ-17 makes sort of a half-hearted attempt with the plotting, but it doesn't really work.

It also really needed someone to take a hatchet to the complexity. Given the choices and excitement it generates, this game is simply far too complicated, which, combined with a horrendously bad rulebook and a number of fairly severe usability problems, is a fatal blow. The fuel subsystem is a good example. The Allies have to do a *ton* of planning and work to plot out when their escorts have to cycle for almost zero game payoff. The fuel system manages to be both too complicated and yet also abstract enough to have substantial holes that need to be gamed, and it almost would have been easier to have fuel boxes for each and every ship. The problem is, not only is PQ-17 over-complicated as a game, but significant chunks of it either don't really work or are inherently incredibly confusing.

Like too many recent GMT games, this is an absolutely great topic for a game which is killed by under-development, gratuitous complexity, a terrible rulebook, and an unwillingness to make any concession to game playability in pursuit of some non-existent simulation value. Complex for no purpose, long to no end (there is about a half an hour worth of game in a 6 hour package), this is not "a grognard game" or "for people who like historical details" or "for people who prefer narrative over balance" - this is just not a good game.

It's not as bad as 1805: Sea of Glory, though. And the rules do have an index. I think there is actually a game in the PQ-17 box which could at least theoretically be played and enjoyed by some. But for me, I'll stick with Downtown for this sort of thing.
---
Another absolutely horrendous set of rules from GMT. I don't think this game is actually that complicated, but the rule book is completely opaque and incomprehensible, and I am stunned that simple professional self-respect would not prevent a designer or company from producing something this bad. By my count, this is the third rulebook in the past year or so published by GMT that has really redefined the floor on rulebook quality (Pursuit of Glory, Fields of Fire, and now PQ-17). MMP routinely churns out mediocre rulebooks - The Devil's Cauldron was particularly frustrating - but they've got absolutely nothing on these games.

Anyway, tried the learning scenario once, seemed like the game might have potential. A little fiddly, doesn't seem like there are a ton of real choices, but evocative. I'd definitely like to give it another try with something resembling correct rules.

RATING: N/A
I think the game presents an excellent idea - using blocks to recreate the difficulty of finding and engaging enemy naval forces, coupled with quite a sophisticated reconnaisance system.

Sadly, I can't play it solo and it's a bit too long and complex to teach for a one-shot session.

Good system, with much to commend it, in particular the searching mechanism. However, from the games that I've played, there's just no real excitement in play. The convoys must pass through the narrow gap between the North Cape and the arctic ice, and it seems that it's just a matter of the German throwing everything he has at his target every turn. There's no real decision making, though I suspect that a campaign game would force the Allies to take some more difficult decisions about force commitment.

I want to see how the proposed Norway 1940 expansion works out, as I see that situation as having far more potential.

Preordered and highly anticipated!

UPDATE: In a word- Impressive. Probably too much of a good thing for all but the most keen on this operation. Fortunately for me, I fall into that category. 

I had been reading books on the Battle of the Atlantic as well as the Murmansk Convoys when I saw the game appear on the P500. This only motivated me to read more on the subject. Now that the game is here and I sit down to get started, I find the rules just a tad intimidating. However, I'm also realizing that it's not quite so complicated as it seems. Once you play through the sequence it all starts to fall together. Rating is very tentative and based on my initial dabblings with the game system- it's sure to change.

I'm excited by this game as a the first of a new series. Later games in the series will probably have an even greater appeal to a wider audience. Chris is a designer to watch closely.

I'm sure there is a good game in there, but someone to demonstrate that game would be appreciated.  While there are so many other games that haven't hit my table, I couldn't help but question the effort necessary to learn this one. I've muddled through difficult rule books before but in this case comprehension has completely eluded me. I'll wait for a detailed video, perhaps the designer showing interested players at a convention? Or at least a rule book with more precision. This rating is my first impression with many hours of effort invested. Hopefully one day I'll get a better handle on a nice looking effort.

RATING: 6
Third play, revised rating down to a six.

I'm baffled by Randy Heller's comment that the game is hideously complex (with a rating of two!). The rules aren't always presented as well as possible, but the aids in the downloads section here fix that. The stupendous Extended Expanded Sequence of Play simply covers every possible action and makes sure that there are not questions about, well, sequencing. Including every single step of the surface combat procedure make the SoP look hideously complicated, but you're going to skip it completely almost every single turn, so who cares?

I found that this third game played very fast and easily. (separated by many months from the first game and a few months from the second game). PQ-17 certainly does require a lot more planning and care in setup than people players are used to, which can be a big turn-off. If you set up plans before the game, it's much more enjoyable. It's easy to make all of your plans ahead of time because of the limited number of units.

Is there a there there? Not sure. In this third game, I actually got to make some critical decisions as the Germans. On the other hand, the Murmansk-bound convoy got away scott-free because of weather draws, recon draws, and bad contact rolls. There wasn't much of anything that I could have done to influence the outcome. I also tried to draw out the Allies by faking the Kirkenes convoy, but that failed completely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Apart from the fiddly written instruction, PQ-17 has everything I demand from the naval wargame. Fog od war, weather and combat mechanics melt into one coherent piece. Be warned though, that some knowledge is required. Without it, narrative produced within the game might be hard to believe. Another thing worth noticing is a distinctive character of conflict - few hours could be spend without making any sinks or without even making a potential conflict. It's more a game of bluff or strategy than a game of tactical decisions. Bearing these hesitations in mind, I consider PQ-17 as a masterpiece in wargaming.

Finally I got a hand on this great game! No ranking at the moment. I have to play a few times to say something more. 

EDIT: After just one play I give this game a 9. I hesitated between 9 and 10 but the memory of the horrific rulebook helped me to make my decision. 

This is one of the best Wargames that I have ever played. Complex and very intense. Chris Janiec did a terrific job when designing this game because when you actually look at all its details you just start to feel the nature of this epic WWII episode. Weather, ice conditions, fuel impact, torpedoes, all the historical vessels - you have it all in just one box. 

Great game!

[b]Thank you, Santa Grogs![/b]

[i]Holy cow[/i] I'm having a tough time learning this one.  I rarely bother reading extended examples of play, relying instead on the [i]rules,[/i] but for this game, there were some pretty important concepts which I couldn't understand from the rules alone.  The first scenario, PQ-6, has one big fleet which I think? you never use in that scenario (and whose setup raised at least three rules questions); a small task force which you lose VPs for using (and so which I think? you never use in that scenario?); having a PQ-6-tutorial scenario stripped down to the essential units would have been really helpful.  (Compare to Red Winter, which has a 15-minute scenario with just a few units on each side, and which explains what you need to know for each turn.  [i]That's[/i] how you make a game you want people to play!)

I feel like there's a relatively simple game hiding in that rulebook somewhere, and I'm going to find it, dammit.

GMT block wargame about the arctic convoys in the middle of WWII. 

This hidden gem is let down by badly edited rules (they are simultaneously vague and attempting to cover some very obscure corner cases) and play aids that don't really support the flow of the game.

But when you look past the shortcomings, this is a wonderfully tense game with a well implemented fog of war mechanism.

And, of course, the subject matter is riveting stuff. PQ-17 tells the same quality stories as The Burning Blue

Still reading the rules. So far I'm enjoying it and the rules seem altogether not too complicated. The combat examples can take a little extra concentration because acronyms are used which one can easily look up in the rule book and a chart or two needs to be referenced, which takes only a small amount of extra effort. I'm already feeling the chill of the arctic and smelling the salt in the air!

Campaign is brilliant, each campaign scenario or fortnight, as they are called, is playable in a single session. Forces are very asymmetrical, so you have to think about strategy with each side. You have to plan ahead, there aren't too many opportunities for reaction.

Searching mechanism creates an additional element of fog of war. Most of the turns you cannot locate anything and that is good. 

Rules as written are a bit obtuse. Individual scenarios aren't that interesting.

Engaging hide and seek game.  Many details involved per turn give it a tense feel as the hopes of "something happening" keeps players maneuvering.  Combination of blocks with die cut counters and a battle map gives it a layered feel.  A few complete turns are needed to understand it all as the rules slowly come together.  Will play it again in hopes of grasping it all.  Not too sure about the "Decision at Sea Series" becoming a reality as volume one is the only one so far!

Love the look of this game but cannot find anybody to play it with me. Also, the more I look at the map, the more I see that most games will play the same (ie convoys will take the same route). I hope this isn't true but may never find out. 

As time goes on my hope of ever playing this game dwindles. To bad too because the components are beautiful. The fact that it is a fog of war block game means I will never be able to play it solo. For Trade, excellent condition.

Stepped through some of the mechanics on a playtest copy.  I like the search mechanics and how units can gain/lose identity depending on various actions.  Resonants very nicely with theme.  Battle also appears to be quite good.  At this stage of development - lots of charts to review - but expecting that the final production will add items like player reference shields to both hide convey/task force information and make the information a bit easier to find as the overall game is streamlined for production.

RATING: 9
(Disclaimer: I was a playtester.)  This is a naval/air system that pulls off the difficult feat of limited intelligence without resorting to double-blind or simultaneous plotted movement.  The systems for reconnaissance, detection, and ID level (how accurate and "fresh" your intelligence is) are brilliant and easy to use.

I'm of the opinion that nothing in this game is more complex than it needs to be, but the situation requires a collection of relatively simple systems to interact in a way that adds up to some complexity.

The various convoy scenarios have the potential to be the same, and the potential to be quite different, depending on random events and player temperament.  You won't find many slam-bang carrier or surface battles here, unlike the Med or the Solomons (volumes 2 and 3 of Decision at Sea, still to come).  What you *will* find is the feeling of constantly being on the edge of disaster.  It feels GOOD to get the convoy through intact (if you're the Allies), or to savage it without losing your fleet in the process (if you're the Germans).

- Complicated marker shuffling in regard to fuel. Effect can be quite unrealistic. Should either be made easier, or a system implemented where fuel is measured per ship counter.
- Lots of player action resulting in another "didn't find each other", so no fights in the entire scenario.

A great light game. Very few rules, no wrong answers. I was beaten by a five-year-old girl tonight, and she'd never played before. She simply had a keen sense of what other people would say in answer to a few specific questions.

The game doesn't play very well by the rules...or with strangers.  But if you throw out the board, have some close friends over, and write the rudest answers possible, the game is a riot!

This is one of the most poorly designed games I've ever played.  If you play this game to "win" you probably won't have any fun.  If you play this game with a creative group of people and just try to be funny you can have about as much fun as humanly possible with this game.  Use every question as a set-up and write you own punchlines and you'll be dying of laughter every round.  One of my favorite board game experiences.

RATING: 1.5
Apples to Apples... except its Clunky/Fiddly/Slow/Boring/Etc (collecting and distributing papers, stopping to write...either answers or to guess who's who..), nothing to really get excited about... No real correct answers... and so the time it takes to formulate them drains any excitement or fun out of them...

Of course we might not have been playing by the right rules... I don't think this game could be that much fun even with the right rules...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Although this game may favor a player who knows the others more, it is still somewhat enjoyable.  The questions provoke a lot of conversation which is always a good thing.  The one drawback is that the dice-rolling can often have a greater effect on who wins and loses than the actual gameplay.  Some house rules can remedy that, but they should have eliminated that effect in the play testing.

Doesn't play well with too large of a group.  Some of the questions are dumb, BUT if you start allowing people to skip a card because the questions are dumb you can wait a long time while they start searching through the card for a question they really like (please never use this house rule - it sucks).  If you allow the group to get a little raunchy then can be a raucous time.

Pretty good. Only works with exactly 5 or 6; more is so long it's torture, and less and it's too easy to guess. Lot of variance in the quality of the questions, so we play the questioner can move to the next card if they don't like the question.

Loaded Questions used to be my favorite game. The questions let you learn things about people, and usually end up with us laughing so hard we are crying. It is more about the laughing than the winning.
We don't use the board anymore, because it is much too long. Recently we started using the rules to a copy-cat game called "Things" and we like those rules even better. Instead of one person doing all of the guessing on their turn, we let each player guess until they get one wrong, then it goes around the room, so each person gets a chance for points each round. That makes it an even better game.

A decent party game, but felt like the game length was a bit too long for my tastes.  The game will depend to a large extent on how well you know the other players, as guessing who wrote which answer becomes easier the more you know about someone.  So having a mixed group (close friends, and not so close friends) actually makes it more interesting since you can't narrow it down quite as easily as if you knew all players very well.

RATING: 6
This is a decent party game that accommodates up to 6 players.  There is a roll and move aspect and short cuts if you happen to land on specific spaces which increases the randomness.  That being said this is a party game so winning is less important than just laughing at the things people will write down and see how your friend matches the answers of the questions to the people playing.  The most negative thing I could say about the game is that at the end, you have to guess players answers correctly.  I could see this sometimes causing the game to outstay it's welcome.  This also is probably not the best game to play if you are playing with perfect strangers but works pretty good for a close-knit group of friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Had potential but too many lame questions in the game we played.  I think it would work much better if the players were able to choose among the 4 possible questions on each card to avoid boring ones.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It bothers me, regardless of whether it turns up as an issue in actual gameplay, that the rules incentivize giving random answers and just making it impossible to guess who you are. Many of the questions are very boring and the game lasts too long for what it should be.

Never play with more players than recommended or you find you've have sat in a dumpster of an apartment for five hours with well meaning but creatively bereft individuals.

This is kind of Balderdash mixed with Apples to Apples. A player (judge) reads a question and all other players write their answers. The answers are then read to the judge and they guess who each answer came from. Allows players plenty of creativity (many laughs) and eliminates the "I never have any good cards" complaint.

The actual play of this game is is amazing.  We always have a blast on holidays or whenever else this one hits the table.  That said, Winning is damn near impossible.  Guessing everyone's random answers correctly by person is a huge feat.  Therein lies the problem; to win you need to match everyone's answers to the person who wrote it.  Typically, everyone gets to the end of the game and we play for a whole hour with all the pieces on the last spot trying to win.  would be a 9 or a 10 if not for this...

The answers that people give are what make this game fun.  It can be a good icebreaker when you have people over that you're getting to know, but it seems to do better when you know everyone who's playing fairly well.  I've taken this on trips and had a blast with family playing it.  The end game gets bogged down, which hurts its appeal in my mind.

This game is good enough to be worthy of the name Dominion.

This is the ultimate party game that can be played with any group, and is almost guaranteed to be a great time.

I've played it for years with countless people.

The golden unpublished rule of the game "It's like 'Whose Line is it Anyway?' the points don't matter."

House rules that help:
 * Don't write on the back of the note cards, or make any identifying marks, on the back, that might reveal whose card is whose.
 * If the same or similar answer is written down (e.g., James Kirk, and Captain Kirk.) It doesn't matter which player wrote which specific version. The guesser can switch those two, and still get it right.
 * Ignore the reversal squares. We played with them for years, and once someone almost got one right. Just treat them as normal.
 * Change the end condition to be the first person to reach the end wins. (Even by die roll.) This might feel anti-climatic if the points mattered, but they don't. Also, the original rules for this sound good, but usually just drag the game out, and it doesn't play well.
 * Any comments written in parenthesis are for the reader only, and should never be read out loud. They can be a joke, saying hello, or have useful information to help the reader like how to pronounce a word.
 * If your answer needs more than one box then circle all boxes, so the reader knows to read more than just the bottom box. This problem has come up in the past.
 * If the reader is uncertain what someone wrote down, ask the guesser to leave the room, so the reader can ask the person who wrote it down what they meant.
 * In all cases, at the end of the game, you can read any answer sheet, and it sounds like beatnik poetry. I've kept every answer sheet we've ever used as proof.

It's more interesting to play with those you don't know well (cuz you'll learn more about them), but harder to play with those you don't know well.

RATING: 8
I love this game, but you absolutely have to have the right crowd for it to go well.  Since it involves guessing who wrote what answer for VERY personal questions, you need a group where everyone knows each other roughly equally.  Also, you need people who don't get their feelings hurt easily, because guessing about personal questions can be touchy.

That said, I think the questions are great.  It's a good way of getting to know friends better, since the responses to questions often prompt funny discussions or stories from the past.

If you don't like it as a game, you can always just use the question cards for drinking games or conversations starters!

This is a good game for players who already know each other somewhat.  It gives the players a chance to get to know each other much better, often providing surprising insights even into longtime friends.

I know that some people enjoy lying or coming up with silly answers, which may have its place once in a while, but that tends to reduce my enjoyment of the game somewhat.  While a lot of the questions are silly, some may require you to really think or to bare a bit of your soul.  It's the playing, not the winning, that's the most enjoyable.

RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: The active player reads a question while everyone writes their answers secretly. The AP then assigns answers to who s/he thinks it matches. The rest is role and move stuff.

Played as: 6 player

Pros: All party games should have an element of open creativity and this one has it. You can both get to know people a little bit you didn't already and try to peg the ones you thought you did.

Cons: Most of the questions are superficial in nature so expect to only get to know people in such a way. Games with creativity require people with creativity to make them fun, and this is one of those games.

Other: I think the spirit of this game is to not be serious or even 100% truthful but to just be yourself. Played any other way and I doubt I'd ever recommend it.

Best Use: A nice party game for playful people who want to try and peg one another.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The game has potential - the idea of trying to pick who answered what is fine. The board is stupid and unnecessary: Why stick a roll-and-move game in? Just because most other 'mainstream' party games do? Why are there those 'happy trails' spaces? Are we playing snakes-and-ladders?

I think the publishers ran out of good ideas for questions early on - most of them are pathetic.

Excellent party 'get to know relatives/friends better' game.  needs to be played with the right set of people.

********  JUNE 2009 update  ***********

i continue to be impressed by this and it functions great for church classes/etc.  i think it is best to toss the board and just enjoy hearing everyone's answers / learning interesting facts about friends/acquaintances.  have one person read a question and everyone else answers.  the person to the left of the 'asker' collects the answers and reads them aloud.  the 'asker' tries to match the response with the person.  the person that collected the answers becomes the 'asker' in the next round.  play proceeds once around the table.   sure, maybe not a 'game' by definition, but a great experience and just as much a 'game' as something like Apples to Apples.

**********

clarification on the above - tossing the board also prevents the game from breaking due to a bad player experience and it also quickens the turnaround.  rounds will go about 15-30 minutes and then players can drop in / drop out for the next go around.

I enjoy this game quite a lot actually, for a party game.  I like games where you have to guess what you're friend would say.  Good for getting to know people better.

RATING: 5
The actual game part isn't bad, but allowing a person to move when they roll a die and then when they correctly guess the comment writers is ridiculous.  What this game needed was a die with the different colors on it plus a wild color where you could choose the category yourself, thereby eliminating the luck element of moving the die distance.

RATING: 6
A good get-to-know-you party game. It becomes really unbalanced when some people know each other better than others. I'd say four players is the minimum, but more than six and the game can really start to drag.

Say Anything does this concept so much better. I keep the game simply because my brother really likes it. However, I would never recommend this game for a great party game - just average.

If you actually answered the questions asked instead of using them as a template to tell jokes and make fun of each other and each others' loved ones than this game definitely wouldn't be a 10.  I think after the third hand we all concurrently stopped following the rules and instead followed our hearts.

My oldest loves this game.  Sometimes answers as hilarious.  Sometimes answers are surprising.  Why does this game have to last so long though.  Board should only be half as long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a game in the traditional sense, but an activity of "knowing" people (unless you want to throw "reading" people as the answers are read in as a skill).  Has some decent enough questions but is otherwise much in the vein of Apples to Apples and Say Anything.

Pretty standard touchy-feely party fair.  I think certain groups would shy away from the personal questions (especially if they don't use the silly board that comes with it).  Other groups would do nothing but personal stuff.

This is the best game to play with a large group of people and even better if the people do not know each other well. We always play drunk, rarely use the board to keep track of score/winners and always have fun. Gloriously inappropriate fun. I have pages and pages of answers that I never throw away. I'm actually about to run out of answer sheets!

This game becomes loads more fun when you stop answering truthfully and just come up with the most ridiculous, irreverent answers you can think of.  The person who has to read these is then in the unfortunate position of having to say out loud whatever horrible nonsense your brain can come up with.

This game used to be very fun before I got into this hobby. I then played it again about a month or so ago, and it fell absolutely flat. There's just not enough to it to hold my interest anymore. It takes forever to play, and there's not enough game there to sustain the lengthy play time. Eh.

I call this genre "party non-games".  It's an activity that is great for social gatherings, it encourages participation by everyone in a fun setting, and winning or losing isn't as important as playing the game.  It's especially good at highlighting the fact that the shyest person in your group is the one who probably knows everyone the best, and is a great conversation starter with your friends.

I bought this game as a gift for a friend, and for that I apologize.  In all honesty, I tried to get him a set of shot glasses first, but the retailer from whom I purchased it must have tried using it to crack walnuts first.  So upon the return of a box of shattered glass that they no longer had in stock, this was the next option.

On our first and hopefully only play, things started out OK.  After a few questions, it became more of a contest to see who could write the most ridiculous answers.  I think the true point of boredom was crossed when a friend started writing a flavor of "whatever it takes to end this stupid game" as an answer.  And I can't say I disagreed with him.

RATING: 5.5
This is a really fun game to play with family and friends.  The more you think you know about someone, the more interesting this game becomes.  I downgrade it because I think it goes too fast.  There aren't many spaces on the board.  We've had to make house rules where you have to go to the finish and then come back to start to try to win.

Usually fun (although there are some clunker questions), easy to learn and play, and sometimes thought-provoking.  It is best played with good-humored people that you know fairly well, and needs at least four people to work well.

It's more fun if you're loaded.  Among party games, Loaded Questions is not the best choice as an icebreaker because it plays off of intimate knowledge of other competitors.  Among good friends with a willingness to go blue, Loaded Questions is a great choice.

I discovered this while packing up things in my game box, apparently my family wants me to take it to SC!  I like to play without the board using a point system, since we always end up choosing whatever question we want anyway.  It's fun and can be wonderfully ridiculous with the right mix of people.

It's 10 assuming the right people. A close group of friends or a family make this game an inimitable experience. Some of the most fun I've ever had has been from playing this game. "Outsiders" can make this game awkward as some of them actually try to answer the questions!

Think of this game as a personalized version of Scattegories. You have the same style of cards with questions to find out about your fellow players. They write down the answer and you guess which answer matches which player. The more correct matches the more points. Interesting concept for a party game but usually needs to have a group that knows each other well enough to make the game a bit more fun and casual. That's why I rate it a '4'. I'd have to think about the situation closely before pulling out this game.

Blech.  Even for a party game, this one's pretty bad.  It's bad enough that I played it, forgot about it, and played it again without realizing it, only to be find an old play logged when I looked it up here.  Questions are boring.  Has not fared well either with a group I knew well, or a group I didn't know well at all, which is the real kiss of death for a party game.  And, in a cardinal sin for a party game, it doesn't expand beyond six players very well.  Really wouldn't recommend this at all.  If you want a game of guessing people's answers, go with [gameid=163].  If you want a game to get to know your friends better, go for [gameid=2750].

My favorite party game, hands down. It's always fun and amusing to see what people write, and it actually makes a better icebreaker than I would've thought. The only real downside is that if everyone except one or two people knows everyone else really well, it's a little awkward for those people, but if you have a group of people who all know each other or don't really know each other, it's a great social lubricant.

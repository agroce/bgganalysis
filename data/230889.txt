This is an action packed and exciting arena game which draws on a rich setting and background to provide an engaging play experience.
It's amazing now, and will be even better in 2018 when the expansions are available!

Limited edition (with foil cards - no metal minis) with extra dice pack and Maximus 'Thermoppylae' metal minature - for me combines the best of worlds...love the dice and actions it can give (similar to Star Wars Imperial Assault), the card play is good, and combined with minis in a tactical style play - looking forward to more unique teams for this game.

I saw this at Gencon and really liked it.  It does play fast and easy. I do wonder about how replayable it is.

Played a demo, not bad.  Print could be bigger.  Also, multiple symbols on dice and combinations can slow the game down - but it is fast in it's own rights.  Not too many fiddly components.  Try before you buy (as of 11/08/2017).

RATING: 10
This game carries a fabulous balance of complexity of choice vs simple mechanics. Your team of 4 characters, which you may freely chose from current 8 and a future expansions, allows you to customize your team to your own playstyle and explore many different synergies. While many games that rely on combos and set-ups quickly devolve into wind-up toy, Aristeia! still maintains a level of suspense and effort to pull-off the combos and synergy because of the rewarding decisions you need to make in balancing objectives, fighting and responding to your opponents decisions. Aristeia! has tremendous replay value afforded from its open team building, different scenarios, and healthy options of abilities to all characters.

Secret Cabal (Jamey and Steve) liked this combat/skirmish game, and compared it to Overwatch. Will there be expansions? Perhaps not a lot of variation in the map.

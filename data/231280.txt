RATING: 7.5
A surprisingly nice little Roll & Write filler game that uses a clever market mechanism to determine the scores.  You really do need to keep a close eye on your competitors and try to manipulate the market.  Easily accessible with quick turns and a some light decisions.  I liked it.

Such a fun, cute little game! I saw it at PAX Unplugged and did a demo and the first round I knew I wanted to own it. 

I love the sheets and the dice and the adorable Pip the Pig that came with the game by buying it at the convention!! 

My favorite count so far has been 3 people, since you get “more” veggies, in a way, but I’ve had a great time at both 3 and 4. I can’t wait to try 2!!

Really satisfying roll and write game. The tradeoff between feeding your pig and planting more veggies (which, of course, tend to drive the price of other veggies up - realism!) is excellent.

Nagyon jópofa, egyszerű kis filler, igazi strandjáték, amit bárhova magunkkal lehet vinni és előkapni egy partira. Egyszerűsége ellenére azért van benne döntés, bár nyilván nem optimalizálható agyon, de egy 15 perces játéknál ezt remélem, senki se várja el. :)

This is one of the better roll-and-write games. Compared to other games, there does seem to be more choice. Some similar games force you in a certain direction, and that doesn't happen with Harvest Dice until the later stages of the game unless you're really bad at initial vegetable placement, or you're extremely unlucky.

Components: good quality, the dice are the good ones
Complex: easy to learn and teach
Weight: family
Players: 2 to 4, best 4
Length: 30 mins aprox
Mechanics: pick dice, pattern building
Decisions: good ones (which dice to pick up, where to place it...)
Opinion: you have a farm and have to harvest 3 different vegetables (won't say the name, each game will have a different one, but they are orange, green and red). To do so several dice are rolled and you have to pick up one in your turn, the die taken must be placed on your farm according to one simply rule... the same vegetable must be adjacent, and you must place a vegetable if you can do so, because, in case you couldn't you can feed the pig.
With such simply rules you have a really nice family game, you can teach it in 5 mins and start playing. Then you have to decide which die to pick up and where to place it, then watch if you can spoil your opponents, and then you can go for the pig.
The way the scoring happens is nice, you will score your vegetable groups according to the price they have, and this is determined depending on the die not taken (always one left), then you can score for completing your farm, for feeding the pig (oh, and the pig gives you several powers depending on how much it has eaten).
This is a great family game in a small box

Good dice drafting roll and write game that is easy to teach and has interesting decisions. Reminds me a lot of Rolling Japan/America in the way the vegetables grow but the crates mechanism that defines the value of the vegetables is a very clever layer on top.

"Overall, Harvest Dice is super! It's, like I said, a cute roll-and-write with great art and a super-slick drawing mechanic that I like a lot, but it's also got some nice drafting mechanics that are pretty cool. I'm a particularly big fan of the market mechanics and how not paying attention to what gets left behind can leave you with a very worthless board, if you're not careful. It means that you need to watch what other players are rolling and taking and keep active attention even when it's not your turn, which is something I've always liked about Qwinto, as well. If you're looking for another solid roll-and-write and you're not afraid to draw some really ugly veggies, then you should definitely check out Harvest Dice!"

Quite harmless dice game. There are plenty of same kind published and even in Spiel'17 I played couple of better ones (Cafe Fatal, Dice Age). In a bigger picture these all aren't the best in their genre, so this why such a low rating.

A fun, relaxing roll and write dice drafting game that works really well with kids. You get to draw carrots, lettuce, and tomatoes on your score sheet. We always have some coloured markers to colour our pictures while we wait for other players to decide which dice they want.

I'm not sure I liked this one. It felt like I really didn't have a whole lot of decisions to make. It mostly is a dice drafting game. I'd pick No Siesta over it every time - though this one is more simple and my daughter could play.

Auction game which was actually pretty interesting. Really like the artwork in this one and the bidding mechanic. You are trying to buy cards for their powers and try to collect tiles to place on your home board. I actually liked this, but it ran long so it gets looked over.

I'm a big fan of roll-and-writes and this one is not bad, so I gotta give this at least a 6, but it has several features I don't like in roll-and-writes.  1) It's turn-based dice drafting rather than simultaneous turns. 2) Because it's drafting, good play demands you stare closely at other players' sheets to block them. 3) Pig spaces make higher dice always better, at least by mid-game when players start being unable to draw in any veggie number. 4) You can always use any die - you're just choosing which is the best for you, screws opponents, increases the chance of adding to the market color you want at the end of the round - there's never those great moments of "I just need me or you to roll exactly X" so common in roll-and-writes. 5) Related to the last point, with pig powers (and you can use multiple ones on single die if necessary), there are usually several dice that you could change into what you really need for veggie planting so you don't care all that much what was rolled.  

I most enjoy the tactics/player interaction of focusing on 1-2 veggies and trying to orchestrate that the right color die is the left over one for the market while the opponents try to prevent that, but it's not enough to overcome the negatives I listed above to let it beat out several other roll-and-writes I prefer like Extra!/Noch mal/Qwixx/Qwinto.  Oh, as I'm a pretty good drawer, getting to spend time perfecting my veggie pics while I wait for my turn is a big plus - I'd like to see that aspect in more roll-and-writes.

[Grey Fox Games 17 Edition] {Farm; dice, set-collection; optimal 4p} Harvest is a nice filler, with meaning choices and user interaction.  Players need to collect as many vegetables or feed the pig the most.  It's easy to set up, easy to teach, and children friendly.  However, it's not outstanding, compared to other dice rolling games.

The game includes too many basic scoresheet. It'd better if that's 50 basic and 150 advanced score sheet.   And, I generally don't like games include pencils.

And I would have purchased this game if they include better dice - dice with graphics rather than pips on each colour dice.  It would be much better.

Got to play several times during its development and it is a really fun roll & write. It scales well for all players and has multiple strategies for such a small, tight game, thanks to the "feed the pig" and "affect the market value" aspects, in addition to the primary fun puzzle of trying to optimally plant your veggies.

RATING: 6.5
tl;dr: nothing new to see here, move along, unless you want more of the same

Roll some dice, choose where to fill in the result on a score sheet and try to do better then the other players. We've had these kinds of games coming and going for a while now, but we're still getting new ones all the time. Most of them are quite fun and very forgettable. Some, like [thing=195528][/thing], do a bit more with the concept and stand out, most don't. This one doesn't. But that doesn't take away from the fact that it's quite fun and a good filler to close out an evening or get warmed up.

Not bad, the advanced scoring is the way to go with experienced gamers. If I have one complaint it's that filling up your garden is the main way you're going to get points in this game. Feeding your pig is a release valve mechanism for crap rolls and nothing more, which made me sad.

RATING: N/A
Family filler, roll-and-write dice drafting to plant carrots, lettuce, and tomatoes onto adjacent squares of personal gardens.  Feed the pig your unusable vege-dice for points and to gain dice manipulating powers.  The signature of this simple game is the undrafted die changes the vege prices in the market and planning crops accordingly.

This is my most-played PnP by far! The version I printed is likely out-of-date by now but it was very enjoyable: It was great at 2 players and at 4. Drawing your own vegetables added a cute twist to the puzzle of optimizing your score. Theme is just as adorable as the doodling it requires.

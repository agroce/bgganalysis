Reflections from my first 4 solo plays, (edit: all using the 1st edition):

The Good: Great artwork, interesting ideas in terms of narrative game play. The Bad: convoluted rulebook (more so than most SMG titles IMHO), on account of the abundance of defined terms and haphazard glossary contents. The game weight is a 4.5 in terms of rules, yet game play is maybe a 1.5/2 with advanced strategy and interaction regarding parasites and other players. The decision space is woefully small and the game functions more as a simulation or starting point for Megafauna 2e.

In general, the game exists in roughly two major arcs IMHO (maybe 3 in the advanced game); getting off the ground and getting your first micro organism started and then keeping it alive. In the early stages, a lot of stuff goes wrong, and you end up (in SMG fashion) doing things not because those things are efficient, but because it gets things moving. Generating currency in terms of catalysts by failing at rolls is required and sometimes you have to decide when to cut your losses, take the doubles roll, and generate life to hope for the best (esp once you understand how the clock is ticking)... Once you can get an organism up and running, then you're onto the second focus of keeping it alive as getting new cubes only comes in the form of new mutations which require currency to purchase. Each time you upgrade, there is that initial surge regarding parasites and danger that you need to prepare for. It's once you get that first critter up and running and can dedicate the rest of your bionts to refugia in order to either generate catalysts or more creatures that you start to see the decision space come into play (prior to that, it's limited...). The other reason I say there are two (maybe three) arcs is that in the beginning, you're dumping lots of refugia into play, then you have a midpoint where you're getting off the ground, and then in the third and final era, you start to watch all of the non-utilized refugia wither away due to spite events (in some ways, as a timer that the game is going to end) and you fight to keep your stuff alive to score.

Specifically about the solo games I've played so far. In terms of imagining how the world got started, it's a super neat story, and the cards are really clean and attractive which is an upgrade from many SMG titles (although, to be fair, as of late they have been a step up anyway). Fundamentally I'm sort of meh on it, and I can see where a game might only take 90min *once you can internalize the rules* (that last part being the most critical). The actual flow of the game isn't hard, it's just buried in a lame rulebook with an overabundance of thematic terminology. This is not a heavy decision game compared to something like Indonesia (or even Pax Pamir), and I dare sale For Sale has a more interesting decision space for the time involved. To get to that space though, you have to wade through getting life started and moving which is tough the first few plays. A large chunk of it is a rather heavy dose of risk assessment/management and knowing when to take those risks and when to be careful. That's where the small decision space is most interesting to me (especially in the context of evolution and how things played out). I can see where the game would be much better as a "game" as most understand the term if you played w/ 3 or 4 people. Parasitic attacks and all that come into their own there much more so than you'll see with the solo game, so my rating is part realistic and part aspiration. 

I figure by game 6 I'll have the rules down enough that I can comfortably start reading the over abundance of flavor text...

RATING: 7
An interesting experience, dripping with theme, though I wonder whether Phil has gone too far in blurring the line between simulation and function. In other words, whether the game is actually enjoyable enough to sustain multiple plays. I'm not sure if there is much depth of strategy and it's immediately apparent that huge score swings based on evolutionary flukes are a thing. Also, it's a bear to learn & teach. Still, I'm keen to try it again.

It's ... interesting. You definitely need read the (living) rules and rules summary completely and thoroughly, watch a few games and play through a few example games (not the solo game with the parasite AIs).

It's actually a simple game at its core. The game consists of a number of rounds as dictated by the event deck. First, draw an event. This will sometime pull refugia out of the landform decks and place unorganized manna on them, and also typical do terrible things to the player's organisms. Then player can assign their 'bionts' (player pieces, basically) to refugia to try and generate lifeforms, parasites to screw with more successful player's bacteria and (if they have HGT) to any bacteria as well. There are two dice rolls - first refugia will do autocatalytic roll, with low rolls organizing manna and high rolls disorganizing it and producing catalysts. Doubles can give the rolling player and bacteria. Micro-organisms make Darwin Rolls, in which you hope to roll 1's and triples to generate catalysts and avoid 5's and 6's avoid error catastrophe that removes cubes. Finally, player can purchase and upgrade mutations cards with catalysts. If they have enough cubes, they can produce a marine macroorganism, which if they place enough organs.

A couple of things intrigues and worries me about this game: first, I was expecting there to be more unique cards, like say Race for the Galaxy or Terraforming Mars. Pax Porfiriana, from the same company, has 210 cards in its deck. This game has 16 placards as refugia/bacteria, 20 microorganism mutation cards and a bunch of events. I was expecting more, but that I could just be my expectations. I thought I was getting a card game, but I got a dice game instead.

The second concern is how much choices and control the players have. Autocatalytic Rolls can be mitigated by adding catalysts and by having the progenate (i.e. the rolling player) be the same colour as the placard, which allow one (and only one) re-roll. That's not a lot of choice! The Darwin rolls are more interesting, with yellow cubes allow selective, one-time re-rolls, blue cubes blocking a high rolls. That can be more interesting, but will it be enough in the long term?

Let me end of a hopeful note: an intriguing possibility within the rules is how the competitive game, is the need for a careful balancing of co-operation and competition. Opponent bionts on refugia allows for more dice = increasing chances of organizing manna and creating life, but all catalysts go to that player, for example.

EDIT: Tried first game introductory game. I'm still undecided on it. I'll chalk up it my obvious inexperience in explaining the game, but I feel that without the parasite my second problem, of too much randomness and not enough player control, may be realized. May take some more plays.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Sure, there's a hump to get over before the game starts playing smoothly, but once that's done there so many interesting little systems to play with.  The talk about the rulebook is silly, just set up the game and slowly walk through a game or two. 

At first, you are just a biont trying to establish a stable microorganism. In that stage, nature--as primarily expressed via the event deck and dice--is brutal and life doesn't stand a chance. Then life finds a way: you mutate just right and nature's withering glare gets a bit less intense. You are now a stable microorganism that can increase its defenses and mutate in ways that are more beneficial to your evolution. With continued progress, you can evolve into a macro-organism and, finally, make landfall. There are a ton of satisfying moments as you journey through this game's arc. That arc, though, is greatly affected if other players (and/or NPCs) inject themselves into the evolution of your organism, and the effects can be beneficial or destructive. 

There's quite a bit to say about the subtleties of the game play, and much of it won't be apparent until you've played a few times. There is some familiarity in the mechanisms if you look. Much of the game is built on an economy system that is primarily influenced by tableau building, asset sharing/investing, resource generation, and dice mitigation. That those mechanisms come together to tell the story of Bios: Genesis is pretty wild.

Like most Phil Eklund games, the rulebook is dense and it can be challenging to really wrap your head around the flow of the game, but once you do it's very enjoyable. You don't HAVE TO learn anything, but that's still part of the fun for me.

I LOVE THIS GAME! I am a field epidemiologist as well as a biology prof. I really appreciate what Phil is trying to do with this game. However, this game is not for everyone. The rule book could be put together in a more logical fashion. The theory and thought put into this game is great. However, I have only played it solo because I can't get anyone interested enough to play it with me.


SO COOL! I love it Phil!

Update: I played it several times, but almost always lsot. I really like the biological correctness, but the rules are super hard written and not very understandable. I made some short rules to be able to explain it to friends and we played in a group of four as well as only two, but its really hard work to play.

If you like Phil Eklund games, this follows in his tradition.  If you don't like Phil Eklund games, steer clear.  

However, I strongly suggest folks download the living rules.  They make things quite a bit easier to understand.  That said, that's a pretty regular feature of Phil Eklund games, too.

Very cool science sim.  Super rich theme.  But it makes the game tricky to learn from the rule book because things have different names in different situations and it's very willing to sacrifice simplicity for theme.  I think that maybe a video or player aid could improve it quite a bit since a bit of a time commitment to figure out.  Pretty cool if a bit random and punishing.  Great art.

RATING: 10
This is the first of Phil's games to easily cruise to 10 plays; pretty impressive for a game of this complexity. While I actually don't think it's that complicated on the order of these things - it does help if you are at least passingly familiar with some of the science - it does have a lot of different, interlocking game systems that you need to understand. The physical design of the game does help a lot, but not as much as it could, and not as much as a typical euro. There is a bunch of stuff you just need to remember.

But if you get past that, wow, there is a ton to like here. The game gives you real tactical and strategic choices in addition to the science, setting, and narrative - a combination very infrequently achieved. The mechanism for parasites are not only interesting thematically, they also provide utility in terms of a backstop so players always have stuff to do even when they choke the autocatalytic and Darwin rolls (a problem with Bios: Megafauna; as much as I liked that game, the randomness could sometimes wipe you out in ways that weren't particularly fun. Now you just turn into a parasite). The game isn't that long, and moves at a pretty brisk pace.

I like this for 2 and 3 players. I'd still play with 4 but it gets a little bit tight and I'd want all or most of the players to be experienced; I'd recommend sticking with the slightly lower counts until you have a feel for the game.

For me personally, I still think Neanderthal is the best of this line of "survival" games, I think just because I like games ahout humans and I find the science more fascinating for that one. But all three of these games (Greenland, Neanderthal, Bios: Genesis) are totally awesome games that I rate a 10 and that you should play if you have either an interest in the topic or an interest in seeeing what can be accomplished by the boardgaming form.
---
I'm on the record as a huge fan of Neanderthal and Greenland, but those games were so good that I wasn't convinced Bios could keep the trend going. But, I'm three plays in now, and wow, this game is good. It may be in fact the best of the three in terms of "gamerlyness", in that it gives you a lot of interesting choices and dynamics over and above being a great gaming take on recent science.

If Bios Genesis has a flaw, it's that it can be a touch overlong, at least at the higher player counts. While it works fine with 4 players, I get the feeling that the sweet spot is probably 3.

The rulebook is without a doubt one of SMG's more daunting ones. But the game plays pretty cleanly, maybe even more so than Neanderthal. My top tip is to sit down and solitaire this sucker at least once, very methodically, before you spring it on anyone. It's not hard per se, but it's some work to grok. Once you get it, you can shepherd others through it without too much trouble. It's really worth the effort to do it right, to put in the time to master the rules. Like most SMG games it's not bad once you get it, but you do need to get to that point.

Yet another science trip from Phil Eklund. Besides the vast interest that this has as a scientific theory of how life emerged, which every geek can subscribe to, this is a wonderful, tense, brutal and deep game. As always with Phil's games, the dice can make or break you, staying true to the theme, so keep it in mind. And as nearly always with Phil's games, there's exception upon exception (thematically justified of course, but still), and then again, there's the usual SMG rulebook, that is a tough nut to crack. If you care about the subject and want to find a wide decision space, at least form the mid-game onwards, do yourself a favor and grab a copy as fast as you can find it. The game is superb!

+ Fantastic theme and treatment, this is an educational feat bar none
+ Wide decision space, full of nuances, yet the structure of the game is very simple
+ Tense and tough
+ Quick to play, and with minimal downtime 
+ Great graphical design and component quality 
+ Small box footprint

= Full of screwage, no multiplayer solitaire here
= There's the luck of the dice, you learn to love it or hate it
= The theme is not for everyone

- The rulebook is really opaque and the rules are full of special cases
- There's 2 misprinted cards (but that's no big deal, really)

It's interesting. The game is a good simulation of the origins of life on earth, the components are good and the colors are vibrant. The rule book is awful. It's not that the rules are mechanisms are difficult but covering it in the theme of organic chemistry just made it more difficult for me to grok. After a number of learning plays, watching videos and a successful playthrough, I couldn't get past the theme and just felt like the game was on a rail taking me through a story.

Based on one play. 

A difficult journey through forming life on Earth full of dice chucking and upgrading your microorganism. Take lots of risks and will them to work.

Looking forward to trying the solo game.

Update: In a way the Solo game is better. Most of my games are solo at this point, and I don't see that changing. The rules are very simple yet also convoluted at the same time, and I'm still not sure if I'm getting them 100% correct...which is a staple of Mr. Eklunds gams as I understand.

Recently my kick has been more euro, which this game is not, so I haven't had the urge to play it.

In the BGG database since the start of 2012 and the game has finally had a release date attached to it, October 2016. Phil Eklund did well with Pax Pamir we'll see if this is any good.

The theme has me extremely intrigued - I just hope it's a good game!!

Play as an organic compound shortlyer after Earth's formation. Amino Acids command Metabolism, the lipids create cells, the pigments control energy absorption and storage, and the nucleic acids control templated replication. Their goal is a double origin of life: first as Autocatalytic Life (a metabolic cycle reproducing, yet not replicating, its own constituents), and the second as Darwinian Life (an Organism using a template to replicate in an RNA world). Players can play cooperative, competitive, or solitaire.

A real mind-burner. Bios: Genesis holds no punches back, both in gameplay and in the densely scientific rulebook lingo.

The idea of simulating the first four billion years of life is fascinating, and I am attracted to games that try to put hard science in games. However, the game is very hard to learn from the manual because there are many steps involved and the manual is very comprehensive but in a small font and very dense. Further, there is a lot of randomness in the game, which makes sense thematically but isn't very satisfying to play.

Tough dice chucking random mess with an almost endless possibility of expansions (new organisms, events, etc.). I understand the randomness of the creation of life, but this is a game and your choices have little impact since the dice and cards just makes your turn obsolete as if you had never played. Removing some of the randomness and managing it further would result in a much better modern game. Modern games never have your actions become useless (unless you are given a compensation).

To me, the idea is great, the info in the game is great, but the mechanics are primitive and should not be such a random mess. Sure, there should be some luck factor, but not have the entire game based on luck. What's the point of playing if my only action in the turn gets undone by some randomness? No fun in that.

Educational.

Decent enough to buy I think, for the price and amount of stuff in the box. Especially if you like luck games. But form me, who plays modern games where your choices matters, I will only buy this on sale if ever.

mechanically brilliant and rich integration of the theme and diverse theories. Really love how the game captures the harsh struggle to create life. Only played solo a couple of times and found it very interesting experience that has led to more detailed reading about the subject. However more a novel intellectual exercise than actual fun. other Sierra madre titles I've played are more enjoyable. Maybe it will get better if I try playing this multiplayer.

Oh boy, where to start? This game is a highly thematic rollercoaster from start to finish. Very heavy in the luck department due to all the dice rolling, but there are also a myriad of ways to mitigate luck of the dice. 

The only downside is the rulebook: absolutely dreadful. I get why the rulebook was written like that, but it took me several solo playthroughs (simulating a 2-player game) to have the game emerge from behind the rules, and I still fear I'm playing rules wrong.

The biology of micro/macroscopic chance vs. the chaos of terrestrial climate formation. (Those molecules haven't got a chance...)

Bios: Genesis is, as promised, a small box game which models the big box real world global formation and base evolution of the first life forms.

Potentially critical dice rolls occur often, and frequently the results are brutal- but this was most likely what life was for the first forms, short and difficult.

Players attempt to start little pockets of life, to protect them with scant resources from the high level of global chaos, and hope that life happens (and that it happens with enough genetic stuff to build upon when the dice do fall true).

This is an experience in statistics and science at the same time as it is a game- it's another work of genius and labor of love from Sierra Madre, and I'm very glad to have a copy.

Update: I have now played this once solo, and once with other players.  Each occasion clocked up a good few hours, so I'm a long way to having the playtime down to the promised hour or two.  However, it is great fun, with many stories emerging over the course of the game.  In general I dislike the randomness of dice games, but the theme is so strong with this one the it is a pleasure to play through.

The highlight of my first Essen in 2016 was 45 minutes of hands-on rules explanation, in a group, of BIOS: Genesis with Phil Eklund himself.  What a pleasure!  Now I need to complete my reading of the rules and strike while the iron is hot to actually figure out this miniature monster dice game!

RATING: 9
It is a very difficult topic that is covered by this game. That coverage is an absolute masterpiece. The game is fine. It will be linked to the other Bios series. Best played with 4 players and the Marco variant.
The rating has changed over time from 8 to 9. Why? I appreciated the sense of an accomplishment when developing an organism through 4 stages (location, microorganism, maritime macro, terrestrial macro). This staged development is somewhat lacking in the successor Bios: Megafauna, which is more a multiplayer contest. In Megafauna you acquire new mutations for the sake of terrestrial domination. In Genesis you acquire new mutations/organs for the sake of creating an advanced organism.
The 1 player potential of Genesis is superior, especially if you employ the Chimera variant (which did not make in on time for publication). This is indeed a very good solitaire game, originally made for multiplayer. (Here comes a comparison to Leaving Earth which was conceived as multiplayer but is used as a very good solitaire).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played Solo game only so far, which sadly is very random. Roll, hope to live, roll, hope to survive darwin stage. Buy mutation, mutation gets stolen. Roll for catalysts, roll to hope and survive. You are attacked on 3 fronts by the randomness (heat / oxygen / Error rolls), and it is very rare to be able to protect yourself on all 3 fronts. 
Probably more fun with more players, will funcion well as a coop because of the brutal nature of the game killing off player organisms --> Try to survive together.

A simulation of the start of life on Earth.  I have only played this solo.  You start with a refugium, that you try to convert to a microorganism and then you add mutations to create macro-organisms.  The game is very dice oriented but various mutations can help.  Also, you can attach parasites to organisms with mutations.  

The rules are long and Phil uses proper scientific terms for gameplay.  This can make the accessibly and learning curve steep.  But at its heart, the game is pretty easy to play once you have this down.  

I enjoy the game but it does seem that like many of his games that utilize dice, luck could hand someone the game.  You have to be OK with the concept of dice and luck factoring into the outcome.  But this is a brilliant simulation and I found it pretty fun.

As with all Phil Eklund games, will take a few plays before I figure out the game behind the mechanics. A preliminary 7 because I want to continue.

update: I've played it a few more times now solo and I'm not sure how much I want to continue anymore.  The game is really opaque.  A great experience when things go right but not one I'd just pull out and play in the same way that I would with Bios: Megafauna.  When things go wrong it is hard to pinpoint exactly where.  

I think the map events in B:M are critical to its appeal; even as your guys are stuck behind some ocean or impassable terrain thanks to the climate you can still watch the world change and reflect on how you got yourself in this position.  The vantage point in B:G is so far-out though that rows activating and deactivating doesn't inspire the same sense of wonder and overall progression, especially when coupled with the fact that a few bad decisions early on might have your bionts stuck behind a gate that never opens again, leaving you to just draw cards and flip activations until the game is over.

I missed out on the playtesting of this one.  The game certainly looks ambitious!  Glad to see Phil finally getting recognition after so many years of obscurity.

First effort: wow, the only way to learn is to play.  Did a four player game, semi-competitive solo, and for about a bit over half a game.  Lots of struggling but I think I have it, minus the trophics and parasites.  Wow, the game seems to actually work!  I am very excited by this one, and want to spring it on the group.

[ImageID=2982868micro][/floatleft][b]BIOS: Genesis[/b] designed by [person=174][/person] (High Frontier, Pax Porfiriana)

One to four players start as organic building blocks in the primordial soup, specialized in one of four pre-biotic functions: cellular, metabolism, reproduction, or energy management. These correspond to fats, proteins, sugars, and pigment respectively.

Bios: Genesis, a prequel to Eklund's Bios: Megafauna, can be played in a cooperative "Gaian" or competitive "Medean" mode. Players can swap genes, or become internal parasites or symbionts.

Solitaire, competitive, and cooperative play options.

Product delivers starting Oct 21 2016.

Perfectly captures it's theme that life is hard by letting you spend turns building your lifeform to the edge of life and then just destroying you with a bad roll of the dice.

While I have yet to play this one and I know the designer is constantly tweaking and updating and making new editions of his games, I'm a little saddened to see this is already in its second edition. The game has only been out ~6 months. I'm fine with buying a second or even third edition a few years down the road, but this one seems far too recent to warrant a full new purchase. 

I will be ordering the update kit at least and hopefully that brings it very closely in line with the new edition, but I am a little disappointed with how fast of a turn around this new edition is.

Not bad. I have only played along with a friend who's studied the rules and watched a few videos, so I'm learning by asking questions of him as we move along trying to build up to victory in noncompetitive fashion. 

The game is compact, components decent (including Spree candy pieces), but it is hard to know what's going on, though, for someone uninitiated. Cool names for the events, but I doubt this will ever be my cup of tea. Still waiting for the home run Eklund game I've been dreaming of, whatever it may be.

Bios: Genesis's fascinating and well-researched theme makes it unique and an outstanding addition to the board game hobby. Players who are not interested in biochemistry and who are unwilling to pay close attention to the detailed thematic information that comes with the game, should probably stay away. On the other hand, if the origin of life interests you this game is a treat.

AKA Let There Be Life: The Dice Game. ;) I don't have the knowledge of biology to judge its scientific accuracy, but Bios: Genesis sure does tell a fantastic story. Over turns of 200 million years each, depending on which cosmic conditions are at play, bacteria form, and then, if you're lucky, macroörganisms. (The story pauses here, to be continued in Bios: Megafauna...)

What little I know of the subject is that the conditions required to sustain life are rare, and that certainly comes through: you've got to roll well to become a bacterium in the first place, you've got to roll well to not die, and you've got to avoid drawing any of the events which can kill you, which is most of them. You've got to hope you avoid either of the possible armageddon scenarios, like the frozen Snowball Earth.

As a game, and not a biology lesson, I am far less convinced. It's not that there is no strategy: there are interesting choices to be made around biont placement, around parasitism, around timing, around mutations to purchase etc. But they are dominated and frustrated by the random elements. Parasite rules appear to exist chiefly so that players who can't get bacteria have something to do.

All this is exacerbated by the complexity of the rules, with so many interrelated subsystems adding thematic flavour. The use of scientific terminology may make things easier on players with the right background, but to a layperson it just means that components are re-used with different names and different rules in different contexts, making learning significantly harder. Insofar as it's a simulation experience, rather than a game, it's probably worth it. But you have to know what you're getting into.

I strongly suspect that it works better in co-op mode (and best, due to the overwhelming rules complexity, as a solitaire game) where those random disasters are the enemy and, as in real life, no-one is going to win by owning the least-worst organism when the world ends early and dies in fire.

Eklund at the apex of design geekdom (the rules and definitions are mind-numbingly complex, plus the micro font is rather annoying), but it is also equally fascinating - consider this game to be a mini-monster.

As strange as it seems, you won't be able to learn the game from the rulebook but instead just setup and struggle through play (things will slowly develop and then come together with multiple epiphanies).

The extended example-of-play is welcome, but it has too many errors and too many skips (these things really need to be triple-checked).

High Frontier level of confusion even after multiple plays. The more I play, the more I understand (but I'm *still* at a loss in several areas) - very thematic, fun, creative game, and a drop dead brilliant design!

Small box, big game. Beautiful production too.

Suffers a bit under the weight of its vocabulary, and it's the sort of game you must see in action to understand, but Bios: Genesis is a worthy addition to the survival series of Eklund games, ranking alongside Greenland and Neanderthal. I personally relate better to the historical settings of those other two, but this is a fascinating and dynamic game all the same.

Rating is based on a playthrough of the basic game (no macro organisms).  Hate to rate this so low, and perhaps I am letting my own expectations get the best of me but, man, this was rough.  Despite a plethora of rules and procedures for every event in this game, I was shocked at how much I felt like the game was stringing me along, leaving me helpless to react to the dice rolls, card draws, or other player actions.  Hoping that the advanced game brings some more meaningful decision-making into the mix, but I need to take a break from this game for a while.

NOTE: This rating does not really reflect my desire to play again.  In fact I am more motivated now to play the full "advanced" game to prove myself and my experience wrong.  Phil deserves a different kind of kudos for inspiring that sort of determination in this boardgamer :)

Another top notch simulation from Phil Eklund. Science galore about the spark of life (or how tough it is for life to thrive). As a game, it is actually not bad. I wish the iconography was more evocative of the game effects (as it is now, you need to refer to the rulebook or multiple aids to figure it out). For the heavy science inclined gamers!

After a couple plays:

This game didn't disappoint. It captures the theme perfectly. It's got a lot of randomness, as should any game trying to simulate evolution. It's simpler than High Frontier from both a rule and gameplay perspective, which is both good and bad. For bio geeks this game is great. If you're thinking you might like it watch the Gray Board Gamer's youtube videos, which give a great walkthrough of the game.

Prior to release:

I heard about Phil's game High Frontier last year when the Kickstarter campaign was released. Before committing to buying the new version I lucked out and landed a copy of the original in a local math trade. The rulebook is daunting, but for a space geek the game became an instant hit for me. Thankfully I have a group of friends that are into space as well and look forward to deep strategy games, so getting it to the table took no convincing.

If Bios can even partly replicate High Frontier's depth, it stands to be a fantastic game. The big draw for me as well with Bios, is how much Phil's games can teach you about something. The rulebooks are technical but they're also filled with so much sciency-goodness that you walk away with a deeper understanding of the world, and that's a pretty cool side benefit for a game.

This is another of Phil Eklund's wonderful biology experiment games. It focuses on theories of how life crawled out of the primordial ooze, comet dust, volcano vent, or whatever other natural chemical lab you can name. The game is a lot of fun, but I gamble that a whole lot of people will be put off by the randomness inherent in Phil's simulation.

Most of this takes place in the early game. Later, once your little protocells get a foothold, there are a lot more ways to steer your organisms toward survival. At this point the harsh environment of early Earth will continue to assault your creations, but barring any particularly brutal runs of bad die rolls, it's not too difficult to transition to the end game, where your single cell creations level-up into full-fledged complex organisms.

As far as I am concerned, the early stages where you have almost no control are no reason to hate the game. Phil's games are meant to teach as well as entertain, and all that early game fickleness is meant to teach you something. When it goes bad, just laugh it off, enjoy the narrative and play again...Because the good news is that it only takes an hour or so to play.

First: the theme is fantastic, interesting, deep, complex and personally it was the main attraction for playing this title.
Unfortunately the game experience was a complete let down. Complicated, convoluted, long, random, frustrating to the nth-power and, most of all, devoided of any fun.
What a pity.

Love the theme and portability, but there is far too much dice rolling for my taste. Also, it is very easy for the tiny components to get lost.

Phil's designs intrigue me immensely. They teach you about their topics in such a wonderful way. They are true auto-buys for me at this time, and this game did not disappoint! I love it. It is teaching me things I never knew about before, and in such a fun, and interactive manner. Kudos Phil!

[b]This is kind of a median rating[/b], because I still don't know how I feel about this game, although I remain fascinated and determine to understand it and play it correctly. My ultimate rating will likely be somewhere in the [b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4 [/bgcolor][/b] to [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] range. On the high end of that range, I keep itching to play it, to understand it, to conquer what seem like dense, nearly incomprehensible rules to a perhaps not terribly difficult game. On the low end, there may be little player control, maybe the game is supposed to be long, the rulebook is really a reference book and does an abysmal — I mean really, really terrible — job of teaching you how to play the game, and the ratio of rules and exceptions to choices and fun may be very high. …but I really still don't know at this stage.

I finally decided to allow myself to try Bios: Megafauna before mastering comprehension of this, and [partially due to my experience grinding this game's rulebook], and it is incredibly more understandable. I'm not sure how much of that is Genesis' molecular-level biochemical thematic vernacular and concepts, how much of it is Megafauna (2e) having two co-designers, one of which I already know to be able to keep rules and rulebooks sane and manageable, and how much of might be Genesis being that much worse of a game than Megafauna.

Still, I persevere… for now….

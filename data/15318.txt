Auctioning, set collection, tile-laying game.

This is a medium-light filler game that is VERY similar to Alhambra.  On your turn you can: a)take money (and you want the same currency colour), b)auction or buy a tile(s), c)reconstruct your palazzo for a small cost.  The main difference between Palazzo and Alhambra is that you can work on several different palazzo's, and there is an auctioning option.

Scoring consists of having large palazzos with lots of windows and ideally the same colour.  There are penalties for having small palazzos which will generally happen if you try to make too many of them.  The duration of the game is relatively short, and somewhat unknown due to the game-ending condition- when a picture is generated through the placement of 5 tiles randomly placed in the third and final stack of tiles.

Overall, a decent lightweight game with soem strategy that scales well from 2-4.  If you like these types of games (like Alhambra) you'll like this one, but don't expect anything innovative or exciting.

A fun and fast game. This game does for me what I hoped Clocktowers would. I appreciate it for it's quick game length and tight decisions... you can't take your time with this one and expect everything to work out. I like balancing the tower building options, and figuring out how much to spend on the auctions. I like Capitol much more than this, but will play Palazzo again. I'm curious to know how it will stand up to repeat playings. UPDATE: The more games I learn, the less desire I have to play this game again. Bummer. UPDATE: traded for Money!

Comparing this too much to Alhambra is a wild exaggeration, though there are a couple of mechanics there in common with it - that's all.  The general play of the game is more a sort of bidding and buying game mixed with Campanile-style tower building.  It's not really a bidding game as such, because bidding is only a part of the game - maybe 20% of it.

Anyway, the long and the short of it is that this game is pretty good.  It's not as elegant as some Knizia's like Medici, but there is a lot to think about and it rolls 
around to a conclusion pretty quickly.

Played a demo game of this and I enjoyed it very much.  The strategies here are similar to Alhambra in that you should be aware of the types of buildings your opponents are collecting and what the next valuable blocks are that they will need.  If at all possible you should try to deny your opponents what they need while you collect your needed blocks.  A nice game and I though highly enough of it to purchase it for myself.

{1 play, 3 players} I'd probablly rate this lower if it weren't Knizia, because it all worked... but there was nothing really special here.  And then, just as it was maybe starting to get interesting, it ended.  However, I've had this initial feeling about Knizia games before, only to really "see" the game later, after more plays.  So, as I said, I'm giving Reiner the benefit of the doubt here... but I suspect my rating could just as easily drop, especially after a four-player game in which you have even fewer chances to build.

alhambra elements are definitely there.  i've heard clocktowers is signifigantly present, etc.  i don't particularly care about that sort of thing as long as there isn't so much overlap or lack of fusion that it isn't worth owning alongside its influences.  fairly simple rules although somewhat tough to explain, and surprisingly quick-playing.  i'm more reminded of the puerto rico newbie kingmaking type thing with this game than i am with puerto rico itself.  despite its flaws, i suspect that alhamba might be more fun though.  weird.

Played 3 times...lowering from 6 to a 5. In all my games, Palazzo seemed too short to exert enough control on your building scores and as a result, I'd say luck tends to mostly determine the result. Theme is a bit weak - placing building floors between other building floors seems a bit ridiculous to me but then again I don't have problems with the palace shuffle in Alhambra. Nothing really new - not a stellar Knizia in my mind. Quintessential average (5).

A few playings in and I enjoy the game.  A bit like Alhambra, but I prefer Alhambra at this stage.

End of game scoring is interesting and requires you to pay attention throughout the game and not make mistakes in buying, during auctions or building.  If you do, your score will be affected in a negative manner, plus you'll need to spend turns fixing mistakes rather than moving forward.

Alea Medium-Box #2

[i]Posted: 2/24/08, Rated: 6[/i]

[i]Palazzo[/i] is the second title in the [family=59]Alea Medium Box series[/family].  The first game, [i][thing=13642]Louis XIV[/thing][/i] is a surprisingly meaty entry from [person=381]Rüdiger Dorn[/person] which offers a very robust experience for such demure packaging.  The series is off to a very good start when the second entry has been designed by the [person=2]Good Doctor[/person] himself.  Thus, I had high expectations for [i]Palazzo[/i].

What did I find?  Let's see here...players are builders and master architects in the city of Florence, in the 15th century.  Wow, that's new and interesting.  I'm glad for this period of time, simply because we would be missing out on so many games without it.  This overused theme no longer inbues me with excitement and anticipation, and I have to say it prevented this game from making it to the table for a while.

Unsurprisingly, [i]Palazzo[/i] turns out to be a well-constructed game.  The stutter-step nature of placing tiles in the quarries based on the location of the "Master Architect" piece was interesting.  Controlling when and how many pieces are auctioned is an important consideration.  Earlier in the game you can risk carrying an extra piece in your inventory because you should be able to choose the "reconstruction" option before the game ends.  Later in the game, you'll want to play more conservatively so you don't get caught with a single-story building, which incurs a penalty.  Hand management plays a part as well, as you look for sets of cards for a bonus, or else several cards of a particular "currency" (suit) in order to be successful in the auctions.

These tactical considerations are enjoyable, but they aren't as important as getting lucky with good options in the material supply.  Being able to purchase a tile you need, when you need it, without competition turns out to be a huge advantage.  The staged tiles lend structure to the game, so that you're usually bidding on top-tiered tiles (the "level 5's") at the end of the game.  Also, the game's end is triggered randomly, so you can't be assured of having enough time to reduce your exposure to penalties.  I enjoyed this added tension.

[i]Palazzo[/i] is a good game, if not a particularly memorable one.  It doesn't surprise with depth like [i][gameid=13642][/i].  If I wasn't collecting Alea games, then I would probably have passed on this one.

The first few plays of this game were fantastic.  Many people compare it to Alhambra in that it has multiple currencies and buying tiles.  True, but I like this game better.  The tile acquisition mechanics are better and more interesting.  Though, I do like the tile-laying mechanic of Alhambra better.  I'm astonished that this game doesn't have a higher rating here on BGG, especially because of how good it is as a two player game.  I will admit that it is a game that feels like it has too many rules and that hurts it, but if you can handle them it's worth it.

Another very good Knizia middleweight.  The trend in gaming seems to be toward more complexity or games that kind of play themselves.

Maybe I just need to play more.  ** UPDATE 2009: played again after wanting to play for a while... and I enjoyed it more, maybe because it was a 3p game. **

En cada turno puedees conseguir dinero, construir (comprando directamente o a través de subasta) o reconstuir lo ya construido. 

Al final se puntúa según el tipo de palacio. Se puede puntuar negativo ,por un palacio de una planta. Cuantas más plantas y más ventanas mejor. Si además, no has mezclado materiales (hay tres posibles), mejor aún.

Muy entretenido y sencillo de jugar. La copia que jugué es de Javi y me da una pena enorme tener que devolverselo, porque creo que es unjuego que puede ver mesa con cierta facilidad. Muy al estilo Knizia.

The scoring for this game is simpler than other Knizia games. The acquisition of money, one of the turn action options, becomes popular, but should not be relied upon as a winning tactic. Opportunities will be missed to buy or even bid on palace tiles, which are given out when they reach four per quarry. This becomes an excellent balancing mechanic to hoarding cash. A challenge in deciding how to collect money sets, whether to buy or bid, and how much to commit to bidding. Should get more plays due to its simpler gameplay and length.

What a delightful discovery.  Picked this up in an auction for cheap to combine shipping.  My wife and I have been pleasantly surprised playing this.  The auction mechanism works really well for 2-players.

One thing that always impresses me about Knizia's games is his ability to find the "sweet spot" when trading off between control, randomness, complexity, and game length, something that eludes most desingers. Palazzo is once again in this spot: a pretty simple game that plays quickly, has a chunk of randomness (which means it can be played more "for fun"), but gives the players enough options and control to be satisfying. Not going to provide the long-term challenge of a Taj Mahal or Amun-Re, but for what it is, excellent. Better than Louis XIV, I think, and more obviously replayable.

How many auction games can play 2?

Played with nongamers and was a hit! UPDATE:  Played again with another nongamer and went smooth.  Excellent intro auction game.

Played it three more times--I love it.  It's highly scalable, great with 2, 3, or 4 players.  Because there only a handful of 2 player auction game (other great one being Medici vs. Stozzi) that actually works, Palazzo is a must in every collection.

Very interesting game.  Fiddly scoring, but hey, what did you expect.  If you're part of the Cult of Knizia, just get it, you'll like it.  If you're not, the strategy level is deeper than his lightest stuff, lighter than T&E, and holy smokes is it nice to have a bidding game for two players....might rise with more plays.

I liked the bidding/purchasing mechanic in this game:  one can either buy one or two building floors at a price inversely proportional to the number of pieces in the center, or auction the "next" set of pieces in one of the side areas.

Slightly disappointed after a couple of 2-player games, but of course my expectations were high, Palazzo being an Alea and Knizia game. Enjoyed it much more as a 3-player game, so I'd say it's an ok game with 3, but with 2 or 4 players at the table, I'd rather select a better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
After one play. Rating could go up with more plays.

Many similarities to Clocktowers, but with more interesting decisions and more options. I think the "Alea" name may have raised expectations too high (plus the "Knizia" name, of course). This is a solid, but not spectacular, game. 

I like the choices of actions on a turn. I like the way the money works, very reminiscent of Taj Mahal. There is a memory element, where you really OUGHT to know what your opponents have, but I'm never able to keep track that closely. There is a variable game end, which is very Kniziesque, but unlike many of his other games.....here it is random. I think the games where players can influence or trigger the game end are maybe a bit less chaotic than this one. Here it works like High Society, where the 5th card of a certain type instantly ends the game. I suppose since you can intentionally choose an action where you draw buildings or not, you can deliberately hasten the game end to SOME degree, but it still feels more on the chaotic side.

All that said, I enjoyed the game. It plays pretty quickly. The decisions are satisfying. I'd be up for playing any time, but I doubt I'll go out of my way to acquire this one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Palazzo really doesn't do anything new, but it still manages to be a decent, fast playing auction game with features from both Taj Mahal (the card system) and Alhambra (the building aspect). 

There are obviously some significant random elements involved in the game (i.e.: turning up a nice tile into the warehouse can be a huge thing) but I don't think anymoreso than Ra, a game I would compare this one to in terms of overall complexity and heaviness.

A decent alea release, but one that won't make my collection. While it is serviceable in its niche, it also simply doesn't do enough new things to earn a spot on my shelf. 

It's also worth noting that this game faded [b]very[/b] quickly for me. I wanted to get back to it after the first few plays but now it's down to a 6 for me...the game system does seem to work well, but it just isn't doing anything particularly new. This is a game that I think gains measurably from having a group that can just sit down and hammer it out though...if this is played quickly it is around 30 minutes and I have no problem with it...if it is played with min/maxers, newbies, or under otherwise slow circumstances it is completely intolerable to me though.

This is a very nice game which works well with 3 or 4 players. On paper it should be similar to Alhambra, but it isn't. The game has a totally different feel despite the similarities.

You don't have time to do things exactly how you want. There is fierce competition for the resources.

Players have options regarding victory - do you go for a fast game where you build more, low-quality Palazzos or do you go for fewer buildings but of better quality.

Production: Sturdy components; nice cards; interesting detail on building tiles, though the numbers of windows can often be difficult to count.  Play: Interesting decisions at every turn.  Money, or flip?  If money, which cards?  If flipping a tile, auction or buy?  I like all my choices, and I like that I can earn money or win auctions on my opponent's turn.  At first the different building tiles seem of equal worth, but they begin to quickly differentiate themselves. (2+2+3) (2 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Played once. The rules are more difficult than they should be. There are four main mechanics in the game. Pick up cards, buy a tile, auction a tile or de/re-construct. Once you figure out the mechanics, it is a pretty neat game. You're building buildings and the taller they are with as many windows as possible the better. But how the currency works is a little odd (unless you've lived in an area that accepts many types of currencies I suppose) and the auction part is touch to learn. Take your time. It is worth it I'd say.

A mix of known mechanics coming from Clocktowers and Alhambra, with a pasted-on theme and a luck-factor that is too big in my opinion.

Fair bidding and building game.
It is made up of well-known, tested mechanics, but everything is working together beautifully.
It is definetely less random than Alhambra (which resembles to, due to the money drafting, buying or reshaping choices and to the different color currencies).
Good as a 3 or 4 players game.

Players construct buildings, up to five stories high, out of tiles.  Options on your turn are take money, buy a tiles from the warehouse, auction tiles in the quarries, or remodel your existing buildings.  Points are paid out based on height of buildings, numbers of windows in the buildings, as well as building material consistency.  One of the Knizia 45 minute "medium" games he does so well.  Fans of Alhambra will probably like this one.  I like the decisions involved in managing your hand of money cards.

I'm late to the party on this game, but I found the combination of familiar mechanisms to be approachable and competitive, so I enjoyed it.    There is absolutely nothing new here.   It combines things you've seen in older and newer games like High Society, Lost Cities, Asara, Firenze, and others into a workable mix.   Component quality is a bit lacking, and typical of other Alea games.

Quirky rules, but quick and fun. I like to think of this as a "fun" version of Lost cities with auctioning and less math. The variable ending is nice, and could easily be omitted if it rubs one the wrong way. I've played this with 5 players and it seemed to work out well.

Palazzo is a relatively rare game which seems to get overlooked these days in favor of its admittedly superior Knizia-designed predecessors (Ra, Modern Art and Medici in particular). You are building towers from tower pieces and these pieces sit in 5 piles. You have the choice of either auctioning a pile out buying from one of the piles. There are some neat mechanisms in the game and it flows well. And it plays in 45 minutes or so.

Palazzo is a great discovery, a lost classic from the impressive Knizia range of auction games, and one I hope to play again. I ordered up a copy immediately after playing. Whilst not quite in the league of Ra and Medici, it is very different from those and therefore a welcome change.

There's a lot to think about in this little game. Multiple options with limited  actions and resources %u2014 typical Knizia. Also lots of variable scoring at the end %u2014 again, typical Knizia. Although I'm not a great fan of auction type games, this one works well, once everyone understands the money (which can be a bit confusing).

OK game - a bit random/luck based at times as success depends on whether you turn over useful tiles to buy or not, but you can do something to mitigate this.

It does have some interesting ideas, but doesn't quite click.

Right now it fits snugly in that pocket of light, short games that I can't ever love because they're light and they're short.  But it seems pretty tight, and delivers some tough choices.  I'm not sure how many plays I could see wringing out of it before the mechanics became a bit rote, but it does the job of brainy filler pretty well.

Normally, I think theme complaints are for those born without imaginations, but I do have to say that counting windows didn't cause my heart to explode with excitement.

[b]Rating based on - 3 plays, 2 player[/b]
A Reiner Knizia auction game where you are competing to build the best palace and must compete for the best building pieces to do so. Neither of us particularly like auction games, but I decided to experiment with a couple to widen our horizons a bit and this one didn't look too bad. We actually had a good time with it on our first play. My gaming partner described it as "a cross between Alhambra (but in a fun way) and Firenze". I do like Alhambra's tiles much better though – they are sturdy and the art is lovely. These are quite plain and it's very difficult to imagine the Palace Inspector being impressed either. The box is appropriately sized which I always appreciate, the rulebook was thorough and well laid out, game flows smoothly and plays quickly especially with 2, auction is quick and painless and there is a nice bit of end game tension when the rider tiles start coming out. You're pushing your luck a little bit and deciding if you want (or have the time) to buy another tile and do a palace reconstruction before the herald is upon you. 

The problem with this game is that it's just...bland. I was afraid it would be forgettable and it was, because on [i]every[/i] subsequent play my gaming partner had already forgotten we'd played it! I don't really see it getting a look in if it's on the shelf next to games we consider really amazing. We both continually improved on our scores from the first game but neither of us particularly cared...(bad sign!) and we haven't played since. Quite well regarded by a few people though.

Decent effort from Knizia.  Builders construct towers that score based on windows, floors, and building material.  A set collecting game with a strange money system.

This is a very well rounded and complete game to me.  Even though it plays very quickly it always seems like a lot went on in the game.  I like auction games and Palazzo gives me the feeling that the playing tiles are limited and time is short- thus setting up some great bidding!  I also like the option of buying instead of auctioning on my turn and I love how when a player chooses to draw money the other players get some too.  Like all auction games the difficulty scales depending on the makeup of your gaming group.  Relaxed or tense, Palazzo can be as tough as your group makes it.  The artwork is very nice and gives the game a classic feel.  I only wish it had full sized playing cards.

Palazzo uses several mechanics that can be found in other games. There's really nothing new or innovative in the design. That may sound like a bad thing, but it's really not. Knizia takes those aspects from other games and mixes them together and perfectly balances them to give us a great new game. It plays quickly, scales well from 2-4 players, has interaction between players, and gives you plenty of interesting choices to make on your turn. It's rare that a game with auctions would work for a 2 player game, but Palazzo works surprisingly well. 
If you want to show someone what the German game explosion* is all about, Palazzo would be a great game to get them started on.

**** Back on the wishlist due to Mr. Gola: http://boredgamegeeks.blogspot.com/2005/11/view-from-fifth-floor.html - Thanks Joe. **** March 2005. Knizia + alea normally an automatic buy, but the distressingly low complexity factor makes this a look-before-you-leap situation. We need more 7s and 8s than 3s and 4s from alea. However, the temptation to start a mid-sized alea box game collection might be too strong - hey, first two games are from Dorn and Knizia. Now that's a good start to any game line!

RATING: 7.5
2-player rating. Goodness, this was a surprise. Expected just another Knizia auction game, but Palazzo turned out to be special indeed. Strong hints of Alhambra and the old 3M favorite Venture, and yet it still manages to feel unique. A very subtle game of valuation, hand management, and timing. That it works exceedingly well with two players only heightens the appeal.

For some reason people love to compare this to Alhambra.  Some even go as far as to see this as an improved version of Alhambra.  Why?  I don't know.  There are a couple similarities, like spending one type of currency for building, and you are trying to build stuff.  That's really about it.  The two games play differently and have a different feel to them.  Anyway, Palazzo is a good game, I enjoy it.  It won't be replacing Alhambra in my collection, though.

Palazzo is an accessible and agreeable game that I would usually be willing to play.  But since it doesn't really do anything new, and since I can list at least 35 Knizia games that I think are better (I just went down my list), Palazzo probably won't make it into my collection.  Combine Alhambra and Clocktowers, fold in the bidding/card system from Fifth Avenue, and you've pretty much just designed Palazzo.  The game has gone over well in our group, but I foresee the enthusiasm tailing off after a few more plays.

Parting shot: the game's graphics and components are horrible!  Gracious riposte to parting shot: amazing that Knizia has designed 35 distinct games that I prefer to the solid-but-bland Palazzo!

RATING: 7.5
Seven games, thrice with two, twice with three, and twice with four. Best with three or two — four is okay but I would probably suggest something else with that number. 

The game is a lot more tense than I thought it would be from just reading the rules. Essentially it's a set collection game with an interesting currency system, and the individual items must be collected in a certain order. You can add an item to a set out of order, but you have to waste a turn to do so. 

The down side is that it is easily the most convoluted and rules-heavy Knizia middleweight to date — the Stefan Brück influence, no doubt — and you really need to get all those little rules right in order for everything to work properly. 

One other thing that's important to note is that while there isn't a lot of money pressure, there is definitely time pressure; there are only so many tiles to go around, and because of the distribution you can't necessarily make up for buying nothing in the early game by buying a lot in the late game. Unfortunately, if everyone does nothing but stockpile cash the game will stall; you need at least one player who will put pressure on the table by auctioning or buying.

I like this game, but I don't love it. Unlike many of Knizia's designs, it doesn't seem as fluid and elegant. It makes sense once you get it, but at the onset it seems forced. It's not a must have, because many of the mechanics seem recycled from other games.

Although not nearly as good as his other offerings that year--namely, Beowulf and Tower of Babel--Herr Doktor's version of Alhambra is much better than the latter. It's a game of auctions and tempo, knowing when to draw cash and when to spend it just as much as how to spend it. Very simple, very quick, and very good.

I rate this lower than Alhambra because it just isn't as fun to play.  I think the mechanics are arbitrarily complex for what should be a light game.
***Updated 12/3/05 from 6 to 7.  I think this game benefits from a quick setup time and pretty quick game play.   You could knock out a game in 30 minutes, which helps the rating in my book.  Still seems a bit arbitrary.
***Updated 1/9/06 from 7 to 6.  The only thing saving this game from a 5 or lower is how quickly it plays.  This really feels like a game that plays you: it very often seems that you don't have a decent choice of actions.

Auctions often don't work with two. Who other than Reiner Knizia could pull this off! (note: he's not the only one who's pulled it off, but he's the first one you should have expected to have pulled it off! See Dorn's Goa). Not terribly deep, but certainly enjoyable for its weight and length.

While not in the same level of complexity as the 'Heavy' Knizias, This game is significantly better than its two biggest influences, Clocktowers and Alhambra.

While the game has a pretty high luck element, it's much more controlled than in Clocktowers, Alhambra or Beowulf. Details like the 3 points for the free bid, slow development of 4 and 5th floor tiles, and the quirky VP structure show a level of care that few designers care about. The fact that the game plays in 30 minutes is an added bonus: It's a good game to play at lunch.

My biggest gripe is that Knizia did not select a more interesting theme. I'd have gone for something that involved building an army of flying monkeys to attack the poor sob riding the horse.

First played August 4th, 2010. This game has a lot of luck to it. There is some strategy however. There are five markets which hold tiles. The center one is your private market (cost is 10-# of tiles in it; you can buy a max of 2 tiles here at the same cost for each). Each player starts out with 4 random money cards. On each players' turn, you can sell at the market, take money (draw 4 money cards, take your choice of two and pass to the right for each player to take one), or re-arrange your tiles (can take one from a building and place it by itself, place a single tile into a building, or discard a tile from the game). When you go to market, first you take two tiles from the draw stack (in three phases; 3rd has 5 game end tiles). The first one goes into the private market and the 2nd one goes into the market x amount of spaces clockwise from the market figure. (i.e. 4 is place in the same square as the figure).  You may buy from either market, however the public market available is where the figure is located. If no tiles are at his location, he moves clockwise until he reaches a location with tiles present. If you choose the public market, then you start the bidding with $3 which you get free in the deal. Bidding goes around with the player to the left needing to outbid the previous or pass. To pay for either market, you must have the amount or more. Cards range from 3-7 in three suits along with wild cards (match any suit) with a value of 2. Also three different color cards of the same # count as $15 (i.e. three 3's of different colors). When someone takes the market action and the 5th ending tile is drawn the game ends immediately.

Still playing this a lot after a year of ownership. Currency restrictions are from High Society. Scoring mechanism with -5 for starting a new building is from Lost Cities, as is the mild rummy mechanic in how you pay with currency sets. Auctioning batch lots is different from Ra because of the window ordering: The best scoring tiles are always 3 auction quarrys away! I like the changing auction mechanism where if 4  tiles build up on one quarry then it's just a first pick once around the table --which also has the effect that if a juicy 1-2-3 combo builds up too long, the entire set is split. Excellent Alea artwork and components elevate this family level complexity game. Fast setup, good filler game. Really like as 2 player, 4 player is a bit sparse with only 2 buildings each. May buy second copy to double building tiles for 4 player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.6
It involves bidding on and placing tiles to form structures.  How can I go wrong?

After playing it, I have to say it's a pleasant blending of those mechanics.  I like the auctions, and my wife likes the building.  It goes well with O Zoo le Mio or even Vegas Showdown to an extent.  It's much lighter than either of those though.

The only downside I see to it is the rather dry theme.  I mean, I just sure didn't feel like I was building a tower.  Whoopty-doo.  But still, I think I'll pick it up and get it played.

It was also very quick, but featured some reasonably important decisions.  I also liked the random game end of course.

Palazzo is yet another well-crafted Knizia design. The beauty of the game is in the fine-tuned combination of different mechanics (it is far from being just an auction game) that create a satisfying and, at times, tense gaming experience. The only slight flaw is that occasionally the luck of the tile draw can have too significant an impact.

The masses are right on this one, nothing new but nothing wrong either and it is similiar to Alhambra. This doesn't seem as dry for some reason so I like this more. Everything works well together and the auctions help keep it interesting.

My first play of this game was with two players. It was too easy. After that, I played a few four-player games and it was much more interesting. There was a lot more going on with the auctions with more players (obviously) and it was much more challenging to create multiple palaces made up of all the same material since the tiles were being distributed among twice as many players. It's hard not to compare this game to Alhambra which I like with two and three, but not with more. Palazzo doesn't seem so good with two but I do like it with four.

I like this one a little bit better than Alhambra.  There's more thought involved as play unfolds, and I gravitate towards auction games anyways.  But the missus hates this game (not only is she firmly anti-auction, but she hates doing all the requisite math that takes place after any Knizia game), and she LOVES Alhambra, so this will never hit the table unless I'm at a game group.

Light'ish Knizia game where players (in the role of aristocrats in rennaissance Italy - yawn!) bid for palace facades and try to build the nicest and most point-worthy palaces.

Despite having a nice blend of randomness and strategy, and despite being a Knizia game with auctions (for me, an unbeatable combination!) I haven't really warmed to Palazzo. Sure, it's got strategy and the design is rather elegant but to me it *does* feel like one of the more boring new entries in the long list of light'ish bid-and-build games. The auctions don't really feel exciting, and the palaces you build don't really look snazzy (so no visceral pleasure in building them).

Furthermore, I can't really recommend the game for two players, since the auctions now become even more boring than with more players.

In conclusion, not a bad or broken game by a long shot but still one of my least favorite Knizia games.

[1 playing] Palazzo basically works as a game, but it lacks any special mechanism or agonizing decisions, and so it comes off as an also ran.  It seems more like the release of a minor designer than of Reiner Knizia.

Two mechanisms drive the game.  One is the way in which building tiles enter the marketplace and get bought or bid on.  The other is the way the tiles accumulate into buildings and score.  Neither have that special Knizia spark.

The game is eminently playable and I'll be happy to see it hit the table again.    But it lacks the sort of character that have made early elegant Knizia designs like Modern Art or its distant cousin Lost Cities catch fire.

The game plays quickly and your options are simple once you get into it. For a Knizia the scoring mechanism is rather bland.

An auction game at its core, but with some interesting choices along the way. Each turn you can collect money, or buy from a common supply, or invoke an auction from a side supply. balancing these opportunities is what makes the game interesting.

The game is pretty easy and has a lot in common with Alhambra: players take money, buy building tiles, build buildings, can later sacrifice some turns to redesign their buildings. But in this game you build multistory buildings and have to build each from in increasing order and preferably from the same material. It is important not to sacrifice too much for building a perfect building. Yes, it is worth the most points, however it is very difficult to build it. The game weight is improved by scoring rules: most points come from windows on the build tiles and too small buildings do not score at all or even scores negatively.

Žaidimas gana paprastas ir turi nemažai bendro su Alhambra: renki pinigus, perki pastato detales, statai pastatą, gali vėliau paaukoti kažkiek ėjimų ir jį perstatyti. Tik šiame žaidime statomas daugiaaukštis ir reikia statyti aukštus didėjančia tvarka ir, geriausia, iš tos pačios rūšies kortelių. Svarbiausia neužsiciklinti ant tobulo pastato pastatymo. Taip jis duoda daugiausiai taškų, bet jį ir pastatyti sunkiausia. Žaidimą paįvairina tai, kad pagrindiniai taškai ateina iš langų skaičiaus pastatytose kortelėse ir tai, kad per maži pastatai taškų neduoda, arba dar ir juos atima.

Very overproduced, could have been done as a 110 card deck card game. But that doesn't really matter. This is another proof of RK's skills at creating games around auctioning. This even works well with two, but overall the auctions could be a bit tighter.

I like it, although not as much as other Knizia's.  I had incredible hopes, which may detract from it a bit...
Still, I think it is a worthy game in most collections and it sort of tweaks what Alhambra wants to do.  Makes it quicker, more direct.  Alhambra is deeper, imho.
(I don't own the expansions) as I have recently gotten bored after many, MANY plays of Henn's game.  Palazzo is similar enough, yet still different, and so the debate will go on...

2017-06-12 - 6 - It's okay auction game with quite interesting curency auction mechanism. It's also unfortunately a little ugly and utterly ridiculous regarding the theme. I also wonder if I ever want to play it if I have the awesome Ra, but if you ask me, I could play this one too.

RATING: 7
Decent and fast-moving auction game, although the theme is a bit thin and design a bit weak (the jokers would make more sense labelled as "+2"). Works okay with two players, with the auctions boiling down to a lot of cut-throat "I am going to force you to pay at least X for this thing I don't want, and hope you don't pass and make me buy it", although a bad run of tiles can make for a boring stretch of game.

Best word to describe this game is elegant.  From the money system to the auctions to the game end mechanic, just lovely.  Good auction game for 2 players which makes it great for couples.  I am quick to put it on the table and reluctant to take it off.

Light, quick and simple auction game without any new or innovative concepts. Nevertheless it is an excellent game and fun to play. Nice balance between randomness/luck and tactical/strategic choices. Aim for high palazzi with lots of windows and avoid single floor palazzi at all cost! By the way, the link with the theme is not that poor as some claim. Around 1500 in my hometown Bruges, the wealth of a citizen was determined by the height of his house (the top floors were often only a single wall without real living space) and the existence of a window tax indicates that having lots of windows was costly.

Think Alhambra but involving bidding for the tiles in the process as a possible action.  Fine game, but its not spectacular.  As a two person game, I found it really lacking competitiveness as we pretty much were able to build what we needed/wanted.  Four person game proved to be more competitive with auctions and building but still proved to be fairly tame overall.

RATING: 8
Interesting, quick-playing game in which players must build palaces.  The quest to construct in sequential levels for maximum efficiency reminds me of Lost Cities while the auctions remind me of several of the designer's other games.  Despite some people's legitimate complaints about originality, I found the game light, quick, tense and, most importantly, fun.

Tight and quick - just what I like in my Eurogames! That said, points have been deducted for the bizarre syntax in the English rulebook; it took far too long to figure out what needed to be done!

Also, we houseruled it so it doesn't matter what currency you used, and it made the game very enjoyable.

Update: I'm sorry, but now I've got Alhambra, there's only room for one of these games in my heart...

This is a simple auction game that works well with my 7 and 9-year old daughters (and still challenges the adults).  It is simple to teach and play, moves quickly, is great with as few as 2 players and has a (surprise) ending that can really make final plays tense.  I didn't like this game at first but have grown to enjoy it much more than many auction games.  I wish the game had more colors... sometimes the (bland) building tiles seem to blend in with the (bland) quarry and material supply mats, making the items difficult to see.  Otherwise this is a very good family game!

Well - I can't say that I am very impressed by the game. It's probably better than Alhambra, but there are better Knizia games that use very, very similar mechanics.

Rating started out at 6, as I felt it a bit simple and mediocre, repeating many familiar mechanics. But the more I played it, the more I realized just how wonderfully tuned and blanaced the game was, and just how many tough decisions there are to make. Every play makes this one better, and while it may not be a 10, or even a 9, it is solid an 8 as any other game as I have rated an 8; perhaps even closer to 9 (but I don't do fractional ratings). Good production values and a lower price point make Alhambra's long lost sibling a winner in my book.

A quiet little game; not as engaging as Alhambra but more interesting than the very dull Clocktowers.  Plays quickly and pleasantly with two, but one doesn't get the feeling in the auctions that there is very much at stake; if you don't win this tile, well, you can take the next one.  Run out of money?  well, take some more.  Maybe it's just the way we play it but there is a distinct feel of lack of urgency about everything which is unusual for a Knizia game.

Underrated Knizia auction game that is often compared to Alhambra by some.

Apparently, plays very well with 2 (despite being having an auction mechanic). Worth getting for this reason alone.

Good review: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/527437/how-does-this-compare-to-alhambra

Downside: Shanon Appelcline was not impressed.

Bottom Line review isn't a fan: The Bottom Line
Palazzo is an auction and drafting game that is suitable as a medium weight game for gamers, but, because of some fiddleyness and poor theme to mechanics integration, is not the best choice for non-gamers or as a gateway game. I recommend it only if you have gamers to play with, and need to add variety in the middle weight, forty-five minute niche.

Some, on the other hand, like it a lot.

RATING: 7.8
I find it thematic enough, but I like abstracts. Reading the rules it seems slightly complicated, but it is in fact very simple. In this aspect it reminds me of Power Grid.
There are some interesting mechanics in play:
- Hand management
It is important to make the money "work" for you.
- Bidding 
Often the bidding sequence is as much important as the maximum bidding.
- Action Point
Too many things to do in too little time. Moving a tile to another palace for example takes forever (2 turns).
- Variable finish condition
As in Saint Petersburg, some times you have to try accelerating the end, sometime you want to delay it.
 
All in all a good game, altough it felt much lighter than the other two games of the series that I played (Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence). 

In two people it plays very fast, and is ampong my favourite 2 player non-perfect information games (with Saint Petersburg and Clans).

I usually love auction games, but I really thought this was a bit thin and boring. Bid on different levels for your building, the levels are worth more if the bricks match and have lots of windows... Ehh, windowed walls just didn't get the buyer in me all hot and bothered - YAWN. While the game is not shameful, it's just not that entertaining or fun. The choices are a bit obvious and it just never builds the tension that is so important in an auction game. As a short filler, it's acceptable.

I agree with all my fellow geek buddies that Palazzo has similar mechanics to Alhambra & Clocktowers.  In fact, each mechanic is extremely uninspiring although put together they make for a workable pretty well-balanced game.

It may have been something wrong with my strategy or an unusual occurrence, but I got stuck early in the game with not much worth bidding on.

In “Palazzo,” players play builders trying to score points by building the tallest palazzos with the most windows. There’s an interesting auction/buy mechanic that is good, solid and simple.

Wanted to like this better.  2 main problems for me:  (1) game feels the same at beginning, middle, & end.  There's no drama to the game.  If you can afford a floor tile in one location, or outbid for a building tile in the other, you do, if you can't, you don't.  (2) Who's winning?  If a couple people have several multi-floor palaces, it is not easy to tell who is in the lead.  If that is the case, and the game comes to an end, then we all do our calculations, and someone has more points than someone else.  Not exciting.

Now compare this scoring to Knizia's great card game Battle Line where you don't do an algebraic equation to figure out who won.  There you need a majority of flags or three in a row.  How exciting to prevent an opponent from getting that 3rd flag in a row, and win by majority.  Why doesn't Knizia do more games with non-victory point conditions?

This is a rather mathy euro from Knizia with the theme being one of building apartment buildings in the renaissance age.

Players are attempting to construct five level buildings from different materials and each level has different numbers of windows. On their turn, a player may get more money to use for bidding,  flip up some building levels to either buy or auction off, or rearrange existing building levels. Points are awarded for higher level buildings, made of one material and more windows. (Points are lost if you only have one level). A light Knizia game, there isn't a lot of control over the buildings you flip up on your turn. It's okay, and plays quickly.

Not a favorite Knizia game of mine, but a tight design that I admire all the same. Superficially, it seems very similar to Alhambra, but it offers harder decisions and entirely different forms of player interaction. The game is a little bit dry, even for my Eurocentric tastes, but it's undeniably a solidly conceived package.

RATING: 6
A fair amount going on here.  There's a touch of Lost Cities in the game as you need to decide rather early how many palaces you're going to commit yourself to building.  Rating is after one play and I expect it will go up.  It's difficult to get a firm handle on what good play consists of during the first game and the system and scoring are just barely unintuitive enough to be distracting.

RATING: 4
Can I just say:  "Ugh..."  Too few choices, dry and pretty uninspired.  Definitely not an Alea game I will be adding to my collection.  Sorry Reiner.

RATING: 6.5
Good old Knizia game. I liked the auctioning and building selection process, often makes sense to "steal" someone else's auction rather than start your own.

Difficult to play if you like conformity though, as you just don't want to build a marble floor on top of a brick one! lol
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Plays like a mixture of Lucca Citta and and Knizia's Money -- it has the former's scoring goals (tall buildings made of a single material with lots of windows) and the latter's unusual money valuation system (not to mention that it's also an auction game like Money). Each player can only do one of four actions, a mix that feels about right and moves the game along snappily. There's a great deal of probability-based luck in the game, such that the best player should exhibit an edge over the course of 10-20 games. Talk about fast though; two co-workers and I successfully completed a first play that started 22 minutes into lunch hour, and that included instructions (none of us had played it before, but I had read the rulebook)

RATING: 7
You either auction/buy level for towers, or take money. That's the decision you make on your turn. But this decision is sometimes tough. Do you try and take an auction with only one or two floors, or do you take money and try to strengthen your bidding power? I like it.

RATING: 5
Palazzo quickly reached the end of a depressingly short life-span. The game mechanic never sat happily with the theme, and it was just not as fun as it should have been. Keeping track of other players' palaces was time-consuming and adding up the scores was arduous. More miss than hit from the Good Doctor this time.

Good little bidding game where you build palaces in fifteenth century Florence and score for each storey, windows and being constructed from the same type of stone. The storeys seem to come prefabricated from the quarry which is an odd thematic hiccup. The palaces look more like tenement blocks too.

RATING: 6
I was hoping this might be a new Ra type game I can play with 3 with the family. It plays fine, and has that same 'do I sacrifice / do I wait for better' decision making but it doesn't have the variety of tile that provides a lot of the appeal in Ra. It also seems awfully tempting to just keep taking money until the money runs out and then shoot-out, which seems a bit odd and non-satisfying.

Palazzo has an engaging and non-trivial auction mechanic, integrated with a well balanced card game.  How many original auctions can Knizia come up with?  As many as he has games, I guess.  And that is a lot.

Palazzo is not heavy.  I put it close to Tower of Babel (which came out the same year) in the Knizia ouvre.  I play this frequently with my girlfriend. It works well for two.  I would not say it all that deep, but it does reveal some subtlety of play after a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Palazzo is an auction-based tower-building game.  The main interplay is trying to get stuff for good value, while getting the tower pieces in the right order for your board, as it's difficult (but not impossible) to rearrange your tiles once you buy them.  Your towers must be built in numerical order, and out of the same materials, and the pieces can have extra features like windows that affect how they score.  Overall, this was a pretty good game, but it didn't really stand out.

What my wife and I play instead of Alhambra. It plays quickly, works great for 2, and has a theme we enjoy that doesn't seem entirely pasted on (but it is). Exists in the sweet spot between a mindless filler and a brain burner that plays in less than an hour. The kind of game we can play on a week night on occasion after the kids are in bed.

Decent filler, you are either picking up some cash or floors for your buildings, which end up as victory points. A little bit of strategy mixed with bidding made it interesting.

RATING: 5
A little dull and more frustrating than most Knizia games, in that the luck of the draw can really help others.  Also, kind of a dull blend of aspects from High Society and Alhambra.  I feel more in control in Alhambra and somewhat more manipulated in Palazzo.  In Alhambra, you get much more time to recuperate from a lucky draw, and though I haven't always won, I've always been competitive.  In Palazzo, the game is too short for a lucky draw to be balanced out.

Agonizing decisions every turn, simple to learn but appears to be quite deep, nothing really "new" with this game but all the mechanics flow well together and it feels very "fresh", could easily be played in 45 minutes, very balanced design, it uses some bidding but it's not really a bidding game, it a bit feels like solitaire but not really, very girlfriend-friendly, worked GREAT with 3 and I'm sure it would work well with 4 and even 2 (rare for a bidding game).  Highly recommended, this makes up for Knizia's flop "Tower of Babel" and Alea's flop "Fifth Avenue"

One reason why I'm always interested in Knizia designs is the surprising extra layer of consideration unearthed while playing his seemingly simple games. What he can do with a limited amount of components coupled with (often) simple rules is always a joy. I feel nothing illuminates this better than comparing Palazzo to Alhambra (though some may disagree with this comparison).

The overwhelming advantage Palazzo has over the SdJ winner is that the two random subsystems of drafting money and building blocks is managed better.

With the money, Knizia allows 3 of the same value in different colours equal 15 in bidding making even small denominations worthy and creates tension and angst in set collecting/splitting as well as watching if your opponent is set collecting.

The building blocks come out in 3 semi-scripted batches, knowing how the tower manifest plays out is one way of trying to make the auctions/purchases work in your favour. Do you push your luck to hopefully put 3 blocks up for auction or will a 1 door slab force a free handout? Will you get a desired level into the central market at a cheap price and no competition. But if you don't take from the market will you leave cheap slabs for your opponent?

More importantly the fairest part of the design is  that the wertung/scoring mechanic is not as uncertain, being only in the last batch and requiring 5 parts to trigger the summing up, giving you some breathing room to reconfigure your buildings or discard single slabs.

So mechanically Palazzo holds my interest more than the straight forward approach of Alhambra. Palazzo packs all this in a shorter playing time. 

The reason why Alhambra will see more tabletime is that it is more accessible (and has heightened uncertainty). Though Knizia's genius becomes apparent, so does his maths background. Sadly Palazzo labours under some fiddly rules, fractured (though not scattered) variable values and fixed bonuses for building "high and pure". These aspects have to be absorbed to make the right decisions.

I tried to remove this cloudiness by reducing the window/door counting and palace additions by using numbered chips. Though this help to give more clarity to make a more informed decision and add tension to the scoring mechanic, there was still a bit of mental work to do.

Even though Alhambra may have fixed values which are easier to handle as well as the easier comparison of majorities (though the sprawling walls bonus undermines this ease), neither design delivers the tension that the wertung mechanic promises. Only High Society comes close to fulfilling that promise.

Unfortunately I discovered on my second play that the wrong tiles had been included which meant the brick buildings I had started with were very difficult to complete!

As usual with Knizia, theme comes second. It's a game about buying either through a sale or through auctions. It reminded me slightly of Wettstreit der Baumeister, which has a similar 'theme' and play. Palazzo gives you a bit more options, though, as you can rearrange the buildings somewhat.

Recently revisited this game, and it really is a 'meh' game for me. It lacks much of the tension of Alhambra, and I may be one of the few people who would make a comment like that. Tis is really just a nice little Knizia filler that really does not live up to its alea parentage nor its Knizia heritage.

Grabbed me right from the start, but didn't quite hang on. One of the more simple Alea titles - there's not too much to think about.

Reminds me of Alhambra, with even more luck!

Palazzo doesn't doesn't do anything especially unique, but it takes a few familiar mechanics and creates an enjoyable experience. It actually reminds me of a more euro version of Asara. It's not quite a filler but it's light enough to be a family game. One complaint I have is that it's maybe a bit dry. Not Knizia's best by any means, but enjoyable enough to keep around.

Auctioning for tiles, which must then be built in increasing floors to construct palaces. Palaces with many windows, 3+ levels, and of a single material are worth the most points, others can earn negative points. Players can also purchase some tiles, as well as draw money, which is collected in sets (like the tiles) to maximize purchasing/bidding power. Alea medium box game family.

Jogo de Knizia, a meio caminho entre o processo de transição de "Lost Cities" para "Keltis", desta vez com uma abordagem económica que não se faz sentir por aí além, num jogo com base leilão, ainda que muito mais simples que o seu "Modern Art" e com fortes parecenças a "Medici". Componentes e arte fracotes não o favorecem...

Alhamb-Ra!! This game feels like Dr. Reiner Knizia's take on the 2003 [i]Spiel des Jahres[/i] winner.

[i]Palazzo[/i] seems like [i]Alhambra[/i] with auctions, which is good as they bring more interaction between players, and a different scoring system, as [i]Alhambra[/i] is a majorities game and [i]Palazzo[/i] has a unintuitive and mathy scoring mechanism, [i] à la[/i] Dr. Knizia.

After one play, I'm lukewarm at best about this one. Admittedly, this is at least partly due to the theme, which is one of the most boring I've run across. Building layers of a building, trying to score windows and doors? Snooze City. 
Update: Played again and liked it much better. I'm still not a fan of how someone can be completely helped by the fortuitous flip of a tile. I also really like the depth of game in such a short play time.

Palazzo is an interesting auction game where players compete to assemble the best/most palazzos by purchasing storeys of buildings (from 1st to 5th) of various materials (marble, brick, sandstone). There are bonuses for building taller building and for using only one material within each structure. Having more windows and doors also helps increase your score. You need your palazzo to be 3 storeys tall to score any points for it; if it's a single storey you lose 5 points. You auction and purchase the building storeys using only one of three denominations of currency (and/or certificates, which are wild), similar to Alhambra. You can also spend 3 cards of the same value, but different currencies, to get $15 (so, three 3's could be worth $15 instead of just $9).

Palazzo -- Played with three and four players.  This has often been compared with Alhambra. I find the two games markedly different from one another. While the two games share some elements which invite comparison, each game as a whole differs so much from the other that broad comparisons are simply inappropriate.  So (just to be inappropriate), I thought Alhambra was more difficult, in terms of both rules complexity and strategy. That difficulty makes good play commensurately more satisfying. Palazzo, on the other hand, is more approachable and faster.

RATING: 5
Whatever initial lustre I saw in Palazzo wore off quickly with subsequent plays. There may be a certain Knizian simplicity in how each turn comes down to either drafting money or drawing tiles, but the game built around that feels awkwardly stitched together. The main offender for me is the disruptive [thing=12][/thing]-inspired game ending condition, which often incentivises players to drag the game out by drafting money. 

As usual with most Alea medium box entries, Palazzo is saddled with several minor rules which are likely to be overlooked after an extended period of not playing the game. Also, surely the rule which allows the [i]removal of an entire floor from an existing building[/i] should have tipped the publisher off to search for a more coherent theme? It’s a rather muddled auction game at any rate.

RATING: 6
I like the set-collection, the selection of different actions you can take, and the tough choices that these encapsulate and which create tension. Folks who complained about it being too light were looking for something that the game never intended to be. However, I find it to have a lot of sameness to it, and the scoring is much too opaque.

Above average Kniza. It's a strange hybrid of Clocktowers (Building upwards) and Alhambra.

Initial thoughts

The Good: A great 2P auction game that works! Wifey likes and easily understood gameplay

The Bad: Not much of a theme. Don't like the game end mech where it's dependent on certain tiles being drawn in the last phase. Means a game can suddenly end before you want it to...

Chances of getting to table: Good
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very interesting choices, as per usual in Knizia, but (in the first game at least) the choices were so strange that at time I felt I was just winging it.  It was very difficult for me to determine how much the money is worth.  Anyway, I'd like to play it again to see if the strategy stabalizes a bit in my mind (if that makes any sense).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initial rating after one four player game. I'm kind of waffling on this one. Some things about it, I like: the choice of calling an auction for tiles versus just purchasing some outright from a central pool and the need to remain flexible while planning for different contingencies in your construction. But there are some big detractors for me. First of all, it seems as if there is only one good strategy for success, and that is to keep drawing money early in the game so that you can control most of the auctions by being able to outbid other players whenever you wish. This is my primary gripe, and if my initial judgment is correct then this rating will drop precipitously upon further plays. Second, I do not care for the art design. It isn't bad - I just don't like it. Third, the game is murder on the color-blind or impaired. There are three kinds of currency and for me to tell which was which, I had to examine the actual coins printed on the cards. This means that I could not tell what I had when fanning the cards traditionally, because the corners only sport little colored circles with numbers in them. Who chose these colors anyway? I can't distinguish them or even name them! If I could , they would get names like ennui, depression, and malaise. I can't tell those apart! There just one big mess of suffering to me.

RATING: 2
Am I wrong about this?  It seemed the best thing to do was to take money and win when other people bid.  This is the best way that you can control the currency, and therefore the best way to win other people's auctions.

What happens is that people keep taking money hoping that someone else will be a sucker to start other bids.

The game has an awful pasted on theme.  

We aborted the game halfway into it.  None of us were pleased.  

****THIS GAME GOT THE BONE*****

UPDATE: I'm a guy that will give games more than one chance.  Years later you may find that you are in a different mood, with different people, and suddenly you like a game you thought was crap before.  

Not here.

This game puts the zzzzzzzzz... in Palazzzzzzzo.

I was wrong in thinking the game was horribly unbalanced toward money. Still, once the cold war for cash starts (looking for those sets of threes), it takes a serious shift in group think to get people back to bidding on buildings again.  This drags down an already tedious and overly methodical, luck heavy, bidding game.  

This is a prime example of what a boring generic Euro design is like. 

In addition, the brilliant Andrea Myer once said to me, "All Euros have similar ingredients, it just depends on how much you stir it that determines if your game is original or not". I have a hard time believing that there was much stirring here.

This game almost got The Bone again, but I insisted on finishing it.  Silly me.

Palazzo is a pretty good light game.  I think it plays excellently with two or three, but loses a little something at four.  I like the multi-colored money that works in sets to make amounts more (usually) than their sums, and the auction element to get the tiles from a building site.  I also really enjoy the "portrait" that ends the game.

RATING: 7
When this was first released, many called it "Reiner Knizia's fix for Alhambra." Did Alhambra need fixing? Was this intentional, even though Herr Doktor claims never to play other designers' games?

Regardless, I think Palazzo = Alhambra + Clocktowers

From [gameid=6249]: (Alhambra)
- theme building a palace(s)
- on your turn, you can take money
- money comes in different colors
- you can buy and build palace pieces; purchases (by auction or outright purchase here) must be in currency of a single color

From [gameid=12538]: (Clocktowers)
- buildings (palaces) are built by floors
- floors have windows/doorways

I don't find Alhambra very engaging - decisions seem to be pretty straightforward, buying for exact change when possible, taking money otherwise (while keeping in mind that you should have a hand in various colors, and try to lengthen your wall). When you take money, generally take the higher values. (I don't know the distribution of colors/walls, so that information would probably be important). I didn't like Clocktowers much, either: just not very interesting, although I only played it once. But I can't help thinking about both these games when playing Palazzo, which I like much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun game with an interesting auction and monetary system that mixes in elements of Lost Cities.  The rules and scoring are a bit blurry compared to other Knizia gems.  On the other hand, we should play it more often, since it is still always a good time.

[Alea German 2005 edition] {Medieval building; auction, pattern-building; optimal 4p} A typical Knizia's Euro game: full of calculation and planning with dedicated scoring rules. Palazzo has some nice player interaction.  It may be boring in early game, where players just collect money cards first and few auctions are called. The game itself works - providing decisions and tense; however, it's not very fun for me.

Rules are not intuitive but they are not complicated either. It is quite thematic. The idea of rebuilding is weird, though. 

The bits are sturdy and the artwork is decent. 

Traded away in Nov 2007.

tl;dr: solid but very middle of the road

This game out at the tail end of Reiner doing games that are worth playing. There are a few notable exceptions, but for the most part the games he put out since 2005 have been very... skippable.
This game has pretty simple rules with only a few options, but they do create interesting choices. Do you buy a tile you need or do you add more to save money in a future round, running the risk someone else will grab it before you can? Do you auction off a set of tiles? Do you take more money? Pretty good options, with a scoring system that makes sense.
I quite enjoyed this. It's nothing new, but it's put together well, as you might expect from Reiner. But it's not developed so much that is has no soul left.

There is a lot of strategy in Palazzo, depending on which building materials you start building with.  Other players know what you want at any given time, so the competition for levels is pretty high.  I like the way the supply and demand works for the purchased tiles, and how the auctioned tiles continually change in quantity and quality.  The money is a bit weird at first, but once you figure out how you can pay for things, it's pretty clever as well.

I'm predisposed to like Knizia game designs and a big fan of auction games in general. Nevertheless, Palazzo fell flat for me. My greatest quibble with the game is that players have very little control over the timing of what gets auctioned, what they have in hand to bid with and what happens to be available for purchase. Much of what happens feels a bit random, and evokes that old complaint about a game playing you rather than the other way around. All in all, a disappointing addition to my favorite line of games (Alea) in my favorite genre of games (bidding/auction) by my favorite game author (Knizia). Jeez ... now I'm really depressed! Update: Tried this with two players, and found this better. Two players have far more control and more meaningful choices.  Game gets a thumbs down from me with four players and a thumbs up with two. Need to try this with three ...

Who will build the most magnificent palace? In the game of Palazzo, set in the age of the late renaissance, the players slip on the roles of wealthy landowners, who compete against each other to build the most valuable palaces. As their constructions grow, the players must choose from the available palace modules from the quarries, so they can add to their palaces. Of course, none of this building can be done without money, so sometimes players must take time out to earn some money so they can afford to continue their building projects.

An OK game, nothing to cry home about. Played with 2 players several times and at first blush, the auction seems to work well with two players. However, like many other auction games, more players are needed to make it solid. The theme is weak. Several rules seem pasted on and added to correct for flaws within the game. For instance, the no-auction rule once a quarry contains 4 tiles is rather lame and feels fiddly. As it stands, I will play this sporadically and only if someone asks for it. Doubtful if it will be played often.

This was a very nice game.  Comparisons to Alhambra seem unavoidable.  Mike Fitzgerald said that it is more like Clocktowers, but I haven't played that, so I like my comparison better.  Now that I've shamelessly name dropped, on to the point.

Instead of building from an overhead view, you build a tower from the side.  Instead of paying matching colors for building parts, you either buy parts in the center or bid on parts at the current location.  Either way you have to pay with matched sets of money, and like Alhambra, you don't get change.  This is a Knizia game, so instead of a victory track, you get to do some addition at the end of the game.

Knizia tried hard not to offend when he said that most other games aren't truly finished.  Did he just "finish" Alhambra?  That would be a bit rude, but I like it.

I learned this one first, but I now think of it as Alhambra junior.

Initially it felt too short - not by clock time but by total number of moves I'd get to execute. I barely started building and already we'd be on the III series tiles (and worried about the game-end markers).  I'm now more adjusted to the pace.

Just from reading the rules I found the procedure to be attractive. In practice it can be frustrating, though, that good conditions come up on someone else's turn and I'm left behind.  There is still luck of the draw but I'm learning more how to choose my floors.

Further plays leave me wondering what this adds to Reiner's oeuvre; there's not enough tension, the endgame can be screwy, and there can be a lot of windfall. But mostly it just feels cobbled together, not smooth and clean. Not bad, certainly, but that's a pretty low bar, esp. for Knizia.

A notch above the average for a Knizia game.  Interesting building mechanisms.

After 3 plays I still think this is probably one of the worst Knizias I've ever played!!

A fun, quick Knizia with the usual hand management, auctions, etc.  It's fun to build those palazzi.  Have played with 2 and 3-player games.

This is like ClockTowers - but has the missing elements to make the game work. A simple but effective game. Good for 2 players. Also good for non-gamers as well

Liked it better the second time around.  Pretty good for a light 30-45 minute filler.  Just don't expect more than it is.

Chris Farrell's comment on this game describe exactly what I think of this game. Maybe candidate for a 9, depending on whether it has the same replayability as San Juan. UPDATE: This has the replayability of San Juan for me. Up to a 9.

Fairly light and quick with some nice interaction and decisions each turn. 
'18/01/05: It doesn't seem all that memorable though, and I don't really want to return to it after playing it. I have decided that this kind of bidding is better done elsewhere (e.g. Fifth Avenue), so this is not a game to keep in my collection.

It's simple - I like this game - a lot.  It's my kind of game, and because we're family gamers it fits in nicely.  My son didn't want to play at first - didn't think it looked fun, but after our first game together he gives it his thumbs up.

I'm obsessed with wanting to make all of my buildings out of white marble.  I think this holds me back a bit. :)

this game even plays not bad with 2 (I've played the RA variant so many times with my daughter when no-one else is interested in playing), but I managed to even get the missus to give it a try. Final score was 52-56 to me, so was very close! And I think she was surprised she didn't win in the end cause her buildings appeared more impressive, so she made me recount!
My 3rd game, and all rules played correctly. This will hopefully stand strong as yet another knizia auction game. Only thing I'm a little unsure of is whether there are as many strategies within this game (compared to say RA), and whether these strategies wil become apparent after further plays. Time will tell I guess..3rd game was 4 player all with correct rules..my score winning the game at 42 vp's...the game plays so quick, you can't afford to delay for too long..everyone seems to always playing for 'pure' palazzo's...

UPDATE december 09: Well, Like many of my games these days it's been yars since I have managed to get this game back on the table. Faster than I remember with plenty of game play. So much so I think it deserves an 8 rather than a 7 rating.

I hold the world record in teaching this game incorrectly.

I was taught the "rules" at the WBC (Lancaster, PA) by a Rio Grande rep a few years ago, and I would go on to repeat his incorrect rules explanations countless times that weekend.

I didn't enjoy the game much, but I kept getting dragged into games anyway to "explain" them (oops) to new players.  I suppose it was divine punishment for failing to provide accurate information.

Played a few times (with 3 or 4 players). While the game works fairly well, it is not really original, neither mechanically nor thematically. There are some decisions to make, but overall it feels rather bland and cold.

Feels a lot like Alhambra, but:
   - It plays much better 2 player (no need for a dummy player).
   - Building your palazzos isn't as fun as building your alhambra.

Overall, it's all right but just missing that "wow, that was fun" feeling.

Although my initial reaction was lukewarm (due to thematically awkward mechanics and "change collection" sequences) repeat play has warmed me to the mechanics (they don't seem odd at all now).  In fact, for me the game has become a classic Knizia (although still a very distinct dance of player intercations) right up there with his core games like Medicci.  

So invest the time in this gem and you won't regret it.

This game is ok, but the theme is horribly weak, which ruins other parts of the game. Personally would have been a better game with a different theme.

Seems awfully clunky and mathematically uneven for an RK design. Odd situations occured throughout the game where your best move was to do nothing, lest you set up the next player for a strong turn -- but unfortunately, you're forced into these spots. Also gameplay easily bogs down in money drafting early on... there's no reason *not* to draft money over and over and over until you're through the entire deck. Sometimes it felt that whoever "blinks" first and takes a build/auction turn gets less out of their action than others who can benefit from the tiles remaining on the board after that move. And I was disappointed how incredibly derivative the scoring and structure were to Clocktowers and Alhambra. One of the least original RK games I've seen so far.

OK, so I like Palazzo, but barely.  The theme is thin and the mechanics we've pretty much seen before in other games.  Dr. K. takes everything and packages it in a new way, however.  Is it new enough for me to have to have a copy?  Probably not.  But I'd like to play this again to see if I'm missing something, because upon the first playing I wasn't that impressed.

This is a fairly elegant game, whose simplicity makes the game seem to zip by.  Manipulating your funds, buildings (i.e. victory points), and opportunities for maximum benefit provides pleasantly painful choices and gambles, since your opponents will surprise you and inconvenience you at the worst possible moment.

After 1 Play: Auction/set collection games are a dime a dozen, and this one does nothing to distinguish itself.  It's only hook is the different currencies, and Alhambra does that much more effectively.

Feels like a mix between Clocktowers and Alhambra. Also an excellent 2-player game.

What keeps it from a higher score: It's too easy to get out of a jam at game's end.

Even for me, who would pretty much bed Reiner Knizia without a moment's hesitation, the idea of winning a game because my abstract building had more windows than my opponent's was just too much for me to handle.  I will bear your children, Reiner, but not if you're bringing a copy of this to the love shack.

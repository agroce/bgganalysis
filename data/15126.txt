An easier version of ASL designed to get players familiar with the more complex system ASL offers. However, an easier version of ASL doesn't make this an easy game! The rules are still pretty difficult and the inclusion of tons of acronyms in the rules forces you to make constant use of the glossary. Not a very smart move for a game billed as an simplified version of ASL.

Second chapter in my ASL learning experience. Better than the first Starter Kit. It includes everything the first one has plus guns which do not add much in terms of playing experience (at least at the level of the starter kit) but expands a lot the complexity and insight into the system delivering a truly fully immersed experience. Again: complex is beautiful!

RATING: 7
Introduces ordnance and Guns to the ASLSK system...a good refresher even if you play ASL.

Played s10- Paper army- Turn 2 arrival of Greeks ended the Italian chance

s14- 88's at Zon. First game , US wipeout on T1, replay saw Axis wiped on T3.

S9 - Ambitious assault. Italians must hide rather than take fire.

More scenarios needed to be played to check out those with guns, but inf only scenarios are fairly dicey, but do teach fundamentals of play.

Even more over-hyped than ASL, and reveals how intrinsically difficult it is to get started with ASL.  Secondly, the rules are more about wallowing in the sheer complexity for pure pedantic compulsion, as opposed to simulating or modelling reality.

Think this basically folds in enough rules to run with the older intro scenarios from Paratrooper... I wish! A few additions required- Panzerfaust from SK3 plus core rules for concealment, shellholes, walls/hedges (incl allowing HEAT attacks on inf.). I'll hopefully test this theory on Defiance on Hill 30 soon.

Not as good as Starter Kit #1 - the infantry scenarios feel repetitive and there aren't any real combined arms scenarios to test out your new guns. Glad I got it just for the Brits and Italians.

EDIT: After a couple of plays, 88s at Zon is a pretty great scenario. I also really like Priority Target - loads of fun as the Germans.

Was a bit too much complexity for me.  The chits were very small and hard to read (especially when you had to stack them).  I much prefer the large hexes and chits of Combat Commander series that allow you to fit 3 chits in a hex.

The rules were also very...laborious.  It was hard for me to reference them and it just felt hard to read.  Maybe i was just in a bad funk, but sometimes i had to read sections multiple times in order to get it.

Played S13 Priority Target with my buddy Steve tonight.  Wow.  The elements of Force "W" were able to hold off the Whermacht's advance and protect their AA battery.  SK#2 does an exellent job of introducing ordinance to the ASL neophyte and it adds a whole new layer of fun to the ASL game.  I look foward to our next ASL night.

Picked up my copy on sale, and it has a lot of scenarios for the price, but as God is my witness, it's just not very fun.  The more units in a scenario, the more the game devolves into a mechanical exercise in dice rolling.

The rulebook, while being a very good reference is horrifically bad at actually introducing / teaching the game.  The tutorials here on BGG however are fantastic.

SK2 builds on SK1 and introduces new players to Guns, i.e. AT, INF, AA and MTR. This is also a gradual introduction and allows the new player to progress to full ASL with a lot of ease. This should be your 2nd buy into the ASL system.

RATING: 9
Feb. 10, 2010 -- I've played two of the SK2 scenarios now. I'm pretty sure the first one was Ambitious Assault (S9), where my opponent and I had to learn about guns. The most recent one was A Long Way To Go (S11).

As with SK1, I quite enjoy SK2 for its interesting and challenging scenarios. With good play, the scenarios seem fairly balanced. They play quickly and require some good thinking and tactics to win.

Although I don't own SK2 or SK3, both are on my "to buy" list. 9/10

Not as good as SK1.  Only have guns in 5 Scenarios.  Attacker has far more squad.  It's easy to grab the victory.  And LATW and Mortar is too ineffective.  We must have some vehicles to improve the game.  So, next step, SK vehicle rules.  I would like to try ASLSK EXP#1.

The Quintessential war simulation chit based game. I have yet to read the rules on this one. I did however play a few times with the friendly neighborhood nut and I do like the game. I have to admit that I only played the most simple of scenarios. 

The game just seems to have taken a back seat to the other games front and center at the moment. Especially considering the only partner I have to play against is 6 hours away and Vet ASL gamers scare the crap out of me as a major noob to a field of fanatics.

Probably the least exciting addition to the ASL Starter Kits. #1 provides the good infantry base. #3 provides the WWII critical tanks. #2... well yes guns are important, but are they fun?
However I do like the approach of getting folk used to the To Hit & Covered Arc mechanisms before introducing Motion, turrets, MPs, etc which comes with vehicles.
Reasonable set of scenarios, but really my focus if I'm going to play ASLSK is something with tanks (#3) or something simpler (#1).

[b]Advanced Squad Leader: Starter Kit #2

A Great Introduction Into The World Of ASL, And Enough Of A Game For My Taste[/b]

ASLSK#2 introduces large caliber guns, such as AT, ART, and AA guns, as well as infantry-carried guns such as Bazookas and mortars. The scenarios are generally well chosen, although I enjoy some of the terrain less than in the other Starter Kits. The games biggest issue, however, is its place within the rulebook chronology of the Starter Kits. It does not feel as dense and closed as SK#1, and not as finished as SK#3, more like an appetizer for the full enchilada with tanks. Thus this is possibly the weakest of all SK games.

Continuing in the fine tradition of ASLSK #1 and moreover, we finally have the Brits in play. My only lament - no Arnhem scenario. I sure hope it's in ASLSK #3.

If players like ASLSK #1, this is the next game to try in the series, slowly adding on layers of ASL detail in easy to manage chunks.  While the earlier game had Germans, Russians, and Americans, this game gives you Italians and Minors.  Right away players start seeing the richness of the system in simulating other nationalities, which is one of the hallmarks of the full ASL experience.  And, as in the earlier title, the scenarios are all excellent and quite varied.  My favorite, "Paper Army," is a tense chase of an Italian rearguard by Greek infantry as one of the basic infantry situations in the game.  So it's not purely necessary to have ASLSK #1 to enjoy ASLSK #2, but it's recommended.  

No, ASLSK#2 gives us the heavy ordnance and crew-served infantry support weapons beyond the machine guns, demolition charges, and flamethrowers in the first game.

The tension that players experienced in ASLSK #1 regarding Rate Of Fire (ROF) for machine guns is now present for these ordnance weapons.  How many rounds will my enemy be able to get off against me?  How many rounds will I be able to fire against my enemy?  Will I run out of ammo or break my weapon if I fire too much/too fast?  Nothing is for certain in ASL STARTER KIT!

In a nutshell, the appeal of ASL is 1) Theme-rich: playing it is like watching the best kind of war movie.  2) The KING of replayability - scores of scenarios with new ones released regularly and 3) The game play is so rich that in order to be an expert, you must truely be a student of the game.

MMP did a great job with the Starter Kits: including just the right sub-set of the ASL rules to make a more accessible game.  This is what a few players of the Original Squad Leader Game were hoping that ASL would have been when it came out in 1985.

I'll state the obvious: SK#2 takes SK#1 to the next level.  : )

I like that the box contains everything that you need to play all the scenarios: the boards, counters and a complete rulebook.  SK #1 is not required.   The rulebook is in a more narrative style than the full ASL Rulebook, some like it, most don't.

I must say that there is much tension in the game play and fairly intuitive when you learn the system.

It is the most complex tactical wargame there is & there probably ever will be. And if you don't mind (or actually happily looking forward to) reading 100 pages of rules, then this might be something you should look into.. but imho it has been surpassed by .. well by what actually?
Let's say there are much easier titles, and each has it's own shortfalls.. like CoH Conflict of Heroes, Band of Brothers & others.
ASL is using 6 different Phases to create the feel of simultaneousness.. but does only create complexity for complexity sake..

so for example in ASL you can move your units let's say around the enemy, while the enemy has no opportunity to move (they can shoot, but cannot move..). At least in CoH you could simply retreat your unit.

Also ASL knows no real hidden units, yeah you put questionmarks on counters but you still know where the counter is.. while in some other Tactical & block wargames you have no idea where the unit is..! These two things get me way more into the war-theme than to roll 6 dice to find out that the weather is not changing..

This game was easier to step up to after ASLSK 1.  The additions are relatively easy to understand, though you have to play it to find out why sticking your guns in a woods hex is both bad and good.  Nice flavor addition to the series with Commonwealth and Italian troops.  Lots of interaction for both players as shots are made and results determined.  It's hard not too end up with some role-playing feeling as a key leader either breaks and runs or rallies his men and leads them into combat.

Played this at Origins 2008 with a good buddy.Nice package - standard quality maps and counters. Rules look good. It's still ASL, though, with the danger of sucking the player into a lot of minutia and down-time during play.  I was a SL fan long ago and have played ASL in the past. I am not a great fan of the ASL system.This is a nice clean up, but really isn't outstanding enough in any sense to warrant more than your basic - sound - playable game rating. Squad leader fanatics will rate it higher. But from what I see, there is little new, just a change of presentation and clean up.Hate the box cover though...kind of bland. Had no impact on the rating though.J.D.

Another solid entry in the ASLSK series.  The rulebook is slightly improved over its predecessor and there's more variety in the situations thanks to the inclusion of ordnance.

Also worthy of a mention is the "Sgt. Bogdas" leader counter - obviously a sign of superior taste.

I don't particularly enjoy many of the scenarios in this starter kit. There's something noticeably strange about Antitank guns without tanks. Some scenarios (Like 88s at Zon) still make for a very tense game, but there is an evident lack of something... And that something is AFVs.

For a new player who only knows SK1, it might be easier to skip this starter kit. I don't think the ordnance rules are that complicated on their own.

I am really impressed by the Starter Kits.  Great job in taking a fraction of the full ASL ruleset and making a very solid ASL experience out of it.

The Starter Kits can be played by themselves for many, many years with a ton of enjoyment.  Or, a player can decide to go into full ASL and not have to unlearn a single rule.  Again, very good design decision.

Excellent. As the ASLSK1, it is easy to learn, playable, and highly replayable. I have played 3 scenarios (one of them twice), and found them well balanced, with the final result only decided on the last turn.
After mastered the rules, it takes about 1/2 hour teach somebody else to play, so it is not very hard to introduce a new colleague in the hobby.
TIP: Very useful the "SeqOP_table_SK2.pdf" found here for download.

This kit was good, but I haven't played it nearly as much as the first. I would like to explore it more. It's good to get artillery pieces and anti-tank guns, but seems odd to do so without the tanks. The extra nationalities (Italians and Commonwealth) were a nice addition. It was the first time I've played Italians in a WW2 tactical game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I just received the game and haven't had a chance to play it yet. But based on my initial impressions, I'm giving this one a '8'. 

These ASL starter kits seem like a great way to get into the game. Great bang for the buck, and it seems like this one starter kit should have a lot of replay value on its own. 

The rules book is fantastic, featuring many colored images, and many examples of game play situations. The newer rules and arrata are highlighted in a 'salmon' color (basically anything changed since the first kits rules). 

I jumped right into starter kit #2, and I am highly recommending it as a starting position for someone looking for an initial 'buy in' point. You get a good assortment of squad counters for different nations, in addition to the various guns added to the game. You may just end up buying the first kit anyways, to get the extra maps, infantry, and scenarios. But if you might only buy one starter kit, I recommend #2 over #1.

More to come after I play it.

RATING: 8
These starter kits really help ease the pain of learning ASL. Still not as fun as the original Squad Leader but this set is probably the closest ASL has gotten to recapturing the fun and simplicity of SL. I still prefer playing SL (with CoI) over ASLSK but if you are determined to learn ASL this is by far the best way to wade into the waters (but you will probably still need to find someone to teach you the game when you are ready to go past the SKs).

I give this an 8 because this is a top notch product that should have been released long ago. The rules are clear and well written with generous illustrated examples of play. The SKs give you enough rules, units and scenarios to stand on their own. I suspect that with all three SKs you could have years of fun without needing to move on to full ASL.

ASL Starter Kit 2, Guns: 

$28.00.

Pulling the lanyard on a 155mm field piece at point blank range with a 10 or less to hit and then rolling on the unmodified 30 column of the IFT:

Priceless.

Worth mentioning that at least half the scenarios are reworked versions of ASL classics. These include "Paper Army" ("Fighting Withdrawal"), "Over Open Sights" ("Totsugeki!"), "Priority Target" ("Boffors Busting"), and "88s at Zon" ("Zon with the Wind").

Not bad, definitely a good rules set that builds upon the original SL in a good way and way more accessible than ASL.  

However, I think my gaming tastes have changed... I much prefer the alternating impulse system or chit draw/card activation systems used in games like ATS, Lock and Load and World at War for tactical level gaming.

ASL SK feels a bit rigid, though there are definitely aspects of the design that I do like (like defensive fire and multiple rates of fire for machine guns and larger guns).  Might give this system another try.

Don't get me wrong. I have played SL since the old purple boxd and bought all the expansions until GI. Then came ASL - the rule book cost more than I had spent on the rest of the games!

Nearly 30 years later, I have revisited the SL phenomenon.

Verdict on ASLSK2

Counters are excellent - better than the original!
I prefer these maps on card stock to the mounted boards - easier to mate.
Great player aid and scenario cards.

Rules: You're kidding right! For starter rules look at the original SL. These are appalling - not logical, terms not included in the glossary - ELR - poor progression. It looks superb - the colour makes all the difference.

I am glad I bought it and may eventually play it - using SL rules with the addition of RoF - but I don't see what the fuss is all about.

I know that this is probaly sacrilege but for company level actions I would always play Steel Panthers, IMHO the best WW2 tactiacal game ever.

Comments concerning ASLSK#1 apply here.

Great intro package to ASL as well as a pretty darn good stand alone game.

Makes me wish I could get a couple gaming friends way into struggling through ASL.  I feel like that is what it would take for me to really get the rules...they are a bit confusing and dense.  I'll probably pick up the other starter kits (have #1, not #3) if for no other reason than to satisfy my curiosity.

>>update<<
meh...I've decided that this is a really neat system but is ultimately not that exciting to me.  After a few plays I still have a tiny desire to get deep into ASL, but whatever.  Dropped rating to a 6.

I love Advanced Squad Leader, it's a full 10 in my book. I began with the Starter Kit and it was an ideal introduction to the system for me. That said, I have to rate the SK modules lower than the full system modules because they are simply not as much fun for me. If one is going to stay with Starter Kit, by all means get kit #2 and add guns to your play. But if you're planning to move to full ASL, I don't think SK 2 or 3 are necessary. Playing full ASL rules for guns and AFVs is not much different than SK rules from what I've seen, so save the money and jump into the full system.

Wish I hadn't bought this turkey. It doesn't add tanks and then again it does as many cumbersome rules that only lead to a broken rule system that only a geek would want to memorize anyway. A&A miniatures although lite by these standards is alot more playable, learnable and a more positive enjoyable experience. Save your money as you'll have to invest enormous sums to get to a point where this system becomes realistic and fun. On the plus side the scenarios can work well with any miniatures system. Yes, I still use those.

On purely practical and philosophical merits, I really do not like the starter kits. I know they are were an attempt to bring new players into the game but it does not work. It has been my experience that many people never advance past these and the resources that went into them should have been used to produce more real ASL products. To make matters worse, an additional expansion has been created to water done the system even more. If a person is to lazy to learn the game from the ground up they will never make the leap to real ASL. In summation, playing the starter kits is lot like masturbation, it might be nice but sex with a real person is a whole lot better. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of the ASL starter kits focused on artillery. All of these kits are a complete game by itself. They are designed for learning purposes, so rules are simple and straight. Scenarios are well designed and balanced to pace learning. Perhaps, rules are too short for some issues about the system so I recommend to have a copy of the whole ASL rules near you in order to clarify some of the questions about the system. Good, but just for training purposes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Compared to regular ASL, playing a Starter Kit scenario seems somewhat bloodier. Without the concealment rules, all units are vulnerable to attack, and without snipers you roll every possible shot, no matter how feeble... and sometimes those weak shots can end up doing a lot of damage! Starter Kit games are relatively simple, fast paced, fun, and quite challenging. The Starter Kits are a great value for the price you pay, and a good introduction into the larger world of ASL.

Sure,it's ASL and all, but as a product it's pretty ho-hum. Many of the scenarios are bland and seem unbalanced based on repeated playings and ROAR reports. Two of the scenarios--12 and 13--are nearly identical. 

Starter Kit #1 was much more satisfying.

"Plays" represents any scenario from S9 to S19.

I've logged a "game played" of this game, but attached no rating yet. This is because we had an entire evening of examining all rules (this is my first venture into ASL), but haven't gotten round to actually playing this game. It just felt too awkward to spend an entire evening on this game and then not be able to log it as a played game! BTW: I'm still really looking forward to actually play this! Luckily the amount of rules necessary wasn't able to scare us away...

UPDATE: Played Scenario 9 (infantry only) for three full turns. The first two turns were slow, but game speed increased per turn 3. Very intense game, but still too young to provide a rating. Expect an 8 or better after full game.

UPDATE: Played Scenario 10 (again infantry only) and the Italians had an easy game. They were able to hold out with almost every starting unit, although some were reduced. The Allies, particularly the Americans, made the mistake of not being aggressive enough. The Italians were lucky with their ROF of their MG's though!

I like the way guns are incorporated into the system (without tanks) which makes stepping up in the system easier.  Tanks are by far the toughest mechanic in ASL to learn for both rules as well as mechanics.  This takes the SK series to the next level in a perfectly stepped manner from SK1 with very little rule additions while adding some cool new equipment and strategies.

This is my choice of where to stop if you are not looking to go full ASL unless you just have to have tanks.  Its also my choice of where to start if you only want to purchase 1 game in the series.

Another set of SK goodness. There are several really nice scenarios in this one - I'm particularly fond of "88's at Zon" - that also add more nationalities to the mix (Italians, Brits, Allied Minors). The rules follow on to the SK1 rules nicely, with Hills and the To Hit process being the two major additions.

As a true "Starter Kit" this is as high up the SK chain as I would recommend. But I still think starting with SK1 is really the better choice. It's really not that hard to learn the rules for SK1 or SK2, but actually *using* them to your advantage is a whole different story. Starting with SK1 lets you better focus on that issue, rather than spending energy counting up more DRM's.

Played a lot of Squad leader in my "Yoof". Looking forward to the Advanced version, something I have never tried. Shame about the boards being reduced to card stock...love my mounted boards, so come on MMP what about specials for extra cash.

I really liked how they invited some offbeat nationalities to the party in this Starter Kit, with the Greeks, Italians, ANZAC and Free French.  I have played most of the scenarios, and though none stand out as classics, they are a lot of fun.  "88s at Zon" and "Priority Target" were particularly nice.

More ASL, incorporating the rules for indirect fire and support weaponry. I like the fact that the new rules are actually presented as highlights within the body of the SK1 rules. It really does seem like a good way to learn this beast.

Can't wait to play with these rules, although they appear just like the original ASL rules at least to my memory. It's nice to have a concise location for all the rules.

Love the new units added to the ASLSK series with this set (really like playing Italians and minor Allies, 'cause apparently I'm a masochist), but I don't think I'll ever love how heavy weapons work in ASL.

A few more rules than ASLSK#1 but many more possibilities.

All these starter kits are a great way to learn a stripped down version of the full ASL system.  The perfect gateway without the large financial investement required for starting full ASL.  SK2 builds on the infantry system in SK1 adding guns and the To Hit process.

6/18/07 - I've only played the first scenario to date (2x) which seems pretty hard on the attackers.  I'm not sure why MMP would make such a difficult scenario the first in a "starter kit", where neither player is likely to have much experience, but they did.  I'm anxious to see how the second scenario plays out.  I like the fact that Italians and minor nations were included in this set (IIRC, kit 1 was primarily Germany vs USSR).

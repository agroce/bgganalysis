A tight, euro style worker placement/resource management game, with role selection and die-roll gunfights.  The tricky part to me is keeping track of the various, ever-changing building incomes.  A fun, interactive game to be sure.

RATING: 9.5
Worker placement, character ability selection, and tile-laying and a Wild West theme come together to make a solid if not overly original gaming experience.

Yet another worker placement game.  By this point, this would normally be a way overdone idea.  What saves this game from mediocrity is it's great theme (I've been waiting for a Wild West theme gamers game for a long time) and the different take on the worker placement mechanic.  The game lasts four rounds (and it seems both arbitrary and overly short, but I guess that helps keep it somewhat fresh) and the goal is to have the most points by game end.  It has a somewhat engine feel to it, as points generally (but not always) scale rapidly upwards towards the end of the game.

Each round, you select a character that has a special ability, a turn order, and a money holding limit.  The characters vary quite a bit in abilities and generally each have opportunites to be very good in certain situations and/or rounds.  You go into each round with some money that you start with and then that you carry over to the next round (here is where your money holding capacity is very important), and then you take worker placement actions in turn order.  There is path that is resolved in order, very similar to Caylus, and these options range from income generating spaces (which aggravatingly occur usually AFTER you really need the money), building purchasing spaces (a key use of money, and an important way to generate future income and points), point generating spaces (generally quite contested), and a few other situational spaces (such as road building, extra guns, etc.).  You also have the option to place your worker out in the town or wilderness of Carson City to purchase plots of land or to rob people's buildings of income.

The twist on the worker placement genre is that you can contest another player's placement.  This means that you are going to duel the other player, with the winner being the one with the greater firepower.  There are two ways to play this: 1) semi-random dice rolling, and 2) deterministic gun tiles.  I prefer option 2 but it's good to have the choice.  Generally you want to win a space, however there is some consolation in losing in that you get your worker back and therefore will have an extra placement the next round (the one problem is that there is NO compensation for the very last round).  There are several ways to acquire guns, there are several ways to aquire income, and there are several ways to score points (guns, plots of land, buildings, purchasing points with income, etc.).  

At the end of a round, you can only carry over so much income (based on your character) and any excess money is burned at a poor income to points ratio.  The theme (characters, gunfights, developing the town of Carson City, the buildings) really fit the theme well.  The game is a bit confrontational, but it is fun.  There SEEM to be several paths to victory, although guns generally are pretty overpowering.  Overall, this a relatively refreshing take on the tired worker placement mechanic, and it's a very solid gamer's game, with classic euro mechanics.  Looking forward to Xavier Georges next offering.

Otro más de colocación de trabajadores, en este caso vaqueros. A diferencia de otros juegos similares, en este hay mucha interacción entre jugadores, ¡además de dados!, que aportan un toque de emoción a los duelos.
El tema me gusta, la estética es bastante resultona y la sensación que transmite, pese a ser un eurogame de tomo y lomo, es bastante temática y sugestiva.
Nada nuevo bajo el sol (de Arizona), pero un buen spaguetti western nunca está de más.

First play went just fine. It is much like Caylus in how actions are resolved which leads to a similar line of thinking (I need A before B to get C). The theme is truly fun and superior to Caylus but the options for strategy are certainly less. Also, building the city is awkward in computing the value of buildings - you have to count surrounding and associated tiles with various rules. That aspect alone might kill longevity for me as it's too mathy. I really want a great cowboy game and this one is close.

Brutal euro, muy divertido y original, eso si, reglas algo confusas que hay que averiguar bien, antes de jugarlo, ya que las relaciones entre los edificios de colocación de losetas lia un poco. Euro atípico con interacción en los duelos entre vaqueros, que le pone la guinda al juego. Prefiero jugar los duelos con la version de losetas antes que con los dados, mucho mas estratégico.

A couple of more plays have shoved the true worth of Carson City. I find it a good and well designed game. While a little bookkeeping still necessary, administrative tasks are minimised to great extent. Hence you can really concentrate on playing.

Interaction between players heavier than in regular worker placements. Personally I like it.

Despite being well designed the Carson City lacks that certain elegance, and I think it is caused by too many layers upon each other. Basically, you are building an engine to generate resources. This is standard stuff. However, the part that dims the brightest shine of the game is that you actually have to take separate actions to score your engine or to buy victory points with resources. Does not sound like a big deal, but when you have a limited amount of time and actions, I'd much prefer to concentrate on the fun part of building and producing instead of trying to remember to score points at every possible occasion. For some reason this makes the game feel a bit slow.

RATING: 8
A very good worker placement game with an interesting mix of mechanics. It has a number of similarities to Caylus, but the gunfight aspect really sets it apart from that game. Unlike the typical worker placement game where the first person choosing an action gets it, Carson City allows players to fight over action spaces. The dice aspect adds a random factor, but it's one that doesn't seem to have a disproportionate effect on the game. There are ways to mitigate the luck by having more guns than your opponents or by avoiding spaces where a fight is likely to occur, and losing a fight isn't overly detrimental to a player since that player gets their worker back, which both helps them win future fights on that turn and also allows them an additional worker the next turn.

The role selection aspect of the game also creates interesting decisions that will shape a player's strategy.

The ability to rob other players' buildings wasn't used at all in my first two plays (though there were threats of it in the second), and it's an option that can easily be ignored if the players in the game don't care for that kind of confrontation.  In a 3+ player game, this option is probably a low-efficiency play, but I could see it being situationally useful if one player creates an ultra-profitable board setup that needs to be reined in.

Thematically, the game does have an Old West vibe to it.  Yes, many of the mechanisms are contrived and don't make much sense thematically, but there is enough theme in the game to make it interesting.

Why do I keep playing this? OK, so the expansion fixed the sheriff but it doesn't fix the problem with the game. Whoever is the first player on the last turn takes the only victory point spot and all the guns. Oh and with 5, one player needs to be prepared to just pillage every turn. There aren't enough buildings for 5 so the last player just gets blocked out. Also, the 30 - guns starting money is just terrible. Guns are worth much more than $1. Hope to never play this again.

5-5-12 - Initial play was with 5 (all 1st time players), and I loved it. Very tough decisions to be made as you wanted to do a lot of things but don't have enough cowboys or money to go around, so have to decide what's really important each turn. Got killed, but definitely can't wait to get it to the table again!

Played a couple more times, and while I'm bumping my rating down just a tad, I still liked it, but can see how it's a bit of a brain burner for some of my more Ameritrash inclined friends. Need to get the same guys to play a couple times to really get into some better strategies too, I think.

This game has the makings of a good fun game which will suit family (when played with dice) or gamers (when played with revolver cards). It has elements of Caylus in the concept of an ordered resolution of pieces placed, but otherwise is original in allowing more than one piece o select an action and resolving by duel. As the game hots up, the competition gets quite rife and the duels are plenty. My one minor doubt at the moment is in the power of the last "exchange 5 dollars for points" in the last round - having won both times by building towards an unbeatable total of guns by the last round. Not yet a serious doubt as more play is needed - excellent game.

RATING: 7
A mildly interesting role selection/worker placement game.  Decent number of choices in any given round, but I feel like a lot of them lead to the same place.  Not a ton of differentiation except in the buildings a player focuses on.

Primarily, you're building an engine.  Buildings --> $ --> VP.  There are a few other ways to get $ and VP, but they're once-per-round and likely to earn you far less.

Dueling adds a nice touch of player interaction.  You cannot ignore firepower, or else you will likely be stomped.  Repeatedly.  Unless you have a Church.  And even then, that just protects your buildings.  No, firepower can be pretty important.

Overall, fun but it's missing something.  I feel like there isn't a solid overarching thread to the game - no beginning, middle and end, just an incremental creep to oh-crap-how-do-I-get-VPs-again.  I'll definitely play this again, but it's not a must for me.

Another "worker placement" game! In this one the mechanism is combined with the role selection of Puerto Rico, a convoluted economic system and some dice randomness. Adding does not always mean more. I will not mind playing again, but I found it unnecessarily complicated in some aspects and failed in the balance between strategy, tactic and luck.

I enjoyed some aspects of this game, I liked the Duel mechanics that let someone else put a worker in the same area than someone else, making some classic mechanics of worker placement a little different, for better in my opinion. The thing is that you can always use tatics to try to manipulate the die results, so luck exists here, but normaly it does not define the result of a game.

The theme seems ok, but not too much, the objective of the game is to build constructions and earn money to exchange for VP, so the richer is the winner, not a really thematic game at all. The duels are the only thing here that make more sense in this old west game.

I'm no fan of the theme, but this is a very good game.  I was a bit worried after winning the first game I played by flying under the radar (amassing money), but once we all wised up to the implications of the various roles, that went by the way.  The game seems well built.

Carson City combines city building, role selection, worker placement, and tightly-themed player interaction (cowboy dueling) and comes out a big winner.

Players select a role each turn (Sheriff, Grocer, Settler, Mercenery, etc.) and then alternate turns in placing their cowboys on the board (cowboy meeples!). Players have very tough choices before them: do I place my cowboy on a promising parcel of land so that I can build on it? Do I buy a saloon for a cheap price, hoping no other players duel me for it, or do I pay a little more to make sure it remains uncontested? Do I pick the Sheriff this turn and secure my actions from being taken in a duel, or increase my firepower with the Mercenary? Do I risk fighting another player for the right to build a certain building? Do I dare roll the dice and gamble for extra income? So many choices, so much fun.

QWG's production values--always top notch--are yet again first rate. The artwork is evocative and the pieces are all extremely durable, functional, and thematically charged. There is also a genuine pleasure in watching Carson City grow from a tiny house into a full-fledged Western town. Kudos to QWG for making another game that makes you really WANT to play with those pieces!

As a highly involved strategy game, Carson City is demanding--especially on the first play--but it is worth it! Although the rules are sometimes ambiguous and in a few cases difficult to follow, the notes on BGG offer welcome clarifications.

In short: I found Carson City utterly engaging and atmospheric, with lots of room for surprise and tension in player dueling, and makes for a welcome breath of fresh air overall. Very highly recommended!

I have utterly no interest in wild west themed games; yet I'm madly in love with Carson City, which is thoroughly steeped in the cowboy theme! In fact, in terms of brain burners (which Carson City most definitely is!), it's one of the most well themed advanced strategy games I've yet played. Sure, it can be pretty cutthroat....but that is totally up to how you and your opponents choose to play: gunfights are NOT mandatory (though certainly advisable at times!). And loosing a duel (except in the final turn) does have its benefits! 
A fantastic game, but you may want to be careful with whom you play it; with the right (or wrong?) crowd of eurogamers, it can degenerate into an AP lovefest. Now, if only M.Georges will retheme it to something that appeals to me.....the North American fur trade perhaps? A viking settlement in the Hebrides?

I very much like the way this implements worker placement in conjunction with a 'city building' spatial aspect on the board. Plus, the potential of 'dueling' for spaces adds an entirely new layer to the worker placement. And I really like the character role selection. Drafting powers is a fun mechanic.

Nevertheless, there are some balance issues in how only one person gets to maximize their vp engine output in the last round and everyone else has to find alternate routes. Things can be a bit too tight and bite people pretty darn hard in the behind. Still good fun though.

- Cowboys is a fun theme for a worker placement
- You get some direct interaction, which is rare for a worker placement.
- Choosing what power you want on a turn makes it fun. 


Cons
- Very fiddly game. You have to adjust the different tiles and turn them when they need to be turned. A fair amount of overhead. 
- Shootouts are fun but happen rarely 
- It's easy to miss something on the board
- A fair amount of iconography

I enjoy this a bit more than I thought I would. It integrates mechanisms from a lot of classics in a pretty nice way. Worker placement from Caylus, role selection like Citadels or Puerto Rico (though different from each), a spacial element, etc. There's also a good amount of variety and freshness in the plays.

The spacial element feels just sort of "there" ... there may be some challenge in placing a building (lack of roads or too expensive to get the plot), but often times placements are a foregone conclusion.

The roles are a nice twist, though. Each clearly directing that turn's strategy, with nice mechanisms for managing turn order and the money carryover (thus, choosing a weaker role this round may set up a big turn).

The worker placement element is really familiar, but done well, and engagingly, with early spaces setting up later ones. Money can be really tight and the gradually escalating point costs is a great risk-reward mechanism. Duels can also really add to the interaction and really change the way a game will play out (every duel results in a "half-wasted" turn at least ... half-wasted because they'll get their cowboy for next turn) and it does very well the mechanism of giving you a reason to pass early and save your cowboys (I feel Caylus, with the cost for placement after a pass, is clunkier).

Of the mid-weight worker placements, I like this way better than something like Egizia.

An assemblage of familiar mechanics, including character selection and worker placement on a Caylus-style road.  What might have been another boring efficiency game has life injected by a fair degree of player interaction through gunfights for contested spots and some vicious struggles over prime plots of land. I particularly like the this town ain't big enough for the five of us competitiveness of a full complement of players.

The net result is a nice thematic feel of rough and tumble competition in a rapidly growing Old West town.  This is helped by some quite good artwork.  Carson City packs a fair bit into a short playing time. Not bad at all.

For us, this was one of those games that takes a while to "click".  Once you get it, though, it turns into a pretty good gem of a game, somewhat reminiscent of Caylus (which I'm a big fan of).  I think the rule book could be improved, thereby decreasing the learning curve associated with our first experience.  In many respects, gameplay just wasn't clear.  Like I said, you do eventally get it, and it is a neat game once that happens.

As a side note, I have had a terrible experience with Eagle Games.  My new, sealed copy had components that were very moldy.  I tried to contact Eagle Games numerous times, but never received a response.  What's worse, after researching the issue, I know that they've been aware of the issue for quite some time, and yet the game is still selling, and for full price at that (moldy components and all).  That is unacceptable in my book.

UPDATE (06/06/2013): Eagle Games did eventually contact me, and they sent me new meeples.  By that point, I had already cleaned all the old components, which took a lot of time.

RATING: 7
Seems heavily-influenced by a lesser-known founding father of worker placement games: Way Out West.  I find it fairly clunky (road/house placement, unintuitive player aid, etc.) and not particularly thematic.  I think the game engine is decent - if not a bit dependent on key duels - and I'm always happy to see integrated variants.  This one has a lot: an alternative side for each of seven character cards, an alternative game board with slightly modified rules, lower-luck duel resolution (which still doesn't reduce the criticality IMO), and even a real-time placement option.  I've played with all but real-time, and while I think the river board isn't a big deal and that the variant characters are generally worse, I'm still glad to have all the choice.  It makes me want to revisit Way Out West (traded away), or Caylus.

-- Rating after a 5 players game. I believe it will go up if played with fewer players --

+ Refreshing theme, and the variable profits you get from buildings is a nice touch.
- Way too chaotic. With 5 players you're always competing with someone in most of the actions, and if you get unlucky you can get a turn completely hosed. Since you have only 4 turns, this can have a dramatic effect. Owning many guns is an obvious advantage which doesn't please me much.

Lots to like about this game and some not so much.  Components are mixed (in both editions) but decisions are good.  There are multiple ways to victory, but not much in the way of adjusting a plan gone awry.  The game seems to favor more aggressive play, so who is playing will affect the outcome and the feeling the game gives the players.  It's a good game to play and worthy to have in a collection, but isn't a title that is a must have.

Well, the scores were close for three out of five of us in the end. That said, I didn't like that the end game came down to a single die roll. I am not generally opposed to dice in games; I thought that the use of dice to resolve conflict for action spaces would be interesting. Now I wish there could still be conflict, but resolved in a different manner.

Not bad but also not great. It's a worker placement game and I'm not too fond of those. It wasn't very hard to get into. Money and workers are your only resources. It's a bit weird how you get points and it takes a bit to figure out how to do well.

It is extremely easy to derail an opponent's plans.  Although it is balanced, it's not what I really look for in a game.  This could be a game of negotiation, but the western theme doesn't lend itself to that, so it ends up being a frustrating cock-block, rob-your-neighbor kind of game.

Long term play has shown this game to be somewhat of an optimisation puzzle, with a fairly rote strategy. I eagerly await playing with an exxpansion.

Old review: A superior worker-placement economic game. The duelling mechanism opens up the avenues to victory, and as a result, it's rare to be able to follow a single scheme to victory without the works being fouled somehow.

RATING: 10
I'm quite impressed. The theme is fun and fits well enough. The best feature of this game is, unlike many modern Euros and the worker placement games in particular, it has a common tile placement area instead of individual player-mats. That gives it an element of player interaction and 'themeiness' that other games in that genre tend to lack. The combination of worker placement and role selection seems a bit redundant, but it works.

Although it's not perfect. I'm not sure about the shooting mechanic; it seems like its too big a risk in game with not as many turns to . My first play had no fighting at all. Aside from that, it feels a bit too short at four times, but probably better to be too short than too long. Besides, it flows quite well.

I hope that I could find a copy of my own!

Favourably surprised.  I'm no a great fan of cowboy games, but this was nicely themed, plays well with close games.  We played with the Indian extra card.  I suspect the game would be much poorer without it, as this card means that the last player has a wider choice of cards.  So I do think this card should have been part of the standard game.  This small quibble apart, nice to see QWG hitting the ground running with this one.  Well done.

Első ami beugrott, hogy hasonlít a Caylushoz. Azóta már más régebbi játékokkal is felfedeztem komoly hasonlóságot, egyszóval nem az eredetisége az erőssége a játéknak. (Egy dolog eszembe jutott, ami talán új benne, számomra legalábbis: az akciók megszerzéséért csatázni is lehet...) De nagyon jól gyúrták össze a korábban mások által kitalált dolgokat egy új játékká. Kifejezetten jól sikerült darab, szívesen játszanék még vele!

This still suffers from the problem I have with most worker placement games, in that it has a score track, but more than half of the points are scored at the end of the game.

Very interesting worker placement game, with a really great twist: occupied places are not closed, but there can be a duel between players in order to use it!!
This is really cool and thematic.  The game mixes role selection with worker placement and some economical part, because you use money to expand in Carson City and mainly, to buy victory points.
Quite original and refreshing.

I'd prefer that it lasted +50% , that it had a bit exploration in it, and that after you had lost a duel you could place your pawn somewhere else instantly, particularly in the last round of the game. I would also like to see the attacker/dueler having to pay something in order to place his pawn in a taken spot. If these things existed it would be almost perfect.

Putting those aside, it's a very good game overall! I like the different actions and its balance. I like the building interactions and the worker placement.

The very idea of a worker placement game with a confrontational mechanism to resolve conflicts entices me. If you add other layers with role selection, a clever and simple economic engine, and tile laying, you can face and horrendous melange or a great game... and here we have the latter case! Sure, the game is somewhat fiddly, and the bookkeping of buildings income can be difficult, but the gameplay is great and it seems there are many different paths to victory.

RATING: N/A
This game had a lot of elements that I like combined into something that felt very pieced-together.  One of its greatest strengths was its short length, but for us it felt over too quickly to capitalize on some of the strategic planning.  With the design as it is, the game couldn't fit another turn in.  Fighting for the money to points conversion spaces felt sorta scripted and was often frustrating.  The elements really didn't seem to come together.  By far the most frustrating thing was the over importance of luck in the die rolls which accompany the duels in the game.  If you duel over the revolver tile and you lose that duel then the rest of your turn is ruined and all your planning is toast.  Ugh.

Fun and thematic worker placement game with a dueling mechanism that turns worker placement elements slightly on its head and does the caylus style action resolution in a less brain burnery way.  In some ways the game feels slightly shallow in that you are just doing stuff to get money (which can convert into VPs), VPs directly or stuff that gets you firepower which can be used to generate income/vps and win duels.  Still it all comes together in a fun and engaging way.  Highly recommended.

Worker placement with building tile development mechanic. I was initially put off by the dice, but the reality is it can be dampened by taking preventative measures.

Second play and one players game was cut off at the ankles round 2 by dreadful dice rolls. The variant to avoid dice would seem best.

Special characters give benifits for key tasks, build a cash/ power engine and go for the quick cash grab. A good game let down by a lousy rule book. Quite quick to play, no reason why you couldn't add another round if you were having a good time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Everything works here except for dueling in my opinion. We played that you draw tiles out of the bag instead of die rolling to determine your fire power. A bad draw here can handcuff you. I was able to see some ways to minimize the damage a bad draw causes, but it seems this element is still too random for an otherwise tight scoring game.

A real surprise for me when I first played it in Essen 2009. I'm not really fond of the western theme but with this game it really works. In this game you are settling a town in the west. It is a nice worker placement game with a lot of direct player interaction. Something that is missing in so many games. There is quite a bit of luck involved but with the tile variant you can take most of it out if it bothers you. Your limited workers (cowboys) force you to make tough decisions. Not the least of these is to go for vp's early when they are cheap (but you won't have a lot of money), or go for them later and get a much worse exchange rate. All in all a well tested game which combines a lot of well known mechanics into a solid game.

Seems like a solid game but there was nothing new - a bit of Caylus, a bit of Oregon, a bit of a few other games you could spot thrown in there. Can't see anything in the gameplay which would make this one stand out in a way that the mechanics don't.

Likes:
- Very thematic worker placement game.
- A TON of interesting decisions to make each and every turn
- Playing time is perfect.  Will take longer during first play, but can move very quickly once everyone knows how to play.
- One of the best worker placement games out there.  This one will hold up well and be around in 5 - 10 years.

Dislikes:
- Tough game to explain.  New players are going to struggle to understand until probably half way through the game
- Other players choices can GREATLY mess up your masterpiece plan
- The dueling tokens are probably not my style, would just prefer dice rolls, but the majority of players are going to like these at it makes the game less random.

Notes:
The 1st edition of this game has meh components.  I picked up a used copy of the 1st edition because of the price, however if getting a new copy, 2nd edition is the way to go.

Won as a door prize at the 2010 Boardgaming for Diabetes fundraiser.  Thanks to Mike & Waleah for hosting, and Drexoll Games for donating.

I heard it described as a more-complex Oregon.  I can see the connection -- they both have wild-west themes with Carcassonne people with big ten-gallon hats, and you score points by having your people near buildings and buildings near people.

I can objectively describe it as a "good game" without feeling at all the need to keep it.  I prefer playing duels with dice, but then the dice pissed off the deep strategists who complained about the luck.  It's called "drama", and you can still strategise to minimise the luck.  Whatever, I don't want to own a complex game that will cause complex gamers to grumble.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really enjoy this.  Love the theme and the game reminds me of Caylus and Oregon (at least how the board forms and how it pays out).  The duels can be rough and really take you out of the game if you get robbed but it works with the theme and you just need to be aware.  The first game took us about 2.5 hours with five but I would expect that time to drop some as we know how to play now.  It appears to be a lot of ways to go about winning, as well.  It sucked me in without taxing me like some games can.  I'm also a sucker for city games and this is one.

Update:  dropped to a 6.5.  Last game I played the gunfighter strategy really, really turned me off.  I'm not so quick to play it anymore, and that's a shame.

RATING: 7
Carson City as we have it is pretty good.  However, I can't help but think it could be so much better.  In particular I like the land parcel system that seems to hint at trying to buy outlying land cheap early rather than the expensive stuff in the city core.  A speculation game like that would be fantastic.  As it is, the game only lasts four rounds and money is abundant enough that this strategy is worthless.

The game is your typical worker placement with the twist that you can attack people and take their action.  I have heard opposing viewpoints on this mechanism.  Most of the time losing just delays your action one turn, which is not enough for some people.  For others it is devastating.  I lean towards the latter, particularly in the last round where you don't get another action and the point spaces can make or break an entire game.  

In fact I dislike the whole money situation.  Limiting carryover of money between rounds and slowly excluding the money to points spaces creates all kinds of awkward situations, particularly in the last round.  It often goes to whoever takes the Sherriff or the guy with the most guns and it can totally wreck a game.

However, the game is fast and pretty fun and I can always sit there thinking about an awesome land speculation game.

A great worker-placement game that takes all the things I hate about worker-placement games (like the passive-aggressive "competing" for spots), and guns them down at high noon.

From the theme onward game annoyed me.  Amount of direct conflict makes it impossible to formulate consistent strategies without constant fear of very-hard-to-predict interruptions. Later also leads to very high likelihood of grudge matches and meta-game influenced play.

Key to playing it appears to be some sort of mixture between bullying and appeasement. While this is something I am willing to tolerate in a light game such as Small World - in a game with lots of strategic dept it is very distracting and potentially frustrating. 

I do like some new things that Carson city brings to the table but I am almost certain never to play it again.

Very overwhelming at first: Understanding all the different roles, actions, and buildings PLUS trying to compete for the best roles, actions, buildings and locations.  However, one game is plenty to completely understand the mechanics and everything after that is strategy consideration.  And there is a lot to consider!  There seems to be quite a spread in VP between those players that really have a feel for the game, and those that have trouble seeing the income generating opportunities on the map. My low-ish rating is mostly from the fact that this game feels too much like so many other games that I already own and know and love.

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play. Pretty clean rules, a clear layout of action order and a euro that's actually fairly thematic! This is a game you definitely need to play a few times to estimate the balance of decisions. Novice players will get their butt kicked for certain. There's the standard fare of money and victory points, but scores will differentiate more than some other euros.

Like most worker placements there are all kinds of little dillemas but with Carson City workers can actually battle each other. Battle is decided by a single D6 roll, but you can acquire firepower to increase the odds of winning. Still, this sometimes leads to 50/50 win or lose chances and since the game only lasts four rounds, that can have a huge impact, losing all your money you wanted to convert to victory points. The swingy nature of this game when rolling a 1 losing to the other player's rolling 6 will certainly turn some players away.

It's a pity the few fiddly parts of the rules are not helped much by a lacking player reference. That explains the many homemade versions that are available in the files section.

My initial rating of this is 8.5.  I like the implementation of the worker placement/auction mechanisms, and I quite like that you have an option for duelling over the squares.  It opens the game up somewhat, and you can finally do something about that player that always seems to be in your way!  Adding the ability to rob buildings in the town is also a nice addition.  Players need to be careful that they do not fall too far behind on their meeple count or risk having lucrative buildings robbed.  The buildings are well conceived, as some (ranches and mines) want you to build in areas with little development and others want to be in the main town.  The ability to buy parcels and prevent your opponents from benefitting from them is great, and I find that trying to buy/control some buildings really start wars amongst the players (particularly the jail for the extra revolvers and the church for the ability to protect adjacent buildings).  If all this was not enough you get a role selection mechanic and a fun theme to boot!

I'm looking forward to getting this to the table again soon, and trying the "advanced" versions of the roles.

As much as I liked this it did not get as warm a reception from any of the other people I played it with.  Sadly I sold it to make space for more played games in my collection.

RATING: 8
A mix of rather familar mechanics, but they do seem chosen to fit the theme, which helps.

You have character selection - a sort of caylus building/action track (worker placement) and then a get cash to buy vps with board position being important.

But it all seems to work - I really like the fact that the worker placement is not guaranteed and you can just get into a gun fight if someone grabs the position you wanted (unless it is the sheriff)

Only one playing, but I liked it and I can see the variable setup and doubled sided character cards giving it quite a bit of replayablity.

Overall - liked it, but no so much I have to get a copy.

I kind of like this game.  I think it needs a few plays to judge fairly.  Potential problems I see are the saloons seem just too dang strong.  They need a lower modifier or perhaps not let them build the house.  The sheriff is also very strong.  Not only does he lock out a location, but he also goes first!  Whoever gets the sheriff is guaranteed the 5:1 spot at the end of the game.  Why does he get to lock out a location from combat?  I guess sheriffs never were involved in gunplay in the old west.  Finally,  I think the last turn of the game is doomed to a get the leader free-for-all where perhaps the lowest profile wins.

Seems simple in concept, but it really has a lot going on.  I like the theme and being able to contest for spots, but I think it's a hard game to play straight with the rulebook the way it is.  I'm looking forward to my next play to see if I like it better.

RATING: 9.5
The Revolver tiles for duel is strong recommended! With 3 or more players, each player draw 6 strenght-tiles at the beginning; see the rule book for -The right of the Strongest-! Then CC is awesome and when you have enough from dry Nevada country, then turn the board and play the river with bridge building.
The dice are only used for the setup of the gameboard and the Poker-Dollar (2dice) field. Metagame with unasked placement advisors for the bought houses in 4 to 5 player game is sometimes necessary, to influence players in your way. And always remember the red houses and the straights! The Gold&Gun Expansion is IMO not necessary!

Best role cards: 1st white_Bankier, 2nd white_Chinese.
Weakest role cards: 1st red_Captain, 2nd red_Settler.

Juego con cierto saborcillo a caylus, pero ambientado en el oeste americano. Es de colocación de trabajadores, pero permite además que los jugadores compitan entre sí (a través de duelos) para poder escoger una acción en concreto. Cada jugador además, participa en la construcción de la ciudad... que es lo que le va a reportar dinero. Puedes robar a otros jugadores asaltando sus propiedades.
Además incluye una mecánica de selección de roles cada uno de los cuales otorga un privilegio diferente (hay cinco diferentes). Una combinación de mecánicas muy elegante y el juego me pareció altamente recomendable. Solo he jugado una partida y ha entrado en mi ranking personal directamente con un 8.8. Admite de dos hasta cinco jugadores.

I nice little worker placement game with some area control mechanics.  Some like the dueling, others don't.  The uncertainty associated with getting dueled off a spot somewhat mitigates the worker placement "I was here first" problem.

Of course, now the player with the most guns gets there 'first'.

Didn't like this nearly as much as I expected, given the numerous comparisons to Caylus (one of my all-time favorites).  There is a LOT going on, and the interactions between the various buildings meant that there was a bit too much for me to keep track of, at least on the first play.  After my first play, I'd rather play Caylus without all the extra chrome, but I'm definitely willing to give this another try or three.

I enjoy this one, but don't absolutely love it.  I like the duels. I like the role selection and city building.  However, the game is only 4 rounds.  Just when things are really starting to heat up, the game ends. It's difficult to balance money and victory points and there's quite a bit of mental meth.  Still, it's a good game.

RATING: 8
This is my favourite type of game: a great theme married to solid mechanics. I would have given this a 9 or possibly even a 10 if the scoring was a little more consistent across the whole game; as it is, I think the end-game scoring can be a bit too significant. I would have preferred something more like 75% of my score during the game, and 25% for the end-game; whereas it was about 50-50 for me, and 100% end game for others.

RATING: 9
One of the best games from Essen 2009.

Yes, it is another worker placement game with a very famililar Caylus aspect of a road of actions that is resolved in order. But that's where the similarities end. The gameplay feels nothing like Caylus.

The conflict (duels with guns!) and scoring is interesting and refreshens a tried mechanic. (The game does not offer any new mechanics - it's role selection and worker placement). The game is highly thematic and it feels like you're settling the wild west and resolving conflicts by sending opponents' cowboys to the hospital/morgue by gun fights. Luv the nasty in this game. It's a confrontational in-your-face euro at its best.

Ignore the "duels are too random" criticisms. You can play with the tile variant (tiles should have been the standard game with dice as the variant) which pretty well eliminates most of the luck elements. I have won the game with one gun as my fire power. (ie losing every duel). 

Most of the other criticisms of this game are from pansies who can't take a bloody nose because they lost actions from losing gun fights. This game is not for those who show up at the O.K. Corral with forks as weapons. Besides, if you can't fight, the game offers lots of other balanced ways of achieving VPs. Sheesh.

Own the Master Print edition with "the Indian" expansion.

4 players seem to be the sweet spot now that I've played a 2, 3 and 4 player game. The amount of depth and replayability is amazing for its short playing time. (1hr 45m with my AP group; otherwise 1hr 15min).

Update: initial Essen impression of 7.5 has been increased to 9. After 11 games, this baby still has legs. I enjoy both the tile and dice versions of this game.

I really went in with high hopes, as I love the theme and the pieces and board looked great.

However it seemed a little on the long side for what it is.  The biggest problem is that there are so many cowboys to place, and a turn order that changes, so you're constantly having to ask "whose turn is it?".  That probably annoyed me the most.   Perhaps if players switched seats each turn it would go a lot more quickly, particularly later on.

It has potential though... certainly interesting tradeoffs between guns and production.  Open to raising this rating with another play...

A very good tile placement game where the theme of the game, wild west frontier town, feels like an valuable integrated element and no some bolted on last minute addition. Use your cowboys to stake claims, build buildings, gather money and duel other players for all of the above. While this game does occasionally suffer from runaway leader syndrome intelligent cooperation from the other players can counter that. Unfortunately intelligence ain't in great supply when you got a bellyfull of gulpin whiskey and some low down varmint has walked off with yer favourite hoor. Draw I say!

RATING: 7
Upon hearing preliminary details of this one, it was at the top of my Essen wishlist - but, like many games, once reports of the 2er started to trickle in, I was somewhat dismayed.  Even Xavier George wrote a blurb in the forums, which read to me as an apologia for what was to be a sub-par experience.  Too much open space, too little competition, and too much focus on making money.

Well, some of that is true, but the good new is, it doesn't matter.  What is true is that making money is probably the dominant strategy - whereas in the 4 or 5er there is so much competition that taking houses, plots, or guns could be a VP strategy on their own, this is not true for two.  If you aren't making money, you won't be in contention.  The good news is that there are many ways to make money, and all the other ways of generating VPs become sidelines that you can act on as contingencies dictate.  

There is no problem with too much open space in the 2er.  We've played both sides of the board, and on the regular (non-river) side, there is more space to maneuver, but that can come back to bite you in the ass (for instance, with houses being built in town being more open to opponent's use with more open terrain to build in).  On the regular board, ranches and mines become more valuable.  On the river side, the town is much smaller, more compact and cutthroat, which doesn't necessarily lead to more confrontation, but presses those sideline VPs into greater service.  Overall, there is plenty of confrontation and dueling in the 2er - you can avoid it at times, and at times you need to embrace it.  It makes the game much less chaotic and more strategic, and there is plenty of strategy to mull over and decisions to make in this one.  

This has surpassed what I hoped it would be.  Worker placement here feels genuinely fresh and thematic, and the multiple paths to victory, combined with all the variants and variables, makes this one replayable.  The games play out quick, adding to the addictive nature of this one.  I'd recommend playing with the red sides of the character cards after you get a flavor for the yellow, as the yellow sides are out-and-out unbalanced, and the rest of the game is pretty finely tuned, but the nice thing is, you can mix and match red and yellow sides to give the game the flavor you want.

RATING: 9
My favorite worker-placement game, and one of my all-time favorite Euros. It blends all of the interesting decisions presented by a great Euro game—role selection, careful timing of events, turn order considerations, area control, economic engine building, VP maximization, etc.—with the awesome addition of the duels. 

Being able to oust someone for a spot not only gives you many more options during your turn, but it also adds a level of risk and drama that rarely occurs in a Euro. It also adds a wonderful psychological element to the game, in which the mere threat of a duel can be just as powerful as the fight itself, and people will let you have your way if they know you carry the guns. It makes the game not only a very rich psychological experience, but also makes the theme emerge that much more.

Heavier game than I expected.  Lots of downtime while people figure out how to optimize their moves - and then reoptimize when someone does something unexpected.

I like the game, but not enough to keep it.  I would rather play Stone Age or Caylus.

After 3 solo plays,  I like it,  but will need to get it to the table with a group for a better sense.  I think the expansion would make it even better from what I've read, but don't want to commit to it at this point.

10/15/15: After 3 group plays,  this is an exceptional(and underrated imho) WP game that integrates its theme quite well.  The amount of re-playablility when including the Gold & Guns expansion is great.  I Kickstarted the Big Box for this as well.  A great game that makes me want to play the soundtrack to the 'Magnificent Seven' while I play.

11/11/15: Upped rating to a 9.  Action selection mechanic reminds me of Caylus and I like it better.

I've played this once so far... and we got the rules "mostly" right (advanced prototype). We all ended wanting to play it again. It's a solid, thinky, worker placement, role selection, old western, interesting area-controlish town building, with a bit of dice rolling thrown in there. 

The theme is carried extremely well which raises the dry, mechanic-rich nature of the game up to a wonderful level. I highly recommend giving this game a whirl when it's eventually published!

Wonderfully tense game, somewhat AP-prone (like all worker placement games). A lot of simple mechanics, complexly woven, with no clear hint at the outset of how to plan a larger strategy. I like how the game is so compressed -- just four rounds! -- though certain rounds are beginning to feel a little scripted. The inherently confrontational nature of the game can get a little unpleasant, especially since a single gun battle in the last round can determine the victor.

I really like how all of the players are building Carson City together, but all competing for the best locations in town in order to maximize points.  Otherwise, it's a fairly standard worker placement game with a little more conflict than your typical Euro thrown in, which I actually kind of liked.

My only concern is that a player or two can be hopelessly out of the game as a result of a unfortunately timed loss in a duel.  Losing a building or land tract at a crucial time can be fairly devastating, without much of a way to get back into things.

Still, pretty sweet game that I look forward to playing some more.

What a great game. It lived up to expectations. 

Carson city is a role selection based euro that plays in a short time frame (4 turns). What gives it a nice touch of flair is the potential for direct conflict. Gun battles add a nice layer of decision making to the usual euro optimization routine.

Sort of like Agricola but if someone chooses the action you want, then you can have a shootout with them to decide who gets to take it. The selection of gunfighter if a player has a lot of spare cowboys / ranches / mines may well be a winning strategy. There's a bit of work involved in updating all the incomes from each existing building when placing a new building.

Workers fighting for spots and being able to duel each other is a really fun twist that ties into the theme and is implemented in a fun way.  The sprawling town is fun to watch grow and there is a surprising amount of interaction.  The downside for me, is that there are only so many spaces that you can go to turn money into points (which seems crucial to winning) - and those spaces get scarcer as you ramp up your income engine and the game progresses.  It seems counter intuitive that you need to perform these conversion actions but you may not be able to if your not able to win a duel or go first.

Carson City is one of my absolute favorite worker placement games. It shares the "road" of action spaces with Caylus, but adds a city building grid, and dice tossing (!!) for showdowns over spaces if players duel at the location.

So why do I like this game so much? First, the worker placement game in general is a favorite of mine, as it keeps everyone involved and adds that tension of choices of wanting to do three things and having to pick one. But what separates Carson City specifically from the increasing number of worker placement games is that it is incredibly thematic. Players work together on building a town on the board, and you get to plan on how much that ranch or bank will earn you as other buildings emerge on the board around it. The game requires a lot of planning regarding the synergy between buildings that are placed adjacent.

All this is done in a mere four turns--that's it. You need to plan to accomplish a lot in a little time. And I don't care what some people say, I love rolling dice to settle a duel. The theme is fantastic. 

I haven't even scratched the surface of trying some of the different variants in the box (the side of the board with the river, the gun tiles instead of dice, etc.). I do know, though, that I always want to play this game, and I need to give it more love.

Update: sold this in an auction only in anticipation of the kickstarter big box edition.

A temática de velho oeste foi muito bem empregada nesse jogo. Você escolhe exercer papéis que vão desde o sherif, passando por pistoleiro, banqueiro, capitão, comerciante, chinês e até índio. Você coloca seus cowboys no tabuleiro para criar construções nos terrenos loteados da cidade de Carson City, sendo que se duas pessoas quiserem o mesmo lote, ocorre um duelo com apoio dos dados! As construções dão rendimento e com o $$$ você compra pontos de vitória.

Elementos como Rancho, Prisão, Mina, Revólvers, Rio, Estradas, Igreja, Montanhas, Casas e muitos outros estão presentes no jogo que é extremamente tenso, estratégico e inteligente!

Extremely well crafted worker placement game. Where it differs from most modern Euros is in direct conflict opportunities, and in various sources of randomness (eg. duel, outlaws). All in all, this randomness does not bother me at all, since the theme is clearly suited for it, it's the wild west after all.. Complex, beautiful to look at, but not too long or difficult. Must have. 

Malus points for the lack of corner cases coverage in its rulebook that can be painful at times. If this proves to be well balanced, it has the potential to go even higher for me.

There's chaos with the gunfights, and there can be a bit of an arms race to keep up enough guns to keep from getting pushed around. If that chaos bothers you, this is probably not a good choice.

But the rest of the game fits together well, and provides multiple paths to victory. There is no overpowered strategy, but rather there are several things you can do. 

I look forward to playing this more...and the rating may increase if it holds up in play.

Carson City is a strategic game. The game is played in 4 rounds and in each one of them the players choose a character that gives certain advantages, after that cowboys are placed on action fields on the board to build Carson city. Players can claim ground, erect special buildings, houses or construct roads. When there are several players on 1 action field, a duel is fought. He who earns most points wins the game.

Excellent worker placement / city-building game, where you can fight for spaces w/ the winner getting the benefit and the loser re-using that worker next round.  A bit too long.   Good 'n Wild Westy!

Ambitious.  Everything that appeals to me in a board game, with battles over actions and also competing for space on the board.  Too ambitious unfortunately, as all the elements don't really combine together well.

Update: Turns out cowboys defeated in duels are returned to player's available cowboy supply, not general supply. Doh! Much better with correct rules!

Not super well received by my group, which is frustrating, because I liked it. Enough to play back to back. There are a few similar core mechanics here: worker placement, role selection, and tile laying. I was a bit concerned by the dueling aspect based on comments I read prior to playing, but in my two games, I don't think the dice ever decided a duel. The base value always won. And usually one player went very strong into guns, and when you get +3-6 relative to someone else, each player adding 1d6 doesn't really change much. I need to play more, but in both games it seemed that the player who tries to [i]catch[/i] the player with the most guns loses. Need to test that some more. Double sided role selection cards is nice, for variety. I [i]don't[/i] like the "strategic" variant for dueling where each player chooses a strength from a set of tiles, a la A Game of Thrones. I prefer luck of dice to luck of guessing what the other player will pick. Actually, as I'm typing this, I was just thinking that a good compromise might be to NOT lose your dueling token if you lose the duel. Hmmm... that might work. Need to try that. Dueling basically is the way to resolve when two or more players put workers on the same spot. The board play is fairly interesting because you have a Santiago-like situation where roads have to connect to (most) buildings. But then buildings because income sourecs, rather than just points at the end,  and the income is relative to positioning of variuous related buildings. As I type this, I feel like I want to play again, which is a good sign.

Worker placement with cowboy meeples. Various positions on the board to achieve different things. Opportunity for conflict/confrontation, but variations that eliminate this as well. Seems to have some territory control aspects to game play. Two sided player board for variation. Seems like a lot of game in one box.

Carson City is a title I found hard going at first until I was explained the game, and was able to focus more on its structure. Although obvious now, what makes this game difficult to learn from the rules is that all actions are in what you can do on the action track and on the playing area. The basic game (placing cowboys, resolving them, selling off excess money) is really very simple in comparison. In fact, Carson City appears as a very generic economic engine where all tuning has been put in the actions themselves. The fact that you get a surprising number of variants along with the base game underlines this aspect. I'm not sure I like this very much: yes, it makes the game quite variable, but what exactly is the game then but an ensemble of programmable units which turned out to yield a playable result—one of several, adding insult to injury—of sorts? 

In any case, the game comes with two main variants. There are more (topological, and having less luck when duelling other players), but the two I'm most concerned with are the yellow and red characters. The yellow characters are those which are usually taught the game with. They feature rather large monetary safeguards, lots of guns, and lots of free actions. The result is that the game is fairly agressive. It pays off to be a crook by preying on other people's hard construction work. The mode of play thus invoked is not everyone's cup of tea. The red characters on the other hand force players to take a more balanced approach. There are less possibilities to get extra actions and guns; and more possibilities to obtain points. In other words, you do not duel for the heck of it, and use the cowboys you have in a more thoughtful way. This mode of play is so different from the one invoked by the yellow characters that it wouldn't be fair to award both variants the same rate. Worse, ideally you would want to play both before deciding to purchase this title. Always keep this in mind when you read someone's opinion on this game. [i]How did he play it?[/i]

The actual game is a bit of a chore, though. There is a lot of silly bookkeeping to take care of (especially in working out the current values of buildings as those change as their surroundings change) and although you do get the pleasure of viewing a city appear on the board, I find it at odds with the clean efficiency you need to emerge victoriously. There is a lot going on, but in the end it doesn't feel like an interesting challenge apart from being more efficient than your opponent. I guess you could say I feel somewhat indifferent towards this design: for something so diverse, the game itself is a bit bland. Does the game have redeeming qualities? Yes. The graphics are beautiful and you get a lot of game for a very fair price. There are tons of avenues to explore in getting the most out of your cash (or bullets), although the duelling in the basic version (which relies on a random factor) may cause a few disgruntled faces now and then. But as you would expect, there is a variant dealing with this particular issue. If you like a plethora of small tactical choices, Carson City is your game. If not, then it feels bloated and in need of a good pruning, even though it all seems to hold together quite well.

The core gameplay mechanic appears to be mutually assured self destruction. I have never felt so angry whilst also winning before in my life. This is one of the worst designs I've ever played. Rather than seeking to resolve some of the issues of multiplayer interactive board games, it chooses to make them into a feature. I cannot wait for this to leave my collection.

Extremely fun, with the frustration of losing a duel being balanced out by having more cowboys in a future turn.  Those point scoring spaces at the end of the track though seem too sparse, especially as the end of the game comes around. I enjoy building the city - although it can be a bit fiddly when it comes to figuring out income.

I'm terrible at the game but I love it anyway. Tremendous replayabilty. Even without using the variants (a variant map with a river, variant roles, variant rules for shootouts), the town and mountains begin in different random locations with each new game and then the town develops in different and interesting ways. So many choices in each of the 4 rounds gives me numerous opportunities to screw up every game but it's always fascinating to see how everything builds up. Always fun.

This was a very interesting game. Teaching the game seems a huge pain but once things get rolling it is really quite fun. There is a lot of contention though in this game and my normal group wouldn't care for it. However I really enjoyed it and look forward to my next game. 

This is a land grab/worker placement game. Being able to fight over tiles or stealing your neighbors income is quite interesting. Having a shoot out is interesting.

RATING: 6.75
Carson City is another worker placement game, although in this case you've got cowboys.  And if the spot you want is taken, you just put your man there and have a good ol' fashioned shoot-out!  Eventually you stake claims of land, cover those with buildings, and try to cash out for as many VPs as possible each round.

This game took far too long to explain (and it's in desperate need of better player aids), but then once the game gets going, it plays relatively quickly.  But that's only true if you don't have any AP-prone players!  That can make this drag needlessly.

The real frustration was not being able to appreciate how it all fit together and the rhythm of the game, so you understood how long you had to accomplish your goals. Duels felt forced, and the loser is then at a real disadvantage (One extra cowboy next round? Not a big deal.) That being said, I'm still feeling like I need to give this one another try.

This is one of the games that good on paper, but eventually fail in execution. "A worker placement game with heavy western theme and high interaction!" really sound appealing. The theme starts strong on the setup, but turn to ambience during the game. And the interaction give hurt than good. Since the amount of die rolled here were small, a big unlucky (or lucky) roll can really change the game a lot. Doesn't mean it's a bad thing, but it makes Carson city falls on party game rather than strategy games.

RATING: 7
Components: Cool cowboy meeples. Money that's easy to use. Clear iconography. Good artwork. A few things unclear in the rules (especially regarding roads). I like how the buildings make it easy to keep track of their current worth.

Experience: Solid worker-placement. Every cowboy placement counts (including witholding a cowboy to help in duels), and almost every space is desirable. With 2 players, there were spaces that were never used, but I can see these making sense with more players.

I like the natural balance mechanism of the duels, whereby the loser of a duel will have one additional cowboy to help in subsequent duels, thus making it less likely that they'll lose again. Still, the capriciousness of the duels, especially when dueling over who gets the triple-guns, can really throw a wrench in a person's plans.

The money cap is interesting. If I take an action that allows me to really increase my income, I need to make sure I can also spend that income as well, otherwise I waste it at the 10:1 ratio. The worsening cash-in ratio and fast pace of the game also puts extra pressure on me to think ahead and time my actions just right.

Carson City is a fun game. If you've played Caylus it has the same mechanic where you have a row of options to choose from and each player takes a turn choosing which of the actions that there is in the row remaining to choose from then after everyone has chosen all of their actions you then carryout each action. I like that aspect of it. Otherwise I'd rather play Caylus to be honest. But it's a nice game and has good strategy. I couldn't get many to play it as it seems like a deep strategy game. So it sat on my shelf until I could find the right audience. So I traded it.

All three games I've played have been one off of a die roll.  This would be OK if it were a luck driven game, but to have 30-50 strategic descisions be decided by a single die roll actually seems rather disappointing and anti-climatic.  Otherwise an excellent worker placement game.  I would proably bump to a nine if with a non-random variant.

Worker placement, but it's not exclusive; you can place in the same spot, and have a gunfight to determine who gets to stay.  Buy buildings to have them do good things for you; uses a Showmanager-like market where things not purchased become cheaper for next round.  I've heard it described as "Caylus in the Old West".  There's something to that, but there are also enough differences to make it a different game.

Nothing about Carson City really excited me.  Typically I enjoy rolling some dice but the combat here felt really out-of-place in an otherwise traditional Euro and can be really punishing.  There are some neat ideas and I like building up the town but there are better worker placement games I would always choose over Carson City.

RATING: 6
the meeples placement work very much like Caylus but with the important excetion that players can place meeples in the same area. If several players choose the same action, a duel will ensue to determine which one will do the action. in the basic game duel are resolved with dices and are very luck dependant (though you have several ways to in creas your firepower to add to your die roll) in the variants cards are used instead of dices for duel and you have some more control over duel. beside the luck involved with duel the rest of the game is rather strategic, but your strategies can be completly offset by a bad seies of lost duel. It definitively add tension to the game and it does suit the theme very well but I'm still sceptical with the mix of planning on the main board and the luck associated with the action you can do. in one game I lost a even duel as a result another player scored 11VPs, had I win I will have scored 15VPs. At the end of the game the winner had 48VPs!!!

Love the theme and some of the town building, but the guy with the guns can bully everyone else and take what he wants, and in many cases important plays come down to die rolls, not strategy. I like the town building, and feel the whole thing is just a hair short of being fun.  A game that I will keep playing though because it just *looks* like it should be good. 

Update: last play was the worst one yet, but I wonder if playing with five is too many.  I think my play before that was with three...maybe I just need a good four player session? (See? I'm trying to convince myself to play it again!)

Quizá lo mejor de Essen'09. Un jueguito divertido, cuatro turnos, en cada turno 3 fases, seleccionar un personaje que te ayudará durante el turno y que además sirve para decidir en qué orden jugarás el resto de fases y cuánto dinerito podrás ahorrar para el próximo turno. Una segunda fase de colocación de "vaqueros", al más puro estilo Caylus, sólo que se permite usar la misma casilla por dos jugadores, en cuyo caso habrá un duelo para ver quien consigue hacer la acción (esta es la salsita del juego). Una última fase en la que se van ejecutando en orden todas las casillas seleccionadas con los vaqueros de cada jugador. Junto con el tema de los duelos también es importante el detalle de la pasta que puedes llevarte de un turno a otro, hay que saber jugar bien el personaje que toca en cada turno, teniendo en cuenta no sólo la ayuda que proporciona, sino también la pasta que te permite ahorrar.

Es un juego sencillo, algo dado al análisis parálisis, sobre todo las primeras partidas, después te das cuenta que hay tantas posibilidades buenas que no hace falta pensarlo tanto. Perdona bastante los errores, y en general asegura un final de partida apretado. Tiene una parte "económica" en el sentido de que todo lo que haces es para ganar pasta, y la pasta la invertirás en puntos de victoria, bien directamente (comprándo los puntos) o indirectamente (comprando edificios/parcelas que después te darán puntos). Tiene también bastante interacción, principalmente a través de los duelos, y es interacción de la que hace pupita, puesto que normalmente interactúas para quitarle opciones al rival.

Un buen juego.

Improved my rating to 9.  One of the things I admire about this game is it's lack of "oh, you placed your guy here, but you didn't have this resource, and you didn't place another guy on this space, so you're screwed" which is typical of euros of this type.  (Caylus)  Plus it's got a TON of variants for extra replayability, which I like.

Take Caylus, add some dice, some role selection, and some Power Grid-style mathiness (doh! I'm $1 short!) and you have Carson City.  Not sure of the effectiveness of some of the roles and some of the action spaces (particularly those that provide roads).  Still, quite thinky in terms of decision-making.  

If you take the Gambling action space, you roll 2 dice and take $ equal to the total--you can't lose!  If only real gambling were this easy!

(played once)

Worker-placement mechanic with an additional luck element. Cowboys (=workers) who are placed in the same field, have to fight over the field by throwing dice. It's ok, but I like the Caylus worker-placement more.

The game also has some nice, light nastiness when you attack houses from other players. Might obviously not appeal to to everyone.

Nice, clever game, but it didn't really appeal to me. It doesn't have any new exciting mechanics or mechanic-combinations, and the game also has some minor info-graphic-problems, as some of the exceptions are not printed on the counters.

Very cool worker placement game. A lot of interesting twists... build mines next to mountains and ranches in the open spaces. Build in the city, but build in such a way that your buildings benefit you more than neighboring players.

There's a role selection at the start of every round which determines your special ability for that round, as well as your turn order.

If someone else wants your action space, there's a gunfight to determine the winner. The loser gets his worker back, but the winner gets to take the action.

This all works together wonderfully... it's much faster paced than Caylus (for example), and it's got a fully functional and very fun theme. Nice!

(I should mention that the rulebook is vague on some points and there was much head scratching on the first play... but the second play was great.)

[2009-11-25 Rating: n.a. -> 8.5]

Overview:
--------------
In Carson City 2 to 5 players participate in the development of the eponymous city in the North American Wild West. Over four rounds, the players try to expand their personal wealth by buying land, constructing buildings or robbing their opponents. This wealth can then be used to buy victory points. At the end of this worker placement game, the player with the most victory points wins.
Each of the four rounds consists of the following phases:

1. Choose a personality:
The game comes with seven personality cards which do have two effects: First, each one grants the players who selected it a unique bonus (like reduced building costs). Second, the turn order of the round is decided by the number that is printed on each card. So during your selection you have to evaluate which of these two aspects is more important to you in the current situation.

2. Cowboy Placement:
Each round the players receive a certain amount of cowboys. Until all players have passed, each player chooses one of the following options:
- Place a cowboy on an action square: The game board has an action track printed on it. The available action squares on this track allow you to buy a building, to get money for your possessions or to convert your money into victory points among other things. 
- Place a cowboy on a parcel: The map-part of the game is divided into parcels. You can place one of your cowboys into one in order to buy the parcel later. You need a parcel in order to build a building or to deny your opponents the benefits of this parcel.
- Attack or defend a building: You can place a cowboy on one of your building in order to defend it or place your cowboy onto an opponent’s building to attack it and rob some money later.
- Pass: You can choose to pass even if you still have cowboys left that you could use.

3. Resolve cowboy placement:
Once all players have passed, the action track is resolved in accordance with the sequence on the board. If more than one player has placed a cowboy on the same action square or parcel, a duel, which is resolved using a dice, will follow (in most cases). The winner gets to take the action or is allowed to buy the parcel, the loser gets his cowboy back for later usage. During this phase, new buildings are acquired. They will generate income and/or grant you some other benefits.

4. Generate income:
Buildings players own generate a variable income. If no foreign cowboy was placed on your building, you receive the complete amount. If one or more opponents placed a cowboy on your building, a duel follows to determine the attacker. If you didn’t place a defender on your building, the attacker gets half of the income of that building. Otherwise you duel the attacker and if you win, the attacker get’s nothing.

5. End of turn:
After phase 4 is resolved, some housekeeping has to be done (e.g. refresh acquired buildings) and the next round starts with phase 1.

Comments:
---------------
* After my first play of Carson City, I was really surprised how many cutthroat decisions you have to make during the four rounds. The game feels quite heavy and also a little overwhelming but in a good way. I didn’t expect that after reading the rules. While I like this, it might be too much for others.

* Carson City is a very open game. You seem to have a wide array of options to implement your own strategy with. Furthermore, I guess (or better: hope) there are also some nice building combos to discover. All in all it seems as if there are a lot of viable paths to victory and I’m looking forward to discover a lot of them.

* I like the addition of direct conflict through duels. It a nice change of pace from other worker placement games.

* In my opinion, this is a gamer’s game. There’s a lot going on you have to figure out and I guess a bad turn early can easily cost you the whole game. So it might not be that easy to find players for it.

* The theme and the whole experience of the game are great. I really feel like I’m building my own little part of the city and while I’m doing this, I’m constantly stressed because some of my fellows might turn into outlaws and rob me. Great fun!

If you can't take bad beats (poker term: when you lose even though the odds were very much in your favor) then you won't like this game. The gambling is baked in, and it suits the theme very well. Normally I only like luck in light, quick games but here it works very well.

Lots to like about this one.   Variants will keep it fresh for years, and it's simple enough that I can see the family playing it.   Plays fast once everyone knows what they are doing.   The gunfights are really fun too.  I can see this getting a lot of play.  Great game.

When I played Deadwood and liked it, and found out about this game, I was very interested. Took awhile to get it played. I had a 2 player game and knew quite quickly the game needed at least 3. So I refused to make any judgment until I played with at least 3 players. It took even longer to get 3 players, but liked it so much played another game right after with 4. An awesome game, better than Deadwood. I can see why Tom Vasal was perplexed when Tom and Zee said Deadwood replaced Carson City. Both are great games, and Deadwood is simpler, but Carson City is awesome and doesn't need to be replaced.

Players are investing in Carson City, out in the American West.  Four turn worker placement game, where players juggle cash, cowboys, plots, guns and assorted other stuff.  Parcels of land are picked up and developed with houses, mines, saloons, etc, which earn income, which can be reinvested into further infrastructure, or into victory points - which is what it's all about.  Busy game, very much in the Caylus fashion - almost a western version of Caylus, but with a much more interesting on board placement game, as the town is expanded.  I thought it worked quite well, but needs a game or three to get up to speed - there is a bit going on.  I have a slight concern that it is very dependent on owning guns, and even then bad die rolling can torpedo your game as you get ousted from VP spots you're banking on.  Played with a couple of rules mistakes fixed, and bumped it up to an 8.  I like this one ... quite mean, but fast and works well.

RATING: 7
The Old West theme is well-incorporated. Game puts a different spin on the worker placement mechanic: one player's cowboys can challenge another's to a duel in order to determine who has the right to take a particular action, buy a particular building or parcel of land, or simply receive a particular benefit.

Update 1/2012: Not as enamorate of Carson City as I once was, but still a very good game. Guns are too critical to success and are close to being a requirement for victory (but I guess it fits the theme!)

Great worker placement game.  The ability to "attack" your opponent's buildings and take half the income really makes this game interesting.  Yes, some positions are better than others (random board setup so it changes every time), but if you don't get the best positions, you can build up your firepower and sit your cowboys on those spots.  I think there is more to experience here, with more plays this game may move up.

I can't imagine a better approach to a far west themed euro game. 

I prefer playing with dice for the duels. I think those that say there's a lot of luck involved have not played the game enough. 

In case of 4-5 players I prefer it over Caylus and vice-versa for 2-3p.

Seems like an interesting game, and if played with fewer people it may be.  We played the second game with 5 (and the correct rules I believe) and the many many shootouts didn't make the game enjoyable for me.  Generally one person won them all and the rest of us had all our meeples to set up another round of one person winning all the locations the next round.  I would most likely rate this higher if played with 2-3.

●I like the game. It plays pretty fast, with only 4 rounds, so all decisions are crucial.
●There are so many strategies to go with, either ranch+drugstore, or mine+bank, etc. There are also role cards that offer different special advantage, which also determine your turn order in the next round. 
●What's wild west without a duel?! Duel happens whenever two or more cowboys are in the same space. It's resolved by roll of the dice or pay numbered token if you play the no-dice-variant.

Super tense, so few total choices per game. Only 4 rounds and lots of interesting cost benefit analysis make this a solid 10. Up there with Village for best overall Euro I play.

march2014edit

Played another 10 times and it seems more luck based than I care for. The pistol cards should be used instead of dice, that variant is best. But sometimes you get low pistols, high money, but the first round doesnt set that person up for spending that money, so doubly screwed. Those games make me feel its not a 10.

june2014edit

ACK, game is not good. Almost every game, whoever is goes first and takes sherriff will get 10-15 points round one, and they almost always win. Last game I had gun tiles of [0,0,1,2,4] so I had 23 money. I would trade 20 money for better tiles. Tiles are worth WAYYYYYY more than 8-15 money.

Game is not balanced. If the person has high gun tiles and goes first, first round, its about 95% chance of winning.

Another worker placement but with a twist. Most of the actions you choose can be chosen by other players as well. The result a gunfight. Whoever wins get the action.

RATING: 7
There are some things that I think Carson City does really well. First of all, I thought that the dueling mechanic was just right. Dueling is not the be all end all, instead it's integrated into the game. I was really afraid this was going to be just applied to the top of a finished product, but I do not think this was the case. The spacial building element, claims, and art give this game an above average theme but there are your requisite sacrifices made for the sake of mechanics (ex only your houses and neutral houses supply general stores). Turn order is handled well and so is the role selection. If you couldn't tell, I liked the game.

Outstanding worker placement game, like Caylus but quicker and easier. It has some "take-that" elements of direct conflict and dice-rolling that won't be to everyone's taste, although this is mitigated by the fact that you can use your losing cowboys in the next round (it hurts most in the final round though!).  Very competitive with 5 players, but an excellent all round game, with great components.

RATING: 7
Yep, “Caylus with guns” is an apt description and it gives CC its unique flavor. Without the guns/dueling aspect, it’d be just another “build a bigger money engine” game and, I think, would be pretty much indistinguishable.  This game is all about shooting holes in each other’s engines as much as building your own. I can see some people not liking this much confrontational peanut butter, however, in their Caylus chocolate.

I like the way buildings rotate (increasing their income) based on what’s around them.  This makes for a dynamic board with ways to build your income and mess with others’.  Each role has a money cap such that you may take a role and make a lot of money with it, but you can't keep more than the cap allows you. It creates a nice limitation that you need to take into consideration when planning your turn.  There are lots of ways to score VPs, so you can pick a path, but you’ll need to fight for it at some point.  Lots of tension as you try to keep your head down and hope others get into it while leaving you alone.

At the end of the learning session, me and my friends were already giving Carson City a place among the best games we had ever played. It certainly is the most thematic eurogame I know, with the shootings, the invasion of buildings and the organic growth of the city, which will show a logical and credible map at the end of the game. The core mechanism is a Caylus-inspired action track, but there is a mishmash of others here: role selection, worker placement, tile placement, area control and dice resolution of disputes; but they all fit together in a surprisingly intuitive way. Production quality is excellent, with sturdy components, cowboy meeples and the art of Alexandre Roche. This is probably the best worker placement game I have played so far, on a totally different league from [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110327/lords-of-waterdeep]other ones[/url] whose much larger popularity baffles me. It is severely underrated in the BGG rank, and deserves to be reprinted.

8 Word Review:
Fairly symmetrical Euro. Gunfights for worker placement. Meh.

Played 1 time. Rating history: 4
5p - 1

June 2014: Warren taught this to four new players. Teaching took about 20 mins (and W did a good job, I thought), and the gameplay that followed just didn't seem to justify having so much rule complexity. Also, with 5 players there was a horrific amount of downtime between turns, and downtime is something I particularly dislike in games. Maybe I'd enjoy this with 3 players (limiting downtime significantly), but I feel like one play of this was enough for me.

I saw the fun things it has to offer (gunfights for worker placement conflict), and I was fairly meh on the other main mechanics of the game (tile placement, unique roles every round - both have been done better in other games in my opinion). It's just one more parallel play euro to me.

I'd rather play:
Way out West for a western-themed game (differentiated buildings),
Suburbia for a tile laying game (lots of building effects),
Eclipse for a dice-battling game (more customization),
Agricola for worker-placement,
Puerto Rico for unique roles.

An excellent worker placement game with some striking similarities to Caylus, but different enough that it still deserves its own place in my collection.  While I slightly prefer Caylus, there is a lot that's different in this game that I like:
- It's about half the length of Caylus
- There's a strong spatial element as Carson City is built up from a small hamlet to a thriving western city as tiles are laid down throughout the game. Deciding where tiles are placed is hugely important.
- There's significant luck in this game, which I actually like, especially combined with the fact that it can be easily mitigated. There are enough spots where dice comes into play that there's a good chance it will balance itself out, making luck less of a factor rather than more.
- The added interaction of the duels is pretty cool. I like an extra helping of direct conflict in my euros.
- The game is saturated in theme.

Aki meg tudja tanulni, azt zavarja a kocka, akit nem zavarna a kocka, annak valszeg túl bonyolult.

RATING: 7
I'm not too keen on the fact that placing first on an action space confers no advantages in terms of who ultimately gets to take that action (it all comes down to the duel and turn order). That escalates your dueling strength from an interesting element of the game to a constant obsession. Thematically, as well, it seems the cowboy arriving first would have some sort of positional advantage. Anyway, I like this game just fine, but the inability to execute much of a plan because of the looming threat of duels gets old.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
If you disregard the duels Carson City is a pretty standard, run-of-the-mill worker placement game. The spatial element of building the city on the board is something I haven't seen before but still feels somewhat rough around the edges.

Staking your claims and expanding the city is mainly a question of optimisation and requires careful planning. When other players can ruin the best plan with a lucky roll of the dice, though, that quickly ceases to be fun, especially if you'll sit by the sidelines for the rest of the 90 minutes afterwards. For a game of this length and depth the duels are just completely out of place. Without them, however, the game is nothing special at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The old (wild wild) west. I bought this game based only upon the theme and it didn't disappoint me.

Each player choses a different character each turn. Each character has it's own ability.

Carson City, like many other games, functions through actions the players have to chose from. Each action (exceptions are made) can only be played once. If multiple players desire the same action they duel for it. The outcome of the duel desides which players gets to play the action but also infuences the outcome of future duels.

Basically you get to create a town of your own in the old west. Other players get to influence the income you create with the buildings you place on the board.

Each time we play Carson City we have a good time. However I rate this game at a seven rather than an eight because the game is better played with three or four players rather than two. And most of the times we play, it's with two players.....

Cowboy Placement mit Charakterkartenwahl und Legespiel-Anleihen. Dabei fügt sich der Wild Wild West für ein Eurogame durchaus gepflegt in das Erdachte. Lediglich die Berechnung der Einkommen ist ein wenig fummelig und rechenhaft. Die Schießereien geben dem Spiel die anarchisch-saloonhafte, interaktive Western-Note, mit Plättchen statt Würfeln entscheidend weniger glückslastig beim Pokerspiel mit der Hand am Colt. There is no room to hold love in my heart while I'm holdin' a gun in my hand. Die Master Version von Quined mit Alexander Roche in der Design-Kutsche sieht super aus, die Erweiterungen mischen diverse Komponenten neu.

It looks very nice, it's well balanced, fairly deep and takes a reasonable amount of time. The reason why I don't like this more is just because I am not a huge fan of the worker-placement mechanism.

With the few Wild West games out there, Carson City really fills the niche.  It really keeps with the theme of building out a city with all the old-timey types of buildings you would expect.  All the rules feel integrated and balanced and although it appears as a Caylus ripoff, it feels as much as Caylus as Thunderstone feels to Dominion.  It really is its own game and has a lot of smarts going for it.  There's a bit of AP that goes on due the number of choices to make, but for the type of people that like this openness (like me!) this really isn't too much of a problem (as long as you have patient friends). Can be a mean game with all the duels!

Fun worker placement game that fits the wild west theme very well. Feel that character cards are uneven but can't quite put my finger on why. Maybe I just need to play it more. Duels is definitely the best part of this game. Not for the faint-hearted or people who hate confrontation in their game.

Rating based on online plays:
- Very solid worker-placement design.
- The one thing that I really dislike in games is an action: pay X to get Y VPs. Come on! The whole game is thematic and cool and what really is important is how good you are in converting money to VPs. And it's in the very straight manner. Pitty.
- The rules of the buildings are thematic but very convoluted.

EDIT
Indeed, rules concerned around the buildings have to be learned, however, the game is tight and interesting from the beginning till the end. Good one. Need to own it. :)

I can't decide if I like it or not after just one play with two-players.  The board felt HUGE with only one opponent.  I need to play this again with more players.  A bit too much like Caylus for my liking - and I don't mean that as a complement.  

I will say that the game is very short, although whether that's good or bad depends on your opinion of the game, I guess.

RATING: 7
For some reason, thus far, I just can't seem to garner interest in this game.  It's a nice change to be able to challenge someone via shootouts for position in a worker placement game- fits perfectly here & is what makes this game stand out- otherwise, it feels like a fairly ordinary worker placement game. Constantly having to check the values coming in from buildings is a pain in the ass, while building them is kind of boring.

Lots of interesting potential elements...but just unfinished (like it could have used another 6 months of development). The mechanisms do not come together into a solid game, and some of them (like the land ownership model) are directly counter to the theme (since you don't get money for other people's buildings, you don't want to build near them). Very pretty though!

RATING: 8
After two plays, my first impression is very positive.  Plays pretty fast, offers lots of tough decisions, and the theme is excellent.  Has a lot in common with Caylus, but feels quite different in practice (and plays considerably faster).

I prefer the "might is right" official variant, in which duels are resolved by simultaneous selection of number tiles from each player's limited supply.  The standard rules simply use dice rolls.

It seems common to have the game come down to a dice roll on the last turn, but hey, that's life in the old west.  Besides, there are less luck-driven variants and worker placement games for those who want that.  To me, this has a great balance of theme, game, interaction, and surprises.

Interesting twist on the worker placement genre; our first game was decided by close-run gunfights due the limited scoring opportunities in the last round which gave a bit of feel of lots of thought and planning going down to a few die rolls.  Will see how the next game goes.

Whoo-Wee there's plenty of direct conflict in this game! Stay away if your headdress feathers ruffle easily. Lots going on here so there's lots of scoring rules and placement options to remember (or forget in my case) if you're new to the game. Still, the building and encroaching upon of Old West towns, the gambling, and the gunfights add up to a full-bodied Euro with a strong theme.

Carson City was at first just another eurogame for me, quite similar to Caylus and with nothing special. I did hate the duels using the dice, and I considered it a bad Caylus with some ameritrash touchs. Stupid me. After some time I used the non dice duel variant and I understood the value of the diferent buildings and the risk of duels and then I liked it. Different than Caylus, fast game with a lot of western feeling (way more than Homesteaders, the other Western game I own). Carson City is more difficult to play correctly and I think it is a game more for gamers than non gamers, but its theme helps a lot when you want to try it with a non gamers group.

This one is a hard one to rate for me. I give it an eight to begin with, but it can go either up or down with repeated plays. There is a great atmosphere in the game with some cool interaction combined with typical euro mechanics. The game offers much strategy to pursue, but can at times be pretty brutal because of the gun fights. It can be an arms race and sometimes it might be better to not go into the fight for that.

My rating is probably lower than what my enjoyment of the game would suggest. However, Carson City is a good game marred by a pretty poor rule book and some clunky placement and scoring. I'd like to play this again as I think it might be a bit more intuitive upon a second play. I'm glad someone in my game group has this as I want to play it again, but it's not something I'm jonesing to play again.

Another worker placement game in the vain of Caylus? Yes and No! There are similaryties but also differences that make the player use different tactics and strategies as in Caylus. No resource collecting except money. Increased interaction because of duelling. ok, it has dice rolling which can lead to frustrating moments, but then there is the Guntile variant. Nevertheless this game works and offers some nice variants too. All in all the theme suits well and I had a tensionful first game with 4 players. The start player has advantages over the last one in the first round, there is no compensation mechanic for that issue which is a bit sad because all other mechanics are well balanced.

Learning this game from the rulebook was kind of a beast and probably soured my experience a bit on the game. It was a fun worker placement game with some light card drafting and tile-laying elements. It has a lot of the ingredients of a game I like but it took me 75% of the game just to understand the rules to the point that I could focus on strategy. This one needs another play and I suspect I will like it a lot more once I've played it again. It would've been a much better experience if it was taught to us by somebody who knew the game.

Neat atmosphere, but SO dependent upon luck.  In one game, a player doubled his final score based on the roll of one die.  Too much can be taken away from you in an instant.  The system virtually nullifies planning and places too much emphasis on rolling the dice.  A shame.

Very nifty, but I fear it is too long. Shockingly both like and unlike Caylus, but adds a cool spacial element on the map. Some object to the duels, but I don't think they're too swingy.
But yeah, too long. The final turn, in particular, is weirdly calculation and skewed by whoever gets the triple gun. 
I am strangely keen to try the real-time variant, as it would shorten the playtime and reduce the AP of the last turn.
[EDIT] Okay, for my money the real-time variant is a no-brainer. It addresses both the game's excessive length and the craziness of the duels. The dueling tiles I could take or leave.

Tried this again many years later, but I'm still not sold. It's a fine game that needs a few plays to get into it. That however didn't change my feelings about this game. It just doesn't catch me, even though I don't know why exactly. I guess it comes from the duel stuff, which somehow doesn't fit the game (talking about the way it works only). I would like to have the guns as another currency, so that you have to use them, as that would open up for some more interesting gameplay.

Anyway, it didn't catch me when it came out and this didn't change 5-6 years later, so more space for other games in my shelf.

Joc de col·locació de treballadors al estil Caylus i de col·locació de losetes en un mapa.

A més, incorpora elecció de rols al principi de la ronda i ofereix moltes maneres diferents de puntuar, el que augmenta el nombre de posibles estrategies.

Molt "sesudo", pot tendir al "AP" si es vol optimitzar cada acció. El joc bàsic amb daus per resoldre els duels pot resultar massa atzarós, la variant amb losetes és molt millor.

Played again with dice instead of duel tiles, and variant roles. Far better. So many paths to victory, tough choices in 4 short rounds makes it euro without much elbow room. Constant direct player interaction where loss isn't (usually) crippling. Much better than I initially thought. Not a game for those new to worker placement though, the brevity of the game makes it important to start moving for victory early, and the paths to victory aren't immediately obvious. But with some experience, a grand old time.

During my first try at this, I suddenly realized how fast this game is... there are only 4 turns!  There are so many options each turn that it confuses the issue that unlike other worker placement games (Caylus, Agricola, Le Havre), there is no time to do anything but grab points as fast as you can.  You can't develop a long-term strategy, because the game will end before you can set it up.

For example, if you don't get a ranch down on the first turn, it's seriously debatable whether you should ever get one.

I'm not sure I'll ever get to play this game enough to test out all the different strategies, especially since it takes a lot of explaining to introduce newbies to the game.

RATING: 5
This is NOT a brain burner, and could easily be accessible to the entire family.  It may be a little long to explain initially, perhaps due to the impact each Building/House placement has on the value of adjacent Buildings.

This impact makes the game quite interesting, as the denser the town's core, the more expensive it is to buy land at that location!  At the same time, it's a great spot for the placement of a Bank or Saloon!

The forced placement of houses whenever buildings are placed (except for Mines and Ranches), makes this system work quite nicely.

"Role selection" is fairly straight forward, as the character you select will give you a bonus of some sort, but will also limit the amount of cash you may carry over from turn to turn...

One of the finer aspects of this game is that you are never out of the running, there is always a different approach or strategy you can use!  Multiple combos are open to you (Saloon/Hotel, Drugstore/Ranches, Bank/Mines, etc), and you'll also find spaces to generate income should you be short.

The "road" approach (actions are conducted one space at a time along the "road") makes for easy turn resolution, and each space is placed intelligently!  For example, buying land occurs before you may purchase buildings, and income only comes AFTER these buying phases, so you better have kept some money from the previous turn.  But wait, after income you may purchase the all important points!  What to do, what to do?!

And I almost forgot, there are also "Show downs" a.k.a duels, as only ONE player may perform each action (except for 2 which may be performed by multiple players), so if more than one player placed a cowboy at a location, the duel is conducted by a single die roll (adding your "fire power" rating as a bonus).  The winner may conduct the action, the looser(s) receive their cowboy, which may be used at a later turn, and which immediately provides you with a "fire power" bonus.

Ohh, and there are only four turns...

There is one thing I really dislike, and it's the fact that very few points are scored in the few 2-3 rounds, so you end up with a large amount of points scored in the last round... Makes for a rather un-rewarding ending.

Generally, I am not really a big fan of worker placement game. Carson City surprised me - it is actually very fun. It takes a game to become familiar with rules, especially the ones related to the various buildings. It is not really compliated, and I would say it is easier to teach than a lot of other games, such as Puerto Rico.

This game is also great for 2 players, although tension and competition increase significantly with 3-4 players, as you are forced into more duels.

The game has multiple roads to victory, and replay value seems high, given the random location of the city center and the mountains.

I am a bit burned out on worker placement games but didn't find this one as intolerable as some others. The theme helps set it apart and theme felt better integrated than many Euros can say.

I'm still not a fan of Euros that introduce a tiny bit of randomness. To do randomness well you need to have lots of rolls so they balance out. I think Stone Age does a pretty good job of that. This -- and Vasco de Gama -- don't really.

What a shame this wasn't invented before Caylus. The picking actions along a track mechanism has been lifted wholesale, but the building takes place on a 2D grid.  Thematically it's richer than its predecessor, but the die rolling for 'gunfights' does add extra randomness. The scoring is tight after four rounds, so winning really amounts to not wasting any actions in fights you can't win. The sheriff role is ridiculously powerful given that it guarantees you first action and an undefeatable placement to put on the best cash-vp conversion space. In all, lighter and more fun than Caylus, but less determinism in the outcome.

Did not enjoy this much.  Do you really want to be kicked off an action in a worker placement game?  I also didn't like the mechanism whereby some players are simply not allowed to score points.  Or how it's possible to create something to build up your economy and then have it incapacitated by another player.  

Also, why is almost every game set in the Old West about gunfights?  (1 play)

First, nice ideas in the game but a disaster in general : too much frustration comes from the duels, you can be bumped out of everything. Frustrating. Frustrating.  Frustrating.  

Second, the expansion cards are just too powerful too unblanced. Too bad, 3 because of the ideas in the game.

Too much gambling there. Will never play again.

Un juego con mucho potencial que parece inacabado. Lo situaría entre Stone Age y Agricola en una escala de dificultad. Combina varios mecanismos (elección de roles, colocación de trabajadores...) pero al contrario que otros "juegos-compendio" el conjunto no es superior a las partes. El núcleo del juego son los duelos (dos o más trabajadores situados en una misma casilla de acción se baten para ver quién la realiza) que se resuelven con unas losetas repartidas al azar numeradas de 0 a 5 (junto con otros modificadores). Esto obliga a pensar en varias estrategias, lo que sin duda no es malo. Puntos fuertes: hay interacción "de la de verdad", elevada rejugabilidad (dos tableros, dos variaciones de cada personaje, disposición inicial aleatoria...), perdona más que Caylus y Agricola. Contras: explicación compleja, algo corto para mi gusto.

I want to like this game more than I do.  It has several interesting mechanics, but I do not enjoy the dueling aspect of the game, which involves random dice rolls and can destroy a player's turn.  Unfortunately, dueling a big part of Carson City and it overshadows the mechanics that I do enjoy.

First played on January 26th, 2011. Taught in 10min, played in 2 hours with 4 players. Each player begins with some money, a gun, a road, 3 workers and a plot to be placed. The grid is setup with default town center and mountains. Game is played over 4 rounds with scoring at the end of each round. At the start of each round, players get additional pawns from their supply too. Players choose a role that determines play order later and peforms a special ability as well as $ limits at the end of each turn. (1-Sherrif; special pawn can't be placed with, 2-Banker; $9, 3-Factory Worker; $8 or 2x money in scoring, 4-Builder; 50% off buildings and 2 free roads, 5-Farmer; one free plot, 6-General; one/$1, two/$4, or three/$9 additional workers from supply, 7-Outlaw; 3 guns). Next players place their pawns one at a time on the item track. If they pass they go in line to determine order for grabbing roles next turn. Each player may have different amounts of pawns. Once all players place their pawns (or pass) then determine who wins items. Some items are not fought over and are awarded ($4 or 1 road). Others are battled over if multiple colored pawns exist (3 guns, 3 roads, etc). Players each roll a dice and add that number to the amount of guns they have to determine who wins and who send their meeple back to their play area (not the general supply). Other spaces are for tiles (mines, bank, ranch, salon, prison) to be placed on the board, $ (based on plots owned, guns, or dice roll) or VP (so many per plot, guns, buildings and $). Players may also placed pawns on the grid to make a claim on a location (may also be fought over). Players may make claim to an unclaimed house or mountain worth 2VPs at the game end. To place a tile, a road must be placed such that the road exends continous from the city and touch at least a corner of the tile. The tile must also be placed on an already claimed lot. Tiles are worth various points per mountain, mine, empty lot, house, etc. Some tiles have a red house designating that it should be scored as a house. Some tiles allow you to place a house when the tile is placed. Tiles are rotated such that the VPs are represented based on the number of houses, etc. At the end, the player the the most VPs wins. I'd recommend this game for those who like more complex games with lots of options. It tends to be a slower developing game with lots of decisions to be made. For those wanting more fast pace gameplay, may want to look elsewhere.

Carson City was massive disappointment for me because I am a fan of the designer's other games, particularly Ginkgopolis and Troyes. A primary distinctive game design element in Carson City is the ability to challenge other players' workers they have already placed by placing one of your own on the same space, which will create a duel. Each player counts the guns they currently have plus the number of unused workers and adds 1d6. Highest total gets to do the action, loser gets their worker back with no work done. Ties fall to turn order. I hate this new take on worker placement, where players are not excluding one another from actions, but have to be prepared to get jacked but subsequent players every time you place a worker. You better be strapped. This is a mean game. Also, the die rolling adds a great degree of randomness as well. I did not enjoy Carson City at all. I will try it again one day.

This game gives the best (fun+thinking)/playing time ratio.

If you think this game depends so much on luck, think again.

It took me a few plays to realize that the luck factor is low. Much lower than the pillar of the earth.

The more I play, The less luck seems to affect my play. (And YES, I am talking about the dice not the variant.)


Sure if you and your opponents score are very close, luck may decide your faith. But isn't it realistic?

Great game, and it's big fun to finally see a worker placement game where you can challenge someone else's spots instead of just having to accept the fact that that place is gone. I like it! Dueling is implemented very well, even though I hate those dreaded dice. But you just need to find a way to bypass the "randomness" of the dice by manoeuvring yourself in a good position when the dueling starts. The winner takes it all, and if you lose it all it may be a tough nut to crack but it's never a game breaker. 
Can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 7.5
Avoids the biggest problem I have with most worker placement games: not enough player interaction. Instead, this has a ton of it, not just in the robberies and gunfights but also in the way the town develops. Love the theme. Really like the option for so many variants: the river side of the board, the alternate roles, and the "New Beginning" expansion. 

The rules seem like a real info dump when you teach it, but everything is pretty intuitive once you actually start. Still some definite fiddliness with all the components (money, roads, buildings, houses, guns active and inactive houses), and this is one of those games where I really don't like being the banker. 

Really want to try the Kit Carson variant.

Buenísimo euro con montón de interacción.

Se trata de un juego de colocación de trabajadores ambientado en Oeste. Desde los materiales hasta los duelos hacen que el tema no se sienta pegado. Cada jugador tiene unos vaqueros que va colocando en las acciones que se pueden realizar, pudiendo ir más de un jugador a realizar esa acción, por lo que se producirá un duelo. 

Para mi, muy divertido. Eso si jugando con los dados para resolver el duelo, esa pizca de tensioncilla es muy de agradecer.

Además al inicio de cada turno se elige un personaje que te da una habilidad y un límite de dinero a guardar de turno a turno. Y es que esa es otra cosa que está muy bien hecha. Se gana cambiando pasta por puntos, siempre se tiene un cambio de 10 a uno pero hay cada ronda unos espacios de acción que quien se lo lleva puede hacer un cambio mucho mejor, a pelearse por ellos tocan ...

Tan solo por los personajes que incluye la expansión Gold & Guns ya merece la pena. Abre un mundo de estrategias por la cantidad de sinergias que tienen los personajes con las acciones

La expansión de customización de inicio es una vuelta de tuerca más. Solo para jugadores que conozcan bien el juego porque una mala elección al inicio te puede pasar mucha factura

El personaje del Indio me mola, me parece curioso

Wow!  Impressive design.  This is a very meaty and agressive game.  A mix of economy game with flexing your muscles in the Wild West.  Definitely not an easy one to play well.  Nothing for casual gamers.  Mechanisms interlock together _very_ well.
  Great replayability.  Every game can be different.  

Play only variant without the dice (some people claim that even then the gunfights are too random - but that's a pure bullsh*t).

Worker placement:role selection:city building:screwage:blind bid(combat non-dice rule)

DO NOT PLAY WITH THE DICE PEOPLE HELLO?  

Have you not learnt anything from the old RISK days? Monopoly? Do you really love dice and luck?

Really two ways to play and you choose the HIGH luck version and complain after?  NINCOMPOOPS! :P


Yes well, now that I got that out of my system there is a really nice little system here. Don't believe the haters, mostly unwarranted complaints is all I see so far although people who dont like some screwage might just do better to avoid this (its not really high but its there to be sure)

Yes there is a little Caylus with how the road resolves in order and of course the worker placement but the game does not feel like Caylus at all and the theme really comes out very nice in this game, I was put off by the Caylus comparisons but to me this is a non-issue and the game feels quite original even though there is nothing really new. 

So in the old west players are fighting for land and good land plots and trying to gain as much income as possible over only 4 rounds with only 4 - 8 cowboys to use per round. In turn order roles are selected to help you in the round and then buildings are laid out on the road. Players can attempt to buy the buildings (sliding scale) but other players can also try to claim the same building. This creates a duel and a player adds up his fire power and plays one of his handful of tiles (numbered 0 to 5, randomly distributed, slight bluffing aspect, extra money given for low gun count) against another to see who will buy the building, loser gets his worker back to use in the next round and it counts in the current round as +1 fire power. Note that these duels can be a little tricky to judge in the first round (there shouldnt be many anyway) but as the game progresses they usually become easier to calculate and can even be quite deterministic. Losing can hurt for sure even though you get compensated and that is part of the theme and game, it stung me more in my second game than the first and it hurt my income. If you are low on guns planning can be pretty tricky since you are never sure which things might be fought after, this might mean passing first to get first pick of character in next round to help with this.  

Cowboys can also claim new land plots and these are needed to build the buildings on. Certian spots are more lucrative than others due to surrounding buildings but only neutral and your own buildings will help. Buildings generate income and at the end of each round there is an option to buy VP's if you visited the "VP store"(hehe) and did not lose a duel there.  Buildings are also subject to duels so if someone is making a pile of money you can try to get your share unless 1 of the 2 churches is built near by which ensures peace. One thing I noticed is by taking the Sheriff someone can lock down the only VP spot left in the last round, because only 2 characters let you keep more than 30 dollars, this seems like it "could" be too strong but possibly not. You can buy up land for points but this costs you one action per land, more play is needed to see if this is balanced. Again careful planning is needed here as you dont want to be throwing away money or doing lots of high conversion to VP's.  

Essentially thats the game.  Its a nice mix of strategy, tactics, theme, high interaction and fun all in 90 Minutes. It looks like there might be multiple paths here, Guns look very important but someone won our last game with only ONE gun LOSING most duels so planning is rewarded here and there are other ways to get VP's like how much land you own, etc. The role that doubles your land seems very powerful and you might have to "take one for the team" to stop someone from getting too much income, wasnt crazy about this one aspect (not sure how big it is yet) but there are a couple other ways to try and combat it as well like stealing the income. 4 most likely the best number for this, 3 and 5 should be okay but 4 best I think (just the right amount of competition)

RATING: 7
First of all, I want to say that I only played with the yellow sides of the characters, but if they were the only ones that existed then I'd probably give the game a 6. So the 7 rating is speculative and based on using the red sides of the characters.

The game itself is a fairly simple worker placement, get money through board actions and through building buildings that generate income, and then buy points with that money, at a rate that gets worse as the game goes on. Actually you can only convert money to points if you take one of those worker placement spots, which slowly leave the board as the game goes on. And otherwise you have a max amount of money you can take into the next round, and any excess gets traded to points at an awful rate. There's some fun to be had on the board figuring out how and where to build the buildings to get income. But the problem is there's really only the one way to get points, to buy them. There are a few board spots that might be worth a couple of points by the end of the game, but that's a pretty small portion of the points you'll be getting. The twist on worker placement here is that you can kick people out of spots that they get to first if you duel them. But the problem with the yellow sides of the characters is that the person who gets the sheriff gets first choice of a spot that can't be dueled, and then the outlaw comes in and puts himself in a position where you basically can't beat him in a duel, so he gets whatever else he wants. And then the other roles are a bit underwhelming. On the red sides the outlaw gets less firepower and the sheriff instead of getting an extra, unduelable worker gets an extra point scoring opportunity. And most of the also-rans from the yellow sides also get unique point scoring opportunities on the red side, which seems like it would make the game a bit more varied than just maximizing income and then taking either sheriff or outlaw to get one of the good conversion spaces.

Has an old-west feel, but there's too much going on. Is simultaneously too long and too short (you've just built your empire and game over). Role selection and action resolution work well.   I retired undefeated  (1 - 0!)

RATING: 6.5
Rating might be unfair.  This rubbed me the wrong way because of the semi-convoluted payment system.  There's a helpful player aid, but it's missing a crucial set of information - which buildings score only when they're adjacent to you (vs. anywhere on the board), and which buildings score if they're not owned by either player.  That made for a LOT of stopping to consult the rules, a LOT more AP than necessary, etc.

Also, I'm pretty sure we were not doing something right, because we didn't have a single duel in our 2P game.  Too many other things to get done in the limited amount of time.

Pros: game length (aside from AP issues) was generally good.  Theme was well integrated - the city expanded as it should have.  TONS of replay value here, even absent all the chrome rules and variants (due to the board setup, and the way building tiles come out.)

Cons: aside from what I noted above, the components are a bit dodgy (board is bubbling in a couple spots where it wasn't glued perfectly).  Typical Eagle Games fare.  

It's quite possible I play this a couple times more, everything clicks, and it becomes a 7.5 or an 8.  But it also might not hit the table again after that first experience.

Fun worker-placement game with a bit of randomness and direct interaction thrown in to fit the theme. I liked the game quite a bit, the other players were more so-so. Love the game's potential for variants (and I suspect the chits-instead-of-dice variant might fit the game's other mechanics much better than the die-rolling).

Components are beautiful, but I found usability a bit lacking - in particular I found it difficult to see what was going on in the city (who owned what, what kinds of buildings were where, that sort of thing).

Also, while the rules read easily enough, they are horribly vague. The general concepts are there, but a lot is only implied, and corner cases aren't covered at all. Too bad, but hopefully Q&A and FAQs here can make up for it.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (September 2010)

It’s been years since I played Carson City and I want to play it again soon to see if I can appreciate it better.

I remember I liked the game, very reminiscent of Caylus (a game I love) BUT at the end Carson City left a bittersweet taste because I didn’t really like the luck inherent in the duels. In a WP game when you take an action you should secure that action IMO but that’s not the case in Carson City (I know many people love this feature). Here, you can fight for actions and you can use guns to better your odds but still I have seen a player with many guns lose because he rolled a one and the opponent rolled a six. To be clear I’m not against  fighting over spaces (love Vanuatu), I’m against the luck of the duel die that (somewhat) prevents you to plan ahead with some confidence. I have to play again to see if this continue to be an issue for me or not.

The theme is nice, but it doesn’t do anything for me as I have zero interest in it. The game components are outstanding and I love the role selection. 

To conclude, Carson City is a good WP game. I need to play again soon to properly comment as I have forgotten many features of the game. For now, I’m rating it according to my current feelings toward the game, but Carson City has a lot of potential so it will probably go up in my personal ratings. I have been trying to buy it, but nowadays it’s hard to get.

Current Rating: 6.5

At last I got to play Carson City again and I enjoyed it. The duels continue to bother me, not only because there are some luck inherent in them, but because all players can gang on a player, usually the perceived leader and it is very hard to do well when all other players are dueling you for your spaces all the time. I have fallen out of love of this mechanism (take that mechanism) because I´m the target 99% of the time, even if I´m in last position :angry:. Still I enjoy the game and the luck factor can be (somewhat) controlled with the firepower (guns and unplaced cowboys). Also when you lose a duel it isn’t the end of the world, you will get your cowboy back for the next round, so to summarize, I feel losing a duel isn’t as damaging as I thought before.

I love the variable setup adding to the replayability factor and I also love that the characters have another facet. I want to play with the red side soon.

Bottom line, I enjoy Carson City and, due to this, I’m upgrading its rating. It is however a borderline 7.0 for me because the duels still bother me a bit but I recently found out there is an official variant to decrease even further the luck of the duels. I want to try it.

One of 2009´s favorites.

The game is a meld of a role selection mechanic (Peurto Rico) and a worker placement mechanic (Age of Empires) with the nice addition of guns and dueling for spots.  It's also clever the way you can easily track building income by rotating the buildings.

Two plays in, and I'm liking this a lot.

Takes a number of things seen in other games (worker placement, role selection) and applies them to US Old West city building - with gunfights to spice it up and add a little unpredictability!

Played it three times now.  Each time, I took a different tack, and had at least a shot at winning.  I like a game that allows for wildly different paths to victory.  There are enough choke points for gaining VP's, though, that heavy interaction between strategies is assured (as long as you want to win). Only played with the dueling chit variant, as dueling with dice would be way too frustrating.

The random starting locations for Carson City and mountains, the three starting buildings and character abilities offer various strategies with each set-up.  Like its proven worker placement brothers, there are many routes to VPs that must be considered.  Plus, Carson City offers a way to 'duel' or challenge fellow players' worker placements which adds another level of intensity.  Nothing like 'dueling' a rival for that land parcel or the VP square.

RATING: 7
There are two key differences between this and other worker placement games. The first is that most actions can be contested. If two or more players select the same action, they have a gunfight to determine who gets to take it. The losers get their cowboys back to play on the following turn and the winner gets the action. Your firepower is the modifier on your roll, and firepower can be increased by owning certain buildings, selecting a gun-totin' personality, or winning the "ammunition" action.

The other key difference is the town-building board play. Buildings confer certain benefits, mostly providing income but sometimes increased firepower or defense. You also score points for buildings and money at game's end. Buildings earn money based on their proximity to other types of buildings and so there are some interesting choices in planning and placement.

The game actually reminded me of Stone Age quite a bit, another medium-weight worker placement game with dice. I prefer Carson City, though, because there is a greater range of options and each decision feels more significant (also, I despise the massive and largely hidden end-game scoring of Stone Age). I think they basically have the same audience. Carson City would be a reasonable step up for someone who enjoys Stone Age and is looking for something similar, but a bit more strategic.

Strategies to be followed are restricted and randomness in duels is high, but they are funny. This and a short time of play make the game enjoyable.

Purchased Essen 2009. Played once, but only on two players. First impressions were that it wasn't as good as expected and that it was quite fiddly, but I think that might be due to playing with just two players (even though we used the river side of the board to give a bit more competition) as well as being new at it, so would like to play again with more players before rating it. Preliminary rating based on first play around 6.5.

RATING: 7.2
The mechanics and theme match very well - I really like how it all works.  It's fun seeing the town expand - that's very neat - the houses arrive automatically as buildings are built.  The closest game to it is probably Age Of Empires III, which is another favourite of mine. Caylus is another obvious comparison game but it just 'felt' closer to AOE3, perhaps because of the more conscious integration of theme and mechanics. I think that this also makes the game just a little clunky in places - calculating income is a bit annoying, for example - but I'm willing to forgive that. Importantly, the game IS fast. It does not wear out its welcome and some might argue that it finishes too quickly - I will have to reserve judgement for now.  The rules are easy to understand but I think that they could have used a bit more flavour, which I added when explaining. For example, the action where you get $4 per cowboy on the space is 'obviously' where the cowboys simply go working as labourers for the turn to generate a bit of extra cash.

I rank this and World Without End as my two favorite worker placement games.

I liked:
- The ability to duel for placement spots, as opposed to just blocking other players out as in most other placement games.
- The "arc" of development and growth of Carson City as we build
- The feeling that I've only scratched the surface of various strategies; there's so much to do and so many ways to get victory points
- The theme that pervades everything - personality abilities, guns & duels, building requirements and earnings... (eating chili & cornbread while we played added to the immersive experience nicely)
- The biggest, chunkiest, best pair of wooden dice I've ever seen.

I get the same feeling as I do in Hansa Teutonica that to do well you need to be very flexible and respond to what other players are doing. You need to adjust your tactics and strategy to what you see on the board, and what will work in one game might not in another.

The game involves building properties with the intent of gaining synergies from mutually beneficial buildings.  The synergies aren't as interesting as with, say Metropolis.

I first played with two and thought the game was okay but was excited to see it blossom with more players. After enduring the 5 player experience I'm wondering if this game has a sweet-spot or if it is just not-quite-there with all numbers.

I still highly recommend this game and think that everyone should try it at least once!

As in his other game Palais Royal, Xavier Georges created a worker placement game with a twist and couples it with a spatial part. In Palais Royal it was worker majorities per action, this time the twist is the possibility to let your workers (cowboys) duel it out for the actions. Not exactly what I was waiting for. It doesn't feel right that someone can choose to play a different game and go for some dice rolling battles instead of development and even worse letting random decide who will be this guy if more than one player want to go this route. 
The spatial part of placing buildings to construct a western city is unpolished and fell flat for me as did the palace garden in Palais Royal. Xavier Georges goes on my list of not-to-watch authors.

Okay, so it is definitely in the same family as Caylus, a game I enjoy but so far stink at.  It is both a worker placement game and an area control game.  That being said, I think there are more choices here than in Caylus and the scoring is done differently and the roles add a real twist to things.  I like this game and hope to play it a bunch of times.

In theory I like the idea of a euro design involving direct, dice-based conflict.  The luck of the dice is indeed considerable, but the game definitely allows you to mediate that as you see fit.

In general, I enjoy the game, but don't see it necessarily becoming a favorite, as competition in worker placement games is getting pretty tight, and the theme doesn't make the game stand out.

While I like the artwork, the quality of the production is lacking, though mainly because it is a Chinese production and just cannot compare to German print quality.

A fairly convoluted system of buildings (affecting other buildings), some dueling and bidding on VP/money. Its not a bad game, but downtime is pretty severe (due to game design, not player AP). And it really lacks any imaginative spark or fun element.

Its a dry, dry game based on the wild west.

Wonderful stuff, the duelling mechanic is a tiny added bit of spice to an otherwise dry WP game.

Rating provisional. I went last in the first round and never got any traction. (Understatement.) I need to play this again and find out if going last can be balanced out by passing and keeping a cowboy for the second round if you're 4th or 5th.

A worker placement game with lots of player interaction and more theme than other euros. It's sometimes called Caylus with a theme, and while not entirely fair, it does resonate.

What distinguishes Carson City from most worker placement games is not theme, but that all actions are always available to all players. However, the cost of these actions may change depending what players decide to do. If you really want a particular action, or parcel of land, and another player has put their worker on it, you can put your worker there too. A gunfight will ensue and the winner claims the spot. 

Worker placement is essentially a timing driven bidding mechanic. You bid by placing your workers, which denies other players that spot. In effect, bidding earlier is how you bid higher. 

Carson City changes the importance of timing. If you want a particular action, or parcel of land, you don't need to place your worker their first. You can place after and challenge them to a duel. Placing first signals your intent, though it may act as a deterrent. So if you wait to place your cowboy on a spot you can still place it there, you just might have to pay more for, where "pay" means committing more firepower, and the risk of losing. So the cost for each place on the board is variable rather than fixed. 

This is reminiscent of the displacement action in Hansa Teutonica, or placing knights and squires in Lancaster. The way it works here is different, but the idea is the same: you can do whatever you want so long as you're willing to pay for it.

I can see playing this 50+ times.

UPDATE: I have about 10 plays in cardboard and another 20 plays on Yucata. This still holds up well, however I have come to prefer it with the river, the might-is-right variant, and using random combinations of the personalities. My preference would be to have all that and randomly choose personalities from the base game and the expansion. That would give take this to 100+ plays. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very fun to play.

But after several games, I grew annoyed that winning really required carefully timing getting the right role to amass money and make a couple large conversions of money to VP.  The fun parts -- buildings and squabbling over actions and buildings' incomes -- are so nice; the contortions to translate that into big points now seem to me an odd, unnatural break in the theme.

2017-05-26 - 5 - Mediocre worker placement with city building. I don't mind negative interaction, which takes place here, but the city building aspect is just another not engaging kind of - build this kind of building next to that kind of building and you will get some bonus and that's all. I prefer Deadwood which maybe is not awesome, but just OK.

Worker placement + city building with a twist (conflict for spaces). Good game, but the scoring is weird, apparently the winning strategy is to rush in the beginning for money and the rest of the game focus on collecting land to the end game points. The gun variant is more balanced/interesting than the regular die roll for combat.

I personally really like this game.  I love a lot about the game especially the theme behind the game itself.  Everything is very fitting, and the type of game (worker placement) is one of my favorite.  Other enjoyable factors include the way player turns are determined, game based mostly on skill over luck, and replay value due to random starting positions.

I would personally rate this game a lot higher, maybe in the 8 - 9 range if I had people as equally thrilled to play this game as myself.  I've only been lucky enough to play a few full fledged 4P games and not enough to really develop a deep connection with it.

So the lack of full points on this game comes purely on the fact that it's not drawing my friends together to play as much as some of the other games in my collection.  That is a huge part of what a game needs to be no matter how much I want to play it.  Since this isn't a solo game, I must detract points for that alone.

The other factor is the fact that the one aspect I wish was more used in the game isn't really used at all if any.  That's the cowboy taking over someone else's spot.  As with all my other games, we love cut throat games and stick it to the other person as much as possible.  The pure joy of being the reason why someone loses feels good, and I personally expected that the gun slinging would lead to a few game swings.  However, it's more or less not even visible in a normal run of the game.  Since the risk factor and payout does not balance well, most players play the game like Sim City and concentrate on just their own doings since they are in full control.  This sadden me a bit since there wasn't much sticking it to other players as I'd like.

Overall, I suggest this game for anyone who is down for worker placement games like myself.  I would give it way more plays if the group of friends I have wouldn't mind the time investment over the other choices of games I own.

Lots of fun.  Strategy options abound.  The dice may be a little too random for this kind of worker placement game, but there's no doubt that they make it fun.  Haven't played with tile variant yet. Great intro to worker placement; though may be a little 'mathy' for some.

Outstanding game and I've never even been fond of the Western Theme.  I am, however, a fan of city building and despite there being a ton more city building focused games out there I still find this one fascinating in how to choose particular parcels and connect things with roads.  Combined with worker placement and role selection it all works really well together.  It comes across very thematic as well.  Their is a variant to help take the randomness of the duels out of the game but I am one who sides with the designer on this issue and prefer the thematic nature of the dial rolls.  A lot of variety and replayability in the base game alone.

This is a very slick worker-placement game with, obviously, a wild-west theme.  The coolest thing that it brings to the "genre" is its conflict mechanics.  Unfortunately, the ability to duel people for actions may make it lean a little in the direction of making guns overpowered.  Still, it's fun and solid, and is a nice alternative to most other games of this type.

This is a highly tactical game.  you must react to what your opponents are doing, or better yet force them to react to you.  Best with 3 if you don't like confrontation, best with 4 if you do.  just the base game has enough options to get this to the table 20-30 times and not have the same game twice.  The dice rolls put off some people, but if that is the case the gun tiles are a decent substitute.

Average worker placement game with duels to allow different players to claim the same tile. I don't like the duelling with dice, too random and the result can be too significant (especially in the last round). Might try the variant with the duel cards, but would  have expected this to be part of the basic game.

Carson City is definitely just another worker placement game, but it is way more interactive than average games in the genre (which a big plus) + it has an interesting city building aspect.

In the future I'd like to see the designer expanding the city building aspects of the game and cut the worker placement altogether - now that would be a killer game.

Only played this earlier this year, and it's a very solid and unique worker placement game. It feels pretty rough and unpolished in some areas, and if you play it with the dice or the random tiles, this is a solid 3 or 4. With fixed tiles for each player, it flies up to a 7.5.

06-30-2014 - Played a learning game last night and it went pretty well!  Now that we've done it I think I see what's important and when.  Right now I'll give this a 7.5 because I liked it, but it was a little ... I don't know.  I want to say "random", and that's true for the most part, but you can do things to mitigate the consequences of randomness not going your way.  There are a lot of things you can do to help yourself it seems that we just didn't know to do last night.  Another issue though that can't really be helped is the fiddliness.  So many things to keep track of on the board when something changes (buildings need to be dropped an income tier or raised, easy to forget and miss things, no way to easily tell if something is off except by scrutinizing much of the board).  So anyway, 7.5 for now, but it may go up.

session report by me
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/4137935

Update after playing gunslinger and way out west.

Downgraded it from 8 to 7.5
actually I have a feeling that this might be the weakest of the three. 
Gunslinger I liked but there are not so many options really compared to the others. It's all about shooting
Way out west Should be played with at least four players. 
Early negative rolls can have a devestating effect on your income and put someone in a strong position

Carson city played well with three. It has the least connection to the theme than the other two. But there was some room to get back in the game.

Now scoring on execution of gunfight

Gunslinger 9
Way out west 7
Carson city 4.

Way out west and carson city have an economic aspect to it as well. While in Way out west there is no option but to fight yourself back in the game. There are some actions (or characters that will provide you with the income.
While looking at the theme there is no need to recover.

In gunbslinger I got a bad aim since I was shot in my gun hand  so I lost (there were some cards that could have allowed me to win) but it would have been  a lucky shot.

In way out west it is possible that when  you get beaten in a fight even though you are the favourite you will loose a part of your income. It's very hard to make up for it if it happens early on.  But I'm okay with that it feels real.

In carson city character selection and action selection will provide you with income to stay competetive . Losing a fight doesn't have such a huge impact for that reason. But to me that is a flaw in a game depicting the wild west.
Nonetheless I think of carson city as my settlers. This game I can easily explain to non-gamers and  have a good time playing it.

RATING: 6
Initial one-game-played -rating. Wow, this has a lot of different mechanics crammed together. Maybe too much, this needs more plays to find out. The tile-laying spatial aspect combined with worker placement works great, not too sure about the role selection though. It seems that the dominant strategies are either firepower supremacy or avoiding gunfights +using the trader to double income (to my surprise I won the game with the latter along with going first for cash to points -conversion).

Update: Some of the roles are obvious choices while others are useless most of the time, so not much game there. Still, despite its shortcomings (mainly that one or two key dice rolls can in a worst case make or break your game, which feels out of place in worker placement, pun intended) it's somewhat interesting, and doesn't take too long even with more players. Being hosed by dice in a 2 hour game would be too much.

Want to try the New Beginning variant.

Played once, 4 players.  Certainly not bad, but not that great either.  There's too much uncertainty from round to round for a plan to hold together.  I do see the similarity to Caylus (which I'm not a huge fan of), and I would rather play Carson City.  Carson City is faster and funner, but, ultimately, less polished.  This game does have quite a bit of style, though, and a more interesting theme.

Intense & rather rich game with tons of options and things to consider.  Lots of player interaction and cut throat tactics.  A fair potential for bash the leader and 'take that' tactics.

RATING: 4
It's a worker placement game, and like all worker placement game, either the make little sense with the them, either they scale badly with the number of players.

What is unique in carson city is that competition for the same space is resolve in a duel which consist in a die roll + the number of guns you have. That is an interesting mechanic and method to add randomness to a worker placement game.

It's a fair mechanic untill somebody has 7 guns making it easier to get the level 3 gun and ending up with 10 guns + characters and killing everything in sight.

Else the game is averagly complex and not color blind friendly because each swuare not only contains a building but also the color of the player who owns the terrain. So the board eventually get pretty messed up.

RATING: 6
This worker placement game with conflict when more than one person chooses an action on a Caylus type action track really has kept me thinking about different strategies - probably a good sign.  I would enjoy more opportunities to explore this game, but still would prefer to play Agricola and other worker placement games over this one at this point.  Still, I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this one much more than expected - and it plays at a fairly quick place.  The role selection aspect also adds an interesting and dynamic aspect to the game - particularly the sheriff!

Great game, nice theme, clear rules and cowboy meeples !

The only downside are the dice especially at the end of the game. There are so few rolls that dice rolling can't be justified as such an imprtant factor. The alternative rules with the tiles aren't really that much better as well. It can be a game breaker and that's sad because otherwise it's an awesome game.

Carson City is a very nice worker placement game with some tile laying. The duel mechanics makes this worker placement game unique as it let you bump other people workers.

RATING: 9
Very good game. Sleeper hit from 2009-2010. Gameplay is surprisingly deep even though luck plays a big role in the game. But luk can be mitigated if you focus on acquiring "guns". 4 turns is really quick to play and you need to be real careful not to loose the "pace" of the game. One turn where an opponent buys a lot of point can really end the game.

There is also PLENTY of replayability in the game: 2 boards, 3 variants (and a simili-luckless combat variant), role cars with 2 sides... It is really amazing how much is packed in this game.

Also: the theme is incredibly well rendered. The best cowboy game I played since Doomtown CCG.

RATING: 6
Caylus? No. Worker Placement and the actions executed in order "like Caylus", yes.

There's the main area where you build, gain multipliers for your income and or points, as well as potentially screw your opponents income.

Then there's the matter of the characters that determine turn order for the round with variable powers; tack onto that that they are chosen in ascending passing order from the previous round.

It's all tense, diverse, and quite fun.

I will say however that the dice can be a little unforgiving, though this can be mitigated and perhaps avoided altogether with the variant. I also do not think this game is as good with 5.

I like everything about this game, except the duel resolution.  In the three duels I was in in my one play I was 2+ up on my opponent, and lost every one of them.

Single game, played with the bandit expansion.

A euro game with some randomness (the worst kind though - dice) which managed to keep the theme pretty well but still seemed rather dull to me.

You won't hear me lament if I never play this again, but I could be talked into it if nothing else was available I guess.

Breve pero intenso. Este podria ser el resumen de un "Euro-Trash" (si haces uso de los dados en vez de las losetas), en el que en apenas 4-5 turnos se determina quien es el pistolero más rapido del tablero. En cada uno de ellos tomarás el rol de un personaje, con el fin de conseguir dinero, terrenos, pistolas o puntos de victoria. 

Subasta de asentamientos estilo Caylus (con la diferencia de que los que entran en puja salen nuevos cada ronda y en el que ser el primero en posicionarte no te garantiza hacerte con ese asentamiento) para colocarlos dentro de una ciudad del viejo Oeste. Si 2 o más jugadores coinciden en un mismo territorio, los balazos están asegurados

I really like the theme.  I really like the worker placement track at the top of the board.  And I really like the interaction between players.

I just have a hard time really liking the bottom two thirds of the board and the fiddly tiles you have to lay down.  The mechanics are sometimes confusing and hard to remember.  It gets a little frustrating when you're trying to make a move and the thing you've been working for the last ten minutes isn't allowed because your too close to a mountain or someone else's claim.  Fiddly.

That being said, I enjoy the game enough to play it when it comes to the table.

The whole 'fighting for spots' doesn't really make the worker placement more interesting, it just takes away some of the tension of what spots to go for first and creates this thing of 'i hope the one with guns has better things to do'. Plus the whole money exchange for VP thing is kinda boring.

This is one of the most brain burning games I own, and a pretty unique game to boot. It takes a long time to teach, but it's not actually complicated -- it's just so heavy on options and paths to victory that every turn requires a lot of thought.

There's a fair amount of downtime as you wait for people to make decisions, but it doesn't feel like downtime because you need every second to formulate your own plans. There wasn't much chit-chat during our first play for this same reason -- playing Carson City is an intense, head-down experience.

I found myself exclaiming aloud that it was a fascinating game during our first play. It expresses its themes well (I actually felt like we were founding a city in the Wild West, rough-and-tumble jockeying for position and all), and as a conflict-heavy Euro it occupies a unique spot in my collection.

It could rise to an 8 or 9 after a couple more plays; it's a 7 because one play just isn't enough to really give a full assessment. Unfortunately, one player said he didn't want to play it again (for many of the reasons I enjoyed it), and I suspect another regular player in our group would hate it...so it's not likely to see much action. Bummer!

Neat...but three years later its first play was its only play. There are other games I'd rather play. Sold it.

It's hard to say how I feel about this game after 1 play. It's heavy. The concept and flow of play are simple enough--perhaps even light. However, the details about building and scoring make this game complex. The instructions are well laid out, and the game board makes good use of iconography, but it still felt a little cloudy during the first play. I think it's similar to Caylus in many ways. The building aspect is similar, the resolution of actions is similar and the weight is on par. I definitely like it. It's more thematic, less dry and more random than Caylus, but it's also less pure. I think it has the makings of a great game, and can see it having legs, for sure.

I owned this for about a year, but it never made it to the table.  After reading through the rules, I honestly just wasn't very excited to play.  The mechanics with the buildings and payouts seems a bit fiddly/cumbersome, and the worker placement and role selection aspects seem so straight forward that it just doesn't seem interesting.  It's not fair of me to give the game a rating, but I just don't think it's a game that I'd enjoy.  (I acquired it in a math trade....never would've bought it).

Update: tried again, still the same, downgraded. I don't need to play this again, your valuable gaming time can be spent so much better.

Some fun this game, but nothing new here. It's worker placement on a set path like Caylus. The duels are very important and include a considerable random element. I prefer Caylus, which is more strategic, no dice, but I am no fan of this type of worker placement games in general.

A meaty worker placement game with many paths to victory.  For me the direct play interaction of dueling makes this a much more attractive worker placement game.  Crap, I was going to go there! O.k., let's duel!  Since I lost virtually every duel I fought my first game and still managed to come in second it doesn't appear that losing a duel is a that big of a deal.  I may like this even more after more plays and I understand the strategies better but I fear my euro playing friends just aren't going to like the "in your face" aspect of dueling.

RATING: 6
This rating is somewhat tentative.  I've had my eye on Carson City for a while but only recently picked it up.  I've now played twice, and have a couple of concerns.  

Firstly, it seems difficult to avoid one player focusing on guns to the point where on his turn he can do whatever he wants.  This seems to greatly limit the degree to which other players strategies can be executed and more importantly puts the gun-focused player in the position of kingmaker/spoiler if he won't get quite enough points to win.

Secondly, I don't really like that there is a trade-off between building the city and scoring victory points.  The game feels as though you are trying to build the 'best city,' but in reality that seems to mean you've waited too long to start scoring points.

I would still like to play it again, as I certainly don't feel I've explored the game's possibilities to any great extent.

Very fun spin on the worker placement genre. I like the fact that you can place workers on either actions or territory to purchase. I LOVE the fact that you can actually fight over the spots too!

Sorta a cross between Way Out West and Caylus.  It's a worker placement game where after the worker placement phase actions are resolved in order determined by their position on the board.  What makes this game interesting is that players are also buying and placing tiles to build towns.  There are some interesting placement and timing decisions to consider that can effect your opponents.  Furthermore there are shootouts that determine who wins a tile (if multiple workers are placed on an action) and you can try to steal profits from buildings.  I think I would always prefer the dice for shootouts over the less exciting card-draw variant.

after the first couple of plays, feels like it was intended for five (or at least four).  would like to try out the "chit" variant for resolving duels.  

i think this game gets unfairly compared to caylus.  yes, there is a 'resolving down the road" aspect, but it is unlike caylus in most other areas.

really enjoy this game.  it takes a while to start to figure out the different strategies to employ.  Most people don't take advantage of attacking other players and some of the choices, but as you start to get the game you will like it more and more.

CC can be a little daunting for some to learn as it does feel a tad overwhelming with all the rules.  I recommend not overloading new players when learning this game.

Who doesn't love building Carson City in the late 1800s? Buy the right buildings at the best prices and then place them most effectively. Beware gunfighters!

Yet another worker placement euro that presents players with solveable scenarios and demands engine-building/snowball planning like most games of this ilk. Why anyone finds this fun is truly beyond me - it's Excel spreadsheety in the worst way, and to mitigate this it pretends to add a "novel" mechanic of dueling, which offers players a chance to "compete" and roll off for control of a space. But in the end, even in spite of the dice roll, the stronger player (the one who has collected more guns) typically wins. So the game rewards the same snowball planning while simultaneously it punishes risk-taking. This robs the game of any meaningful conflict or tension and what we are left with is an abstract, pasted-on Western theme version of Caylus-light that must make the fanboys in their fatboy underpants squee with delight. No thank you.

Despite playing very differently, Carson City reminded me of Power $truggle. Both adopt an established, popular Euro game mechanism as their core (worker placement and area majority, respectively) and then layer subsystem upon subsystem on top in an effort to build a highly thematic experience: duels, town expansion, and roles in Carson City versus bribes, secret goals, and divisional powers in Power $truggle. The result in both cases is a game that takes forever to explain, seems far more complicated than it really is, but is ultimately fairly straightforward to play. Both are very "thematic" for Euro games, but fans of "Ameritrash" would probably find them quite dry. While I've enjoyed my first play of each, I'm not entirely sure how much of an actual game exists beneath all the moving parts. Definitely interested in trying again.

Caylus with gun fights!  A good game and I like the ability to attack other players and build out a town.

This game caught me off gaurd, because I was expecting it to rate as a high 8 to a low 9.  I really wasn't expecting a cowboy western themed game to rate as a 10 for me (thought that only a Fantasy or Scifi theme such as War of the Ring or Galactic Emperor could do that),  but it did.

It was fun to play, I just don't know if I want to play this one again. It's probably too long for what it is, but that's because I don't really like worker placement games. The tile placement can be very interesting, but that railroad makes scoring powerful near the end

This was a great first impression.  Only played it as 2 player but really enjoyed the different things going on.  Would love to play 4 or 5 players.  I did feel bad that the game came down to a shootout for the 5$ a point action and I just won because of random dice rolling.

This is the ultimate cowboy, gunslinging, wild west game. I really enjoy trying to get the most meaningful actions in buying up buildings and staking claim in Carson City. You never feel safe with the looming threat of a duel. A great strategy game that keeps you on your toes.

Caylus city with duels and a bit of random.

Sold it. Didn't do it for me. A decent worker placement game but for me it doesn't offer much variance for 2-players only games(which is the usual player count for me). I also don't like the bookkeeping element in it, having to check and re-check buildings' revenue every time me, or my opponent, add a building is boring me.
A solid game however.

RATING: 6.5
A worker placement game with guns. It seems this would be interesting and interactive, but it creates a lot of frustration for loser of the duel. Also, it might be difficult to count how much income you can have for a specific building type. However, it does provide multiple paths of victories, and the added tension does make the game a bit deeper than the typical worker placement game which you can enforce the action you have selected without risk. Will definitely try again.

I bought Carson City almost a year ago but it never made it to our table. It seemed to be "just another" worker placement game and I decided to trade it. Just by chance it landed on our gaming table... I was amazed to see that Carson City makes a truly original worker placement game with a very nice twist. There's much more to it than just placing your cowboy meeples on their chosen action and then to wait for the result. I love the old West theme, I love the interaction between players (not to mention the gun fights). Carson City will never leave my collection, that's for sure! Wonderful game wich I enjoyed quite a bit (**but not as good as El Grande though** ;)).

In this Western worker placement game, your workers can be challenged to a duel for a right to use the action. Duels consist of a dice roll, modified by guns you have and extra workers. 

Each turn, you choose a role that will give you some benefits for the turn, such as extra income or extra firepower. The game lasts 4 turns, where you construct buildings on a map to earn income or VPs. 

This game has a lot of theme. But, you could be picked on, and it is not a nice feeling to lose a bunch of duels or be picked on by the big bully on campus. This game came out in 2009, and I missed it with my gaming group, but I had a chance to play it on yucata.de. It's fun to play for theme, not so much in terms of a strategic game, but perhaps I haven't played enough to be able to defend against attacks.

2-5 players, worker-placement game

The wild west theme suits this game very well. A Caylus worker-placement type of game, but with several twists: 

a) workers can fight over the worker placement spots
b) you are building a city on a square grid map
c) every turn, you choose a role (sheriff, banker, grocer, etc.), which gives certain benefits

I've played this one quite a bit.
I like cowboys, and the game feels like the oldwest thanks to all the components (taverns, cowboy meeples, Character cards, etc.).  All the pieces are a bit fiddly, but that's a small draw back.
The box/insert however suck.

I really liked it. I guess very similar to Caylus in terms of how the actions resolve, but definitely shorter and lighter than Caylus. Really want to play it again now, to see how it plays when you're more familiar with the importance of guns, and of buying VPs asap!

RATING: 6
Definitely a new twist on the worker placement game. It may be too complicated, though. I usually like these kind of games where there are a lot of inter-connected parts, but here it's almost impossible to plan your turn as others can fight you for your spots. So, if you get beat early on in a duel, the rest of your turn can be rendered meaningless and the game's not long enough to recover from that. It's another game that I would gladly play again with a group that really likes it, but don't see the need for us to own it.

NOT a strategy game. There are some elements of strategy but they are carefully destroyed by a roll of dice. Indeed, ultimately your decisions will be challenged by a duel with another player and the outcome of the duel will be decided by a dice. True, by carefully planning your moves, you might get some guns which help in a fight. But those moves are likely to be challenged by a duel, and again a roll of dice. The importance of the dice can probably be played down by using a four sided dice, or a longer game (oh god no!) or simply by limiting the game to three players. As it is, at five players every single one of your actions will be challenged by a duel and a dice roll. in a four round game, you get one round of bad luck and your game is fucked. A good thing is that a lost duel is not a lost action, because your cowboy (understand workman) will be given back to you, and you can play it again on the next round. If you lose a lot of duels, you have more actions to play the next round. But that means a duel is a very common place, and ultimately the game turns around provocating duels and therefore rolling dice... and strategy makes place to luck.

RATING: 4
The features that separate Carson City from other Worker Placement games happen to be mechanics that are among my least favorite; dice rolling for success/failure outcome, and area control. The impact these mechanics have on gameplay creates a feeling of impermanence to one's actions and purchases. Nothing is safe! Place a worker and he can be removed by a duel. Build a building and its value can be eroded by other player's purchases. This lawlessness might be thematic, but is probably also part of my general dislike of the Old West.

CC is a victory point salad, except you have to commit workers to trigger VP payout, so on top of the concerns listed above, one must also judiciously use their finite workers in this way or much one's work has little value at game end.

Aside from a personal dislike of the game's era, I think CC could be forbidding for new players as some kind of comprehensible strategy may take several games to manifest, which is a dealbreaker for me.

RATING: 8
This game was interesting.  A bit of role selection, battles, worker placement, and tile laying.  I enjoyed this game, winning the first time I played helps, but the way the tile placement gave you money, role selection and worker placement gave you avenues to victory, the way all of these aspects worked together seamlessly was a feat in itself.

RATING: 7
Plays like a variant of Caylus, except for the scoring differences. It's solid; I would play again, but doesn't (yet) feel special. On a first play, the strategy of buying victory points with money and neglecting engine seemed to work too well, and it felt wrong for being so, but this is surely something that would be less of a factor in subsequent plays. I'm also not a fan of the mechanic where conflicts are decided by dice, although there is no better way to do it.

A nice twist on a worker-placement game. If you go in expecting Caylus-lite you will be sorely disappointed; managing dueling is a key part of this game. At the same time the frisson of randomness reduces the need to make a foolproof plan, which helps reduce AP.

There are some compensations for losing a duel, which makes it not too much of a blow. I enjoy a little bit of chaos too.

At 4 rounds it plays very quickly. I also enjoy the spatial aspect of the town.

The "Kit Carson" variant sounds awesome.

Rules are not complex and the game is dynamic. But the 4 rounds take longer than you initially expect (there are a lot of things to consider and to do!).

Worker placement at heart, but adds role selection, tile laying and interaction (demanded by the theme). The interaction is very important, duels can have deep effects, for good or for bad. They can be played with tiles or dice. I prefer tiles, they add a memory mechanism to the game but are much more strategic and tactic.

The theme implementation is fantastic. It feels a bit like the wild west (and that's a lot to say about an euro, lol).

Art is fine (maybe a bit uninspired) and component quality is good (cowboy meeples! yay! Heavy cardstock!)

It's has a bit more depth than it initially seems, but still it is a game that will please many players.

Carino, ricorda un po' Caylus, un po' meno german ma con più variabili. Gioco di programmazione ambientato nel west. Ogni giocatore cerca di sviluppare la propria rete di rendite e punti vittoria. Carina la parte dei duelli che rappresenta una particolarità del gioco non imprescindibile ma comunque simpatica. Gioco da provare che offre una buona longevità per via degli scenari variabili.

wow... so i went to a gammenight.. and Brian said "you wanna help me learn carson city?" and i said "sure"
a random guy joined us (we got lucky because it could have been lame with only 2)

so after about an hour of starting to play, Brian was about to give up... the rules are tough to learn... (they're not bad once you know them)
we stuck with it, and made some mistakes along the way, but by the end i was sold...

Perhaps this is not a true strategy game, since there are a lot of dice rolls, but the dice rolls are sooo different than your typical dice rolls... these roll's decide winners/losers of duels... but they DON'T decide winners and losers of the game...

it is done SOOO welll, when you win a duel, you use that dude to buy something... when your lose a duel, that dude returns to your possey to help to kick ass in other duels still to be fought... and he THEN can STILL be used to claim something the next turn... (plus the later duels are usually the ones you want to win anyway)

so you only use dudes to buy stuff you want.. and if you lose... you have a better chance the rest of that turn, and you have an extra move next turn...

it's almost like the majority of duels in this game don't really affect the winner of the game, they just change the way each involed player needs to play for the remaining of the game.

another awesome thing about duels, is that ties are broken by the order in which players "passed" first... you might not see how that is cool if you haven't played... but it really is soooo awesome... it's a "push your luck" scenario each round... and if someone runs to safety before you, they've got a really good chance of warding off an attack you send their way.  

I want to play again... it should be a snap to teach now that we know how to play...

currently HIGHLY RECOMENDED, as a strategy game, with real time randomness... that doesn't steal the spotlight

[2010/01/30]

quick disclaimer.. i played last night, and i think this game is making me delusional...

I still love playing this game, and i'd like to keep playing...  this time we played with 5 and that made it even more awesome than 3... 

heres where the delusion kicks in: i like this game so much i think i've convinced myself that this is a "Light game"... Make no mistake... this is a "Heavy game" with a natural feeling of randomness.. There is a crapload of math (that i don't mind at all).. but you should be aware of it before you play it or spring it on your friends


P.S. This is a deceptive statement I made about this game "It's only 4 turns, how long can it be"

I really enjoy the excitement and tension of this game.  It feels like a showdown.  The primary mechanic is worker placement, but players can compete for the various actions/properties by dueling with dice and guns.

First play tells me that its the kind of game I'll like. Comparisons with Caylus are obvious on the surface, but the gameplay itself is quite different. A knowledge of the buildings, and what they pay would be a great help - some kind of crib sheet perhaps.

4 rounds only and whilst feeling insufficient, it is actually just about right - though mistakes can be costly in such a short game. Enjoyable.

Falls into that middle ground where it's got elements that don't appeal to Eurogamers (eg the inevitable overt conflict) and those that don't appeal to Ameritrashers (eg optimisation of acquisition of VP's). The conflict is one strategic element to take into account - the investment in guns takes turns now (where you get nothing) in order to ensure you get what you want later. Those who don't invest in guns get their stuff now, but may lose expected actions later. Which way to go? For the peaceful minded, note who the next round's gunslingers are likely to be and make plans to do other things. One of the strengths is that there are many paths to follow so there are always options, but being prepared for multi-player luck to bear a fair proportion of the result will get you in the right mind-set to enjoy. And be psychologically prepared for the occasional really bad roll of the dice to kill your turn and lose you those last essential VPs that would have given you the game. With so few turns in the game to recover, a bad roll can dramatically affect your result. Everyone's got a sob story ... which is why I'm a bit equivocal on the game. I'd prefer a game to finish with emotional highs all round from a well fought game rather than downers on targeting, dice, etc.

RATING: 5
What I like:
- The spatial aspect makes it more interesting than many worker placement games
- Just 4 rounds, so it feels quick (our 2p learning game took 100 minutes, but felt shorter)
- The theme works well and fits the mechanics

What I don't like:
- There is quite a bit of conflict; I'm not sure if you could win playing defensively
- Each round requires a bit more planning than I would like, and the end-of-round money limit is probably the part that puts it over the line

I didn't expect to like CC, so it probably exceeded my expectations. It's clearly a very well-designed game, but hits a bit higher than I like both on weight (I'll say 3.0) and on conflict. Just not my thing.

Place your workers in order to perform actions, however, two people can place them in the same area and will have to duel for the privilege. Using the men you have not placed and the guns you own, you sum that with the roll of one die to determine who wins and stays on the tile. The city is also shared by all, so others can block you or steal points. A must try in my opinion.

RATING: 5
Each round is in two phases: placing workers and resolving workers and these two phases are separate. Placing the workers, where all the thinking/planning is done takes up a small proportion of the game compared to the "resolve workers" phase.  The resolve phase is burdened with a lot of fiddly bookkeeping.  It's occasionally livened up by the occasional duel, but duels are not that frequent once players realize they are not really all that beneficial, except, of course, in the final round.  As a result, I feel the game really drags. Another weakness is that whoever has the sheriff in the final round has an advantage that is very tough to overcome. The banker, perhaps, has the best shot at overcoming this advantage.   If I want a game where player's "shoot" each other, I will play something else.

Ovvero, un Caylus nel selvaggio West! Bel gioco di Xavier Georges, che punta sulla meccanica dell'ordine di gioco "a serpentone" del suo illustre predecessore e su una veste grafica molto sopra la media.

L'interazione è altissima e distruttiva, edifici e personaggi sono vari e ben caratterizzati, la durata è contenuta per un gioco con uno spessore non sottile.

Da metà partita in poi, l'affollamento rende più difficile fare strategie e fare i conti, ma è un gioco più che soddisfacente.

I've only ever played this game with 2.  I really like it, and the games have always been close.  But - we feel like we are missing part of the game.  There are seven roles on offer, and each game we'll only select three or four.  Also, apart form the first game, we've never had a duel.  It's just that with two players, the game options aren't cramped enough for these things to be needed - there's always something else to do which makes better sense.

Everyone describes this game as "Caylus with guns"; I found the Caylus part to be enjoyable, but the guns, not so much.  Basically, anyone can challenge one of your actions, forcing both players to either simultaneously choose and flip a tile to see who wins in one variant, or roll dice in another.  Neither or these really appealed to me, and while it didn't happen too often, the possibility of it sapped a little of the fun out of the game.  The game did have an interesting spatial component, where players claimed spaces on a grid and built buildings there to generate income.  Overall though, this game felt too confrontational to me.

RATING: 2
Wow, this was surprisingly awful.  The game is very confrontational & you can come in dead last just because of a very, very small number (~3) of bad die rolls.  Nothing you really do matters when this happens.  I got rolled out of my lone game early (3 1's in a row) & it was tedium at best the rest of the way.  Even without the dice issue, I didn't find the "role selection", tile placement, or really anything very interesting.  Even one low roll can cost you the game.  So many better games to play...

Probably my favorite worker placement game.  I like how it has the role selection, limited rounds, tile laying/city building, and confrontation with its worker placement.  The confrontation aspect is special as if someone takes a spot you want, you can gunfight for them.  The loser will get a bonus for the next round, so not totally hosed over.

This game ends far too quickly, though, when everyone is wanting to get going with their engine.

What a nice, tight game... everything a worker placement style game should be. You always feel like you're just a couple actions shy of everything you'd like to do. I like the theme too.

Awesome game. I really like worker-placement and this game adds so much to the mechanism. Yes, it's brutal and dice rolls can make a big difference.  But this fits the theme and losing a duel isn't the end of the world as you get the worker back for the next turn. 
There's a LOT of depth in placing your workers and managing your money. I prefer the Big Box for the components, but the original game is balanced very well. 
Lots of interaction, lots of choices. I don't easily give a 10 but this game deserves it

I can see why this is a good worker placement game in the year 2009. I finally got to play this game 7 years later in 2016 and it was still a beast to go through. It's pretty heavy so it took a turn to realize what I was doing. And that is 1/4 of the game. I didn't place last but second to last in a 4 player game but missing that first turn doing anything productive hurt my whole engine. Definitely takes a few more plays to even out the playing field a little bit.

Judging by today's standard what is unique about it is the different number of workers and different roles offer different powers in a worker placement game. There is a luck of the draw in terms of buildings but it forces you to change your strategy as the game progresses.

The game is elegant, there are many paths to victory and the different characters in the game combined with the variants keep the game fresh and which results in excellent replay value.  

The board is very well designed and Wild West themed, the actions that a player can take proceed in a certain order every time, and the dice are HUGE in the second release of the game.  Very unique.


This is also great family and party game @ 2-5 players!

Preliminary game so far.  Great theme.  Interesting mechanisms.  Still learning how to use the various strategies.  Fabulous components.

Tried a 2 player game and that worked well too.  I used the river variant and loved to see how the city developed.

After playing a few more games I wonder about a runaway leader issue amongst inexperienced players.  The sheriff on the last victory point for dollar area in the final turn is hard to beat...

Originally a 9 but maybe down to 8 for its mathiness...

***

I've been trying to play this solo on my own playing 2 sides but this game creates quite a headache because there are so many variables...  Some games are more conducive for solitary play and some are less. This one is a challenge, especially as the games progresses and there are more options and cowboys....

Maybe rating drop to 7 because of the challenging solo play...

A more thematic and fun version of Caylus where direct confrontations are possible !! Amazing !!

This is my dream come true. It's a euro game sure, but with a theme and nice artwork.

Cowboys ? nice !! Duels ? nice !! Complex and tactical ? Amazing !!

The game also improves after each games played as there's so many things that you could do to try to take the victory. It rewards experience and knowledge which is something that I love in games.

Tends towards the medium/heavy weight side, which is great and what makes this game so unique in the gendre !!

This is a masterpiece !!

I like the way the city grows in this game, with buying parcels, building roads, adding buildings and adding new houses for the population that is attracted by the new buildings. The duels by themselves I don't mind, but it felt like the outcome of the duels leads to an all-or-nothing result for the score, which I don't like. Also, I wonder if the characters are balanced.

(Original impression was rather negative (rating: 4), but it has already improved, seeing some evidence that dueling strength isn't everything)

RATING: 5
After the worker placement mechanic comes the variant 'worker displacement' in which contested hot spots are resolved with die rolls. Being the wild west setting, thematically it fits well, however emotionally I think it's a step back from the original mechanic.

Firstly, seeing the 'hot spots' isn't easy with the overwhelming choice of placements and fiddly rules of building conditions and their relevant powers. For me it delays the tension associated with a space, but a bigger problem is the fact that the majority of spaces aren't for sole possession dilutes the feeling of the tug of of too many things to do but not enough actions.

A great western themed game with tile and worker placement! Duels can make or break you and can be pretty frustrating, but thematically, it works. I love the role/action selection as well. Of course I HAD to get the Gold & Guns expansion, which made a great game even better.

Edit: I would love a Quined Masterprint edition of this.

RATING: 6
This is a curious western themed worker placement game. The game features a method of action blocking where you can place your meeple in a spot someone else has claimed to have a duel with them right before resolution for the right to execute that spot. You can also place your meeples on other player's buildings to take half of that buildings production until they duel you off. The duel consists of adding up unspent guys plus gun tokens and then rolling a D6. This can feel a little random at times, but it's mitigatable randomness by focusing on getting more gun tokens. The loser of a duel gets the worker back to place again in the next round, whereas normally spent workers are lost. The worker being returned to the player, also means they get 1 extra firepower if they have another duel that round.

I like a lot about this game. I love how the city expands. I like that when you build most buildings you need to place a red house token somewhere legal for it to be, which both serves to fill up the map awkwardly, but also gives players big scoring opportunities when they place buildings that want to be adjacent to houses. I like the mitigatable action blocking, although the D6 thing is a little troublesome. I also like how players can sort of hinder the leader by blocking their scoring action or by taking some of their money for themselves. Here are my problems with the game...

With 3 players the game is too loose. The board grows too slowly and the action spaces feel empty. With 6 players the game is far far too tight, with few to no actions you can take other than start a duel if you aren't going very early in turn order. The Train station building from the expansion seems to be worth way too many points.  I'm not sure why the job that gives you the unduelable worker goes first (or second if playing with the 0 guy) in turn order. This seems like a doubly strong ability, as you can't place the unduelable worker in a space to start a duel. The iconography on the building tiles is pretty poor. The buildings require you to read a passage in the rulebook every time a new type of one flips, and they can be hard to remember in the face of remembering all the other rules. In the second expansion they use one of the same icons from the base game to have a different meaning, which is really troublesome.

The biggest problem with the game is the endgame scoring. Throughout the game there are action spots available that let you covert dollars into points at different ratios. In each of the 4 rounds, the next best conversion spot disappears.  Based on the character ability tile you select, you have a different ability to hold money between rounds. Any money you can't hold and didn't spend gets turned into points at a 10:1 rate, as opposed to 2/3/4/5:1 rate. All of these conversion spots are duel-able, which means taking the spot doesn't mean that you'll necessarily get to resolve it. The only sure way to convert dollars to points is at the end of the game, you discard down to your dollars held limit at that 10:1 rate, and then you can convert the remaining money at 6:1, which isn't bad, but it is bad when you look at how different the money held skills are. Several guys in the base setup only can hold $20, whereas one can hold over $100. For me, this makes scoring a frustrating experience.

What a great new Gem. It's compared to Caylus because of the road mechanic for actions/buildings but that is the only similarity. Original game. Drips with theme, you feel like you're in the wild west gunslinging in the wild west. Has a nasty factor where you can really screw someone over and mess up their plans and possibly their whole game. Everything about the buildings, guns, cowboys really fits the theme but also is logical and makes sense! Need to plan well ahead or else you can't build on previous actions. Has neat character powers that have an effect on game and plans. Can be played in under and hour with the right group! Multiple paths to victory. This is the first game this year that has the potential to break into my tens! What is there not to like?

A complex tile-laying, puzzle/efficiency game. The artworka and theme is amazing and what makes the game truly shine, I just wish that there would be a few more thematic things, like events or citizens with specific behaviours that influence the game etc. Still, there are dice and gunfights. It will take a few plays to get your head around the strategy, but that is the case with most games. Solid stuff.

I really enjoying chaining together actions and trying to take advantage of opportunities others are missing. Duels are an interesting mechanic here and while you need to be prepared for them, you can also try to avoid them by playing more cautiously, which makes for interesting "I dare you to try that," moments in the game.

Also have Carson City: Gold & Guns expansion.

2013-12-07: I always remember whether or not I played a game. Not this time. All my comments still apply, even the snide comment about stacking cowboy meeples.

2011-04-28: Yet another worker placement game.

Bonus: the cowboy meeples are fun to stack!

To be fair, here's what makes Carson City different from other worker placement games:

* No ubiquitous cubes serving as resources. Instead, they are replaced with land plots, buildings, money, and guns. all of which serve a unique purpose in the game. There's no "give me two blues, a red, and a yellow" in this game.

* The ability to invest in another resource -- guns -- to steal a chosen role away from someone else.

Still, it's a worker placement game, one of my least favourite of gaming genres, and Carson City is no exception when it comes to the genre's shortcomings:

* Poor complexity of rules to depth ratio. Because of the nature of worker placement games, in which every role must be unique, rules tend to be very long and must be understood by the players in their entirety. Carson City has actually two worker placement stages, which adds to the complexity of the rules. Still, I don't find the game particularly strategically deep, but I do think it's quite tactical (see the next point)

* I find most Euros much more tactical than strategic, and worker placement games are no exception. Players mention that "good Euros" have multiple paths of winning. However, there are usually a limited number of paths, and there is usually no way to "branch" off these paths to pursue more creative ways of winning.

Caylus with a bit less of the fun police hovering over you. When you win, this game is awesome - means you won most of the important duels. But you feel ripped when you lose your final round duels (last game I rolled 1,1,2,1). But it is fast enough not to be too bothered. Haven't played with five players yet, it would be a fairly tough affair I imagine - a lot more dueling with more importance on gun tokens and less income.

Great worker placement game with an Old West theme and gunfights. Exactly what I wanted from Way Out West. Pick a role (sheriff, settler, banker, etc) then take turns chosing actions (hire guns, build buildings, stake new property, etc). The cool part is that you can fight over the actions. Fast game--90 minutes or so--with minimal down time.

Component Quality:
Excellent quality thick board used for the majority of pieces. The parcel tiles are thin, but work best that way. I especially enjoy the artwork on the role cards.

Gameplay:
My all-time favorite game. All the mechanics work together so smoothly. It's competitive, but not in a really nasty way. Love the old west theme and the opportunity for players who are trailing behind to duel for a chance to catch up a little. It's also nice that there are variants in the game for more expert play styles and less chancey dice-focused games. I've heard the complaint that there's too much micro-management in keeping track of the property incomes, but I enjoy flipping all of the tiles 

Overall: This is my perfect game. What others see as flaws I see as fun. I will always be willing to play Carson City.

Also, the expansion is awesome if you can get your hands on it.

I've heard this game called "Caylus with guns". While Caylus is a much deeper game, that phrase does a pretty good job of describing Carson City. I particularly like the city building aspect of the game. Not only do you have to choose what actions to take, but you need to pay attention to how Carson City is developing and what that means for the income of your buildings. The interaction in the game is terrific and the thematic integration is very strong. For me, however, the game loses points for the rulebook. Parts of the rulebook are subject to varying interpretations, and there are lots of little rules that are easy to miss. Having played this game twice now, I'm still finding that there are rules that we've misplayed. Looking forward to playing this one again.

This game isn't kind to new players.  A real brain burner but sometimes the dice rolls can really swing things.  This can be a good thing in games but with the amount of thought that goes into the game and then you get blasted can be really harsh.  I can see how some will really like this it's got some heavy conflict which seems to end the game close.  For me, I think its a good gam but I'm not sure it fun.  This is one of those that really needs multiple plays to get a good feel on it.  As for the theme I'm just not feeling it.  More of a sim city with random turns whihc might represent the old west well but just didn't quite hit the mark with me.

Really enjoy this marriage of role selection and tile placement. The variability of personality roles, available buildings, and town layout makes for very dynamic gameplay. You can set up some nice strategic synergies, but you also need to very tactical about which buildings to grab and where to place them. And the duels over action selection give you another element to worry about - the firepower arms race. It goes without saying that the interraction in Carson City is through the roof. And that's just the way I like my games.

Interesting game. Over four rounds players develop the town of Carson claiming plots of land. The objective is to finish with the highest victory points - you can do this in various way, buildings are worth points at the end and during the game you can exchange money or score points for plots, buildings, and guns. This is worker placement but there is an interesting gunfight mechanism to determine who takes a particular action in  a conflict.
My appreciation was slightly marred because in my first game I won by well over 20 points, the game seems hugely dependent on initial position and opening moves.

1st pl seems to have too big an advantage - he gets the best mine site AND 1st pick of the roles so he takes the sheriff and claims the guns thus prob ensuring both the cheap mine AND the best VP spot

after 3rd game:
not so sure - feels like there is little to do to counter the 'bullies' and a couple of bad rolls at the end can give a 10pt swing (in a 50pt winning game). could just be im playing it wrong and i do like a lot of it so keen to play more to find out but im doubtful now...

played a 2pl game and good fun tho not as tight as 4pl - think above fears were groundless cos more ways to win which are not so obv at start

nice mix of euro and CFS but mb a little too much euro so max rating prob 8

Old west themed place meeples for actions game.  But as in the old west, when two (or more) folks want something - it's revolvers at 50 paces.  OK, historical accuracy might be missing, but at least nice to be try to use an action that others have already claimed.  A lot of moving parts when you first hear the rules explained, but they tend to mesh together after a round or two.  Theme likely to be the attractive factor for this one.

Not a bad game. I enjoy other worker placement games more. This one seemed too focused on money->VP conversions which made it a bit dull. I wasn't fond of all the combat as well. If someone leads you in combat, they can negate every action you do in the final round.

Carson City: Gold & Guns Expansion
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
22-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. I was trying to hunt a copy of Carson City because I was curious. I am sad to say I didn't like the game at all!

In Carson City you are trying to build a city. Each round you select a role, that gives you a special ability but also limits the amount of money you can keep from round to round. Each round, you get a number of workers that you send out one-by-one following the other players turns around an action track that is resolved in order. Many of the actions allow you to get resources (guns, money, plots), build buildings on your plots (that produce money dependent on (neighboring) tiles in the city. Then, your buildings produce money and there are actions where you get VPs. The interesting twist in the game is the competition, if you place our worker at the same action as another worker you fight. You also can start a fight when you place your worker at the building of another player. When resolving the action space, both players roll a die, add the amount of guns you have and the loser gets their meeple returned for next round and the winner takes the action. In case the meeple was attacking a building, you get half the income from the building.

I didn't really like Carson City, mainly because of one choice that happened during the game. First off, I don't like that your workers can get shot. That REALLY can screw over your plans. In addition, I didn't like one of the roles (Sheriff), which who gets an additional meeple that can't be shot. As you can convert your income into VPs for 10 (or 5 in the last round if you take the action), the game becomes scripted if the Sheriff takes the action, all people start beating on the Sheriffs income while they can't score points themselves anymore. I DO like interaction in games, but here it felt random and forced you into scripted actions, which made an otherwise enjoyable game dud completely for me.

A friend told me this game is very much like Age of Empires III. I just had to try it after that because it's my favorite game and it is his as well.

I got to play it at Gamefest South 3 and I feel in love. It really is so very similar to AoE III that I feel that with multiple plays, this game can be another favorite and hit the 10/10 mark for me.

The new mechanic of killing off other people workers to move in to the area they were standing doesn't appeal to me. I also don't like the randomness with which the buildings for purchase appear and it's a bit too short for my liking. Overall, despite quite liking the theme, the mechanics of role selection and building the town, the game didn't click for me and I would rather play some other, more regular worker placement. I will give it a second try some time, though.

RATING: 9
A slow first outing as rules were sorted out and players got their heads around all the bits, scoring and income sources. I'd like to spend more time concentrating on playing my own game next time instead of answering rules queries - a lot of questions pop up during the course of your first game. Still only a 95 minute game - this should go down to just over an hour with experienced players. The duels are a nice touch to the Caylus mechanic. Add character cards, slap on the wild west theme, add plenty of scoring options and you've got a decent game with a few variant options to choose from with future plays. Still, there's a lot to take in for first time players and unfortunately this will hinder the likelihood of the game hitting the table in future.

Update: Liking this a little more now - gone up in my ranking. The rules are actually rather simple - just follow the theme. I find the dueling aspect to be refreshing for the worker placement genre. The way it's been done is clever - it doesn't take over the game - the balancing has been done just right. Multiple paths to victory - a good game. I think Caylus might be for the trade pile - I'd rather play this any day.

A perfectly serviceable extension of Caylus to include city building, but it reminded me a lot of Cuba - despite being beautifully constructed, I'd still rather play the originals (no matter how flawed they were.)
Oh, and the housekeeping was a pain.  Getting the income right is a tedious process that seems prone to error even with experience.

Cool themed game, the wild west. Defend from outlaws (other players), calculate you income and expenditures carefully, every $1 counts, and expand your empire to increase income. Income/Dollars are then converted to victory points.
A fairly quick game to play, ~50 mins for 2, +25 min per extra player.

This game is very much a deep strategy game, especially with 4 or more players, don't let the theme fool you in thinking its Ameritrash, because it isn't.

RATING: 7
Carson City has elements from many kinds of games. It has area control, worker placement (albeit, modified worker placement, as you can challenge people over spaces), city building, and role selection. Getting points is a big deal, as you have to take the spots that give point to get any worthwhile quantities. There seems to be a good amount of strategy, and the mechanics are well integrated. You can focus on increasing your firepower, getting many buildings down, getting a lot of land, getting money, or some combination thereof.

The best game I own. If somebody says this game is flawed, or too luck driven, get them to play it a second time. Also, it is only a brain-burner to a point. The rolls add a bit of randomness which eliminates extended AP. This is not going to have you sitting around in silence thinking as is the case with Caylus and Power Grid.

Disappointing - the direct conflict, and luck of the dice were unappealing to me in a game of this type. I think the combat could have been done much better. (I understand there are variants to address this - I'd like to check them out) - I found the game tantalisingly close to be being very good apart from the luck element which virtually ruined it for me (and I won so this is not sour grapes!) 

There's been a lot of comparison to Caylus, and the similarities are clear - place all workers, then activate them, moving down a road. The "screw you" element in Caylus though, the movement of the Provost, is infinitely more elegant, than the lucky dice roll of this game. Surely this issue has been addressed in some variants? The rest of it is interesting - the characters and buildings - and the interaction of the buildings is cool - although somewhat unthematic - for example - a drugstore will surely benefit from ALL houses around it regardless of which player built them? This would make interaction between buildings even more interesting. Anyway - this is close to being a very good game but for the lazy design decision to insert dice combat, IMHO.

Only four rounds, which seems so short. Only a few scoring spaces, which seems so few.

But it seems to work well as a worker placement game. Not overly thrilled with dice based combat (as usual), but the recompense is pretty good. I use the two gun character card instead of the three gun one. I make the three gun token worth two guns for combat purposes and three guns for reward calculation. Otherwise, the person who wins the race for the gun (which is luck) simply waltzes through the rest of the round, and that's neither fair nor fun.

[4 plays] My rating will go way up or way down, and I will fall madly in love with this in another play or two - or it will hit the trade pile.

There is so much going on in the first game, and I was a severely handicapped learner last night, so I got truly smoked. But I see a very interesting game here. There are a variety of ways to go after victory points I suspect, but I can't trust my judgment on that yet - having played so poorly.

More to say later ...

Update 12-30-10: Second play under my belt. I really like it and I understand a bunch more - although there is much more to discover I think. This is a definite keeper, and I look forward to playing it again soon. More than most games, I think this one really benefits from a couple of plays since there are so many wide open choices to explore.

Worker Placement, Economic. Tough game, it feels like Caylus with more theme and more chaos by way of the gunfighting when fighting over chosen actions. I need to play it a few more times to see if I really like it; right now, I don't feel like I need to own this compared to Caylus, and I prefer the more deterministic worker-placement of Caylus to this.

Very fun and different worker placement game.

We use the variant where The Ammunition space cannot be used by people who current have the most revolvers on their hand (not counting cowboys).

Without this variant the person currently in lead can take this space and increase his lead even more, making him unstoppable. Especially in the last round where he can just take this space and then take all the scoring spaces. All other players depending on getting one of this spaces for points will have a hard time winning.

Érdeklődéssel ültem le a Carson City-hez. Korábban már hallottam az egész szabályát, az alapján elég bonyolultnak találtam és tényleg nem könnyű első játékra mindent átlátni. 5 játékos esetén már szerintem elég nehéz minden épület bevételét jól beállítani, figyelni kell ne essen ebben hiba. A játék amúgy egy Caylus, Citadella és Tigris keveréke elsőre, másodikra se sokkal több csak egy kis konfliktustörténettel, amiben viszont alapesetben szerepet játszik a kocka. A vadnyugati hangulathoz hozzá tartozik, de sosem szeretem ha egy komoly játékot kockával bolondítanak meg, így ebben sem tetszett ez. Szerencsére van kocka nélküli variáns is a szabályban, de maga a párbajkonfliktus sem hiányozna alapvetően számomra a játékból. Tehát a társas már jól bevált elemekből építkezik. Szerepválasztás, akciómezőválasztás és lapkalerakás. Semmi újdonságot nem lehet felfedezni benne, de nem rossz az összegyúrás. Nálam tipikus 6-os játék. Semmi extra, egy kevésbé tetsző résszel erős 6-os.

[2012-11-10]
A második játékra romlott a kép. Nagyon macera figyelni az egyes épületek helyes bevételét, a kocka nagyon nagy szerencseszerepet visz a játékba. Túl sokat markoltak a készítők, talán a kevesebb több lett volna. A kocka nélküli változatnak még adnom kellene egy esélyt, de nem valószínű, hogy fogok, akkor ha esetleg mégis összejönne lehet emelek majd egyet a most lerontott ponton.

It's a bizarro version of Way out West.  Rather than trying to build specific buildings that try to play off of what others have built, this is much more self involved.  This game pushes the Caylus model into something with more direct conflict.  If someone takes the spot you wanted, try to take it from them.  Plus, there is some Aqueduct/Santiago going on with the roads.  Honestly, there really isn't anything new here, but everything is mixed in such a way that it feels unique.  It works well.

I really love the living map that changes per game and grows as you play through it.  

Sure there is a random element to the dice, but really it isn't so bad.  There are many ways to defer this.

All in all a great game.

Worker placement, which is great -- and the theme is there, too.  The track is something that I'd have to get used to and probably like in the end.  But something about the abstractness of laying out the buildings and connecting them didn't sit well with me.

Played twice. Liked it very much. At first I felt it was gonna be a harsh game, but it worked very well. It's a worker placement game with a twist. Once you've used a worker it goes to the general stock so you can't automatically use it next round. Also, you can have multiple workers placed on the same square and they have to duel to determine who gets to take the action. Talk about interaction. My only complaint is that the game is long, especially with AP players, and I don't get a lot of opportunity to play long games these days.

This one is hard to comment on without more plays and not sure if its a worker placement rehash or something entirely new altogether. But initially it feels like a Western themed Caylus with a great "duel" mechanism to satisfy those borderline Grognards and a super fiddly points system.

Don't be fooled by the time of play on the outside of the box. This is a very deep game with wonderful replayability on an ever changing board.

Carson City stands out from the majority of worker placement games, as it's one of the few without yet another resource management mechanic (of which I personally grew a bit tired after Agricola, Caylus, Stone Age et cetera). Instead, this game has a strong spatial element and introduces direct conflict. Players are building the town of Carson City and contest for the best parcels and the best buildings. A role selection mechanic gives players certain benefits, opening a ton of different strategies. The worker placement mechanic feels fresh, since it adds a new kind of turn angst. Because more than one player can select the same action a duel has to be fought to decide who can perform said action. There are ways to migigate this, but this will cost you extra -valueable- actions. The variant where duels are fought with the blind bidding tiles is highly recommended for a more strategic experience.
Carson City is a game with many layered subleties, like the dual turn order mechanics and the cash limits associated with each role. Since the game lasts only four rounds and actions are really scarce, each decision is impotant and meaningful. These two factors make Carson City a very strategic game.

Gold & Guns is a great expansion as it adds more roles, and you now play the game with a random mix of 7 roles. This adds a lot of replayability and strategic depth as new scoring paths open up and change every game.

Owned expansions: Gold & Guns, A New Beginning.

This game is pretty thematic, and has a nice Wild West theme built into it. I like the way in which the action track resolves in order, like Caylus, and I enjoy the different kinds of buildings and how they work together and affect the board. The dueling can seem a bit random, and too much seems to be won or loss on an individual die roll, and we should play with a variant to reduce the luck in the future.

This definitely straddles the line between Euro and Ameritrash. I love the theme, the general Eurogame concepts of worker placement and scoring victory points; I also love how if you don't like what someone else is doing, challenge them to a duel. It'll certainly make them think twice about deliberately sabotaging your game!

If you don't want direct interaction in your Eurogame, this game is not for you. But I love it; I think it also works well with all player numbers.

*Traded. Good game but not a favourite with my wife or gaming group. Also firepower seems really important and the clincher in the final round.

1 play, 4er

An interesting role-selection, worker-placement, economic, tile-laying/controlling, city-building (buildings come out in random order) game with a western theme. Worker placement is a bit modified, as cowboys can duel over the same action! Unfortunately, the basic dueling rules (add your gun strength to a d6) seem to be overly random, and the variant (using tiles 0-5, that are all mixed and dealt randomly!) doesn't seem to be much better! Why not just give everyone their 0-5 and play with those?!

Pretty enjoyable, even with the basic rules. Looking forward to trying the advanced role tiles, and better dueling rules!

Oh, good production value except for one thing: who the hell cuts/folds a board like that?!?

A mixed bag for me.  I like the gunfights, the dice, managing your cowboys, the financial aspect, and the character choices.  I don't like the tile placement and the game seems too long for one that should often boil down to some key dice rolls.

This game is also very programed like Royal Palace, Xavier Georges previous game. I like Carson City enough to actually want to play it from time to time although it's not my kind of game. It reminds me of Caylus of course. I find it very hard to manage everything that's happening during gameplay because there are always lots of difficult small things going on. The type of scoring it's not new and it's very unconfortable for me. I'm always searching for the small icons on the building tiles trying to get things right.

Played again as a two player game and found it a lot more fun and a lot more straighforward. It lacks some "crowedness" on the board. Everything builds slower and with a lot more space but I like that slow growing feeling fighting only for the small important things. Still deciding how to rate it though because I really need some more experience with more players.

Carson City has an interesting take on worker placement.  Namely, you get to duel other players for spots on the worker placement track.  This creates some fun interaction; but ultimately it adds an unplanned wrench in the works to an otherwise well oiled game.  The fighting for spots can be a kingmaker type of move.  As with many multiplayer conflict games, the looser of a fight, can quickly fall behind, not something that modern euro's take kindly too.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some conflict, but in a seemingly medium weight worker placed net euro, it just doesn't fit.  It boils down to this, if I am playing a euro, and I get crushed, it should be because I made bad decisions, here, I can get crushed if another player deems it so.  I do want ot play it again to see if my initial assesment is accurate.

RATING: 5
It was really fun up until the ending where the game was literally decided by a series of dice rolls.  That made the entire exercise feel relatively pointless.  The sad thing is I only needed to make one of the dice rolls to win, but even with the preponderance of cowboys I got back, I just couldn't do it.  If that were to happen again, I'd definitely not play the game again.  As it is, I'm not sure it will get another shot.

Worker placement with some pretty nasty direct conflict. Not to everyone's taste, but I liked it well enough. I think the potential for conflict serves mostly as a deterrent and the other aspects of the game (e.g. income build-up vs. opportunistic VP collection) also make for an interesting game.

5/17/12: It was not a bad game, but it failed to generate any sort of excitement for me, which is weird since I like Western themes, I like worker placement, and I like role selection.  I wouldn't say it was dry per se, but there was a lack of any sort of momentum in the game.

5/31/12: I keep winning at this game and I have no idea why.  The role selection is far more important than the worker placement, which can be contested except against the Sheriff.  I have a feeling my rating is inflated because I keep winning, although I do win by a narrow margin usually.

great worker placement game set in the Wild West. Players buy parcels on a lare piece of land among a river. On the parcels they can construct houses, ranches, saloons,...and lot sof other buildings. Each round they also pick a role (like banker, captain,...) wich offers them unique abilities. The game is played over 4 rounds, points are being bought with money, with diminishing returns as the game progresses.

RATING: 2
Fundamentally the game is a very poor design which is close enough to being broken amongst competitive players as to make it no fun at all.  The problem stems from the gunfight aspect.  Because of the accumulative nature of the revolvers, the design forces players to literally only collect guns and/cowboys for the first two turns of the four turn game, and further when the prisons come out.  If anyone is given the chance to collect a majority in revolvers they are unstoppable and everyone must play for second place--while its possible for another player to jump on the grenade to stop a gun heavy player, it just means neither will win and one of the other players will take the top spot.  An additional problems lies in the fact that there are far too any decision points when placing the cowboys and the game takes an inordinate amount of time--sure it could be played in 90 minutes but if you want to play well it'll take at least 2.5 hours and probably 3.  The game is nowhere near good enough to justify that amount of time.

RATING: 4
Carson City is Caylus with violence: a shorter, more brutal re-implementation of the road system. It isn't "worker placement"; it's "gunfighter placement" -- if another player takes a space you want, you can fight them for it. Buildings aren't placed on the road, but on a grid. You can rob directly rob another player's building of income, or build around it to make that income go away. It's incredibly cutthroat.

I was thrilled to finally play this game and expected to love it. I want to give it another try because I can't believe how much I hated that first play. There was nothing in particular -- I even didn't mind the dice.

My problem, I think, is the *kind* of decisions it forces: in most of the games I love, I feel like I'm trying to choose the best of many good possibilities. So many opportunities, so little time! In Carson City I felt like I was choosing the least worst.

1 play.  I'm a big fan of games where the theme fits the mechanics, and this is one of them.  There seemed to be several strategies and it felt like none of them were a poor choice.  I can see now that I understand the game, the NEXT game would have quite a bit more dueling in it.  This could be quite a nasty game--Always stealing from other players and success comes down to a die roll!

An 'earn cash, buy VP' worker-placement game, but with the fundamental defect of rewarding bullies rather than planners: plan what you like, but if you lack fire power you'll lose a lot. Thematic? I think not - in the Wild West if I had lots of cash I'm pretty sure I could go hire some hot-shots to drive the bullies away. Not in this game, I can’t!
 
I've tried both the basic duelling rules and the 'might is right' variant, and neither works for me. Players with more fire-power tend to win duels and get the chance to acquire yet more fire-power. There is no compensation for losing; no alternate (non-competitive) way to get more fire-power - like simply buying in hired guns.

Carson City is a terrific take on worker-placement games.  The innovative mechanism of the duels is really quite awesome and adds a lot of unpredictability to a normally predictable situation.

The game works surprisingly well as a 2-player hence the rating of 7.  I strongly suspect this one to go up when I finally get to play it with multiple players.

Carson City is an enjoyable worker placement game with plenty of options to increase your scoring.  It's short so this must be taken into consideration from the start.  The first turn feels a little empty but then it accelerates so quickly into the plan.  The decision of which character to take is fun and helps you out of situations where the current plan has faltered a bit. 

I have not played enough to discover variable strategies other than fight for the right to get the cheap victory point spot.  I want to believe there is a big money strat that allows you to ignore the vp purchases and concentrate on other things like major property incomes.  We will see.

I like the duels.  It makes it different and is something more like a cold war.  The revolvers just seem to stack up by game end and can be a viable point grab.  In a 4 player game fighting is a must so they become very important.

The buildings combos and alternate point bursts remind me of Cuba.  This one is way more fun and flows much better without unnecessary cube converting and such.

Thoughts on 2p : Must be played on the tighter Carson River side of the board.  It seems getting in the face of your opponent is a must to create tension.  If players decide to do their own thing then the game can feel mechanical and missing something.  This makes me see the beauty of Agricola 2 player.

4p : We felt the sheriff was too powerful on the yellow side and will be using the red side for future games.  I had the task of calculating incomes and checking for income changes.  It's the fiddliest part of the game but the coolest. It was a little tough with 2 glasses of wine but not terribly so.  

Must remember to pass!

Really needs more than 2 players unless those two players really want to get down and dirty with stealin' & shootin'.

I was a little underwhelmed with this. It promised so much and was only ... decent.

Update: It's actually a pretty clever WP game that plays in a sensible amount of time (and seems faster than it is). The downside being that the dueling mechanism which makes the game stand out can also result in players being shut out for a whole round or more which is essentially devastating.

Update 2: I'm seeing rounds where the dice go against a player too often and they end up with nothing from an entire round. That's too punishing for a game with as few rounds as this game has and is a major issue for me.

Hát én nagyot csalódtam benne. Mondom ezt egy 3 fôs parti után. Abszolút semmi konfrontáció nem volt! És nem azért mert hû de rendesek voltunk egymással, egyszerûen nem volt értelme párbajozni! Minek csatázzunk ha semmi kockázattal is tudok prosperáló akciót végrehajtani.

Talán 5 fôs partiban több a párbaj hiszen akkor jóval több cowboy figura is van, de így hárman abszolúte nem volt szükség rá. És a játék témája a vadnyugat szinte elképzelhetetlen ilyen összetûzések nélkül, és a játékban is elég fontos szerepet kap a párbaj. És még ketten is lehet játszani, jesszasz!

A grafika persze szép, de ez még nem minden.


Most direkt játszottam még egy 4 fôs partit is. Itt már több volt a párbaj, de még mindig nem az a "mindent fegyverrel intézek" el feeling ment:D Többet kell játszani és akkor talán rájövök az ízére, az viszont tény hogy békésebb játékosoknak nem nyújt akkor élményt mintha mondjuk ultra focidrukkerek játszanának egy partit:D

Carson City isn't bad, but it was one of my most anticipated games of 2010 (Caylus in the Wild West!) and fell short of expectations. My biggest problem with the game is that it can be decided by shootouts in the final round. There's a lot you can do to improve your gunfighting skill throughtout the game, but other players are doing the same and victory often hinges on a lucky die roll or two. To me, the game is just too long and involved to leave the winner to chance like that.

Quite a brain burner with lots of options. It really feels like a morph of Caylus and Oregon combined with some income generation tied to the buildings. I like how the buildings interact, making for different strategic options. Can be a bit nasty with the duels, but it should even out as players receive their cowboy lost in battle. Definitely need to play more (with different dueling rules) to explore some more strategies. Very nice components which are mostly functional.

Carson City is jammed full of good ideas!  Too many, in fact.  The rules are counterintuitive, and some chunks of gameplay, like roads, aren't worth the hassle.  But these are quibbles compared to the overpowered dice shootouts.  Each one is stronger than the previous, until they achieve game-breaking proportions.  There are certain things I demand in a 2+ hour game, and one of them is that my score can't double in the last 60 seconds from a single dice roll. (!)

unfortunately we just got 1/2 a game in
-------

Full game played now. Unfortunately its most unique feature is also its biggest weakness. When I heard of this confrontational worker placement I thought it's a good idea to alter your regular concept of workerplacement which goes "Oh! So you want the carrots? Well, you've been here first. Go ahead. I'll take some wheat instead" into something quite the opposite, but unfortunately the game is just too confrontational and in desperate need of balancing. Once a player falls behind with the pistols the player(s) with more guns can bully him around. In terms of theme it might be quite coherent to have the way of the gun, but when you cannot make any decisions but your opponents are playing you, then there's something seriously wrong. And once you're behind with guns it's in the hands or rather the good will of your opponent(s) wether they will or will not allow you to catch up. Also, I have a strong feeling that the game is scripted in a way that the amount of duels will skyrocket during round 4 of every single game, because everyone wants to use the last possibility to score and as many of those last possibilities as possible. Endgame score was 31-31-18, but could have easily been 31(31)-28(18)-25(31).

I really loved my first few plays of this one.  The components are fantastic, the rules are clear.  The theme is fantastic, and the game is a mix of several different game mechanics that blend really well.

Worker placement game that also has a little bit of role selection, which I like.

However, the game, especially with two players, seems a bit short. There are only four rounds, and with two players they go by very quickly. Also, it can be hard to remember all of the rules for each building. Some of them require you to build a house onto the board, some of them have to be placed next to a road, some of them can be placed anywhere. I've made myself a little cheatsheet to help with this and it makes the game flow smoother.

There's also a broken strategy that involves taking the character that gives you guns then taking the space that gives you guns. I've read online that playing with that set of characters (which is the set that the rules recommend using) does have balance problems and you should use the alternative characters. That's not very promising.

Sold.

Xavier Georges has another hit with our group, hes 4 for 4 with my group.  We play a few very tense games last night, where it seemed like there was a run away leader until the last round and it completely changed.  In only 4 rounds there are some very tough decisions to be made.  Some randomness, especially with gun fights, though our group is out for blood so anything in a euro with player to player conflict seems to work out well for us.  
Worker placement, area control.  

This will hit the table much more now that we've got it down!

Once you've played a few worker-placement games, and you want one with a little more teeth, this is one that I would recommend. The idea to allow battling for position on the action spaces is fantastic, and the way it's implemented here is really well done. I haven't tried the dice-less variant, but I suspect there would be some pros and cons. I'll always have a copy of this game in my collection. It's just a classic implementation of a classic mechanism with a classic theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I can't see this one climbing past the 8.5 I currently give it, but it is currently a favorite.

First off, I like the theme. Western themes are still bit underrepresented in my opinion.

Second, superficially one has a LOT of choices, but one can smartly whittle them down to a few best ones. And if you can't, purchase the ability to get more (if you have the opportunity to select the correct personality that is). And if you don't have a lot of good choices, save your selections for next year.

You see, the point is one not only has a lot of choices, but, more importantly, one has a lot of flexibility. Planning is essential and the decision tree is fairly large, BUT, and this is also important, it is not unwieldy. Something I find frustrating in a game like Dominant Species.

I tend to like tactical games and playing from the gut a bit more than games with broad strategic horizons and perfect information. Carson City is a good compromise. A strategy is important and there are many to employ, but I am not at all overwhelmed. 

Another way to put it is that I can always look back on my games and immediately see the large and small mistakes I made. I appreciate that.

I also love the inclusion of duels. It helps the theme, presents a nice twist action drafting, adds some depth to decision making and keeps things lively. It was a great design decision to allow the loser to get their cowboy back. If one lost their cowboy I think the game might be driven too much in the direction of guns and saving cowboys. Choices would narrow.

Two complaints: 
One, is that it takes quite awhile to explain. I prefer to get people playing and explain the game as we go, but one has to explain all the spaces on the action track and their context. Consequently one has to explain nearly all of the rules before starting. 

Two, there are a lot of rules. Little rules and things you have to remember. It all means that there is a larger barrier to entry than I generally prefer in a game. It is too bad because I'd love to share this game with more people.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2

My first worker placement game. Played once so far, but I like it.
4 rounds seems like very little time, and indeed there is still a lot I want to do when the game ends, but that's probably the beauty of this game. Also, the board fills up very quickly, so there would be building placement issues if the game continued past the end of 4th round.

Edit: have got a couple more plays in and I can tell that it's a very solid game. Choices all around, and the need to balance how many actions you take against how strong you will be in duels is also very cool.

2 of the logged plays have used my copy of the game.

UPDATE: Now that I own my very own copy of the game I've been able to play it more and still love it. Doesn't work as a 2 player game at all though and that will stop it from ever going higher. I can see this rating dipping a bit to maybe 8 over time but not sure. Just have to see how some things work out with it.

I enjoy Carson City because, like a lot my favorite games, it offers a ton of choices as you play the game.

It incorporates several successful mechanics from other great games, including varying "roles" from turn to turn (like Puerto Rico) and area control skullduggery.

It feels like there is a ton of game here, and the replay value is quite high.

Update 1/16/2013: Man, this game is great.  Once players understand the mechanics and really start getting into it, the game really takes off.  This could very well be the best area control game I own.  I don't think it will ever be my favorite game in my collection, but it is simply outstanding and a joy to play.  Bumped rating to a 9.

There is a lot I like here.  Role selection, buildings that vary in value based on what's going on, worker placement for actions... but I wonder if the gunfighting is a little too random.  In my first play the first and third place players would have switched positions if the dice had come down differently in the last round.  There is a variant which supposedly addresses this, but it sounded like it really didn't.  I'd love to see a variant that took out random element from the resolution of gunfights or just eliminated gunfights altogether.

Decent game but as far as worker placement games go, there are several (many?) that I would choose to play before Carson City.

I also feel that the sheriff is way too powerful in the final round, thus making passing first in the 3rd round all important.  In the games I've played (only 2) I found that in both cases the person who had the sheriff in the 4th round won.

A wonderful application of role selection, spicing things between games too, and all the ideas spiral smoothly into the game, the duels that energize things & how it introduces a bit of dice luck & tension that doesn't drive the game so so much as make for bluff & tempting hole digging at the go-for-broke choice shadowing every turn. a neat player dynamic. The charm of the theming feels seamless. The building of a town a real pleasure. By far the best worker placement game out there, and with play could be a 9 or 10.

All in an hour. Great narrative arc.

I wish the BGG game churn would stop so people would play this. It's made to sustain regular play and having fun with the introduction of different roles and small designer variants. A very cool design with interstitial humor leaking out all over the place. 

And highly accessible.

Carson City is a strategic game. The game is played in 4 rounds and in each one of them the players choose a character (there are 7 available) that gives certain advantages, after that cowboys are placed on action fields on the board to build Carson city. Players can claim ground, erect special buildings, houses or construct roads. When there are several players on 1 action field, a duel is fought. During play, money (to construct) & points can be earned. The player who earns most points wins the game.

Some decent subsystems, but the whole is less than the sum of its parts. There are too many actions which are too similar, so whether or not you duel with another player is often quite arbitrary - and losing a duel is significant. The fact that only your buildings and neutral houses work with your buildings mean that there is little interest in parcel selection - basically everyone wants a big block. Etc.

The basic duel rules are terrible - having a small number of very significant die rolls is not good design. In the second game we used the tiles variant, which is better but also not great, as a very low or a very high total is bad (the latter due to the low cash). 

I suspect that the alternate character powers are better than the basic ones, so it is possible that with enough official and unofficial variants (e.g., give out fixed sets of duel tiles) a better game could emerge, but I should not have to figure this out. If there is a best way to play the game, THAT should be the basic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
For me, this game offers too many computable options for me to be really enjoyable. It is hard work! On the other hand, it combines them with some 'take that' elements (particularly the shoot outs) that do not blend well with its mathematical main mechanic. And my last gripe is that the amount of action and building specific rules make it quite hard to explain to newcomers. There are certainly better optimization games out there, but I would not mind playing it every once in a while (if someone else brought it to the table).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A high conflict Eurogame that is not in my taste. Technically speaking, there is nothing wrong with the game per se. This is a standard Euro game of worker placement and role selection with a huge dose of combat to antagonize each other. There appears to be multiple strategies to pick up a few victory points here and there, but one has to quickly adapt to strategies adopted by others. If one player in the group goes marauding and picks up a trove of reckless cowboys to terrorize the town, then it matters not if you are the richest or most influential person in town. You will have to constantly protect yourself by arming your own group of thugs to prevent constant pillaging. If you play this game like any engine building game to generate wealth and points, you will likely lose in a frustrating manner as your position will be constantly targeted by duels. In our games, play revolves around the duels way too much to be entertaining. There is constant die rolling to resolve duels with some players completely dominating the board with multiple guns. Not my cup of tea. Too much of a dice-fest even though I love player interactions.

Rating based on one play.  The best worker placement game I have ever contemplated.  A fun fun game with a brain burning depth..... So many  choices! 

Players take turns putting down their little cowboy folk.  You can squat on plots of land, and then build businesses on them (saloons, banks, ranches, whore houses (kidding)).  They earn you money. But you have a ton of other choices too, such as earn a victory point for every two plots you have, buy a victory point for 3 dollars a point, get three roads, get three guns, etc.  All of these things you get by placing one of your little cowboys on a square that indicates that action. But you wait until everyone has place their cowboys before you perform the action.  If two cowboys are on the same square....a duel...and one remains.

Will play more........want to right now.

Decisions are generally fairly tough, but there's a handful of things I'm not fond of.  The sheer randomness of duels is probably my biggest complaint; this is somewhat offset in the earlier rounds as you don't lose the action entirely, but it is crushing in the final rounds.

Tracking your income each round is pretty fiddly as it changes round to round.  Aspects of the game feel awkwardly tacked on, such as the saved money cap.  The variant roles also seem questionably balanced, with the Coolie being ridiculously strong compared to the others.

Overall if you're actively interested in a worker placement game with a lot of dueling randomness it's probably worth checking out, but isn't the game for me.

Also really a fan of the built in variability through role cards and alternate board.  Great game!

RATING: 3.5
A strategic looking game with random dice duels, which might screw some actions. Maybe a critical one in just one of the rounds (1 of 4) but if you fall behind in a 90min game and sit the rest of the game knowing its now an uphill battle, this may not be the experience you'd like to make.
I don't think this elements fit well together and don't like this kind of random "you're screwed" elements.

There is a low luck variant included, which might lower the influence of those. However, I doubt those would increase my interest in the game much, maybe rising it to something like ~5?

I don't get all the Caylus comparisions, the similarities are superficial at best, as there's a road that determines which order actions are done in. Other than that, everything is different. :whistle:

I enjoyed our game, except for the gun tile variant that was used. A hidden tile variant (instead of announcing the overall strength of your gun tiles to the world at game start) or the dice system in the rules would have been better. I got the feeling that this a game that just needs a good number of players, so the only reason it's not on my purchase list is that we mostly play 2 player.

Perhaps my rating of 7 is generous, but I did enjoy my one play so far of this game. I have a creeping suspicion though that it might not hold up well with repeat plays. The gunfight mechanic is a clever twist to the worker placement mechanic, but ultimately I'm unsure of whether there's enough else going on to hold this one together. The geography of the board was mildly interesting but seemed to set the stage for mostly obvious decisions. The ways of getting money as well as those for converting it to VP just seemed too simplistic. This might be a medium weight in a heavy game's clothing. Which is fine, but then I won't feel the need to own it.

It's an accelerated and more strategic version of Troyes, so I would say it's a great game. It works with any number of players, it's tactical but allows you to steal o fight for the actions, instead of just wait for the other player to block you. If Caylus had had sex with Troyes and they had had a baby with the best of both, It would be like Carson City.

Carson City is a rootin' tootin' game of cowboys 'n guns - lots o' guns.
\13\\13\
There are 4 rounds per game. At the beginning of each round, players choose a character (there are 7 available) that gives them certain advantages (for example the sheriff prevents any duels from happening wherever he is placed).
\13\\13\
After selecting characters, your cowboys are placed on action track locations that allow you to construct buildings, houses or roads; claim ground; earn money; or score victory points. When more than one player is on the same location, get ready, it is time for a duel! Roll the dice and see if you are the last one standing and lay claim to the goods!
\13\\13\
During the game, you can take various actions that earn you victory points for your plots, pistols (the hired help) and buildings. At the end of the game, your buildings, houses, mountains and money contribute to your victory points and the person with the most points wins. So go round up your posse of gunslingers and get ready for some Wild West action in Carson City!

Based on one play. I enjoyed this, but am skeptical how I feel about the "interaction" involved in gunfights. Basically, the person who taught me the game played better than the rest of us, with me being in second place. Because he was so far ahead, everyone screwed him repeatedly and eventually I squeaked into first.

The guy was a good sport about it, but for low-variance games, I prefer that the player that clearly outplays everyone else wins. If I am the best player and lose, I want it to be because of bad luck, not because every other player gang-raped me.

I'd have to play a few more times to want to buy this.

1 game with 2; 1 game with 3. Carson City is a conversion engine with worker placement and role selection, which are not my preferred mechanics.  However, CC allows workers to be placed on the same action, and a "shoot out" decides who can take the action.  This added dimension of direct conflict makes CC very interesting and a lot of fun for me.  This is one of my favorite worker placement games.  Works better with more players.  I think 3 works well, and 4 may be best.  I think 5 would bog the game down.

Worker placement with some teeth to it and also a spatial aspect. I love it when a game takes fun and interesting mechanics and then combines them to make a game you haven't played before. I'd like to get this to the table more.

Meh. My opinion of this game may have been affected by the confusion regarding rules and the lack of enthusiasm on the part of other players. For me, there was just too much going on at once. Far too much to keep track of and consider, but it was not a painful gaming experience. I did not hate the game, I just did not like it particularly either. Neutral opinion.

First play was great fun.  We quickly got immersed into the theme.  You know it is a good game when you want to play again and try something different.  We totally were playing the personal reserve wrong when losing a duel and that your cowboys can be held over into following rounds.  That should lessen the power of the Black Bart!

The more I play this, the more I like it - there are genuine multiple paths to victory and the theme is rich. Complaints are: a couple of rules are too fiddly (the Church for instance) - also the maths element of this is a bit much occasionally.

Other than Agricola, maybe my most played game.  As a worker placement, it does not get any better than this.  I love the duels and how if you don't move first, you don't like a chance at an action.

Een leuke twist aan de worker placement games. Direct conflict als spelers hetzelfde veld willen bezetten brengen het wilde westen tot leven.

Wil ik zeker vaker spelen, want één keer is zeker niet genoeg om het spel volledig te doorgronden.

It really does feel like Caylus with guns, area control and player interaction. Really enjoy the game. Some initial plays made me feel like the guns were a little too powerful, especially in the final turns. Maybe that's true with 4-5 players, I have not played enough to know. With fewer, it's more a matter of not playing into the trap. I recently played without the Might is Right variant and was surprised to find that I enjoyed it quite a bit more. One of my favorite worker placement games by far, especially because it plays so quickly. Highly recommended.

I thought I might like Carson City, because it's got a tang to it.  Dice battles determine who gets to use each worker space, and there's a spatial element to town construction and the generation of income.

But as the scene ends and we ride off into the sunset, it's still the same old worker placement mechanic. I'll never, ever play another WP game again, and this time I really mean it.  Though when you're surrounded, and low on ammo, it's tough to fight them off.

[i]Update:[/i]

I've decided to kill myself rather than play another worker placement game.  Hence the epitaph on my Boot Hill tombstone:

[i]A worker has been placed for the last time. There shall be no other.  RIP.[/i]

Worker placement where your cowboys have to buy land, build buildings, collect roads, money, and guns, and convert all of it to victory points. Very challenging game with several options on how to play. You have a 2 sided board, diceless or dice gunplay, double sided roles, so you get a lot of similar games in one box. This should be great for re-play ability.

I had a fun time with it.  To me it had a "Let's play again right now quality."  Too many things to do, never enough time (This is always a good thing).  Defintely looking forward to playing again.

Played just once and online, so i probably didn't understand all the mechanisms. But it didn't grabbed me. It looks so outdated - both the looks and the mechanisms. Connecting plots with those sticks and role selection part looked weird and old. It will have a deluxe version, but i think it needs a streamlined version, not just prettier edition.

High risk, high payoff, highly chaotic worker placement game in the same vein as Pillars of the Earth, Stone Age, and Vasco de Gama. Players receive most of their victory points from relatively few actions, with certain actions resulting in 20-30% of a player's final score, yet another player can snuff out the opportunity with a single duel. The randomness in Carson City is situational, often manifesting in situations like needing the same buildings as the Mercenary (a losing proposition, to say the least), getting picked on for winning because players can directly shaft the leader by placing on their building, or arbitrarily avoiding contention because you're the only guy who wants a particular type of building. Some things that should probably happen every game:

1st round Sheriff on the cheapest Mine/Ranch
3rd round Sheriff on $4 -> VP, ~10-15 VP's
3rd round Banker, stockpile to $120, then choose Sheriff 4th round for $5 -> VP
4th round Banker to accumulate up to $120, = 20 VP's

Four starting strategies appear automatic:

Sheriff - Cheapest Mine/Ranch
Coolie - Most expensive buildings (uncontested)
Captain - Three extra cheap tracts, $2 per tract, middle priced building
Mercenary - Cheapest buildings not Sheriff'ed, guaranteed.

This is an alright area control game, but it isn't any better than many others - and then dice are added for random conflict resolution. It's not terrible, but there are many better games about

I enjoy the twist in this game of dueling with other players and being able to place your workers on spots that other players have placed their workers. Taking this risk adds for a fun random element in the game that can be mitigated by going for gun tokens which add to your dice rolls.  Though the game does have some randomness, it is not overly random by any means and is still a Euro at hear.  To add to that, I feel like the dice rolling fits the old west theme of the game and suits it perfectly.  To put it simply, this is one of the best thematic euros you will ever play and is one that will never leave my collection.  Its a simply awesome game!   It is so much fun to build your own part of the city out west and see the entire board be built by yourself and others.  The buildings that you build serve to gain you money or other special abilities but the fear of another player playing on your building to take your income is constant.  I enjoy the snaking action spots at the top of the board, where you put your workers.  Those are laid out nicely.  One of the best aspects of the game is getting to choose a special character every round that gives you some type of in game bonus and the ability to carry over a certain amount of money in the game.  You can go for the one you want or go for one that you know your opponent desperately needs.  This is an extremely awesome game experience!  Just go get it!

The game easily met my high expectations. I bought it before playing the game, based only on how much I loved the rules, and its designer (I'm a big fan of Royal Palace). Carson City did not disappoint at the table. It is very immersive, highly thematic, and can be a bit of a brain-burner.

Edit: I have upped this game to a 10. Given that my game group likes this as much as I do, this will be played a lot! Even two of my best friends who have placed at the end of the pack in each game, still love it and want to play again.

Not bad.  I like that parcels and buildings are bought separately.  I like that there's both a Caylus-style track AND a spatially-relevant option for your workers to be placed on.  Theme is rich in Carson City.

But it feels like more of the same.  I'll stick with Caylus, Stone Age, and Pillars, all of which feel more developed and do NOT have a head-to-head dice combat mechanic.

After 1 Play: On the one hand I thought there weren't enough actions to enact a meaningful strategy.  On the other hand the actions weren't interesting, so I don't see how extending to the game could make it any better.

The biggest problem is the dueling on the money to point conversion spaces.  One roll will determine your conversion rate, and in turn drastically affect your score.

A worker placement game with good amount of player interaction: you can rob other player's buildings. It's pleasant to see a western town being build. It has an excellent role picking mechanism.  


Some minor points : 

Cowboy dice fights can sometimes decide the outcome of the game when things are close.

Enjoyed the first playing of this, largely because of the theme and game play being a bit different to loads of games that I have played recently. i.e you can have fun having duels - probably a game thats best suited to people who dont mind losing, and dont want to spend ages building a particular system.

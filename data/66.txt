Not easy to visualise at first but a very good minimum-luck game when you do. I prefer it to the re-implementation, Domaine, although the later game plays more quickly

Works very well with 2-4 players, innovative gameplay, very deep, challenging.  An underrated game despite winning the 1997 DSP.  Won't touch the remake Domaine after playing this.

Lowenherz is a very simple game that provokes some deep thinking and great tension. I have finally found a direct conflict game that avoids the typical wargame mechanics and instead provides an elegant Euro-style system for screwing with people and taking their land.

I hope to play this more often. The more I play Klaus Teuber's non-Catan games, the more I am impressed with his breadth of his game catalog. Lowenherz is one of his best.

I like this game very much. It's got lots of interesting mechanisms and has a depth of strategy in it and yet it feels fairly light to play and learn. I like the bidding, the way the end is triggered (reminded me a little of Gulo Gulo in that you know it's in the last 5 cards but don't know where), the deciding which action to go for and the balance required between grabbing cash and areas.  I wouldn't be surprised if I raised this to a 9 one day.

A fun puzzle-esque game.  Pretty good amount of player interaction.  Very much a thinking/puzzle game, but I didn't feel that it was as much a brain-burner as other games I've played.  Would play this one again.  In particular, I'd like to try a 3 or 4 player game since mine was a 2 player one (and we got a rule or two wrong).

Picked it up cheap on eBay and was shocked to see it become a group favorite. Very interactive with lots of social play based off a clever board control mechanic. Quality of the bits is slightly suspect, but the core rules are much better than Domaine (its "2nd Edition") so the bits are worth tolerating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A well designed game with some interesting mechanics and worthy spatial conflicts, but the game seemed to go on just a bit too long.

Ultimately, it felt like Lowenherz is dominated by a single mechanic.  There are four actions you can do in this game:  build wall(s), get money, put on a knight and/or expand, or take a special effect.  Only three of these are available in each round, and with four players, at least one of them must, therefore, be the subject of a dispute between at least two players solved by either negotiation or blind bidding. This feels fresh at first, but by the end of the game, I found it quite boring and tiresome.  The scoring also felt quite fiddly.  

Bottom line:  a very solid game, but not that much fun. May 2012: 7 of 10.  February 2013: 6 of 10, just no desire to play again.

Lots of cool stuff going on here.  Some very neat systems that interlock quite nicely.  However, there&#039;s definitely a certain meanness in this game, a l=slightly ruthless take-that quality that I don&#039;t mind at in a light card game or something, but it kind of hurts me here.  Which is why I prefer the faster, simpler Domaine, even though this is arguably the &quot;better&quot; game.  Oh, and it really needs the full four players.

Very intense and bloody game.  You always feel like you gotta look at your back and not even the walls are safe.

UPDATE: This is a very good game.  For people like me that do not really like multiplayer wargames, this is one of the very few games that I can play.  It is nice and short and furious and bloody.  This scratches that uneasy "watch your back" feeling game itch.  Marvelous game for this genre of boardgames.  I know that 8 is still pretty harsh for such a good game, but I am just negatively biased against multiplayer direct conflict games.  So, 8 is actually pretty good coming from me.

[b]Deutscher Spiele Preis 1997[/b]

[i]Posted: 10/24/05, Rated: 8[/i]

A game where the seemingly fiddly rules fall into place with unseen elegance.  Very in-your-face confrontational, which is a bit unusual for the stereotypical euro game.  What I'm trying to say is that this is not your typical euro game.

Just about every aspect of the game screams "conflict."  From trying to get dibs on an action, to the fierce negotiation if people try to take the same one, to knight and boundary placement, to region expansion, every action fosters a sense of "I win, you lose."  I love this type of game, but there are friends of mine with whom I cannot play it (minus one point).  It is a brilliant diamond of a gem with four players, and the drop off is steep from there (minus another point).

[i]Löwenherz[/i] is a great game that I will try to play whenever I can get the right people together.  Highly recommended if your group enjoys this much adversity.

[i]Updated: 8/29/10, Rated: 7[/i]

The blush is off the rose for [i]Löwenherz[/i].  It's still a good game, but there not quite in the same echelon as my "8"-rated games.  When I want to get my nasty gaming on, then it will still fit the bill, but my old group of gamers with whom I used to play it have since moved on.  Their willingness to play had inflated my previous rating.

Brutal, early eurogame.  I remember the stress that bidding brought about during play, it was harsh.  lots of sweating, lots of pain.  Fun game, though.  Domaine apparently cleans it up and makes it less confrontational, so I might enjoy playing that one over this one.  I don't know if I will ever play this again.  Too much else out there.

Not my kind of game.  No matter what you do, it's wrong or it helps other players.  Conflict abounds; if you are the easy target, expect to get picked on.  Don't choose the building action every time or else you will create regions for opponents, and you will lag behind in knights; consequently, you will amass a vast territory with few knights (resulting in much land poaching by your warrior-rich opponents).  I recommend trying a blind-bidding method for choosing actions since the game drags when you follow the rules and pick actions in turn order.  ** The module board tiles warp easily (humidity?).

This is a nasty little game! I've gotten to play it 3 and 4 player, and I find it fun both ways. It's a neat twist on area control, and it's very very cut-throat. It's nearly impossible, later in the game, to make a move that doesn't mess with somebody, so there's a lot of conflict.

There is more strategy to the game than I thought, and luck isn't nearly as significant as I worried about. I reccomend Lowenherz, with the caveat that people who like to avoid conflict may not like it.

Deutscher Spiele Preis van dat jaar niet zo’n verkoopsucces. Waarschijnlijk omdat het veel gemener is dan de meeste “families”leuk vinden…

Het werd ook nooit vertaald. Maar wel in 2003 in een compleet bewerkte uitvoering opnieuw uitgebracht (oa in Nederland als Domaine, en in Duitsland weer als Lowenherz) Deze nieuwe versie lijkt me lang niet zo leuk, omdat het bieden op de kaartjes er compleet uit is gehaald. De originele versie van Lowenherz die Rico hier bespreekt vindt je dus helaas alleen 2e hands.

Can't say I've worked out how to play this well, though I have worked out how not to ;-). I love the resource pinch with 4 people bidding on 3 things every turn, and the negotiations that follow, my kind of haggling game really. And it has a nice empire building feel reminiscent of abstract territory marking games like Go. 

I do kind of wish they'd made all the fiddly plastic bits out of wood though and the board frame a little more robust.

A solid area-control game with small amounts of negotiation. I actually preferred the 3 player game over the 4 player game. It virtually never made sense to take the ducat (money) option in a 4 player game.

Compared to Settlers of Catan (both from Klaus Teuber) Löwenherz always wins.

This is one of the better Teuber designs I've played.  The game works well with two, and is VERY competitive.  I wouldn't say there is much backstabbing, but frontstabbing, yes, for sure.  2 out of 3 turns, there is competition for the action card, so the game is guaranteed to stay tense.  The play itself is great - not overly complex, pretty easy to learn, not a huge brain-burn, but plenty of good, deep strategic thinking.  Nice bits, too.  Overall, a very satisfying experience.

I've knocked my rating of this game down just a touch; I used to think of it as an underrated classic, now I think of it as a second-tier game, albeit one that's at more or less the top of the second tier.

Great game!  I like that it is rare that anyone is ever out of the game; one move can sometimes swap first and last place.  Even when it looks like someone is the runaway leader, that person is usually caught within two rounds.  It keeps it interesting for everyone!  I also love the duels for actions.  Oh yeah, and I like backstabbing a lot too, which this game is awesome for.  Far superior to Domaine.

Very pleasant game... The interest is to keep an eye on everything, knowing that you will hardly be able to do everything you want. The end of the game can be very tense since the domains created can be attacked more easily and the moment of the end of the game (the king&#039;s death is one of the last four card) is uncertain! Better with 4 players, less interesting with two!

I like Lowenherz better than Domain. The action selection, negotiation and dueling are a lot of fun...and much more fun that the card drawing that was later sterilized. I like the components for each of the two games just fine, although the color scheme in Lowenherz is more attractive to me.

I also was suprised at how quickly Lowenherz plays. Although there are rules for 3 players, I would only try it with 2 or 4.

I didn't know Teuber had it in him, a real gamer's game with a lot of back and forth action and double dealing aplenty. From the initial setup to the actual gameplay itself, things quickly become confrontational on several fronts at once, and it is nearly impossible to play all parts of the board, so one has to pick their battles carefully. My main knock on this title is first of all, it's a bit on the longer side without being quite what I'm looking for in a heavier title (z.B.: one can plan ahead quite well, but if the wrong card comes up at the wrong time you can be in trouble). Secondly, and more importantly, the game only really starts to get interesting in the second half once some regions are started. Getting there is important (and the basic game setup would have zero charm beyond the first learning game), so there is no way to simply slice off the start of the game, but the problem stands there. Good title though, would be willing to play again.

Very confrontational game, since the only way to score is to grow your territory, and usually the only place to go is into someone else's territory.  You also need to be careful about having a territory that's large but hard to defend -- in the one game I've played, there was a point where our order on the scoring track was exactly reversed from what it had been (and it hadn't been a close game either)

To be fair, it was late, and I was tired when I played this. Now, I will say that I did not enjoy this game. There is too much forced negotiation, which I don't like.

Potential for kingmaking too.

This is one of those brutal games that's so in-your-face competitive that it's impossible to hold a grudge because you're getting screwed so often. Gameplay is oddly abstracted yet very, very tense, as players generally must bribe and outspend each other to get resources before it's too late, but get pounced upon if they pull ahead too early. If we weren't playing with such cute wives, there'd be punches thrown over the table...

This game is very intense and a blast to play. The game is best with 4 players. I love the dueling for the actions and with 4 players the dueling is the most varied. One time we played and there was even a duel for the one wall on what we call the "one wall card". I would have ranked this game higher, but after many, many plays it has worn out on me a little.

In Löwenherz, players are nobles vying for influence in the dying king's realm in order to become his successor on the throne. The most prominent way to do this is to control the largest part of the country, and this makes the game an unusually confrontational game for a euro. It is mostly an area control game with variable areas but you can directly attack other players and take away their land. Don't play with easily offended people!

Each turn players secretly choose one of three available actions. When several players select the same action there will be negotiations or duels. This negotiation aspect can make the game run overly long with the wrong people but I imagine if it becomes excessive an egg timer should fix that.

Depending on the players and their actions, game can take off in vastly different directions. I have played some where all regions were pretty much taken around midgame, and there was lots of fighting back and forth for the rest of the game, and others where at the end of the game, much of the realm was still neutral territory, but the few existing protectorates were armed to the teeth and heavily fortified.

What a nice surprise with how much I liked Lowenherz!  I used to own Domaine, and although I enjoyed it, after a few plays I came to the conclusion that it was a rather dry game and it just never excited me as much as some other games I was playing at the time, so I traded it away. I found Lowenherz at a thrift store and picked it up, somewhat believing that although the two are somewhat similar, there may be core elements in both that I do not enjoy. Well, that was far from the truth! Lowenherz has some of my favourite mechanics: negotiation and bidding. Beyond these two mechanics, there's many subtle, smart ideas sewn throughout the game. It truly is a well thought-out game and its own beast. It's a real nice offering from Klaus Teuber, back when he was trying to create games wholly different from Catan. The area control elements are precisely balanced with the action selection component. This can be a real mean game- brutal at times. But smart players will always be able to capitalize. It's a shame this game has gone discontinued, to be replaced by Domaine, which has since been discontinued as well. It looks like with as much clout as Teuber has, keeping some of his earlier, strong ideas alive isn't in the cards.

I rather liked this game, but there was just one significant problem:  two different groups would not play it a second time.  It seems to appeal only to hardcore strategy gamers, which most of my friends are not.  Players were most turned off by the possibility of being unable to do anything for multiple turns if they happened to choose the same action.  I might rate it higher if I got to play it with a group that really got into it, but it just seems too vicious and too much like work.

I ended up trading it for Starship Catan (which has gotten MANY plays) and bought Domaine.  Domaine has been much more successful in getting repeat plays.  It is still vicious, but players seem to feel like that have more control given the hand management aspect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the more aggressive Euros I have played.  Territories expand and contract, and you have to auction for which action you want to take as well as keep in mind the remaining actions available to  the other players that can hurt you.
Although not as colorful as Domaine, I like that the game looks like an old drawing from the period.  I do wish the boards fit together better.
I will have to try Domaine, although I love the tension-causing auction mechanic.

RATING: 7
Interesting area control game revolving around encircling regions with walls, or by expanding existing territories. The modular grid board is reminiscent of Entdecker, which is another Klaus Teuber design, and definitely a breakaway from his Settlers series of games.

The game is mechanically simple: each turn a card is revealed, showing what three actions are available to the players. Gain gold or a political card, deploy 1/2/3 wall segments, expand 1 or 2 spaces and/or deploy 1 or 2 knights. Each player declares what action they would like to take. However, in a 4 player game, it is possible that two or three of the players will want one of the actions, resulting in a duel, which is just another word for "negotiating" with money.

Each of the three actions are carried out, and thus repeated until the event deck reveals a sudden death "The king is dead" card. Players get VP for encircling cities and mountains (mines), as well as for newly enclosed territories where they have a castle. Knights determine the ability of one territory of one player to expand into another, as well as hold off aggressive expansion. Political cards are significant, as they can give players additional gold, form alliances, and switch affiliations of knights.

Theme-wise, this reminds me of Rhineland, and possibly Feudal. The components are good, and English rules are available. There is some limited German text on the cards, but easily memorizable as to their respective effects.

All in all, a good, seemingly quick game, that could be played in less than 90 minutes, possibly 60 minutes with experienced players. This earlier version of Domaine seems to share the "broken" aspect of the last territories ending up being large. Inexperienced players will seemingly hand over large territories, especially the sides and center, over to other players, based on the eventual layout of the various territories. If this can be overcome, I can see this would be a quick, enjoyable game, with plenty of strategy and tactics. Initial rating is a "7".

Update (01/20/12): I was excited to get a copy of Domaine, which is the English version, but was very disappointed to see the components and game play are somewhat different. The owner of the German version confirmed this, so I am hesitant to break this out and play it.

Update (10/21/13) 2 plays: It's been almost four years since I played this! I finally found a used copy, and finally there was enough interest to bring it to the table. The placement of walls and expansion of territories is very similar to Go. Players "sketch" out future territory with the few walls they can get, while the placement and number of knights prevent incursions from other players. The last territories can indeed be large, unless the players are cognizant of such possibilities, and vigilant (with enough gold) to prevent one player from closing off a complete territory. I've seen the same phenomena happen in Go, where White unexpectedly wound up with considerable area in the center of the board, since Black (a beginner, that's me) was too busy fighting for the corners and edges. The "dueling" or bidding for conflicted actions is important. Bid too little and the opponent will walk all over you. Bid too much and the same opponent will walk all over you, later. It seems there is some fragility in that regard, similar to Chicago Express, since money is the only defense. Individual actions are not game-breaking in the beginning, but near the end can be worth much, much more. This plays somewhat like a wargame, with fronts, but is substantially tempered down to feel like a Euro. Still holding at a "7", with room to go up with more plays.

As a direct confrontation game this is a rarity in Euro land. The action cards get a tad monotonous over the 90 minute playing time and it's a shame that the negotiation phase is so unimaginative (why can't something other than money be offered?). Still, there's plenty of interest and a variety of strategies to pursue.

Gioco di occupazione territoriale, strategico e molto interattivo, con un meccanismo d’asta non privo di un’interessante componente psicologica. E’ importante costruire la propria partita pian piano, nell’ombra, per sfuggire alle coalizioni avverse. Basilari, concentrazione e attenzione: ogni errore si paga, ma – a differenza di altri giochi – ogni buona mossa rende. DA NON CONFONDERE CON DOMAINE, RIVISITAZIONE DEL GIOCO, DELLO STESSO TEUBER.

First played Oct 9th, 2007. This can be taught in about 15 minutes and takes about 1.5 hours to play for 4 players. Each player is a prince(s) who is trying to gain the most victory points. To do this you mush obtain land (place or move walls around your castles), gold mines, special cards. You start with three castles (one having surrounding walls) a knight, and money. On a players turn, there are 3 cards for the 4 players to choose from. Cards have: Place Knight, Place/move Walls, Draw card, recieve gold. All players could pick the same card and negotiate (bidding) who gets the action (paying off the other). If they can't agree then the offer up gold secertly. If there is a tie, you bid again. A 2nd tie, no one gets the action. If gold is chosen, players would split it. Special cards include: treasure(gold), renegate(switch knight side), alliance, and victory points. I'd strongly recommend giving this a gameplay if you know someone who has it. It's out of print so you may not find it for purchase, however it's worth a look.

I'd rather play Chess with dice than give this mess another try.  Lowenherz isn't broken per se but it is heavily flawed as a game design.  Everything is zero sum, the actions vary wildly in value, point scoring is stupidly wacky, and the whole core boundary idea, while neat, is totally abusable.  I see where they were going with this one but they missed the mark by a good mile.  Plus, the whole dueling by blind bidding thing is so not dueling (it annoys me a lot for some reason).  I'm sure the game is salvagable given the right amount of work and effort, but I'd rather move on to the more elegant area control games instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent game - definitely in the depth category where it takes a play or two to grasp the strategy.  And it's challenging to play with a lead in this game, as other players can bring you back to the pack.

The game's blend of mechanics - Euro-style resource limitations combined with conflict between the players - puts it in its own genre of game within my collection.  i.e., it's very unique.

This is a very approachable area control game with some negotiation and also a silent auction mechanic (aka blind bidding). They all work very well together and strategy and tactics are both in good proportions as well. 4 would be best to play, then 3 and 2 was okay. 

I'm going to try playing an active "dummy" rather than a passive one suggested in the rules which should make it even more interesting by sharing control of the dummy. 

A good strategy game with low luck that should play in about 90 minutes

A runaway leader problem makes this game almost unplayable... when one player gets a majority in knights, it is almost impossible to stop him.  It usually takes all three of the other players to stop the leader and when have you ever seen three players co-operate in a four player game?  Not at our club... you'd be lucky to convince two.  The updated second edition streamlines a lot of rules and makes the game superior in all respects. (see listing under Domaine)

[2008.Jul.2] Three aspects of this game were a surprising disappointment to me, considering that I enjoy playing the redeveloped version of this game: [gameid=5737]. First, the negotiation mechanism adds little to the fun of playing the game, while at the same time adding to the overall length of the game. Second, some of the action cards become stale in the late game--especially, those action cards with two wall placing actions. (In 4-player games, this translates to one player taking an action while the others watch.) Finally, I was perplexed by the division of the political cards into two separate draw decks (with randomly chosen cards in each). In my opinion, this adds a luck factor that serves no purpose other than to thwart players who choose the pile containing political actions they don't need as much. Although, I am glad that I had an opportunity to play this game, I would rather play [i]Domaine[/i]. Give it a try and see what you think.

RATING: 4
An old fashioned game with only one strategy to win. Run away leader effect. Old fashioned graphics, not upto modern standards. What you need to do: 
1. get yourself an area in a corner
2. build knights and expand. 
3. repeat nr. 2
Quite boring. No need to, not even wise to go for multiple castle-areas. Domaine is the better version. It has an alternative winning strategy based on points, which keeps building fences interesting in the late game to. Here it is not. One-sided game.

Interesting variant on Domaine (or vice versa) which uses the Basari mechanic of having players select an action of three, and then have to go through a conflict resolution phase if they end up selecting the same one.  The prediction mechanic is interesting here, but I am rather frustrated with symetrical games of this type, where unlike Basari, (and B also goes a bit too far in this direction), most actions end up being equivalently good (or bad) for most players, so the real question is whether you're willing to take the "good" action (and risk losing out big if too many other players select the same one) or lowball by taking one of the "bad" actions (and still risk losing out if other people do the same thing, but maybe do OK if everyone else takes the high road).  Note that "Hook or By Crook" (Adel Verplecht?) has similar problems, but more choices that make it a little less frustrating.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this more each time I play it.. should get more attention.  Component quality (specifically, the game board) a bit shaky.  Can be vicious; don't play if you're the type to hold a grudge after someone double-crosses you in a game.  Edit: spilled Dr Pepper on this in 2014.  I don't think I have the patience to try to salvage a pile of sticky, warped game tiles.  Farewell Lowenherz.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nasty game where players are trying to eke out territory by surrounding area with walls.  There are a number of actions available and when two players vie for the same action they compete in a bidding war.  You can also take over other people's territories, if I remember correct they are defended by knights so I think your attacking territory needs more knights than the defending territory.  There are tough decisions to make between adding more defense to your kingdom or growing your kingdom (VPs).

Basically agree completely with CortexBomb's comments. Lowenherz is an interesting game that lasts about twice as long as it should. Without much of an arc, it would be a decent 45 to 60 minute game, but at the 90 minute listed time (or longer with players who wish to contemplate every move), there is just not enough here. I tend to like these area influence games, especially those with other stuff going on, so I do prefer this to many other run-of-the-mill Euros.

The player who introduced me to this one is fanatical about it, and I've enjoyed the two plays of the game that I've had.  I'd be lying if I said that they weren't both tension-filled.  However, there is a lot of interaction in the game (I find that while there's a little bit of tactical it's mostly negotiation) and I find such games too demanding to play often (Diplomacy being the other one with which I'm familiar).

Three-player has some interesting differences from four-player.  The double action afforded to one of the players each turn requires some hard decisions.

Place knights, place walls, move walls or draw cards to expand your various kingdoms. Simultaneous choosing of actions and if more than two people choose it, an auction takes place. A game that we don't play enough. Lots of competition for walls, knights or cards. Have not played the updated version (Domaine) which apparently takes out the bidding system and makes it cleaner.

First game only - to be revised (3 players). Non-intuitive at first especially on worth of politics cards and monitary worth of actions but strategy clearer by end-game. Smells like a "keeper".

Finally I played with 4-player using variable set-up. It is so much better than "suggested starting position for beginners" as we all build walls around.

Area control that uses niffty mechanic to allow players to see what others are interested in and then allow them to select the same action forcing a buyoff or bid war.

Based on one play: As apposed to what I have heard, the game play is quite different from Domaine. more battles with opponents, since you have to fight with the others for your actions. Money is a pain, since you do not buy and sell cards, you simply chose the action to receive money, however, you need to time it so that others do not take half your cash (or more). Lots of fun and like in Domaine, you won't be making friends with this game.

OWN Dec/04: Just bought this, hugely discounted.  Aug/05: Still unplayed.

TRY Oct/05: This is one vicious, delicious battle!  But it does take awhile to sort out how everything fits together, and what value to attach to actions for the bidding wars.  Our 3er also went well past the 90 min mark, but I could see 90 min with knowledgeable players.  3er scores: 54, 52, 51!

Very good game, but the length of play & explanation will make it difficult to see loads of table time.

After the first plays, I liked it ok but wasn't amazed and it had a lot of dificulties in hitting the table. Recently we decided to give it another chance (we were four, and that's the magic number to play this) and I was surprised with the amount of enjoyment we got from it. Very clever game...and a nasty one too! Still there was a lot of competition for this to hit the table often, so I sold it.

I reduced my rating since it really boils down to the people you're playing with. You get a jerkoff who won't take any negotiation other than "all your money or go to blind auction" and the game gets old fast.

RATING: 6.5
Lowenherz was my first real taste of a proper 'area of control' game, made visible at the setup: walls encircle properties which each contain a castle and some knights.  Players choose an action from a radomly drawn card that offers 3 choices, and if 2 players choose the same action they battle it out.  Needless to say, there's some trouncing going on.  With this game, you'll want to play with people who like conflict and direct competition.  That said, it is a great title and a good one for the collection, especially if you can find it cheap on Ebay.

When do I play this?:
Best played with my buddies with beer.. but that's just me.

Update -- I used to own two copies of this, but traded them both away.  Surprised to see how the price has changed,-- I bought my copies for 7 bucks /ea

1 play - 60-90 minutes (5 player)

Much more cut-throat than Domaine. Has the same "the game is over already - that was too fast" feeling. Both share the rich wall building interelationships and the 'ahah' when you've either failed to close in any domaines or closed them all in to discover how limiting that is. The score keeping was just plain busted. We ignored keeping the point score for regions on the fly and only tracked the silver (mountain) scoring until the end of the game. This easily clipped off 30 minutes of useless play time. Will definately play again.

E’ importante costruire la propria partita pian piano, nell’ombra, per sfuggire alle coalizioni avverse.

This is one of those "tying up marbles with string" games, where you have too much to do and not enough actions/resources to do it with. It also adds the auction dynamic where you must contend with other players for the actions you need. A great design.

It's my strong belief that Löwenherz is Klaus Teuber's underappreciated masterpiece. The bidding for actions remains the salt and pepper of this elegant area-control boardgame (which, as a matter of fact, offers very few surprises from, say, special cards and such -- and I consider that a good thing). Forget about the sucessor game Domaine, this is the one to go for.

A near-perfect output by Klaus Teuber. I love the novel bidding mechanic that contains elements of second-guessing and negotiation (The removal of this is the reason why I think Domaine is a lesser game). This game exudes confrontation, as it can be down right brutal. So... check your feelings at the door. 

Components are great, and the artwork has this whimsical colored pencil look that is immersive and functional (minus the one gray city that blends into the background). Strategically, this game is very dense, and any bad decisions become apparent during the final score tally (although, you'll probably be aware of it the turn after you made it). Vintage Teuber of the old school mind set: less is more.

Probably not the good first step for somebody who hasn't played Domaine, as players are basically asked to appraise the value of nearly every single action in the game. The game feels more well-balanced than Domaine, with more interesting decisions and control of what you want to do, and a more refined scoring system. But it's a little too complex for its own good when compared to Domaine's elegant simplicity.

Parts of the game were off in my first play, but I'll chalk it up to it being 3-player, with one player doing horribly (causing me and the 3rd player to rarely interact). This appears to play best with, and only with, 4.

-------------------

Got rid of this game, because the optimal number of 4 players and play time of 2 hours is just too tough to obtain consistently. And I'd rather play Domaine. I appreciate the use of negotiations in determining the value of the actions, and the stratification of actions into two types (the political deck and the wall-placers + expanders + nights) but those negotiations can really bog the game down, especially with inexperienced players involved.

[3 plays] This is a gamer's game. The reimplemented version (Domaine) is still a good game, but doesn't have the richness of decisions and the epic power swings bidding for money and movement.

Löwenherz is a game of timing, knowing where to pick your battles, and avoiding making enemies. You need to develop one duchy very quickly in a corner where you can hopefully start generating an income quickly. Place another castle towards the center, but allow others to build most of your walls for you before you invest efforts with that location.

This is a game that could really shine with frequent play by a regular group. I'm glad to own this beauty. Easily teachable, but delicious depth. A good game needs strategy in initial placement, good tactics as things evolve, diplomacy, careful bidding, and shrewd analysis of your opponents' likely intentions.

RATING: 3
Lowenherz has problems.  The map system is nice, but even in the improved Domaine you must spend your energies to constantly keep people in check.  The big problem with Lowenherz is that the bidding system perpetuates forced actions with little control.  The random factor of having only a few different kinds of actions available is compounded by the chaos of not knowing when people are going to bid against you.  This system is just downright irritating as you can end up going several turns without doing anything on the board.  This would be fine if the bidding phase were engaging, but it comes down to chaotic arbitrary bids, or blind bidding.

Even then if this were a shorter game or a lighter game it would be ok, but there is just no excuse for lost turns in a game of this depth.  Heart of Africa is only one game I know of that succeeds at this and that is because everyone loses their turn but the winner.  Here you may spend turn after turn collecting money, sometimes splitting it, when another player with one wild extortion or a bid for big cash that no one bids on can garner 4 turns worth of cash. The wild swings in  value make this irritating.

When last I played I won the game through NO proper decisions of my own, while I watched the people around me play better without anything to show for it. I'm guessing that the game was intended to be OVERLY long in order for people to catch a runaway leader, but if it were shorter you wouldn't notice the runaway leader problem.

I'll stick with my copy of Domaine.

Fun with a group that doesn't demand instant gratification and that enjoys an aggressive style of play. The main problem is approachability: it's not an easy game to explain, and you have to play a few times to get any notion of strategy. But with familiarity the action moves along briskly, and there's good interaction.

Quality area-control game.  I like the medieval theme, and how the areas change over time.  There's an auction element here which also adds to fun player interaction, especially the part where there is a duel when two players tie.  This might even need to be bumped up to a 9.

UPDATE: After three plays now, I have to move this to a 9.  It's simply so enjoyable between the great bits, fun and interactive gameplay that I don't even mind finishing last.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an interesting game, but there's likely to be too much conflict for many people: with only 3 actions and 4 players, someone will be left out (although they may be able to negotiate something, of course). Also, the board is small enough that castles and knights are in close proximity -- it's not long before you are expanding into someone else's region, or building walls to hem them in while you create a large region for yourself. Since some actions allow you to both add a knight and expand, you're never sure that you can trust your neighbors even if you have reached arms parity ... so there's a natural tendency to an arms race where knights get built up and up! Another potential problem is game speed: since players reveal their Decision Cards in turn, everyone has to think about their choice in turn. It might be faster if everyone chose and revealed simultaneously; but that would take away a lot of the tension in the game, too.

I think this would be a great game for the right crowd (duh!). But for our group, it probably has too much down time; and it definitely has too much direct, in-your-face (for a eurogame, anyway) conflict.

RATING: 7
[Goldsieber 'Löwenherz' 1997 edition] {Medieval Kingdom; bidding, area-control, modular board, utility cards; optimal 4p} Löwenherz is a nice area control game. It is thematic and intuitive; thus, it's not difficult to learn and master. It's confrontational because players have to compete for everything - actions, land, gold, and score and one can intrude territories of other players. The action system and "duel" system is unique, which can't be found in other games. Players have to continually make tough decisions. It's not a good 3p game because a pair of players can easily block out the remaining poor player. (actually, most 3p games have the same problem)

Players have to use the politics card wisely. Those cards give a player the chance to backstab his opponents; without those cards, players can't attack much because all information is open. 

Löwenherz has unique game bits but the quality of the board is quite disappointing. I especially like those knights!

Engrossing game with auctions and quasi-battles that had gateway appeal even before the advent of Domaine.  I much prefer the mechanics of this original version, as well as the components.  What some find drab, I find to be a fine evocation of the medieval period.  To me, it's Domaine that falls short aesthetically, with its garish and modern color scheme.  Great game, pretty comparable to Knizia at his best.

This assessment is only after one play, but I liked the game. We played with 3 players, but the game seems to be tailored for 4 (although it wasn’t bad with three). This is because of the card/play/bid mechanism for each turn’s actions. With three actions to be taken each turn – in a 3-player game it’s too easy for everyone to “get along” and pick one of each instead of conflicting over one action in a turn. Each player needs to play fairly aggressively as well. I have a feeling that this rating might go up with further play (with the right people).  I've edited this up as I've played this more.  Great competition with four players.

Finally played this after 17 (logged) plays of Domaine.  I really like the tension of the Power Trials and imagine there is some nice opportunity for clever play with money.    Without overly drawing out the Power Trials, it still seemed like they added a lot of time to the game.  I also miss the card play of Domaine, so I'm leaning toward keeping it and trading Löwenherz.

While Lowenherz is a somewhat interesting game, the back-and-forth struggle of expanding regions into each other gets old after a while -- UPDATE: Raised from a 6 to a 7.  I finally tried this game with 4 players, and it is much better with 4 players than with just 2 players.  The conflict for actions and board space is definitely much more interesting with more people involved.

I believe this game is TREMENDOUSLY underrated. It has one of the most intriguing gameplays I have seen. Games can shift with one single last move. I have seen players move from first to last and vice versa on the last play of the game due to careful planning. Amazing. Get it if you can.

One of the most puzzlingly overrated games on the 'Geek.  The auction mechanic is unique and somewhat interesting, but the game is dryyyyyy.  Pushing your walls to increase your domain never really appealed to me.  If you have knights, use them for more than this passive-aggressive "I'll keep them in my land and use it to make this line that says what is mine move."  Have the knights fight or something, c'mon!  Also, what's the deal with this rigid land borders in a medieval society?  Solidified borders of this nature are a much newer invention.  It was too difficult to establish borders of this nature with the lower population densities of medieval times.  Just another nail in the themeless coffin for this game.

The king lies near death, so the princes compete to dominate the kingdom and secure the throne by grabbing as much land as possible. Each turn a card displays three actions that players can choose from - build a wall, move a wall (expanding your kingdom), place a knight, etc. When more than one player chooses the same action, however, a bidding war takes place. All kinds of bits come in this package -- walls, castles, knights and a gorgeous game board that allows for variable setups.

Selection of decisions feel rather hollow as players would prefer to avoid selecting the same decision as other players and having to go through the negotiation and bidding processes. The negotiation and bidding mechanics are strange and lengthens the game needlessly. Player interaction therefore feel forced. There seem to be too few wall building options and players may not even complete their areas when the game ends, which suggests a lack of playtesting. The deduction of points when one's land is reduced also encourages defensive play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game of cordoning off areas and trying to expand into other players' territories. The action card system takes a few rounds to get accustomed to, but once you are familiar with the rules, the game plays quickly and offers some good strategy and gameplay. By nature of the rectangular board, the game is almost specifically and only built for four players -- it's a bit odd and unwieldy with three.

Another great, playable game from Simonitch--second only to Ardennes 44 and a bit above Normandy 44 for me.  A little tricky, though, in that the system looks and feels much like those other games, but there are a number of differences in the rules.  Highly immersive and enjoyable.  Very, very tough for the Brits to get to Arnhem.

I’ve got a few sessions in on this now, and I’m still not quite sure what to make of it. It’s still the totally professional design job you get from Mark Simonitch, really slick and appealing, But the Market Garden situation is just so problematic to game. The lone rode that XXX Corps drives down is a traffic control headache, which is not super-fun to either game or to wait for your opppnent to game. There are tricks to the game, especially for the Airborne units, that if you miss you’ll get kinda hammered. And the interest for the Germans develops only as the game goes on; the first couple days they don’t do a whole lot outside of the 1st Airborne operational area. They get pretty interesting when you get into day 3 or 4, but at that point you kinda know how the game is going to work out and I don’t knomw that it still has that much interest in it.

Now, having said all that, there is a bunch of cool stuff going on here. I like how the vagaries of the drop and the bridgeemolition forces a bunch of variability into the game, and gives both sides some interesting variations each game while generally keeping the game sensibly on track. I like that the Allies have a few options in getting across the Rhine, if the 1st Airborne can hold a perimeter somewhere - it’s not just Arnhem or bust. I like the real choices you have with all 3 Airborne divisions. I like that the flanks of XXX Corps have some interesting stuff going on. I like the generally clean and slick game system, although it’s a little chromey here compared to other games in the series.

My suggestions for playing: stick to the 11 turn scenario. Solitaire the Allies once before playing them to iron out so of their trickier tactical issues. Unlike the other games in this series, this actually might be best tackled by 3 or maybe 4 players - one XXX Corps, one Airborne, one German Arnhem/Nijmegen, one German for Veghel/Eindhoven. Also just one German player might be fine, they don’t have a ton going on for a while. The Allied situation is difficult really just because of the constant task switching; the individual mini-battles are pretty coherent, but dealing with 3-4 of them - each quite different - can be mentally taxing.

Anyway, I’ve been quite enjoying it, but Ukraine ‘43 and France ‘40 strike me as the more playable, interesting games with better bang for the time & rules investment. Market-Garden has an undeniable appeal, and this (along with Monty’s Gamble: Market Garden) are probably the best games done on it to date. But man, it’s a tough topic, especially to do in a fairly traditional way like this.

Surprisingly chromy game. I like Simonitch's operational games, but there is something about them that feels scripted. I suppose that is a good thing; they encourage historical play. But it feels a bit of a straightjacket. That said, my first play has been a very enjoyable experience with the airborne forces working hard to hold the bridges, clear Arnhem and Nijmegen, and link up with the XXX Corps. Meanwhile, the Germans do their best to throw up roadblocks until the reinforcements arrive. The victory conditions are ROUGH for the allies, so what feels pretty lopsided is in fact pretty balanced.

RATING: 2
Market-Garden operation, designed in famous ZOC-Bond series. Overall there is lot to like - well written rules, easy to read map and counters design. 
But, game have serious flaws in playability and balance. Design intent was to "help" Allied side with more units in play, giving them units, which doesn't race to Arnhem (VIII Corps, especially with his 11th Armored Division) and in the same time, giving nothing to German side. Effect is overwhelming, because German units, which historically fight against XXX Corps are worn in combat with VIII Corps. In addition, map is too wide to give Germans real chance to cut off corridor to Arnhem, because of too few units they have at their disposal.
Second thing are overpowered airborne units, which have too much staying power, especially against weak Germans units in Arnhem and Nijmegen area. Game did not show granularity and lethality of those units, which soaks off ammo and supplies of Allied paratroopers with constant pressure. Historical dilemmas about getting to Nijmegen or staying in Groesbeek Heights and in Arnhem (race to the bridge or secure LZ's) are not present.
Third thing is, that hidden units option didn't work, because it's too random and it is more helpful option for Allied than German side. 
All those flaws are strengthened by flawed victory conditions, which in extreme situations leads to odd situations, where Allied don't need Arnhem bridges, but only to survive by British airborne on northern side of Lower Rhine, because VP's for Cities completely solves victory problem to Allied favor. Germans are struggling to hunt for airborne units VP, which is difficult task, given superhuman staying power of paratroopers, even in OOS conditions.
Given game too long for my tastes playing time, it's easy to predict its ending after 8-9 turns, sometimes even after initial and 2nd wave landings and bridge blown pattern. Probably shorter game (11 turn scenario) is better choice, but game as such, is rather dissapointing experience.

Easy to learn and elegant game system. It allows for a good flowing fun game. The Airdrops crearte a slightly different starting situation that increases replayability. The players can concentrate on the few vital decisions they need to make. The FOW is elegantly incorporated by the German "?" units. I think this game is excellent for solo gaming.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
While Holland '44 has much in common with Normandy '44 and Ardennes '44, this iteration of the rules seems even more elegant and highly evolved.  The system makes good use of ZOC bonds to keep the unit count down while still keeping a fine enough grid to capture the tactically important terrain.  The terrain really matters, as do combined arms tactics, and the two are tightly intertwined.  Both the situation and the system remind me a lot of another favorite, von Borres' Roads to Leningrad.

The glossy rule book is clear and concludes with an extensive and heavily illustrated example of play.  The materials are the usual high GMT standard with a decent setup card (the companion reinforcement care is downloadble from BGG), standard NATO pieces with color-coded formation information, and solid card-stock player aid cards.  The map is pretty standard stuff, both in material and artwork.

Overall, the best Market Garden I've tried yet, and certainly the best I've seen that can be played out in one sitting.

Another excellent game in the "'44" series that tackles Operation Market Garden.  As with other games in the series, everything, from the maps to the charts to the rules, has been thought out carefully to ease things for the gamer.  The game play is fast and furious, with many decisions that need to be made each turn for both sides, so the game has very good replay value, especially with the unknown units and weather.  My only complaint and this is with most Market Garden games, is that a lot hinges on the British 1st Airborne seizing the Arnhem bridge and holding it for a few turns.  If that fails it might be time to restart the game.

This one is rapidly climbing on my list! A very good design, great components (as usual from GMT) and a very beautiful game. Honestly, I don’t know much of the historical battle but that’s not stopping me from being fascinated and blown away by the game, it really captures me and is very addictive.

Really great Mark Simonitch design.  

Market-Garden is a complex situation, and in this treatment (closer to Ardennes '44 in rules and scale, closer to Normandy '44 in number of units) all the mechanisms fit perfectly.  As usual with this system, the foundations are solid and the chrome is wonderfully flavorful without being fiddly or overdone.

This is another Mark Simonitch operational wargame in the same vein as [b]Ardennes '44[/b]. As for ZOC bonds, I've learnt to live with them and not judge a game for them. They're just another quirk of zones of control in general, albeit the quirkiest. A wargame on Operation Market Garden should've been incredibly awesome, but there are many reasons this game is a let down.

This game has a lot of design flaws. Airborne supply units respawn when they're destroyed and provide limited supply trace for airborne units, so it's basically impossible to actually put airborne units out of supply. Shockingly, isolation attrition is an optional rule; although the campaign only covers seven days of game time. The supply rules are incredibly forgiving, allowing trace across four hexes of any type of terrain hex, then along the road net of unlimited length. Being out of supply only affects your attack strength, not your defence strength. I recall the rather famous video footage of a member of 1st Para throwing a brick at a German soldier in Arnhem after he had run out of ammunition.

As a shining exception, the traffic markers, a mechanism borrowed from Simonitch's earlier game [b]France '40[/b], is an incredibly elegant way of representing congestion along the main avenues of advance. These serves as the primary means for the German player to defend. Confusingly, dismounting mechanised units have no effect beyond reducing their movement allowance by two, despite the fact they've left the majority of their firepower on the other side of the river.

There are several ways in which the game is scripted for an Allied victory. German reinforcements can't move between certain entry areas (e.g. C to D), which means the Germans will never be able to get enough defensive strength to reinforce Nijmegen or Arnhem. Supply attrition is virtually impossible to achieve, so cutting off units won't achieve much. Bridges can be automatically repaired without the use of a bridge engineer, so long as there are no enemy units within 4 hexes.

German units are not allowed to use multiple artillery shifts in the same combat. Overstacking is basically a non-issue unless you're defending, so the traffic jams along the highway are signficantly eased. The ferry rules are also incredibly generous. The three most important bridges in the game are indestructible; there are no circumstances they can attempt to be blown. Crucially, the raised roads and highways in the area are not modelled, whereas historically armoured columns had significant difficulties advancing due to being exposed to anti-tank gun fire.

There are also rules that seem to have been included for little reason, since their circumstances rarely occur. The requirements to infiltration is so onerous they're basically never fulfilled. The additional movement cost in woods for leg units after two hexes is similarly never seen, given the lack of wood hexes three or more in a row and pointing in the direction of avenues of advance. Engaged is a combat result that occurs quite commonly and is always a letdown for the attacker, doing nothing most of the time.

Lastly, though probably accurate as to the status of German units in what was before the launch of Operation Market Garden considered a quiet sector, it is disappointing as a player to see all German armoured battalions as 1 step units, whereas all Allied armour units are 3 step units. Basically, this is a fantasy ahistorical version of Market Garden where the Allied steamroller can't be stopped.

Be aware that this is quite a complex design - there are a lot of little rules to remember. Fortunately the unit count isn't enormous, so the game appears to be quite playable (it actually is).

One of the most compelling battles of WWII, if anyone can pull it off it's Mark Simonitch. And he has - this is a *fantastic* game! It really captures the situation better than any other Market-Garden game I've ever played. Bravo!

(p.s., would love to see an Arnhem mini-scenario in C3i).

RATING: 10
Brilliant. The ZOC bonds themselves are worth an essay, the map and terrain issues exquisite, and Simonich is iconic for good reason. I had extraordinary experience with the game narrative & absorbing his unique mechanics and applying them across the moving focal points of the unravelling situation.

You will see some criticism in the commentaries having to do with things like artillery constraints or traversing the woods that seem like rule misreadings. 

As someone who loves uncertainty & chit-pull tempo stuff in wargames, it's worth saying that Simonich's point of view is more in the classic 'god's eye, UGO-IGO' end of things. His innovations, such as the chess-like ZOC bonds and the dramatic uncertainties of things like the determined defense mechanic, create a constant flow of pressing, lovely, and uncluttered tactical problems to pros ecute an strategy. His sense of scale is also uncanny, it all fits together in an aesthetic that finds that line between complexity, unit density, historicity and being very seeable & playable. There is a satisfying maturity & coherence in the system he's evolved.

Lovely solo. I think this is the one where I (finally) fully absorbed a Simonich ruleset and got creatively engaged at a high level. A personal classic for me, and now I can turn back to Normandy & also move forward to play his Ardennes.

Shortly after it was published, there was a burst of hysteria in some forums on the issue of balance. There's some intricacy in the rules & map in how to prosecute advances that took me a couple of plays, so keep your mind open as it takes some (fun) work to get this game down and be careful of hasty conclusions that may be more a social media lemming cliff plunge rather than the early experiential query of a new game. I'll leave here a response I made in a forum on balance & early strategy should it be relevent to you:

*

I've played four times & twice the allies have won. In the successes, they've been rather aggressive on all fronts (except those hunkering down in Arnhem) and didn't cross the Rhine at Arnhem but crossed west. If you haven't taken this approach, I'd note you'll want to study the map to see how to get supply across the island in four hexes and plan your crossings carefully (i.e.: the landings need to be between Rhenen and Wageningen, else units make it but get stranded OOS... don't expect too much help from Arnhem). I think they both ended on either side of turn 16, so it took awhile. And I didn't care that the Poles couldn't land in the north, I needed them on the island anyway, and they screened the right flank for crossings to the west. Ie: I became less obsessed with protecting every landing zone, everyone got down somewhere. In these games, I'll note I always held Graves on the opening, and took risks jumping the Bocholt-Herentals Canal across the front (not just the Highway) on the opening that were successful (I threw opening artillery/planes across the front).

On one opening, the bridge at Son was saved. The other, I had a convoluted route through Lieshout/Beek (iirc) that was a bugger.

It's off the table at the moment, but will come back out again because the bridge/landings and the randomized 406th openings creates different problems & different games. And also, once I'd worked through an effective Allied strategy I realized I had work to do on the German side. My current German problem: even though I adapted to set up a picket across the Waal, there was too much pressure all over the map & there was no way to strengthen things enough to prevent a breakthrough with leading Allied paratroopers & once they crossed everything caved. So in my last two games I struggled (as Germany) with what to send against Arnhem and what to scoot south to hold the island, and where to concentrate them there.  In short, all over the map I can't seem to get sufficient German resistence concentrated in a way to seriously threaten the highway (Allied traffic problems has been their main problem).

Funny, yes? I tuned in to this forum seeking help playing the German side at my stage in things and hear anxiety about it being impossible to win as the Germans from some first plays. Because my Germans don't just struggle the north, I haven't been able (as the Germans) to hold the Zuid-Willems Canal in the Helmut area before the 107th Panzer brigade entered & so they got sucked into that mess and chewed up. Twice! And never got deep into things to threaten supply.

Just thought I should leave this note to address the man who said every AAR says the Germans always win. So please count two allied wins. Though I can't speak too strongly to balance issues after only four plays into what is a game of some complexity & a tricky map.

Well, except to mention if you go for a game on Market-Garden, how can it be about balance? What would it mean to make it easy to take the Rhine, except to subvert the lesson & human loss of that whole debacle?

A masterful addition to the myriad of games on this campaign.  A bit of a twist on supply rules that highlight Hell's Highway and its precarious position as the primary ground (re)supply route of the operation.

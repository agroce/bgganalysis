RATING: 8.5
A very fun filler from the apparent king of filler games Steve Finn. This game uses dice in a fairly standard yahtzee style mechanism as you roll the dice trying to make pairs, threes of a kind, etc. in order to move up a track to score a planet, collect cards to get special abilities or mine for mines. But some of the dice rolled each time will cause planets to get hit my meteors which can cause a planet to be destroyed and scored before anyone can make any progress. So you are constantly trying to balance your plays along each of the 5 planets as you vie for acsendancy along each of their score track. A fun dice chucking filler.

I  am mostly a solo gamer, this game hits the sweet spot of complexity versus time.  Nice use of push-your-luck, with interesting decisions to make each turn or roll.  Not too long that it wears out it's welcome.  I've found the rules to be very well written with few ambiguities.   Very nice game that will stay in my collection.

solo javascript - late June '15

solo game gets same-y after awhile. maybe i'll re-open this project and add other planets (eg 3/4/5/6-in-a-row), or even basic computer opponents. seems like you should always roll 6 dice if possible, so maybe that should cost 3vp instead of 2. raising the vp rewards on the harder planets might also tempt me out of the usual low-first, high-last routine.

My wife and I are really enjoying this great little game. It plays fast, has some fun interesting decisions, and a nice amount of luck for its length. There are many ways to push your luck and manipulate your dice. It is fast to set up and low on rules overhead. A great game that I'm very happy to have in my collection! We also have tried the coop variant and it is fun and challenging as well. A great, fun design!

RATING: 8
Cosmic Run is one of those rare gems that is both accessible as a gateway game and enjoyable enjoyable to be a filler for more experience gamers. Leaning heavily on a dice-chucking mechanic, CR puts you in the driver seat of a fleet of space ships racing to colonize planets before meteors pulverize them into space dust. Along the way players can purchase support cards (various alien races with special abilities) and increase their "good deals" on an individual player "bonus track".

What gives CR a leg up from "okay" to "NEAT!" is the looming threat of obliteration. At the beginning of each player's turn, dice are rolled to see if a mega-meteor is, in fact, inbound and, if so, which planet gets whacked. Planets get two thumpings before they are wiped from existence, so players have to decide whether or not they're close enough to "win" that planet or if they need to cut their losses and focus effort elsewhere. And few things are as satisfying as colonizing a planet that has two strikes against it. It's equally crushing to be one turn away from winning that planet, only to have it "Alderaaned" before your very eyes. 

Another great mechanic is what my game group calls the "punishment for inactivity" aspect. Ships begin with negative points on planet track, so you're forced to move ships to avoid taking a major hit. There can be some tough decisions along the way, too. Do I move ahead of the Blue Player on this planet, or get out of the negative points on this OTHER planet?

Overall, Cosmic Run is a wonderful filler game that will appeal to non-gamers as much as regulars looking for a fun 20 minutes. With a fast pace of play and some wonderful thematic aspects (like seeing a planet blown to pieces) it has a permanent place on our gaming shelf.

Yahtzee wasn't enough game, Can't Stop wasn't enough game; Cosmic Run fits in a nice bracket where you want a bit of dice rolling, luck and dice allocation but you also want choices and luck mitigation.  A very tight and fun game.

Cosmic Run is a push-your-luck dice game from Dr. Finn, with his son Seamus, set in outer space with some literal races to explore 5 planets in a system plagued with deadly meteors.

Players start the turn determining if another meteor strike has occurred on one of the planets, then use a Yahtzee mechanism to lock rolls towards certain goals.

Aliens can be acquired with rolls, which allow a limited number of roll modifications, unusable dice values can also be used to advance bonuses on a player technology track.

Progress towards planets, alien sets, and crystal mining (available thru Tech or Aliens) all contribute to VP's earned- when game end is triggered the player with the most VP's wins.

This is a less directly competitive push-your-luck than Capo Dei Capi, and it follows more standard dice application rules, which make it a more 'family-friendly' game.

One of our favorites from Dr. Finn! Cosmic Run is an enjoyable dice game full of agonizing decisions.  The tension really builds as the game comes to a conclusion - and even when the dice don't fall in your favor, there are enough mitigating factors and alternatives to keep us from getting frustrated.  This is another great "filler" game from Dr. Finn.

Dr. Finn game in which you use combinations of the six dice to get victory points in a number of ways: cards, status and gems. However, the dice can also blow up planets, and some planets are hard to get ahead on.

PLUS: easy to learn, good combination of luck and hope
MINUS: a starter game but not much more (2-3 games and you're done)

A decent dice allocation game that's fairly light.  There's some excitement in the race to the planets.  But it doesn't really add anything new to the genre, and if you already have a game that fulfills your space race or dice allocation needs, this might not be necessary for your collection.

[b]Cosmic Run[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I played a four player game of Cosmic Run and it me of a more streamlined version of Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game with the auction mechanic removed and solely focused on moving up different scoring tracks. I found the decisions to be almost too simple, most of the time you roll the dice and put them where they'll match up without much thought. The alien cards offer more interesting choices since they allow you to manipulate the dice. However; there is also a set collection mechanic tacked onto the alien cards which I really didn't care for since you had to focus on the color of aliens you got and not just the powers they offered. 

I would've enjoy the game more if it played in 20 minutes or less, unfortunately it went on for twice that long [i](for a simple game it can induce AP).[/i] I wouldn't mind playing again, but I won't necessarily seek it out.[/i]

22-04-2015. Rated after 1 play. Flashly made the PnP. In the game you try to get VPs. You do this by getting VP tokens, getting cards, or 'advvancing' on planets. 

The game is a fun dice allocation game. In your turn you get 5 dice. These you roll and the results you can allocate to get those cards or advance on the planet. If you have attributed several, you may reroll the rest. The more 'rare' the dice roll (ie. yahtzee is difficult) the more points you get for the race or card.

Game was fun. It's not my type of game I love, but it was certaintly a fun dice fest. I felt a little that there was too much to do in your turn, so I'd rather not play 2+.

Cosmic Run is somewhere between a filler game and a family game -- and neither of those are a bad thing. The game offers some clever little dice-based mechanics and a few (simple) strategies for gathering points. The game isn't deep and it's not meant to be. Instead, the game is meant to be a light-ish, fun push-your-luck dice game that you could play with younger gamers, non-gamers, and even more "serious" gamers as a warm-up. And, in that regard, Cosmic Run delivers in spades.

Rahdo made me buy it. I don't really know why I got another SciFi filler game, because those don't hit the table that much around here. After first solo play, though, it is a bit of a dud - the meteor strikes are just random nastyness you can't really counter, since only spending 5 vp protects, but starting with two planets at two strikes, no real chance. Might be better multiplayer (due to the red dice reducing meteor strikes), will have to check, but with Tiny Epic Galaxies out, I would rather play that, even solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Cosmic Run is a light, fast and fun dice roller that is nearly flawless in it's design.

There is a small push your luck element in this dice allocation game,  in addition to cards which can manipulate dice or earn you points - outright or by set collection.  Add in an X factor - that being the meteor strikes - and there are many decisions to be had in such a simple game.

The absolute sweet spot for this game is 3 players.  It is fine with two,  but suffers the late player disadvantages with 4.  With 3 players,  I rate this a perfect 10 - with 2 a 9 and with 4 an 8.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys dice allocation games.  First star to the right and on till morning........

Space yahtzee race to terraform five planets before they turn into space dust from heavy meteor activity. Lock dice towards planet scoring, recruiting alien support, or build technology to aid with mining points and changing dice rolls.

I wish there were a push your luck risk on successive rolls.

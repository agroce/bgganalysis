RATING: 8
Sólo una partida a 5, juego de cartas de civilizaciones, muy concentrado, con muchas decisiones a tomar, bastante interacción directa e indirecta, y con un acabado bastante chulo, si bien los símbolos podrían ser más grandes para verlos mejor, y luego hay quienes se quejan del tipo de letra, pero como es sólo texto para ambientar, no afecta a la jugabilidad. Lo que sí se echa en falta en la edición es una libretilla para puntuación final, pero sobretodo, cartas de ayuda para todos los jugadores! Que sólo viene 1! Quitando este detalle que tan poco costaba, a la editorial hay que felicitarla por su trayectoria editando juegos muy buenos.

First Play: The problem I have with card based civ-building games is that they have a need for an attack and defend mechanic and unless you keep up with the spears and arrows arms race, you will be a victim pretty soon and lose.

The Flow of History is no exception. As a result the game has an immediate play pattern that must be followed to survive, let alone win. Even then, one player will be slightly behind in military and the prevalence of, 'attack a weaker civilisation a take/ destroy building Y means one player will always get raped and be playing catch up, just because they weren't in the right seat at the start of the game.

BugBear #2 is that building cards are turned and instantly available so this randomness will mean that planning ahead is impossible and completely reactive to what is turned. Some people enjoy this sort of 'excitement' but I find this level of randomness very infuriating.

The game works. It holds together well and the sequencing of the ages produces an up-ramp of benefits but this is a well trodden path and too chaotic for me.

RATING: 7
Takes a lot of familiar card-based civ building from games like Nations and Through the Ages, with building leaders and wonders, building military strength, etc.

However, the unique thing here is the way cards are claimed and bought, which is really neat. Players can set the price of a card, with other players having the option to match that price on their turns, with the player that set the price getting the proceeds. Or, if it gets back around to the player who set the price, he can just buy the card for the price he set. The money in the game is tight, so this gets really interesting, as sometimes you'll set a price, hoping someone pays you for the privilege of taking it, or sometimes you'll set a price in the hope of getting to buy it yourself.

The main drawback is that the cards just plain aren't that interesting. The engine building is really simple without any really fun twists or turns, and many cards are just clones of each other, substituting in different resources with the same effects.

Overall, if you like games like Nations and Through the Ages, this does something similar in a shorter time frame, and with a clever little bidding system.

Notes:

The first couple or rounds Flow of History plays very well. I would go as far as to say that it delivered a better experience than Innovation and Through the Ages, but then it the latter ages you realise that you have to keep your military strengh in line with the rest of the players or you going to be the the target of all military assaults. There is only one card that is going to pull you out of that hole and that is Gandi. Flow of History left me very frustrated, as I really liked the game until about halfway through - not sure if there is a way to salvage this one ...

One of last year’s greatest games was Ponzi Scheme by the same designer as this one. I had high hopes. My hopes were dashed. This is an over-long (90-120 mins) card game where you are building a tableau of civ cards. It is fiddley and there is a nasty military option (something I personally don’t like). But overall it is just all rather uninteresting.

1x5-player game. 

I expected a lot from this game but to say that I was left wanting would be somewhat of an understatement. Boring, puerto syndrome, more than half the point are made in the last turn, next to no control whatsoever. What's not to love, right ? 

I have been lagging the whole game being unable to stay in the arms race (which gets more and more brutal every age), but i won (or did I not ? It was such a bad experience that I do not clearly remember) through sheer luck of the draw/turn oder on the last two turns. Going from last to first, without having anything to do with it is not very rewarding. For anyone sitting at the table.

Perhaps if you were to play it with less players for an inordinate number of games, then it could start to be interesting. Because you would now all the cards and could start to build a strategy based on what's left in the pile... Well as it os this game all the flows of TTA (1st ed.), it is indeed a simplified version of it. But why bother ? The simplification significantly decreases the playtime but at the cost of the "civ-building" feeling. 

The components are quite nice. The snipping mechanism is nice. A shame really.

This is like a mix between Peloponnese and Through the Ages, two of excellent civ games, and with the weight falling squarely in between.  However, with the reduced number of cards compared to TtA, I wonder how long it will feel fresh after many games, but I am excited to fond out!

RATING: 7.5
Components: not very good quality on cards, some of them with marks
Complex: easy to teach and to understand
Weight: medium
Players: 4, could be good with 3 or 5
Length: less than 90 mins
Mechanics: set collection, "bidding", take that
Decisions: quite a lot, which cards you need, how much to invest, should I snipe...
Opinion: provisional rating, I have liked the game a lot, but would need at least one more play to confirm these good feelings.
Not much theme within the game, but this is not a problem for me. The idea is to develop your civilization during 5 ages, including a starting age A. In order to do that you will pursue several cards (buildings, knowledge, military, government, leaders and wonders), nothing new under the sun so far. Cards gained through the ages are stacked depending on the type, loosing the benefit but not the resources.
What I liked in the game... the resources, there is not much resources in a game, each player starts with only 4, and there are no more in the supply, there are actions to include them in the game, but lets say that in a 4 player game only 16 resources are in play. This is something to really take into account.
The invest is a kind of bidding, I will go for this card so I will invest X resources... are they enough? You have the option to snipe the card other players has invested, making him richer in resources, but you will have the card this turn (really interesting action, and something to also take into account). Investing makes you having the card in 2 turns, but you will have some bonuses depending on an investor bonus (you could pay 4 for a card and receive more than that after getting the card).
Then the military, something you cannot forfeit, but not determining the game, if you are low on military you can suffer a bit, but you have the option to invest in those cards ruining your strategy.
In a nutshell, fast paced game with lot of decisions, and playing with the timing. On your turn you do an action, then clean up, next player....
It seems that rating would be higher with the next play

Confirmed, rating up to 8 after the second play, fast flow of the game, nice invest mechanic and lovely snipe one. Game improves as you play more and more

A lot of people compare this game to TTA and state this is a simplified version of it (which is maybe true - I never played TTA ^__^' ), but this game remind me "Innovation", with way less chaos. It's also really shorter (once you know well the cards and the icons, a game with 4 players can easily be done in 1 hour). I recommand it!

An abstract Civ game that is a great synthesis of Innovation and Through the Ages.

I really appreciate the bid/snipe/trade dynamic. At first blush, it seems unfair how easily someone can steal the card you want to add to your tableau, but thanks to trade icons and good timing, being a "victim" is an opportunity. High trade becomes a deterrent; underbidding becomes profit engine. Another neat mechanic is the way that agriculture effectively controls inflation. The player with the most agriculture acts like the federal reserve. Dynamics like this make each turn dense with meaningful choices. 

The only minor complaint from first plays is the way that late-game cards are so much more powerful point engine than early game ones, but this is true of most Civ style games. While there is certainly room to log points in the early game, the first 3 ages are more about positioning for the endgame. 

Overall, it's an easier game to teach and quicker game to play than Innovation, with less of the chaos that can make that game divisive. 

Highly recommended.

Interesting short civ game, but it's not for me for two reasons:
- too much stress on military aspect - it defines too much what's going on in the game
- too much time spent on thinking how not to help the opponents (esp. the one making a move just after you) - this feature is DISQUALIFYING for me in any game

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is somewhat like Through the Ages in a much shorter amount of time with a lot of stuff cut out. One certainly does not want to fall behind in the arms race here either or life is going to be miserable. There is a bit of a challenge with the investing too since you can have your investments bought out from under you if others have enough money - although sometimes you want others to buy stuff out from under you so you can have a good bit of money. There is definitely some nastiness in this one so stay away if that is something you do not enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This civ themed card game utilizes a clumsy auction/sniping mechanic to acquire and build synergetic empires of leaders, production resources and wonders designed on improving and securing civilizations against competition from their rivals. The game cleverly reduces production abilities and power (attack/defense) to simple icons on cards and adds wooden coins as a secondary component for use in simulating the game's inflationary economy. There's a nice rhythm to the game as it builds tension through historical ages, leading to its climax when the deck is finally exhausted. I'm fond of the game but will admit it can be irksome to play when needed resources or abilities become hard to attain due to luck of the draw, or even worse due to constant sniping by opponents. From my experience this game has been hit or miss with friends so approval for it varies.

I REALLY wanted to like this game.  I was promised a civ builder and for the first half of the game I thought that's what I was getting.  Then the game morphs into an insane amount of attacking warfare where the person with the weakest military get's obliterated by other players with no way of catching back up.

Take Nations for example.  If I choose to remain relatively peaceful I can accomplish this with strategy and timely plays.  I don't have to go all out military or else.  In The Flow of History we see Jesse Li back at it again with his "attack early and often" game mechanism so disliked in Guns & Steel.  The only problem is there is no balance in the game whatsoever and if you don't keep up you get screwed by the third or fourth age.

There's one card that would allow you to remain peaceful.  ONE!!!  The Gandhi card allows you to avoid all attacks.  That's it from what I saw.  Otherwise you'll be tasked with forgetting all civ building strategy and going straight for military if you want any shot at all of sniffing a win.

I got the game in the mail and played later that day.  I am so very frustrated with this game and the fact that I wasted my money on a game I may not ever play again.  Also, not for nothing but I probably won't ever buy another Jesse Li game again.

I really like a lot of the mechanisms going on here, notably the splaying of replaced like-typed cards for some benefit. The dearth of harvest icons really stunted the economy and the impact of warfare was just too strong for me. If it could be mitigated somewhat it would not have been so bad, but even having one less strength than the other player results in full punishment. I like the speed at which it plays, but didn't really care for watching all of my points and abilities get blown up.

A card table building (and destruction) game. Players bid on a card of those available and another player can snipe that card instead of outbidding the current bidder, which has usually works out cheaper.
There is a LOT of take that in the game with players with less military strength losing cards from their tableau which may then reduce their military strength further and then incur further losses. This cycle of card loss appears difficult to avoid if you have the least military strength. Coupled with the randomness of the card draw, this is not a game for me.

The Flow of History is another card game that attempts to be a civilization game. Draw cards, build a tableau and score points in the end. One distinguishing feature of this game is sniping, where you pay another player's investment to take his or her card, but this is better executed in games like Key Harvest. At the end of the day, you are at the mercy of the cards that happen to be available at your turn (and if they're not military ones, you're doomed fall prey to your opponents).

Jesse Li re-imagined Innovation as a mid-weight Euro card game, and it improves upon the original in nearly every way for me.  This is a bloody gem that has flown WAY under the Essen 2016 radar.

And that's what angers me more than anything about the bloody yearly Essen hype.  Feld and Rosenberg create their nth iteration on the same tired frameworks they've built for the better part of a decade.  Meanwhile, tinier games with twice the brilliance get ignored.  Christ, it's tiresome.

Lighter civ game. Reminds me of TTA a bit with the unique deck of cards that you are working your way through to the end game. Building up your cards and each card does something different. Unique and weird auction mechanism and take a few rounds to really see how it is going to play out. Can't wait to see how this plays after a few games.

RATING: 5.5
Rated based on a single play.

The game was somewhat disappointing. It was hard to make combinations, and being sniped was very damaging, especially when it happened a couple of times in a row. The added resources did not seem to make up for the lost turn.

The result was a game in which most people just grabbed whatever card they could grab, which did not give the feeling that you could try to follow a specific strategy.

--Oct2016-- It's pretty fiddly as presented: one spends rather more time tracking the various symbols than I want.  I expect that a little symbol-counting sideboard (with piles of chips, perhaps; they're pretty easy to count & change) would make things more usable.
I found the game arc and story pretty nice, though: there's a bunch of apparently real decisions.  It's too long for a lunch game, though.

I want, but only in the smallest box they can pack it into. With only 67 cards and some basic tokens I don't see the need for it taking up much more space than Guns and Steel on the shelf. It's a small card game with some simple tokens being blown up into something unnecessarily big. So it's being turned into something it isn't and shouldn't be, but no doubt there's a market for it - just not me - so there you go.

"Deluxified™"? So taking the luxury out of something? Obviously not. Strange term.

It seems churlish to rate a game that does everything Innovation does but better a 6, but it feels as though the military angle is just too unbalanced to make the game fun.  Don't get me wrong, the core mechanics are excellent and good play is rewarded, but on the other hand, a tiny miscalculation and there's no real way back.  
A game in which knowledge of all the cards is essential.

Interesting decisions from the design point of view. Bid for a card but maintaining a certain amount of coins in order to snipe another card, as opposed to have to take the card you bid for in your next turn.

But all of the above is complicated to achieve as the card flow is somehow difficult to control, as are the timing on the sniper because there's the need to have available an interesting amount of coins that it's just impossible to predict. What I was most stressed about in the game was this complete sense of uncontrolled events provoked by other players and by hazard may or may not affect you.

Innovation meets TTA. 

As Innovation has grewn to become one of my gaming groups' favorites, and TTA is one of my more underplayed (due to length + weight) but always brilliant games, this is an absolute no-brainer to back now it is on KS.

Has flewn under my radar due to the non-stellar ratings from players not willing to "learn" the game (instead of only knowing the rules). Much like Innovation in a sense.
Still a respectable 7 tho, which speaks to its strengths.

Might be the bridge from Innovation to TTA, and will definitely a game I like. No hype, but some excellent reviews. Backed.

Lightish civ builder and set collection game with an odd economy.  The game seems to be in building an engine to compete with the other players.  You have to indicate which cards you are interested in purchasing and assign a value to them ala Key Harvest.  There is some tension there in correctly assessing the value to other players, but it is very light.  The board state seems to change rapidly so it is tough to assess the cards correctly.  I've read that military path can be very powerful, but it was not a factor in our game as military strength built up pretty evenly.  You play through every card in the game so the only variety is the order that the cards appear.  Decent game.

I wasn't too thrilled with this, especially compared to Guns & Steel (Early Edition). Most of the cards don't do anything very interesting, so it's mostly an exercise in collecting symbols.

This is sort of a mashup of Through the Ages, Patchistory and Innovation. Players work through a deck of civilization advances bidding on or stealing them from each other for the express purpose of building a tableau of matching icons which then make subsequent actions of that type stronger.

The game works very well and if you have never played those previously mentioned games, you will probably enjoy this quite a bit. If you are fan of those other games, then more than likely you will want to take a pass on The Flow of History because while it does borrow mechanisms from those other games, it doesn't really improve them. Instead, you get what feels like a Cliff Notes version of three vastly better games, which ultimately feels like a rather empty experience.

I realise saying a board game is heavily seating/left-right bound is almost redundant, but it also isn't too much of a criticism either, it's just a facet of the game. Nevertheless, combined with the economic cycling of the game, I'm not too sure it provides enough enjoyment vs achievement for all involved, & that the shared concern of military might detracts from the game & prevents real lateral scoring variety. Still, the piecemeal actions feel good, something not every game can offer.

Travel through history civilization card game with a take that edge. Military cannot be ignored. The unique play between players comes from the changing pool of shared economic resource tokens as buying cards adds to the supply that is available for production.  This leads to difficult trade off decisions.  Interesting element to place cards in your civilization up for sale to the other players.

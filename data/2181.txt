I can see what's good about Bridge BUT I feel that you have to get very good at it to get much out of it. Otherwise it's a four player game where one player has a good time, two players have a less good time and one person does nothing.

Unfortunately for my dad, Bridge never really appealed to me.  It seemed to have the worst part of chess (memorizing bidding conventions instead of openings) without many of the best parts.  I did enjoy playing hands where I needed to pull off finesses by deducing where cards were likely to be though.  This is another lifestyle game that I will never get into.

Hard to learn. Leaves a bit mechanical feel but still a good game.

Bridge is one of the great classics that is labeled as an old farts' card game. I learned to play Bridge (or at least tried) but did not quite get it. First of all, you have to learn a rather complicated bidding system. What makes it even harder is that there is no fixed one but you can make your own. Then you try to win the tricks.

I really think that the very soul of the game is in the bidding and thus for you to really enjoy Bridge you and your playing partner must come up with a system of your own. This is similar to building your own deck in MtG. Of course the tricks have to played properly but this is a bit mechanical process compared with the bidding.

Anyways, I believe Bridge is a wonderful game but needs a heavy investment of time.

Multi-billionaire Warren Buffet, once said that he wouldn't mind being in prison for the rest of his life, as long as he had three cell mates who would play bridge with him.  Despite whatever old persons baggage the game unfortunately has to lug around, it is still the best game for four, ever made.  This game is a great human achievement, and not just as a game, I consider this to be on par with the Golden Gate Bridge, for design genius.  The best game of the 20th century is still fun in the 21st century.

To me this is the real version of Hearts and Spades.  Bridge is possibly over complicated by the bidding system but the game play each hand is noticeably superior to any other 'trick-based' card games.  If you can find a good way to do the bidding quickly and without a lot of arguments or cheating in your group then this is (IMO) the best group game you can play with a deck of cards.

This one shares with King my personal "best classic card game ever" prize. A great card game that, depending on the version you're playing, involves little to no luck at all.

UPDATE: One of those games people tend to take way too seriously. It's a good game, but it's not that fun to play with the wrong crowd (which is almost anyone). Down to a 6.

My father was a very good player and my uncle and aunt were top-ranking players in France and my mother still plays it competitively. I don't have these aspirations, it's interesting but I find it tediously heavy and I prefer lighter card games in that vein like Belote or Tarot. I also noticed that Bridge partners tend to take their game TOO seriously!

RATING: 10
There is no game like Bridge. I've played Go, Chess, and many of the top Eurogames, Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, etc... Bridge rules. Go and Chess are wonderful, but complete analysis games. Bridge has just enough luck, enough probabilistic guessing, enough bluff and sacrifice, that it exceeds those two games by leaps and bounds, for me. If you've never taken the time to learn Bridge, do so, learn a good bidding system, then prepare for a multi-year ride of never-ending learning of more and more techniques, strategies and tactics. Your brain will thank you.

I'm a little more than put off by the prescriptive play, but I'm also intrigued by how people communicate during the bidding. Playing with the dummy hand was literally and figuratively revealing. We've been invited back, so I suppose there's a chance that this rating could go up.

Chess is sometimes called the "King of board games". Analogously, Bridge would be the "King of card games".

I miss my college days when I played duplicate every Tuesday night.  If you can find a group for duplicate it becomes a game of pure skill.  For me this is the prefect card game because it removes luck and rewards good play, I am engaged the whole time taking mental note of every card played.  There is no greater feeling then when your finesse works and you just barely make your bid!

The only thing that keeps this from a 10 is the fact that to play duplicate you need to have a dedicated partner and a dedicated Bridge Club or meet up.  Sadly I have not lived in a place where I have been able to enjoy this great game since college.

The penultimate card game.  Trick-taking, bidding, team play, and a depth of strategy that would probably take a lifetime to master.  The only downside is that there is a large learning curve for new players.  Still, there's a reason it's still so ridiculously popular after all these years.  The best partnership game available.

Easily my favorite. Unfortunately it is not very newbie or even novice friendly. The rules to play are simple, but the "rules" to play well are not. There is sooooo much to learn that the first steps are very difficult and frustrating. It takes repeated playing with patient individuals before you start to see how all the tactics fit together or even understand the reasoning behind them. At first its just an arbitrary mass of nonsensical guidelines. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favorite game. Memory means paying attention to whats been played, it takes a lot of practice.  But when you have mastered that, its a great deductive reasoning game.  Also, the techniques of how to win extra tricks are facinating (such as Squeeze play, trump coup, elimination/end play, discovery play, avoidance play, deception).

The bidding does take a whiole to learn.  While the rules are not complex, the judgement required and interaction of all the conventions makes it difficult for the beginner.

SO USE A SIMPLE BIDDING SYSYTEM TO BEGIN WITH!  CONCENTRATE ON CARD PLAY!

I do enjoy the occasional game of Bridge -- just as long as no-one's taking it too seriously!  As a straightforward card game, it's got the lot: interaction, clever mechanics, deviousness, screwage, the works -- and it's not too complicated to learn, despite what everyone might tell you.  What it also has, and really does not want, is a huge battery of Bridge Nazis who throw hissy fits if you even sneeze conspiratorially...

RATING: 7.8
RULES: ***** - The basic set of bridge rules is what I would call "minimal". Yet within this extraordinarily simple set lies a very deep an rich game.
STRATEGY: *** - Strategy is a difficult to grasp concept in traditional card games, however, in Bridge it is a part of the game. Varying the pressure during the bidding, psychological factors during the card play all make a part of the game. Some may be inclined to take a blind stab at a game whenever it is even remotely possible, some will try even for slams, some other players will try calm and well-calculated approach, some will try to gain overtricks at all costs, some will take the sure path and only take whatever is needed for the contract to make, and it will work out very differently in different situations.
TACTICS: ***** - Bridge is the only card game I know which allows a declarer such an advanced range of tools to achieve the declared contract, and its mainly because declarer is allowed to play two hands.
LUCK: **** - While in rubber bridge you can't do much when the cards are not going your way, having a visible dummy alleviates this somewhat, and then you can always play duplicate bridge, which eliminates the luck of a deal whatsoever.
PLAYER INTERACTION: ***** - Quite a bit of interaction and a battle of wits begins even before the first lead is made, because two pairs fight it out to see which of them will get the contract, and seek to make it the optimum of this hand. Of course, in club environment this interaction is rather silent, which may be disturbing to some people, but under that silence sometimes great battles are fought.
REPLAYABILITY: ***** - Every bridge hand is a different beast and usually offers different challenges to a player both in bidding and in playing (unless one becomes a dummy for that deal). Some hands do feel like they are plain and boring, but a fresh challenge does pop up every once in a while, dissipating that sense of staleness right away.
THEME: * - This being a traditional card game, of course, there can't be any theme to it. Frankly, it doesn't need one, but there are people, who just go "A plain old card game? Bleh..."
BALANCE: ***** - Rubber Bridge may get you screwed if all the deals go badly, but Duplicate Bridge really present everyone with an equal opportunity and the only thing that remains between a player and a victory is his own skill level.
DOWNTIME: *** - Bridge is a thinking man's game, however, it is less so than Chess, and most of the thinking is actually done after the first card is laid down on the table and dummy is revealed. After that it usually flows pretty quick, and experienced players will usually claim the tricks they are sure to take instead of dragging it on - which makes being a dummy not that demanding even if you are an instant-gratification junkie. If you are not, you will find being a dummy quite a welcome break from a brain-intensive game and an opportunity to relax before a next hand.
ACCESSIBILITY: *** - As already mentioned, it is a traditional card game, which automatically turns off any "cult of the new" member. Bidding systems, if not explained properly, make people cringe and think of high school calculus - equally unattractive. However, if bidding IS explained properly and some old-school action is fine by you, bridge is actually quite a simple game to grasp and get into.

I played Contract Bridge in our family as both a child, teen and adult.  It was fun but, we always felt bad that one person had to sit out while they were the dummy, and only 4 could play.

Now, we play Mu.  It supports 4, 5 or 6 all with grace, there is no downtime for any player and, the shifting partnerships keep everyone jockeying for position.  It is a much better recreational game. I suspect that it has similar depth to Contract Bridge.  Unfortunately, Mu will never have a chance at the mainstream fame it deserves because, it requires a non-standard pack of cards.

RATING: 9
The best traditional card game IMO. But only in the three
player variant. I am familiar with two of these variants.
Four player bridge with its fiddely wagering is not fun
at all. Being afraid to say a word during play is not my idea of a good time. Like my father and grand father before me I will definetly uphold the tradition in our
familys love of this game. Three player bridge shares many of the same good qualities as the three player game called "Ninety-nine".

Card game with easy rules but complicated bidding conventions which leads to some deduction. It's rather ok as a trick taking game, but a few things keep me from rating this higher: 1)Since the bidding is done by conventions, you lose some of your freedom to try some things out ; 2) Being the dummy player sucks since you do not get anything to do or think about for one deal.

I'm pretty certain this gets a low ranking due to bad experiences with other players.  A few times I've decided to give playing Bridge a try at other's urging.  Then it is so awfully taught, and tediously played, that I swear off playing it.  

I could see myself enjoying Bridge as a one night thing where everyone was at the same level and were playing for fun.  Instead, I end up seeing it played by people who have stripped any fun out of it.

In comparision, I really enjoy playing Spades, primarily because when I've been in groups that play it, it's been more for the social aspect, and fun.

Bridge and Poker are the two best card games.  Bridge requires great skill to play well, but is also fun at an entry level.  As your skill increases, you will want to play with others at the same skill level.  The only problem is finding three (3) other people who know how to play.  Woody Allen said Bridge was like sex.  If you don't have a good partner, you better have a good hand.

I have two (2) "bridge" size decks I use exclusively with Bridge.

Generally considered to be the finest 4-player partnership trick taking game with trumps ever designed. Significantly more popular with my parents generation, and that's who I learned it from. I actually prefer (our variant) of bid whist (see my Whist entry rated at 10) to bridge. However, I will admit that while I think that the hand play of bid whist is more interesting (since there are four closed hands/no dummy), the bidding in bridge is significantly more interesting than bid whist.

I've seen many geeks complain that there are too many conventions to learn in the bidding process, but I would argue that it's just a matter of a little study to learn them. Like any really good strategy game, it requires a little effort and practice put forth in order to be good at it. Growing up playing cards with the family gives me a greater respect for card games than most on the 'geek and I have a lot of respect for this game. Especially since my favorite type of card game is a four player trick taking game. Bid whist is tops, but bridge is a close second. (I consider Tichu to be a different type of game than these, but it also gets very high marks).

RATING: 10
I think of Chess, Go, and Bridge as being the 3 greatest games of all time - great in the sense of how deep they are. Bridge is my favorite of the 3.

Go and Chess are too anti-social for my taste; the only way to improve is playing lots of games without any fooling around. While bridge is also a serious game, each hand lasts less than 10 minutes so you get many short breaks which are opportunities to socialize.

Another social aspect of bridge is the partnership. Whenever I've had a partner for more than a few months, we started to get a feel for each other and develop our bidding system in a way which suited how we play together - and there was great pleasure in that, particularly when the fruits of our work began to bear out at bridge clubs.

The biggest downside to bridge is that there is a huge gap between casual social play and serious club play. I wish there was an easy "in between" where I could occasionally play serious players but without the (sometimes nasty) culture that can be found at some bridge clubs.

Another big down side is that it requires constant practice or your skills deteriorate. I wish I had more time to play in the last decade but I haven't and as a result I'm undoubtedly a worse player than I was 10 years ago.

The other down side is that the scoring and bidding are complex enough to create a big barrier to getting started. It is clearly not impossible though given that 10s of millions of people have played the game and I started teaching my son when he was 5.

Despite the issues I've mentioned above, Bridge obviously still has lots of appeal for many. Just understand that you won't get much out of the game unless you commit to many months playing several hours/week or more, combined with reading and/or classes. Once you overcome these initiation rites, the reward is a lifetime of developing partnerships and exploring the depths of good bidding and play.

====

I grew up with my grandparents who played frequent games of Poker (5-card Stud) and Bridge. Like most kids of my generation, I occasionally played Monopoly, Risk, Stratego, Strat-o-Matic, and Uno but I never really played many games until later in life. However, I remember being fascinated by my grandparents' card games and the seemingly magical language that they required (Bridge bidding is an amazing game mechanic). It wasn't until a few years ago that I finally played Bridge and for about six months I studied it hard and even placed 2nd in a 10-team beginner's duplicate tournament (my preferred method of play). I'll pick it back up again in the future once more time in my schedule materializes, but for now I'll merely yearn to play.

[2014.11.26]
I've always wanted to learn Bridge since I was a kid watching my relatives play.  I finally did and was not disappointed.  I love the idea of building a limited vocabulary of bidding for use in describing an astronomically large space of possible hands.  Playing the tricks is almost perfunctory for me.

RATING: 9
Deep traditional card game played in partnerships.  High barriers to entry as it is very complex due to variety of bidding conventions, defender play and declarer play but entirely worth the effort if you enjoy hand-management and limited information.  A lifestyle game that is played in a variety of formats, some very casual and some incredibly competitive.

Memorize a bunch of pre-set conventions and bid according to those.  If your partner wins the bid, congratulations, you get to completely sit out this hand with zero involvement!  Whee!

While I appreciate the amount of skill involved in Bridge, I just don't enjoy playing it as much as I enjoy some other trick-taking and/or partnership card games. The lack of dynamism between the declarer and dummy kills a lot of the enjoyment for me. Also, being the declarer is very much about executing a "correct" way of handling each situation, which a trait I don't enjoy in any game. Finally, the bidding is so convoluted that it's often more frustrating and silly than interesting.

A classic (obviously), and probably the best game you can play with a standard deck of cards.  Beats out Tichu by a fair margin, and makes Spades look like child's play (though I've enjoyed hours and hours of Spades over the years).  It consistently gets your heart racing.  What appears to be the goofiest part of the game -- the dummy -- is actually what puts Bridge so far above Spades, Tichu, Hearts, and every other trick-taking game I've played.  In those games, all you can see is your own hand, and so the quality of your play -- that is, how well it is theoretically possible to play -- is highly constrained by lack of information.  Exposing the dummy hand, so each player sees a different half of the deck, elevates play into another realm.

Another huge plus is that you can play online for free at any skill level at bridgebase.com (and probably a few other places).  The prospect of free online Dominion play coming to an end is one of the things that inspired me to take up Bridge.  And it turns out I like Bridge more than I ever liked Dominion.

The biggest problem with bridge, and why I don't rate it a 10, is its considerable barrier to entry, especially in learning how to bid.  I probably spent ten hours reading and working through the ACBL Learn To Play Bridge software before I felt able to just limp through a game with any amount of competency.  Learning from a good teacher would probably speed things up a lot, but anyone who wants to learn to play has to be willing to invest some serious time.  That said, the game is fun enough that you can have a good time before you really know how to play, if you're playing with people who don't take it too seriously.

In Bridge, the playing of cards seems largely systematic, and getting good involves memorizing bidding conventions.  There is one player (the dummy) every round who is guaranteed to have no choices.  People say it's a deep game and that you enjoy it more once you get the hang of it, but the times I've played haven't been particularly fun, and I'm not willing to put in the work to get good at a game that doesn't seem fun.

To own this game, all you really need to do is own a deck of cards, which I have plenty. :) We have a standing bridge group at lunch and get in about 10 hands a day.  Even after starting to learn the game three years ago, I'm still learning.  I just wish more of our wives played so we could have a game to play with non-gamer wives.

RATING: 3
This is such a classic card game, that it is hard to avoid rating it.  I find the play interesting, and the mathematics a chalenge. 

The downside is that most Bridge players are set social groups, and not open to new players.  Many groups do not play for the social aspect, and get very irritated with newbies.  

All-in-all, I prefer social games.  When it comes to cards, I will prefer the lighter Spades or Hearts over Bridge.

Hearts and Bridge are the two cleverest card games I know. Better technically as games than things like poker are. However as card games I refuse to believe they belong on this site. I also refuse to believe that bridge has been around for less than 100 years

Like chess, this requires substantial study to master bidding conventions and play of the cards to do well, and have fun, at this game.

However, there must be no better "rush" than to bid and win a grand slam, or a small slam, in this "mind reading your partner" card game.

Bridge is one of my favorite games.  There is so much depth to bridge - so much to learn.  It is truly a life game.  I've been playing for years and I still have only scratched the surface.  Bridge is really three games in one - bidding, play, and defense.  There are many books written on each one of these aspects - each aspect could take years to perfect.  I love a game that makes me think, plan, and requires lots of skill.  Bridge has it all.  Most of all, it's just plain fun.

RATING: 7
An intellectual card game that's so injected with snobbery in Britain that evaluation of the game itself is almost irrelevant. The need to learn a bidding system creates a high barrier to entry, it's just not possible to sit down with three friends and play. The social form of the game, Rubber Bridge, is crippled by luck of the deal, which is why bridge clubs are so interested in Duplicate. For friendship groups 500 is a better game as it has no pretensions and adapts for different numbers of players. After learning a lot of card games I'm deeply conflicted in my thoughts about Bridge. It's unquestionably very clever, but the po-faced nature of the game makes it more work than fun, especially against the kind of patronising expert who derides your play at every mistake.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
To those who take it seriously, I'm sure this is the finest game ever invented. I have only played a few times casually but it just doesn't seem fun at all to me. I much prefer 500 as a family game.

1st played 09/30/07. Basics are taught in ~15min for someone w/ trick-taking background, however you can spend hours figuring out bidding rules & strategies. In fact you can read books & play for months & still be a beginner. Playing w/ more experienced players is a disadvantage since the game is so complex. Deck is standard deck 2-A, w/ normal rank (A high). You & your partner work together to make a contract (bid a suit) passing clever signals to maximize pts while not getting set (not making bid). 1st you evaluate your hand A=4pts,K=3,Q=2,J=1, 7card suit=3pts,6cs=2,5cs=1. Opening bid(dealer first): 13pts=pass, 16-18bal=1NT, 13-21=bid 1 in longest suit, 22-24bal=2NT, 25-27bal=3NT, 22 =bid 2 in longest suit. Suit rank: NT, Major(Spades, Hearts), Minor(Diamonds, Clubs). So a bid of 1H is higher than 1D. A bid of one = bid of taking 7 tricks. Bid of 7 = bid of taking all tricks. Left defender (player to left of contract winner [declarer]) starts the round & declarer's partner places his cards face up on the table for all to see & declarer plays the cards for them. Scoring is tricks taken * level. Level: minor=20,major=30,NT=30 10. This is a fun game however it seems overly complicated to learn keeping many players from trying it.

Too much emphasis on memorization for me, both in the card play and the bidding conventions. I've been told that once you've internalized all of the conventions that bidding can become really interesting and if you have a good enough memory to remember all the cards that have been played you can make some clever plays, but I both don't have particularly good short term memory for the card-play part and don't care to memorize the conventions for the bidding, so I find the game really uninteresting.

As a low-intermediate player I enjoy Bridge on a casual level and an infrequent basis. I don't like it enough to devote any real time to it, and the diminishing returns learning curve of these types of games (chess, go) discourages me all the more from doing so. I equate it to me shooting hoops in the backyard for fun when I feel like it. It's fun to just get out there and maybe make some shots.

The best trick-taking with a trump suit game out there. Period. But the catch is whether you get the number of tricks you expected and what is trump… that's done through a coded bidding system that requires a lot of learning.

HUGE MINUS: this requires lessons to learn all the bidding codes and procedures (though easy to play once you've got them)

Love to play bridge, but as any 20 or 30-something player knows....finding anyone remotely close to one's own age who plays is difficult. Mostly have to wait to play with family at the holidays.

This is, at its core, a quite simple game in terms of the card play. What puts people off is the time and repetition required to wrap your head around bidding systems and the various conventions that get a partnership to the right contract. Good defensive play is also a difficult skill to acquire (I don't have it).

One of the few games that I could play for 12 straight hours and it would feel like 1 or 2.  It's like a fun logic puzzle most hands, deducing where the various key cards are and deciding on the right play, both when declaring and defending.  The only things keeping it from a 10 are when you wind up with the dummy hand for multiple hands in a row, and there's too many regular bridge players who get uptight and feel like having fun is against the rules.

[LUP 05-Oct-2007] Actually this exposes a slight dilemma I have with the rating system.

In terms of quality of game is is 7-9 in terms of my willingness to play it since 1998 it is 3-4.

I tried to get into this, I really did.  Even read a whole book on it.  I can see the depth of the strategy and the fascination the game holds for many.  What I couldn't get over was learning the different bidding conventions.  Even just enough to get beyond the novice stage seemed like a huge barrier to entry.  Going back to book I read, the first 60+ pages all had to do with bidding, most of it more along the lines of rote memorization than actual strategy.  And I hadn't even gotten to the actual PLAY of the hands yet!  It would be like in chess, once you learned how the pieces moved, the next step was that you had to memorize a bunch of opening lines into the 10th move and beyond.

It is therefore difficult to play with people who are not already experienced players themselves.

I know how to play and have a few strategy books on the subject, hence why I marked it as 'owned' when it is kind of owned by anyone with a deck of cards and the ability to score a game.

The only game I've taken classes on how to play.  More of a lifestyle than a game.  

As competitive, duplicate bridge, I don't enjoy the enforced silence and lack of interaction.  There are rules and rules about how you can't communicate with your partner, and yet the bidding is all about communication with your partner, but somehow the conventions aren't cheating...ok.  I just can't take it as seriously as enthusiasts do.  Go ahead and call the director on me.  I really did have an itch.

Duplicate Bridge is in my opinion the ultimatimate strategic game and the best one ever made (it scales well from 4 palyers till allmost unlimited). That is when you participate in any of the competitions forms either in pairs or teamplay (4 players). 
Since luck is bascially removed from the game when all or most couples play the same cards against different opponents (either simultaneously or by passing the hands to anaother table) and constantly changing opponents. 
It combines cooporative play with vast degrees of strategic and tactical moves and several possibilities for deduction (wher you need to keep up communication with you partner). 
The core of the communication is the bidding system (there is a great variarity to chose from) that you declare to the opponents if necessary) and the better your communication is the better your result will be. The second feature is the skill of playing the cards, reading your opponents to figure out where the important cards are situated and closing or beating the bid contract.
Compared to other boadgames it has a rather steep learning curve (that make be its only drawback but still is an encouraging challenge) and a life long playing to master (if ever completely).  Replayability is infinit since you are not likely to encounter the same set up in two games in a life time and if you should it would be against different oponents still making for a new game. 
It is possible to play for fun or at world class competition level with the same degree of enjoyment.
It is simply a game that I will never grow tired of even after 30 years of playing. In my opinion it actually could not be rated at the same scale as other games and should be 10+ alone.

I only play Duplicate and I doubt any other game will ever rate a 10.  It's one of those pursuits you can spend a lifetime on and never completely master.  It requires a great deal of time and study (and frustration) to learn.  It's something of a cross between Chess and Poker, and except for Poker, all other card games pale in comparison - it makes Euchre look like Go Fish.

One of the most interesting card games in existence.  A game where skill matters and luck only adds variety.  The main problem is the barrier to entry (different bidding systems make it harder to find the right partner to play with, and given that it's skill driven it can be imbalanced), but it's the game that kept my grandmother happy and in the company of friends all the way into her old age, a real blessing.

My mother plays very well (my father also used to play quite a bit, although he hasn't really in years), and has tried to teach us kids many times about the value of the game.  I can't get into it.  It's a big, complicated, lifestyle game that I really have in interest in learning.  Between Chess and ASL, it would be easy enough not to play anything else as it is.

I lost large chunks of my life to studying this game. The fact that you and your partner can devise your own bidding system and carding signals makes it deep beyond belief, not to mention the myriad pure tactical positions that arise.
I'm dinging it a point for the fact that the learning curve is so steep for the novice.

Certainly not a bad game, just not to my taste (and I stink at it).

Complaints:
1) Proper bidding has to be done according to rules, and I find these are usually complex (bidding placemats). Since there's no choice to be made, I'd prefer it was automated, or a summary of results was given.
2) Too much memorization for my tastes.

I like the idea of deductions (suit splits based on probabilities, etc), and controlling the flow between self and partner. The concept of dummy is good too. But in practice I just don't enjoy it.

For a short period of time many years ago I played in a local bridge club, which was quite enjoyable. Very interesting game. I enjoy duplicate bridge much better than rubber bridge. Duplicate bridge I rate an 7.5, rubber bridge a 5. For me to do really well at duplicate bridge I would need to play frequently and have a dedicated partner.

The ONLY standard card game that is worth playing.  It's more like chess than cards because the entire deck is dealt out and you and your partner have half of it.

You get to communicate your hand through the bidding process.  This is a gamer's game just like any other. I made player aids for this game (and still have them) a la Universal Head on cards with a typewriter back in the day as bidding aids.

This game has a connotation of being played by the elderly. The elderly often have an image of forgetfulness or of entrenched, inflexible thinking. I don&#039;t know how they would play that game if either were true. Bridge is amazingly complex and variant; each hand can present a unique challenge that you may never again in your life face. Nevertheless, that hand is likely to be critical to your success of that game.

Gioco di carte a coppie. Bridge/Ponte sta ad indicare lo sviluppo del gioco, ovvero la collaborazione a ponte tra i due compagni di squadra cercando di rendere inoffensivi e fuori dal gioco gli avversari. Molto avvincente e complessa la dichiarazione iniziale. Il bridge è il più stategico tra i giochi di carte (tra quelli con le tradizionali carte) e come gli scacchi ha la propria federazione con tanto di professionisti dediti allo studio e allo sviluppo di questo gioco.

Rating means no judgement of the game's qualities, it only reflects my motivation for playing it.

Bridge is certainly one of the deepest trick taking games; however, at least in my perception, Skat and Doppelkopf are really in the same leage with Bridge in terms of depth, if not even superior. 

The bidding in Bridge is indeed the strategic high end of trick taking games, but its gameplay itself feels rather common and not very variable to me. I have played Bridge only few times in my life, and last time was in 2005, but if I remember correctly, then Bridge has only 2 play modes (trump suit or non-trump). Skat, on the other hand, comprises 3 official and at least 1 inofficial play mode that require totally different tactical approaches. These make the game very variable, and as a side effect of having those different play modes, it's also quite tricky to make a good evaluation of your hand, which effectively makes bidding in Skat a really advanced business. For Doppelkopf I'm not even sure how many different game modes exactly exist, but there are at least 5 and a lot of tiny optional rules, plus a VERY interesting mechanic of hidden parterships, which all make it a very unpredictable, entertaining and fun game - features that Bridge lacks a bit for me.

This is an extremely complex game with lots of conventions, but still easy to play as beginner as long as all are. 

Played this every break for three years in high scool. First we were two in my class that knew the game, and at the end of third year 20 of the 24 in my class were playing, we ran from the classrooms to get a seat at the two tables we had, and whoever you sat down with we had an ongoing game to continue. The rest of the class as well as others stood around as audience! 

Once, we had a free period and placed a table in the middle of the classroom, me and two of my classmates played a game with our history teacher. When the period was almost over another teacher came into the classroom with his class to teach. Our teacher just said: "we're in the middle of a game here" and the other teacher replied "ok, we'll wait outside" and marched out with his class and let us continue.

A group of us wanted to try bridge for some time to see what all the talk was about however we did no want to play with professionals as we know how serious people take this game. We learnt the rules and one convention and played for about 2 hours. At this point we realized that it must just be tradition that keeps this game going as it is not fun. The bidding convention almost plays for you and one player basically does not play each round. There is a lot of visible information based on the bid and open hand of one player that the game plays itself and you just hope that you either have the right cards or you opponent makes a mistake. I have played a lot of trick taking games and this will not be one that we play again.

Tough to find players, but I love this game and could play it any time. Played in zone.com and on PC extensively a few years back. Fascinating game, many pro chess players play this after they retire. Nov-08, playing regularly again, online at bridgebase.com, and face-to-face group being developed.

Oct 2014: Haven't played this face to face too much since 2009 or 2010, as the main core player in my group faded away, and another moved. Doubt I will put the effort into developing a group to play this again. There are many other faster and easier entry games I am playing these days. If a player or couple moves into my area that plays the game I'd gladly jump in again, and Bridge will always be a 10 to me.

I've never played serious, competitive Bridge, but I can see the appeal of it. I learned to play Bridge as a senior in high school.

Nobody in our generation played Bridge, though, so we only played with each other when we were all back in town over break.

A trick-taking trump card game with complicated scoring.  I understand that if you get deep into how the scoring system should affect your strategy, it makes this game a cut above the average trick-taking game.  I just haven't reached that point, and never will.

The whole table-talk versus "conventions" is sort of silly to me - but I can see how this has big impact on the strategy of the game.  Table-talk is illegal, but if your partner has a "convention" you exchange information anyway.  Experienced partners could kill after years of developing their tricky bids.

Now we know how Grandma and Grandpa do it...every...single...time.

RATING: 8
The indisputable king of trick-taking card games. The card play in itself isn't different from Spades, aside from the fact that suits than spades may also be trumps and that there can actually be games with no trumps at all. 

What sets Bridge apart is its bidding phase, where choice of the trump suit is awarded to the team that commits themselves to make the highest number of tricks. It is a fantastic mechanic that allows you to have a clear picture of your partner's hand strengths (both in general and in specific suits) and reduce the consequences of randomness of the draw. 

In a game of Bridge you are not fighting to have more tricks than your opponent but to make the most efficient use of your hand. This means that the goal in each game will tend to be adequate to the strength of each team's hands - so skill prevails over luck.   

The only reason Bridge isn't higher in my list is that conventions for the bidding phase are a beast to learn and teach to new players.

By modern standards Bridge might well be considered horrifically inaccessible. The rules are very simple, but the scoring system is very complicated and unfortunately much of the strategy depends heavily on the scoring. In order to have a chance you also need to learn off a communication system with your partner. Once you get over all that, however, you can enjoy a really great game of tactics and probabilistic analysis, with near-infinite replayability.

Trying to remember the Acol bidding system is holding me back at the moment.  There are too many other good games to play, so I don't have the time to remember sufficient basic Acol.

RATING: 8
My favorite card game. A rightfully deserved classic. 
The card play rewards memory and observation remembering the bids - what has been played so you can calculate the likelyhood of squeezing out that last trick.
To play well requires understanding the bidding so you determine the right number of tricks to bid. Most of the conventions revolve around determining if a slam is possible and in what suit. 
In playing a casual game don't worry as much about the conventions for slam, but how to correctly bid your tricks for a game.

Didn't mention how many good memories I have of bridge - my parents loved to play and us kids were the extra partners. I guess I would have to chalk bridge up as the game that made me a life long boardgamer (yes I know it is a card game --- but it instilled a love of games with me).

RATING: 8
An excellent game - in my opinion it is possibly the best game invented before 1990. It's main flaw is requiring exactly 4 players.

Yes, this is just a standard deck of cards plus a bridge scoring card.

I managed to play this with Euro-gamers who haven't played Bridge before. I found a one-page player aid for a convention here:

https://www.nofearbridge.com/

I wanted to try Bridge with non-Bridge players because I didn't want to be scolded for simplifying the game for our needs (i.e. keeping cards from won tricks face-up).

I admire Bridge's bidding systems; you can very accurately communicate the strength of your hand to your partner. However, this makes Bridge very, very analytical and sucks all the fun out of the game. Following a bidding convention makes me feel like a robot. Because each player can see half the cards in the deck during trick play, that phase also makes me feel like a robot.

Note that there is quite a bit of ambiguity in bidding conventions. This is the source of many, many arguments. Bidding conventions have to be followed strictly. But "strictly" can be interpreted differently among a partnership. (This happened in our last game, but I think this actually resulted because of personality differences rather than an interpretation of the bidding convention.)

Minus one rating point because of the dummy mechanism. One player out-of-play each round is simply not fun.

I'd like to try this one more time, but that means I have to slog through a book on Bridge :(

I'm not particularly fond of trick-taking games, and Bridge is probably the reason why, in much the same way that bad-tasting medicine made me hate anything cherry-flavored. The game is so over-analyzed that a new player can't even begin to learn the rules without being trampled on for not 'bidding correctly' (i.e. bidding in such a way as to make absolutely no sense whatsoever). If someone I expected a very large inheritance from demanded that I play bridge again, I might, after estimating how long they were likely to live, and how likely playing Bridge was to cause my suicide.

RATING: 6
This game makes for an interesting solitaire puzzle in the newspaper.  As a game, it feels way too mechanical.  Played correctly, hands bid themselves.  Once in a contract, it's just a matter of simple probability and attempting to finesse a card or two that might make or break the contract.  It's mostly autopilot, and that's not even counting your partner who wins the privilege of sitting patiently and watching you play both hands.

Historically, a very popular trick taking standard deck playing card game that pits two partnerships against each other. First is the auction, where the partners are able to verbally pass encoded information about their hand contents to give themselves the best chance of bidding correctly. The play features one member of the team that won the auction trying to win as many tricks as he can by playing both his team's hands, while the defenders try to stop him from making his contract.

The duplicate version of the game has many pairs, each playing the same hands separately and comparing their results. This process removes the luck-element of getting good cards and boils it down to a demanding test of partnership skill.

People dedicate their lives to playing this game without ever reaching mastery. A complex and deep, yet approachable and social game all in one.  

If only I knew others who would play it with me...

Este é o clássico dos clássicos dos jogos de vazas. Um baralho convencional e algum papel para anotaçao é o suficiente para jogá-lo. Considerado o xadrez do baralho, este jogo envolve mecanicas de leilao, percepcao e raciocionio apurados. 
A única ressalva é que são necessários 4 jogadores (2 duplas) e, para um melhor resultado, conhecer convençoes de leilao que sao métodos usados para passar sinais de suas cartas ao seu parceiro.

I played an awful lot of bridge - both competitive and casual - between the ages of about 18 and 26 (~2001-9), and while circumstances have changed such that I haven't played in several years, I have certainly not lost interest in the game. It is quite simply the best game you can play with a traditional deck of cards, especially duplicate bridge, the tournament game. (Teams of four is my favourite format, but I enjoy any form of competitive bridge.). There is just so much to learn and so many different aspects of the game. I know traditional games aren't particularly popular on BGG, but every gamer ought to learn bridge - although I admit that it does have a fairly steep learning curve (even for those used to trick-taking games), and really needs you to learn along with a partner.

The best partnership game around.  The dummy hand makes the play very deep for both defenders and declarers, and the possibilities in the bidding system are inexhaustible.  Tournament style bridge eliminates virtually all of the usual card game luck of good and bad hands.  The only problem is dealing with UI situations, and the only reason this problem is almost unique to bridge is that no other partnership game is played at the same high level.

I played a bit of this in high school and college. It's a good game, but I never was able to wrap my mind around the bidding process. I had a bad habit of taking too long to bid or play a card. Not that I have a pattern of that or anything.

I'm not very good at it, only decent, but will never tire of it. I don't know why it is so satisfying to me, as it involves significant luck and memory factors, which I normally don't like in games. Must be the element of blind cooperation and reaching an understaning by very limited means.

  WOW, what a fantastic game!  As a Spades fan, this is right up my ally, so I taught myself using BridgeBaron.

Wish I could get my friends to start playing this regularly.

It's Bridge. Another classic card game. I'd rate this game higher if it wasn't for the dummy player. Four players bid, but only three players play out the thirteen cards. I don't really like games where people have to sit out, although this adds some interesting strategy to the game. For better or for worse, Bridge has quite a following and subculture. This means if you play with anyone "serious" you have to learn one or more bidding systems. Kinda makes it difficult to play the game lightly.

As long as I'm not playing against people who think they know everything.

One of the things that I dislike about bridge is that technically your partnership can't have secret bidding rules.  I think this is a) lame and b) unenforceable ("oops, I guess we got that convention wrong then").  But nobody asked me..

Ah well, I guess it'd be okay for me to be put in a convalescent home when I'm old. Bridge is okay, but I'm not playing it until I'm 60+ years old. I sense I'll be playing a lot of it past that age. Don't like all the bidding conventions and groupthink. Spades is cleaner, and Mu offers similar feel. Also prefer any other Chinese partnership card game.

I really love trick-taking games (well, card games of all stripes), so I really see the appeal to this game.  Unfortunately, the aspect of this game that actually makes it the most interesting is the bidding.  While you can pick up a rudimentary understanding of bidding in a pretty short amount of time, this small amount isn't really enough to make the game truly worthwhile / enjoyable.  I do hope to someday put a little more effort into really learning bridge (I do, after all, tend to read bridge columns in the newspaper).  Unfortunately, the time is not now.  As it currently stands, I will happily play (and enjoy myself) from time to time (and actually look forward to playing again), but it is not currently something I seek out. [08/14/2007]

Seems like any other card game, but step into a bridge hand and you suddenly are trying to guess the location of every card our there by virtue of who bid what and played what. And the bidding has kept the experts frustrated for 100 years.

Playing Duplicate transforms the game into one of life's greatest arts, as all luck is effectively removed.

For a medium-length game for four players, play 12 hands, swapping partners after each 4 hands. Total scores.

Nothing else like it. Learn how to play it, and every other card game is child's play.

Deep and engaging, Bridge rises above all other card games. The auction is all about communicating with your partner, not just taking the bid. This creates a unique gaming experience.

After a handful of plays, I find that I do like bridge, but I don't understand many of the subtleties of it.

But, despite all of that, I do enjoy playing the game, I only wish I were better at it.

The enjoyment has started fading a bit lately. This is just one of those games I admire much more than I enjoy. Much of the fun from bridge comes from getting to know the meta game of bidding conventions en learning the right way to play a hand. But these are not particularly things I'm very interested in studying, which is the main way to go if you don't play on a fairly regular base (which I don't).

*********
I love trick taking games and of course, this is the yardstick all others are measured by. At the same time, it's quite intimidating and to get any real enjoyment out of it, you need to play this a lot, preferable with the same people. I do like it, but the whole metagame of studying and learning conventions is not something I'm particularly interested in.
I'm afraid there's no such thing as 'casual' bridge, playing this only a few times per year with varying opponents and partners. Still, I'm very intrigued by the game and would like to play it more.

Bridge has everything, including a huge barrior to entry. The learning curve is very substantial, but worth the effort in every respect. Bridge has a perfect blend of complexity, variety, logic, deduction, and bluffing. No other game offer a complete spectrum of strategy and tactics.

On top of that, you can get a game in most major metropolitan areas on practically any day or evening.

Shares the "expert" problem with chess: you need to play with an exact number of players (4 in this case), and they should be around your skill level for you to enjoy this.

Played online only. Contract Bridge.

There's no argument to be made about the quality of the game. Yes the bidding is arcane and you aren't always playing but it's truly interesting to see how a bids then plays out in cards. That said the bidding system is my main concern. I dislike the 'exact' nature of them in conjunction with no luck (all cards in play). I prefer games that allow some form of chance and bluffing. No doubt I've only seen a fraction of what is on offer but that's the way it goes. 

Anyway, it's not a game the sort of game I enjoy playing. Much like Chess, this is a game for people who want to think (thank goodness you can sit out some hands) and not for people who want to relax in a social atmosphere. As such this is a miss for me.

The epitome of card games.  Never mastered and new things to learn every time its played.  If you get the right bridge partner, it is a fabulous game.  Bridge partners have to think alike and be joined at the hip as it were.  I had one in college, where we killed everyone and had "mental telepathy" when it came to playing bridge.  Too bad no one seems to want to learn anymore. Tried to talk my son into learning, as I know he'd like it a lot once he got into it, but too many other things he'd rather play first.  Unfortunately, it takes a long time to get anywhere near good with the same partner. Haven't really played in a number of years.  Euchre seems to be the boring alternative amongst a lot of people.  It's about 5% of the fun of playing bridge (when it's done well).

I now have a library on the subject and many card decks to play with (lots of score pads and tallies), plus a couple of Bridge related board games (see 3M Challenge Bridge, Bridge for Two/(Three), Autobridge and Rolomatic Bridge). We play mostly the precursor to Bridge: Whist. I just got a quick Bridge lesson, there's a lot to bidding, will have to study.  Most important to use the same bidding system with your partner in practice. Many different bidding systems. Contract? Double? Redouble? I still have a lot of questions.

Since last month (Sept. '09) I've been going hog-wild over Bridge.  I've read a couple books, played quite a lot of computer Bridge and electronic Bridge, also acquired quite a lot of Bridge stuff on ebay, including ALL THE AUTOBRIDGE sets!! Also, have a nice set of Duplicate Bridge boards and got the newest Saitek handheld, plus really powerful PC Bridge software (Bridge Baron 21). I also got a neat set of Culbertson's Bridge Chips for bidding!

I'm a casual Bridge player- I know hardly any conventions beyond Blackwood and Stayman, have never played Duplicate, and always play in a very informal setting.  

There's still a wealth of communication and card smarts necessary even in our casual, luck-filled rubbers of Contract, and if I were to ever tire of it, I know there's a wealth of depth and complexity I haven't touched but could easily plumb.  It's an enduring, proven classic that I will almost always enjoy.

EDIT:  I think it's time to admit that I just don't love bridge like I used to.  It doesn't help that most people play with such strict conventions that there really isn't any room for creativity in bidding.

A great and challenging traditional card game. Main negative: the range of bidding systems and conventions are rather overwhelming, especially when playing duplicate bridge.

Bridge is a fantastic game, but it requires so much study and exactly 3 other people (who've done the same amount of study) to play it, so I wouldn't be surprised if I never play it again.

Alapkártyajáték. Látok benne lehetőséget, de csak úgy tudnék kezdőként leülné mellé, ha a játékostársaim is kezdők. És mondjuk együtt játszunk mindig így együtt fejlődünk, együtt fedezzük fl a lehetőségket.
A konvenciók nem az én világom és ennyi játék mellett nem is lesz.

RATING: 10
A fantastic game.  I love the scientific card play, made possible by the fact that all the cards are dealt out, and that the dummy hand is exposed.  And bidding is a fascinating puzzle of communication through a severely limited, noisy channel.  It's too bad that the game has such a steep learning curve, and that as a hobby, it's on a long, slow decline from its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s.

Great game, never gets old.  Only draw back is it takes exactly 4 and to appreciate the game you need to have a continuous partner to properly develop all the details of a good bidding and signaling system.

I know it's a little silly to say that you "own" a game like bridge, since all that really means is that you own a regular deck of playing cards and (hopefully) you know how to play.  But since I own about 20 decks of specialty cards, I figured I'd list a couple of card games as games I "own" since I can't list "Zombie Survivial Playing Cards" (etc.) as a game.

RATING: 5
Bridge is the epitome of a genre that I hate: trick-taking games.  There's a sizable learning curve that I've never been able to overcome, but to be fair I've never tried too hard.  Bridge, like [gameid=171], [gameid=463], or [gameid=2162], is subject to a whole culture of its own, except that this culture is decidedly more, er, mature than the cultures of the other games mentioned.  I'm not willing to invest what it will take to get good (or even competitive!) at this game.  Chalk it up as another fine game for which I care very little.

RATING: N/A
Wonderful if you have a good partner for Duplicate Bridge: play a few dozen hands, compare your scores with other teams and discuss the tricky deals. You will be relieved when you are the dummy player and can sit back for a few minutes, at least if you haven't messed up the bidding.

An ingenious game that never ceases to challenge.  I happily spend many of my Thursdays at the local duplicate club.  It also succeeds at being both fun to play, and fun to study in an academic sense.

Not marked "Owned", since I don't have boxes.  I can't imagine playing without boxes.

Who owns a deck of cards that can't say they own this game?  Mind I'm not talking about pwnage.  I'm not great at this game, just because I'm usually too lazy to play with my whole brain and count the cards while figuring out the probabilities. Drives my Dad nuts, but he's so clinical when playing this game it sucks. Listed here so it is an option for "I don't know, what do you want to play?"

Good gravy, I stink at Bridge.  I've bought books, played PC games have a whole bunch of variants (see below) and I *still* don't have it down.  Seems to be one I would need to play A LOT to ever figure out.  I keep trying...

The only way to play this is duplicate, and learning a system of conventions takes time, effort, and a willing partner who will take the voyage with you. Those barriers all being mentioned (which at present keep me from fully embracing this game), Bridge is THE quintessential card game.

The game is really good, it is the epitome of trick-taking card games. However, it is very difficult to play it with serious players (you have to dedicate a lot of time learning to bid well, etc) and somehow playing it "just for fun" doesn't feel right.

Between Go and Bridge, it's hard to decide which game is better. Go has absolutely no luck, and perfectly matches one mind against another. Bridge incorporates luck, and thus risk management, and three other players instead of one (and thus a social aspect that Go lacks). Bridge is probably the best card game ever invented: some would say Poker, but in my opinion, Bridge incorporates everything you can get from Poker, and provides more. Bridge's big downfall is that it's a four player game: with any other number you play another game (for example, Skat, with three). There aren't many single games in the world to which people devote their lives: Bridge is one of them.

RATING: 4
Over-regulated. Having to tell your opponents what you think your partner meant by a bid, is a game taken way too seriously. Happy to divulge that I'm not any good at this game, but there are many games that one can play badly and enjoy.

That said there was an excellent response to a question I had about bridge that lifted my rating of it. I just wish I noted down where it was.

RATING: 6
This game is overly complicated, and suffers from too much boring downtime where there are no interesting decisions. Being the dummy clearly sucks, but playing when your team didn't win the bid is also pretty tedious and trivial. While I love the complexities introduced by bidding, most of the game is a waste of time. The actual "game" part is only fun when you won the bid, and that sinks it for me.

I inherited three nice bridge sets from my grandmother:

1) Simultane bridge cards by Sonia Delaunay, 2nd Ed - 1980 (very good condition)

2) Caspari bridge cards featuring "Water Lilies" by Claude Monet (good condition, some edge wear from play)

3) Piatnik Precolumbian Playing Cards (new in shrink)

Allison and I have started playing regularly at our local bridge club. We're superstars there for being under the age of 50. :)

I don't have the time or motivation to put in the studying it would take to really get good, but I'm having fun puttering along in my current "competent amateur" state.

Sometime in 2012:
The best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be... in the world of playing cards with a regular deck of cards.

OK... I traded a duplicate bridge board. But as for the game itself, every one who owns a deck of card can own the game. Just the need to know how to play! :)

As compelling as the bidding is, it's difficult for me to look at two things - the passiveness of the 'dummy', and the sheer rote go-through-the-motions of defense half the time - as anything but huge mechanical flaws.

As an avid card player, for some reason bridge just hasn't appealed to me, I suspect it is due to the fact that most of the strategy is in the bidding, rather than the playing.  Frankly, I can deal with the complexity of gameplay rules, but having to remember all the intricacies on bidding as a way to communicate to your partner, that's not worth the effort to me.  So no thanks.

Just reintroduced to Bridge after years of neglect.  The ultimate in card games.  I like playing with a parner that isn't as good I am, so my mistakes don't look quite so bad.  I still confuse some of the conventions in bidding, but I really like to play.

Never played. Dislike card games. And this King of Cardgames is so difficult, it makes my head hurt. My parents played it 24/7, so I do have an idea what I'm talking about. If you're looking for a challenging card game with lots to learn and a large player base, this is probably it. It's just not what I'll play.

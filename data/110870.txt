There was nothing wrong with this game, just no reason to play it further. The first turn plays about the same as the 15th because there is no progression. Very light card game, not much to say about it.

Not too bad a card-game (says the guy who's not a fan of card games usually). For those who say you need at least one extra cave to win, that's not true: there are other ways of getting fire. For those who say the only strategy is to draft cards with idea icons on them in order to win, that's partially true; but you need to feed those guys with ideas...and you need teeth icons to hunt for food, etc. So it's not quite as simple as you might think.

It's not a great game, but it's certainly not bad, either.

I rather enjoyed this one. Seems like a fairly simple tableau building game at first, but the need to hunt animals necessitates careful building, as the more varied stone types you have on your cavemen, the more likely that you are going to have to kill someone when you hunt. Our play stretched on into the 90 minute range due to bathroom breaks and a loud room, but I can see this getting banged out in 30-45 with max player size and an experienced group.

Rating after one play:

A light, entertaining card game of recruiting tribesmen, slaying dinosaurs, finding caves, developing technologies and managing your food and money.  Loads of luck and a little strategy, this fun game is easy to learn with just enough strategy.  Great humorous artwork and characterisations round out a nice little package.

Solo two-player test seemed okay, but actual two-player game seemed endless. Don't know what it was-- "lightbulb" cards coming out late? Not enough food? I suspect that additional players would drag the game out even more, since fewer of these cards would be available per player (despite the lowered lightbulb-card requirements). Disappointed.

A fun game that involves worker placement. Takes a game to get under your belt enough for a winning strategy to kick in but very fun. A ton of worker placement and strategy for a game in a small box with a few simple moving parts.

Very unique take on a traditional Euro card game. The auctions can be extremely brutal if there is an experience gap with the players.

RATING: 5
TRADED IT!

The only goal of the game is to get X light bulb symbols on your cards, so obviously THESE are the cards you must own, all the other game effects are just a means to an end. The problem with this is most of the game is just a filler subgame to get these cards (herein lies the glamour of the theme and components). If your auction goes badly and you can't acquire these cards, you simply wait about for another to win.

The game is OK, and is worth one play for the bits.

Then trade it.

RATING: 5
Intriguing first game but next two dragged and felt about 15 minutes too long.  If a steady batch of invention cards don’t come out to acquire and use, there are too many turns with pedestrian choices.  In addition, it seems like the winner will often be determined a few turns before it ends making it feel anticlimactic. Getting stuck without a cave that prevents more purchases of cavemen and then simply collecting food for a few turns can be frustrating.  There are some neat ideas here and I wonder if a clever variant could fix some of the pacing issues.  Component quality and artwork are exceptional for the price.

Really liked this little card game. Almost like a simplified Race for the Galaxy where you're building up your tableau in order to do more and more powerful actions. My wife and son really liked it too. Oh, and the artwork is phenomenal. I really like the clay-mation look of everything. Two thumbs up.

Cute little filler with a lot of theme to throw around for such a small game.  You have two money-ish resources and several virtual resources to manage as you try to build up your tribe of cavemen to kill dinosaurs and invent technologies.  The first one to invent fire wins.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2017)

My desire to play Cavemen was low, but when I read the rules I thought the game could be better than expected. For some reason, I thought the game was very simple, but there is some depth to the game.

The rules are more complex than I initially thought. You can explain them under 12 minutes. Playtime is around 60 minutes, the goal of the game is to invent fire.

The game´s components are ok. The art is pretty good.

The theme is fun, but you don’t feel it too much when you play the game.

Cavemen´s decisions aren’t very complex. Once you understand the rules the game flows very quickly. Players bid to be first (and last) player and then they take actions based on the available pool of cards. The options available are: recruit, hunt, invent, explore or forage. Most actions are only available if the corresponding card is in the pool and the tribe has the ability to execute it. Every round you need to feed your tribe and the feeding phase is harder on the first player. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very complex but they aren’t trivial either. Going first is important to decrease the luck of the draw, that is, it is important to get what you need.
 
Best with 3 players.

On the bad side the game can be very repetitive. 

Bottom line, Caveman is an ok game for casual gamers. I would have loved it when I entered the hobby, but nowadays I crave heavier experiences. I already sold it, but I would play again if requested.

Interesting game. Not sure yet if I like it. Seems like a race to build fire, which it clearly is, but aside from outbidding for the conch on the turn fire comes out, doesn't seem like you can control your ability to win as much as I like in my games. Not fun after all. bummer.

The idea is cool, the artistic approach is appealing, the game works, but something just falls flat. I guess it just drags too long and the end game is slightly too random for what it offers. For me it seems it is best (most strategic) with just 2 players.

I absolutely love this game! Recently played a game where I was behind with nothing but hunters, an elder & tribal leader. Other peeps had the thinkers but no teeth. I kept the conch out of their hands until I managed to get enough inventing points and won because of the 1st & last turn the conch holder has. There is loads to consider when play, not just do I have enough thinkers. I basically won because of my hunters. 

I love to play as a prequel to Stone Age but I think it's way better game. Mostly due to the screw your buddy aspect.

Cavemen shares a lot in common with Evolution, for me. Both games are pretty fun, but I think that they work better as educational tools than a fun activity. I enjoyed Cavemen, though it does run noticeably longer than a game of this weight ought to. If it took 30 minutes or less, this could have some real staying power. I love the little thematic moments of brilliance you can see if you read between the lines though.

This game just wasn't very good. It is pretty much completely tactical, just didn't feel fun, and isn't one I'll try and play again. Maybe other groups would like it, but with both my wife and I not liking it, we know it'll be on the trade pile. The art and pieces though are really cool!

This game has bidding elements and you're managing your own little tableau of cards in front of you, trying to eke out the most beneficial interactions. I'm on the fence on this one, and I think I would have liked it more if it were about 15 minutes shorter. Some great ideas here though--but might have a runaway leader problem. We got mopped up by the leader pretty quickly. I won't be playing this again anytime soon.

You're building up a tableau of people (cards) which each have different values in hunting, foraging and thinking, aiming to be the first person to get to the required thinking value (7 for 4 players). To do that though, you need good hunting and / or foraging to earn you food ... because if you don't have enough food, your guys will start dying, and that's not good. It's a form of balancing resources vs VPs. You also need to get tusks via hunting, because these allow you to compete for turn order, which is important if you want to pick up good guys, as people are acquired from the draft in the middle of the table which gets (mostly) re-set each round. Anyway, it all hung together nicely. There's a fair bit of luck in whether one of your guys die when you go off a hunting, making it a high risk exercise, so there's some judgement to be made on whether the reward is worth the risk. To a large degree you feel like you're making the best of what's presented to you rather than making game-making moves, but that's fine, there's a place for that.

Played once with 2P. Cavemen is a tableau-building game where players recruit cavemen and inventions into their tableau. The aim is to garner enough intelligence by the second time the Fire Invention card appears, and until then players have to feed their cavemen, find new places to live in and so on.

Since I played the 2P game, the auction phase was largely ignored since the choice of cards available was usually not worth the hassle. The only time the choices were interesting was when certain inventions appeared. Luck also has quite a strong influence in the game, as my opponent kept on losing his cavemen in hunts. This impaired his ability to hunt, which in turn led to further starvation and loss of cavemen. This would not have been so severe if this game were short, but our game took almost 45 minutes.

As much as I love the unconventional medium of artwork as well as the components, the gameplay of Cavemen is nothing particularly gripping.

RATING: 3
The art is really fantastic.  It looks great and the pieces are lots of fun.

Sadly, the rest of the game is a dry engine builder that relies on drafting from deck that is entirely shuffled together.  The problem with the game for me is that it expects players to have a certain zen-like approach, where you take turn after turn of effectively doing nothing until the card that you need comes up, then after busting the pace of the game apart with an auction that relies on a low piece count, you hope that you can actually do something to further your position.  The sad truth is that if you never have the opportunity to get a cave you can't win.  In fact, you end up stalling out quickly and you can't really do much of anything.  

The complete unpredictability of the cards might be appealing to some players, but I personally find it frustrating when I take my turn to get a bonus innovation and then never see the card that it applies to.

Playing to lower the odds against the return attack from the food supply can be frustrating as well.  There just aren't enough choices for you to actually plan to synchronize the defense numbers on your cards.  So after a while you don't have much incentive to attack the creatures.  

I just can't help but feel that there is nothing more to this game other than getting caves to up your capacity, and then getting the ideas people to discover fire, the rest is all needless dressing.  So if you never have the opportunity to get a cave, congratulations you never had a chance to win.

Nice litte game, great components and simple, easy to learn rules. Good mix of chance and skill. 

Grade based on one play (3 players), the game did drag on a bit too long and the "cave-problem" noted by other reviewers did strike one of our players. Might revise the grade up or down a notch with further play.

Relatively simple and fun drafting and engine-building game.  Really like the clay artwork.  Winning condition is a bit too random, though.  Would have preferred if we were playing for points, or at least make it more predictable when Fire is coming.  Maybe purposely put it near the end of the deck?

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 3er

Interesting engine-building game where you are trying to build a collection of people and inventions that give you more knowledge, so you can acquire FIRE and win the game. It's got that familiar feel of building your display up to provide basic needs (food for your people, teeth so you can bid for Conch), then shifting towards knowledge for the win. I'd like to play this some more!

Each player starts with a cave (allowing 4 people in your display), an elder, and a hunter. People in the game provide you with some number of hides (used for hunting), knowledge (used to acquire inventions), and apples (to collect food), feet (to get caves). There are 2 currencies, food and teeth, which you acquire mostly by hunting; start with several of each. 

Each round, place n+5 cards in display. Players bid for the Conch using teeth; winner pays 1 food per person, others pay 1 food total. Anyone who can't pay fully pays nothing; instead, kill one person. Starting with Conch player, take 1 action each; then Conch takes another action. Choices are:
- hunt dino in display (need requisite hides in your display; collect teeth and/or food shown on dino, then reveal top card from deck -- if any of your people have a symbol matching that on the card, kill one person)
- recruit person: if you have space, and can pay cost, add it to your display
- forage: collect 1 food per apple icon on all your cards
- invent: if your people have enough knowledge, take an invention from display (to take Fire, need to have Conch and have a bunch of knowledge, depending on player count; you win the game)

At end of round, the last player discards cards from display until there are only 3 left; if Fire discarded, shuffle it back into the deck (after first time through the deck, though, Fire remains on display). Pass the Conch left, then repeat above.

While we were still playing in the Stone Age, we decided to try this game. Never heard of it, but the boxart was nice. The story on the back didn’t sound too bad. Start to read the rules and after that playing. The rules are pretty easy and could be explained by an experienced explainer in about 5 minutes. Goal of the game is to invent fire. To do that, you’ll need 10 ideas. Each player starts to bid on the start player token. This might not sound too interesting, but you’ll have to keep in mind, that the starting player gets one more turn each round. The drawback on being the starting player is, that he has to feed all of his cavemen with on food, while the other players have to pay one food for all of their cavemen.

This game was a big surprise. We expected nothing of it, and it turned out to be a fun game. And the artwork is just fantastic. The cards are pictures from clay-models. Very nicely done. Biggest disadvantage of it, is the availability in Europa. To be short. It’s very hard to find a copy of it. Maybe in October at Spiel we manage to find one.

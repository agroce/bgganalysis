Jigsaw-type game tiles are horrible. Some graphics and/or wording are cut off and not complete depending on how you connect the tiles. Standard squares are better.

Now, after a long time, they FINALLY finished the rule book!! CONGRATS!!! Now I have to pay to get the one that was supposed to be released with the game long ago! Yet another company who relies on the 21st Century to take their sweet time!

RATING: 3
Great components, nice theme, excellent idea and orientation (survival instead of fighting), but the game really looks like in beta. So many things don't make sense and are counter-intuitive. 
What could have been great is only a bunch of random and/or useless stuff. Scavenge is pure uninteresting randomness, buildings are useless, finding stuff in places is completely broken, there's a real lack of zombies in the box, equip management is overcomplicated for nothing, double zombies just don't make any sense at all, all the weapons look simply the same, really bad balance between survivors, and the list goes on. 

Not only those issues are not addressed, but the game was not yet shipped to the backers that another kickstarter was out, with a lot of confusing new stuff. Zemergency make you feel like they split the base game to sell it different parts, for example (why is the "fast game variant" not in a base game?) . Really deceiving game with a really BIG potential and gorgeous components (lack of zombies apart). 

For a survival experience, i prefer zombie survival: the board Game. Even if far from excellent, it gives you a feeling of survival and stuff management. Even the simplest "shopping in town" rules are more enjoyable than scavenging and finding stuff in Zpocalypse because at least you have some choices and "push your luck" mechanisms.

IMHO the best zombie themed BG ever. Let's see what "Zombicide: Black Plague" has to subtend.

RATING: N/A
Mechanically? Its a bit cumbersome.  Story telling potential? leaps and bounds over other zombie games such as last night on earth.  This game is cruel, unforgiving and quite literally unfair.  Then again... isn't that exactly what a zombie apocalypse would be like?

In the end you may get screwed by dice, cards, characters, etc but there will be a great story to tell when its all over.

RATING: 5
Componentes aceptables (las minis un poco cutres). Temáticamente hay demasiadas cosas que no tienen sentido

Por ejemplo: ¿Que sentido tiene una fase de saqueo en la que los personajes se alejan kilómetros del refugio para buscar recursos si alrededor del mismo solo han explorado dos secciones de 8x8 metros? (Y encima esas secciones poseen recursos saqueables!!)

Hay una fase de crear barricadas, trampas, levantar muros, construir puertas... Exceptuando las trampas el resto de obstáculos tienen una utilidad casi nula. ¿Qué sentido tiene gastar recursos para construir un muro que los zombis derriban en DOS turnos?. Una barricada no cuesta recursos y los ralentiza UN turno. 

Y podría seguir...

En definitiva. El juego es una colección de buenas ideas que, por separado, pueden parecer interesantes, divertidas o incluso brillantes. Desgraciadamente una vez puestas en la mesa, resultan en mecánicas farragosas, reglas innecesarias y, en muchos casos, partidas aburridas. 

Solo recomendado para los muy amantes del género. Para el resto de mortales resultará ser un juego tedioso, innecesariamente complejo y bastante aburrido. 

Y aun asi... A mi me gusta!!!

I do not have my con plays in here as yet nor my non con plays I will at another time. This is my Zombie game of choice, I like what is going on here, and there is a lot! I like that a system can have this many moving parts that all come together to make a difference and not feel like chrome that was tacked on. It is fiddly, but I have long known that Fiddly can be not just good but very good or even great, here it excels that's for sure. The additional private objectives are a nice touch and the over all brutality of the games set up and play makes it an affair you have to prepare for mentally, the beat down IS coming, its just when and how bad. This game takes you into the world it is trying to depict, your time there is largely up to you and the whims of the others trying to survive. It makes this one fun and also a bit unpredictable, I thought I would not like this in the long term, but have found it to be very refreshing and sets up some truly memorable narratives for this one.

RATING: 5
Zpocalypse is fun, but it is really really finicky, and after all is said and done, there is not much to it.  I enjoy the variety of playing with different survivors and different weapons.  It does feel like a fun post apocalyptic adventure.  However, no matter how shiny Zpoc is on the outside, one is still left with the notion that there just isn't very much under the hood.  I will keep it, though, as I don't have many games like it in my collection and it scratches a certain itch.  However, if I acquire more games like it in the future, this one may make its way into the trade pile.

I think this is a really good game. It's different from the others out on the market in the fact that it's not completely about fighting zombies- that's there and it's important not to let them get to the bunker, but the real fun and strategy of the game is in the other phases of the "day"- we really had to work together and figure out ways to funnel the zombies into areas we wanted them- even if it meant using each other as "bait"- the "fortifications" are also really important - for the group I play in, this will go up in rating with more plays and the added expansions!

This game is a real abomination, a veritable Frankenstein's monster of mechanics, slapped together in the most convoluted way possible.

The rules are horrible. The board is too crowdy. Gameplay is flawed: Intelligence (or what it´s called) is overpowered, and there´s also this loophole in the rules that you can lure the last zombie away from the others to give them time to search. If you want a zombie slayer, go with Zombicide, if you want something with more storytelling, try Last Night on Earth. Just stay away from this!

RATING: 5
Game does a good job of the relentless push of zombies trying to suck out your brains, but repeated plays feel exactly the same. Survivors are too tongue-in-cheek.  Would not get enough plays with my wife or gaming group to justify keeping.  Don't regret Kickstarting it, as Greenbrier Games was the most connected to its backers I've ever experienced with Kickstarter.

Simultaneously horrifying and hilarious, this game has it all: theme galore, pre-combat strategy, tense tactical decisions, campy scenarios and objectives, and yes, zombies. What else could you ask for? 

One big criticism has to do with the rules: the event cards are often hard to interpret and the rulebook is pretty bad, especially if you have to look something up during play. The first turn can also drag before all the fun begins during the night combat phase, but it does lend an "RPG feel" to the game that few other boardgames have. Zombicide and Dark Darker Darkest are giving this a run for its money, but I still think this is one of the better zombie games out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The main way to sum up my view of this game thus far is "interesting".  The game is on the medium/heavy side and can definitely be a bit fiddly with all of the tokens, tiles, miniatures, and dials that need to be continually adjusted.  Some of the core mechanics of the game seem rather strong if unrefined.  

The intriguing multi-phase turn is what I find the most enjoyable and perhaps the most frustrating.  The Scavenge phase has you drawing a card and then rolling some dice to determine if you recruit a new survivor, if you scrounge up some equipment, or if you get into trouble.  There is a great variability in the results here and a bad roll can really set you back.  This wouldn't be a big problem if you were playing the game as a Coop but the main format of the game is a semi-Cooperative mode where there is one winner (which really interests my group in theory).

The Feed and Fortify phase is a bit more solid as you spend action points and supplies to bulk up your base's defenses.  I really need to get more experience with the game to determine how much depth/cleverness can be attained in obstacle placement.  Feeding is straight forward as you are taxed resources to sustain your party members.

The Something's Happening phase is next which sparks the spawning of additional zombies and adding more tiles to the map along with a narrative event of sorts.  This event affects everyone equally so the randomness is not as big of a deal.

The final phase involves combat as you fight the Zeds until either your group perishes or their group does.  It seems to me this phase would have benefitted from a timer of sorts.  Maybe hold them off for so many rounds until some form of help arrives.  Narratively justifying that may be a bit difficult (if the army comes on the 1st night then why are we still in trouble on the second night?), but it would likely have improved the game by making it more tense (wave after wave until help arrives.  Perhaps making the Zombies retreat during the day (kind of like the Vampires in "I am Legend" maybe).  

Combat itself is OK and nothing special.  You run around the map trying to make best use of your obstacles and protect the bunker.

Played this at Gen Con. Thought it was a pretty polished game with well defined rules.

Game play is a little complex at first but once you play through a couple turns it picks up and goes a lot quicker.

First off the rule book is atrocious. It is disjointed and not direct at all. I still don't know if I am playing correct. The double sided tiles are terrible. I put them in a draw bag and randomly drew them. They way the tiles interlock they can only be played 1 side up anyways... Why are they double sided? I'm not impressed with this game at all...(did I play it correctly?) The rules are that bad. I even watched the video clips from bgg, it helped with the rules a little bit, but it was still a confusing mess. I'm gaming tomorrow with some friends...this game is staying home. Maybe I'll try it again later, but as of now. It is a confusing mess.

Read the rules again and played with a friend still bad, did I play it correctly? I feel that there could be a decent game here but the rules are a smoke screen and so far it is not worth the money. Bad investment. Do not buy until the rules are fixed.

out of my collection.

Fills a particular niche in the zombie game genre. Parts of it remind me of Betrayal at House on the Hill, Dead of Winter, Dead Panic. 

Pros:
* Quirky theme - some amusing goal/event cards
* Art is nice but some of the symbology on tiles could have been better (some of the no enter symbols are virtually invisible in the art)

Cons:
* Minis aren't great - a lot of leaning
* The squad minis are pretty terrible - the colored stand you put them on is poor - they don't stay on well. Much prefer other games where you have unique survivors. Failing that, would have just preferred identical but differently colored "squad" minis (with like 4 generic people on them.
* Would have preferred more companion survivors - like Princess
* The included manual is pretty awful - consult the 4.2 manual on the Greenbrier site - even then, had a number of questions. There's a fair number of nit-picky rules.
* Would have liked better mechanics for zombie movement (a player aid app might be nice)
* Game feels overly long
* Takes up a lot of space
* Games can swing a lot - a bad run of dice throwing one hour in, and you can get slaughtered

Also got the Zpocalypse Adapter Tile Set 2.0 - would rate it also 4.5 - it is fine but not necessary (and doesn't add a whole lot to the base game)

They tried, it doesn't work. What would have been better is just focusing on the tower defense aspect and ditch the scavenging. The having to rebuild the base after a few nights wrecks any sense of build up and eliminates the need for the first half of the game.

the best zombie game I have played as of yet. this seemed really allows you to get the feel of the apocalyptic environment that you have been placed into. The story is amazing and the mechanics are well thought out. It is more based on strategy but I would like a little bit more meat on the bone. the main objective is to survive fortnights but there is a victory points system that is somehow a bit neglected. it is almost like this theme makes you want to ignore the victory points and focus on surviving which is a good thing but makes it a little dry on the strategy side. I would recommend this game if you are a zombie fan and are looking for something that is more than just move your piece on the map and collect stuff and shoot zombies.best part is setting traps and barricades. Good fun

Everyone you knew and loved is a zombie hungering for your flesh.  You're with a group of other survivors, but you don't trust them.  Maybe you should wait until they have killed their share of zombies, and then go ahead and finish them off before they can betray you?

This game is amazing. The creators are constantly updating and integrating feedback given to them by players and critics.  It's really not fair how the early versions of this game are rated so poorly and I strongly recommend those who have played the unpolished "vanilla" version give this game another shot (and new rating). For those who still claim this game to be "too complicated" at this point should probably stick to tiddly-winks or Candyland. There's nothing complicated or difficult to understand here.

I played a demo of an early version of the game at TotalCon. We just played the first day. I was killed, but only because I wasn't cautious and just rushed into danger to see what would happen.

It's hard to judge it based on one partial play. It seems well designed. They obviously put a lot of work into the game mechanics, artwork, and flavor text.

The rules are a little complex for a zombie game. I think it would take a while to get comfortable with the rules if one of the game developers hadn't been explaining it to us.

It seemed oddly easy to avoid zombies if you wanted to. We all left the bunker and many of the zombies went into the bunker. We could wander around and search all day if we wanted to. Of course eventually you have to go fight them all at once, but there was no feeling of urgency.

Update: The designer contacted me through the Geek, and they're working on solving the problem of players "farming" while the zombies chill in the bunker. That should help. He also pointed out that the rulebook will have QR codes (and web links) that point to videos that explain the rules on each page. That's pretty cool.

If ever a rulebook made too much use of icons and could use a lesson in English grammar and punctuation, this one is it. Despite three of us looking at the book we could not agree on how to make an attack. we actually came up with at least 2 variations each. I think there is a decent game in here somewhere, but its hard to see for the ambiguity the language used in the rulebook leaves the reader with.

Most questions have been answered by browsing the Geek though.

There is a lot of moving parts to this game. From what I can tell of Zombicide this game does not seem as streamlined or intuitive. Players draw cards from stacks of different piles and fortify their bunker to survive so many days, and then attack zombies as they make their way into the bunker. I'm not the biggest fan of semi-cooperative "best player" wins games, and I don't believe this particular game would change my opinion. The Zmaster expansion adds a fifth player that controls the zombies, which adds some depth/strategy to the game.

Fun game, but much darker side to the Zombie theme. Have to protect your bunker, and rescue and keep survivors alive. Does not suffer from player elimination, but has a less thematic "horde" feel. 

Zpocalypse is a survival board game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Two to four players start in a basement/fallout shelter which can lead out to several base locations or even through the tunnels to sewer grates throughout the transformable board. The survivors are trying to make it day to day in a world torn apart from the walking dead.

As in any survival game, one needs food, guns, ammo, and more. Players go out into the wasteland and scavenge for supplies, or perhaps to find a new gun or melee weapon to fend off the next zombie attack. In addition to gathering supplies, each player forms and controls his own squad – and each squad works to fortify the bases. Your walls and barbed wire won’t hold the dead for long, however, and they’re getting hungry.

Got into that second Kickstarter, SO much better than Zombicide, much deeper.

Though, when I want to play with miniatures tactics, I really want to play Heavy Gear or Mercs, or even Mage Knight with Nick, and with other sorts of friends we'd prefer less move and roll games and more abstract ones.

Was hoping to paint this, buuut....I have so much HG stuff to do in the first place.  Keeping the bonus zombie horde box and hospital zombies, because maybe one day I'll paint them and/or use them in an RPG, but everything else found a better home.

Traded with everything else sans Zmaster for Archipelago and its Solo Expansion.

This semi-coop zombie games showed much promise on Kickstarter but was a complete disaster. The rulebook is abysmal leaving more questions than providing answers. The resource management part is almost non-existant, I'm glad I could get rid of this to recoup on my purchase.

An unfortunately lackluster game with an excellent idea. I have finally admitted to myself that this game is my biggest Kickstarter disappointment up to date. 

The theme is spot on and everything except combat works really well. However combat takes the majority of they playing time and is quite clunky. The game is far from bad, but it can't be rated very highly either.

Rulebook is not very good at all, glossing information or missing vital information to help us get off the ground, this had an effect on our gameplay as we weren't sure on specific aspects.

I do like the theme for scavenging, and the daily optional goals is always a treat. Could be planned out a lot better, but I believe it has potential.

RATING: N/A
Immediate thoughts after just one play so opinions can still be switched entirely/changed yet- clunky, aggressively ambiguous zombie game. Like Zombies!!! if it was on a grander, more complex style.

Horribly messy tiles that make spotting obstacles, item pick ups, and even spaces and wall boundaries difficult to spot!

Not enough Zombies miniatures by a long shot- in both zombie spawns we completely cleared the stock and wound up short, meaning not only not enough to place but we had to put out all the 'double zombies' out too and were still short.

No specifications for movement, line of sight, zombie movement and behaviour- Zombies can uncomfortably move diagonally, allowing them to close the gap in a move and diagonally sidestep over barricades making them useless.

Cooperation game but not encouraged as 'there can only be one winner'- always a bit of a stinker, its either all for one or every man for himself, pick one!

And last but not least is combat- do the survivors attack together? separate? do they roll dice each and then combine their attacks to total all adjacent zombies or do they only hit one as a group at a time. Can you see over wall lines from a watch tower? How come zombies aren't stopped by hindering terrain?

Like I say, far too vague with no specifics, reminds me of Zombies!!!

It tries hard, but falls short of it's potential.

Finally got my Kickstarter copy and was severely disappointed. No one enjoyed it and I felt bad for bringing it to the table. It was the first game we've ever quit before completing.

Problems with the game, IMO:

Rulebook:

The rulebook is terrible. It is poorly laid out and hard to follow. There are spelling mistakes (very few, but enough that we took notice) and misprintings of diagrams. Or, if they weren't misprintings, then the diagrams were so complex that we couldn't understand them. Either way, that's a failure of a rulebook.

The rulebook also doesn't explain everything you need to play the game. I still don't understand how combat works. We all passed the rulebook around to try to figure it out and I think we were playing correctly, but it still felt "off." So either the rulebook is terrible at explaining a fundamental aspect of the game, or the mechanic is poorly designed, or both.

Rules:

This game is the definition of "fiddly".

The rules are incredibly complex for the amount of gameplay and strategy that they provide. Having to feed your survivors, get equipment to reload guns and make fortifications, "merging" zombies, having different rules for the same icon depending on circumstances (yellow arrow on board vs yellow arrow on sandbags), remembering what all the traps/structures do, managing the combined health and armor, but separate speed and brains, but combined skills but they don't decrease but remembering if someone leaves and then the same person comes back that it doesn't increase again, what is the purpose of radioactive food? does a single person eat it?, can a single person die? you're all just like one huge mass. WTF is going on?!

Why can zombies move diagonally? That is just incredibly broken, they cover half the map in a single turn and swarm you in seconds. Fine if that's the type of zombies you're going for, but not if players are poorly equipped and can, at best, take down one or two a turn.

Components:

The miniatures are feel incredibly cheap and poorly made. Like something you'd find a bag of in a $.99-cent store.

There aren't *nearly* enough zombies. This would be an ironic "the miniatures suck and there weren't enough of them" paradox if it weren't for that fact that you need them to play the game. We had to go back and merge already placed zombies into the "double" zombie miniature in order to place out new zombies, which means we basically have to fight a harder enemy because the game doesn't provide enough miniatures.

The cards are thin, but they are nice and actually seem pretty high-quality. I'm on the fence on this one. I'll put it in the plus column.

The dials for armor and health are on top of one another and moving one moves the other. So you have to remember to press them together when you move them or you'll screw up your stats.

Summary:

I was going to go on, but I'll stop here. This game is just bad. I WANT to like it. But sitting around going "what do we do now?", "how does that work again?", "does this give you points?", "I don't get how this works.", "Can I move here?", etc, etc, etc -- is not fun. At all.

Pretty fun, probably best of the Zombie Horde games out there. Some problems with the first draft of the rulebook but they're working on a revision that should clear up a lot of vagueness.

REVISED DOWN. Four-player game sucked pretty bad. Just one very, very long dice-fest on par with Zombies!!!, plus some interesting survival-themed stuff leading up to the dicefest. Cannot recommend.

Awesome components let down by a game system that is too bereft of interesting decision making to warrant deep replay. The caveat is I've only played the basic scenario, but glancing through the others didn't fill me with any desire to explore. You have a team of survivors who'll each have a combat card. The zombies will be arrayed outside the bunker. After some team mgt stuff, you take turns moving and blasting any and all zombies within range, which is simply a matter of rolling well. Arrange to get to a spot that won't be surrounded by zombies (as they'll all move closer after a combat round), and then blast the next batch all over again. Repeat until they all die. And then, instead of letting the game come to a natural conclusion with their collective death, re-set the board and repeat exactly the same process for another round (or more), effectively playing the same game again each round. Unfortunately it's mostly mindless for the heroes and you may start turning into a zombie yourself when the game starts going too long. There's just too few (any?) clever things to do throughout. Great components, shame about the game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I've played this once and the risk is it's never gonna be played again. We didn't find any strategy at all in the game. Draw random cards. Roll dice to see the outcome of the cards. Roll dice back and forth until the zombies died. that's it. 

The "survivors" have armor that absorbs most (or all) of the damage so it's easy to put your back against a corner and hope to be assaulted by as many zombies as possible, since they can't hurt you and you score points for every kill. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
8 Plays - Though not amazing, this game is constantly putting you in awesome, yet grisly situations. A lot of people hate on this game for its lack of rule clarifications etc. It really is a sandbox game for those who are happy to adapt their own house rules and scenarios (often mid game too lol). Once I got over the rule ambiguity, I actually had a lot of fun playing it. We even changed some of the weapon card's rules to increase their usability/ fun level. I started writing non-linear scenarios and playing it like an RPG.  To enjoy this, you also have to accept that some games you play will end rather quickly and perhaps anti-climatically... as you will DIE! Death is always knocking in this game, and its part of the fun... if a 2hr game that suddenly ends after 10mins because of bad luck is not for you, avoid this game.

Game is a ton of fun to play, feels like you're actually trying to SURVIVE, not just kill a bunch of zombies.  Scavenge cards have a little bit of storytelling and they're enjoyable to read.  I'd say the game is part tower defense, part suicide mission.  You won't win most scenarios, but its fun until you get eaten.

Just a little too amateurish in almost every aspect. Lots of rules and a horrible rule book for little payoff/fun. Advertised "Coop" is inexistent and the grenade is just an awful kingmaker.

One of my first kickstarters, so I want to love this game quite badly. I've played it twice and both times have been interesting and enjoyable, but it's hard to really get a good feel for the game without a couple more plays. The art is very unique but it is maddeningly busy in my opinion which hurts the game. Lots of great, fun components though and tons of replayability with all the different scenarios, characters, etc.

Rules as written, this is a broken pointless game. Finally survived the rulebook in order to play this. I see potential in this game, but it is abysmally made. Some playtesting would have done them worlds of good.

Felt a lot like a game trying to bite a chunk out of the zombie craze. It misses the mark in a lot of ways though. It's a little "too" in depth for what it is.

Once we had a full grasp of the rules, and they aren’t as complicated as the rulebook makes them out to be, we had a blast killing zombies trying to survive the night! We actually had a true sense of trying to survive a zombie apocalypse while playing, and that’s exactly what I wanted out of Zpocalypse. The theme is great and all the pieces and map tiles add to the theme to make it a very solid Zombie game!

Flawed, klunky, yet, a great experience. 3 is a good number. Has a tendency to go sloooooow with new players. Problem with it is, all the text are well written and thematic, yet, if u took turns and waited for everyone to read the text of all the cards, everyone is just sitting there waiting... If undidnt read the text and just applied the icon actions, u loose half the theme. 

A good 2 player game though. Great effort for a first game. 

After playing this again between a 3 month break, it suddenly appears HIGHLY unreplayable and repetitetive. Someone has removed my zombie goggles. How did I even stand this pc of junk? Sheesh...

RATING: 6
The makings of a great game are apparent upon first play, however the game quickly degenerates into a painful clutter of cumbersome, unclear rules and a combat phase that stays long past its welcome. Maybe the FAQ fixes things. I will never know. 

The game attempts to be more than just a dice-fest, which is apparent in the rather enjoyable first 3 phases where players attempt to prepare for the freaky night ahead. However, once night hits and combat phase occurs...that's where the game falls to pieces, in my humble opinion. Firstly, it is rather impossible to win, so much so that you might not even both playing. The map is painful to read and navigate...and hideous when put together (just use SQUARE TILES...no need for the stupid jigsaw teeth that force people to play either A or B side exclusively). And combat is unexciting and skewed towards the zombies. 

Not a bad first attempt but Last Night on Earth and Zombicides do it much more cleanly.

I haven't tried this with actual people yet, but my solo attempts that were dedicated to figuring out the rules make me believe that this is not a good game.

RATING: 8.5
This review is based on one two player game.
I am rating this high for multiple reasons:

1. Zombies are not really in my sphere d'geek, but this game really sucks you into a post apocalyptic world. The art and the mechanics work so well together that you actually feel nervous and are constantly thinking about how you will survive. That's a huge thumbs up. And the fact that it conveys the theme so well make it a no-brainer purchase.
2. You can incorporate roleplaying, or not. Although this is a board game that you can play just as a board game. There is a ton of flavor text, and you can easily incorporate roleplaying into your sessions. When you do, it takes the game to a whole new level. It feels natural to do so, and no new rules or complicated reference books are required.
3. It is COOPERATIVE and COMPETITIVE at the same time. You NEED the other players if you hope to survive, but you are also competing for resources and victory points. It feels just as I imagine it would in a real zombie apocalypse. You  would desperately seek out help, but when it came down to saving yourself at the expense of others, what would you do it? You'll be faced with these tough decisions in Zpocalypse.
4. It's fun


Now this is Greenbriar's first game so it's not perfect, but any issues I have are minor.
It is pretty fiddly. There are tons of cards, tokens, tiles, dice and of course the miniatures you are constantly have to deal with. This is not a huge issue because most of them are fun to reveal and use. I personally would have liked it if items and food were on tokens as it would have saved space. But again, this is minor, just make sure you have a large table.
The rulebook, although thorough, does have some minor typos, and could be laid out better. I understand that it's difficult to organize a rulebook for a game of this scope, so it gets a pass. But it will take a few read throughs to understand it all. On the positive side, the rulebook includes QR codes that you can scan which will take you to an explanation video. That was very nice.

This game really surprised me. When I saw it on Kickstarter I thought, "oh, another zombie game". But it's fun, fun, fun. And the theme is so well executed that I feel the need to thoroughly wash my hand every time I touch the box.

Seek this one out and play it.

fun; tactical; nicely thematic (can be overly very wordy at times though) - lots to read; nice pieces/cards; takes quite a while to finish ([u]double[/u] the suggested box time [u]at least[/u], unless you've played it quite a lot) because you're constantly fretting over many decisions that have to be made and kept track of; does not play like most zombie games out there; in this one you feel like you're the director of an overall movie (like the entire Walking Dead series and other series/movies in a nutshell), with lots weird side challenges and stuff that you can choose to do to impact players differently (hey... no one said that everything that survivors do in the zombie apocalypse was sane!); as a player you play a squad of characters which make up your team and account for your overall combined stats - as characters die you subtract from those stats until you hit zero life points and die - then if you cannot recruit any more characters to your squad and the zombies take over the main bunker...you as a player die, and the overall game ends if the other players are in the same situation;  can be played [b]co-op[/b] for pure survival mode, [b]semi-co-op[/b] for survival plus best player mode, [b]competitive[/b] for getting the most points before the game ends and shafting the other players at the best opportunities --- but whichever version you play should be agreed upon by all players ahead of time; the game gets crazy hard as it goes on over a period of 4 days (full rounds of play), but can also be modified for harder and easier game play without difficulty; good depth of game play; I'm very much looking forward to the multi-player experience; this game reminds me of a sort of pure zombie style Arkham Horror experience in a lot of ways with a high focus on fortress defense

I got to play this at BGG.CON and chat with the designer and it was a fun game.

There are A LOT of rules and setup to the game but it's also offers A LOT of customization.  A lot of games say they let you play the way you want to play, but this one actually delivers on that promise.  You can Rambo your way through zombies in one scenario, scavenge for resources in another, or stealth through an entire city.  It's really up to the players what scenario they want to play that game.

My biggest criticism is there's just a lot to the game and that just comes with all the customization.  You have an experience track for your group which turns some wheels on your player board which affects your weapon cards.  It's a lot to deal with.

Still though, fun game.

Rulebook is rich with examples but poor on overview.  Most issues I ran into could be resolved by reading carefully.  The game itself is pretty fun and thematic, but can be unforgiving of poor dice rolls.  Will play if in the right mood.

I never figured out why people like Zombicide more than this game. All I could think of was,  they never looked through all the scenarios. There is one that makes gameplay a lot like Zombicide. But I appreciate the added complexity of it all. it can be a quick "head count" type or epic survival. This is the Kickstarter edition. It came with the prototype/barebones version of Z-Mergency and some other extras and promo cards.

first stab was pretty okay.  it's a lot to take in, but the rules (although dense) are fairly clear.  the flavor text is good, and there were no major problems with the game play.  handling the movement of 20-30 zombies was a bit of a problem though, especially with lots of sand bags and other obstacles.

This was a peer pressure buy. :)

I don't particularly care for the artistic style of this game, but some of its design goals did sound interesting, but I didn't like what the rules and their presentation, so I quickly found another person that wanted the game and sold them my complete set.

Zpocalypse BUNDLE. Played once. All components accounted for and in superb condition. One of the zombie figures had some paint applied to it. No expansion boxes included. Everything is in the base game box.

Includes:
* Base Game 
* ZMergency Expansion
* ZMaster Expansion
* Fortifications Pack 
* ZMergency Hospital Horde

Played near production demo at gencon 2012.  Seems like a deeper last night on earth with more story and actual cool leveling up.  It didnt blow me awsy but i really enjoyed playing and look forward to trying actual scenerios w my kickstarter copy.

I need to give this one a few more plays before I render a final verdict - particularly after giving the revised rules a chance.

Play testing is coming along. Still have a bit to iron out. But nothing we can't handle.

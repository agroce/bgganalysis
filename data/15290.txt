One of the favourites of my Secret Santa 2009. I love this game soooo much now, and it's the game I used to introduced a newbie into gaming and she got hooked after playing R-Eco!! THANK YOU SO MUCH again Santa!! Bless your kind soul. This game is a fantastic filler! http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/48431/item/1149407#item1149407

R-Eco is a keeper. I like simple card games but usually don't want to play them more than once. With R-Eco I could foresee playing it repeatedly and still enjoying it. I need to locate a copy so I can make that a reality.

RATING: 4
R-Eco in a nutshell: Play cards – Score points – Take cards – Check hand limit – Repeat. There are no special powers or rule breaking situations. You only care about the colour of the cards and how many of them you have. Very simple. Very straightforward. Very short life expectancy. R-Eco is purely tactical and there is no strategic level (or it is ultra thin at best).  Decisions are quite easy most of the time since a bad move at one point usually does not reward you later or vice versa. Passable as past time activity but not very rewarding as a game.

Whilst I am a sucker for a good short filler and thought this was ok, I wasn't bowled over by it.  For instance, I'd much sooner play Geschenkt or Lascaux.  Even so, this isn't a bad game and I'd gladly play it when offered as a filler.  Card quality ain't good and you are a bit limited by hand size, but there was enough to keep me interested.

*2-5 Players

The game becomes more fun as you play more of it.  We play this during lunch. It's not very tense, not a brain burner, perfect for a relax time game.  The most tension part is when the chips are "-2" and not many wants to take it.  One fun part is when you have 3 cards at the top of all stack, forcing the next player to do illegal dump it's funny.  Overall, this is a "happy" game!  

Only concern I have with this game is that you need to draw cards every turn, and you need to shuffle a lot!  It's best if we have 1 dedicated person to hand out card, it's a lot faster!

Very well thought little card game in which hand management of the maximum number of cards in your hand plays a major role.  Quite a lot of opportunism, increasing with more players. It plays actually a bit tricky, and may take some turns to really notice how many cards you will get after playing your future turns.  30 minutes filler really worth playing, very portable, and with appropriate cartoony graphics.

> check out our 2 player variant in the variant rules section! <

I'm sure that one more pun about this being a "filler", will truly push that joke over its tipping point, but it is quite easy to echo the general sentiment that immediately follows it. That as far as card game fillers go, this is one of the better ones.

It is in the 6 Nimmt and Hornochsen tradition; players play cards from their hand onto a communal area, and through deft hand-manipulation try to pounce on victory points when left available, or force other players into picking up penalty points by leaving them no attractive alternative. What makes it stand out, and outstanding, is that it has added an extra dimension to your placement considerations. Each of the four factories are seeded with a "redraw" set of between one and four random cards (of any colour). A factory that is close to accepting another delivery, will have many cards in this set. A factory that just had one, will have only one. So placement and scoring considerations also have to be weighted against the immediate consequences for your hand-composition for the next turn(s), and possibly penalty points for overshooting your maximum hand-size.

It is a lovely complication. An added layer, that can be manipulated by skilful players, to set up some thoroughly challenging dilemmas for the person they hand the turn over to. And that is where the real strategists can eat their heart out, and why this game is one of those fillers that does far more than just pass a pleasant half hour: there is quite a bit more under the bonnet than you might pick up during your initial games. The obvious plays aren't always the better ones. Far from it. Timing is key, and to take charge of timing, you need some sound hand-management. Skill can force other players to march to a beat that benefits you, and although it has a fair share of random card-flipping, since redraw options are always exposed, and you probably have a fair idea what people are playing for, you might not be able to control what type of cards you will make available to them, you have a fair amount of influence on making options more or less attractive. If you managed your own hand well.

The more players participate, the less likely are you to reap the rewards of the problems you set up for others, and if I have one criticism, is that 5 might be a bit much if you like a bit more personal payback for being clever and blocking someone else. Also, when the juicy reward cards get exposed, piles can suddenly run out before you get your turn back. It often only takes 2 people who have been hoarding for the colour they had invested in, to end the game, and with 5 players, there are usually 2 people doing that for the pile that is running low already. Although I appreciate an element of uncertainty and chaos, when less people participate, you regain more control over proceedings, and to me it improves the overall balance here, and makes it a better game. I am very keen to try the 2-player variant published here.

It isn't a perfect game, nor is it a game that should be taken far more serious than an entertaining filler, decent as it is. But somehow it has found that sweet spot that makes it attractive to players of various abilities. That magic space where things are simple, fun, fast and light-hearted, yet offer meaningful challenges, more strategies than you would expect, and an internal balance that keeps chaos well within controllable fences. There aren't many games that manage to pull that off. If you are gonna separate the trash from the bits worth keeping, this goes onto the "seriously good" pile.  Garbage it ain't.

I'm always looking for new games that play in a short timeframe.  My family game nights often are only a few hours and therefore we will frequently just fill that time with a bunch of shorter games rather than playing one long game.  So when I heard about R-Eco it was an obvious addition to my collection.  And, sure enough, it lives up to the hype because it offers genuinely interesting decisions, but in a very short amount of time.  The mechanisms take a couple turns for non-gamers to get comfortable with, but after that it's pretty simple.

What I like is that I actually find myself really thinking and planning every single turn.  This isn't just a mindless time-killer, this is a nice strategic game that just happens to be quick.  However there is one complaint I would have to make.  It seems that, especially towards the end of the game, the best play on your turn becomes calculable.  As a result, people will stop playing at a fast pace and they will just freeze up in thought trying to do the math and figure out which option will benefit them the most.  This kind of stop in the action feels very out of place in a game that should be light and easy.  Aside from that I find this to be a great game, and I expect it to hit the table many times in the future.

Clever card game with a tricky mechanism that slaps your hand when you get too greedy. Nicely produced too. Not sure about long term replayability but that isn't really the point with this sort of game. It is another great card game which is maybe the second step into gaming for non-gamers.

Accessible and clever filler that I wont request but would play again. Set collection. So you are trying to manage your hand with a size limit and place your opponents in an uncomfortable position while dealing with the lack of control over what turns up on the table.

An excellent filler style game.  This plays quickly and intelligently, I like the card interplay, and the spread of scoring tokens players compete for during the game.  The tough choices of whether to play a card or cards in order to get a scoring token or rubbish cards, ot whether to play a card to wait and see whether someone else helps you out a little is a real pleasure.  The game plays quickly, is simple enough to grasp quickly (although the skill of looking at what cards you want to pick up and playing for both those and scoring tokens takes a half to a full game to grasp fully).  This is a great filler, between No Thanks!, Fairy Tale and this game, Z-Man have a winning set of filler style cards games.

This is a real gem!

The recycling theme of this is what compelled me to buy it, and it is cute, if not terribly convincing. I must say it's a fun little filler, and lasts just as long as you'd want it to.

But it should last a long time. Oh and the rules sheet is way too small!

I heard about this via the bookshelf gamer video review, and I bought it as a good portable filler game. Also since most of my games are ameri-trash or euro games, I wanted to pick up some games by a Japanese designer, like this one and Fairy Tale. R-Eco is an enjoyable and easy to teach the game. While the concept of recycling garbage might not sound appealing, it works thematically with the concept of picking up garbage (cards) and laying them off (discarding cards) and I imagine if teaching to kids, the theme is a good learning lesson. Games go quick and has a definite "take-that" factor. I've only played 2 player games so far so I'd be curious how it plays with more.

Relatively simple card-game centering on hand-management and timing. You want to snatch up R-Eco cards while keeping your hand as slim, yet as potentially potent, as possible.

This game feels like it's all strategy, to the point that the fun has been sucked out of it.

Play cards to a recycling center, then take your truck around to pick up more cards from the dump.  Hold too many cards and you have to dump your cards illegally.  Eventually you recycle enough to gain a point token, but you need more than one of a color to even score.  And watch out for those negative 2s!

Interesting idea with a pasted-on theme, but it was too dry and boring for me.

A little card game that reminded me of some of Michael Schacht's designs.  In this one you're supplying factories with goods and taking their garbage, hoping to reuse the garbage as goods for another factory.  Factories award bonuses when they finish a project.  But players have limited capacity, and any excess must be illegally dumped.

One of those games where control fluctuates, and you have to time things correctly to get the right awards while minimizing the dumping you do.

RATING: 6
Great filler; under 30 minutes. Rules have translation issues, but once you figure it out, it's easy to teach. Players play a number of same suit garbage cards into the corresponding factory, scoring points if the cap of 4 is hit and taking the factory garbage either way. If the garbage puts a player over the hand limit of 5, the overflow must be "illegally dumped", scoring negatively at the end of the game. Clever theme and mechanics combine to produce a really fun game that anyone can learn.

RATING: 4
A tricky little game of hand management. 
You play cards to comon stacks, earning points when completing a set of size 4+, but hand size is limited and each time you play cards, you have to pick some up too. Excess cards are discarded for negative points.
So there's a nice tension in playing for points, but not putting yourself at risk of negatives. And all in a fairly simple game.
Not particularly exciting, but OK as a mindless filler.

RATING: 5
hmmm - sort of a lesser cross between coloretto and poison, yet it has neither the focus nor simplicity
of two offer and it adds some small AP issues too. I'm not sure it has the depth to support the extra time it takes to play, nor does the added play time make likely get it to the table as easily as a quick filler like coloretto. That said there isn't anything wrong with the game, other then is doesn't compare well to already existing games in the light filler category. 

The cards are very nice quality but i'm not sure that they justify the price, you can buy a couple of amigo games for the same price... (poor cost to component ratio IMHO)

As I always say with card games, if it's not great it at least needs to quick and I think that's why I haven't really rated this game lower.  It's not a bad one, but there are just too many other great card games to waste time with mediocre games.  Traders of Carthage felt kind of similar but was executed better.  The theme was an interesting one, but I would rarely consider keeping a game for theme alone.  Sorry that I have nothing further to say.

Fast, fun recycling card game. Quick turns and good choices. A good combination in my book. 

I think I pass on playing this game more because of its lack of narrative. It's in some sort of gray area for me, where it's too repetitive, and while I like that in some games, I don't care for it here. Traders of Carthage has totally replaced this game for me, even though they're only remotely similar.

Enjoyable fast card game, simple choices but fun. Nice theme, and clever scoring mechanism. Good graphics, well worth picking up. *** Played my copy at home, and it is very quick, simple decision making, but really fun. Definitely want to play this again. The only fault is that it took 10 minutes to get all the cards back in the carton, a very very tight fit. You might want to make your own tuck box.

RATING: 5
A card game about the limited options and diminishing returns of waste management. The mechanics and theme jibe, but I think they make for an occasionally exasperating experience. Feels like, if your opponent is playing right, you're just juggling bad options. I like the light hand management though, and something about it is more engaging than Zooloretto Dice (which I really hate for its 'juggle bad options' feel).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
R-Eco feels a bit like 6 Nimmt! turned into an open information game, and quite likely a heaven for card counting sharks. There is a constant dilemma between being flexible and keeping waste production under control. For such a small box of cards the game packs quite a punch and still manages to stay well within filler territory which is really quite impressive.

Rating after 9 games: We loved our first few 2-player games but once we got in the groove, we ended up hating it. The idea behind the cards & rules seems great but just ends up not being good for us for 2 players. I would suggest you try several times before you buy if possible - it just doesn't seem to really work and is very frustrating; we tried with some variants, too. We found this frustrating because your decisions do not actually matter in the end - and luck really has nothing to do with it - randomness at its worst.   I love luck-based games but it is not good when you think your game play makes a difference & it just doesn't. I wonder how many of the high ratings for this game were based on more than 4 or so plays. But I don't wonder enough to research it.

This is a great, deceptively simple card game with unique rules.  The recycling theme is well done.  The game is the most fun for a large group, but probably not a good game for 2.  I could definitely play it several times before it would get old.

An interesting little card game that requires thoughtful hand management. However, there's not that much more to it than that. Played twice with three players, the interaction was fairly minimal, and certainly not directed. It was light fun, though, and I'd be interested in trying it again with more players.

Played again with 5 players, and it was quite different. Much more chaotic, but not necessarily in a bad way. The board can change so quickly before your turn comes around that you can be forced to take bad cards more often than in the 3-player game. Still fun.

First played August 29th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (<5 min) and quick play.  That makes it a great filler game.  There is a good luck/strategy mix for what it is as well.  You have to manage your cards by maximizing your points, and keep from illegal dumping (too many cards in your hand).  It's an enjoyable filler game.  I'd recommend giving it a try if you know someone who has it and give consideration in purchasing it if you are looking to expand your filler games.

This was an enjoyable and light card game.  The theme was pretty weak, but most of them are with card games like this.  A big focus was on hand management and trying to conform to the strict hand limit.

The scoring mechanics were refreshing and did give you some meaningful decisions to make.  And yet the whole decision tree was limited so analysis paralysis could set it.

In the end, I think there was nothing wrong with this game.  There also just wasn't enough of a hook for me to want to play it again.

May08: Well, didn't realize how much my wife liked it.  She saw it on the shelf and now we own it.  And it actually makes for a pretty good 2-player game.  After having a bit more time to understand it, I really like the contrast of trying to collect sets without dumping cards.  In my first 2-player game I ended with negative one point.  Ouch.  I imagine this will see more play now that we own it :)

RATING: 5
2017-10-31

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2013)

I have only played R-Eco on Yucata.de. At first, on 2013 I though the game was lever and fun to play, but as time has passed I have changed and I have been drifting away from lit games. And R-Eco is a light game.

The rules are pretty easy to learn. Playtime is rather short.

The theme is cool but you don’t feel it through the game.

Best with 2-3 players, with more the luck factor is way too high and uncontrollable.

The idea of the game is to take the correct amount of trash to get VPs. If you take too much and it will counts as negative VPs. The game uses hand management and drafting mechanisms in a clever way. The decisions aren’t very hard, but they aren’t that easy either.

Bottom line, R-Eco works as a filler, but I crave heavier experiences, so I won’t buy the game. Planning seems to be very almost impossible, furthermore with high player counts. Is it mostly a tactics endeavor. I could play again if requested, but my desire to do so is rather low.

Before Thurn and Taxis, came R-eco. The first card game (other than the standard deck we all play ;D) that i play.

It contains little to no down time at all. This is the type of card game that's play a card and take cards.

Interesting scoring mechanic.

RATING: 7
Very nice card game. The mechanics are interesting and the level of strategy feels just right for a good filler.  

UPDATE: Boy these are almost the hardest cards to shuffle I've ever encountered. And as it is a set-building game, good shuffling is a must! I'm keeping this at a 7, because I still think it is a good filler with light decisions, but it's not worth the irritation of the shuffle!! Selling.

RATING: 7
Game rating based on about 25 plays.  This is a quick, solid filler game.  You have to make the call in every game whether or not to remain "clean" in order to collect VP chits or accept a dumping penalty.  Excellent decision by Z-Man games to pick up this Japanese design, which is reminiscent in strategy to another great Japanese import, Mermaid Rain.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game. I like the dynamics between positive and negative point tokens, and the factory versus garbage piles.  

You have to keep an eye on the garbage pile as this will help you determine what you will do on your next turn. You are always skirting the edge of having too many cards in your hand.

The illegal dumping mechanic with negative points adds some tension.

Not scoring on single tokens at the end of the game is a nice twist as it forces you to concentrate on one or two colors.

Restocking the garbage pile after every turn feels a bit fiddly (although necessary).

A quick card game filler with a fun enough mechanism for a short game but ultimately not for me. The game ends when a player takes the last card from one of the four stacks. This card can be worth five points if that player already got another card of this colour. The winning player in our five-player game had seven points. Kind of disappointing to see how important this last action is and not enough influence in preparing for it. Probably better with fewer players and might rate '6' then.

A decent game, it plays quickly and there is definitely strategy involved.  If someone suggests it I'll play it, and I don't think I'd buy it.  I like the theme, though.  Give a hoot, don't pollute!

Looks really good and functions well. First you're trying to gather point cards, but then suddenly the game changes focus and turns into 6 Nimmt! and then again back to points hoarding. The cons are that the middle part is a bit luck oriented and the player who ends the game also gets a huge advantage.

Nice light filler with a good bit of depth for the type.  A bit of randomness by nature but, in order to do well, close attention must be paid to your opponent's play.  Quick and easy to learn.  The rule book in the Z-Man edition is atrocious however.

RATING: 8.5
This is a very pleasant, filler-level game to play.  It's a mechanically rock-solid game, but not very complex.  The way the game paces itself with the scoring chips is quite interesting, and always throws players for a loop - in a good way.

However, the more I think about it, the more I think the game's theme is a detriment to the experience.  If it doesn't just outright put people off from playing (which is stupid), the theme doesn't really help people understand the most critical aspect of the game (the scoring chips, and why you need two of a color to score them at all).  

It's not a deal breaker for me, but I can imagine this game living a much better life (and the life it deserves) in the boardgame universe if it had a better theme.

1. 暫時的感覺係，是一個互相坑人的遊戲

Played twice, 3p.  Pretty good climbing - trick taking - drafting game.  This is a game of mitigating your luck, and making your move at the right time, trying not to get too greedy which might ultimately net you many negative points.  It plays fairly quickly.  Only real drawback is, the rules aren't intuitive, so it is tricky to explain the game.

RATING: 7
This game is GARBAGE! :D    It's a card accumulation game where the goal is to be efficient at disposing cards (garbage).  You play the garbage cards into the appropriate Recycling facilities (piles) and acquire more garbage depending on where you placed.  Your hand limit is five and any excess is disposed of by means of "Illegal Dumping" (-1 for each dumping card).  An example of a good score, is relative to others of course, and might be -2, or might be as high as 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Plays best with 2-3, okay with 4, not sure about 5.  Pretty simple to play, it can be sometimes be frustrating to play, particularly if your opponent is adept at remembering what you have in your hand and forces you to take poor cards and points!  The more garbage (cards of a same type) you bring to a dump, the more cards you will force the next person to play on the dump to take.  Have 6 or more in your hand and you will have to discard down to 5 and lose a point for each card above 5!

A very nice filler. And I heard that it's cheap too! Definitely value for money. The only thing I dislike about it is it can be a little luck based. But then again in my first game, I won even after collecting 10 negative garbage points. Either way, I think it's a great, cheap little filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I at least to think that I'm quite the environmentalist, so the recycling theme really appeals to me. A neat little hand management, set collection, and card drafting filler that doesn't seem to be super deep but knowing what cards your opponents took and balancing getting the right cards without overloading your hand makes this a good filler.

The version I have (Z-Man addition) doesn't have a particularly well written rule book, and there might have been some translation error (e.g. the plastic bottles are labelled glass, the soda cans are steel). No idea if the Japon Brand edition also shares these problem, though I am envious of the much smaller box size of that version

Despite really liking the theme, I had a hard time trying to figure out how the mechanics matched it. My interpretation is putting cards in the factory is akin to returning recycled waste for the factory to use anew, and each factory particularly needs a certain type of resource. However, having more resources to manufacture causes the factory to produce more waste (hence why you draw more waste cards). I haven't figured out why having a critical amount of waste causes the factory to generate less waste  (maybe they don't have to buy raw materials anymore for a short period of time?) or why you can get negative VPs for supplying waste though.

What a unique little card game. I find the mechanics really interesting and enjoyable considering it's just a filler. The theme fits in well and is a breath of fresh air.

I'm gonna hang onto this one since it's out of print.

Currently my favorite filler to teach -- I love the "ah-ha!" moment when people "get it", and then the game ends and they need to immediately play again... 

The Japanese version comes in a box about half the size of the Z-Man version, and as far as I can tell only differs in having cards instead of round cardboard tokens for the rewards. The cards are easier to play with, but take up slightly more room on the table as you're playing.

As a solo game, it's a decent time waster, although it gets very samey once you figure out the right approach.

At 5 players, it was a chaotic mess, and is 100% tactical, as in "what can I play this turn so I don't get completely screwed?" Long term strategy is impossible at 5p, so at least the turns are mercifully short.

I imagine it would be decent at 2p and okay at 3p. I wouldn't recommend more than 3p.

Quick card game in which different sorts of waste have got to be sorted and gathered in the correspondent factories for being treated. Constant trading of waste cards is involved - hands should grow to gather enough cards to fill up a factory but without surpassing a limit size (each excess card brings a penalty); thus, the main skill in the game lies in balancing the trades for more and less cards, as well as in waiting for the factories to offer the biggest scores.

Pleasant enough little push-and-shove card game; good for a filler. Major do-gooding theme turn-off doesn't really help, and it's difficult to overcome the randomness that comes round to you every turn. Possibly most effective with two in that respect.

I think this is one of the better fillers out there. Maintaining a tight rein on your hand, along with accepting you WILL give points away to your opponents mean this one contains some tough choices. A very simple "play cards, then pick up cards" mechanic belies some tough decisions. Recommended.

Nice opener or closer. It can be played light and fast, or carefully, watching what everyone picks up. There's a fair bit of luck with the hand size and the luck of what comes out in the pick-up piles, and who plays what before you, and whether what you want to pick up will still be there. All of which makes the game difficult to engineer your way. It's more a collect wisely and live in hope game. If you can live with the luck, and it's only a 15-20 minute game after all, the gameplay is otherwise quite interesting and different.

I need to try this F2F again before deciding it's fate. 2 games in at Yucate, and I'm liking it. I like games where you're forced to decide between helping yourself or screwing others.

Side note-I really like the same designer's "Traders of Carthage", so this had been on my wish list. 

I suck at this game. I just suck. about 15+ games in at Yucate and can't win to save my life

Quite a twisted card game. Mostly you want to avoid everything but not always. A great luck factor is the other players and their intentions.
Light but weird.

It tells something about the game that I got 17 points while three others got 0. Let me repeat: a weird game, got it?

Won't probably play this again a while. Not a complete disaster though.

R-Eco is a filler along the lines of Coloretto or 6 Nimmt. Cards represent different types of trash, which you must take to the appropriate recycling plant, in return picking up whatever has been dumped there. It's fun enough but could do with more direct screwage. Traded 10/09.

Somebody named this one as one of the best game designs from Japan, so count me interested. In a math trade I had the opportunity to pick up this one.
In R-Eco, or Recycle, your find four kinds of cards, four types of garbadge. At your turn you place one or more cards of one type above the one of four matching recycling factories. If there are four or more items above that factory, you score. The cards then are discarded.
If you scored or not, at the end of your turn, you have to take the cards, waste, below the factory.
If you then exceed your handlimit, you have to discard cards, each card at the end is one penalty point.
This is a clever, nicely flowing game. It is fast and it is simple in the rules. Great pickup!

RATING: 7.1
A nice, tight game system that functions like a machine. While fiddly to manipulate, the flow of the game is easy to pick up on and understand. Scoring is clever and the introduction of negative values adds to the already agonizing choices throughout the game. Timing is key, attempting to plan ahead a turn or two while managing the current turn is tricky, and if you aren't careful you'll lock yourself into bad or worse options. Of course it is a card game, so there is a level of randomness that's hard to account for even with careful planning. Good filler game.

An interesting card game where you play cards in a factory and replenish your hand from the same factory's dump site. A very clever game and fast playing game which seems to have one drawback: you don't score enough points! In the two games we played the scores were nearer 0 than 10 with the highest score being 9. Most people in those games complained about it being too difficult to score points. I don't mind it but if you are used to 72 or 84 points in some games these scores might feel a bit low...

Starts getting a little darned-if-you-do-and-darned-if-you-don't as the rubbish tips start filling up and although you don't want to... you've gotta take _something_ from amongst all the crap which I always find enjoyable.  It's about hand management and picking your redraw cards to target identified tasty scoring opportunities.  Very neat and to me it actually feels quite Knizia-esque.

So far, I am have some favorable thoughts toward this game.  I like the play a card and draw what it left mechanic.  This gives you some interesting options for tactical play, particularly in regards to trying to force other players to take more cards than they really want.  The negative points for excess cards makes this a viable option.  Unfortunately, it seems that at times you can really be hampered by your hand and be stuck in a situation where you really have no viable options -- take negative points, pick up a chunk of excess cards, set up another player, or essentially do nothing.  Getting stuck in that situation makes the game really uninteresting.  I can see where strategically taking negative points is important.  However, there are still times when you get stuck with them without gaining any real advantage.  All in all, I can see where this game might grow on me if I played it a little more -- I just don't see those extra plays coming on. [03/14/2008]

Has the makings of a good filler - simple, yet with moments of tough decisions where you weigh the benefits and harms of exceeding your hand size and being forced to dump cards illegally. The theme is thin, and the gameplay is quite chaotic in comparison to other notable card fillers.

This probably fits in with a lot of other good card fillers like Piece o' Cake, Turn the Tide etc.

[4 plays] Excellent little card game here. Quick to teach, fun to play, clever (but thin) theme, and good quality components. (Exception is that the cards are too thick to shuffle easily - hopefully they will break in a little)

I think there is more depth and less luck here than it would seem after the first couple of plays. Time will tell, but in the meantime I am eager to play this a bunch more.

Most recent plays 7-3-10 with Barb and Garrett.

RATING: 7.5
A tense filler in the vein of 6 Nimmt etc. Players are disposing four types of garbage into recycling factories. They then get back cards from the factory. If this causes their hand to exceed the 5 card limit, they have to 'illegally' dispose cards down to 5. Each card is -1 VP at the end of the game. Along the way, players pick up VP cards from factories if they contribute enough garbage.

A very strange theme but the whole recyling of cards works well. It's a trick taking game of sorts with players constantly trying to manage their hands. Nice one!

No complaints.  It's really just an easy filler game that you could play with kids or non-gamers.  It reminds me a bit of a Knizia game like Escalation! or Trendy, although Knizia seems to prefer to design games with five suits so that they can't be played with a traditional set of cards.

Play a card, to get cards, a ver simple Idea that mostly works, but the hand size limit that insures negative point really kills this for me.  You are constantly stuck with a hand of four and if you want to do build up your cards into a decent hand you limit the options that you can chose on your turn.  Often you will have to pick up cards to dump just to keep a worthwhile hand.  Often you this game just has you building up areas for others to score.  In a three player game if you leave something open for another player to score, then they will take their turn and it leaves space for the next player to not leave anything for you, which means you get to do it all over again.

I would hope this wouldn't be so God Awful with more players, but I feel that it would be more out of control.  I really hate the negative cards as well, as when you are building your hand you may have to kill your work to avoid it taking negative points either way.  

This game is severly unpleasant.

RATING: 6.5
Nice filler, easy to teach and quick to play. I'm not sure that you really have a lot of control, though -- seems a bit random. Still, there are some decisions to make and it does play very quickly.

There are 4 types of garbage, each with a pile of scoring cards (varies with player number, but generally something like 0, 1, 2, 3, -2, 4, 5). Cards are of each type, with 1 or 2 symbols. Deal each player 3, and place 1 card above each score pile. On your turn, play a set of cards of one type below that pile and take ALL the cards on the other side of the score pile. If your play brings the #symbols up to 4 or more, you get the top score card (game ends when the last score card of any pile is taken). Replace the cards you took with cards from the deck: one more card than the total number of symbols below the pile. Your hand limit is 5 -- discard any extras into your 'dump'. 

At end of game, score cards only score if you have 2  cards in that color. Lose 1 point per card in your dump. Finally, if you never dumped, get 1VP/player that did. The player with the most VP wins.

[Z-man 07 edition] {Environment, filler; hand-management, set-collection; optimal 3-4p} R-Eco is a solid filler. It's quite fun and engaging but the theme is just pasted on. It requires strong hand management skill. Players have weak control in 5p game but it's not totally chaotic.  Apart from hand management, players have to pay attention to what junks other players are collecting to help themselves.  Being ignorant of what other are doing, it is impossible to win.  It's also about timing of play and risk-taking. It supports both aggressive and defensive playing style but I think aggressive play is more rewarding in this game.

[Updated] I have tried both English and Japanese edition. The game rules, theme and illustration are the same. The components are similar: Japanese use paper money while Z-man uses tokens. The box of Z-man is much larger, though.

A quick little game about recycling.  You have a truck of a certain size and you go around picking up recycling and dropping it off at the right recycling plant.  If you bring enough or just enough at the right time, you get paid.  If your truck gets too full you have to illegally dump some of your recycling which nets you negative points.  Bonus points t the end to the people who managed to not illegally dump and that's about it.  Fun little filler.  I like it a lot. 2009/03/11

It didn't wow me, but it is a solid little game. Not the kind of thing you'd ever rush out to buy but one you're always happy to play when it is suggested.

Perhaps a re-theme would make this more appealing/exciting?

This is a pretty fun little filler.  I used to own it,  But I have a lot of 'pretty fun little fillers'  I'm not quite sure why I would play this one over a couple of the other ones I have.  I'm a Minimalist.  Trying to play more of the games I like more often rather than playing all the individual little games a couple of times.  

R-Eco, in the long run didn't make the cut.

I've only played this once, but I was sufficiently impressed that I put it on my wishlist straight away.  I like the unusual.  It is not good just because it is unusual, but it is good and it is unusual and that is a winning combination.

RATING: 5
This game has some interesting things going on, but for me it felt pretty arbitrary, especially towards the end.  The scoring can swing pretty wildly on the last turn, and the difference between scoring big and damaging the environment and losing a bunch of points right at the end is huge.

Pros: Fun theme with interesting mechanic.
Nice components.
Deep Strategy.

Cons: Some luck included.
Dot order issue (use house rule).
Hard to shuffle.

Conclusion: R-Eco is a fun and interesting card game that can be learned quickly but never mastered (at least by me).  I really like the dumping of cards and having to take new cards mechanic.  It can be played a number of times in one sitting and has a lot of player interaction.  A great game!

Good game, easy to play in the background while still having conversation. Doesn't really capture anything deep about recycling and ecology. It shows a few very basic ideas, such as illegal dumping will cost you in the end.
Good for variety of players 2-5. Good for filler.

RATING: 7
Played numerous times with all different number of players. This is a very quick, fun card game about recycling. Definitely some luck in the draw and most of the choices are pretty straightforward, but it scales well and supports newbies quite well. For 2-player, I definitely recommend using the variant of stacking the tokens differently (0,2,4,-2,3,1) and playing until two factories are completed.

Still trying to figure out this game. Number of players definitely changes the strategy, however it scales well. Setting up future plays while avoiding negative points is pretty hard. I like the theme, playtime, and simple ruleset.

Thankfully Z-Man goes through the trouble of picking out which Japanese card games to bring over to the U.S. so we don't have to sift through the countless offerings to find the hidden gems. R-Eco is just one such instance that Z-Man brought over a while back, but which I finally had the chance to try this year, and while it didn't measure up to Fairy Tale in my mind, it was a worthy game in its own right. Designed by Susumu Kawasaki, whose 2006 design Traders of Carthage is another Japanese game that I'd like to try out sometime, this is a card game classically in the mold of other Japon Brand or Grimpeur titles. If those are generally your cup of tea, or even if you're looking for something along the same lines as Coloretto, No Thanks, or Bull in a China Shop, then this one is worth checking out.

Filler. Cuatro mazos de cartas. Puedes colocar una o varias del mismo palo en el mazo correpondiente. Cuando colocar la cuarta te llevas el mazo completo. Algunas cartas cuentan doble. A veces interesa llevarse el mazo a veces no porque da puntos negativos. Entretenido

Rated in terms of fillers.

This is a fascinating little filler game. So far, games take about 20 minutes to play. The scores are always somewhat odd - the scoring system is strange, but works well enough. There is certainly some luck here, but plenty of strategy to make it challenging in terms of decision-making. The theme is irrelevant to gameplay, but it's cute enough. I've been really pleased with this new innovative addition to my collection. New players can easily win, while experienced players will still feel they are making interesting decisions.

This game has been getting a lot of play in my group. Everyone caught on quickly and the games move fast now.

RATING: 4
Tried a two player and five player version a handful of times. Game is too long and is a glorified filler. Most times, the decisions are straightforward and the biggest decision to make is when to sacrifice cards for illegal dumping. The game is just a little too long and too involved with not too many decisions to make during gameplay.

Heard really good things about this at BGG.con, but never got to play it.  Update: I played it, and after hearing the rules, I really had no idea how the game even worked, but it worked fine in practice and was fun.  I have played it more, and there is a tension to this game that I enjoy.  Nice...  :)

Fun little filler game that has a nice little mechanic. The fact that you gain 'junk' everytime you recycle puts a bit of decision making into every action. Do you recycle on blue to get 3 points to only pick up four cards and have to illegal dump for -2 points? My seven-year-old daughter caught on very quick and yet I didn't feel like it was over simple. Fun, quick, and thoughtful. Great for a filler game for sure.

A nice little card game, well themed.  My large number of plays are mostly two-player, with the variant found on BGG: it was a favorite of my late wife's.  A little slow with five players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game!  Most of my plays have been two-player games.  With two players, it is not too overwhelming to count the other player's cards.  Doing so is VERY beneficial.  By my way of thinking, this is a two edged sword.  It allows for much more skillful play, but it rewards those players who are better at or more willing to invest the mental effort to keep track of what cards their opponents have collected. Since this information is public, it can turn this into a glorified version of "memory".  Because of this it might be be better to play with hands revealed in two-player games.

First Play - 4 players. A fun little card game. Hand management is the way to win but having the players in front of you set you up for a big play is probably the way most games will be decided. Game ended 10-8-6-(-2). The person who won had the most illegal dumping and the person who didn't illegal dump came in third even with the bonus. I finished right between the two.

garbage is so casual, it's something we produce everyday. and the theme of recycling is just okay for a game

the gameplay is simple, collecting and delivering garbage. the rule of capping the number of cards in hand is nice, and 2 point worth cards work well with the rule. the scoring system is a bit unusual, but it's still fine. well there's not a really good strategy, it's hard to aim for win (except if you remember what cards people are holding) but it's okay since the game is short, you can just play again. the playing time around 15 minutes is just fine

the quality of components are okay, the fact that there's no text is very good for a filler game, made it much easier to teach and understand. card artwork is okay, the colors are bright enough so it's easy to play anywhere. the cover artwork is a bit ugly though. box size is good, it can hold sleeved cards, and the material is thick enough

well actually recycling garbage is not that easy, but this game would make a good education : please separate garbages, recycling is easy so do it, etc etc. this game is simple, very good for filler game. i rate it 8+

Every year, I seem to find a new filler game that becomes my go-to game for the year whenever we have a small group looking to kill some time before the other gamers appear.  In 2008, it appears to be R-Eco.  It's quick and breezy, though not without some tactical decisions that will help players win the game.  The last two games that filled this niche for me were Geschenkt and Fairy Tale, two other Z-Man games, so I'll be watching for the Next Big Filler from them in 2009.  The game plays as well with 2 as it does for 3 and 4, but there seems to be a bit too much going on with 5 to make it quite as interesting of an experience.  Still, for the price, I expect to see this one hit the table quite often.

While not closely matching Coloretto in dynamic, it certainly resonates in similar ways in that you're attempting to avoid gaining cards that score negatively. I like these little abstract card games, they're easy to teach and play quickly, great for low-impact gaming both on time and effort scales.

Since the card stacks change dramatically from turn to turn, more players = more chaos = less player control.  As a result, R-Eco is most strategic and interesting as a two-player game, although fun enough with more than two.

Other games with the same issues: Monad, Hansa, Wildlife Adventure/Expedition.

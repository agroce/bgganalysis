A bit of a different dice game.  Some [b]Yahtzee[/b], but the ending conditions make the game.  The cards are plenty and they have a bunch of text (a downer for me), but it gave me a good vibe while playing it.

I may not ever buy it, but it was pleasant.

A dungeon crawl that presents players with a few options: fight the dragon or flee, focus on grabbing treasure and/or money.  I'm not a fan of rolling (and re-rolling) buckets of dice, but found that more palatable in Dragon Rampage because of the neat system for allocating them to various activities, competing with other players for limited slots to do each one.

The game is let down by two, perhaps three things.  First, it outstays its welcome; ninety minutes plus for such a light game is just wrong.  Second, a lot of the card text is opaque.  I found it hard to believe that people with English as a first language had produced this game.  Third, I'm not sure about game balance; the run away option seems easier than fighting the dragon.

Production quality is decent but the artwork is pretty uninspired.

Imagine a 2+ hour game of Yahtzee with a fantasy skin on it.  That's pretty close to what you have here.  There are no decisions which make a meaningful difference in the game.  If it lasted less than an hour it might be OK, but this really drags...

I played Dragon Rampage for the first time yesterday and really had a good time.  I think the card decks for each of the characters really help define them and give flavor to how you play the game.  You get a real sense of how that type of character may act in the Fight of Flight situation.

The game is easy to learn and engaging.  I really like the way the game can form alliances and those alliances can change.  I did not feel much down time between my turns, because even when I was not rolling the dice I was cheering on my allies and wishing bad luck roles for the others.

I liked the size and weight of the dice and the fact they are etched.  The base symbols on the dice are easy enough to read, however the outside patterns on the dice is not needed and adds clutter.  I would have chosen different color dice to delineate them. 

I really enjoyed the push your luck aspect of rerolling the dice.  If you choose to reroll to improve your roll, you run the chance of further angering the dragon.  

I think additional characters as an expansion would be nice.

I thought it was a lot of fun to play and is one on my "I will always play that one" list.

Apart from some typos and some lack-luster art work, I really enjoy this competitive dice rolling game.  For a game about rolling dice and trying to get more of a given roll than the other players, I'm impressed by how much strategy plays a part in this game.

Not good. Going last in a five player game is a bad place to be. There is too much downtime between turns and once you are done there is practically nothing for you to do unless you happen to have a card which can interrupt another player's turn. In 90 minutes I took six turns, which essentially meant rolling seven dice a few times then waiting 15 minutes before being able to play again.

'Long' filler - or rather could be if people can't make decisions when it is their turn to roll the dice ...

Dice roller with a theme and individualised decks - overall like it.

Shame the dice are all 'white' but the rules call them by colours. Would have been easier to play if the 3 types (well 4 if you also include the moveent die) were different.

Overall, like it - I think fleeing looks to be the best option, but that sort of fits the theme ... and I haven't played the slayer characters yet, so my feelings might change.

Box is typical eagle brick, so postage would be horrendous, so try before you buy as trading is going to be expensive.

Highly random dice game.  I don't mind randomness if there are enough "laugh out loud" moments to make it enjoyable but Rampage feels too mechanical to me.  It is fine for what it is, but don't go into it thinking it is a strategy game.  It is better with more players because there is more competition for the awards, but more players lengthens the game and downtime between turns, which makes it less fun.  I think 4 players is probably the sweet spot.

The player cards referring to colored dice that do not exist is a ridiculous error that should have been corrected by Eagle before putting out the game.  Obviously it would cost money to reprint the cards, but that is what they should have done - not try to make the game playable by putting in their "band-aid" text in the rulebook that makes no sense.  Referring to numbered spaces on the movement path that don't exist (and an unlabeled start space) is also ridiculous but more easily dealt with.  Very poor development work by Eagle on this game.

RATING: 6
At it's core Dragon Rampage is pretty much a glorified dice game, where the dice are pretty much the game, but it manages to feel a little more meaty than the typical roll/re-roll/re-roll dice game.

Players are trying to roll sets of symbols on the dice in order to receive benefits of various actions.  All players get to roll the dice and record their results, and then players take actions according to what symbols they rolled vs. what symbols other players rolled.  For example, if you rolled the most weapons, you get to try to beat on the dragon, or if you rolled the most treasures, you get to draw a treasure card.

Also adding a little flavor to the game are action cards that each player has, which can be played to alter the effects and results of all sorts of things.  Each player is a different race and has a different deck of cards corresponding to that race.

Points are scored in a myriad of ways, and the points even change based on how the game ends!  For example, if the game ends by someone fleeing the dragon lair, points are scored differently than if the game ends with the dragon being slain.  So, there are competing interests among players.  Some may want the game to end one way, and others want it to end another way, with the winner depending on which pushed the game to their preferred ending first.

I enjoyed the game, but I'm docking my score a point for this game having the absolute worst editing I've ever seen in a game; or should I say, lack of editing.  Important game terms are referred to inconsistently, often being referred to by several different names; the rules call it one thing, the cards call it another thing, and the player aid calls it yet another thing.  Several cards also refer to various colors of dice, even though all the dice in the game are white.  You have to refer to a FAQ section of the rules to find out "Oh, by the way, when this card refers to 'yellow dice' it means the dice with this pattern on them".  Just glaringly obvious mistakes in the editing process for this game all around.  When you write rules, card text, and player aids, pick a term for a component and stick with it!

Overall, a cool game though.  Just a shame about the lack of care that was taken in its publication.  I think this game could have been really popular if the graphic design, rules clarity, and editing process had been taken seriously.

I love the yahtzee-style dice rolling and the big bright dice. Each character feels quite different from the others thanks to unique ability cards. I love the way the random dice rolls contribute to a sort of blind bid/worker placement mechanic during the action roll phase. There's a good deal of strategy in choosing which rolls you want to keep and which ones you want to re-roll. You can shoot for really high in attack to know off the current highest player, or just settle for a 1 in treasure if no one else is on the spot. You can win the game with vastly different strategies (full on attack, running away, stuffing your bags with treasure while everyone else does the hard work). The game is short but could be paced a little faster, and the difficulty could be higher (as one character I feel considerably more powerful than the dragon, and you'll be playing with at least three players). Luckily, it's very easy to mod the rules to make the dragon more powerful and challenging.

In short: Good game let down by its components. 

Fun Yahtzee type dice game with three possible endings/scoring conditions. 3 plays - 2 ended with someone escaping the dungeon and 1 ended with the slaying of the dragon.

Some of the components are a bit sub par. The board serves its purpose but looks a bit of a mess. Positioning the dragon wound space in the centre where the dice are going to be rolled is annoying. The player mats need to include the info for the three endings. The cards need bigger text. The dice are rather unattractive and some of the symbols/colours are hard to discern.

Super high quality production and the components weigh a ton.  The game play is sort of fun, but a bit too clunky to run smoothly.  Rule changes for 3 players are obviously tacked on = There should either be a double sided board or notations on the spaces for 3/4/5 player games.  Also changing the values on Dragon Rampage cards for 3/4 players is easy to forget.  Trade pile!

Good game.
Tried it so far with 4 and 5 players. Both are good, but 5 is best. It really crams up the board so that the player that goes last only gets crappy scraps. That makes it supersweet to go first or second. 

I have been looking for a dice roller to have in my collection, and I think this one might be it.

Each player has a different hero, with very different hero cards (skills). So each game different in the way you play.

I think that this game shouldn't be played with less than 4 players, but I haven't tried.

Oh my god, this game sucks. I have nothing against Yahtzee style games, but at the very least, make it functional! The dice faces are a mess and hard to tell apart (orange vs yellow), have garish borders to add to the confusion (each has a different shaped frame to unintuitively let you know the different faces on it), and are intended to match squares on the main board that often get covered up, so you have way to reference where they belong.

The dungeon crawl part is very tacked on. Each character class is very scripted and is there to force you into a particular win condition. In the end you just keep a seat warm, since there are few meaningful decisions and the ones you make are plagued by random forces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A sloppy, bloated game on a yahtzee frame that, despite all odds, is actually fresh and enjoyable. Maybe a tad too long, but it's worth at least a play or two. Slightly longer and more complex than King of Tokyo.

I wanted to like this heroic boss battle more. Halfway the game, it gets repetitive and it's better to save the treasure for the victory points they are worth than using them. So you're rather hoping to draw a 4 than to draw that 'useful' jewel.

I also have the feeling that once you decide to focus on escaping the dragon's lair, it's rather easy to succeed. Perhaps players should be able to disturb one's plans a bit more ? Or at least the possibility of getting killed should be a bit higher (less healing options, more fierce dragon attacks).

All in all, a bit of a disappointment.

EDIT :
After some adaptations, we had a blast of a gaming session, and therefor I'm giving it a 7 now. So this is what I suggest :
* for victory condition 'escaping the lair' make the best 3 treasure cards count, otherwise only the best 2 (to focus less on your treasure score & making it more worthwhile to actually use them)
* add 1 extra damage the dragon does on his dragon rampage attacks AND/OR start with 2 wounds each
* and you might also consider to only start with 2 character cards instead of 3, given how easy you get new ones

Other than having to put a little effort into finding rules and/or referencing the rules/faq during the first game, We found this a very enjoyable game.  It certainly takes a game or two to get a real sense for how the flow can go, due to the multiple game end conditions.  But after the first game, I feel players have a better understanding of the different actions/phases and how to play without too many rules getting in the way.  Very enjoyable, but I do think it is best with 4-5 players, although still enjoyable as 3 (higher player counts will make the game more "back stabbing" and allow for much more player interaction).

Dragon Rampage is a very nice game, though I don't like the artwork too much. The rules are fairly simple and I like that there are different ways for the game to end and more characters than possible players. But because of the dice it is just too random. Last time we played, I didn't get to attack the dragon even once by ways of the attack-the-dragon action box, which made it really difficult for me to inflict any damage on the dragon at all. On top of that, in my copy there was no "hourglass die", which is needed for some of the heroes' cards. I wrote to Eagle Games about that, but I never got an answer. My boyfriend asked them about the die at their booth at Essen last year and after sending another e-mail I finally got it. :)

There are some holes in the rules/card texts.

I didn't love it, but it's hard to put my finger on the problem. There was no single glaring problem. As one of the other players put it, "It's a little long for what it is." That's a decent summary.

The fantasy theme wasn't particularly well integrated. I never felt like I was fighting a dragon or running from a dungeon. There was no tension. In particular, the dragon rampage phase was a little underwhelming. Depending on player order, take a wound or two. I felt like there needed to be something more there.

The action cards were also kind of boring. Take some gold, avoid a wound, etc. I'd prefer more complex and interactive powers.

Same thing with fighting the dragon. Roll the dice, add a token or two to the center of the board. Not exactly an epic battle with a mighty beast.

This game is a difficult one to rate. It is a fabulous premise for a game and is graphically well designed. However the whole game is out of wack. The goal of the game is to either score the most points by slaying a dragon, or escaping from the dragons den. The damage the Dragon inflicts via the Rampage cards is ridiculously weak. Everyone in my group was laughing at how ineffectual the dragon was in terms of inflicting damage, and how easy it was to dodge, or heal any damage actually taken. Healing is too powerful and the most dangerous Dragon square does only 2 damage and actually rewards the player at the same time with a hero card that will probably undo that damage.

The whole game needs to be tweaked and it just feels like it was never properly play tested. I want to love this game because it has fantastic potential but improperly weights risk-reward. You shouldn't have to introduce a whole bunch of adjustments to the point scoring system to try to fix a game (ie. to make the dragon relevant). "Dragon Wimpage" is a more accurate description of this game. In summary, a game with some great ideas implemented poorly by the designer.

At heart it's yahtzee with knobs on, but that doesn't stop it from being a lot of fun. Different end conditions with different scoring add a nice additional element.

However, there was too much downtime with 5 players. I enjoyed my turns, but they seemed to take a while coming round, especially as I was going for the 'run out of the dragon's lair' win and therefore wasn't involved in the dragon fights. It felt a bit like 2 minutes for my turn with the dice, then wait 15-20 minutes for another turn.

This game is a tremendous amount of fun.  It is dice-rolling craziness wrapped up in a fantasy theme.  We have played this game with people who do not like fantasy themed games - and they had a great time.  The multiple endings keep the game fresh, and the replayability of this game is high.  After our first play, I thought "yeah, I'd definitely play that again".  Our second play was just a day later, and it was such a rollicking good time I now can't wait for this game to hit the table.

While I appreciate a quick dice roller like this (yahtzee style) - even the long game was pretty quick - I found it very hard to explain the victory conditions to the players. It doesn't help that there is so much scoring to be done. It would have really helped if the scoring was somehow simplified.

That said, I do think the various endgames lead to a great tension in the game. Altogether, I'm quite pleased with the game.

I am absolutely loving this game!  And it gets a small bonus for the family's love, too.  The 4 of us have had some great, tense games...with the victors not emerging until the end, thanks to some clever card play, good timing, and smart choices.
Yes, there is some luck...but nothing that ruins/makes someone's game at all.

An absolute blast!  I eagerly hope for some expansions.  maybe a new adventurer or two...maybe some new treasures...maybe a new Dragon type, with his/her own deck of Rampage...

The game has great potential but just seems far too easy to destroy the dragon with 3 players.
It's like sitting down waiting for an a turn film to start and by the end,your still waiting for it to get going.

That said, with 4 players it is really awesome. i would highly recommend this to anyone who has a gaming group of more than 3 people

Fun game: imagine the dice mechanic of King of Tokyo but layer on top of it much more theme and strategy and you have a great game.  Each player has their own deck (e.g. Rogue, Barbarian, etc) with specific cards which adds great flavor.  The three different ways the game can end which in turn creates three different scoring criteria makes this a very fun and challenging game to win.

The game is an okay dice roller. Nothing very special but it works okay - has some nice ideas and some small confusing fiddliness (e.g. end game scoring depending on conditions). Character abilities could be more different and more interesting, but they are also... okay.

What I have problem with is the game components. I like the artwork - the paintings I mean - but nothing else.

To quote Myok's comment:
"I like the game portion of this game, but the components including the board, manual, cards and player mats all need to be reworked to be more legible, agree with each other on basic facts, and assist the flow of the game instead of hinder it."

- Player cards had lots of text that were hard to read - small and hard to read fonts.
- the painting on the board is nice but it just makes the board a bit too busy, not pleasing the eye.
- end game conditions and scoring should be shown on player mats or board.
- dice and card text don't match.
- two different oranges on the dice...?
- overall, I wasn't satisfied with the look.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Another game centered around the Yahtzee mechanic. In general, I don't find these type of games all that engaging with a fair bit of down time. This is fine, but nothing I need to own or play again. There can be nastiness and take that in this one with cards that will mete out damage or allow you to steal, etc.

Quality components, chunky dice with etched symbols and a lot of fun... but one mark against this is the obvious lack of editing and play testing as the cards have quite a few textual errors or inconsistencies that were corrected in the rule book instead of reprinting the cards. These flaws are easy enough to work around. Good game nevertheless. Sadly you need 3+ to play which is why I got rid of it. Still a great game under all of these strikes against it.

Test play without cards . I think this is better than it looks. Don't like the design. Seems cluttered and not very clean. Like the ideas though and the limiting mechanism. Could do with a clearer cheat sheet the boards are just not clear (design again) but then again with familiarity this issue will not be there. 

It feels in-polished- for example the terms on some cards are different in the manual, also the treasure space on the player board is not mentioned but the others are, like it was added afterwards. 

This game really took off when the banter began. It all about competitive dice rolling. If someone has a spot either you need to go higher or there might not even be space to do anything unless you get a super high roll pushing people off the bottom of the available spaces. Great. Now need to complete the game!

One of those "it's a co-op but there is still 1 winner" games with scoring that seemed a little strange. If you focus on just killing the dragon or running you seem to still be at the mercy of getting treasures and others.

Best w/4, 3-5:

It's fun if you don't take it too seriously, but why would you?  The rulebook is a bit obtuse in my opinion, but the game plays well enough.  I get the impression the game could have benefited from additional play testing.  Overall I like the game.  Gameplay utilizes the yahtzee mechanic, with a dungeon crawl theme of grabbing treasure and fighting a dragon, and an unpredictable ending.  4 and 5 player is the sweet spot due to scarcer resources (action spaces), and 3 player might need house rules to balance (for example, the dragon is weaker, but the exit is still the same distance so it is easier to kill the dragon then escape).  I think this game is more entertaining when the players play each other as much as the game (trash talk, take that, bluffing, partnerships).  If everyone plays Euro style (limited interaction) then this game can be quite dull.

fun game, just came out at a poor time in the game dev release cycle. doesn't help that a number of the cards are misprinted with inaccurate info so it makes it tougher to sort out what you should do.

Okay, you and your fellow adventurers have sneaked into the dragon's lair and have more or less gotten what you wanted (though there is still plenty of treasure lying about), some damn fool - probably the barbarian - has gone and woken up the dragon.  Now the true colors are showing for all the troupe.  Suddenly, it is every person for themselves!  Are you going to try to kill the dragon or are you going to make a run for the exit?  Oh, and suddenly a few of you are feeling cooperative because the stupid rogue is making a run for daylight while the three of you are fighting the dragon.  Time to work together to sabotage their run!  Fun game!

Played this several times at Dice Tower Con and really enjoyed it. The tension of several ways to end the game and the factions that form among the players is really interesting. 

I was also struck by the difference between the 4 and 5 player games. I didn't think one was better than the other, just different. The 5 is a much tighter game. 

This is one that I think will be in my collection for a long time to come.

I like the game portion of this game, but the components including the board, manual, cards and player mats all need to be reworked to be more legible, agree with each other on basic facts, and assist the flow of the game instead of hinder it.  

Specifically:

(1) Font on the player mats and cards is too small.  The mats have a lot of unused space.  At minimum, the card adjustments for certain # of players should be included, and end game conditions need to be laid out.  Alternatively this could all be summarized on the back page of the manual.
(2) On the board, the action tiles cover the action spots completely, making it hard to tell when a row is filled up. Smaller action tiles, larger squares or a label for each row would help with that.
(3) On the board, the start position is not labeled.  Arrows would show the flow toward the exit and eliminate this problem.  Also the rules refer to things like even and odd spaces omitting the start space; numbering is needed to make that easier to calculate.
(4) On the board, the spot for accumulated dragon damage is right in the center of the board, in the big open spot where dice are commonly rolled.  Make it a separate area off to the side or off the board.
(5) The dice and card text don't match.  This is covered in a paragraph in the rule book but still seems silly.  I'm tempted to buy blank dice in the appropriate colors and attach labels with easier-to-read iconography.
(6) The dice use two shades of orange for stealing and treasure.  Surely a different color could be used for one of those.
(7) The manual needs a picture of the board with spots labeled clearly.

I would have given this game a 9, but the ambiguity of the text and inconsistent use of game terms on the cards cost it half a point.  Hopefully, the cards will be reviewed and edited for the second printing.

In the meantime, don't let that dissuade you from picking up this fine game.  The user who rated it a 1 must have an axe to grind with Richard and/or Eagle Games, because his comments regarding downtime are wrong.  My 4-player group was engaged during every facet of the game, trying to convince the active player to take actions against others instead of themselves.  It very much reminded me of the great banter we have while playing Cosmic Encounter.

BTW, the 8 dice are things of beauty!

Fun game, but doesn't scale well. Wouldn't recommend playing it with 5+ players. Also, especially at this player count, down-time has to be taken into consideration (which matters, because there's not nearly as much direct interaction as in King of Tokyo for example).

UPDATE: Benefits HIGHLY from reading the FAQ, since many ESSENTIAL things are not properly - or at all - adressed in the rulebook.

My Yahtzee-style dice game of choice.

I was surprised at how fun this game is. It's a little long and procedural for what it is, but I like that for a Yahtzee-style dice game, almost every face can be useful in different situations. The overall scenario is that of dealing with a raging dragon, but there's also some messing with other players and trying to be the one to do the most damage to the dragon or escape. This would probably be an 8 if the game moved along at a faster clip and had a better presentation, as the rough edges are pretty noticeable here. 

Supposedly the Dice Tower is doing a new version of this with Arcane Wonders, and if they clean up the rule set a bit, this could become one of my favorite dice games.

Pretty average dice roller with interesting theme that doesn't quite work.  Your main actions for the turn are too dependent on the whims of the dice and it's difficult to develop much in the way of longer-term strategies.  I really wanted to like this more than I did as the run-fight-steal mechanic is conceptually very appealing.

RATING: 5
What I liked:
- Multiple ways for the game to end
- Variety of hero card decks
- It's a very well-designed game
- The theme works pretty well

What I didn't like:
- It's all about majorities, a mechanic I don't like
- The dice graphic design could have been better
- First learning game took 130 minutes, which is too long (later games have gone faster)

I can definitely see the appeal of this game. If I enjoyed screwage more, and liked majority mechanics, it would be a high-rated game for me. 

I would put the weight a bit higher--maybe 2.4.

RATING: 6
I'm not too excited about this one compared to other dice games released recently (King of Tokyo, Elder Sign, etc.). The dice are nice and the board is beautiful, but oversized. 

The game just didn't seem very tense and the dragon was easy to kill. Running out of dragon's lair doesn't seem like a very likely option, as the path is quite long and the dragon probably be killed before then. 

Scoring at the end of the game is somewhat long. Scoring summary sheets for each player would be beneficial.

I suppose this game could perhaps have been decent. But there are just so many things about it preventing it from being a good game. For one, the rules need some work. Another, way too much text on the cards is vague.  And once you decipher the text, you realize it just isn't very interesting.

The central mechanisms of the game are fun and interesting. Somehow it manages to be a fresh game about crawling through a dungeon and squabbling with other adventurers. But almost every aspect of the graphic design and production make it harder to play than it needs to be.

This is a good game, I actually had sooo much fun when I played it, but it really depends on the group, it could be ahuge miss, however, doing damage to the dragon can be sooo satisfying!

should be played with 4 or more, best at 5. At 3 is too easy.

Interesting concept. Unfortunately, the horrendous artwork and low card quality may be a potential drawback for some. Some house rules may be needed for a 3 player game to be as good as 5 player. Very luck based dice game with few means to mitigate the luck. Dice can really screw you over.

Purchased the game at Essen and received the painted minis for free - thank you, Eagle Games! The first thing I noticed after one playing is that the rulebook is bad (really bad!) and the player mats are uneconomical - a lot more information could have been put there (e.g. like the Game End Victory Points or the different faces of the dice). But don't let that hinder you - it's really a good game! Basically this is Yatzee overloaded with Ameritrash, chrome and a cool fantasy theme - I love it!

I find this game to be too frustrating.  If you are unlucky and roll a bunch of dragons when your turn comes around, too bad.  You may not be able to accomplish much of anything on that turn.  Too many turns are wasted due to the whim of the dice.  Also, turn order is too important in breaking ties for the actions.  If the players ahead of you roll well for the actions that you want, you might be completely locked out.  However, if you are unable to take advantage of this priority when you are high in the turn order (due to bad rolls), you can only sit and watch as the other players push you out of the way.

Despite the fact that there is just as much dice rolling in it, I much prefer playing a game like King of Tokyo.  At least there, you are almost always accomplishing SOMETHING on your turn.

I've only played with player counts of 4 and 5.  Perhaps some of the frustration will be absent when playing with only 3.  I will update my rating if I find this to be the case.

RATING: 7.5
On it's own, Dragon Rampage is a nice and light dice game. Most of your choices will come in chancing re-rolls and trying to push players out of important positions on the board. The base game rules honestly seem a little imbalanced, especially considering the way scoring is handled. We originally found the Dragon too easy too kill and it was too easy to escape the board.

So why the high rating? Well, because Mr. Launius has continued support for Dragon Rampage by providing tons of amazing free content. Dragon Rampage really shines once you start messing around with the different variants. Suddenly, a harder dragon turns a light dungeon romp into an intense scramble for survival. Having players on the edge of defeat helps bring about the semi-cooperative nature of the game. 

Overall- before the free expansions, this game was too easy to really inspire the right player interaction. Now, it is nearly perfected. There's a variant for all styles of play. I just wish we could see an official expansion one day!

This is a fairly light dice game but, the decisions aren't very interesting. With three players there is no tension in terms of the dragon killing anyone because everyone can take one of the defense slots. The game is mostly a matter of taking as much treasure as you can. Killing the dragon may be worth points, escaping may be worth points, but you know treasure is worth points.

The game suffers from the worse part of dice games (sitting and watching other people) as well as the worse part of take that games (getting picked on and dragging the end game out).

***NOTE*** 
These comments are based on the play of a prototype. 

This game is a mess.  It is a poorly thought out design and the realization of that design is even worse.  Let me explain a little about the mechanics as I am hoping the most of this audience has been smart enough to avoid.

The theme of the game is amusing.  You and your trusted adventuring party are looting a sleeping dragons' hoard; when suddenly the dragon wakes up and now it is every man for himself.  Do you enter a defensive posture? Run? Grab more treasure? Attack?  Pilfer gold from your neighbor?   Or does the dragon attack you!  The core concept of the game involves farming custom dice that have six symbols on them and then putting a token on the board of the value that you have scored on the dice, so if you rolled 3 "attacks" you place one of your tokens with a 3 on it in the Attack box.  The six things are those actions above: Defend, Get attacked, Take treasure, Pilfer, Attack dragon, run.  When rolling the "Get attacked" symbols get locked.

For most of the game you are watching the other players roll the poorly formed and painted dice.  The symbols on the dice are so poor that it is difficult to tell what you rolled, causing the turns to take a painful amount of time.   Once you farm your dice and place your tokens on the board, pass the dice and the process repeats until all have rolled.  Then the "action" happens. In the action boxes, the top two or three players get a benefit (except of course the Being attacked box).  After way too much of this, at some point the game ends, usually with someone getting out of the dungeon but as likely that deaths may end the game and less likely that you happened to slay the dragon.  

The board layout is an absolute disaster.  It wasn't well thought out.  The final board was either not playtested at all or at minimum it wasn't reviewed by intelligent people who care.  

Eagle Games you should be ashamed of yourself for allowing this to be printed as is.  I no longer wonder why you continue to fail.

You are all adventurers in a dragon's lair.  The dragon is awaken.  You either try to run away and escape the lair or slay the dragon.  On the way, you try to grab as much treasure as you can.  Depending on whether a player escapes, the dragon is slain or if a player is slain, the victory point calculation is different.

This game uses a dice rolling mechanic to determine what actions a player does as well as the degree of success.  You only perform the actions that you roll on the dice.  The more of any action you roll in comparison to what the other players roll, the greater your success.  

Each player also plays a different class.  Each class has a deck of abilities that players draw from and play.  Depending on what class you play, it will favour one strategy over the other (fight or flight).

The rulebook is not very good.  There are FAQ's available made by some players.  I had to get the FAQ to clarify some of the rules.  I highly recommend you get the FAQ's on this site.

Finally, I get to rate a game before it come out in stores.  I have played the prototype of this game twice.  From the look of the images on BGG it would seem that the game has not changed much from the version that I played.  This is my favorite of Richard's games.  I like the feeling you get as you are trying to get out as fast as you can while getting as much loot as you can.  I did not feel like I was hindered by the luck of the dice but instead that I needed to adjust how played based on what my luck provided me.

I was surprised by how much fun I had with this. There doesn't appear to be a huge amount of game there and I audibly sighed when I was told it is a Yahtzee mechanic, but it works relatively well here. Using the dice to essentially bid for action spaces is a nice little twist that makes this game fun to play, if not one to own.

Additional plays will probably highlight flaws rather than show hidden depths, but after one play, it was pretty fun.

Dragon Rampage is a nice diversion, but it does not offer enough gameplay for its length and, especially, its price. It's really random and gameplay mainly revolves around screwing with your opponents' moves. For the playing time and this kind of randomness, I would rather play King Of Tokyo or Arcadia Quest. Both these games are more streamlined and more fun.

It seems like an ok game, but it's very hard to tell through the graphic design issues-

-No victory point summary on the player boards (and plenty of space for it)
-Only PART of the symbology used in the game was explained on the player boards.
-"Black Dice" and "Yellow Dice" are keywords, but don't actually refer to the color of the dice.
-Colors on dice faces too close to each other (2 shades of blue, a yellowy-orange and an orangey-yellow) AND the different shaped borders make the symbols harder to identify at a glance.  HUGE failure there, as it adds a noticeable amount of time to games while people try to identify their dice.
-The lines for action boxes should have had an indicator that doesn't get covered up- people constantly having to move tokens off to check which line is which.
-Center circle for dragon HP should have had boxes to put the damage in, with indicators for dragon death at the various player counts.
-Cards not all self-explanatory, and no explanation in the rulebook.  We literally handed one card around the table and got 3 different interpretations of what it was saying.
-Odd card text where half the information is in a different font/size/color than the rest, seemingly at random, and certainly not in a helpful way.

and, just to be nitpicky:

-Font on cover of box not readable at a glance... Plus, no designer name on box cover.

I really think I would have enjoyed this if it didn't feel like there was a bonus 50% downtime because of the graphic design issues, and like I was wrestling with the game just to get things done when it was my turn.

Fun Yahtzee style dice rolling game. Very easy to learn and teach.  Top notch components and art for the price. I like the variable character powers and the treasure cards keep it fresh.

The negatives are long play time for this type of game and high luck factor with the dice rolling. Some take that cards maybe a turn off to some. Overall it's fun.

Dragon Rampage, a competitive fantasy game by Richard Launius, is a strategic dice game for 3 to 5 players. Each player takes the role of one of the adventurers (all with different abilities) and the goal is to score the most points at the end of the game by fighting against or running from (or some combination of the two) the dragon you just woke up, and tallying up the treasure and gold you obtain in the dungeon. Players roll seven specially designed dice and choose whether to focus on grabbing treasure (from the dragon or from another player), fighting the dragon, protecting themselves (and their treasure), or running for the exit. Try not to draw the dragon's attention as you make your way, and note that your fellow adventurers may hinder (or aid) you in your strategy and the final scoring varies depending on how the game ends, so watch your step!

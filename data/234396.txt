Lots of fun and more competitive/interesting/challenging than you'd expect. Plus the art is just amazing.

RATING: 6.5
Fun party game in the vein of Dixit where one team chooses the masterpiece card for the other team and also chooses (from 2 options) how their "muse" will have to present their clue (a pose, humming a song,  a single 3 letter word...).  The problem for the muse is that they don't see the other 5 cards offered as other options until they've given the clue for the card they've seen.  Decent fun, but didn't blow me away.

Seems like getting to know all the pictures would limit replayability, as you'd know what to watch out for (e.g. I gave jellyfish as an animal clue for a scene with mushrooms, and then got a decoy scene with actual jellyfish in it).

Its neither better or worse than Dixit. Just different. While main idea is very similar, game give significantly different experience. I would pick this over Dixit, because of team play.

+ illustrations on high quality level
+ something well known & fresh in the same time
+ team variant for Dixit-like experience
- downtime: 2/3 of a time one team is waiting for another
- phase 1 decisions aren’t so important as it seems at first

Great give-a-clue-and-guess game and enjoyed the simplified scoring compared to something like Dixit.

Played once. Need to play this more to assess; there's the potential for this to take too long if you take it too seriously, like many party games. Play fast and loose, and things will be OK. May need to introduce a timer for those that take too long to come up with a clue, or with giving out cards to the opposing team.

I think I like this better than Dixit for parties, it's a great team based game and was easy to teach. Cooperative mode is pretty fun as well.

RATING: 7
A game that builds on the base of Dixit. It makes it both a team game and a cooperative game. The rules are simple and the gameplay is fun. The art on the cards is gorgeous and the box looks great as well.

This is another "surreal art" party game. I really like the inspiration cards that force players to be creative in the kinds of clues they can give. These cards seem a little uneven (maybe just uneven depending on the group?), where some inspirations are allowed lots of information; others not so much. (For example, humming a tune is much more descriptive than offering a color of the rainbow--although, as in most things, context is king.) I really like the idea and the artwork. The framework might take a little more house ruling to make it just right.

The artwork is so beautiful. The boundaries to your imagination (compared to Dixit) sound good on paper, as you muse give a hint within a certain category. In practice they make it easier actually. Would like to play again, but it felt underwhelming...

Eine Art Dixit, nur dass ein Team dem anderen vorgibt welche Karte und auf welche Art diese erklärt werden muss.

This game wants to be a  cross between dixit and codenames, it misses the mark though in the critical area of down time.  There is a lot of sitting and waiting of the other team in this game, and it's not productive fun waiting.  It's disengage and check your phone waiting - which is death to a party game.

We had a lot of fun, no one kept scores. I could give more than 8 but i'm afraid this is one of these games that will have a expiration date. You could use dixit or mysterium cards to create more variation.

Coupd have been just another Mysterium, Dixit, etc clone, but there is a lot of room for clever clue giving. Just the right amount of hidden information. Team play is a blast!

Played at Spiel' 17. Stunning artwork, and a pretty good game around it. Shares a lot with Dixit, but now in a team-format.  Very much enjoyed this one, describing a fire with sounds only is always fun ... ;-)

tl;dr: team [thing=39856][/thing]

One team chooses an image and a card with text to give to one of the players on the opposing team. That player has to come up with the best hint for that text for the team mate to find that image. Then the image is mixed into a pile with some other images that only the other team got to see, and a choice has to be made. Correct guess: one point. Wrong guess: one point for the opposing team.
So on the one hand you try go give the opposing team the hardest combination and if you're on the receiving end, you're just trying to come up with the best possible tip. I think it really helps to know your team mate very well.
I quite enjoyed this. It's a fun take on the genre, and the art is great.

Initial rating: 6.7/10

I'm liking this one a lot.

I don't like Dixit or Mysterium, but this game brings the gameplay closer to that of Codenames. The rules are incredibly simple, consisting of a single sheet printed front and back.

I will say that the 2-12 player count is a real stretch. I will only be playing the game with 4 or 6 players, in teams of 2 or 3 respectively. Also, I've removed a couple of clue cards that seemed unfair. One card is "hum a tune" and another is "make a face." When you pair those with one of the more abstract, sparse cards, they can be almost impossible to guess. Especially when you consider that other clues are more realistic things like "name a book," "name a movie," "name a place."

Won't play the competitice game again, but will try to cooperative variant.

Too much downtime - in a 6 player game, each round 1 player selects picture and clue card (while the other 5 wait), then one player thinks for a clue (while the other 5 wait), then 2 players discuss what card to select (while the other 4 wait). The remaining 2 players don't get to do anything.

Impressive art! Game reminiscent of Dixit, except it includes cards that prescribe the kind of hint you need to give (f.i. "Use a six letter word"). This is good news for (new) players who have a hard time coming up with hints. 
And instead of Dixit's requirement that not everybody needs to understand the hint, here the challenge is that the other team gives you a card & way to describe it.

I haven't played with 4+ yet, but my wife and I greatly enjoyed the cooperative variant. This is a fun, gorgeous little game.

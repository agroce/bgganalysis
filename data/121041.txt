My first 2 plays of this game were very different experiences. When I initially played it, I found the game to be a total blast and I was thinking of rating it a 9 and saying it was the best party game since Say Anything. Yet my second play has tempered my enthusiasm slightly, because things weren't quite as awesome. However I still think it's a very good game. The concept is dead simple, you get a group of 11 cards picturing various mundane things and each player pairs them up. You score points based on how many people pair things the same as you. The magic comes in the conversations as people justify why they made a particular pairing, and then there are those surprise moments when people match you despite your shaky logic for a pairing. I'm excited about the potential of this game. It will definitely make the trip with us to a number of game nights, particularly when we have 6-8 people. A great addition to my collection.

Good party game!  It's interesting to find out how different people's minds work by hearing their explanations for why they put certain pairs together.  Good idea for a fun game.

This game is a blast to play. The fun comes in explaining why you picked the specific pairs that you did. Honestly, who cares which player wins.

Another homemade version using the pictures from the game
"Finders Keepers". This game went down well amongst a group af young adults (15-32 years). Would like the original game though since it has a better field of
nice pictures which would lead to more difficult pairing
options. All in all a unique game style that will definetly be pulled out from time to time. Like how
people justify their decisions when nobody else thought
like they did. Alot of games have this consensus scoring
technic , but you only need one game to scratch this itch. Update: Bought the original game on sale from funagain.com.

Du jeu d'ambiance pour finir. Voici une variante de Unanimo (vous savez, le jeu où il faut trouver des mots sur un thème, et on marque des points si on a pensé au même mot. Par exemple, si je dis "Evenements à la triche", vous pensez de suite à "Anniversaire, ludopathes, proteurs, troc, ... Oula, j'ai fait du spoil sur la réunion bénévole, arg !). Bon, dans qui paire gagne, il va falloir faire des paires avec des images. Si d'autres joueurs font les mêmes paires que moi, je marque des points. C'est aussi simple que ça !

We played this tonight and it went over pretty good. Every one said they would have liked it a lot more if the scoring was like scategories (you get 1 point for every pair you come up with that no one else has as long as the majority think it is a valid connection). Otherwise people were coming up with great connections and getting no points for them and it turned them off to the game a bit.

Good party game. Expected nothing less from the company that brought you the best party game, Time's Up. Can be quiet and studied, or energized and silly. Dead simple, everyone can play together. The bigger the group the better. But the box is way, Way, WAY oversized for what you get.

RATING: 7.6
In this game, 11 cards with different pictures are dealt onto the table. Then, everyone chooses two that pair up the best to make a total of 5 pairs and one "bad apple". You then get points based on how many people made the same match as you. However, if you match everybody, you get no points. I like this one quite a bit but, think the player with the lowest score should win something for being the most unique thinker of the group.

07-09-14 - Finally played at DTC2014 and wasn't too upset I'd waited so long.  Don't really even feel like saying anything about it.  It was just boring.  Perhaps with a lot of players it would be better (we had 3).  You just match up pictures and then see who else matched up the same ones - hopefully not everyone.  I don't know...  There's so many OTHER games.

I enjoyed this game more than my family, but I would like to play it with a larger group.  It is a strange concept where you look at objects and try to put them into sets.  Of course most of the time you are stretching to find something in common.  And you are even more surprised when you find out someone else was thingking the same way as you.

When I purchased this game I thought it would be fun, but it wasn't. The components are ok, the game is ok, and the idea is ok, but in reality it gets old after one play. Even then it can be iffy to many players as they just want something better.

(9/17) Drop to 6.  A great simple game to play if you've got an even number of players.  A lot of incredulous "how could you possibly match those two things?!?" at the table.  A really fun party game.

Cute.  Needs a numbered mat (see files section) for identifying the pictures easily and needs 5-round scoresheets to accommodate (coming soon, I hope).  Also needs better edited rules.  But the kids liked it.

Also needs more cards.  A lot more.

Something I play for a short time with a group between games or before everyone shows up.  It can bring some laughter to the right group or in depth though to others.  It really just depends on how far you want to take it.

The game really leaves it up to your group to make it fun with the game giving a small bump.

This is pretty fun, although there are other party games I would much rather play! 

Each round, put 11 cards on display, each with a random picture on top. Under time pressure (30-second hourglass?), players simultaneously group these into 5 pairs and one left-over. Then, announce your pairs: get 1VP per player with the same pair, unless every player has that pair. We also played with a variant where matching the odd-card-out also scored VP. To set up the next round, just flip the cards over (they're double-sided). Every odd-numbered round, you of course need a new set of cards. The player with the highest sum after 6? rounds wins.

The fun comes from seeing how and why people paired the various photos. But there are some problems:
- the cards and really tiny: bigger would be better (easier to see at distance; less likely to be totally confused about what you're looking at)
- the paper pad could use some simplification
- may not be so much fun if you aren't thinking like everyone else in the group
- the box is HUGE relative to the contents; really, you just need a deck of picture cards, a timer, and some scrap paper

It's a pretty good game, but it's hard to beat the classics!

RATING: 5.5
It's fast and highly functional.
The table talk is absolutely non coincidental to the gameplay, so the game could be played in total silence.
I wish you could challenge or vote on pairs to drive the party aspect, but that might lengthen the game for no reason.
For what it is, I would play very occasionally.

A fine descendant of Compatibility. You're trying to match with everyone, not just your partner. It's fun seeing people's stretches to make things fit, especially with certain tough sets of cards. (The screw and the eggs fit because they, uh, have a round part sort of?) After a few plays though, a new deck of cards might be welcome.

It was fun to see which cards people paired together, but I didn't love the scoring.  Since no points are scored if everyone gets the same match, one person will often not write down the obvious match.  It doesn't seem too fair that the rest of the group will score such big points for obvious answers while that lone player who was trying to think of something different will score nothing. (It could also very well be that I'm bitter about this happening to me when a statue of an angel and an astronaut both came up and I didn't score anything for my awesome Dr. Who reference and everyone else got massive points for comparing the stone statue with a stone castle.  Come on!)  Also, I wasn't too happy with the components and packaging.  The box is way too big for what you get, the scorecards could have been about half the size, and the cards were printed on fairly flimsy cardstock.

Cool party game in the vibe of Compatibility (one of my favorites) in which you compare your matches to everyone else's and just enjoy the way others' minds work. A low key party game - recommended.

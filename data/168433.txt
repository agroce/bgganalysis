What a gorgeous game. The box has copper foil accents, and miniatures are expectedly creepy and detailed, and the board has 13 rotating discs! I was craving Tzolkin just because of the giant wheels, but the gameplay didn't sound appealing for me. This game scratches that itch not only thanks to the board design, but also the beautiful additional components, the secret goals, and puzzle-ish gameplay that has you playing economic tug of war with other players.

The artistic design on this game is almost bar none. Art is definitely subjective, but the bronze, copper and gray colors, meshed with iridescent blue glass beads, and the colorful, bejeweled inventory counters really sucked me in. And I'm even initially resistant to anything steampunk with as played out as it seems whenever I go to a con or festival and see so many goggles and top hats in costumes. But the theme here is so expertly executed that it doesn't feel derivative and if anything feels much creepier than you'd expect.

When starting out, I'd recommend avoiding using the Shadow Brokers to get everyone used to the back-and-forth of the game's goals and how to win. Then for more chaos, throw in the creepy Shadow Brokers to really mess with the game mechanics. Tactile, puzzling and delightful.

Positives
- Top notch art design and component execution; you'll want to play it if you see it in person
- Simple-but-complex gameplay and goals that are easy to teach but deep to strategize with
- Rotating gears board is fantastically tactile and addictive
- Hidden victory goals obfuscates just enough
- Plays fine without Shadow Brokers
- Surprisingly creepy in tone

Negatives
- Stealing artifact card is rough; can leave it out
- Color of brown and orange ethers hard to delineate on board and don't match their corresponding pink and red resource counter gem colors
- Some may dislike lack of transparency to others' victory goals

Theme really isn't there as the game is more about the rotation mechanics than anything else. Neat little spatial game that has you rotation the various wheels to purchase coloured tokens and artefacts that you need to complete your objective. Nicely sculpted character busts for all of the player and agent pawns. Almost a little too abstract for my tastes but a very enjoyable game. Games are always incredibly close with the winner usually being just 1 turn ahead of everyone else.

The game looks wonderful and this visual impact might blind some to discovering that there is also a very good game here too. Some nice game mechanics employed and I enjoy the rotating dials on the board that keep shifting the game around even as you play it. It won't be to everyone's tastes, but with the right group this is going to be a big hit. Excellent production values from CMON (again).

One of the most unique and beautiful games out there. I could play this every week if they let me. 

It's a "stick it to you" puzzle game. There's really nothing bad I have to say about this game other than some cards are amazingly strong! With that said, you have just as good a chance of getting the strong cards as anyone else.

2015, 2-4p, 60 min.  It's an economic and puzzle-like game that is primarily a race to accomplish your hidden goal/objective.  There are rotating market (buy/sell) wheels, and action point allowance as you try to buy low and sell high, while working toward your secret objective.  ** see private comments for critiques of other BGGers **

Kickstarter edition with additional ressource Tokens

Spinning gears and trading ressources in a steampunk-setting with cool clean artwork.
I really like how the Shadowmaster's Agents change the game and add extra flavour to the game.

This game belongs to the category "The more the merrier". 2 players is ok but it feels more like a race than it should. With 4 players the board is more crowded, the gears spin faster and luck becomes strategy's partner.
Cool innovative mechanism, I like it a lot.

I was impressed with it. It had more depth than I expected, though it is still a light game. The rotating gears, getting the best out of them, without helping your opponents, is what gives it it's puzzle like nature which provides it's complexity. Must get the minis painted.

Initial impressions are very good. Upon first glance it seems more fiddly than it is. The actual game mechanics are pretty abstract, but the theme overlaid is well done and made to fit very well. Strategy is difficult with a constantly-changing board and the secret goals for each player. Part of the challenge is trying to deduce what your opponents are trying to accomplish.

Game components are very nice and meet expectations from the KS campaign information. This one will be getting lots of table time for a while.

The rating may drop a bit as the "new" wears off, but not by much.

Bit of a marmite game this one. If you love the steampunk theme and/or puzzle based "take that"games it's a definite hit. However, such games don't fit into either Ameritrash or Euro camps and as such are not to everyone's taste. But this game offers something unique to my collection and I love it. Rating given after one play but unlikely to change with further plays.  Would score higher but needs a touch more variety in the cards and agents to make it truely awesome. An expansion needed??

Interesting and pleasant first play - working out your moves was engaging and games will differ depending on the agents in play. The Shadow Master mechanism also introduces a twist to your tactical approach. 

Not sure that there is enough depth here for long term play and the ability to interfere with your opponents plans may be restricted to throwing random road bumps at them hoping they get get in the way. May have needed a little more development to get that aspect of the game working. A '7' for now but could slide down or udge up slightly depending whether it reveals any tactical depth.  

Beautifully, tending towards the 'over', produced.

CMoN continues to produce games that fall right into my sweet spot. Not one of their plastic heavy games which means gameplay is a bit more focused and centric and not as dice dependent. The market manipulation of turning the wheels is fun. The bidding for control over the first player token is pretty important as that extra action is quite a boon if you can control for a while. The way that prices close and open up and the same good costs different depending on a player's orientation to the board are incorporated nicely into the game. The theme is as plastered on as they come but it works and is atmospheric to a degree - Better than non-descript colors and drawings I'd say. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting board and actions aspect.  The "special" actions that could be picked up by rotating a dial from the center of the board seemed very powerful.  It also seems after playing once that getting and maintaining control of the start of turn and additional minions (with one additional action) was critical.  Would play it again which may either move my rating down or up a little.

RATING: 9
Unique theme and game mechanics. Only improvement could be having a special action or ability for each Gentleman. No incentive to play as different characters since they are just pawns. Lots of thought went into their design to not have them stand out from eachother in gameplay.

Component quality is an 11/10.  Gameplay is fun and unique.  Setup is short, and turns are fast.  There are a few balance issues (namely the special action cards and how often you can sue them), but you can fix those with house rules.  Without house rules, I would rate this game a 7.

蒸汽风格的游戏设定和配件都很漂亮，展示效果极佳，转轮盘作为游戏主机制很有意思。但是模型的识别性太低，八个模型摆在版图上很难一眼分辨出来。游戏本身设计得很卡，企图让你通过行动去解除这个“卡”，走到自己想到的地方。每个玩家有三个动作，全部执行完才到下一个玩家，这个点很容易造成长考，体验下来没有解谜的成就感，只是感觉到卡成狗，很不流畅。

Components are fantastic, the board is really interesting and fits the theme really nicely.  At its heart this is a simple puzzle game (but with a lot of strategy and very little luck).  I house rule the hourglasses to keep the game from feeling fiddly (seriously improves game play and reduces playtime, double + in my book).

Many, many miniatures, with lots of back-story (and I have all the KS exclusives too).  They are fun, for sure, but not really a definitive feature of the game play or experience.  The cards abilities add variability and replay-ability.

All the games I have played have been close and not swingy.

I was actually kind of surprised by how much I enjoyed the game.

An absolutely gorgeous and very intriguing puzzle game with a moderately heavy, yet simple to understand economic component. Not really my type of game normally, but this one has so much going for it that I absolutely love - the theme, the production values, the very wide variety of options that somehow are still very easy to understand and automatically lead to very tough and interesting decisions. A really great game!

The idea of rotating locations to change market prices is mildly interesting, but what you do is very basic: move around trying to buy low and (occasionally) sell high. You must collect a given set of colored "ethers" and a full set of artifacts, and then leave the board from your randomly assigned exit. There are some neutral characters that hinder or help the players, without adding much to the game. There is also a kind of auction for the privilege of moving them and being the first player, but it doesn't work very well, as money is better spent elsewhere, and the winner tends to remain the same for several rounds because of an automatic increasing bid.

There isn't a lot of room for clever play and it seems that all comes down to one or another random bit of interaction (I won my only game with two other players needing just one more action to win). But what completely ruins the game are stupid cards that allow players to steal an artifact or ether, or move someone to the other side of the board, all of which may easily prevent an opponent from winning. I played without the stealing cards and admittedly didn't have a bad time, but I rate the game as written (and I'm possibly being generous). I must mention that there is also a card that makes you physically rotate the entire board, which is not so bad from the gameplay standpoint, but can be very annoying if you don't have a lot of free space on the table.

On the production, the game definitely has a strong visual appeal with the rotating disks on the board, plastic busts and shiny bits, but functionality took a back seat. I kept confusing player characters and neutral agents, as they have the same style, even though each one has a unique color. The glass beads that pass for hourglasses hide important information and should be transparent. And a small nuisance is that the disks, instead of being fixed like in "Tzolk'in", are loose and must be placed on the board every time.

RATING: 6
Beautiful game board, spectacular minis,and a really cool Victorian Steampunk/world of Faerie back story.  The moving gears are also really cool.  But I found gameplay to be meh at best, and had no desire to bring it back to the table after a few plays.  Shadowmaster seemed like more of an investment than he was worth.  Maybe I am just not big on the "buy low/sell high" auction mechanic (which is what you have to do to keep the favor of the Shadowmaster and still be able to do anything else).  Also,we only played it with two, which could be part of our problem; a higher player count may increase player interaction and screwage (which I love). Sold

Long and convoluted for what has the strategic depth of a filler. The rotating-tile-market is interesting, but in the end is simply a small, secondary thing in this game. The game has no real focus, has weird convoluted rules which lead to little difference in decision making. Overall, it's an Amerithrash company's way of making a Euro, and it's not a pretty result.

Lots of thinking/planning required. A bit of the "Take That" aspect was found to be overpowered/too detrimental for the targeted player to be fun. For our next play we'll probably remove the "Steal one Artifact" action cards from the game. (played 2 player only)

Removed the "Steal an Artifact from another player" card and played with three. Immediately had more fun. Really enjoyed it! (Increased rating to 7)

Not my kind of game at all. The production values are fantastic, and the world presented here is very interesting, but the game is a pretty run-of-the-mill abstract with a racing element. Both of these aspects almost always turn me off to a game, and the same is true here. The Shadow Master mechanism is interesting, but it really only serves to give a little push to the furthest person behind. I think that if CMoN did another game in this world that was more of an Ameritrash-style game, I'd probably enjoy it a heck of a lot more.

Quite a nice puzzle game with innovative mechanics. The Shadow Master is a really interesting idea: everyone wants to have the advantages he provides, but this is a costly relationship to maintain, which eventually you just want to get out of! Buying this game was a total shot in the dark, but I haven't been disappointed at all. The theme feels a little wacko though and may only appeal to an even more wacko niche... This being said, there is one card that allows to steal an Artefact from another player. This card should be teared apart as it really swings the game, especially in a 2-player game. We house-ruled it to "Force another player to discard one of their Artefacts (their choice)".

One of the first games I backed on Kickstarter I was truly excited to play. First and foremost, the artwork and theme is gorgeous to behold. The character sheets, components and board are just spectacular. The design of the game is deceiving; it's relatively simple despite the moving clocks and gears. Every piece or pawn has its own ability and it impacts the strategy of every player. However, it wasn't exactly what I expected. For my own taste, On Her Majesty's Service feels more on this side of a four-way abstract puzzle than an actual game. I feel as if there is something missing, like an overall event or something. The game might be TOO simplistic but thankfully, the play time is one hour, maybe ninety minutes for instruction. Overall, On Her Majesty's Service is short, fun and beautiful to look at.

This is a cute game where players move around this ever-changing board to buy and sell potions, and collect key cards from the edges. There are also NPC characters who walk around the board, controlled by the staring player who make things difficult where they are. I enjoyed this game, the minis are nice, but ultimately it felt a little too light to me. There's a decent amount of 'take that' as the game progresses, with cards that steal critical things from the target that then allows the person who played the effect to win. All in all, I'd play it again, but I don't feel the need to own it.

Played with my 7 year old today.  It was a bit complicated for him, however he did have fun and asked to play again.  I actually enjoyed it much more this time around than my first play when I first received my KS.  For some reason it made much more sense this time around, though the instructions are definitely lacking.  I will play again with someone more in line with the recommended age and expect that I may like it a bit more and increase my rating.

[ESP] El arte de este juego es maravilloso, muy bien ambientado en el steampunk, parece super complejo por como luce pero es relativamente sencillo. Es un puzzle bastante entretenido y que se disfruta muchísimo gracias a su producción. Como queja el reglamento no es claro en varios apartados y hay que releerlo y buscar faqs.

Interesting mechanisms with several dials used to manipulate buy/sell of resources. A specific card seems unbalanced, which can be removed from the game.

"Want to play World of Smog?"

Might as well, if I can't convince you to play something else.

The gameplay itself is smooth and quite fast paced, but for me the depth of this game doesn't "hit the right nerve" to be an outstanding game. It's a good gateway game for sure, and the setting plus the component quality is out of the roof. Just not a gamer's game that I would pull out with experienced boardgamers.

I think the best player count is 3 players, because with two it lacks chaos, but with four the chaos is a bit too much! :)

The twisted steampunk aesthetic certainly enhances the game,but sadly it can be a bit tedious traveling back and forth buying low and selling high until you can finally afford to escape. Even more unfortunate are the cutthroat opportunities to slow players down even more. Could have been a much better game if there were more unique choices to occupy your time.

It's a gorgeous game with great art and beautiful pieces. I think the gameplay could have been improved by making a few artistic sacrifices, like adding the player colours to the player boards instead of forcing players to distinguish between facial characteristics of the models. Some cards felt overpowered, and controlling the shadow master is definitely more important than those of us learning realized. I'd try it again but won't be looking to add it to our collection.

I love this game. It's theme is so immersive and its mechanisms are so unique. It is unlike any other game in my collection and always presents a fun, engaing challenge to everyone I have shown it to. Has never failed at the table.

I was concerned that this might not be as fun as I'd hoped as the gameplay is pretty straightforward, but there is some screwage and the constantly changing board makes for some interesting situations.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitely something worth checking out.  The first player/Shadow Master mechanic is pretty good too where you have to decide if it's worth it to bribe the Shadow Master.  Easy, quick, gameplay and fun.  Plus the production values are very high as well and the minis look pretty good when painted.

At first I didn't think I would like this game so much, but it is unique, the art is so awesome, and the board changing itself every action taken makes it chaotic (in a good way of course).

This is a scavenger hunt/racing game set in a steampunk world.  The rulebook actually has a ton of flavor text in it to explain the story of this game but I personally wasn't that interested, especially since I found the game unimpressive.

In this game players each get two hidden cards that detail the resources they need to collect and the spot they need to be on to win the game.  The first person to accomplish this wins.  On a turn a player can take 3 actions which include buying and selling resources based on the price facing them on the board tiles and manipulating the tiles on the board to change these prices.  There are also a few special action cards and these NPC agents that move around to disrupt or even assist players.  The player each round who pays the most money to these agents gets to control them as well as other benefits like an extra action and going first.

The game ended up being very abstracted (which is strange considering the huge amount of effort they put into building up the game world and story) and in the end also kind of boring.  Just walking around a board doing basic buying and selling of resources hoping you get what you need faster than other players.  The agents and special actions add a little bit of variety to the gameplay but didn't seem that important.  The Shadow Master role itself mostly for the extra action and first player benefits was very important and kind of overshadowed (no pun intended) the rest of the game.  There was a decent amount of player interaction but with not a lot of information or ways to garner it, it didn't seem to really have much of an impact on the game.

I will say the game looks great.  Each figure is represented by a miniature bust and the tiles sit in little troughs to rotate freely.  Even the box insert nicely accommodates everything.  But it's all style over substance from the great components to the flavor text in the rulebook.  They forgot the great game.

Components are great. Could have made better choices on the brown/red ether markers. Can't really tell them apart,but they don't play a big role that requires that you can. Game plays quick but can be subject to A P by some players. Has some "Take that" or "gang up on the leader" potential if playing with more than two. Some of the cards can feel overpowered but too soon to tell if they really are. Need to play multi player to see if they still feel that way. A keeper regardless of flaws.

Such a simple game to play and with great production value that I've come to expect from CMON. The sculpts are very detailed and the set of foil cards are top notch. If you watch the video of the game being played, you know exactly what you are getting into and it makes it easy to decide if this is your type of game or not. There is a "take that" element in the game which is in theme with the game. If you don't like that, this may not be your type of game.

Played it and had fun, but too much happens without communication which makes it a quiet game to play. Almost zen-like, which counteracts the aesthetic and where the lore is trying to take you.

An interesting if slightly problematic design. We played it without the theft cards (stealing keys) on the recommendation of a friend that had played it before. I looked at it afterwards and can see why they'd want to do that, those cards just seemed over powered in terms of action point efficiency - the swing between the thief and victim is massive. I liked the theme and the rotating puzzle it was hard to process at first but I managed to understand it after a few rounds.

Lavish production in an intriguing steampunk setting, the gameplay straggles a strangle line between abstract strategy and economic engine and take-that gameplay. So, it's likely an acquired taste. I like it (and the look certainly helps).

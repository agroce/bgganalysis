RATING: 10
Challenging farming game with variability and a sense of urgency and strife. Best value for money out of all the games I've bought.

A 9 after first playthrough and a 10 after the second. Like it even more after the third play!

4 Plays and it feels like this might be the best game in the world!

Like it even more after a fifth very tight game (41 to 42)!

Connection between theme and mechanics makes it easy to teach too! Great with two, great with three. Can't wait until they release a revised edition of Farmers of the Moor!

This will always stay in my collection and all future euros I play will be measured against this great game.

Agricola is close to the ultimate worker placement. Competition over the best spots is fierce and you never quite get to accomplish everything you want in a game. The need to feed your family after each harvest puts pressure on you and creates a natural limit for growth. When the game first came out back in 2008, the theme was refreshing since there were not too many games about farming. To be honest, I was not too excited about the theme at first, and the initiation game was a sore multi hour experience of down time. But it did not take long before I embraced the game, and as of this writing (2017) I think the theme is pure gold.

The absolutely best part of the game are the occupation cards, since without them Agricola would be just another soulless worker placement game. The cards allow for a myriad of strategies and no two games play the same and I actually find the initial analysis of the cards the most fun part of the game. Your analysis gives you a long term plan to follow and helps with tactical choices. This is something I am always seeking after in all games, i.e., a balance between tactics and strategy. Agricola offers both.

Bought it after lots of doubts and we love it! The only downside is ruthlessness of the game - a lot of penalties and few similar work spaces.
Still, I love to see how my farm grows, Like that cards make every play different. Love to be able to see a combo and implement it.

-> need more Mayday Euro premium sleeves. Paint on cards is chipping :(

Deep, thick, brain-grinder of a euro dedicated to pure optimization and efficiency, wrapped in a 16th century farming theme.  Don't let the notion of farming turn you off.

Three games were solo, one was 4p, the rest were 2p. A beautiful game that I want to explore more. I've enjoyed my plays a lot.

I'll start this at 9. It can go up or down but I really need to play this at all player counts before I can give my full opinion on it. As things currently stand, I'm impressed by Agricola.

After my first play with 4 players, I can safely say that this game deserves its high popularity and average rating. Seems to be a true classic.

Drei Jahre intensiv nachgedacht. Viel zu viele Spiele gekauft, um festzustellen, dass ich viel früher zu diesem Meisterwerk hätte greifen sollen. Caverna war schon interessant, aber Agricola bietet in meinen Augen noch mal mehr. Neben dem Spielmechanismus, muss man auch die tolle Ausstattung und die thematischen Illustrationen ausdrücklich loben. Wir werden viel Spass mit diesem Meisterstück haben und warten auf die Moorbauern, die vermutlich auch für diese Version erscheinen werden. Great Job Mr. Rosenberg!

RATING: 10
This is game is very tough compared to Caverna. In Caverna you have plenty of places to go to, there's not so much pressure on getting food for your people.
In Agricola you're constantly struggling with action places, with resources, with getting enough food, in Agricola you have to pre-plan your move much more carefuly than in Caverna.

This is much more difficult and stressful than Caverna, but at the same time almost forces you to become a better player each time you play.

Component quality is not as good as Caverna, the grain, vegetable, wood, reed, clay and stone resources are a bit too thin compared to some of the same resources in Caverna.

Also a minus if the fact that original Agricola was 2-5 players and had loads of diferent cards, now the game is 1-4 players and has way less cards that were picked as being the best selection among thousands of cards already available for Agricola (with expansions).

You can buy an expansion that enables 5-6 players.

RATING: 9
I played Caverna before I played Agricola, and thought for the longest time I didn't need the original. However, it turns out that Agricola is a game much more to my liking - it's much tighter and I find the puzzle aspect of figuring the best way to leverage your cards more intriguing. Caverna just feels too much of a sandbox in comparison. Anyhow, Agricola is still one of the best worker placement games ever made.

Agricola is back with a new edition, and I couldn't help myself: I had to buy it as soon as it hit the shelves!
What I love about Agricola is still here: its tightness, the pressure it puts on players, the constant need of one more action like grasping for air.

What's new in this edition? One less player (at least until 5-6 players exp. arrives), less cards (but they're tweaked by the online community, and the duds and broken cards were removed), better and rationalized components (I love the new foldable 1-piece central board), better rules with lots of new variants... at a cheaper price point!

Probably not needed since I already owned the previous edition, along with tons of decks and pimping... but not needed isn't applicable to the 'Gric...

RATING: 8
Wow, this game lives up to its reputation. The cards are the key, in my opinion, to its excellence. They are varied in what they provide a player and each hand can offer interesting synergies if played correctly. 

The game plays quickly (about 45-60 minutes for 2 players, excluding set-up time) and has tension throughout. The tension is largely due to need to feed your "family" and the limited action spaces that, if blocked by an opponent, can cause you to delay your plan or move onto plan B. My wife is still unsure whether she likes the cards or not (she's leaning towards not liking them), so this rating can go up or down depending on her ultimate decision. Her decision will be a key component in how much Agricola will hit the table. She seems to want to be more self-determined in her strategy as opposed to her strategy being highly influenced by the hand of cards.

RATING: 10
I can see why this one is always brought up when talking about the best eurogames.  It simply is a fantastic game, no two ways around it.  The gameplay is tight, the game is pretty easy to teach, but there is a ridiculous amount of complexity once you dig into optimum play.  If I could only have one game on a desert island, this one would be on the short list.

Very thematic worker placement game and one of the first complex game I own. I really feel like a 17th century farmer trying to make ends meet every harvest. Balancing between expanding my farm and ensuring my workers don't starve makes me feel like I'm in a pressure cooker which I love. Very tense game, so many things to do, so little time. The restrictive nature is exactly why I love the game, it rewards you for doing a bit of everything and optimizing it instead of a sandbox nature. There's nothing more satisfying than looking at the completed farm at game's end and knowing your workers didn't need to resort to begging. Keeper.

// Well, I decided to upgrade to the newer Mayfair printing

My second favorite euro after COB and my favorite solo game. The solo play is like a well oiled machine. I've mostly played solo so my rating is deterministic of that. 

Slight frustration when running into AP and spot-blocking in a multiplayer game but this can be avoided by playing 2p and tossing in the variant tile that adds another wood and another family growth spot.

The rating of 7 is purely for the reduced number of cards. They might be more balanced, but when I saw how many occupations were left after just one 3-player game, I knew this wasn't gonna go in my collection unless more extensions come out.

LE: With 6 expansions on the way, I think the rating for this one will go up. Depends on how balanced these expansions are. I might even buy the game (and expansions) instead of the original one.

Stayed away from this one for a long time due to the unappealing theme but I admit I was wrong! Such a great game that's very stressful on the players trying to accomplish everything they need to do while making sure to produce enough food to feed your workers. The components in the revised edition are top notch and I love that the cards are all really good and won't handicap a player due to a bad draw. Highly recommended for all Euro gamers.

Finally got a chance to play this classic and I can see why so many people enjoy it. The combination of nowhere near enough turns to do what you want, the constant feeling of not being able to feed your farmers, and the variability with the cards make for a challenging game that really has you thinking throughout. For me I enjoy this better than Feast for Odin because it does have those constraints and forces you to puzzle it out instead of doing whatever you want, but it still suffers from the constant upkeep round over round. I want to try this again to see how much the cards really do change my strategy because I do worry about the category scoring requiring you to still diversify somewhat in order to do well.

The mechanics of the game are unimpeachable; it didn't get its reputation for nothing. Thing is, the theme just does nothing for me. For worker placement, I much preferred "Above and Below," which incorporated a nifty "Choose Your Own Adventure" element into the mix. That's not to say "Agricola" is bad, but it'll never be my main squeeze because of the blandness of the theme.

Agricola has too significant of a luck element based on which cards you start with, which is diminished but not eliminated through a card draft. It is too easy to be a kingmaker in various situations, especially with three players. Nonetheless, the strategy requires a lot of forward-looking.

This allows them more actions.Players will plant grain and vegetables while supplementing their food supply with sheep, wild boar and cattle.

First game for me.
Played a 3 hours and 40 minutes game. 
So many choices but only 2 workers in first stages. Ended up with a field full of vegetables (+8 grains 5 pumpkins harvested) 3 workers, some fences, but 0 animals. Had 2 ovens technically ( a stone oven and the Well).
As occupation cards, played first Tutor, after 4 more to score 4 point. 

Aldo i had no animals and struggled with food all games I managed to finish with 33 points (2nd place), 1st place had 36 and last 29.
======================================
Conclusion : Well the game lives up to it's prestige. The mechanics and theme are well rounded. I have to admit :It's a good game.
But I will not buy this game due to the increased time it takes to play and high complexity of choices that one can make and has to think of. The social aspect (speaking) will revolve around how and what the opponent did. Much of time you will be thinking your strategy and calculating the food, thinking how to arrange the animals , what to grow on fields etc. If you include a timer (hourglass)indeed the game will end faster but definitely it will introduce frustration and anger , squeezing all fun and joy with friends. I feel this game creates tension and my family which i usually play with would not approve.
===============================================
Will play again if offered the possibility :D

[b]Decent version of Agricola for those who don't plan on play it often.[/b]

I'm going to rate this an 8, even though I rate Agricola a 10 as my all-time favourite game. Why? The card pool for 2p (which is the number I most often play with) is simply too small for heavy play.

The GOOD changes:
+ Artwork for the Occupation and Minor Improvement cards now has very pleasant background images.
+ Scoring is now printed on the board (but fairly small, and sideways...)
+ There are several variant side-boards that allow for slightly less cutthroat play which is a real plus for everyone I play this with. [b](NOTE: For 2p, at least, the variant board can be implemented by those of us with the original version of the game, with a small modification.)[/b]
+ All "eeple" are provided in box.
+ Better wording and iconography makes the game a bit easier to teach than the old version.

The BAD changes:
- The "eeple" are a lot thinner than the excellent Goodies expansion eeple.
- Very small card-pool, especially for 2p.
- I don't care for the 5x multiplier chits. I preferred the old versions better.

So why the 8 if there are more good changes than bad changes? The smaller cardpool is a dealbreaker for me. I'll wait for 2017's Collectors Edition.

Scales well with different player counts. Lots of places to put your workers down so it doesn't always feel like you're being blocked. All sorts of fun with many different ways to play.

Highly recommended.

Excellent edition of this game. One thing that was overwhelming with the old edition was just the vast selection of cards and dealing with how some of them were worded. However, this edition deals with all of that nicely. Fewer cards, edited very well, and they are the best of the bunch. I have to give this version higher marks because it's a good game, made great!

I had to edit this and rate this a 10. The more I play, the more I love this game. Runs neck and neck with Concordia as my favorite.

The redesigned board is a definite improvement; the modular pieces eliminate fiddling, the information design is excellent, and you even get additional mini add-on boards for popular variants. The new rulebook is very clear and well-structured; looking up things is now a breeze. The new cards also benefit from the improved info design, it’s just that there is only a small deck of them; this is the only negative thing I can say about the new edition. Oh, and the meeples are lovely.

Took the decision tonight, that it was the last time I played this game. Ever! 

It is a really good game, but it just makes me feel like sh*t. If you are not 100% effective, the game will tell you when you have two workers and the other players have 3 or 4 each, and still has a good amount of goods and food lying around. I really don't like the mechanism of letting you have less actions than the other players, for playing bad or sub-optimal, let me atleast play the game "in full"... And don't get me started on the tight quest for food!
 
This is the most angst-inducing Euro (and I love Euro-games!) I have ever come across.... The game it simply too punishing, and I feel true discomfort playing it!

Somehow i like the game mechanics, but i absolutely hate the feeling of the game. Ohh my boy look how beautiful pet we have, i hope you love him so much. But now after we loved him hard time comes and we must kill it to have something to eat... Another thing is that i feel like the game finishes too early i haven't got enough time to finish the things that i want to.
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
Because a lot of player suggested so after the revised edition came out i tought why not give it another chance. The bad feeling i have had before completely gone and i started to enjoy the game quite much. The revised edition has fewer cards but they put into the box the most balanced ones so it is a welcome upgrade of course. They reworked the art which becomes more beautiful however i didn't have a problem with the old one. Unfortunatelly the production quality of the game board dropped quite a bit and with the attaching thing can be damaged very easily. There are not enough resource tokens we ran out of wood and brick in numerous occasions. Because of this im thinking about getting the old version instead. I believe this game has a very high replay value because every game is different by what actions you proceed and what cards you are dealt in the start. It seems that there are numerous strategies to pursue which all capable of winning the game in the end. A little bit bigger player interaction would be nice though. I think this was an outstanding game when it came out but there are simply better games nowadays.

Below all that fiddlyness and heavyness, Agricola is just an average resource management game. A bunch of cards won't improve a game, just as «the suit doesn't make the man».

Wow. I just opened this to organize the components and to play a learning solo game so that I could teach my friends later. I wasnt even planning on playing the whole solo game but I got a bit carried away. 

This game is unlike anything Ive personally played before. The board is incredibly unique - I havent heard anyone talk about this so Ill try to sum it up: the game itself emulates growth and development. Crops and animals accumulate, as time passess the whole board grows and changes in a variety of ways - its like a living organism. Very interesting - cant wait to play it with others but the solo game was very enjoyable!

Mennyiben változott az Agricola Hobbi az eredeti Agricolához képest?
-	Az új kiadást maximum négy fővel lehet játszani az eredeti 5 főhöz képest.
-	A táblákon kisebb változtatások vannak rajzokban, kicsit más a grafikai megjelenítése. 
-	A főtáblán baloldalon a plusz kártyahelyek helyett egy kétoldalas, puzzle-szerűen hozzárakható táblarész van, amire segédletet nyomtattak, amiken az akciók és a pontozás van. A táblán több és egyszerűbb ikon, kevesebb  szöveg van, illetve néhány akciónak új neve van. 
-	Nagy fejlesztéseknél nincs változás.
-	A mesterség és kis fejlesztés kártyákban van a legnagyobb változtatás. Az eddigi "E" „K” és "I" pakli helyett "A" és "B" pakli van. A lapok a régi kiadás és a kiegészítők lapjainak válogatása. 
-	A kártyák szövegei át lettek fogalmazva, nagyobb betűtípussal készültek a kártyák. 
-	A kockák és korongok helyett már minden fa alkatrész úgy néz ki, mint amit megszemélyesít, tehát az állatok állat alakúak, a nyersanyagok fa, kő stb. alakúak, a családtagjaink is figurák a korongok helyett. 
-	Kapunk további akciómezőket kapunk a játékhoz kiegészítésként
Érdemes-e  az eredeti Agricola mellé beszerezni az új kiadást?
Olvastam olyan rajongót, aki az eredeti mellé megvette az újat is, és azóta csak azzal játszik, de az eredetitől nem válik meg, mert annyira megszerette. Én ezt némileg túlzásnak érzem, egy átlag játékosnak vagy az egyik vagy a másik kiadás bőven elég. 
Érdemes-e lecserélni az eredeti kiadású Agricolát az új kiadásra?
Ha valaki szokott rendszeresen Agricolázni 5 fővel, akkor egyelőre semmiképpen sem, mert még nincs meg az új kiadás 5 fős kiegészítője, illetve nem tudni, hogy az lesz-e magyarul. Ha valaki szebb kiadású játékot szeretne, igazi zöldség, nyersanyag és állat meeple-ökkel, és maga is sokallta a rengeteg kártyát, akkor igen, érdemes cserélni. Ha valaki már feljavította az eredeti kiadását ilyen meeple-ökkel, esetleg vett már egy-két kiegészítőt is, akkor neki nem nyújt annyit az új játék, hogy érdemes legyen cserélnie. 
Ha nincs Agricolája valakinek, akkor inkább a régit vagy az új kiadást érdemesebb-e beszereznie?
A régi kiadás a maga rengeteg kártyájával csak gémereknek, igazi Agricola rajongóknak való, akik esetleg néhány gyengébbnek titulált kártyát is jól ki tudnak használni adott esetben. A több kártya egyértelműen több változatosságot ad a kevesebbhez képest, tehát ezért is való a régi kiadás az igazi Agricola rajongóknak.ha valakinek még nincs meg, vagy még nem is ismeri a játékot, akkor annak mindenképpen érdemesebb a letisztultabb, szebb külsőt kapott Agricola Hobbit beszerezni.

As a solo game its ok, but I find it too much of a dry mechanical optimisation exercise, but there are a lot of options to explore. Particularly when you add the Artifex deck.

Much preferred it as a 4 player game. When to me it becomes a game as you have to think about your fellow players and scrape every advantage you can.

It is an intuitive, easy to understand but very long game. It is more complex and strategic, as you might think first. In the gameplay you have to feed your workers, otherwise you'll get big minus. Nevertheless, you are still free in your workplace placement and have a great variety to go for victory points, especially with the extensions.

However having played the family version it's helped enormously, now I can fully appreciate the 'big game'. Love the names of some of those occupation cards, who wouldn't want a sheep whisperer to come and help out on your farm? Can't wait for a 3 or 4 player game.

An improvement on the original. The minor tweaks are for the better and the card decks are now more balanced.

This revised edition has the bonus of many wooden playing pieces all shaped to match their use. 
It has less cards than the original versions but I have not seen it as an issue as there is plenty of choice in this version. Some of my friends prefer to play without the cards anyway!
Although it seems an involved game when first reading the rules, a couple of ‘how to play’ videos online will soon have you playing with confidence.

RATING: 7
Comparing with the Z-man edition, the occupations and minor improvements felt more balanced but at the same time more subdued. It's harder to get those crazy card combos going with this edition. However I don't understand Mayfair's decision to also reduce the overall number of occupations and minor improvements. Almost every card is in play if you play it with 4 players. The board is an improvement for me since its now adjustable based on player counts.

I love how hard this game is with few and thematically logical mechanics. You have to get the right resources at the right time, planning turns ahead, or a hard punishment will come from other players if not from the game itself. The initial random cards drafting and deck building phase completes the puzzle and ensure variability and replayability, while still keeping the luck factor very low. It's all about skill in a perfect thematic way. Can't wait for revised expansions. [***Fantasy Flight sleeve size: Standard European - Purple (FFS04, 50/pack) - (2-5/16” x 3-9/16" - 59 x 92mm)***]

I love the feeling of being a peasant as i struggle to eek out a simple existence. The paths to victory are plenty, but adapting to your cards is what will give you an edge against your competition.

2017-03-04 - 7.5 - I think I prefer this one over Le Havre (which is good too). It's quicker and you can get food while doing other things which can lead you to many points.

2017-05-10 - 7.5->7 - Still I like it slightly more than Le Havre, and it is pretty good game which I will gladly play almost any time, but there are games around this genre which I like more (like Tzolk'in).

Had Agricola for almost a decade.  Been playing the revised version since its release in 2016.

I prefer the Revised edition better.  Cleaner setup, the additional actions helps keep people from using the same strategies over and over and over and over again.  

I rarely if ever played with 5 players, so its nice to have the expansion separate.

While i miss the 169 occupations, I'd usually only rely on certain ones to pop up and ignore the rest.   With the revised edition, I find myself considering all of the occupations as viable strategies.   Can't wait to see what Print & Play cards fans come up with.

Szerintem kimondottan jót tett ez a frissítés az Agricolának. Nem mondhatnám, hogy olyan sokat játszottuk az eredeti kiadást, hogy a kártyákról, illetve azok használhatóságáról érdemben nyilatkozzak, de alapvetően közelebb áll hozzám a "legyen kevesebb lap, de azok legyenek használhatók, kiegyenlítettebbek" elv.
A dizájnon kicsit korszerűsítettek, a szabálykönyv sokkal jobb, átláthatóbb, könnyebben emészthető lett. Az ötfősség számomra sohasem szempont, ilyen nehézségű, játékidejű társasokat nagyon nem szeretek 3-4-nél több fővel játszani, szóval ha ezzel kicsit lehetett faragni az árból, akkor a többség jól járt ezzel a döntéssel, főleg, hogy így benne van a dobozban a sok formára faragott fajelölő is, amit korábban csak külön lehetett megvenni, és azok bizony meg tudták dobni a költségeket.
Maga a játékmenet nem változott, viszont valahogy most már közelebb áll hozzám az egész. Rengeteg kipróbált játék után teljesen világos most már az Agricola népszerűségének oka. Nagyszerű játék.

Masz dwóch chłopków robisz dwie akcje, w czasie gry zwiększa się ilość akcji do wyboru. Zaorać i obsiać pole, upiec chleb, rozmnożyć inwentarz itp. Co kilka rund są żniwa. Duża liczba kart (akcji) ale tylko część z nich w każdej grze będzie dostępna (duża regrywalność), są też dostępni pomocnicy ze specjalnymi umiejętnościami. Trzeba też chatę rozbudowywać a wtedy po erotycznej akcji ;) ma się już trzech chłopków i więcej nimi da się zrobić. Punkty na koniec są prawie za wszystko (zwierzątka, pola, pastwiska, izby w chacie i ich rodzaj, zdobyte punktujące usprawnienia, chłopków itp.) Bardzo przyjemne komponenty drewniane zwierzątka, dynie, snopki, surowce itp. Niezły tryb solo.

I was one of the first 500 to order this game from Z-man. I figure that makes me special, right? Because of this we got the meeples from the beginning, so the game was always very attractive. It was a horrible disappointment for our gaming groups though. The cards have always seemed imbalanced. I recently adopted the Revised Edition because every once in a while, I still feel like running a farm. I like that everything fits into one box with the revised edition. I don't like that I had to buy the family version as a separate game, since it was included in the original release.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The revised edition doesn't have the card variety (yet) of the original, but the revisions have gone a long way to making this classic approachable for a whole new generation of gamer.  Instead of being presented with a myriad of cards (the most daunting aspect of Agricola for new players), players are instead given a more manageable amount that stands a much strong chance of comboing.  

After all, that is the spice that brings Agricola above all others, the cards.

If you are on the fence, give this one a shot.  It is considered a classic for a reason.

If you're of the older edition camp, wait until this one gets the second deck of cards and then jump ship.  You'll be happy you did.

El juego como tal sigue siendo tan bueno como la edición original del Agricola. Pero para mí esta edición es pero que la original. Han eliminado al quinto jugador para sacarlo en una expansión. Han quitado cartas, con lo que han eliminado parte de la jugabilidad, aunque sigue siendo teniendo muchas partidas. Han quitado el modo familiar, que a mí me servía incluso para jugar al Agricola con gente nada acostumbrada a juegos de mesa modernos. Los componentes de madera han mejorado (excepto las vallas) pero hay pocos. En concreto del recurso madera siempre íbamos cortos y la única loseta x5 también se nos quedaba corta.

Resumiendo:
Si no puedes conseguir la edición antigua pero te interesa este juego, pilla esta edición porque el juego lo merece. Pero la edición original es mucho mejor.

Challenging and rewarding with escalating tension.  Lots of variety with starting cards keep each play feeling fresh, though many of those cards are only used in 3+ player games, unfortunately.

I like this version better than the original. Fifth player was cut, so what? With four the game already feels like a struggle to make ends meet. Three players is fine and so is two when played casually, competitively blocking isn't my definition of good time. I also enjoy the trimmed and balanced deck. Still I only give Agricola six stars, good game for sure, but just not that fun.

Very nice. Love to have Agricola in Finnish. The changes in the new edition are generally mostly for the good.

I'll still count plays under the regular Agricola, because in the end, it is the same game.

Enthusiastic.

I traded away Caverna, while I love it, the game totally lacks the tension which makes euros interesting for me. Agricola with the feeding phase looming and the combo via the cards is in my opinion a much better game. Love the worker placement "growth" over the game, and how hard it is to manage everything. You are required to do everything well in this game, and the tension because of that and the feeding really makes the game one of the best classics for me

Believe it or not, I was actually a bit annoyed at some of the components. The wheat isn't as thick as in Caverna, so it makes it stack better without taking as much space...but in exchange, they made it so paper thin, its hard to pick up. And that's really annoying for something meant to be an upgrade. The original circular pieces may have been easier to pick up. The distinguishment and bigger cattle was a nice touch...but the pieces were a bit more annoying. The wooden person instead of the circular disk is nicer thematically, but its harder to imagine one as a baby since it looks like an adult. But that's a smaller nitpick.

The board was nice looking, but I found the iconography in some places harder, like telling which card for minor improvement or occupation and wish it just said it (I'm semi color blind). Then the extra 2 tiles in 2 player was annoying to deal with since I couldn't tell where they were meant to fit. (if there is a good fitting designated spot, please do tell). And I didn't see any summary cards or anything versus the original, in the box we played with.

Gameplay was same as original Agricola. The board looked better, but I do not necessarily know it played better. There are a lot less cards too from what I can tell.

Anyway, overall a mediocre experience. Glad I tried so I know not to buy. Also I wish they had a better way of counting up points than those papers included in the box (with no pencil? We played away from home so it was actually a little annoying - but that's more a nitpick of mine since the experience was so disappointing overall).

I feel they didn't go very far to make it very beginner friendly. Why remove the back family side?

Massively upgraded UI removes unnecessary walls of text, cleans up the setup, and reduces the management overhead. 

I was wary about the heavily reduced number of cards at first, but now that I have once again seen some huge luck-of-the-draw swings in the original edition, I am very interested in seeing how well the advertised "balanced deck" in this new edition works.

Also, the rulebook seems to have been significantly improved, even though some of the changes in the basic terminology (e.g. renaming family growth) are a bit strange. And this edition has both animeeples and veggiemeeple by default (even though they are too skinny). Removing the fifth player is also a bonus point in my book.

The revised edition is a cheap market trick - they've slashed the card count, which is the heart of the game, setting buyers up to be hooked into buying lots of expansions just to get the base game back up to where it should. Buy the original if you can!

After leaving me frustrated during first two plays, the third one found me in a better mood and I understood the game. After that one, I had two horrible games and again became angry as you can become. Sixth game was a really good one again, as was seventh. I can say I know how to handle my farms and animals these days.

In Agricola (latin for Farmer) you play as a Farmer's family with the task to grow your farm, plant fields, herd sheep, pigs and cattle and even raise a family.

Because of the different hand cards, you need a different strategy each game. Resources are rare, so the player needs to work his way around.

Everybody I've played with loved it so far. And so do I.

A better version of Agricola for me (less cards to muddle through) - though I kind of miss my stickered discs from the original set. Also carrots are now pumpkins :(. 

Agricola is the essential backbreaking euro. Can you feed all of your people?...not really, but somehow you do it. I love how hard the choices are in this game and how well the player interaction works in accordance with that. I prefer this to the looser system of Caverna.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I like Agricola a lot, so I'm giving this the same score. Because it is really the same. The board is a bit better developed, some of the cards are new to me, so are new or come from promo-decks I don't have, but the rules are exactly the same, you only get a lot of possibilities on how to distribute the occupations and minor improvements at the start of the game.

But if I had known what I know now, I wouldn't have bought an extra copy. The 'old' one is just fine imho.

Well, I was never that much of a fan of the game (I mean, some people are crazy about it), but this version is definitely a step back. There is no change I can think of that I find really appealing. Less cards, less components, unnecessary changes, even the disks are missed. 

But no wonder though. It is, according to the publishers, "meant for Agricola players who play the game maybe three times a year" (literally. You can find the quote here: http://play-agricola.com/forums/index.php?topic=4507 ).

Yep, that's surely right. I can't imagine myself playing this version more than twice.

Congratulations Mayfair, mission accomplished!

This is the new edition of this classic board game, and I´m very happy to got it into my collection. Somehow it´s a little bit controversial, as it brings fewer components, although these´re so beautiful. Playing with this new edition is a delight, but sometimes we run out of some meeples when we play with 4 players. We usually play "Agricola" 2 players, although on weekends there´re some 4 players games in my group. Anyway, it isn´t a big problem at all. It´s a little bit "euro-mathy-heavy-boardgame" for some of my friends´ taste (they use to say: "this game is cold as ice, man!") and, because I use to win, now they don´t want to play it, and prefer to try other games... :-(

It's good ol' Agricola, but with a few updates in the graphics department. The colours on the board are richer, the fonts bigger and you also get ginormous farmer meeples to replace the bland discs from the original edition. The veterans in my group also claim that the new deck (which is a mix of old and new cards) is more balanced, so I'll take their word for it.

It's [i]still[/i] good ol' Agricola though, which means I remain remarkably rubbish at it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I like Agricola well enough, but it’s never been a favorite game.  The cards were always the issue for me.  If they are just dealt out, it’s possible that one person ends up with fantastic combinations and others end up with absolutely nothing that works well together.  The solution is to draft them, but that takes time and isn’t really feasible for newer players that aren’t really familiar with the various options and strategies available in the game.  This revised edition of Agricola offers a great compromise in that the card deck has been curated to include the most liked cards from all of the expansion and fewer different cards overall.  Just dealing out the cards results in everybody getting mostly different cards, and also cards that will combo well together in some useful way.  This adds variety in that each player may have a different strategy based on the cards dealt, but it also evens out the game in that each player has more or less has a hand of equally powerful cards.  This is the biggest change in the revised edition and one that I highly welcome.  The rest of the game played and felt like the same Agricola that so many people already know and love.  If I were to add Agricola to my game collection, then it would definitely be this revised edition.

Pros:
- Challenging and rewards well-thought-out plans
- Great art and components
- Fun theme
- Good replayability with cards

Cons:
- Not a lot of overall variability in strategy - everyone has to do everything at least a little bit to keep from losing points
- The game often feels like it ends 2-3 turns before you're able to finally get your engine going

One of my absolute favorite worker placement games. The theme may seem boring at first, but I think it's a ton of fun, and I always feel like every single action I take really matters. If I lose, it's usually because my opponent played a better game.

Tension. Tension. Tension. Caverna has the sandbox/dowhatyouwant/throwineverything feel to it, while humble Agricola is just, well humble Agricola. Is it the cards? They are awesome, and I particularly like how they function in solo campaign mode, but Caverna has the buildings which are equally as cool.


It really comes down to the tension. Some loathe it for it's oppressiveness, but I love it. How in the world am I ever going to get this and that done and feed my people and manage to do all that while outdoing my opponent? But when you do, somehow, it's a rewarding experience. And when I don't? Even better, I just want to try and try again.

Fun game but the rulebook is not very friendly.  Descriptions could be more streamlined and the game would really benefit from a beginner's walkthrough turn by turn.  We played a lot of minor things wrong (or simply forgot them) our first time through, despite checking the rules frequently.  Did not use the cards the first game (as suggested in rules) and cannot imagine how much more complicated it would get with them.

Have not felt interested enough to try this one again after the first play.  Waiting for ACBS in hopes that it's a less cumbersome 2 player experience.  Keeping, but one we may sell someday.

This game gets better as we play it more. As we are getting more comfortable with the game, we are focusing more on better use of all the cards we have, trying to make the best use of everything we have in our hand and in front of us. Its wonderful how the game felt rewarding to us when we played - rather stumbled round trying to play it- the first time - and now as we are slightly better at it, we still feel rewarded after each game. Wonderful!

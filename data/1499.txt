Points deducted for not being playable if you have a life.  But what fantastic game systems are lurking here - the naval system and the production system are particularly impressive.

RATING: 5.5
Naval system: very good, but not quite perfect. 9/10
Air system: mediocre. Has some good points, but also some problems. 6/10
Land system: bad. Produces static slugfests wayyy too easily. 2/10

Therefore PTO is 7/10
ETO is 4/10

Total is 5.5/10

I own the 5th ed. and do not want to ugrade because I feel the new rules/components detract from the game. I've played this about 5 times over the years and still think it's the best WWII strategy game; if you can play once a week for a few months. Some parts of the rules can be a bit tiresome to work through, and a SIMPLER version not an EXPANDED system would make the game an all time great.

Played this one to death when it came out.  Great game with lots of production choices.  Allies have to be patience and not get too discourage by early losses.  The Axis strategy is decide on when to launch Barbarosa or just try to knock the Brits out.

Never yet played to completion.  My rating is for the 5th edition which I play with the Ships in Flames and Planes in Flames expansions.  Admittedly, later editions integrate all of the rules into one package but I hate the new style maps.  Love the counters and the production spiral.  Simply the best WWII game I've seen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Have only tried the (air/land) Barbarossa introductory scenario so far (as the Russians - it is the Germans that have the work to do). 

Daunting rule/scenario book and certainly different mechanics to many games but once into the rhythm it is not too bad - a patient mentor certainly helps though. 

Plays very well via Cyberboard.

Definitely one of may favourite games - but more small scenarios would be nice (for the novice).

How I wish I could find the room to play this.  I' first saw it being played as 4th edition or thereabouts, back in my University days.  Although I was playing a different game at the time, I would go over and watch this game being played whenever I got the chance.  I now own 5th edition and Finakl edition with a few of the expansions thrown in.  Problem is I don't currently have the space or time to play.  And VASSAL isn't really an answer due to still not having the time.  Maybe one day.....

Played a game with others 'tutoring' me. I didn't really understand it, except that even people who had played 5+ times (at days each play) still had to refer to the rulebook. Way too long for my tastes, but given the devotion it inspires I suspect that this is one of those "Love it or hate it games" and if you like long wargames and WWII, you should probably try it.

I played several WiF games, both in its first encarnations and, then, after PiF and MiF were released. Haven't played with other expansions, though, but for what I've read it has become somewhat unbalanced as a result. Anyways, if it is again available I will buy it. It is a collector piece that can't be missed in any serious wargamer collection.

One of my constant gripes is that we do not like games that tax our brains too much, which is why Memoir '44, Battle Cry, and the like will always rank high, while other, more thoughtful, more challenging games will be lower on the list.  World in Flames does not challenge you, rather, it drives you insane.  The rules are truly incomprehensible, the components are not as good as the could have been, and the map is buttttttttttt-ugly.  I sold mine at a loss and still came out ahead.  

It is like the ADG decided to scheme against all of us who actually liked AH's Rise & Decline of the Third Reich.  "Let's take the same idea, include the Pacific Theatre, and then make an colourful, expensive, mish-mash of a game to drive them insane!"  Well, much like Superman exposed to Krytonite (spelling?), I had to dump this baby before it sucked all the life out of me.

I love this comment from Oliver (above me with a "3" rating, last time I looked): "Designing a game so long and so complex without being particularly realistic is quite a feat."

Question: What do you do when you need to sell your products in order to make a living but have only one product to sell?

Answer: You keep adding poorly tested expansions that make the game more complicated  and eventually you try and get people to by it all over again in a new edtion. The ultimate example of reverse development. 

A great game with the third edtion rules is now a tedious monstrosity.

To paraphrase Chief Joseph: I will flame no more forever!

I would call it the definitive for global WWII strategic wargames.  Why so damn man editions though?  I still have the 4th. Edition and I prefer it over the later ones.  Any game that allows you to play China has to be amazing and this damn thing has it all!  Lots of expansions available and most of them are too cool.  In the end, I think you could fight the war anyplace on the planet.  Huge time factor though. Good luck finding dedicated players and you need a room to set it up in and leave it there.  If you haven't experienced this game, you should at least find a group that plays and do it!

Played one full worldwide campaign as the sowjets. Axis went successfully for the mediterranean und shut the western allies effectively out of Europe and the med (only one very unsuccessful landing in 1944 in Denmark). I was unable to declare war in 1941 (what surprise). Very effective defense of the motherland with virtually no loss of territory against the german army in 1942 when they tried a late Barbarossa. Germans were out of Russia again in Mid 1944, but there was no foray into eastern Europe save a paradrop into an foolishly (Finally a mistake by the Axis player!) unguarded Bucarest, which at least got Rumania out of the war. Evolved into a two front war when Japan did'nt check the garrisons on the Manchurian border in 1944, and the Sovjets could declare war on them. China became the manoeuvre-battlefield for my reds where this was'nt possible in Europe - the last turn saw sowjet troops enter Hongkong and liberate China, after Manchuria and Korea before.
But because of the lack of progress in Europe and the blunders of the western allies, the Axis won a clear victory overall.
It was quite an experience!

For me, World in Flames is the game agaisnt which others must be compared.

I think the reason I like it so much is that it is a great strategy game for WWII and it includes a lot of detail; but I don't think it ever gets overwhelming.  The reason it doesn't is because each 'part' is a regular sized game; the War in the USSR is a 150 piece game; the Battle of the Atlantic, the strategic bombing campaign, the War in the Pacific - each is manageable game.

The strategic element brings these all together. World in Flames can be played in many different ways, with lots of ability to expand and many optional rules.    There are lots of scenarios to try.  

It handles all of its aspects well and does integrate all of the 'games within the game'.  

Finally, there is a fairly large and active community which is available for help, rules questions, strategy hints, etc.

For me the benchmark of games simulating the whole war. Top notch components but the systems ( when playing with the relevant sub-modules ) are just about the best I have seen. Excellent naval, air and land combat systems amongst others. The way individual flavored units and detail is incorporated is brilliantly done without creating additional complexity.Overall the game is quite intuitive, flows elegantly and not that complicated for what it attempts to do.

Kids' Collection
4th/5th edition

Starting to play it with my 8 year old son.  He's reading the rules and does not seem to be overwhelmed by them so this should be an interesting time, but for gaming, I am now completely turned off games that cannot settle down with their rules.  It seems that this is yet another game torn between those who want to make it playable vs those who want to make it realistic.  I will probably play it, but I have a feeling that it will be tough to find someone who is a WiF 5th edition Luddite...
Moved to the backburner with the addition of Europe Engulfed to their collection.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
While I likely prefer A3R more (rated it higher than WiF), I do consider WiF to be a more complete experience and a more detailed one.
Sadly my 4th edition set with a few add ons likely will never go past being a shelf ornament. It's the size to set up thing.
It's why I recently bought the computer release in 2013.

This was my "favorite game" for years, in the years when I had the most time and energy to think about 'big' games.  I studied it extensively and actually played it about 4 times, but could never get a group together, despite various attempts at selling the idea.  I have 3rd and 4th edition, and a few bits of add-ons.  I still admire the maps and the spiral production system.  Can't imagine ever trying to play this again, unless I have NOTHING else at all to do for months on end, and when will that ever happen?  I finally have the table to play it on, but where would we eat?  I'd probably get Europe Engulfed or similar instead.  However the PC version may be in the cards, similar to the PC version of Empire in Arms.  Long games should all be played PBEM, in my opinion.

After Britannia and History of the World, World in Flames happened to be my third wargame purchase as a young teen. Fond memories. Hope to one day get back into this monster...

Back then it was my favourite game. Bar none. I'm sure I'd get a roaring good time out of it these days as well, but I do have to say that the odds-based CRTs used by the game appear to me less than satisfactory now that I've experienced other combat resolution methods.

This rating is based on the Classic version of WiF.  What this game does best of the WW2 grand strategy games I've played is force players to make tough decisions on limited information.

I like this game but 6 hours of setting up one weekend does put you off a bit.  We may not have been very efficient but it still took longer to set up than we able to play the game.

This may be heresy but I can only see myself breaking out this game to admire the counters and map if a computer moderated version is created.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

Despite a few flaws in the naval system the 5th ed has stood the test of time. The final edition is an unplayable mess, but with some great ideas here and there. Immense fun and highly absorbing, it captures the interaction between land/air/naval units better than any other grand strategy WWII game. Don't be put off by whining eurogamers saying it's complicated - the mechanics are clean, elegant, and fast running. It takes a long time because it's WWII in all it's glory, but it's time well spent.

I was a play-tester on the first edition. I am not satisfied with the direction the game has taken.

From my point of view a very accurate and precise WWII boardgame. Perfect for people who want maximum detail. This comes at a price though. I found the game very difficult to play. Setup takes very long, even for the most basic scenario. You need lots of space for all the maps. Actual play is sluggish and takes days or even weeks if playing for the first time. Not recommended if you want a game that takes an evening or a day to complete.

RATING: 10
THE GAME on world war 2. Merges Strategic level decisions with operational level actions: GREAT!

Naval and air operations are superlative! 

The level of depth and personal involvment is incredible.

The rules, quite complex indeed, are very well written and have no bugs, thanks to years of playtesting and gameplays.

A limit of the game is the lack of scenarios (I would like to have more 2 player scenarios) even because in order to fully enjoy the beatiful whole war 4 maps scenario (39-45 or 41-45) you have to be in 4 or, better, 5 players.

Maybe it is also better to clarify that another limit for some players could be the fact that you need a lot of space to left the game (a whole room for 4 maps scenarios) because you cannot finish a game in only one session.

After playng WIF is hard to play other strategic level games on world war 2.

RATING: 7
Good WW2 grand strategy game. The main problem with the game is, as many others have commented, playing time.  However, single map games move rather quickly, especially the Pacific map, which can be played in a day if you play the 1941-1945 scenario.  The rules are definitely not for the faint of heart, but they're sound, at least in the 5th edition.  The production spiral is neat, and forces you to make some long term decisions about what your overall strategy will be.

The game is not without issues. For all its complexity and attempt at simulation value, too many games have boiled down to critical die rolls at crucial times. I've seen German advances halted by bad die rolling at Lille and Operation Barbarossa won or lost by continuation rolls in 1941 and 1942. The lack of attrition means you can get a sort of "all or nothing" effect depending on how streaky your die rolling is, too.

The final edition, however, feels suspiciously untested.  For every step forward (better map, better sub warfare rules), they took one step back (integrated HQ's, bizarrely complicated US entry rules).

Grand scope of WWII! Ships, planes, multiple land units maps for the whole world. However the constant "Final, final, final edition" feature creep is really annoying. Any game will require a full days preparation to decide which options are in and which are out. I also find some the mechanics a let down. Considering the game gives you control over training individual groups of pilots (and other extreme detail), a breakthrough mechanism and more rigorous supply system is needed to create more fluid campaigns. Its also hard to accurately model the European & Pacific scales properly (differently scaled maps is one step, but how to deal with unit scale?). Might break out a simple 5th Edition game again sometime.

Rating applies to 5th edition plus expansions released up through Ships in Flames.  The "Final Edition" of WiF ruined the game entirely.  Still can't understand how a designer could produce something like WiF5+ and then turn around and release something as awful as WiFFE.

A monster game of the World War II. 

Update: I've come to think the game is too luck dependent, the latest updates make the game more and more cumbersome and the end of turn mechanics are silly and completely unrealistic.

Well well well. How can I describe this?
Good points:
I've only really played this once (Barbarossa) and enjoyed it. 
Bad points:
I did not, however, enjoy trying to learn the naval rules. It just seemed far too complicated.
Also the setup takes far too long and this is a major problem when you have only a weekend to try to play it. 
With more plays the rating may change, but I really can't rate it any higher at the moment.

I have played 5th and final editions through several times.  I love the final edition components; however, when using the FE rules, the options and expansion kits should be selected with care to avoid unnecessary clutter.  I am a fan of PiF and the pilots rule, CVPiF, oil rules, and HQ support.  SiF inflates navies out of all proportion, but its more nuanced convoy count does help a bit with supply lines.  The rest of the expansions are of questionable value - for example, should I really have artillery units at corps scale?  Once you have settled on the component set and desired complexity level, though, nothing I have yet seen quite matches the scope of WiF.  Definitely a good gaming experience.
2015 EDIT: Getting back into this heavily again, now under the RAW7 rules, which are an improvement but are forcing me to reboot my understanding of some subsystems.  Still great!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pretty good system, but IMHO eclipsed by GMT's A World At War.  Expansion kits brought some OUTSTANDING counter designs, but frankly a good thing's been taken WAY too far.  The different expansions make it difficult to keep track of what's new, discontinued and still current.  Best when played with it's half-sister "Days of Decision".  This game is ideal for some computer-assist; and in fact a computer version was started in 1998, and STILL is in development 10 years later.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
World in Flames is the end-all be-all WW2 strategy game.

Single map games can be quite reasonable to play, esp. the Pacific map.  The full game is certainly a monster, but well worth the trip.

I have owned several different versions, along with many expansions.  While the 5th edition did some things better (ahem, US Entry), overall I would still take the Final Edition over past versions.  I have also owned several expansions (Planes in Flames, Africa in Flames, Asia in Flames, etc.) and I can say that all of these lengthened the game for not much benefit, and several of them broke the game at various points.  The best way to play is to leave the expansions behind.

rated 9 instead of 10 due to play time.  the definition of monster game (and monster space required).

What can you say.  It's been around for ages (remember the first edition with generic ships and planes?) and its forced me to spend countless dollars on updates and kits. It has too great a level of detail for a game with two month turns.  Its designed for gamers (which I am not) rather than simulators (which I am), you have to search in a myriad of places to get rules and rules that improve play over the RAW; its a pain in the butt to sort after playing....and yet,  I keep coming back to it every so often and buying the new stuff.  Hey! Its a classic.

The final edition of WiR has it all. This is the best game in the genre of hard-core-war-games. However, it takes 50-200 hours to play the game (and I have no one to play with).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Far too complicated for its own good, and frequently rewards strategies that don't make much sense historically! But the ranking system asks me to consider my willingness to replay the game, and I never seem to get tired of marching my armies across the oversized map. Any game that renders every ship and aircraft type in WW2 at this level of detail has earned my approval. Arguing about why various rules or strategies are "broken" feels like just another aspect of the game itself, which functions as a conversation piece that encourages deeper reading in military and political history.

RATING: 8
The original (well version 3.0 thru 5.0) version(s) of WiF stole a lot of my life. I have played the game at least 30 times all the way throught and used to think nothing of taking a week off work to play a game.

Things change, many I have changed but I just can't get as excited about the final edition. We have done some work on de glossing WiF to get back to it roots but so far have not been able to finish the project.

I am sure I will play again but at present I think my addiction is cured.

Excellent strategic level simulation of World War II. Beautiful maps and counters. Expansions allow you to add the "chrome" you like at your own pace. You must be able to set it up and leave it between gaming sessions. It will take a massive amount of time to play, but it is very fun and worth the effort. Plays best with a group of at least 4 people, preferably 5.

  I like the ships, I -love- the planes, I love the production spiral...I don't care much for the ground unit play.   The ground units need a morale factor that could note that while a strike from a 1940 British carrier might disrupt a colonial native levy, it is NOT going to do the same to a Panzer corps.   In general, the ground game is blah compared to the battles going on the high seas and in the air.  Weather is -highly- overrated as a factor.   Might be redeemable yet.  Ideally it should be a comprehensive three-cornered game between Communism, Fascism and Democracy struggling for world domination from 1936 to 1953, with almost an endless number of permutations.   In actual play, the gamers will wind up arguing over some rule until the game disbands   Would give it a 8.0, but it loses another .5 points for perpetrating the Great Gibraltar Myth (my W.W. II simulation pet peave), although not as badly as Third Reich.

RATING: 7
Prewar and WWII game of politics and military affairs on a grand scale.  Some clever design offers players lots of options to try out different strategies.  I enjoy the flexibility; however, the yearly force pool additions do tend to script the game.  The early to middle war is my favourite part of the game with lots of tough strategic choices to be made.  This game can be very good at times and with a few exceptions has generally improved over the years.

Lack of manpower and supply/attrition rules may be the game’s biggest failing.  Unfortunately the game does little to model these very real and significant strategic challenges.  Land combat is just ok as it does not effectively model advances in technology and tactics/organization as a game covering the time and scope of the period rightfully should do.  Finally, the game would benefit from a clean-up and consolidation of the many expansions and rules options as well as some game changes/fixes (one need only note the size of the WIF message boards dealing with rules questions).  Nevertheless, I believe WiF Final Edition is probably the best WWII grand strategy game yet.  I continue to hope that ADG will refocus its efforts on a new edition to make a good game into a great game.

2k6: This really is a lifestyle game. For several of the people I game with it is the only wargame they will play. It does what it does very well, but is prone to blowout game endings (mainly in Russia) and it takes forever to play -- two games finished, with one ended in 1940, and one ongoing (1943) in five years!
 
We play this 1-3 times a month in the Uppsala in Flames gaming group -- Henrik has generously dedicated a room to us in his basement. Kudos to him!

I played this game with my friends who own virtually the complete "-in flame" series.  Never get into the series with the system or the cartoon map and counters very much myself (well, they were made in Australia....) My friends, on the contrary, enjoy the series very much and think they are realistic.  The Final Deluxe Edition, at least, has a sort of collector value.  A real monster game not for the faint-of-heart.  Well, I prefer to stick to my copies of Third Reich, Advanced Third Reich and The Rising Sun. (A note: the final deluxe edition is impressive enough to prompt me into this...slowly).

I like monster games. I like the "big picture". And yet I can't quite like WiF. First, the rules are a complete disaster, even before you add several mismatched options. Second, there can be events way off base --- come on, the Imperial Japanese Navy conquers Gibraltar? (I've seen it happen). But several of my friends like it, so down the rabbit hole I go.

Best WW2 game ever.  Naval rules need improvement, but they are meant to be abstract.  The last version of this game fixed much of that, but added several layers of complexity.  Almost too complex, hence the non-perfect score.

This would be a 9 if it was easy to find players, space and time. I like it. If you have opponents who knows the rules you can push it and maybe play two turns a night. The map is so ugly your eyes bleed! Nice counters and charts though.

I've never found a game that so deeply involves you with every aspect of the strategic level of the WW2.

For me, the best simulating IIWW.

RATING: 3
Unending modifications with obviously no clear picture of what actually the goal is that is supposed to be simulated.  This looked like a wargame from heaven when I first found it.  The absurdity of the naval system in the Pacific was particularly painful.  Left after the switch to 5th edition and have not looked back.

Good game. But it's for fans of planning and construction.

When it comes to strategic level wargames, this is it.

Probably its biggest flaw is the lack of a real political system.  The CW invading PT in 1939 has very minimal political impact.  Same thing with dropping a series of A-bombs on a country.

Comment based on the few years played in early 90s with this with friends in Melbourne. Back then it was very deep and the mechanics were elegant. And it gave a superb run through of strategic decisions (what to build, what to invade) with the tactics of how. Classic gamer overkill- run the war and fight the batle. Game was marred by the constant need to double check what edition rule was in effect (with gamers who'd been playing it longer and who had more to unlearn).

Now have Final edition and when I get a chance will adjust marks as needed.

Fully completed only twice... what a game.. probably the most complex and complete game at strategic level I played on WWII. Bluto Blutarsky's quote (was it over when German bombed Pearl harbor?) isn't that unreal: as Axis player, I managed to go west (sea lion) instead of east (Barbarossa). And I could also take North Africa, going to get Iraq for its oil resources.
lot of fun, lot of hard time to manage all fronts. both games have taken about six month each, playing regulary five to seven full days month.
The pacific and africa expansions are a must.

I don't know what to say about this game. The first time ever I encountered it was at a game session together with four guys forming a punk group in southern Sweden, where the lead singer creamed the drummist when he wanted to add ice to the Glenfiddich whiskey being served... 
Anyway, the absolute beauty of the game itself is the counters that have been introduced during the last years. Some years after "the Glenfiddich Incident" I bought the game, version number 5. After this the game has evolved, with further expansions and revisions. As I liked the counters I bought Planes In Flames together with Ships In Flames. At the same time I got some new rules for how to do things. And when I recently bought the additions "Convoys in Flames" and Cruisers in Flames" I got some more of them. Right now I have three different rules how things work out, which adds to the confusion of the game. But I can't complain, and why is this? Simply, I apply the rules that suit the best, and still I have all those beautiful counters around. What I like best with this game is that anything, and I mean anything, can happen. It's only in World In Flames where the French cruiser Algerie sinks itself in defiance outside Bingerville, Africa, because it fears to have to surrender to the German forces in western Africa.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Played a lot to this edition and 4th edition.  Too much options, which affect balance.  The game favors Axis.  I do not like the way USSR is handled, too many times soviet player get thrashed and must retreat to the Urals to survive.  The problem of different scales between Europe and Asia maps.

The Vichy rules which i find not realistic.  Metropolitan Vichy does not really surrenders and can stays a thorn in allies to almost the end of the campaign.

The naval system with surprise points and map boxes, which can completely alter a naval or naval/air combat, i dislike.

Un gros wargame de la catégorie des Monsters Games.
Il permet de revivre l'intégralité de la deuxième guerre mondiale en 100 heures ou plus. le jeu est donc consommateur de temps et d'espace et demande une solide implication, mais le plaisir est au rendez-vous!
Les règles sont massives mais sont bien rédigées, le matériel est quant à lui de bonne qualité.

L'intérêt du jeu vient surtout du système de production qui permet à chaque joueur de planifier les unités qu'il compte mettre en jeu d'ici un à 20 tours, suivant que vous produisiez des divisions ou un porte-avions.

A big wargame of the Monsters category Games.
It can relive the entire second world war in 100 hours or more. The game is time consuming and space and requires a firm commitment, but the pleasure is you!
The rules are massive but well written.

The interest of the game comes mostly from the production system that allows each player to plan units he intends to play the next one to 20 rounds, depending on whether you produce divisions or an aircraft carrier.

The WWII game that gives you access to the whole world, as well comprehensively addressing most of the strategic dilemmas you would ever want in a game of this genre. The major downsides of the game are the evergrowing rules and the requirement of being either 1) incredibly disciplined or 2) independently wealthy in order to actually complete a game. The computer game may alleviate these problems.

RATING: 8
World in Flames: Final Edition is still one of my favorite games. It does take about 1.5 zillion years to play, but I find it worth it. Although it is complex, it does make sense (at least after a couple of plays). The latest edition components are very good, especially the maps. I would add that the most exciting portion of the game is from 1940/1 to 1943. Before then, not enough countries are involved, and when naval production dies down in late 1943, the game gets less interesting. But, during that period it is very engaging. Perhaps a variable end-time would add something to keeping naval production going after 1943--not that the game needs to be any longer, but something to keep the interest up.

Overview:
*The* WW2 game. I've magnetized my WIF game so that I can mount it on the walls. That little project cost me around 300 euro. For ten years running it was always up and there was constantly a game in progress, so the money was well spent. After moving I haven't mounted it again since I don't have a playing partner, but man, how I love this game. The scope of it amazes me. Hope I will find the opportunity in the future to start playing again.

Quick review:
You have to understand that WIF is for addicts only. It's a monster game. Playing time is 100-150 *hours* (yes folks, that's 6000-9000 minutes) for the full game, there are over 1000 counters, the rules are 100 pages long and the freaking game fills an entire room by itself for years on end. If you have commitment issues, WIF is not for you. If you can make the commitment however, you will be greatly rewarded.

WIF is theme-driven: it attempts to simulate WW2. It is open-ended and re-balanced to play better as a game, but still the rules and playing pieces are designed from the theme. This is appealing to gamers with an interest in history. Most of the playing pieces represent forces that actually took part in WW2, while some pieces represent forces that concievably could have taken part (to facilitate "what-if" strategies).

At heart, WIF is a game of conflict, setting Axis against Allies. You are aiming to defeat your adversary in detail, to destroy his armies and conquer his lands. But if you have more players than two, it's also a game of co-operation, as players on the same side have the same objectives. And in tournament play, it's even a game of competition: you need to take those objectives before your so called allies do.

The complexity is... well, staggering. Even after years of play, you will still play some rules wrong. Accept this and be prepared to make frequent returns to the rule book.

The scope of WIF is strategic. It's not about a single battle, but rather about logistics: bringing your forces to bear faster and harder than your opponent can respond. And it really is grand strategy. For example, building (an important aspect of the game) a new aircraft carrier takes 12 turns. The game is 36 turns long. 12 turns equals two years of in-game time and about 40 hours of game time. So when you give the order to start building an aircraft carrier, you expect it to come into action two years (or 40 hours) later. Learn not to cry when it gets sunk in its first naval combat, and understand that you have to pre-plan (in a broad sense) the operations that you want that unit to take part in 40 hours before you actually get to use it. This is a large part of what makes WIF so fantastic. No other game comes close to this scope of strategic decision-making.

The tactical decision-making in WIF is probabilistic: it's about knowing when to play it safe and when to risk it all on the roll of the dice. Randomness of dice is not a big issue in WIF because of the scale: you're going to roll hundreds of dice over the course of the game and that virtually ensures that they will be fairly evenly distributed. There's always critical luck on especially important rolls to contend with, but who can say that luck doesn't play its part in real warfare anyway? Learn to roll with the punches and the game becomes less frustrating.

There is a built-in balancing mechanism in the rules: the Allies get relatively stronger over time. All players will thus get to have their happy time. But understand that the Axis will get their happy time first. The Allies will get their happy time 60 hours later. This places a requirement on the Axis player not to become disheartened and concede the game after 65 hours. If you're in, you're in until the bitter end, fighting tooth-and-nail against overwhelming power to salvage Berlin from the Soviet clutches. Did I mention how this game is about commitment?

Be careful with mixing players of different skill levels. If you are a group of players and want to take in a new player, he or she has to understand what they are getting into. For the first game that person should play one of the less important powers and get frequent help from his or her allies. An "in-character" mind-set can also help the less skilled players to accept their position: in the real WW2, France was f.ex. "played" very poorly from a WIF perspective. Different skill levels are a part of warfare too.

Replayability is limitless thanks to the myriad of strategic options. How many times can you play a 100 hour game anyway? There are also tons of optional rules that can be used to vary each game. This practice encourages the creation of house rules to further tailor the game to your tastes. Just be careful not to disturb any core rules when doing so, the rules are intrically linked and a change in one end can end up unraveling something unexpected in the other end.

RATING: 7.5
Great game that you need to play with someone who knows the rules.  Managing the supply lines as Great Britain was the one thing that killed the game for me; if that rule set was simplified, the game would be outstanding.  All the rest was complex but understandable and sensible.

RATING: 7
I like a lot of things about this game.  The design of the components (maps and counters) just appeals to me for some reason.  Some of the systems in the game are very clever, although I do still find some things a bit confusing.  Overall I think it is a playable monster, but it does take quite a long time (obviously).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Much better than Third Reich (Third edition). Though it takes longer to play. Dig it out and play a solo game every few years but only use the basic set as I can't be doing with all the fiddly add ons. WIF 5 had the best Battle of the Atlantic system I've seen, got dropped in later editions much to their detriment. Played several two player games years ago before my opponent departed for foreign climes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very good game with almost limitless strategic options, which makes most games radically different.  All of the updates have made improvements on the game, but also almost impossible to keep up with the rules.  A great game if you have the time to invest.  I really like the indefinite turn length.

Note my experience has been primarily with the 5th Release of he game (prior to the "Final Edition").

Recreates the dilemmas of the different powers in WWII while also managing to allow a multitude of stratetic options; you're never straightjacketed into following the course of history.  

If only it didn't take weeks to complete a single game... we used to call this one 'Life in Flames' because of the investment it required to the detriment of other areas of your life (like relationships, study, or gainful employment).

My group deliberately didn't update to some of the later additions, simply because the level of detail started to get a bit too specific.

The best game of WWII I have ever encountered. Combines strategic planning ahead and production, world-wide strategy and local-theatre tactics in one. Lots of extra stuff and additional rules/units etc.
Does take a long time to play, and takes up significant amount of space, though. But a truly excellent game!

Most impressive, but under normal circumstances simplay unplayable. Definitely not suitable for wargame newbies. Still, I am very interested in this game. Computerized version is currently being developed (http://www.matrixgames.com/products/296/details/World.In.Flames), I will probably get this one after it'll be released instead of 6 square meters of maps and 1400 counters.

Has some hard to grasp rules, though they are not as complex as they might seem at first glance. 
I read the rules 8-10 times and then finally they seemed to make sense. 

Highly customizable rendition of WW2, best strategic game of the period that I have come across. 

My rating is based on the game AFTER we have made our own changes to the game system, the air & naval system in particular needed some changes. If I had not made these changes, my rating would be a 7.

Gets a high recommendation from me, given that you have the time and space available required to play this monster.

My rating might go down slightly as I get to play more, but I doubt it will.

The 4th edition (the one before Final Edition) is probably the best edition I have played. Without all of the expansions, it is actually reasonable in terms of time commitment and rules overhead. With each expansion, it became less about strategy and more about who could remember what obscure rule. Sadly, the naval rules have never worked in this system. That said, just about anything you can imagine doing as a leader of a combatant during WWII, you can do in this game. IMHO, it is still the best strategic-level WWII game out there.

Great integration of navy, air and land plus diplomacy and production into this one.

I would love to pbem or even better, get a game going in the Chicago area.

Best strategic game of the WW2 ever. However since they add rules and rules, and rules again... the reality is that we play a startegic game with tokens and rules of a tactic one... For me is loosing the punch... and I love complex game... probably I am in a different stage of my life with wife and kids...

Fantastic game, playing solo and loving it. If you're nr cardiff and fancy a game give me a shout :))
Awesomeness squared! Works well as a PBEM game (i'm using Vassal) which means you don't need a spare room to have it set up in.
It is a monster game, and about the journey as much as the victory, but hey losing always hurts!

A super monster game, almost unplayable F2F due to the time and energy needed. Tried it a few times but after 50  hours over many weeks the dust starts to make a play for world domination :)

I love the game mechanics and the production spiral. Excellent mix of wargaming, campaign planning, economy balancing and even some diplomacy if you find enough WIF geeks to play it as a multi-player. Only playable as PBEM.

3rd to 5th edition are fun to play...you need some houserules...for instance there is the danger that the US enters the war much too early...do not play it with the optional set planes in flames, Africa aflames etc. even though they look very nice they are completely unnecassary and make the game unbalanced and sometimes very strange!!!
That is also the reason why I have never bought the "final" edition....100 optional rules...xhjgsdhlkf...arrrggghhh

Certainly the best game to get a true strategic sense of the conflict. Excellent interaction between production decision, logistics and operational execution.

Many of the bad ratings refer to older editions of the game (often with a "I liked edition 5 but never had the strength to move on to the update" twist). One would today start with the 1996 "final" version, which has been by and large stable. Some also complain about the number of optional rules: just remember that WiFFE is still a great game should you play "vanilla", ie without any option.

One small improvement area: designer seems to take long leaves and support / reply to question sometimes takes ages. AG finally put together a FAQ in 2009 (13 years after WiFFE first printing...), updates of which are intermittent at best.

I have only played one partial game of World in Flames. The game is beautifully designed. The counters and map are unmatched in color and detail. The game itself seems very intriguing. 

The major flaws are the fact that the game needs multiple players who need to commit large blocks of time. Some players may spend an entire sitting with very little to do. The rules are complex and poorly written. Still given the time and a group of dedicated players, I would be willing to play this again.

RATING: 6
We played this one into the ground & still never managed to get all the rules right. It's tremendously popular but something about it always seemed a bit plastic to me - the system is very gamey but its not a million miles away from Victory Games' Civil War which I love, the difference between the two is that, to me, the latter actually produces results that resemble its subject whereas WIF is merely a clever game that could be about shopping trolleys. The naval section of the game is a bit of a joke. Doesn't mean its not fun though.

The most impressive game I've ever seen. Have played the entire war 2 times and put lots and lots of time into it. Probably I will never play it again. It takes too much time. And since there are so many advantages to gain by thinking and playing carefully, it's not fun to play it quickly.

RATING: 7
If you like WWII grand-Strategic wargames, you cannot avoid WiF. The mechanics are very good and the strategic feel undeniable, BUT the length is just too much: it can take more than a year to play, and that's with weekly sessions! I've only played with the Final Edition (WiFFE), and it's actually a great thrill to play, but finishing a game is a goal worthy of appearing in your resume if you ever achieve it. Try it with as few expansions as possible.

Played the full campaign a couple of times back in the day (including Days of Decision).  A lot of quirky mechanics, including "flipping", white-print units, the whole naval system, etc.  The overall package works reasonably well, as well as any huge WW2 in Europe game can be expected to work.  Eclipsed by Krieg! in my mind, but still cool stuff going on.  Planes in Flames is a must, the rest of the expansions are unnecessary.

WIF rules can be a bit of a mind bender, but they do work.  Best to get an experienced player to explain the game, or play with an experienced group of players - you&#039;ll get plenty of strategy advise from other players on your side (allied or axis).  I have found this game to be very addictive for 30 years and counting.  Biggest drawback is the amount of time/space required (4x8 table, 80-120 hours).  Try the expansions if you want, but I&#039;ve never found them to be truly worth it. Playing Matrix Games' Computer WiF has forced me to get accustomed to Ships in Flames and Planes in Flames, but I think the game works fine without them.

The ultimate WWII grand strategic game.  It covers the whole war in both theatres, has integrated ground, air, and naval rules, and one of the most realistic production systems.  Yeah you need 4-5 players, a ping-pong table or bigger, and a serious time commitment, but it's worth it.

One of my goals in life is to play this game before I die. I've done bits and shards but never had space or time to set the whole thing up. Beautifully produced strategic WWII game of the entire war at a corps/army level. I own all of the "...in Flames" supplements and feel that they nearly all improve the game, or at least improve the look - which to me amounts to almost the same thing. Truly is playable solo, if you adjust your thinking a bit - I always win the rules arguments.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The final (well almost) edition of the ADGs enduring classic. WWII in it's entirety at the corps/army level. State of the art components, great looking counters and maps. Incorporates most of the "...in Flames" supplements and puts it all in one rule book - a little easier to digest in this fashion. The rules are complex, but they can be mastered, and you will be rewarded. Probably the best strategic WWII game of all time.

RATING: 8
A very different beast from A World at War, the other WW2 monster in my collection. Captures more detail (all those different planes...with bespoke artwork!), has some very nifty design solutions (impulses, sea boxes) but in the end falls short (in my opinion) essentially due to the unreasonable amount of luck implied by outcomes depending linearly on d10 rolls. If the combat ones may even out throughout the game, the ones shortening crucial turns and deciding weather eventually will not. This one is very much a game that plays the players. Including all the options seems a real mission too. For all its ahistoricities, I think AWAW/3rd Reich conveys the whole WW2 package in a more elegant and compact way.

Edit: still an elegant system and a grand experience. (rating up one mark).

We were on a break from WiF since my regular gaming partner lived in another city. Now it's life, having a full time job and a kid (update: 2 kids!)

I played this a lot. I mean a lot. Like all the time, constantly for years.
Can it be played any other way? 
A typical session was about 4 and a half hours long, and I count that as playing the game once. Many many times...

Finished 6 games of the full war and 9 fascist tide...I think.

A massive EPOS of a wargame. Unfortunately, ADG never seemed to figure out how to create a "definitive" version of the game.

I have the old 5ed and this was a fun game that played well but had a few quirks. All the german/italian subs in central atlantic could almost stop the allies from getting reinforcements in the late game (43-45) to Europe. I also have the "final" edition from 2000. But all the other packages in the magazines is just to much for me to bother following. But, its still a fun game. It just a bit more to keep track of.

Have the 3rd and 5th editions and those were OK. Have the Final Edition and if it really had been the Final Edition, it probably would have been OK too (except for the diety-awful maps!). 

But since the Final Edition was merely a smoke screen leading into ten expansions adding more to the Final Edition, which is already top-heavy enough, I passed.

I kept the 5th editionand am looking forward to someone's eventual clean-up of these rules. My rating is for the 5th edition only.

RATING: 3
Not a game but a way of life. Used to play it a lot, but as the editions and supplements began to stack up, and my table space dwindled, I moved on to other things. I remember the amount of "bobbing and weaving" of individual planes in what is supposed to be a strategic game was a real chore. Game system is weakened by a load of weird features (e.g. random unit construction, so that the Brits absolutely must build the British paratrooper as early as possible in case Britain is invaded, because the next infantry unit you try to build for Britain may end up randomly being the New Zealand infantry which deploys in New Zealand!) The fact that you have a whole A4 page checklist of which optional rules you intend to use is dispiriting.

Unusable and trashed after water/mold damage while boxed and in storage in the garage.

This was one of my favorites.  I think I had the 2nd edition.  I remember some great evenings with 4 guys playing this one.  Might have to replace this.  I also know that Matrix has been developing this as a computer game for several years...progressing like a glacier.  

Update:  Replaced!  Bought the 5th edition on ebay because I've read that the Final Edition is more complex, and that just doesn't work for me.  Still, this is a monster game - what is it about monster games that draws me in, and earns my admiration but little ability to really invest in the game to learn it and turn it into real playing time?  Sigh...maybe some day...  

And...the computer version from Matrix is STILL in development as of mid 2013 with no release date in sight.  [Edit - it came out in 2015 I guess.  I bought it, but just can't get into it. Again it's the 6th (final) edition, and it's just too big.]

I tried very hard to enjoy this game but couldn't. Maybe because I didn't have all the expansions.IMO this game needs Days of Decision to probably compliment the political aspects (didn't play with DOD). I think you need to be aggressive in this game or else it will be slow. Rating based on size, scope and components. It would have easily been in the 7-7.5 range if it was more enjoyable.
I did enjoy the expansion (Fatal Alliances) though.

Great game, complex and long but that is necessary to accuratly cover the war.  The only problem is getting players who want to commit the the time to play the game (and read the rules)

Midgets, midgets. Far too many expansions that no one can resist. A candy store in one heavy box.

i cannot support a game that claims to have a final edition, yet has in the works a version beyond the final edition, also there is a huge bloat of dlc

Veeeery long. Played it once 72 hrs. We were halfway through WW-II when we quit! Love the productionsystem! The good news is: Matrix Games is producing an PBeM PC-game

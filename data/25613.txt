Big time thumbs down.  Making hundreds of little moves to eek out the slightest incremental advantages is a drag. Where's the action? Where're the big plays? The excitement? The interaction? THE FUN?!?

Scales well enough to upgrade it a tiny bit. Three- and four- player games much more interesting than two-player. From 7.9 to 8.0.

RATING: 10
Rating after only three plays (one beginner level, two intermediate). This was so worth the wait...and the money! I want to play it all the time and can't wait to try the full game because it always seems too short. Definitely my hot game of the moment.

Update: After 5 plays upgraded to a 10. It's frustrating and awesome and may just be my favourite game ever.

Anyone familiar with Sid Meier's civilisation computer game will recognise some of the concepts in here. (It even has a card named after Sid). very well executed it is too. Maybe a little too long for what it is to rate it as a true classic but I'm just scratching the surface with it at the moment and it certainly has the potential to get to that level.

Incredible game, best with 4, but too fiddly for desktop playing, which is how a game should be played.  Best, unfortunately, online, but what an incredible game!  If the fiddliness and complexity of the rules were not in question, then this would be a 10.

Civilization in a box. It doesn't have a map, but it has everything else. I really feel like I'm running a nation and advancing eras. Every time you pay you get different choices that steer your game in different directions. This is tied for my favorite game of all time, but that could change after I play the new one. :)

A complex and lengthy game of resource management and civ building.  There are a lot of things to keep balanced in this one, and falling behind on any one track or resource can really kill you.  The order that the cards come out can really put you in a bind if you are out of position to get an upgrade you really need.

130929  Yeah its just too long.  I don't think I will ever play this again.  Pax has everything I want in a game of this type.  And its more thematic to boot.  I just hate the fact that you need to know the deck to play TTR well.

121231 I learned this one day and then Pax Porfiana the next.  I wasn't really that taken with TTA anyways, but Pax just killed it.  I see why TTA is regarded so highly, its a very nice design (albeit physically slightly fiddly).  But not a game I enjoy playing.  If/when I procure a copy of Pax I'd most likely drop this game to a 2 rating.

Aside from personal preference critique, I have to say that I do not like the enclosed playing space of TTA.  All the age cards show up and that creates a closed ecosystem which makes for predictable game playing for those who enjoying honing their skill.  However, I much prefer the partial deck usage of Pax.  It creates an open game history which feels truly thematic.

That said, it is a nice implementation of Sid Meier's Civilization without a map.  I can't imagine that the actually branded Sid Meier Civilization is nearly this good (only read the rules to that game)

I feel like I should like it, as I LOVE Civilization games, but I just don't. It didn't click with me for some reason. Everything felt too abstract and fiddly and I couldn't visualise what my civilization was actually like. It was like fiddling around with a spreadsheet of numbers.

RATING: 6
Would like to try.. Love the Civ-like theme, but the game seems very fiddly and really ugly, so I'm not too excited..

***

Took me ages before I finally got to try this one.. It also took us ages (4 hours) to finish our 3-player game.

My first impression is really torn. I love Civ and this does give me some of that good old Civ-feeling. At the same time it gives me a lot of the micromanagement and tedious bookkeeping I really don't care for. The mechanics are pretty ingenious, but overall the fiddliness bothers me. I understand the elegant abstraction of the design, but I do miss a map.. When I think of a Civilization game, I'm thinking of something beefier than a glorified card game. I also have a problem with the butt-ugly art and graphic design. The main thing - the progress through the ages - flows quite beautifully, though.. although it does take it's time!

So.. I love parts of it, but for my taste it's too ugly, too fiddly and plain too long, and I don't see myself playing it very often.. This knocks points off the design, that is otherwise pretty impressive. I'll settle for a 7. Also, it's definitely too pricey for what you get.

RATING: 7
An interesting and sweeping epic game without the epic gameplay time (some might disagree with that). Each game tells a story, the game mechanics are interesting and keep things moving at a brisk pace, and the decisions that are balanced against each other are difficult and challenging. I've enjoyed every playing of this, win or lose... even when misinterpreting rules.

Speaking of rules, my one criticism of this game is the manner in which the rules are presented. Finding answers to questions that arise during the game is quite difficult due to not knowing the section of the rules (basic, intermediate, or advanced rules) to peruse. It's very frustrating.

The best civilisation board game I am yet to play and just incredible. A long but very rewarding and clever game. Each decision really matters and due to the way the card selection and event cards work - each game should be different. Classic. Need to play more!

RATING: 7
Normally you have boardgames with supporting card usage, and this game works the other way around. Many Cards and an oversized board which is just used as a scoretrack. The core mechanics are quite similar to Origins - How we became humans, where each wood marker can be used for different purposes. It is shorter than other civilization-games but it also lacks the epic feeling of other games which take up to 12h.

Lowered to a 9.5.  Love this game, but rarely get it to the table due to length.  

Lowered again to an 8.  I'm not drawn to this as much anymore.  It its heart it's a very long engine building game with multiple end game scoring combinations.  I love what it's trying to do more than the actual game itself.

I've played a basic game and the middle game... this one is wonderful! The multitude of cards allows for lots of customization of your civilization, and I really feel like you can create an empire with a unique feel and style of play. The game plays smoothly and keeps you engaged the entire time... you can tell that they put a lot of work into this one. I hope it gets reprinted soon!

Definitely need to play this one again in the Advanced game.  We only tried the beginner game and it took 3 hours because of slow players - not a great experience.  But it left me wanting more.  It was pretty fun for a civilization game and I wanted to play it again.  If the fun goes up with the options, and if the down time goes down, I'll like it more.

Update - played advanced game.  Fantastic game, tho still very long, even with only 3 players.  I have a bit of concern that the weakest player just gets continually beat down, but maybe that's just b/c our weakest player was not playing well.

After few more games I like it even more. However military deck is a bit too random.

2010-04-17 (rating 8.5):

A very interesting game. Differs much from the computer Civilization but is in no way a drawback for me. While playing one has to constantly decide what to do now, what to achieve next, how to adapt to what happens. And the resources of all kinds are always in shortage. Many ways to victory including the military one.

But I still haven't played it with more then 2 players. Lets hope I will have a chance to try.

Based solely on a few plays online during a weekend when I was sick.  I liked it a lot and hear that the new version corrects some of my minor concerns about the game, such as the luck of the draw with the military cards and how overpowered military can be.

I'd buy a copy of the new version if it would get to the table with some regularity, which doesn't seem likely.  I also wonder if this is too fiddly/annoying when played without a computer doing the upkeep for you.

Update: Played a couple more times online.  Great game that seems to be even better in the new version.

Tengo sentimientos muy opuestos de amor-odio con este juego xD
Tras ya varias partidas, por ahora me gusta pero me ha decepcionado bastante, ya que despu√©s de todo lo positivo que tiene, tiene algunas cartas muy desproporcionadas. Y que est√© tan desequilibrado a lo militar, no me gusta, sobretodo a 2 jugadores, donde la estrategia militar es casi la √∫nica a seguir (probarlo a 2 con la variante "pac√≠fica"), y tambi√©n cierto azar que tiene el juego, interesante de base, pero exagerado como consecuencia de estas cartas desproporcionadas (OP)  sobretodo de guerras y algunos l√≠deres) lo transforman en un intento de gran juego sin llegar a conseguirlo 100%. Que salga ese l√≠der o guerra en el momento justo, y sobretodo, que te salga a t√≠ o al enemigo por puro azar, o una guerra que le quita al m√°s d√©bil tropecientosmil puntos, para d√°rselos a quien gana... etc, y cebarse siempre con el m√°s d√©bil, lo convierte en un juego dif√≠cil de digerir despu√©s de muchas horas de dura gesti√≥n. A parte de ser un juego muy abstracto, que no tengo problema con eso al respecto, pero en consecuencia tardas en pillarle el rollo al no ser en principio lo l√≥gico o intuitivo lo mejor.
Habr√° quien le guste, pero "currartelo" tanto, y durante varias horas en un juego muy muy largo,(yo lo estoy jugando casi exclusivamente online, por su duraci√≥n) para que al final esos detalles descompensados y azarosos decidan, pues a mi me decepciona mucho, sobretodo el azar de los eventos finales. Quiero probar otras variantes, sin guerras o pac√≠ficas a ver... Vlaada, que lo considero gran autor, y con juegos con grand√≠simas ideas, a mi me da la sensaci√≥n que no termina de redondear sus juegos, ni de equilibrarlos, y siempre acaban teniendo alg√∫n defecto importante... (El Dungeon Lords y Galaxy Trucker acabaron saliendo de mi ludoteca). Ser√° su estilo pero a mi no me termina de gustar, y me da la sensaci√≥n de muy poco testeo... aunque em realidad no sea as√≠.
Que rabia, con lo que podr√≠a haber sido este juego... Por el concepto, me parece un grand√≠simo juego en s√≠ (sin hablar de las ediciones ni componentes), pero por todo lo dicho, ni de lejos un rank 2 de la BGG... 

Otra cosa:
Tema vs. jugabilidad: Lo ideal es un equilibrio siempre en los juegos, pero si hay que disminuir uno para mejorar otro, opino que siempre se deber√≠a mejorar la jugabilidad, es un juego, no una novela.
Muchos justifican en este juego el desbalanceo militar, porque es como han dominado las civilizaciones siempre. Bueno, pues que casi no sepas escribir y que tengas un gran ej√©rcito del medievo que pueda arrasar tu civilizaci√≥n del siglo XX que dispone de misiles, tem√°tico no es la palabra! xD Que esto est√© justificado por la jugabilidad, estar√≠a bien, pero tampoco es el caso, ya que los puntos de cultura/victoria, no represantar√≠an para nada lo avanzada que est√° la civilizaci√≥n, y m√°s cuando de esta forma puedes intercambiar much√≠simos con una de las guerras. En fin que es muy abstracto y nada tem√°tico, para cumplir m√°s con la jugabilidad.


Descripci√≥n/opini√≥n inicial:
Si el juego de PC Civilization de Sid Meier estuviera hecho juego de cartas, ser√≠a muy similar a √©ste. Tiene 3 modos de juego: B√°sico, Avanzado y Completo. Cada uno m√°s completo y m√°s largo, que de por si el juego ya lo es, pero a quien le guste la gesti√≥n a tope y sensaci√≥n de construcci√≥n y desarrollo, le va a encantar, aunque se puede hacer bastante tediosa toda la gesti√≥n, y eterna la partida dependiendo mucho de los gustos del jugador. 
Tres a√±os esperando edici√≥n en castellano, y de componentes... la edici√≥n es car√≠sima y muy cutre! Lo de las minipir√°mides es que es imperdonable, a la m√≠nima se te mueve todo... ¬¨¬¨ Son demasiado peque√±as las casillas de puntuaciones, el dise√±o del tablero en ingl√©s est√° mejor. He usado piedras transparentes para marcadores de felicidad, y si puedo har√© sustitutos para el resto. Las ilustraciones, son horribles, cualquier ilustrador novel las har√≠a mejor. Solo hay que ver fotos en BGG. El manual est√° mal estructurado, no te esperas que te cuenten las reglas "asi". El resto puede pasar, incluso me gustan los cubos de pl√°stico de colorines. Pero en general, es de los peores juegos calidad-precio que tengo en cuanto a dise√±o-componentes, pareciendo por dentro un prototipo apenas adornado.
El juego en s√≠ es una pasada, s√≥lo tiene un "fallo" gordo, muy muy largo... casi estuvimos 8h una 1a partida a 3 con novatos entre explicaci√≥n mucho AP, etc... En fin, para aut√©nticos fans de los civi y con mucha mucha paciencia...

Vendido, ya que es mucho m√°s corto y funciona mejor online que en mesa.

RATING: 9
To anyone reading this, heed my advice:
Make sure you have no other appointments the same day, bring a lunch box along, turn off your cell phone and enjoy the game.

I like this a lot. A long but rewarding game that keeps you in its grip. At the first play you can't have a decent strategy (don't even try to have one), because there are just too many cards to learn. But you'll do better next time, when you know what to aim at. 

There is a constant shortage of resources which forces players to make important decisions all the time. You cannot accomplish everything and hence you need a strategy. It is really rewarding to see your plan come into reality. The balance between longer term strategic and short term tactical decisions is spot on.

A few of things to whine about: 
First one is the fiddliness. The pieces are ridiculously small for anyone to handle comfortably. 

The second one is the counter intuitive corruption mechanism. It is an integral part of the game and it has to be there. However, now a big part of your game is actually about managing those blue production tokens so that you have precisely the number that does not trigger higher corruption. This forces you to focus on big productivity leaps instead of grinding your way there gradually. Yes, it is the nature of the game, but in my opinion it takes too much energy in a game that should not be about micromanaging. 

The third one is about the game length with four. Ideally more players should introduce more interaction and thus add to the excitement. This might happen but at the same time downtime increases drastically, and so does the game length. 

Verdict:
Absolutely one of the best games, but only with three players. In the end, I decided to sell the game. This just never hits the table because "it's too heavy", "I have to take the dog for a walk", "I have to blahh blahh". You get the point. TtA is a total pain to teach as well. Hence, as a part of the process of ridding me of unnecessary fire load TtA had to find a new caring home. I am going to miss you baby. Hope to see you sometime.

I like the game, very good theme implementation.
Some of the mechanics take a while to get, and you definitely need an idea on what's in the game in total, to play even moderately successful. So consider your first game an intro, and nothing more.
I think the game is quite brutal in punishing even small development inefficencies, so it might not work well to play with different levels of skill. I seldom got so frustrated in a game about getting so blasted away after seemingly doing good just three round before.
Probably a bit like chess - a better opponent will always win clearly, as errors add up exponentially.
Still, I want to try again.

We used the quick start guide to jump straight into a 3-player full game.  It really felt like playing Civ!  I got totally rocked, but I feel like I learned a bunch, and am eager to play again.  I will wait until the next game to rate this one, but I have a positive outlook.

Currently my favourite game of all, this has stood up to many repeated plays and I still haven't got my head around ideal play in different situations; the theme is perfect for me, streamlined civilization building without all the assymettry of a map that tends to create unbalanced games. the cards feel perfectly balanced, highlighted by different groups thinking different cards are broken, they rarely are they are just all situational.

Played with a fast group of two to three players this is a perfect game, I don't particularly like 4 player games as they seem to drag a bit too much.

Wow.  Just a great, [i]great[/i] civ game.  I really enjoyed playing this one and I'm definitely looking to pick it up when the next print run comes out.

The random element is in the card draw.  Works very well, though, since the cards are separated into five ages.  The card powers and strength directly correlate with the advancement of the game (the current age), providing an excellent development mechanism.  I also like using the cards as the clock.

Takes a while to play, but entirely worth it.  For game length alone, I do not recommend playing with 4 players unless they're all experienced with the game.

The 3-player (2 newbs, 1 teacher) learning game I played took around 6-7 hours.  The 4-player (3 experienced & me) took about 5 hours.  Like I say above, 4-player isn't horrible if the players are experienced and really try to keep it moving.

Rated a 9 instead of 10 simply because game length, and length of a teaching game (which can be considerable), will often preclude plays for me.  Yes, that's largely due to the wonderfully implemented complexity, but it's enough for me to drop my rating a notch.  If there were a way to bring it out more often and get more plays in, it would rate a 10.

And yes, I know there's the shorter beginner game, but I really enjoy the complexity and choices of the longer non-beginner (advanced?) game.  The duration isn't a minus for the game itself per se, I'm more annoyed that the game length will prevent me from getting many plays in.

If you have any interest in deep games that enable long-term strategies with *tons* of choices, try this one.  You won't be disappointed (unless you are).

We played a couple of turns of the simple game.  I think the rules are somewhat elegant and clever, love the idea of building a civilization, and like that it is a card game.  "Seeding" events seems fun, and rumor has it the 2-player advanced game can be done in under two hours once you know what you're doing.

UPDATE:  After one advanced game, I'm calling this a seriously good game.  It's long, but I don't know how that can be avoided.  The mechanics work, it's not too annoying to keep track of things, and it moves along.  Yes, you can take a break during your opponent's turn.  It's good enough to make me want a full game next time (Mrs. alexd trounced me by clever military among other things).

Ok, the full game is even better, though it pretty much adds an hour and a half, at least at first.

Seems like playing an age an evening for a few days might be the way to go -- take a break, ponder your progress, mull over the layout over breakfast...

Ok, the full game is fantastic, AFTER Age I.   Playing less than the full game seems like a foolish waste of time -- the overhead for the good part is too high.

UPDATE:  Ok, so.  In theory there's a lot to like here.  In practice, 2p, between making mistakes in resource management/cardplay if you're trying to play at a reasonable pace but make time for thinking, the game ends up taking FOREVER and having a disturbing "some mistake was made" feeling that isn't there in most things I like.  I love the idea here, in some ways, but the actual game isn't as great, after more plays, as I thought.  Perhaps... if the leaders were more balanced?  If there were more interesting eventful turns rather than slow runups to the occasional war?  It's not REALLY a 10, in some ways (well it may be when it's firing on all cylinders, but that often fails to happen, and it sure takes a long time for it), but... eh, at its best its great.  Just a warning -- it's not perfect.  Is it infinitely more fun and cooler than Agricola?  OH YEAH

RATING: 6.5
:cry: :) :D :) This is a perfectly serviceable and well-made ultra-long game. It didn't amaze me the way my top three ultra-long games (18xx, Twilight Struggle, Maria) do. But it's a LOT more fun than some things I've played of roughly equal length. It's got a bit too much direct confrontation via military actions to ever really be a favorite, but I'd at least be willing to try this one again (we played the Advanced game with just two ages and honestly if one player was not taking forever and a day on her turns, it might have gone over better with me). The down side is we had a runaway leader problem although he was a much more advanced player than the rest of us (two newbies and one guy who said he's not very good at it); however I found it nearly impossible to get culture, which is VP, and advancing culture advances your VP increase every round. Our runaway leader had a "leader" card which gave him a colony bonus, and a military nobody could assail (by the time you got your military up to his, he built even further so you could just never attack him on your next turn). Twiddling everything every round was annoying (also the "leader" kept moving the wrong pieces; the board is AWFUL for scoring/tracking purposes -- it's straightforward but it's too small and too easy to screw up things that are changing constantly -- having the levels of stuff on your OWN board AND the main board, while redundant, would be my recommendation) And it's basically a tableau builder, which is something I don't mind. The resource mechanic is very, very good in the game... very economical and clever. But, once again, I played a top ten BGG game and found myself asking, "that's what people find so amazing?" I mean, it was adequate and I can't think of anything downright terrible about it, but my socks weren't exactly knocked off. 

Second impression knocked it back to a 5; I'll play, but the military stuff makes it into "bash the loser" so if you fall behind you will just get utterly pummeled and continue to fall further behind. And that's really, REALLY stupid for a four hour game (the Full Game rules must recognize this, as resigning is a legal move!). You're basically forced to play a certain way, which sucks out a lot of the fun. Especially since the rest of the game is very good; if military aggressions and wars were waged against some unseen enemy, rather than other players, I'd feel a lot better about this game.

Third impression after lots of plays gets it to a 6. I'll play it but mostly because I'm stubbornly trying to "get it" rather than because I love it. Once you start having a clue what to do it becomes less painful but this is a game you have to really stick with to come to appreciate, and the online version helps a ton with that. I'll never LOVE the take-that, bash-the-weak mechanics, but I at least got decent enough to no longer find them completely crippling.

Long length is a drawback, but its very good.

I learned it at midnight, played again after finishing (to 7am!!) and then woke up at noon and played again.  So it must be cool.

Increased rating after 10 plays.  This is one of the only long games that is worth the time it takes.  (Along with Die Macher and maybe Game of Thrones)

Flawed, fiddly but interesting attempt at a bronze-age-to-space-age mutiplayer civilization game. The rules barely convey with the designer intended. Pictures in the rules seem designed to break up the text rather than illustrate. The rules need a glossary and a legend. The Game Designer card is silly and doesn't belong in the game.

The best shortish civilisation game I have played.

I really like this game. I need to play through some more before i decide how high this is going.

Will epic strategy conquer feeling of fiddeliness?

Edit 15/01-11: Yes, yes i does. This game is really deep, and every choice you make feels important to your strategy. Can be somewhat unforgiving, but not absolute. It pays of to know the cards, so don't expect to win if it is your first game. Still, this game really gives you the epic feel of building a civilization. Full game takes time, but is definitively worth it.

I love this game. I've played it 3 times so far and every time it's a new experience. Seriously great game. Lots of choices.

Lots and lots of fiddly bits and turn maintenance.

A fun game where you actually go from the days of Caesar all the way to Jet Fighters and Tanks.  I really enjoy this game, but the play strongly depends on who you are playing with.  The rules are fiddly on a lot of aspects with some detail rules that are easy to look over and can frustrate players who haven't memorized them.  Also, this game really suffers from AP players.  You start with 4 actions per turn, which can turn into 10 actions per turn by the end of the game, and you are flooded with choices (which I like for me, but dislike for AP players).  The only luck is the card draw, but it affects all players pretty equally.  Combat is resolved by #military units and formations (with a couple minor card bonuses), and no dice are rolled the entire game.  (not sure if that is good or bad :) )

2-4(3)

I'm going to bump this to 10. I just keep wanting to play it.

---------------------------------------------------------

I've gotten this and played it (2p) a couple of times. We jumped straight into the Full game. I don't understand why anybody would start with the Simple game, as I feel the experience would muddy the waters for the Full game, and a LOT of what makes this game phenomenal comes out in the Full game. The rule book is a little bit too constrained in trying to force you into the Simple->Advanced->Full game progression, which made it REALLY difficult to just jump into a full game. I've tended to notice this about Vlaada's games: the rules hold your hand through learning the game (in some "training wheel" sort of way), but they subsequently are very poor as a reference for more experienced players or fuller versions of the game (Space Alert and Galaxy Trucker are both like this). Rules summaries here helped immensely.

ANYWAY, there are a lot of (really small) bits and you spend much of the game shuffling them about, but it does feel like a really rich thematic experience, with different ways to advance yourself and win. Yeah, a lot of the cards seem really weak compared to others, but there are a lot of interesting things to do. Military is brutal (of course), but still nicely favors the defender. I'm not sure if the Age IV business is necessary (maybe we played it wrong) but it made the game feel a bit overlong without much going on (as in, we both had way more actions than we felt we needed). It's definitely long, and some games can certainly feel like big runaways, but otherwise, it's a marvelous experience.

RATING: 7
Initial rating after playing 1 3p with 2 experienced and myself as the newbie.  Run away game since I was not able to keep up with the arm race.  The event cards and agression cards reward the strong and there is no real way to catch the leader.

First the downsides. The designers clearly gave zero effort to the game's art. Basically all the components look terrible. Gameplay-wise, some of the mechanics (particularly growth, happiness, and corruption) are a bit of a pain to keep track of. 

However, this is a wonderful empire building game, allowing you to make many interesting choices to assemble a flourishing society. The game offers many different ways to interact with your competitors (by competing for cards, by invasion, most prominently), and there are multiple viable paths to victory. I would say that focusing on military is a little bit too effective in this version.

The only negative is that the game takes over an hour per player and that it is a bit fiddly. (I dont have a problem with long fiddly games as long the gameplay worths the hustle and this one certaintly does) So, you need to find the right group of players. The game offers a wide selection of choices. There are a lot of things going on, many paths to follow. I like the feeling that you start with almost nothing and you have to build up a real economy and increase your cultural and science payout while you must keep the people happy and the corruption down. There is also the military aspect that makes the game much more interactive with the various aggression and war cards. 
Its a very well designed civilization board game. Excellent game.

Temporary rating of 8 after only basic games. I feel that the game play won't change a lot, but it has premises for a 9 at least. The complexity of the game makes it very enjoyable and challenging.The only drawback I see so far is the rule book. But that you only have to go through once or maybe twice. Than, it's all about playing and this games raises to the expectations.
Update: Played the advanced game, except that it's a bit too long, it is a brilliant game. Rating changed to 9

Yes, okay. It's good. Very good, indeed. The rules are learnable in under 10minutes, even though it has tons of depth, complexity and variability.

65‚Ç¨ is too much for this game. Elementary school artwork, cheap quality cards, non-ergonomic tokens, board full of errors. 
The game takes way too long to play and has very little player interaction (almost none besides wars and raids. Where the hell is trade? The most essential part of civilization growth is missing). Turns take an age to resolve. Try it with 4 you will never forget it....

It should deserve a 6 but i rate it 3 for being overhyped.

Admirably complex and ambitious.  I am impressed.  But how about playability?  How about all that down time between turns?  How about all those tokens you have to move back and forth just to perform the bookkeeping in the game?  In the final analysis, for me, the pain is not worth the pleasure, not to mention it takes an eternity to play.

I like the resemblance of this game to the Sid Meier computer games. The game is too long though, mostly because of huge amounts of downtime. Sometimes you will wait for 20-30 minutes to get the turn again.

Part of me wants this game to be shorter so that it can make it to the table more often. But part of me knows that that's what makes this game so cool; it's an experience. This IS Civilization (the computer game) in a board game. You WILL forget that there is no map.

Update:
I LOVE this game! Changed it to a 10... The only ten I have. It's long. If you can't handle a long game, then stay away. But if, for any reason you think you can get at least one other person to invest the time with you on the game, you will not be dissapointed.

Second update:
I have never played a game with this much depth. I've played maybe 20 games now (on boardgaming-online.com), and still come back for more. Now if only I could figure out how to win more than 10% of the games I play... Eesh

Final Update: I've traded the game away. I loved this game, but darn it, it took too long to play. I will not change my 10 rating, because I think the game deserves it. It's just a matter of me never having enough time to finish the game. I'll still play it online.

Second Final Update (Just go with it): I have played Sid Meier's Civilization the Board Game... I am impressed. It has made me reconsider my rating of Through the Ages. I had more fun with Civ, however, it was only one game, so I'm going to be adjusting the two scores as I get more plays of Civ. But as it stands right now, Civ might knock TtA down a bit. 

I think it comes down to play time and that, in spite of my appreciation for the elegance of TtA, I think Civ appeals to my visual/spatial tendencies more, what with the map and all. Darn I like that map. We shall see.

Game seems a tad fiddly.  Players, especially new players, can find themselves in poor positions that may not be fun to play.  Best way to play this game is the Full Game, which takes a long time.  Lots of flavor for a euro.  Component quality is close to shameful on the edition that I played (1st edition from FRED).  It is a great game but has been less fun on repeat plays, went from 9 to 8 after maybe 10 plays and after 5 or so more plays has fallen further.  Maybe I just need a break.

I bought this a while ago and I've been waiting to get a chance to try it with two other civ-minded friends.  In the end I was underwhelmed.  It's nicely designed but it's a lot of time and work moving tokens around for the payoff.  It felt like there were shorter, more streamlined games that offered the same thing in the end.

There also wasn't very much player interaction, and I felt I could just as easily have spent the hours moving cards around by myself.  To be fair, none of us tried to build more military than the others and attack -- until the final rounds -- so that made it more solitary than normal.

I'd give it another try.  It would probably improve with some familiarity.

This game is okay.  I think it's a little over-hyped, honestly, but it's not terrible by any means.

The primary problems with it have been listed by others- mainly that there is SO much downtime, and that once you're down, you're out.  If a person doesn't build his military to something respectable, he doesn't stand a chance.  And once you're at that point, you CAN'T get back into the game.  That's worse than being eliminated- stuck playing a game for another 3 hours where you have 0 chance to affect the outcome, or even do anything on your turns.  Yay.  It didn't get that bad for our game- but I could easily see that being the case.  And I had to refrain from attacking the player just so it WASN'T the case- he had no way to stop me, and I had the cards and military to successfully screw him over every turn.  

I'll play it if others want to, but I can't see getting excited about it.

Civilization I for PC adapted to Boardgame.

RATING: 7
Very intriguing. After 1st play, I immediately wanted to play again. And that's to say something of a game that took almost 8 hours (4 player - longer than I anticipated), and the time being around 2:30 am.

(2nd play - 6 hours, 3 players)

The rules are longish, but the main mechanics very logical once you get into the game. You soon stop to worry about rules, and start to worry about your strategy (except for certain card combinations where you need to consult rules and/or FAQ).

There's a lot going on, and a lot of variables to factor into your game plan. Aggression and events take a bigger role than I anticipated from reading the rules alone.
While in theory each player plays on his own, with an occasional conflict (and snatching cards away from other players), the game feels much more interactive in reality.

It's also one of those games where you need one play to get a feel for the flow, because you'll need different amounts of food/resources/science/happiness in different phases of the game.

It can be very frustrating. When you make a major blunder (almost bound to happen in the first game), you'll have your work cut out for you, just getting back on track. Especially when playing with aggressive players - as in real life, aggression breeds more aggression, and as army sizes increase, you must follow or get sucked dry by the other players.

There's some luck in card draw, otherwise, a skill game.

Feels like Civ the computer game in board game form. Fiddly, long, and can suffer huge downtime. I would play again if the game moved a little quicker as there are a lot of interesting things going on in here. War seems particulary brutal if you're on the wrong end and getting your head around the workers=buildings thing is a bit tricky at first.

I can easily understand the popular complaints about OP military, card luck, play length, downtime, fiddliness, you name it.  Didn't get a real personal-ownership kind of sense of my stuff either, because there are only a few classes of card and card modifiers.  Despite all this, though, I easily love and continue to come back to the game.  With all the pieces put together, it's one of my favorite games.  There are other long games I enjoy, but none which seem to erase time like this.  I think it's worth at least a shot or three for just about any gamer.  Strongly prefer 2P to all other forms, and online for speed.

Advanced game only.

I'm not convinced. It's a mixture of old mechanics with a theme you barely notice (you upgrade cards, and more cards, and more cards). Very long and downtime gets insane. It's an ok game, but not worth half the time it takes to play.

Very nice complex game.  I really want to play it some more, especially since I've got a better handle on the rules now.  Biggest complaint is the itty bitty components.

Absolutely brilliant game! Mr. Chv√°til, you have done an amazing thing here. I especially like the challenge of keeping up with your opponent's military in anticipation that they might attack whilst also attempting to advance your civilization's culture and technology. So much to attend to here. I do not mind shuffling the resources and workers around on the board at all. In fact, I find the entire balancing process fascinating.

12/2/16: Lowered this to an 7 because I've come to believe that the military really dominates this game and it must be in the forefront of your thinking.  Age III wars can really swing things.  This effect is lessened in the new version.

Think of this as a board game version of Sid Meier's Civilizaton.  I love Civilization building games, but this is not a short game, and would not appeal to everyone.  I think that 2-3 hours / player is typical when learning this game.  Played recently against someone using a military strategy, and the game is very fragile when defending against a military strategy.  You fall behind and you're toast.

I have the Czech edition.  The glass beads are cool, but hard to move, and I think that the cards are better in the FRED edition.  If you can get the Essen cubes for the Czech edition that's definitely the way to go.

3 players is definitely the sweet spot.

Fantastic civilization building game. Despite its length, it plays differently every game, requires EVERY choice to be deliberately thought out, and offers enough of a varied experience that no two games feel alike. 

Another benefit is that you must grapple with the situation of the game's technology cards; you aren't guaranteed to get all the cards you need to build your civilization. It rewards adapting as well as advancing.

RATING: 9
The best translation into a boardgame of the kind of mechanics that I really enjoy in the civilization computer games. Lots of good ideas to streamline resource management, but it's still a fairly long game, and probably too long with 4 players.

I should add that the rating is based on a limited number of plays where the predominant strategy was warm, lovey, peaceful sweet feelings towards everyone else. Not so sure how I would enjoy it when the fundamental strategy is cutthroat, no holds barred, military build up.

RATING: 7
Long and tedious to play, this one still feels interesting due to some smart mechanics in play. It's not even hard to get into it and I have to attest it some issues with draw-related luck. 

Also, it's one of those games you should never play with a cat around.

This is the kind of game where you think about how you are going to play the next time. Very random thanks to the cards, so every game wont play the same. Very fiddly with small components and it is very easy to make mistakes all the time. Quite abstract for new players while it all makes sense once you get it and the mechanics are really clever. Lots of dead time, it takes a lot of time to play on 4 players. Some of the leaders can give a player large point bonuses every round, making it very hard to catch up. The luck of the card draws can have a huge impact on the game, which I don't think goes well with such a long game. It's an excelent 2 player game, full game on 2 takes 3 hours but you don't have to wait so much.

This game was really really hard for me to rate. It's really good, and really elegant. It's near perfect in translating the Civ series computer games to a board game, and yet therein lies its fatal flaw.

I just don't see myself ever wanting to play it for these reasons: 
1) It's so long, and it would speed up the more you play but there's little chance you'll get to play it enough with the same group to make that happen

2) It's so fiddly...I generally have only had a "fiddly" problem with one other game so far - Antiquity but this is fiddly in a different way. Rather than just tons of very tiny bits to add and remove and track here there's so many different things to track and keep track of that it's very easy to cheat either on purpose or accidentally. I guess it's like that time I tried to play Arkham Horror with about 4 expansions - just too much to track...this is definitely something that PCs were made for. Tracking everything properly so you get it right turn after turn.

...and there's the rub...

For me if I wanted to play this I'd just play Civ 3, 4 or 5 on the PC and convince my friends to try play that. As complex as this game is it's still not as complex as the PC version (because it really can't be)...finally the PC experience also allows to play by mail over time that a board game has a much harder time to facilitate.

So do I rate it by how much I like it? Which is probably between an 8 and a 9, or how much I want to play it and - for me - how little of a space I feel it adequately fills in my gaming repertoire? Which is probably between a 3 and a 4. In the end I guess I'll pace it somewhere in the middle

Un 10 en la BGG supone querer jugarlo siempre... Pues eso es el Tta.
Me chiflan las mec√°nicas de la poblaci√≥n relacionada con la comida y con el handicap de la felicidad. Me chiflan los recursos relacionados con las minas, y su vez con la corrupci√≥n. Estos dos circulos que producen dolores de cabeza pero que si los controlas como es debido da placer ver c√≥mo te permite avanzar en otras esferas del juego. El mecanismo de la ciencia es perfecto. Tan sencillo y a la vez tan complejo. Todo est√° interrelacionado.
Me tiene enamorado que cada carta est√© pensada y que tengas un mont√≥n de estrategias seg√∫n cu√°l escojas. Las maravillas son simplemente geniales. Los l√≠deres lo mismo.
La mec√°nica militar, el esfuerzo que se debe hacer para que funcione correctamente y ver c√≥mo puedes atacar a tus "enemigos" me parece simplemente brillante. Y el hecho de que lo militar no prime sobre lo dem√°s, y c√≥mo est√° conseguido √©sto, me parece la reordiga.

Tengo ganas de seguir aprendiendo en cada partida, el juego tiene tant√≠simo recorrido que me encanta sentarme y probar por d√≥nde va a discurrir la partida. Todo me parece elegante. Nada es forzado. Todo tiene l√≥gica.

No encuentro mejor manera de estar una tarde con amigos que jugando un Tta. Eso es un 10: querer jugarlo siempre. Pensar en √©l y decir "bien, me encantar√≠a ir a lo militar. Si esta vez logro hacerme con el control del juego voy a salirme con mis teatros o con mis laboratorios, o mis avances tecnol√≥gicos...".

Yet another good game by the great Vlaada. I really liked this one, although the huge amount of options you tend to have each turn make for a very AP-prone experience, sadly.

If this was a more streamlined game, it would surely rank much higher for me. As it is, it's a game I enjoy, but one I just couldn't play anytime... I would have to have a lot of available time, and not the urge to play anything else that session.

UPDATE: With the new version out, it's rare that I would prefer to play this older, less streamlined version. Still a well designed game, but pales in comparison to the newer, and cheaper version.

RATING: 8
Simple Game felt way too short to accomplish anything, despite it taking 3 hours for reading/understanding rules + setup + first play. Hopefully the Advanced Game will be more satisfying but not take considerably longer (now that we're familiar with the rules)

Advanced Game was great, I liked the "goals" to shoot for, and it extended the game without making it too long.

Full Game was not too great. I didn't feel like the Age III cards added that much besides just more of the same (plus bonuses, bonuses, bonuses) and it took MUCH longer to play (about 50%).

All in all, I still love the game, but I think I'll be mostly sticking to the Advanced Game until I'm familiar enough for it to play faster.

Fantastic game (most of my plays are against friends but online)

the start of the game feels wonderfully wide open with so many possibilities.  The mid-game feels tight and tense.  The end game a desperate grab for whatever you can get (as long as you haven't been obliterated by another player's army)

It's a game that feels remarkably close to the computer civs even without the map.  The downside is of course the playtime (which is why I generally play online).  Most people say that face-to-face games should be 2 or 3 players only, which sounds right to me.

A game that deserves its stellar reputation.

Barely played it so far face to face, but I love this game and play it online a lot. Would be a 10 but the potential for incredibly lame endgame scenarios involving wars and the metagame of whether players will resign or not means this one doesn't quite acheive perfection. It would be a 10 if I could magically make everyone agree that resignation is the right move, but some people insist on staying in the game and that has the potential for a sour ending. It would still be a very good game without resignation, too- just not quite as rich, strategically. Indeed, I think I would rate it a 10 either with resignation or without. It's purely the "will they or won't they" guess-your-opponent's-gaming-philosophy metagame aspect that is truly a big enough flaw to warrant not giving a 10.

Fiddly, with a steep learning curve, but ultimately a winner.

This is an okay game, but it is a bit long for what it offers.  The combat system isn't very interesting to me, and as such tends to play as a more peaceful game than I'd expect from a Civ game.  Likewise, the limited technologies doesn't lend itself well to my play style.  When it comes to Civ games, I think that the new Civilization game by Fantasy Flight really implements everything better than this game.

Rating depends on number of players. With four players, the rating falls. With three players it's a good game. Reasonable game with two players, although not as good with three. 

In many senses, this isn't a 'good' game. There's a lot of luck as to when certain cards hit, and so you are really playing a long game that's just watching the order of the cards. But I enjoy it, from time to time.

Update -- Still a decent game, but one I feel no strong urge to play often. 

Indifferent.

So I played the game again more and I think it is one of the best games now.  My issue before with military cards are due to my inexperience and not valuing military action cards as much as I should have.  I am still interested in splitting up the military decks to see how different the game plays out.  It doesn't mean that military is worth less, just quite the opposite.  This is one of the very few multi-faction wargame that I enjoy because it doesn't matter how often people attack me, I don't lose military strength as long as I keep up with everyone else.  This game will definitely last Through the Ages.
Rating: 7 -> 10

So I got to play the game again today and the military card draws reared its ugly head.  Military and military cards are so important in this game that just not having the right cards can ruin you.  You cannot fall behind of military or you won't be able to get out of that hole once you start getting attacked.  Thus these military cards are very important.  Not drawing the right tactics card will cost you the game.  Not getting the events when you are ahead in military while your opponents getting them when they are in the lead is just too much for me to swallow.  This randomness in the military cards for how long the game takes is too much for me.  I proposed splitting the military card deck into 3 that contains specific kinds of cards.  This way if you need a certain military card, your chances of getting it is higher but not guaranteed.  So this tempered my desire to purchase the game.  The game is still good, but the luck to length ratio pushes me not to purchase the game.

I got to play this game again after a long time and I enjoyed myself.  Even though the game took 4 hours to complete with 4 players, I was completely engaged and enthralled.  I didn't notice that the time has gone.  This is a very good Civ themed game.  It does a very nice job with the arcing story for the game.  I am tempted to buy a copy.

Suppose to be a good heavy "civilization" game.  A card game to boot for compactibility.  Maybe for my 3 player Heavy game niche.  Reading further threads, I am wary that there might be too much luck in here for me for its length.  There seems to be a consensus that the game should not be played more than 3 players.  Given at the moment that I play with my wife and another couple, will make this game untouched.  Also the fact that the game is a 3 hour game.  Also, the general consensus seems to be that this game is not good with 4 players, since 90% of my gaming is 4 player.

Reading the forums here about misprints on the board, missing components and curling cards certainly makes it very hard to justify spending $70 on it.  I shall wait for the next version to purchase the game.

Just one incomplete game (up to nearly the end of era II), but a very satisfactory experience.  It is long, sure, but it is not soooo complex.  You have to be careful with a few little details that are easy to forget, though.  Quite inmersive, the first impression is that everything is well thought and connected.  Just needs time and patience.  Likely to be a really enjoable experience once you get used and the game flows a bit faster that in a learning game.
It is not the most beautiful game, but it is functional.

After almost two dozens plays it starts to burn out for me, I feel like I'm doing same things in each game, following the same path. Adding to this its inherent problems like long downtimes, a lot of micromanagement and bookeeping (which causes frequent mistakes and ommisions) and I'm less and less eager to play it.

This is a very good game, pure fun of taking decisions, solving problems and growing your Civilization - it is too heavy to rate it a 10 as it won't hit the table each time there is a gaming time, but nonetheless - I would love to play it most of times.

A little tough to learn and the rules could have been written a lot better but this is a favorite for 2 players.  Not for 4 if I can avoid it though...just too long.  But with 2-3 the depth and different strategies of this one keeps me coming back.

This game has some huge drawbacks: it's very long, it's incredibly fiddly (one must be very careful with the upkeep), and the production quality is quite awful. Anyway, if one goes beyond these drawbacks, the game ROCKS! The number of choices one faces, and the number of different paths to victory is awesome. Every time I play it, I can feel it growing on me.

This is my favourite game that I have no idea how to play and lose badly all the time :) The mechanics work here great, they create a complex but very interesting game. The big variety of technology cards give you the possibility to push your civilization in many different paths.You really have the feeling of building a civilization. It can be annoyingly random sometimes when you play more. 

simple rules - I haven't played them but I don't believe I would like them. Too little time to do anything fun.

advance rules - good as an introduction for the first few games.

full game - the real beauty.

(Later) Reluctantly, we have decided not to play this game any more. It is just too long and too difficult (always have to keep referring to the rule-book). It's a good game, but not for us. Gave it to Bill.

RATING: 7
Complex, smart, nice designed game. The game is very well balanced with lots of possibilities, but my score isn't that impressive because there's almost no interaction between the players. Sometimes it looked like we were making a puzzle instead of competing each other. So translate this game again to a board and it would be a topgame. The gameplay is indeed much better then Civilization - the boardgame, but I prefer Tresham's civilization above through the ages.

Excellent, but I don't especially enjoy the full game with all 3 ages; it's a theme issue for me - I don't like modern civilization as much. Some leaders seem OP, depending on how long of a game you're playing.

My favorite game to play next to WoTR.  It has such a variety that even after a 100+ plays it's still as fresh as the first time i played it.

This is really the best Civ boardgame that exists today.  I am hoping the new FFG civ game provides Civ players with a bit lighter version of TTA so a 4 player game can be played in about 2 hours.

Update:  Since getting Nations TTA's has for the most part been replaced.  It's a great game but Nations just does so many things better.  TTA's will always be the one that started the great Civ games for me though.

Another Update:  With the release of the NEW edition this game is back on top.  The new design is a much better game and has eclipsed nations now IMO.

I like the concept of having a single leader for each Age, building stuff and the need to keep your people happy with smiley faces.  However, I do find it a little too long and random.  The millitary cards are especially random!  It's annoying when you cannot take advantage of your superior millitary simply because you fail to draw any aggression or war cards.  

Your choice of actions are heavily dependent on the card drafting queue.  Obviously you get to choose your cards, but the order the cards appear will largely determine the game.  Even so, I still overall enjoy TTA.

An excellent civilization themed game that does away with the map and concentrates on interaction between cards, resource allocation, and military combat. It is not a 10 only because I like maps!

Repeated plays have shown that luck plays an increasing role in a game between skilled players, specially in a 4p game. Considering lowering my rating.

RATING: 7.4
All my plays online.  There is much I dislike about the game.  It is over long, over fiddly, over abstracted (everything is kind of reduced to stone cost, tech cost and production of 1 of 5 resources with very little twisting from the basic pattern.  There is a bit too much rules that could have been streamlined but where the game really struggles is in the military side of things.  This can create a situation where the rich get richer and the poor spend the last 3rd of the game doing absolutely nothing other than seeing everything they have worked on be slowly destroyed.  Some like the tension of staying ahead but I think if a game can stop being fun for a player for more than a turn or two it is a design flaw.  Also aside from that the military / event side isnt that interesting , nor is there enough reason to not just pummle the weakest nation.   However despite all these strong weaknesses there is still something very compelling here and your turns are a lot of fun.  I cannot think of a civ game I like more and with online play options the fiddle and overlong playing time are not much of a problem.

The perfect Civ game for 2-4 players. Everything fits together brilliantly.

Edit: Up to a 10 (rather than a 9) but only for 3 players. More or less detracts slightly from it, with 4 suffering heavily from downtime. Still superb with any number though.

2nd edit: Will no longer play this with 4 due to downtime.

Not played new version yet.

Best game I played for a long time and probably the best Euro game in my collection. Especially astonishing are the following aspects, which I miss in nearly any other Euro:

- The theme is not pasted but tightly connected with the mechanisms and very narrative.

- A lot of player interaction, which is not only indirect (card row and events) but in many cases very direct and very harsh (war and aggression cards).

-  Since I like long games, the epic scale of the game really got me. 3-6 hours is just fine for me. Anything shorter wouldn't allow me to get into the atmospheare of a game (i.e. with shorter playing time I tend to focus on mechansims and forget about the flavor).

Got me hooked up the first time I played it and each new game grants a new challanging experience.

Be warned: Downtime can be quite long (new and or ap prone players) and there may be player elimination. Most contemporary games try and manage to avoid those concepts, this one doesn't care.

RATING: 7.5
First Play: Despite downloading and reading the rules pre-game, we spent an hour before the game just running through it.Ouch! This game is demanding both with regard to learning curve and discipline required to ensure you do things correctly and in the right order. We all made mistakes so there is a need to be extra vigilant to ensure you are all doing things properly. There is an incredible game in there meshed up in a complex mechanism, but be aware the first play must be written off as a learning experience. Be grateful to get to the end and to have mastered the nuances.

Second Play: Another long session reading and rereading the rules before attempting the full game. There are lots of little details that are very easy to miss so a few notes to one side help a great deal. Once you get into a rythmn the action flows very nicely, there's always more to do than your actions or resources allow and you do need to keep the military topped up to stop being mugged.A marathon plate spinning exercise but a very well balanced game. Definitely to be played with those of equal experience and understanding of the rules. Rating increased.

Further plays have emphasised the importance of a secure military to defend, and attack when necessary. The don't pick on me variant is recommended to stop one player getting too down trodden.

After a long pause of 8 years between games and restarting to play on line, the 'anti-down trodden' variant seems even more crucial. Without it a player can be caught in an endless loop of being milked for points and resources so when it gets to their turn they don't have the means to reinforce or do anything. End of their turn they produce ready to be harvested all over again...rinse and repeat.

After playing all three difficulty levels and lengths of this game I have to admit that it is growing on me. I still feel that the game is a bit long and can have too much down time to be rated as high as it is, but I can appreciate the struggle to balance your resources, build military and expansion through leadership and technology. I think this one just needs several plays to appreciate due to the fairly think rule book and endless possibilities for strategy.

We played the Basic game 2 player. It was actually very simple to understand with only 2 checks of the Rulebook once we got under way. The simplicity and length of the Basic Game are it downfalls. I would have loved to play through Civil Decks II and III. The game ended right when we started getting some good buildings in play. We will try the Advanced Game in the next couple of days and I will update my rating if it changes. 

EDIT, played the Advanced game, 2 player on 6/15/17

I would rate the Advanced Game a 9.00. It is better than the Basic game simply for the fact that it is longer. You have more time to build up your empire. Scores were 188-151, by the way. No Wars or Pacts, since we were just 2. The Events deck is a whole new mechanism that I really enjoy. I like how you can seed the Future deck. We did a little bit of Aggression but not too much as our armies were pretty close in Strength the whole game. Colonies seem very powerful as I was able to get 2 extra blue and 3 extra yellow tokens with mine. Next up is Full Game over the weekend. I will update again after that.

EDIT, played Full game, 2 player, on 6/19/17

The Full Game I also rate as a 9.00. We played w/o Wars or Pacts in our game. Once you get basics down of moving Population and Resources/Food, rules are a breeze. We got into Age III fairly close together but Brian pulled away by playing a couple of early Event cards right when he got more Strength than me. Final scores were 189-147. I would only play the Full Game going forward, even teaching to new players. I am sure that I will not be playing with the War cards at any point in the future, however. They just seem to be incredibly overpowered. Aggression cards are ok though. Another to teach Flo at some point in the future as she has really taken to heavier style games recently. Keeper!

RATING: N/A
One of the best games ever made. Its not a easy game to get a feel of, opinions made of someone that played this game less than 5 times is incomplete. Its like asking someone that never learned to drive a bike how you feel about bicycling. First you need to internalize the mechanics in your brain and automate so you can focus on the strategy and start playing the game. 

There is in only one way to play, with all the rules, skip the other variants (its like playing tennis but removing the rules of serving). 

There are many interesting decisions to be made during the game, invest in infrastructure, culture or war. No option is a ever obvious since decisions you make have impact on early and late game. Knowing the cards and how they interact and makes combos will make you a better player, but sometimes being opportunistic have it rewards. All cards are not made equal, some leaders, wonders are better than others. But since the game uses a dynamic card offer that modifies the cost of cards bad cards can become god cards if you grab them in the right moment. This is a game with many layers upon layers and is always rewarding to play. Sometimes you might ask "why do I even bother playing other games when there are so few that can compare themselves with this one".

This should be retitled "Spreadsheet, the Game."  I prefer root canal to playing this thing.  Long and hyper-fiddly.  Despite its appearances, this game get rather unpredictable as various hidden scoring mechanisms can radically alter the game outcome.  I feel like you have to an expert knowing the deck of some 300 cards to play.  Bleh.  Who has the time?  Also, it does promote the 'beating up the weak guy' syndrome.

Two playings, 3 & 4 players, the advanced game both times.  Rules seem "loopholey" and difficult to reference.  There is a fair amount of downtime,  I found myself frustrated at times by the randomness induced by the cards and player ordering.  Events too often punish the weak (usually already in a losing position) and increase the strong (quite often the leader).  Still, despite really bringing up the rear of the pack most of the game, I found myself eagerly awaiting my turn as I attempted to rebuild/retool my civilization to finally work efficiently.  Doesn't quite scratch the Civ itch for me but starts to come close.  Looking forward to playing again.

Rating this an 8 for now after 4 plays.

In my first game one player had a huge army (thanks in large part to Napoleon) which he used to bash the weakest player repeatedly.  Though I did ok that game, it seemed to me that the game became very lopsided if/when one player falls too far behind in the arms race, and the luck of the card row makes the arms race a very random thing.

But my next three games, for the most part, saw a more balanced arms race.  In one game one player fell far behind, but that was because he spent too much for a colony.  He also quit the game two turns later, which was a good thing since it did not allow the other players to take too much from him.

So I'll keep this as an 8 for now, but it could go down if it looks like the arms race is just too random.

The best civilization game after Civilization, even though this is a totally different kind of civ-building game than the orginal Civilization, both are great games and to me TtA has come closest to achieving tha holy grail of civ-board games as the game that is like the original Civ but not as long. However, the downside is there is really bad run-away leader problem and no balancing for players left behind, which were very nicely taken care of in the original Civilization. TtA is also a heavy eurogame that requires a long time for rules explanation and learning. But the work needed to learn this is worth it.

Rating is based on several basic game plays; one solo advanced game and one advanced game with 3 players.  I love this game.  It has everything I want in a game:

a) multiple paths to victory;
b) tough decisions every turn;
c) deep and engaging gameplay.

Unfortunately, I'm afraid it may be hard to get on the table very often because other people find it:

a) takes too long to set up;
b) fiddly;
c) takes too long to play;
d) decisions are too difficult (analysis paralysis).

*Edit, I'm really enjoying this as a two player - advanced game (not full) - takes about two hours to play with very little downtime.

This game is fantastic.  Has a very strong feel of Civilization for the PC.  The length of the game might be too much for some people, but I enjoy sinking my teeth into a game with this much depth.  A little frustrating that the edition I have has new player boards, but the rules weren't updated to reflect that, making a little early confusion.

The more I play this game, the more interesting it is.  There are some amazingly difficult decisions in this game.  It's fabulous!

Marred by production issues, but absolutly brilliant. The game has deep, multilayered, strategy, while not being too intensive, its multiple game versions caters for many different people. The game suffers slightly with long-ish downtime however, but I'm struggling to find a better way to spend 3 hours.

My rating is based on the 3 player game. My rating for the 4 player game is substantially lower as it compacts upon the game's flaws (long downtime, low intereaction) while not increasing the fun of the game.

This game, for me, has lost it's shine. I'm starting to find that the game feels too similar with each play. While it's a good game that I will play again. I can't see myself playing it for a while. Thereby my former rating of 10 is no longer accurate.

Absolutely brilliant game. Long play time but by God its worth it. Amazingly balanced, tons of strategic options, lots of choice. Don't play with people prone to analysis paralysis - actually, DO play with them, just bring a book. It's still worth it. Fantastic with 2 or more. Will probably be one of the hardest games to teach that I own (even topping other Vlaada games like Space Alert and Dungeon Lords) but the trade off is you get a lot of strategic/tactical choices and a huge amount of control. Just the right amount of interactivity to keep you on your toes but not get too far behind. Brilliant, fantastic, wonderful.

Great civ game which makes you feel like you're actually building a Civilization in a fraction of the time of other games with the same feel. Lot's of agonizing choices to make and lot's of ways to victory! Components could have been a bit better.

Has since been replaced by the New Story.

Got my second game of this under my belt recently. Really liked it.

It's a bit long, so I can't say I "always want to play it" and give it a 10. So this game rates a 9 for me. But I have to dock it another half point because the four player game is excruciatingly too long. And that is slight shame. So then it's an 8.5.

I heartily recommend this game to anyone looking for a solid, meaty, civ-type game. Many have called it a Civ-lite game. I think that fits almost perfectly. I say almost because I think Civ-lite is actually an oxymoron. There can really be nothing lite about civilization as a theme, period. Civilizations are immense things and they take time to develop. Through the Ages, in comparison, only takes about 3-5 hours once you know the system. For developing a civilization, that's pretty short.

That said though Through the Ages manages to streamline its rules to the point where even though the game is taking a while to go through four whole ages of civilization, the mechanics feel straightforward and easy to understand. Once you get the hang of it, you really start to look forward to each turn as you begin to plan and scheme for how you want to develop your civilization. Some turns are quick and some take more time as you carefully organize your taken actions for maximum effect.

I really can't recommend this to anybody whose ideal game experience is 60-90 minutes of light/medium strategy. This one is a grower, not a show-er. I would heartily, recommend this to anybody as a great meaty game of civilization building that doesn't require fiddly complicated rules. If you like Euros and you like games that grow and give you room to accomplish lots of stuff in a game, and you are willing to spend 3-5 hours of fun, you simply must play this game!

Ok. Normally the long playing time would make me rate this one 1 to 2 lower, but this game makes the hours fly by like nothing else. 6 hour game last night felt like half an hour. Great stuff. Dream about it at night. Will probably itch to play this all the time, and not being able to... Damn...

Update: Second game in two weeks with the same guy got the playing time down to 3,5 hours. Love this game.

RATING: 6.5
Initial impression.

I would want to play again with less luck involved where possible.

It would be interesting to perhaps put military cards onto the track, two per action level (above the card deck, likely), as opposed to taking them randomly, not performing the "remove the lowest X cards" thing at the beginning of each turn.

One could then have a completely open hand, which would improve things for the mild bit of interaction that occurs between players.

Update:

I don't understand why I like this game so much.  I need to figure it out.  I do enjoy it, something about it.  Is it a similar early Agricola reaction?

Oh, and lesson learned - do not play 4 players with everyone relatively new, even "just" the advanced game.

12-26-08

After a few games, I'm starting to see what I enjoy and don't enjoy about the game.  I might like to try the non-aggression version of the game, although that hasn't been a factor in our games - there has typically been 1-2 aggressions per game.  I could see more being a frustrating experience, too much "take-that."

I'm enjoying it more and more, oddly.

The advanced game leaves one feeling empty and unfinished.  The full game is great but takes a long time.  The simple game is at least short and can leave one feeling relatively satisfied, you go through more-or-less one age, not just two, so you get a different sense of finishing.

The Full is the best, but getting people to take the time for it can be difficult to arrange.

I can see where the appeal and the high ratings for this game come from, but why is it that I never see anyone playing this?

While the game has interesting things going on; the learning curve, the somewhat overwrought rules, the downtime and the length of the game reduces it's rating for me.

Still, it's a worthwhile endeavor if you have half a day to spare.

I was thoroughly impressed with this on my first play. I liked it as much as or possibly even better than Nations. Very intense game where the hours just flew by. I couldn't believe that more than 4 hours had passed when we were done. Hard to get to the table due to the length, but I very much want to play this again.

Massive rating change. I dropped it to a 7. The game in itself is still amazing, but I see zero reason to play it after the release of the new and improved edition. If you can get this really cheap, then go ahead, otherwise get the new one.

The last of the top 10 games on BGG (as of Aug 2010) that I played.  As usual, it is in the top 10 for a reason and I like it a lot.  Seems like a game that I'll have to play a bunch before I can truly appreciate it.  But, one advanced game with 3 players was enough for me to know that it is very good.  There was one experienced player who ran away with it (around 90).  The other two of us were new (he'd played just once before) and we tied at 51.  I felt like I made some decent decisions, but I could see where I was getting hammered on points as I never really created a culture track engine.  Hopefully, I'll get to try this again before I forget everything I know.

Ummm.  Why is this thing rated so high? The engine is pretty solid, but isn't really better than multiple other build up your engine euros I've played.  The only real difference is that it takes 4 hours to play, but I see no justification for that time.

Also, the graphic design/layout/terminology is fairly bad.  When to score actual civ/science or move up your civ/science + tracker is ambiguous throughout the rules and cards.  The cards are somewhat confusing.  And, the rulebook does a poor job of explaining concepts and game flow, instead just listing things as if going through a sample game, but in three different layers (simple/advanced/full)

It's not that I didn't like it, but it was too long for what it was, and I have other games that do what it is trying to do but better.

Edit: Rating reduced. There simply are better 'civilization' style games that, while not representing the terminology of the computer games as well as Through the Ages, represents its style better

I like the mechanics, and its a fun euro game, but its gotten a cold reception due to the length. My group is all about long epic games, but a long euro almost never translates into epic, and even with the civilization feel, Through the Ages doesn't either. Still, I personally enjoy the engine building.

RATING: 10
A fantastic 4X style simulation with lots of agonizing decisions throughout.  You never seem to get to do everything you want to do, and you always want to do just one or two things more.  The pressure to expand and grow is kept up constantly, and the game keeps shifting and evolving at just the right pace, up to and including the third age (which I personally don't feel ends too quickly, as some have argued) and keeps the resolution of the virtual "fourth age" interesting.  Tons of fun!

This is a very complex game with a hefty amount of rules. I am not at stage yet where I really feel that the game flows, I have to check the rules all the time, and until I feel that I fully grasp the rules I cannot give it more than 8. But based on the potential I felt this game has, I am pretty certain I will give it a 9 later on. Not for the casual gamer, but for the hard core gamer this game has everything you might want.

Edit: I am raising this to 9. We don't play anything else just now. It is a brilliant game, with endless strategies possible.

A mix of euro and civ game mechanics that create a very good game.

The four player game's duration is a bit to much and the two player game plays very differently than multiplayer. The 2-player game also seems to have some optimal strategy that almost always wins in high-level play.

I think that the 3-player game and possibly the 4-player game if you can stand the duration and downtime are among the best boardgame experiences that one may have. Highly recommended!

TtA:ASoC captures the grand flavor and intensity of building and maintaining a nation... er... uh... through the ages.

Compared to the grand-poobah Civilization, TtA:ASoC is a much shorter game, it is however still rather lengthy, and downtime in a 4-player game can seem to last... er...uh... through the ages. The chaos factor of other player's card track selections and the outcome of events and aggressions can make long-term planning a tricky task requiring adaptablity laced with a touch of luck. Component-wise the game is adequate but definitley not preferable. The cards are quite nice, with decent artwork, though the scoring-board is a bit bland and the player's resource-cards are too small/user-unfriendly. The bits (microscopic beads, and wooden cones) are borderline annoying.

Ultimately, the overall design is very fluid, making for a fun and furious nation-management game that can be played during a weekday night.

Takes every atom of theme and fun from 7 Ages and places it into a resource management game for 4 players that takes about 4 hours to play. Minor production gripes (tiny markers and some initial confusion about the symbology) are overshadowed by the fun of managing a nation from cradle of civilization through the Internet Age. Fans of Age of Renaissance should enjoy this one quite a bit and is a great substitute if you can't get a full table for AoR. After one play.

1 partial play with 4.  Too long for the amount of fun to be had.  The game seems to be unnecessarily slow and plodding because it takes lots of civil actions to get anything accomplished.  Would play again and change some first game mistakes... mainly my failure to keep up with military... but I hate to spend half a day playing just one game.  Also, there's a fair amount of luck and a steep learning curve (for both gameplay and needing to know the cards).

This is a swish, sophisticated civ building game that does not outstay its welcome. There is an element of randomness in the way that cards are laid out for everyone to pick from, but this is nothing like as wild as the stupid cards in the original civilisation.

I like the variants in this game that allow you to call it a day after 2 ages instead of going on for all three, so you can make the game last as long as you have available to play it. Clever!

Wow, this is a heavy, sophisticated game. It has a number of different mechanics which seem to work intricately together, the creating of a civ engine while taking the opportunities you can from the card drafting mechanic. At times the game can seem dry, but at other times you have that satisfying feeling of surveying the growth and sophistication of the civilization you've created (even without a map). In my very limited experience it is very competitive; you're either desperate to keep pace with your opponent or fortifying your military to be able to weather a war. The only reason it's not a ten for me is that the game can run long and those moments of dryness can pop up. I acknowledge it's a different game, but if I have a desire for an epic brain burner, I'd probably choose Twilight Struggle nine times out of ten. If I were more Eurogame inclined, I might feel differently.

Update: It might just be too dry for the investment - at least for me. I have not often found myself interested in pulling it off the shelf as the theme doesn't fill the room as a game this heavy and long should. I'd pick Twilight Struggle ten times out of ten. I have to keep this at at least a seven just because of the design, though. If I do find myself in a resource optimization mood, this is this is where I'll go.

RATING: 5
As far as a game capturing the feel of Sid Meier's Civilization PC game, I feel this game gets it right.  The mechanics themselves are good, but there are some things that this games that I just can't forgive.

The first and biggest complaint is the length.  If you play this thing from start to finish, from Antiquity to the 3rd Age, you're looking at the better part of 4 hours.  I usually have no problem with long games, but my other gripes will explain why this game can be so excruciating to sit through. 

This is a game that will punish you for playing it incorrectly...which is fine, but I've found it nearly impossible to ever recover, since everything you're managing is so interdependent.

Through most of the game, this is a bit of a solo experience.  Every once in awhile, someone might declare an aggression on someone else, but the confidence to do that usually only belongs to one player.  Wars are interesting, but you're lucky if you see one within the first 3 hours.

Finally, the overall presentation.  So much of the design is counter-intuitive.  It's not impossible to figure out, but it makes introducing the game quite a chore.  The face of the card gives little indication as to what age it's from, the difference between the backs of the Age and Military cards from each age isn't significant enough, the rulebook is a mess, the game is RIDDLED WITH ERRORS (ON IT'S THIRD PRINTING!!!  INEXCUSABLE!), I hate the stupid little wooden discs, the artwork is ugly, the boards are bland...It's just no good.

I feel like I want to rate this game lower, but it is fun in the beginning and it does the PC Civ thing very well.  But I just can't justify the amount of time it takes, and I can't look past its flaws.

Hoo, this one can be unforgiving. Super fiddly, I hate the small round tokens, and the bare bones presentation isn't exactly going to suck anyone in. We persevered and got the hang of it, and it's now turned into one of the most engaging and satisfying games we play (all plays have been 2-player). Our "full" games average 3.5/4 hours of length, but they don't feel like they take that long, which I think says a lot. One of the few games I own that actually had me thinking outside of the game about how I was going to play it the next time.

I like civilization games, and this looks like a solid entry in the genre.

After my first couple of plays I know I enjoy this game, but it's going to take some concentrated effort and multiple games to learn it to the point that I'll feel comfortable rating it.  I do want to play the required games though, so that bodes well for it's score.

After several plays of the full game I find that I really enjoy the game.  Many decisions to be made, and the game constantly keeps you on your feet.  I don't care much for how the conflicts are structured, but I think that I'm not quite grokking them yet.  I know wars and battles are not meant to be the easiest thing to use to your advantage, but so far I have yet to be in a position that I felt confident that I was better off than my opponent by my taking an aggressive action.  The only drawback to this game is that it's taking us around 3 hours to complete a two-player game.  That means we get to play this less often than we'd like!

RATING: 9.5
Obviously inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization (computer game), this conversion to a board/card game works much better than Eagle's earlier attempt. Much more abstract and without a map, this version still has players building and tailoring their "civilization" according to their inclinations and drafting cards that support the direction they wish to take (or sometimes the reverse).

As in so many games lately, the player is regulated by an "action drafting" system where each action involves making choices between many options. The game is essentially one of constructing a victory point engine from the opportunities the game presents.

The game consists of three levels: "simple," "advanced" and "full." The simple game involves very little player interaction and serves mainly to introduce all the moving parts. The advanced game adds more to the game and can involve more player interaction (a lot more if all the optional rules are adopted). The game requires several playings to appreciate the flow and card interactions. With a full four players, the advanced game becomes quite long - the full game would be epic (and since being simply more of the same, I'm not sure the full game will ever need to be played except by fanatics). Three players may be the sweet spot (and I've not tried two players).

The player interaction, when it occurs, consists of taking "military actions" such as playing an "aggression" card which represents a raid or skirmish between two players with the winner being the one with the higher total military strength. In this, the defender has a slight advantage being the only one able to play "defense cards" he may hold. Attacking may mean committing to lose some expensive military units, so doing so (unless almost certain of winning) seems to be a needless gamble. In practice, it means that a player will attack the weakest opponent rather than your nearest competitor and thus tends not to be a particularly useful tool (and a possible design flaw). Nothing would frustrate a player more than investing several hours to his civilization only to see it savaged by an opportunist. So far in our games we haven't seen a lot of this sort of "take that" play - but we can see the possibility of this becoming an important element.

Another related aspect of player interaction is the competition for colonies and new territories where lucrative resources are acquired by bidding military units against the other players. However, as successfully doing so could leave you vulnerable to aggression, it becomes a very calculated risk.

It occurs to me that most players drawn to this game will be those who see this as a Euro version of Civ. The cutthroat nature of the player interaction may prove to be a turn off for many of those. So far I'm liking it (but have yet to see or feel the full force of the nasty things players can inflict on each other).

You have been warned - Caveat Emptor!
++++++
After an extended hiatus, I've had a chance to revisit this game and must admit to the genius of its design. I still think three players is the sweet spot but my hesitance about the military side of the game is proving unfounded. It is integral and self-balancing, and will be visited a lot or a little depending on the group dynamic but the game will stand up either way. Truly impressive!

** Update. Currently flavour of the month, so playing this quite a bit (full game).

Quite like the standard game - yes it's got the combat element cut, but it works and it's pretty short. Advanced game is good, adding in the elements removed from the standard game, especially like the way 'events' are handled.Definitely not 'civilization' or 'civ-lite'. It's a card game with a civilization theme - there's more micromanagement than in civ (more like the computer version with happy people etc). I like the draft mechanic for getting the cards, I like the limited resources and difficult choices and the way each civilization quickly diverges as different cards are picked and different routes to victory selected.I can see downtime being a problem with some with 4 players - but as a 2 player it's great and probably best with 3. Military aspect is interesting - you need some military might, but if you use it then you make yourself weaker and then a target for the 3rd person - so it's not just a case of get ahead and roll over the opponents.

All in all - like it a lot. Main 'missing' bit for me is there's no trading between players - but with the player numbers 2-4 that's not surprising, you need more for a trading game to really shine.

Not sure about balance though - 1st player seems a real disadvantage, and now we all know what we're doing we haven't seen player #1 win in a multiplayer game :( Considering tinkering with start and end game to fix the problem.

I'm very impressed with this game. Very low luck, deep strategy, and possibly the tightest engine builder out there. As powerful as it is unforgiving.

An abstract civilization game.  It's absolute genius.  At its most simple level, you're balancing five different resources (food, minerals, science, military, and VPs), and you can't survive if you fall behind in any one.  Yet it feels like there are so many different paths to victory.  

I will never get rid of this one.

I have very mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand, the mechanisms are original and elegant; on the other hand, they can be a little clunky and engender loops. Sometimes, there's incredibly much to do in the game; at other times, there's nothing to do at all. All in all, I think it's an entertaining and stimulating game which deserves its good reputation, but it's not perfect. Make sure not to play it with AP prone players, though...

I liked it.  It took a little longer than I expected (but it was a 4 player game with 3 newbies) but the theme drew in more than I expected.  Definitely a civ game with tech trees, multiple strategies, etc.  Three more palys and I have yet to win but I'm loving it.

Mar-2015: Waiting on the new release to re-acquire.  One of my two favorite Civ games (Antiquity is the other).  It's very much a card game, but one where the best player normally wins.  Almost all of my plays are online (well over 100) and 2-player which can be brutal.  I can now play an online game in 30 - 45 minutes because it removes all the fiddliness (of which there's a lot).  It's got a lot of card-combination stuff in it so knowing the cards well is important which makes the learning curve steep and long.

Though it plays a little (or lot) on the long side, it is a terrific game! One of Vlaada's best, and that's saying something! At first the amount of little cubes and cards is overwhelming but the game is actually rather intuitive. There isnt much long term strategy though. This game is much more about executing the best tactical option you can to gain the most points. A really great game!

RATING: 10
Rating based on one play of intro game followed immediately by one play of advanced game (4 players).  Wow!  I'm totally blown away.  Before I played, I couldn't see how the components could create a game with enough tension to hold my interest.  They most certainly did, however, and the time flew by.  Expect this rating will probably rise after more plays.  The only thing that didn't thrill us was the fact that most of the event cards made the rich get richer; it would have been nice to have a few more catch-up cards in there.  All said, though, neither game suffered from a runaway leader syndrome.  UPDATE:  Upping rating from an 8.5 to a 9, because after several plays my reaction to finishing one game of Through the Ages is to suggest another, regardless of time.  UPDATE:  And another boost to 9.5.  So frickin' much fun!  UPDATE:  And another boost to 10.  If I have 2-3 hours to spare, I'm in for this game!

I agree with Brian's comments (pwn3d) regarding the military.  It actually seems to me like this was "tacked on".  This exasperates a "leader moves ahead further" problem, which may reflect reality but isn't too good for game play.  The game is well-constructed and simplifies the original/computer game.  However, four hours is still a long game, especially if there's no chance of being competitive after an hour.

Terrific game. TtA somehow manages to capture the epic feel of civ development, featuring multiple ways to win. Despite its shortcomings (length with slow players, randomness of the military deck), it remains one of my very favorites. 4 players is the sweet spot for me. Waiting for the Spanish edition to get a copy.

RATING: 5
Based on one 3 player Advanced Game:

A good civ game that has a story arc that brings one through the times of development of culture and one's little empire. A lot going on in the game. It took 1.25 hours to explain the game and then another 4.25 hours to play. We will play the full game next time.

Three criticisms: firstly, the tie-breaker on event cards was exceptionally lame ("the next player in turn order wins the tie" - it felt like no thought was given on that mechanism). Secondly, it is very lengthy as stated by the game itself. Thirdly, it is very much a multi-player solitaire competition of who builds the better VP engine, so ubiquitously found in the oodles of euros out there.

Update: played a Full Game in under 4.5 hours. Still lengthy. I'm not an admirer of games that require one to know 'the tricks' of which card combos to get; usually leaves me underwhelmed. I don't think of my opponent as being particularly brilliant just because he knew which leader with which building scores the biggest VPs. Also received re-affirmation that this game is virtually all multi-player solitaire with minimal player interaction.

The return on time investment will prevent this one from being played very often.

I liked it, except for the length of it and the micro-management can get a bit aggravating over the turns. The advanced version took us several hours and still felt a little incomplete with age III skipped. I think I would enjoy this the most as a 2 player game, and I wouldn't want to play it with 4, unless maybe if all players are very experienced.

Also, it's an unforgiving game: If you fall behind early, you'll probably stay behind. Especially in such a long game, that can be frustrating.

The mechanics are quite strong, but take far too long to unfold for a game that depends so much on blind card draws.  Basically a deeper version of RftG or San Juan.

A really good civ game. I've always liked the idea of civ-style boardgames but found the long playtime prohibitive. These days I don't have an entire weekend to spare. TTA is a really nice balance between depth of play but with a reasonable playtime. You can knock out a game in 4 or 5 hours. The various mechanics for controlling the growth and development of your civilisation are elegant and devlishly tricky to master. There are numerous routes to victory, so it's not all about who has the biggest stick (Freud eat your hear out). If you haven't tried it then I would heartily recommend you do.

Great design: very intuitive and easy to understand rules, despite their initial complexity. The game plays well with two players, being just competitive enough without being too long. I hate the appearance of the board and the really bad card art. I hope the redesign will have some half-decent art and maybe even a few pictures on the bland scoreboard. As it stands, it seems like a $70 print-and-play.

Nevertheless, it is a fantastic game: there are meaningful decisions galore, and so many possible approaches make the game different every time. For a strictly Civ-themed game, I'll probably always prefer the map-and-mini-based games like Sid Meier's Civilization or Clash of Cultures. As an intense and epic Euro game, however, it's one of the best, highly deserving of its top-five ranking.

UPDATE: Yay!! New edition is both beautiful and more streamlined. Still amazing first edition sold away. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Basic game was boring and solitaire like.  Looking forward to trying the advanced game.  Will re-rate then.

Update: I've played the advanced game.  You build up your own VP engine and get it going to produce VPs.  It's like Race for the Galaxy except not as elegant, the turns take 10x longer, and you can target specific people to hurt their progress.  Not only can you target people, but the opportunity exists to dogpile on people (with person after person attacking the same player on the same turn).  This will not only take the leader down a notch, but knock him out for a good, long time.  And that's if you can even target the leader!  This game actually encourages players to pile on the weakest player, who is probably in the worst position overall.  The mechanics themselves encourage you to team up, putting people in a bad position into a worse one.  If the pile on happens towards the end of the game, there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.

Now this type of military action may be thematic (kind of, I mean, if you're going in after another civ has trashed the place, wouldn't you have to fight the conquering civ for the scraps?), but it kills one aspect: fun.  This was not a fun game.  It's slightly fiddly on top of everything else, and if I didn't have a lunar eclipse to watch between turns, I would probably be rating this game even lower than I already am.

So if you want a longer, less elegant Race for the Galaxy that takes 10x longer... this is your game.

Update:  Thinking about it more, if you want to make this game enjoyable.. go all the way:  Allow players to draft for Military cards instead of a random draw.  Get complete control over your personal civ and cut down on the randomness completely.  That may make the game palatable (and take an extra 2 hours).

Second Update: Knocked it down again for the completely shoddy production and mistakes.  The amount they're charging for this card game is absolutely ridiculous and should not be encouraged by actually buying it.

Third Update: Played a Full Game to make sure my rating isn't crazy.

There are some really uneven cards in the game.  Overall, I enjoyed the two player experience more for two reasons:
 
1) The game seemed quicker, and more enjoyable.
2) The military aspect of the game was one more of brinksmanship than aggressive action.  An aspect I found much better than the multiplayer scenario.
 
That said, there are tons of problems with the game.. most of which I've already explained.. but a lot of uneveness in the cards became glaringly obvious... here's an example:
 
Fast Food Chains:  This card needs a nerf pretty badly.  It's far superior in terms of VPs able to be earned because it falls along natural lines in which you're already building, and it's an easy 30+ vps if you happen to pick it up (which is also part of the randomness of cards coming out, so a huge luck factor).  By comparison, the other Wonders from this age require a specific plan to capitalize upon them, and one you need to be in the path for, while Fast Food Chains provides the most VPs, and it works for everyone.
 
There are other examples, but overall this game just doesn't have the bang for the buck considering time investment, etc.  Race for the Galaxy gives me everything I want in a much shorter timeframe, and has a lot of the same components to gameplay (building your own VP engine, finding ways to maximize around others (actions/card drafts), solo gameplay, and value added from knowledge of the deck.
 
The fact that I was not able to bury any age 3 scoring cards that hurt me simply because I didn't see them is something I would chalk up to bad luck.. but in a 3 hour game, it's largely inexcusable in my eyes.
 
I've raised the rating of Through the Ages to a 4 as a two player experience, which leaves my rating at a 3 overall.  It's just not worth the time investment, and I would probably only play it again in 2p (where military is the only thing that matters)... and then, I'm suggesting anything else over it.

This comment will not be popular with my friends.

I just don't like this game that much.  It's THE FIDDLIEST GAME I have ever played.  I don't think it's a good sign when, an hour into a game, I am just praying (almost literally) that a computer would appear to do all the work.  I know it tries to represent a PC game to begin with, but in my case, I would rather this had been designed as a Civ-lite computer game.

All that said, I respect the design and its depth.  It offers a lot to a gamer (although I am still of the opinion that its nature does not create a true narrative).  I can even see developing your skills at this game becoming a life pursuit.  These are all admirable qualities.

I am just not sure I ever need to play it again.

You know what I would like to see?  The designer of Armageddon Empires should take a shot at developing this into a PC game.  Then, I would get REALLY excited about playing it again.

UPDATE (7/29): Now on BGA!

My rating would be a 9 if this game weren't so damn long. But other than length -- wow. Well balanced game, lots of ingenious mechanisms (future events!), lots to think about every turn. What's really remarkable is how two players can build up completely different civilizations and yet keep up with each other, due to the game's diversity. Downsides: the rules are a total beast (I spent several hours learning them well enough to teach and play the game), there is a [i]lot[/i] of moving bits around (I can only imagine how much easier this would be as a computer game), and, as I said earlier, the undue length. Other than that -- wow. UPDATE: 8 -> 9. Only its length and complexity keep it from a 10. The online implementation is a gift from God.

Played again and increased the rating another notch - this is a very good game indeed.  Now playing online at boardgaming-online.com - which is a fantastic implementation - recommended.

Initially the rules are a bit difficult, but they come together after a turn or three.  An initial partial basic game whetted my appetite, the advanced game didn't dissapoint and the full game is even better (but long).  There are a lot of issues to consider, not least just striking a balance between resources and population, while keeping an eye on the problems caused by corruption and the need to avoid famine and revolt.  And then there's so many tempting options to pursue as the civilisation cards flow past that there are tough choices not only every turn, but every action - even using the Peaceful variant, which is a helpful way to begin but leaves a whole lot more to explore as the military aspects really complete the game, making it both much tougher and more enjoyable.  The only downside is the long playing time but it is worth it and does reduce with experience.  I'm left looking forward to playing again soon.  And then some more.

Comment Cleanup UPDATE:

I have a review here which pretty well summarizes how I feel about the game, so I won't go into excessive detail here. I think Through the Ages is clever in spots, not so clever in others; it's definitely overwrought and has way too much rules grit (a borderline-competent developer could have helped a ton), but has a nice "grand sweep" to it, even if it's not particularly thematic. But it is absolutely *killed* by length and, especially, downtime. This is a totally linear game in which all you can do when it's not your turn is sit around and wait. There is no player interaction to speak of. And that downtime can get extreme, especially late when players have many actions.

This game has a vocal and dedicated fanbase, but personally, I just don't get it. Through the Ages is mediocre at best by most reasonable critical standards. Fans of Sid Meier's Civilization computer game may find some fun here in the evocation of the feel of that game, but folks looking for an actual multi-player boardgame would do well to avoid. This has absolutely nothing on the Avalon Hill classic - it's more complicated, less thematic, more punishing with less control, every bit as long while being far less interactive ... etc.

Excellent game if you don't mind the length, which is the only reason this one doesn't get a 10 rating from me.  The game is a little mind boggling at first (I was taught the full game right off the bat), but begins to make more sense after playing through an age or so.  Really tough to do everything you want to do.  Once the game gets going, it's really cool to see the civs progress from ancient societies to modern cities, and there are many different paths you can follow based on your leader's abilities.  Cool game!  The only drawback for me is that I'd never want to play this game with 4 due to game length and downtime.  Great with three though.

Update: Many years later, Nations has killed this game for me, as I prefer it by quite a bit, and it does almost exactly the same things.

Played almost all of a 3-player full game.  The game is fun, but the length is a real issue for me.  If I can't play it in under 4 hours, I can't play it very often.  It's particularly disconcerting because everything feels so repetitive.  There are a lot of similar cards, and none of us got our production engines going enough to use most of them.

I would also prefer to see a more gradual step up between the ages (maybe 5 ages with smaller increases) and larger decks of cards from which the combinations are drawn randomly for each game.  I already have a favorite leader and wonder in Antiquity.  If I played more often, I could probably also develop set strategies for other ages.  That really takes away a lot of the fun.  

I love all the bit fiddling.  I like the idea of this game alot.  I like a lot of the execution.  But something just missed the mark.  I really don't think it's a game for me to own.  I'm more than happy to play it once in a while, however.  

The rating is preliminary, and could change with more plays.

[20/03/2007] Having only played the first two ages, I haven't by any means gained a firm opinion regarding TtA. Many question-marks remain for the time-being:

Direct player interaction in TtA - lacking a trading element found in many other Civilization-style games - is limited to military affairs. Since that part of the game is rather toned down in its importance, direct player interaction is pretty low. This is particularly true if the arms race remains relatively balanced and attacks are sufficiently deterred.

This means player interaction is more indirect in nature (a feature common to many eurogames). Such as in regards to card drafting. Unless I underestimate the importance and frequency of military confrontation, I'd say TtA has only low player interaction and approaches the "multiplayer solitaire" character of say Princes of Florence or Goa.

The question then is whether managing your own civilization holds sufficient interest as to compensate for the lack of player interaction.

Creating and maintaining a balanced and productive economy does offer an interesting challenge. So does judicious card drafting and play. But is this solitaire-esque puzzle sufficiently engaging for the pretty long time it takes to play TtA? As far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out on that vital question.

My tolerance of "solitaire puzzles" in games tends to diminish the longer it takes to play a game. A high degree of player interaction is what keeps
me engaged in say a 'Britannia' or 'Twilight Imperium', while a "solitaire puzzle" may easily get stale and repetitive of the course of hours.

I think the key to keeping the managing one's empire exciting is for different problems to emerge in each age. A true story arc. My very limited experience suggests that the various ages only provide more powerful cards, rather than altering the underlying economic dynamics(e.g. ages creating different scarceties). I am interested to see whether further play of mine will confirm or refute this suspicion of mine.

"Free-form" multiplayer games tend to struggle with the "runaway leader" and "leader bashing" issues. The right balance between rewards for successful/aggressive play and opportunities to reverse the game situation needs to be found. The greater direct player interaction (often manifesting itself militarily) happens to be, the more opportunity for the latter there tends to be. I'm concerned that the relatively marginal role of military affairs in TtA isn't compensated by a further area of direct interaction. So reigning in the leaders and catching up might be overly difficult (rich get richer problem raising its ugly head).

I fear the game may well see too many situations in which the trailing players have no chance whatsoever to win and the outcome of the game will already be in no doubt well before the game draws to a close. Such anticlimactic endings are particularly problematic with long games, since the endgame's then correspondingly longer.

So, I do find myself rather in doubt whether TtA suits my taste. I will need to play it again to gain a proper impression regarding the said dynamics in this game. The overarching question's whether the game has a true story arc which makes the various ages truly different and hence engaging so as to compensate for the low player interaction (and possible downtime symptoms) arising from this.

Despite my rather skeptical first impressions, I'm quite eager to study this game more since it's thematically in many respects an original and clever design. Certainly solid craftsmanship.

What a stark contrast to the horribly flawed and loathesome "Sid Meier's Civilization - The Boardgame" by Eaglegames our gaming group recently brought to the table.

I wonder whether TtA can win a place in my affection next to "Mare Nostrum", the game in the Civilization genre I most favour (provided one uses the general naval blockade variant rule and a couple of other tweaks, mind you).

I owned this game for a year and a half before trying it because the rule book is awful. But I found the How to Play podcast on it, and I finally took the plunge- played it once in cardboard form, and haven't stopped playing it since both in cardboard form and on boadgamearena.com. I think that this game has the most depth of any I have played, and it is so much fun trying out different strategies every time you play the game. Vlaada is a beast. Haven't tried a game of his I haven't adored yet.

Really enjoy the burn on this one. Still, I have a couple of concerns:

1. Length. Does it offer enough control to make it worth the investment? 

2. Still feels like a bit of a point-churner Euro rather than a Civbuiler. 

3. Does the wrong card flop imbalance the game (i.e.,are certain cards overpowered?). 

Liking it a lot. If we can play it in less than 3 hours (maybe cut down to advanced game?) I could see the rating rising. 

UPDATE: Nah, I think that it is just too generic and long to really be much fun for me. While the card names and drawings give sort of gave me the impression that TtA is a Civ-builder with some history built in, it's really just a cube-pusher , and a cube-pusher with too much luck of the draw. With more than two players the group could maybe gang up on the guy with killer card, but egad, I can't imagine how long a three or four player game would take. 

Still, the game is well-designed, and I admire what the designer was trying to accomplish, but it is just not for me. Another much-hyped game disappoints.

Based on 1 play with 2 players (Simple game): Once again, I'm rating this lower than it should be due to my extreme desire to avoid long games. I've really learned my lesson after buying this... no more long games! Anyway, there's some good stuff to say about this game. Despite the length, the actual turns moved at a nice pace and while the rulebook was daunting at first things felt streamlined once we got going. I'm SURE this would change if I were playing the advanced game... but the simple game just felt like any standard point accumulation/VP machine game and NOT a civ building game. Methinks it's time to trade this.

Solid game that for me somewhat overstayed its welcome around 3 hours into the 4.5 hour 4-player advanced game. The actions are somewhat repetitive and the downtime with 4 is excessive, particularly late in the game when players have acquired more actions and options. Also, while the game requires you to keep up with the other players, for military actions and end-game scoring, there isn't much interaction. That said, the game is fun, the theme is of course terrific, and the mechanics are simple/solid. 
I think for me, this will fit into the 3 player advanced game only niche.

[u]May 2009: [/u] Just bought this, I'm really excited to try it out, though I'm a bit scared that it won't be great for 2p and that it might be too long... We'll see.

1st game, 2p, simple game: the simple game is not good, it is pretty much uninteresting but it does help to get a grasp on a good part of the concepts. Play one of these but just once...

2nd game: 2p, advanced: The advanced game is significantly better (and longer). It took 3 hours. It was a good 3 hours though, even if I did feel kind of left with my mouth hanging wanting for more at the end. I didn't have that feeling of accomplishment near the end that I like in civ games. The game could be shorten I guess once we know the cards better and when we're both not tired.

[u] June 2009:[/u] Ok, 2 full games: this is GREAT!!

I just love the game, the cold war arms race style works great and brings a lot of tension. The events bring nice interaction.

Don't play the simple game, it sucks. But play it once to get the hang of it. Then play the advanced game once but that's it. The advanced game is too short and you can basically (I feel) forget all about military which is where the game really shines.

The full game is the real game, the other 2 variants are just to be considered as tutorials. Don't buy this game thinking you'll have a short game playing the advanced or shrt games, these are not that good. But if you're not afraid of a 2h30+ game, I can only recommend this.

[u]January 10:[/u] 20+ plays, I stand by my judgment, the full game is GREAT! There are still tons of stuff I haven't tried out and am anxious to do so. I wrote a review [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/474645/no-map-so-what]here[/url]

RATING: 6
I finally got to play Through the Ages ‚Äì this was probably the game I was anticipating the most to get on the table! I loooved the Civilization computer games, and in general like civ games, so my expectations for this game were extremely high! However, even though it was a very good game, my first play didn‚Äôt convince me that it was such a good game I had hoped it would be. Mind you, I did like it very much, and I do think it was almost impossible for the game to live up to my expectations. But I did not think I would only rate it a 7.5‚Ä¶ The main reason for this rating is this: time consumption! The game takes 3¬Ω-4¬Ω hours, and that‚Äôs too much for me considering the enjoyment I get out of the game. I could play 2-3 other great eurogames in that time span!

There are other reasons for my somewhat low rating. The two biggest reasons, besides the length, are the fiddlyness and especially the emphasis on military which seems too important to neglect. 
To elaborate on the first one, all of the little round discs are hard to pick up, and you constantly need to move them back and forth! There is a lot of upkeep you need to watch your step tread carefully in order to avoid mistakes. While the fiddlyness was a little annoying, it wasn‚Äôt part of the gameplay. What is, is the importance of military, and that was definitely what I disliked the most.

I was told that military was important, but not THIS important! If your opponent(s) start building military units, you simply have to follow, because if you don‚Äôt you are going to get smashed! And the need to build an army is a shame I think‚Ä¶ But I guess that without the military aspect, the game would be too much multiplayer solitaire. Furthermore it felt a little odd that military isn‚Äôt really that important in the last round (unless a war has been declared earlier etc). Regarding war, military strength is even more important as you cannot use defense cards! In my second game I won by 70 points, and I probably got half of them due to a couple of wars‚Ä¶
Furhermore, the game is highly strategic but also features a lot of tactical elements (as the card row, which was fantastic!), and I think the random card draws spoil this mechanic somewhat, especially as you can draw a lot of useless military cards.

After my ramblings about my issues with the game, I need to talk about the good stuff! It‚Äôs awesome to control your own little civilization! The management concerning feeding your population, keeping track of corruption, planning your actions and keep a balance between military, culture and science is brainburning but fantastic! While your race isn‚Äôt unique at the start of the game, it quickly turns into one. The wonders and Leaders work very well too and are a big part of why your civilization feels unique. I have my favorites among them, and there are also some cards I would certainly not buy, but again, it‚Äôs situational and I‚Äôm sure they are balanced. I was pleasantly surprised that a civilization game like this actually works without a map, which was one of my biggest concerns. Finally, the bonus cards you reveal after the game add tension as there are some final hidden bonus scoring cards which can shake things up!

After considering the good thing and the bad things, I cannot give it a better rating. It‚Äôs a good game, but 1¬Ω hour per player is too much and is the reason that it‚Äôs not a game I always want to play. As said, I can play 2 or perhaps even 3 very good eurogames in the same time. It‚Äôs a shame, and while I don‚Äôt mind the occasional long game, I have come to the conclusion that I prefer my games to last less than 3 hours. 
I dived right into the full game with 2 other, very experienced players. I managed okay and was actually close to winning, which I was surprised to see considering all of the mistakes and sub-optimal decisions I made. My second play was against another inexperienced player, and once again the military played a decisive factor. I am eager to play the game again, but if it continues to have these ‚Äúproblems‚Äù (length, fiddlyness and importance of military), I‚Äôm not really sure what to do. Anyway, my next play will probably be against my wife, and I‚Äôm going to play it with the rules without military and see what happens. And after that I am going to try the advanced game again a few more times before I make up my final conclusion. I can‚Äôt wait, because I love the idea of this game and I want to love the gameplay too!

The cards reminded me of the Sid Meier's Civilization (the PC game) which was a personal favourite for many years. I disliked the abstract feeling of having no map and just moving pieces around like an accountant. The small round population and resource counters were extremely annoying to handle. With four players this was a very long and unrewarding experience with minimal interaction and only two changes of position in 6 hours (2nd and 3rd swapped positions and then swapped back) and we still hadn't finished. Never again!

Forget the debates about component quality and errors. Just buy the game and enjoy it - its fantastic.

I bought the Third Edition with little hope of playing it except maybe solitaire. My gaming at the moment is mainly with family.
I managed to persuade my wife to give it a try 2 player and we haven't looked back. We have now played 12 games and she actually asks to play again - unheard of!

In fact last night we finished a game and I was about to pack it away and I heard the words - "let's leave it on the table, it's not worth putting it away". I think I'm in a dream!

I'm not sure I'd play with 4 because of the downtime but I might try with three if I pick a member of the family who is into games.

Love the gameplay with all player counts, and I discovered Tom's Solo Variant, which I really Enjoy. It's difficult to get this game to the table because of how deep the game is and how long it plays. Must have a consistent group who knows how to play or it can be overwhelming and very long. New players are likely to get a good beating. That said, the game is just really good and has so much replay value I have to give it a 10. I am always thinking of choices I made and what I could do different, and every game you have to come up with a different strategy. Such a great civilization game, and it has no map! The solo variant let's me play when I want and I can have a smooth fun game. I also invested in some larger pieces for the boards. The pieces the game comes with are extremely small.

I am only going to give this game a 9.5 at this time because I have only played the Simple Game.  Chances are, it will increase with the full rules implemented, but for now, it is slightly incomplete.

This is definitely a thinkers game, with a significant amount of strategy.  A very well done job by the designer, and after playing the Simple Game, it begs to be played again with the Advanced and Full Rules.  The rules can be daunting at first, but like other highly-rated strategy games ([gameid=3076], [gameid=18602], [gameid=2651]), they can be overcome if one sets their mind to it.  An excellent job.

Oh, and if you have played any of the later iterations of Sid Meyers' Civilization PC-based games, you will find a few things (somewhat) familiar.  However, unlike the computer game, having the most CULTURE is really the victory condition.  This is definitely a game that will see a significant amount of play.

Feels like a very long Euro - as most of the game is resource manipulation where you want to do 10 things but can only do 2.  You try to make strategic plans to get certain upgrades in play only to find out that those plans need to be re-adjusted because even better upgrades come along that you now need to plan for - and in a nutshell - that sums up all the interesting decisions you make in the game.  The theme is well integreted into the card choices and even though there is a military aspect to the game, this is by no means anything close to a wargame.  The military is just another resource you need to manage, along with food, material, population, science, victory points and overall happiness.  Recommended if you can find the time to play through at least the second age and with at least 3 players.

It would probably take too long to play.

Wow it really took too long to play.  We played with four players, using the advanced (but not full) rule set.  One person had played before, the other three had not, but were all experienced gamers.  The game is not particularly engaging to look at unfortunately, and everyone else's turn is pretty boring.  There isn't anything to do while someone else is taking their turn, and there's not much reason to pay attention either because mostly they can't affect you.

Although you could be planning your turn while you wait, the burning and shifting cards are sufficient change that you'll likely have to re-assess when you get to act.

I think with repeated plays speed could be improved, but it remains that the game isn't very engaging to look at.  Also some interest in other players may be provided with the FULL rules, including pacts and wars, but I don't know if it was good enough on the first play through to draw us back to try that.

Less players has also been recommended, and I think 2p may be where this game shines... more at least.

07/10/12: One play so far simple game.  I like it and I cannot wait to try the advance game.  Flow quite smoothly and clean design.

21/10/12: 4p advanced game.  Yep 4p takes a while (3 and a half hours).  But it is fairly engaging and it's a semi learning game for half of us.  Can probably cut down gametime in the future.

Enjoyable game.

Oh look!  Another eurogame where you can be winning by a mile, but if you don't know the text of a few cards that get played right at the end of the game, you're screwed!

Asinine, cynical, deterministic, over-priced and unnecessary eurogame implementation of the civ genre.  Just right for those of us who cannot wrap their puny brains around anything that doesn't have little wooden cubes.  Underwhelming production values.

Through the Ages is an odd beast of a game. I both admire it and conclude that it has some traits about it that are off-putting. It's a game that I tried, enjoyed, traded for, hated, traded away, played online, and now grudgingly admire.

First off, it's an admirable design that provides players with a broad playground for teching up a civilization. It's a demanding balancing act that forces players to juggle, resources, happiness, military, science, and ultimately culture for the win. I imagine every time I play this game I'll learn something new.

And, the game is also fiddly, with a player's turn taking quite some time. It's long. And most disconcerting, it's incredibly unforgiving for inexperienced players. I don't think anyone can prepare a new person sitting at the table with experienced TTA players for the arse-whipping they are about to get handed. Military does incentivise players to beat on the weak, and there's a reason that "Leaving the Game Honorably" is written in the rules.

Now that I have a few plays under my belt, I think ultimately I will enjoy playing this game online most with a core group of people. It's certainly not a game I need to own, but it is a game I enjoy very much via the slowburn of online play.

Once making a mistake during the game; it is hard to setting up check point for re-do the process.  Also the playing time seems to be to long for the advanced game.
I think that if you have a consistent game group and you are willing to spend 3-4 hours at a time playing one game, this will definitely be a hit. For new players, if you are unsure about playing this game often in the future, it may not be the best choice. Not that it is difficult to learn, but more so because it is not worth the initial investment unless you know you can play this game again and become better at it. This game is best when all players know what to expect in terms of time, skill and complexity. If one or more players is not really into the game and just selecting actions on a whim, the game could fall flat. There are so many things to keep track of and so many decisions to make, that the level of enjoyment really depends on how the players participate.

2 plays with 3 players

Love it my first play, hated it my second.  In the end it is a good economic engine game, that takes a long time to play but in which I felt I never had the time to develop my civ.  Technology cards race across the board before you can "buy" them - what does that model historically?  There's no map to explore which is a HUGE minus in my book, and there's no tech tree.  If my people have developed printing presses, why can't they develop journalism?

The game is rife with niggley little rules that make no sense given the theme and obey no logic ... making them hard to remember and internalize into one's play.

It's a good game, a 6 that takes way to long to play and seems to either fly by or drag endlessly depending, in no small part, on how lucky you are.

I doubt I would ever play again - other titles do the Civ building thing better.

The production quality (FRED 1st edition) is horrific, North Korean level stuff.

This is a lengthy civilization building game, but it's very immersive.  It's impossible to have a short "civ" game that has this kind of theme - either it's longer, or it's not very "civ".  This is a very enjoyable game, though, a rewarding experience that merits repeat plays.

The No. 1 game in my collection. A deeply engrossing game of building your own empire whilst keeping your opponents in check - be it with a superior culture/VP engine or military might.

:tobacco: :( :D :D :D I don't think I've ever had a game go from zero to ten plays this quickly (thanks largely to boardgaming-online.com; may their tribe increase), and I'm still ready to play again, in fact I just launched two online games as of this writing.

TTA is, at heart, an engine-building efficency Euro where players (civilizations) have a variable number of action points based (primarily) on their system of government. Variables that must be managed are food (for adding much-needed population), resources (for building just about everything), science (for discovering just about everything), military strength (used to crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentation of their women, or to defend yourself from same) and culture (aka victory points). Like Dominion/Agricola/Le Havre/Puerto Rico/Race For The Galaxy/etc., the early game is all about setting up the engine to churn out everything except VPs, and the grand-strategic decision point is when to pivot to start building the big point generators. Too much early point scoring is a drag against your endgame, pivoting too late leaves you horribly behind. The equivalent of Agricola's "feed your family" mechanic is the arms race, which really does end up being an arms race in a game-theoretic sense -- military (depending on your opponent's approach) is either your key to victory, your total undoing, or a persistent annoying (but necessary) drag on the health of your economy.

TTA is a bit long but once you get used to the end-turn fiddling (it helps A LOT to do everything in the same order every time) it's not oppressively long. And it actually handles the book-keeping quite elegantly, considering. [i]And[/i] it's in that rarefied category of games that are both good for two and good for three and four.

A worthy choice as a main-course game for any lover of heavier Euros, and an addictive temptation as an asynch online game. Play this thing.

Too tactical for length.

Okay.  I hate TtA.  It's too reliant on tactical efficiency optimization.  I can't implement a strategy because there's no guarantee that I can get the necessary cards.  

I was trying to use a military strategy, which gets around the reliance on civil action card somewhat, but then often  I don't draw military cards I need.

On top of all that, the third era cards can be incredibly swingy but there's no way of knowing which ones will come in to play to optimize for from the beginning.

So the best strategy seems to be do a little of everything, and hope for the best.  Bleh.

Plus engine building just doesn't interest me.  I wanted to see if I could avoid engine building successfully, and it seems to work 40% of the time, but it's such a narrow path that now that I've fine-tuned it I see no use of playing the same way every game.

This is really starting to grow on us, and we've only ever done the advanced versions once.  Every other time, we've been teaching the game.

We've just replayed the advanced version and we really botched it hard.  We'll have to try again before teaching that version.

Due to the nature of the full game, when you have an engine that you think is weak, the end of the game can really drag.  For the last couple turns, you'll want it to end but not bow out (even though it is in the rules that you can).

After many many plays, I've come to feel that this game is fantastic in so many ways.  The fact that every game feels like a great combination of different decisions never gets old.  I simply never see myself getting tired of it.  It perfectly captures the civilization concept without the now-obviously-unnecessary added complexity of a world map, which I think is one of the greatest points in its favor.

I can't get enough of this game.

Two 'simple' games played so far, neither to a conclusion. Very enjoyable and I hope it gets played a lot more. The theme and mechanics are right up my street.

UPDATE: Finally finished a simple game and it's every bit as good as I expected. Looking forward to moving on to some of the more advanced mechanics.

UPDATE 2.0: Decided to sell this on because Holly didn't like it, and given the nature of the way the game is learnt I figured it probably wouldn't hit the table for four players either. A huge shame, but it did fund the purchase of Robinson Crusoe. Every cloud...

Having said that I would like to buy it again one day.

Much too long and fiddly for what you get.  I might enjoy it more in one sitting, but I don't have an entire open day to sit and play.  Still need to figure out some of the exceptions, frustrated by the heaps of ambiguity, constant confusion, fiddliness, and it is very time consuming.  It's actually kinda fun when you get into it, kinda, but just isn't worth the time commitment.

Willing to give it another shot, but interest is dwindling.

-easily the most convoluted combat system i've played
-rewards ganging up on the guy in last place who is rewarded with 4+ hours of a joyless slog
-feels like tedious busy work - a bit like managing your email inbox or physical junk mail

This game has a unique approach to empire building and economy that involves managing different streams of your economy (agriculture, production, science, government, military). I find this game very involved and exciting even though it takes about 4 hours to play.

I've only played the simple game so far and I'm a little disappointed.  Hopefully the game will get better the next few plays.  Call it a 7

I played again and again and again, I really enjoyed it.  There seems to be some imbalance in at least one of the early leaders when playing the simple game.  Not a big deal as I've moved onto the full game and balance issues seem to average out.  An 8.

Now that I've played it a few times with the full game I'm really enjoying it.  I really like deep games, they don't necessarily need to be complex but games with lots of strategy at the least and if there are multiple paths to victory that's all the better.  Through the Ages really scratches my itches.  The only negative I have with the game is that it's a little fiddly and a long.  Still a great game though.  Very fun a 9 in my book.

3/25/08  I've played a number of full games and I really like this game, my only gripe is it's too long.  I've downgraded it from a 9 to a 8 primarily because of length.

5/20/08 Changed to a 7.  Unfortuantely the game has too much downtime.  I still like it, but not as much as when it first came out.

6/2/08 Changed back to an 8 based on it's strength as a 2 player game!  No downtime, very interesting, civ building, win!  

9/23/08 And back to a 7.  Just seems very fiddly, still a very good game.

02/08/09 And back to an 8, 3 player isn't so bad when everyone plays quickly.
02/27/09 2 Player game is great, 8.5.

Wow, the more I play...the more I want to play this beauty. Is it the perfect game? No.  But its thoroughly engaging and is the most satisfying civilization game I've ever played.

The production values are disappointing. I recall noticing that when I opened the box. But as soon as I started the first game, that became irrelevant. The components are adequate to play, and the design and game itself are impressive. Its nice to see an undertaking like this which has been well developed and adequately play-tested. I don't see enough people giving credit there, when it would be easy to imagine discovering that a card or card combo was ambiguous or over-powered. I'm finding no such issues.

Its loooong to play the full game, but its really the only way to go if there's the option. Things just barely started happening in the advanced game when it was at the end. The added manipulation of playing secret scoring events adds just the right bit of caginess.

Initially, I had some concerns over how well the military interactions would work. In time, I came to realize that they are the genius that makes the rest of the game work. You really can't do everything. If you invest too heavily in infrastructure, you'll be militarily susceptible. And if that's the case: your infrastructure will eventually take a hit. There are multiple ways to interact with your opponents. If the aggression/war options weren't there, there might be no viable way to reel in the leader at times. That said, it can sometimes be pretty hard to gauge who the leader is. 

Finally, the game works well and feels different with each different number of players (2-4). I guess the biggest downside is that waiting for your turn in a 4p game can be a bit slow. But the pace feels OK in 3p games. I don't usually play multiplayer games 2p, but this is one that really works. It feels to me like a CDG, like Twilight Struggle. There is some deck management and racing to optimize. But you can get at your opponent in more ways than he/she can defend. And vice versa!

My rating only rises. Maybe it will settle in at a 10 for me. Its pretty darn close.

Update: After about a dozen plays (all full games) I'm starting to feel that the military race supercedes most other strategy. The player who is ahead there most of the game tends to always win. Our local games have turned into a giant race for military strength, with lower overall scores.

8 after the Simple game. not going to fully judge it on that iteration since it is a very "bland" VP machine/book keeping set of rules (but still gives a hint of the complexity and manifold options). hoping the Advanced and Full games are much more thought provoking in strategy/down time and more social in inter-player action.

I found the game to be overly fiddly and way too much downtime during my learning session, but afterwards I really couldn't stop thinking about it. Very anxious to play again.

*update* played a lot now. Excellent game, only weakness is complete randomness in military draw. Can make military strategy both useless and overpowered. Wish I could think of a way to fix that problem, if I could this would be a 10.

RATING: 8
I assume that most people reading this have some idea of what this game is about, but here's the quick:

TtA is a civilization themed game where the players draft personalities, technology, wonders, and so forth from a central display, occasionally kick the crap out of each other with military strength, and generally build large scale economic engines. The entire thing is one big economic game in essence, where you need to get resource x, convert that into y, and then turn that into z. Everything is tight in the game, and you always need more of something. The game is quite comparable, in terms of fiddle, to the Civ computer games, which are nodded to directly in the form of a Sid Meier leader card.

So you build a snowball, which you then use to make a bigger snowball. You MUST keep up with the technology curve in the farming, agriculture, science, and culture areas, or you will find yourself in very dire straits. The game essentially amounts to juggling 14 balls at once.

Now, I like the game, and I found it enjoyable to play. We went straight to the Full game, which goes through all 3 ages, and has all of the rules present, and I really couldn't see playing this game any other way. That said, the game is long with that many cards, and I really prefer to play it with either 2 or 3 rather than 4 simply because the pace is faster...TtA is one of those games where each player takes their entire turn while the others wait, so each player adds about an equal amount of downtime (because you can't plan ahead well, the card display turns for each turn, and it often dictates what you want to do...). All of this said, with 4 relatively fast players who know the game it's easily doable in 2.5-3 hours, which I think is fine for this title. If your group isn't pretty fast and experienced, then 3 really has to be the cap here.

Frankly, after having played it with 2, I feel that it is best at that scale. The downtime is almost non-existent, and the game keeps the engine-building feel that I like it for without bogging down unnecessarily. I don't actively dislike it with more, and I don't mind playing it with 3, but the 2 player game is probably my favourite way to pull this out. In the two player game, the card draft gains more texture (i.e.: you can actually leave stuff behind with the intent of picking it up cheaper later) and the "problem" of the weak player being beat on by multiple people (which I have not personally witnessed, nor think should be a problem given competent play) doesn't exist. With 2 the only thing you lose is a touch of combat flavour, and the occasional pact. What you get in trade is a fast-moving game where your turn comes back in short order and the engine-building heart of the game remains beating, but more steadily.

I like this game, it's easily the most grand engine building game that has come down the pike in recent years, and the theme is outstanding given Euro conventions and the cards all seem to work in thematic ways, particularly Bill Gates. To me, the criteria for good theme is that the game mechanics must seem to flow naturally given the veneer that has been pasted onto them, and TtA succeeds on that count with flying colours. This is not the type of game that is going to come out every week, but I'm glad to have it around for special occasions. 

This is one of the few games where the rating has to be a sort of average: probably a 9 for 2 players, one of my favourite games at that scale. Perhaps a 8 at 3 players, and a 7 or lower with 4 players depending on their speed of play (i.e.: me with 3 newbies would be something like a 2, me with 1 newbie and 2 other experienced players, maybe a 6, knowledgeable group of 4, easily a 7-8). I rate it an 8 because it frankly deserves recognition for being an excellent design that I often enjoy playing, but it does have to fit into a reasonable time frame and even one slow player can easily add an extra hour to the game.

Notes on the editions: The 1st edition (Czech) printing is superior in almost every way to the 2nd from FRED. The card stock in the first edition is better, the board configuration is superior, and it also has 3 Age III leaders who had to be removed for copyright purposes when the game was reprinted (Bill Gates, Elvis, Sid Meier). The 2nd edition is still worth owning, but I highly advise at least producing paste-ups for the missing leaders. The 3rd edition cards from FRED are reputedly much better, though paste-ups are still recommended for the missing leaders, and I still prefer the original board config.

RATING: 9.5
This is the best civilisation game I've played. It lacks the one of the 4X elements (no map to explore) but more than makes up for that in doing the other three Xs very well indeed.  

Does require some effort to learn but most of the rules are intuitive and the consequences of your action are usually clear.

This is a rather good 2 player game something I never expected. Despite its lengthy play time this game just floats my boat.

2013
The economy in the game never really explodes exponentially, even if you playing well the lack of one of the following: materials, food, workers or research will put a break on progress. So I'm comming to the conclusion, that if you are seeing rapid improvement, your playing wrong.  Last night we forgot to take away the food costs for a large work force at the end of the turn. Consequently one of the breaks on the economy was removed and progress was rapid.  We should have seen the clues but I foolishly thought it signified an improvement in our gameplay.  The subtle interaction between the different elements of the game shine through.

When we spotted the issue I suggested that we from then on implement the rule.  This was not a good idea it broke my opponents economy two turns before the end of the game and that in retrospect was unfair.  He had no time to mitigate the lack of food and stagnation set in.  I was insulated from this issue by a stock pile of unallocated workers because I had invested in a small improvement in food production a few turns earlier.

I was so focused (this game causes this kind of excitment sometimes) on the main part of my turn that I forgot the political part of the game sequence.  I only played one event in Era II despite a handful of relevant cards (lost the culture score but this may not have otherwise been an advantage).  I also forgot to implement the power of my period one leader (still being used) for a chunk of period II with an additional loss of culture.

I think we were not making quite as many mistakes in Power Grid after 10 plays.  Some of the games subsystems are easy to overlook and there is more to keep an eye on.

2014
I am now playing this game on Boardgame Arena where I have learnt the importance of a stong military the hard way (in period three I was systematically demolished in the first three games).   Despite getting involed in approximately 25 games simultaneously this game shows no sign of losing its shine. I will at some point scale this commitment back if only to improve my play (for instance last night I made several decissions in haste and have blown my chances in a few games) and spend more time studying good opponents.

This game could have be designed for a turned based online format and losses its all night monster status.  The fiddly and easliy forgotten maintenance is gone and now have to learn to slow down, watch my oponents more closely and move away from tactical cosiderations and form long term strategies.

After 127 plays I will be resting this game for a while.

Si nota anche l'ottimo lavoro svolto per bilanciare tutti gli aspetti produzione/tecnologie/militare . In sostanza un grande gioco , oserei dire geniale . Faccio i complimenti all'ideatore e a tutti i suoi collaboratori .

Holy moly.  This is the real deal, folks, not some stinking area control exercise with a supposed civilization theme haphazardly draped over it.  Through The Ages is a complex, detailed game that thoroughly provides the sense of development, progression, and strategic variety that anything claiming to be "Civ-Lite" routinely seems to miss.  I have to admit that I was quite skeptical about something initially described as a "Civilization card game" but after a couple of plays it's clear that Mr. Chvatli knew exactly what to cut away and what simply had to remain- the result is a modern game aware of Euro innovations but steeped in the detail and theme-rich traditions of American games and the PC games of Sid Meier.  The card drafting mechanic seemed at first blush to resemble St. Petersburg (which could have been a disaster) but it turns out to be a really interesting way of moving the game along and forcing tough decision points at times when the last thing you need is another option.  Speaking of which, there are tons of branches on this decision tree and you'll never feel that unfortunate sense of having only one or two choices to make per turn.  I was also unsure of how a style of game that really requires a geographical element would work but the way conflict and territory is handled in a somewhat abstracted way works very well- I particularly like how wars are fought with specific goals in mind and aggression is handled in the old Dune manner- how many people are you willing to lose to win?  As far as length goes, the game should be completely playable in 3-4 hours with a full table of 4 folks who've played at least once and I think the 2 and 3 player options should be almost as good as a full table and shorter.  Downtime?  Some, but if you're engaged in the game and have an idea of what you're doing when your turn comes around it's no more than in any other game of this scope.  In my games I've been pretty amazed at the epic feel the game imparts in a relatively short amount of time.  I do think the production, although serviceable, is a little spartan (I hate those tiny glass beads) but the translations- in particular the rulebook- are flawless and complete.  Vlaada Chvatil has found himself a place on my "hot" list, I loved PROPHECY as well and I think GRAENALAND looks interesting too- definitely a designer that has a great sense of combining rich theme with modern mechanics.  Replayability is probably the only thing keeping me from a 10 rating- I _feel_ like it has legs thanks to meaningful interaction and variability but if certain strategies and pathways emerge that render the variety of choices meaningless then it could suffer.  A great design regardless- a fun game that could very well last...Through the Ages!

Played a few simple and advanced games before doing up a couple full games.  Cool efficiency engine game.  Wish we could get a two player game done in 2.5 hours instead of 4 though.

Edit - after about ten plays this shit still takes four hours to push out. 

Nov 2012 - three hours finally. 

Dec 2012 - under two and a half hours (2 player)

I got to play this at BGG con. In a 4 player game we spent 8 hours and played the game to the end of the 2nd age. You can play to the end of the 1st 2nd or 3rd age. This was our first game and we would be faster especially with fewer players. The game is all its cracked up to be. I will certainly be getting it but will it ever get played thats another question. I've heard of 2 people finishing in 4 hours so it can be done and even with 2 people it would still be a good game. However I thought the player interaction is somewhat limited. This is very much a engine game. Possibly the most fascinating engine game out there. If you are prepared to spend the time then you'll love it. I should mention the time is not really related to it being overly complex. All the pieces fit nicely together and it works great, there are just a ton of things you can and need to do. Traded for Civilization.

I just got this for Christmas, and I love this game.

A great Civ building game that plays really well with 2.

Update: 12/30/2010 - I upped the rating to a 10 from 9. This game has so much going on with it, and almost every turn is painful because I NEED to do so much, and WANT to do a lot of other things. The decisions are delicious!

I have played with 2 and 3 and both are excellent!

Update: 4/11/2012 - I lowered this rating to an 8. It is still a great game, but has been reduced to the same game every time. After 100 plays, I am seeing that military is the strongest strategy in the mode I play the most, 2 players.

Doesn't really excite me like it does a lot of other people.  I don't find myself seeking to play this game.  I never really get a feeling of "building a civilization".  

Obviously play would speed up as I (and opponents) would get more familiar with the cards, but I always find myself wanting to play something else (or a few things, in the time it takes to play this game).

RATING: 9
Through the Ages is my favorite board game. It's a complex, resource-management game in which you build civilizations with resources. The game is card-driven rather than dealing with some big map. It never plays the same way twice and is exciting and always challenging. 

I can't rate it a 10 because it does have flaws. Namely, two-player games can get out of hand militarily,three-player games enhance the kingmaker effect and four-player games have a random distribution of points due to end-of-game impact cards. And when played live, the game is very mechanical. Like Vegas Showdown, this game is played much better online, where the computer gives you vital information (i.e. notifying you when you're in corruption) and performs the mechanics for you. 

Sure enough, there is a FANTASTIC website http://wwww.boardgaming-online.com in which you can play the game online. I have been satisfied with the game enough that I have yet to play the version of the game at http://www.boardgamearena.com

Fiddly - a lot of keeping track of things - more work than fun! Unfortunately it's still the best [u]Civilization[/u] boardgame up-to-date. High complexity, depth and replayability, although unbalanced. Too long gameplay but customizable, multiple variants of playing (most of times we play the Advanced & Peaceful variant). Many rules to remember. The wooden components are too small for my taste.
We play 2 player games with "open cards in hand" (face-up near the board).

Good solid game. Needs more plays to make a full assessment. First impression was that as civ games go, I still prefer Clash of Cultures. In Clash of Cultures everyone starts the same and has to choose a path (usually a specific tech specialisation) for victory. And you get to use warrior units on a map. 

Through the Ages has a more random element to its gameplay in that the timing of the cards will dictate your strategy. So even if you would have liked to go a particular strategy, the cards may not let you. Random events can also screw you without much ability to control them. In that sense my preference is for Clash of Cultures. Nevertheless, this is still a solid game.

2nd play vs. Chris and William.  I really do like this game, but I have yet to play well and with the correct rules all the way.  I hope to get in another play soon as the rules are still fresh in my mind.  This is a good game, and having only played 2 3-player games, and reading the comments on 4-player games, I will never attempt one.  This is a good game, but I don't wan to play it for 6 or 7 hours.


1 play vs. Todd and James.  I quite enjoyed this game.  We messed up a few rules, but overall the game experience was good.  The upgraded mines and farms are far more rare than we thought (almost too much?).  I am not sure about the last turn in which you do all events that are left in the event deck.  It just seems "messy" to end the game that way.

The Twilight Impirium of Eurogames!  There's so many actions, possibilities and paths ... it takes an investment of time and several plays to learn.  But it is epic.  The intro game is an empty shell of itself, but I've had no issue with moving players right into the full game (given the appropriate amount of time and dedication available).  Also plays much better with three, but is still a strong game with four.

Very enjoyable and fairly compact Civilization game (as far as civ games go...it still takes up most of our table!) Players have a lot of important choices to make concerning how to allocate resources, and what to focus on. If you leave military alone you become vulnerable to other players and political events. If you spend too much on Military you may leave yourself with not enough food or resources for other important buildings. It's a great balancing act that takes you through the ages of history. Intriguing and fun that's worth the 2-4 hour playing time.

An impressive game overall.  It achieves what it seeks to accomplish.  Within the enormous depth I also found tremendous theme and balance.  The variety of mechanics and elements to consider in your turn are overwhelming - a bit too much for a first time player, but very rewarding if you are willing to be patient, push through the many hours of gaming and brain burning it takes to remember all the different rules to keep track of.

Classroom Copy - This game is exquisitely balanced and brutally punishing of mistakes.  I absolutely adore this game and the only thing keeping it from earning a full 10/10 is that I think the BGO Global cards are an improvement, and if it can be improved, it's not perfect and if it's not perfect, it's not a 10.

The swings in luck are a bit much at tiems. Approximately equal players can play back to back with wildly  different outcomes. I just played a game where I had a military advantage and lucked into FOUR consecutive wars, for an easy win. But I've also had games where it goes the other way. I think Def/Col are slightly overpowered, since good for both strong and weak militaries. Still a great game though.
-----
Update: Played a dozen or so times now. Love it every time. Especially after the 4th game or so, when I'm pretty sure I started getting all the rules right. Wish I could get my wife to play with my son and me. 2 player works, but is not ideal.
---
My bar for games that last over three hours is pretty high (relative to my own preferences only). I've only played the the full game, and only once, but I really enjoyed it. Even though I was the whipping boy with the wimpiest army. Even though it has one of my least favorite mechanics: "choose a player to attack". I prefer when there's some rationale behind choosing the target, like something they have that you want, etc. But like I said, I still liked it. I like that there are so many paths to development that each player's path can and does feel different form the others. This is large part due to the wide variety of cards. In general I also am not a huge fan of card driven games either. So it's a bit surprising to me that I like this.

Was thinking about this game for very very long, luckily my Secret santa 2010 bought this and Making of the President for me. And he made an excellent choice. This game was nowhere to be found. Thanks so much Santa :kiss: 

Awesome. Just played our first simple game. And lost big time. But it's great to learn the game and we can see the possibilities the advanced/full game will offer. After we played for a second time I can see how this is only meant to learn the mechanics, since you are building up to something and then it abruptly ends.

So we decided to move on to the advanced game. And it's brilliant. This feels more like a game, but I'm still eager for more haha. But we will try some more advanced games first since we got a couple of things wrong and forgot to score some things. But we really love it.

This game has been circling around on my gaming radar as a very faint blip ever since it came out in 2006. I remember thinking that newcomer Vlaada had balls of unobtanium to present this sort of game [i]as a newcomer[/i], but apparently his approach met with a lot of favourable approval from the gaming enthusiasts to end up this high on the ranking lists. (At the time of writing, it is at #4.) Rank doesn't say much, of course, certainly not on an individual level, but still, you need a special type of game to reach that high and apparently TtA is such a type. Unfortunately due to the game's high price and long playing time I never purchased a copy, nor could I persuade anyone to play a game with me‚Äîthat is, if I remembered it existed. 

But eventually it [i]did[/i] happen, someone was willing to walk me and two other newcomers through precisely 2/3rds of the full game. We didn't finish due to timing constraints: we'd already been at it for like 5 hours and it was time to call things a day. Night, even. I should add that before we started playing I knew very little of TtA: only that it was, more or less, a boardgame version of the earlier editions of computer Civilization (I and II, to be precise), but then without some complex features, such as a map or a tech tree. After finishing our trial game I could indeed agree with that assessment, although I think it is better if you just leave out the comparisons alltogether. TtA is, when you get right down to it, a huge exercise in constructing a snowball growth engine, held back by several 'brakes' on both population and resources, which are intertwined themselves too (as you need population to produce resources in the first place). TtA is the answer to the question [i]I'm done with Puerto Rico, what's next?[/i] The civilization you're building is really just window dressing to give you something to visualise the costs and benefits of every card in the game better.

Because that is basically all you do: grab cards from a row, 'construct' them on your tableau paying resources, then activate them using workers (which had to be 'grown' in an earlier action), reap the benefits, and slowly (especially that) build up your engine over, like, 70 or 80 cards until you begin to hit the actual point cards and can see how your initial design held up against your expectations of the future. Despite our rules explainer assuring us (on multiple occasions no less) that the game would be quicker with experience, that the engines would run more smoothly with experience, ..., he could not really deny that 2/3rds of the game (already taking 2 hours in an ideal case) is spent struggling in an uphill battle for bits and scraps, when, at some point, it simply becomes 'easier' to do things (meaning it takes less actions to do so, and the compound effect of several wonders and technologies making their influence felt), and then, finally, the race for points can begin. It is, in other words, the perfect game for many gamers: no brains required, no complex emergent game patterns, only discussions on what path to take, and then repeating the required growth actions for an eternity. The computer game does exactly the same thing, but at least there you can save the game state and pick up where you left if you feel like it. Plus it handles a lot of micromanagement stuff (although it introduces others). Here, you need to finish what you started :x.

TtA represents a type of game which does not really agree with me. If I must/need/want to play a snowball growth engine, then I want to be done in an hour or so. If someone manages to obtain an insurmountable lead, the suffering for the other players is short, and the restart is quick an easy. (What notably bugged my partner, for example, is that some events clearly punish the player in last place. I know from experience with Olympos (the Ystari game) that such a mechanism will bite in the first games, and then players learn to divert effort to make sure the last player revolves around the table. But in TtA the penalties seem harsher, and can really put you back significantly... which is hardly acceptable in a game of this length.) The length of TtA probably makes it eminently suitable for many hundreds of repeat plays... But that is something which is not going to happen at my table anyway. So the added complexity in the various paths to take is wasted on me.

In the end I'm glad I got to play the game, as I now have a good idea of what it is about. But it's not a game I need to play again anytime soon, if at all. I'll stick to simpler fare. If that doesn't make me a True Gamer, then so be it. The game itself does not really deserve the rate I'm handing out: it [i]is[/i] a fine example of the genre, certainly one to look out for if you like this kind of thing. But it's not for me.

I was tempted to rate this game lower due to the issues.  But I want to rate my games based on my enjoyment so it is a 9.

The reality is that this game has some issues that you are probably already aware of. 

Didn't like:

1. The games is basically a video game.  It has a lot of counting and whatnot that would be a lot easier if it was played on a computer.  It slows the game down.

2. You need experienced gamers or it will be slow.

But if you can get over that this is a must play.  Kind of like Antiquity the joy is in the building and experimenting first, winning second.

Prior to playing my first game, my original question was, "Could THIS be the civ game for me?"  Now that I have played games in the following order: one full game, and then two simple games, one advanced game and then a simple game, I am submitting a big "Yes."  My first game was like being thrown into the deep end of the pool.  I enjoyed the rush, but it was a bit much to absorb everything.  The feeling after having played the simple game was that it was too short, but it was good to get a handle on the running of the game as well as reinforce what I was taught in the first game - at least as far as game mechanics go.  The simple game left me needing more of the full game.  The advanced game is better, but it opens up all kinds of worms as far as what certain Age III Military cards mean.

Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization is simply an awesome very heavy Euro game!!!  Having played Sid Meyer's Civilization computer games and Avalon Hill's Advanced Civilization - I find Through the Ages to be a fantastic game that captures the two other games just mentioned in a Euro game.  The abstracted military mechnanisms, abstracted expansion of your civilization, technological achievements gained and marvelous wonders built by one's civilization are well designed.  Historic leaders of various ages are present.  There are game mechanisms for forming pacts between players, a bidding mechanism for gaining territories, minor abstracted combat in the form of raids and major war in an abstract kind of way.  Just like other epic civlization games, there are whammy cards that can hurt or help your civilization designed in which players use a unique "seeding" mechanism to put these cards in play and hopefully reap the benefit over time when the cards appear for their impact to be realized. If you like Civilization games - Through the Ages is a MUST for your collection.  Through the Ages is also a game that players enjoy playing over and over again.

Many rules but they make thematic sense. More condensed than Civ video game. Might be good only for online play due to downtime and book-keeping. Very thematic, which comes from the mechanics of balancing population, resources, tech, etc, not only from the cards. Perhaps only good for the Full game, less than that doesn't feel balanced.
It's such a good game and would be a 10 if not for its problems with f2f play (too long, too many bits, etc).

It is a very deep game, it is very fiddly, very complex and very long!

Is it very much fun? Not for the most I think, at least not for our gaming-group. And we do play hardcoregames too...

It caters for the right kind of group and player - and for them this might be a jewel. For me it is a spraint one, because something is completely amiss: elegance!

     A very good 'Civ' like game.  If you're looking for a game that is full of 'whizz bang' action- this is NOT it.  If, however, you looking for a thematic sense of the rise and fall of your own little Empire (Mine is Freedonia- Hail, Hail FREEDONIA, Land of the BRAVE, and, THE FREE!!!)  *Apologies to the Marx Bros.* that is a constant tightrope balance, you'll like this game.  In a lot of ways, its like 7 Ages- but without a lot of the tedious elements that make 7 Ages take so long.  Quite good game, highly recommended for Eurogamers looking for a good game with quite a bit of conflict, and for wargamers looking for a 'Euroish' building game that still has some very edgy conflict.

Posiblemente, el mejor juego de civilizaciones que existe. Algo abstracto, pero eso no le quita genialidad. Partidas bastante largas, pero es lo que se espera de este tipo de juegos. Las versiones corta y media est√°n bien para aprender a jugar, pero se pueden quedar cortas. El juego de verdad es la versi√≥n larga, pero... se puede hacer larga xD Eso s√≠, este juego vale lo que dura.
Una peque√±a cosa que no me gusta, es la importancia del poder militar. Si no tienes poder militar alto, vas a perder. Lo necesitas o, para atacar, o para que no te ataquen, pero como te quedes atr√°s en la carrera militar, va a ser muy duro. El juego recompensa atacar al d√©bil, y creo que es el √∫nico y principal fallo que tiene.
Adem√°s, el factor azar tambi√©n es alto, si consigues tener las combinaciones de l√≠deres y cartas √≥ptimas, es muy dificil perder la partida. Y al rev√©s, si las cartas deciden no salir, si vas pensando en hacer una estrategia, se siente. Una pena que un juego tan grande como este tenga esos dos fallos.

RATING: 7
Civilization is a genre created by game called Civilization. But to this date it's still unclear whether the boardgame or the PC game (by Sid Meier) is the trigger of the genre. It doesn't really matter anyway, since the elements inside are things that make this genre great.

- Span of ages in time, from primitive to modern.
- Different technologies to research, giving many abilities
- Different civilizations, giving each player different powers
- Explore the world and use it resources
- Managing population, happiness, and other resources to successful civilizations
- Complex gameplay

Those all the great aspects of Civilization game. And to some extend, Through the Ages nearly captures it all. Sid Meier should be proud, since it's inspired by the PC game more than the boardgame. Great game, great mechanics, all together in one. The randomized setup and how things are available game make it very high replayability. Luck has some part here, but ultimately the decision is the one that make or break the victory. A perfect situation for controlled luck. Combined with there are so many path to victory, I can say this game is perfect.

Components: The tokens are a bit too small for my taste. In general the iconography is very clear. Good layout of information. Linen-coated cards. The various tracks are a bit confusing.

The income tracks (science and culture) are perhaps harmful to the game. Yes, it saves me from having to add up my income every turn. But if I forget to adjust the track, it could be several rounds before I realize the error, and now it's too late to adjust my income. Better to perform a full audit each round.

Experience: Simple production system (food, resources), but the cards lead to quickly differentiating strategies between opponents.

So far I've only played the beginner game.

An incredible game with tremendous replay value, the FRED edition is marred by quickly-warping cards, some typos/omitted info, missing cubes, and wooden discs not demonstrably better than the beads that came with the original edition.  To boot, the scoreboard could, IMO, be organized in a more intuitive way, and so I'll probably make a new one.  Having said that, I've chosen to not let the production quality impact my rating of the game.

Rating 7.5 after first play of basic game. Expect it to rise.
Five games now, last four all advanced. Rating now 8. May still rise further -- perhaps after I win a game.
Finally played the full game -- and won for the first time (game 8). Rating already up to 8.5. Probably won't go higher, though, as the same patterns of development seem to get repeated.
Won again in game 9 (full game once more, with four players -- took a LONG time), and I've had to raise the rating once more to the rarefied level of a 9.

I was absolutely floored the first time I played this getting a full bodied Civ experience with no map.  Vlaada is the man.  He really is.  If you could somehow put elements of this game along with elements from Sid Meier's Civ board game you would have something that would rival any Civ computer game.  I am in love with the cards in this.  So many options, and the drafting and seeded events give every game a unique character.  Also, the ability to play shorter games is pretty sweet for those nights where you don't have hours to play through age IV.

Although I typically use a three-point rating system, I decided to give this a 10. I really do want to play it all the time! I am wildly enthusiastic about the game; every subsystem, every little detail, completely fascinates me.

(Okay, that comment was from 2009-06-13. Three years later, it's dropped from rotation after ~50 plays heavily fueled by BGG & self-made leader/wonder variants. Still Top Shelf, but no longer compelled to play it every - or any - session.)

Preliminar rating. Only half match for testing it without events, but it seems so great design. I have spanish edition. Components are awful and flimsy. Cards looks great, but not boards. Bad production quality for such an expensive game. That's a pity. Game seems very good and it deserves better quality components.

The word "epic" gets tossed around a lot these days, but that's precisely the word I'd use to describe this game. A tour-de-force of history that's supremely satisfying to play despite its very lengthy playtime. The amount of choices you can make are staggering. The mechanics are deep and complex but the rules do a good job of introducing new players to the game in phases. This is one that almost always makes its way to the table if we have a few hours to spare.

RATING: 9
This is a masterpiece. This game recreates a lot of the aspects involved in the growth of a civilization, politics / people / culture / resources / military, with cards. Every game is different from the previous, thanks to its enormous amount of cards. I played it twice in a week after learning the game (advanced rules, not even full rules),one with 2 players and one with 3. I believe the game with 4 players could be even more rewarding (I'll try it someday with another good friend) but even longer and slower than with 3. The downtime between players could be a little high, you've got a lot of actions to pick from and the first games are a little slow. Gets better with repetitive playing of course. One of my favorite all-time games. EDIT: after more than 150 plays, I believe that political cards draw is a very strong but random factor. You can be the strongest for 5 turns and never draw an aggression card. Or you can be the weakest and never draw a defense/colonization card. This is very luck-depending and my vote went down from the initial 9.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I played just a few times, but I don't like the enormous downtime in the game. I also don't feel like the game progresses in any way. Time passes, but nothing really changes which makes it rather boring. I'm also disappointed with the event cards, that benefit the leading players while punishing the ones that are behind. It seems rather cruel and it's something I've yet to see in any other euro. The design of the game is also questionable. The scoring board is totally counter-intuitive and I think that the player boards should denote in some way which buildings are public and which are not. I'll have to try it with less players (we only played with 4 so far) and see if it goes any faster, but for now - I don't really like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very abstract, but it is more elegant and cohesive than Civilization: The Board Game.  Still requires knowledge of cards which depresses my rating of the game.

However, the online incarnation of the game is easily a 10.  In fact, it's way better than the physical board game because mistakes are inevitable given the game's fiddly-ness.  But online, the computer makes it so you can't make any mistakes.

At first it seems to take too long for what it is, a mostly tactical game that goes on and on. However, once you get to see the links between all of the interacting 'resources', it turns into an ever changing of game of 'balancing' your civilisation.

RATING: 10
A design tour de force. I am hoping it will stand up to repeat plays (at 3 at the time of rating), but am not certain. Rating could go down or up... but am quite smitten with the theme and mechanics and the elegance of the interaction. 
After a dozen plays(!) in the three weeks I have owned it I have bumped it up a notch. Recommended only with 2 or 3 players - too much down time with 4. Downtime is barely noticeable with 2 (to even my wife -who is fairly sensitive to these things ;) .  
Update, after more than 2 dozen plays in a month and a half, I have upgraded to a 10. This is a brilliant, brilliant game.

Further update. We are now completing 3 player full games in 3 hours, without really pushing it. 4 players we can do in 4 hours or less. Having not played multiplayer as much, but now being able to do so... this maintains its 10 rating. Held for over a year now.

RATING: 8.5
2-4 players, best with 3. 240 minutes(!)

Like the theme (civilization!) and mechanics (civ building) and looks allright. Rating is really high, although it's predecessor scores even higher. As I could find it cheap so I am willing to give this one a try, but may want to replace this one in time with the NEW edition.

One word: Epic.  

The time requirement is going to prevent this from being played as often as I'd like, but I still hope to get it to the table frequently.

There is so much going on that it can feel quite daunting, but if you power through the initial overwhelming feeling, there is a fantastic game to be enjoyed.

There are many moments of frustration when you aren't able to do everything that you want to do when you want to do it, but it is a good frustration.  It's not like the Agricola frustration, where you know you are going to be punished severely if you make a mistake or are a turn late with a certain move.

I enjoy seeing and experiencing how different cards interact, and expect that the variety present will keep this game interesting for a long, long time.

I never thought a civilization game could be any good without a map but Through the Ages proved me wrong!  Love how all the concepts of a civilization game have been abstracted out to a few decks of cards.  There are a lot of different ways to accomplish what you want but you can never accomplish everything you need.  I love that type of tension in a game.

I only have two minor complaints.  First, it very much encourages you to bash on the weakest player.  So long as you understand that going in you'll be fine; the game is very much an arms race and military has a very cold war feel to it.  Second, Through the Ages has had one of the worst print runs ever, constantly plagued with print errors and poor components.  Would love to see some sort of deluxe edition that really knocks it out of the park.

Fantastic game though.  Yeah, it takes a bit to play but it's absolutely worth it.

An interesting and enjoyable game more notable for what it is able to pull off and how than for gameplay. The abstract nature of the design is odd for a civilization game, and ultimately that and the fiddliness of moving around the little pieces put me off of it. I also think the variety of the play is rather limited in my experience; every game seems to come down to someone building up their military and others either doing the same or losing. I have enjoyed the games I have played but feel I have seen most of what the game has to offer. I'd much rather play a civ game with a map--Clash of Cultures is my civ game of choice now. 

Note: I now have played and own the revision of this game, and much prefer it.  The rules changes and graphics overhaul have fixed my problems with the game and made it more enjoyable to play.

"Sid Meier's Civilization for the PC, the Card Game!"

Well, not quite. 

Civilization on the computer has both a strategic and tactical component, with the tactical in this case being the minutia of how to grow and advance your civilization. You struggle with ever-constant decisions throughout the game by having to overcome limited resources, deal with military threats, and get your society out of the dark ages via the advancement of science and theology -- all while trying to keep your people happy and content. You make your choices and the computer calculates the consequences of your decisions.

Through The Ages strips away the strategic element of of the PC Civilization experience and instead makes *you* the computer, wherein the traditional eurogame pastime of pushing cubes back and forth across a tableau now becomes the means of the calculation, thereby making what was merely a function of CPU cycles in the background now the actual game itself. Oddly enough, it works.

My only complaint -- hence why I rate it a 7 instead of an 8 -- is that the game takes way too long for what it is. This is exasperated even more so if you've been exposed to other Civ-type games that occupy a similar headspace (Chudyk's Glory to Rome and Innovation come to mind). I've played with three and with four, but now I find myself hoping from now on that I'll only play it with two...even if that makes for a comparatively lesser experience.

El juego es redondo, todo en este juego fluye y encaja a la perfecci√≥n, hay muchas posibilidades para ir mejorando la posici√≥n de cada jugador en la partida, no todos tienen que ir a lo mismo. El tema militar est√° perfectamente encajado, es como una guerra fr√≠a, si te quedas atr√°s todos ir√°n a por t√≠, de manera que se ven pocas guerras y agresiones si todo el mundo se mantiene en la carrera militar. Las cartas dan opciones a todos, no hay que ofuscarse con tal o cu√°l tecnolog√≠a/maravilla/l√≠der, siempre saldr√°n otros m√°s adelante. Es un juego en el que se premia al que es capaz de conseguir cierto equilibrio en cuanto a crecimiento/producci√≥n/ciencia/poder militar/descontento/cultura ... Un juego genial !!

La pega es que hay mucho tiempo de espera entre turno y turno, el juego es largo, pero es divertido, no lo veo un problema, lo que s√≠ es un problema es la espera mientras juegan los dem√°s.

My initial rating was based on a single play at a game night.  The more I read about the deep strategy, the more I wanted to play again.  Also heard it is an excellent 2 player game, so I finally bought the game, but haven't gotten it to the table yet.

RATING: 7
First play was long, but was so much fun that time flew by.  Current plays are now about 1 hr/player.  More enjoyable than Civ/Adv Civ and plays in half the time.  I appreciate the small box and smaller area the game takes up, but the tiny discs make setup a pain.  The FRED rulebook is pretty bad as well.  Several areas in the rules are not clear (i.e. discontent workers, military discard pile), and if you're playing any version other than the Simple game, then you'll be flipping around all over the rules looking for setup and rules inquiries.

As for the gameplay, it's pretty darn perfect.  There's a steep learning curve, and the game is quite fiddly, but once you get a game or two under your belt, you'll be glad you put forth the effort.  There are so many directions in which you can take your civilization.  Will you lead in military? Science? Production? Population? Or a combination of the above? What kind of a government will you enact? What wonders will you construct? etc.  All of this is there, and more.  This game has a tremendous amount of tension in it.  You'll always be short something, whether it's resources, science, or actions.  How you best deal with these shortfalls is what will determine the winner, usually.

The designer has come up with a great system where multiple players can all affect one another, since there is no "map". Scales wonderfully from 2 to 4 players.

Edit: Lowering my rating a bit, as I've played this so much online and in person, I've become a bit burned out on it.

not much bad to say about this one.  Extremely deep euro game.  There are plenty of similar alternatives out there but this one will give you the whole bowl of soup if you are into games like that.  Wont be a quick play either so buckle up, you're in for some epic gaming.  But if you are an epic gaming kind of guy this one is for you.  A healthy dose of paralysis by analysis in this one.  But truly a rewarding experience for the hardcore gamer.  This one definitely deserves its high rating!

This game's ranking is well earned. It overcomes its many minor flaws (lackluster art, tiny and difficult to handle counters, lots and lots of rules) through shear depth of play. I have only played two-player games, but even so, every game is truly unique, and the timing of cards means that each player's strategies change multiple times during each game. Both tactical and strategic thinking are needed, as well as a small degree of luck. Above all, though, the game is fun. It's not short and it's not quite elegant, but it is a great game.

The full game with 4 - has way too much downtime (would rate much lower with 4).  I would suggest only playing the full game with 3, and sticking to the shorter game with 4.

I bought this game in February for my birthday.  Two months later, I had logged over 50 plays.  I've slowed down some, but I still really enjoy it.  The only reason I've slowed down is that I want to get more 3 or 4 player games of TtA down.  Most of my games have been against the same person.

A fantastic, if abstract, reimagining of Avalon Hill's Civilization. Lots of tough decisions to make in terms of how to manage resources, and the event cards keep it interesting.

The odds that I'll play Civ or Advanced Civ again have dropped dramatically. This game is a little shorter and much more interesting in terms of the decisions and tradeoffs you have to make.

This an excellent card-based civilization expansion game. I'm wondering if pre-stacking the deck in random sections might prevent some cards from coming out too late to be of much use (and I suggested it to the designers, perhaps prematurely). I'm really impressed with those crazy Czechoslovakians! 

A Civilization game that plays in under 3 hours has been a holy grail for Game Designers for quite some time and I believe it has now been accomplished by Vlaada (Vladim√É¬≠r) Chv√É¬°til. To experience this Designer's genius directed in a completely different direction, please see [gameid=31481].

This game has now entered by list of top ten games of all time.

This is a very good game but I do have a few concerns.

I'm concerned that this game could represent a choking hazard because food and rocks look EXACTLY the same.  You've been warned!!!!

Also, if you look closely at the box, you will see that the actual title of this game should be written like this:

THROUGH the AGES
A STORY OF CIVILIZATION

There is no colon, and almost all the letters are capitalized.  BoardGameGeek (see, it's not so hard) should pay more attention to punctuation and capitalization!

Quite a good representation of Sid Meyer's civilization game. It is its greatest strength and its biggest weakness. A strength because Civ is one of the most involving and satisfying simulation games ever devised. A weakness because most people who would love this have probably already spent weeks, months if not years playing that game in a format that is slightly less prone to have you on your knees looking for a small, round piece of wood trying to escape.

Still... I am looking forward to sitting down and playing a full game someday.

RATING: 7
A clever and thematic civilisation game that does the tech tree development side of Civ very well - echos of the computer game abound. The conquest/military side of things is not so well done - partly because the game plays so long with more than 3, and the nature of the military engine only works properly with more than 3.

The lack of a board doesn't feel right for me given th level of detail in the mechanics. Because of the long playing time it can incur the 'multi-player' solitaire epithet - i.e., apart from the military aspect of the game the player interaction requires a careful assessment of what other players are doing and therefore what cards they would like to pick up. However to keep the game moving along you really only have time to optimise your selections for what would be good for your own tableau. This is often a problem with build an engine euros but more so with Through the Ages due to the playing time.

Tentative rating after one play. I think the rating might go up with further plays but I can't see this become a favourite of mine despite the very interesting mechanics.

Too much shuffling tiny wooden pieces around.

Update. Played it again with 3 players. Much, much, much better game. Almost no downtime and lots of fun. We finished an advanced game in around 3 hours. Next time we'll try the full game as we felt the game really got going when we stopped.

Update 2: Weird game. When it clicks it's a blast and would easily rate a 9, but sometimes it just falls flat and is a long tedious game of solitaire and would rate at 6 at best. Lowered rating again.

Totally a port of one of the best computer games of all time.  I'm waiting to give it a 9 until I see if the fixed deck construction or the lack of "tree" in the tech tree bugs me.

Update 8->9: Nope.  Doesn't bug me.  Order of cards is what makes every game different.

Update 9-7: 25 games in and positive (yes, professional game designer, not that it should matter) that some bits just don't work.  Biggest one is that Tactics need to be in the Civil Deck.  The randomness is awful.  Military card row would work except it hurts the game too much by removing the surprise events.

The main problem with the first edition is war. The wars are devastating to one player and when I discovered that, it took a game of 9 right down to 5. Hope the second edition fixes this ridiculous bug in a otherwise fantastic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
There are a lot of strategies to this game.  It has just enough interaction (aggression/wars/pacts) to keep this from becoming too solitaire.  I like economic engine games, and this is one of the better ones.  There are just a ton of cards and a lot to think about when selecting one.  But it gets easier and plays more quickly once you become familar with them.

Wow, after 4 plays, the play time has come down.  The game has gotten even better. My rating has gone from 8 to 9..and now a 10! This has quickly become one my favorite games.  Just a ton of theme.  All the games play out differently due to the variety of the cards.  Excellent design.  I can't believe how a game without a map can be so close to computer Civ.  I wish the quality were better or the price were lower.  The combination of those 2 factors (along w/knowledge of a reprint) are the only things keeping me from buying it.

Finally bought it..3rd edition. Card quality looks really good.  Cards have a textured (linen) feel.  Unfortunately 2 cards (oil and coal) are still misprinted.

Update: I don't get to play this as much since it is available online.  Dropping from a 10 to a 9 due to decreased table time...plus the science/military strategy seems like it might be too important.

RATING: 6
I ordered Through the Ages on a bit of a whim. I had been aware of its Top 10 position for a while, and had largely ignored it because of its length and weight. As time has gone, however, I have grown to appreciate heavier games more and more. In addition, I am a big fan of the Civilization computer games, having played 2, 3, and now 4, and I had heard that the board game had structural similarities to the computer game. So I bought it and played it. I was not disappointed. I ended up playing the game a total of four times over the course of 4 days, with three of the games being 2 player and the fourth a 3 player game. Based on those plays, it easily assumed a position on my Top 10 list.

Update: I think my current rating is probably a hard cap on how I can rate the game. It will probably not go down, but it definitely will not go up. Its length is too much of a drag on the game, as both of my three player games have taken 4 hours+, and that is more than I usually want to spend on a single game. Three hours? Sure! Three and a half hours? Probably. Over four hours? Eh, that is pushing it.

Another Update: This game has been coming out a bit more lately and I have been enjoying it a LOT every time I play it. This is enough to tip it over into nine territory. The fact that we are finishing in 3 to 3.5 hours now has also been very, very nice.

RATING: 10
Players develop a civilization, from Antiquity through to contemporary times.   Players take turns to spend "actions" (civil and military) to do stuff - populate, increase their food or resource production, construct buildings - forces - mines/farms, draft future purchases off a Show Manager-esque track of diminishing price, and so on.  A lot of the game is low level shuffling of cubes and beads from card to card, which changes the effect of the piece moved (i.e. yellow beads start as potential population, turn into people, and become a building/soldier when allocated to a card).  The scope of the game is astonishing, and much beyond a short paragraph here.  You begin with almost nothing, but must grow an economy, while keeping the people happy, the corruption down while the science and culture (VP's) increase.  An excellent, almost faultless rulebook presents the rules in 3 chunks of increasing complexity, gradually adding in aggression, wars, pacts, etc.  The cards are excellent, but the rest of the playing material is only so-so (the slippery glass beads were replaced by cubes very quickly).  The game is long (two player "introduction" games take about an hour, but it goes up from there).  We're knocking off the two player full game just inside 3 hours.  Rating has climbed with each playing - after eight games I'm convinced that it is top shelf.  Excellent, well designed game.

I consider this game to be a crowning achievement in game design.  The mechanics of the game are simply brilliant, and the game elegantly and yet complexly gives the feel of civilization building without needing to even bother with a map.  Everything in this (incredibly compact) box just works, and it works well.  It rewards multiple plays, it carries its theme pretty well, and it packs a LOT of game into a small, efficient package.  One of the all-time greats.

RATING: 7
March 2013 - I've played this game atleast 30 times and I've changed my rating to an 7 - in my opinion, most games play out in a similar fashion; someone falls behind in culture, realizes that the only way to win is go military and switches to a military effectivly switching everyone elses strategy to a military strategy as well. Additionally, I don't like the decision that I'm often presented with - if its close between you and someone else, you'll often have to attack the player in 3rd or 4th to have a chance to win...I hate making that choice. Finally, this is a much better computer game/app than board game.

June 2012 - I've been playing this a ton online. My rating of the game is now a 10 - it's so good, I'd never turn down a game. With the online implementation, there's none of the cumbersome bookkeeping. Definitely a game that has grown on me. I can't stop thinking about it and definitely want to play it more.

Initial comments after playing at Origins 2010: 
I played the game and thought it was good. There is a little bit too much bookkeeping though and the game certainly takes a long time. I rated it a 6 because I can't see myself often wanting or having the time to play such a long game. 2010-07-09

RATING: 6
A tough game to rate, and one that might raise after future playings. The customized civs, each creating different unique empires, is done perfectly. Also the use of famine, unhappiness, and corruption act to check some of the runaway leader issues in a realistic fashion. The randomness in cards and events creates tons of replayability. My only gripes are the constant fiddling with resources and the lack of psychological interaction with my fellow players. More of an exercise in accounting and optimizing, but at least a very flavorful and engrossing one.
 
Rating is tentative and may raise after playing the full game.

RATING: 9
Rating based almost solely on 12+ 2-player games, only 1 3-player game in the mix.  That said this game is excellent.  I normally enjoy a more 4X-oriented game with a map and such, but this game does a great job of giving you the feeling of the challenges of lifting up a civilization from scratch.  Card drafting dictates the feats your civilization is capable of, and worker placement dictates which of those benefits you can reap.  Resource scarcity is always a problem, but it doesn't feel as crippling here as in some games; you can accomplish what you want with the right plan.  I haven't played the new edition of this but hopefully they fixed some of my complaints, such as imbalances with wars and that obnoxious Michelangelo card.

2011\08\06:  This is a great Civilization game.  Now I understand why it is ranked so highly.  I had gone 8 months between my two plays, and it took quite a while to get back up to speed.  I am really looking forward to playing this again soon.

2013\03\17:  Had a four player "short" Advanced game last night.  For starters, this game is best with three players.  With four, there is way too much downtime.  This title also suffers from the same problem [thing=31260][/thing] does:  You can be easily 'steamrolled' by experienced players who have intimate knowledge of the cards.  Best played with a group of equal experience.

In my three hour game, I had about 90 minutes of fun, which was around the time the most experienced player pulled off the Michaelangelo + Bascillica combo and was garnering 16 points per turn.  This is a borderline game-breaker in the Advanced game for me.  My personal rating has dropped from 9 to 8.

Great civilization game.  This has been what I have been waiting for since [gameid=71].  A longer complex game, but not as long as or complex as [gameid=71].

Basically a "meaty" game that takes some time, but it won't take all day or a weekend to play.

I love playing this game, and it is my favorite strategy game.

The game mechanics aren't as complex as it might appear, but there are a ton of cards to work through and plenty of opportunities to customize your overall strategy.    It's essentially a VP-churning civ-building game, with four resources:  people, science (light bulbs), rocks, and food.   There is an element of engine-building here too, as your resources feel like they can go up exponentially if you do it right.  Consumption and corruption provide the necessary diminishing returns. The aggression and war cards are handled in a simple way, but the ramifications can be far-reaching.   One warning, however:  this game is "fiddly" to the max.  You are constantly sliding tiny bits and cards all over the place - if you can't handle that for 3-4 hours, then look away.  I appreciate the different strategies that can be pursued and the high number of effective card combinations to explore.

It's ironic how so many people say that they will only play this online or electronically.  Silly.   At that point, why not just play the computer game Civilization?

The small bits are quite fitting for micro-managing a civilization!  Great mechanics in place for keeping track of everything your civilization gets involved with.  I wish it didn't take so long to play though...I fear its length will keep it off the regularly played list.

Played several times. Definitely see the elegance of the design, but too abstracted for my taste. Also, the mechanisms of the military almost encourages a player to be repeatedly bullied by others, especially in 2-player games. Getting kicked while already down is no fun at all.

I loved this one at first, but soon discovered that it's FAR too unforgiving for a game of its length.  Make a mistake or two and you'll sit there through hours of getting pounded while having no recourse whatsoever.  It's still fun to play as long as nobody screws up!

Love the game play, though.  But after it was updated to "A NEW Story of Civilization," I got the new version and donated this old one to Goodwill in August 2016.  After buying the new version, I didn't think I'd be able to interest anyone in trading for the old version, so I just donated it.

This is another of those games that I recognize as mostly good without any real desire to play it myself.  I should want to play it: I love civ games and long heavyweight strategy titles.  I don't know whether it's the length, or the lack of a map, or the randomness of the cards and events, or the extreme restrictions on your actions, or the massive importance of military buildup, or the fact that you need to play 3 successively more difficult teaching games just to learn the beast.

The downtime may be the worst thing about it.  You really want to play with 4, so there's some good competition for the cards, tension in the auctions, and a middle ground in the arms race.  If you do, though, you'll be sitting there doing nothing for large chunks of time while the other players take their turns.   Last time I played, I actually broke out my DS during these periods. 

Even players who really like the game seem to acknowledge its flaws.  I've heard complaints about the timing of cards coming down through the display, such that you might not even get a shot at the one you need.  Getting the right military cards (not selected,  but drawn at random) also seems to be an issue.  You can have the dudes, but be stuck with an out-of-date formation for the whole game.  Or, you can have the overall strength, but no way to exploit it w/out the wars/aggressions.  This is also one of those games where knowing the cards in the deck is a huge deal.  Which leaders work with your strategy, etc.  It seems like having the same main deck every time and seeing the same cards every game would hurt replayability.  

It doesn't look like much, I have to say.  The art is very spare, and the components tiny.

Any way, I may have to try it a few more times to decide for certain.  It seems likely that those will be online games, since that's how everyone around here seems to play it.  Haven't really rushed to do that, as I prefer face to face for my board games.

A more abstract, and probably more fun civilization game than Sid Meier's Civ.  I've really gotten to dig this game, with some good replayability.  It takes a while to play, which is the only downside I can think of.

RATING: 8
A nice epic wide-open game - certainly more worthy of comparison to civilization than lighter attempts. You just can't get an epic feel in less than 3-4 hours. Some downtime (not the worst, since you do need some time to plan), and the bits are a bit... tiny. Not good to lose the jewels in deep carpet.

Finally got the game! The only thing that held me from getting it is because it has no map (I know it should'nt be matter). When a friend is selling  his used copy (only few times played) at a good price, I grabbed it in an instant.   

Played the game for the 1st time on 8th July 2013. My first impression is that what an amazing game. It doesn't need a map, it's just brilliant even without one! The game has bookkeeping and I normally dislike it (to a certain extend) but I like the one in this game.

I understood why the game can take so long. The fact that you need to finish all the cards in the whole deck of an age before moving on to the next age is the main reason, other than player taking their turn.
 
It's probably has become one of my favorite game just like that! It's also my very first Vlaada Chatil game that I've played although I own his other designs. It really deserves the top 5 BGG ranking.

The rulebook is hard to grasp and I was fortunate that a friend was willing to help.

My copy is 2nd Edition 1st printing by FRED. It has been corrected with the fix pack.

[b][Update][/b]: I've scanned the player boards in the recent editions and made a copy for myself as earlier edition doesn't come with these boards.

this is possibly my favourite euro. And i do consider it much more a euro than a true civ game. Its a game of collecting the right cards and managing your economy (spreadsheet) to get those precious vps. It does tell a bit of the civ story and theme through the cards but you could easily swap the theme for running a shopping centre or anything else that passes through time.

There are a ton of cards with this game, that provide plenty of variety, numerous ways to score points and a challenging econmic engine to build and manage. Its very easy to shoot your self in the foot by the mid game, or through use of the military cards, shoot someone else in the foot. being a card game, theres a little room for bluffing too. Works best with 3 in my experience.

While this isn't something I would like to play all the time because of its length, it says a lot about a game that I cannot possibly win that I would rate it so high.  We played 3 games back to back and I never got any better at it.

While the game has a runaway leader problem, I ultimately think it's just because of my poor play.  I think this is just a game you need to 'get' in order to maximize your engine and I have yet to reach that point.  I don't know if I ever will.  Despite my inability to create a scoring machine, it's still fun to try to maximize the efficiency of your turns and just go at it.  The downtime, however, even at 2p, is insane.  I can't imagine playing a 4p game.  I would lose my tits!

Being a huge fan of Sid Meyer's Civilization on the computer, I decided to pick up this game. It was a tough decision because there is now a Sid Meyer's civ board game, and I didn't know how to choose, but this game got better reviews so I took a chance. I am so glad I did, after 2 plays this game rocketed up to my absolute favorite game on the shelf. Past old favorites like Pandemic, Power Grid, Ticket to Ride, Last Night on Earth, and Agricola. This is the first Vlaada Chvatil game I have played, but I really enjoy it. At first, the rules are very daunting, and this is not a game to just jump into blindly. The first game I played seemed like it took forever, and I had to reread the rule book afterwards to find I had make so many mistakes it wasn't funny. After the 2nd game, the rules made more sense and the game flowed nicely and we were able to get into the more advanced ages and really have some fun. I will admit that I have tinkered the rules a little (house rules) but mostly this game is great right out of the box.

Enjoyed my first game played of Through the Ages. It gaved me a good idea of the game mechanics. Played 1st era only. It's a very long game.

As much fun as Civilization by Avalon Hill. Lots of different routes you can go. Looking forward to my next game to better know the cards. 


Played a second game. It was a two player game and played through almost the 3rd age. I had the least military starting about the mid game, (before it was very close, sometimes we had the same amount), but I still was able to get 3 colonies. With James Cook, I got lots of culture points with my colonies.

I was leading in culture points by a huge margin. In the 3rd age, my cousin develope more a military edge over me. He did 2 raids. He destroyed 3 of my Iron Mines and 3 Jornalism urban buildings. Journalism was giving me 2 culture and 2 science points for each building. He received lots of rocks to build stuff at my expense.

We stop when the pile was getting low in the 3rd age. It was going to be a tight race. When we stop, he was doing more culture points than me. In his hand he had 2 political cards which I lose 7 culture points and he gains 7 culture points. So right there, he would of closed in with 28 points.

I had a runaway lead in culture points at the end of the ancient, 1st and 2nd ages. In the 3rd ages with his political cards and a bigger army than me, he turned the momentuam a in his favor.

Next time I'll know how powerful 3rd age political cards can be. Also, that in a 2 player game,we can't do a pact to save our asses.

*UPDATE*

Though, I enjoy this game very much, one thing I do not like is in the last era, it`s too much of a wargame for my taste. Start of the game is excellent, the end not so much in my opinion. If you are not high on military, get ready for the mother of all ass-kicking. My end game wasn`t fun at all. I was like, what am I doing wrong? I had a very strong start.

For my taste, just the bit too long for what it delivers. Plus I genuinely suck at it (4 games, 4 times last), maybe this does make me biased ;) Unfortunately this will not get too much table time due to its length, but I know I will want to play it until I'm not last once...
In total, very good and extremely cleverly designed game. Fun factor is low, but enjoyment is high nevertheless. That is, until you look at the time at the end of the game.

Edit after 4 real and 10 or so online games: I show symptoms of addiction. Last time I felt this was when I played chess in my teens. Still pretty much suck at he game, but when I win it feels like a grand achievement as it's probably due to above average concentration and focus.
Luck factor is considerably high as noticed in a solo 2p play. Player 1 was ridiculously ahead in military, but player 2 drafted all aggression and war cards.

Edit after a few more games:
For me, more fun online than in real life, which casts a shadow on its qualities as an actual board game, but this is subjective. Needs a lot of play with the right group to be enjoyed. A niche product with a tremendous fun factor for the target group.

I get the appeal but definitely not for me.  Too long.  Mean player interaction.  Fiddly.

I don't think I'll ever play this again.  Also the MSRP is outrageous considering what comes in the box.

really super interesting super absorbing game ... lots of choices and every choice leads down a differing path ... everything you do has to balance, and the military has to be looked at very well, as you just do not wish to lag behind ... this is THE civilization building game, every move matters -- if there is one complaint -- it plays far too long , not many will sit over the table to play in person, which is a shame; also there can be many fiddly pieces and one has to remember the rules as to when each age ends, which leaders and how much population are dropped -- great for on-line play, and the positives far outweigh the negatives -- one needs a ton of experience in this game to compete -- with each play , this game just grows and grows -- a serious winner

RATING: 4
game works and is fun to play. likely would never play with 4 (far too much down time).
the game is highly fiddly as you move counters back and forth, on and off cards, in addition there are many small rules involving card interaction that need to be learned and understand or you spend extra time looking them up in the rules. (that said the rules address all of these very well).
A good number of these rules could be removed with little effect on gameplay. For example .... Wonders taken after the first one cost an additional action point for each existing wonder you've built. does this rule impact actual game play yes a little, would the game change with the elimination of the rule, essentially no... but if I remember the rule and you don't you gain a big advantage especially early due to the compounding effect of an extra action. So you really have to police everyones actions to make sure that the rules are collectively followed.... Another fiddly type of rule is that some cards have to be held for a turn and others can be played immediately...
why have this??? really has little impact.... 

However, the big reason for the lower rating is the game fails in its comparison to other games requiring a similar time commitment that scratch the same itch. for example antiquity is a quicker game, has cleaner game play with fewer exceptions, and and equal amount of strategic and tactical play. So i'd happily play TtA again, its just that I would choose to play other games first. 

I do not see a need to add it to my collection. 

lowered rating from 6.5 to 5.5 with additional plays... has serious beat on the trailing/weakest player issues, and a innocent mistake early can realistically eliminate a player when compounded with the pick on the weakest player issue... very hard to catch back up. 

Also, having played 4 times in 3 days, I can say that game play is pretty repetitive. most cards are essentially the same from era to era with a cost adjustment. Are there many paths to take, yes... do all the paths feel essentially the same. yes. 

(updated again- lowered rating to 4 - this game is a tough call, i like the idea of the game i just hate playing it as it feels like work and just way to fiddly)

A very interesting civilization game with some excellent cards. Everything else sort of let me down - the components are tiny and hard to manage, the military track is an essential strategy and simply cannot be ignored, the playtime is too long for the enjoyment factor and most importantly, it is nearly impossible not to make some sort of accounting mistake during a game.

90-120m, best with 4 players. 5+ plays.

Pretty good.  It feels like it could go through one more development/design stage to clean the game up a little more.  It just feels a little too long for what is going on, and a bit "inelegant" in how you shuffle resources around.Best to be played with three players.  While the game with four players was fine, you could feel the downtime and the length of the game seemed a little of on the excessive side.

Difficulty rating this game. I find the game extremely interesting on one hand, but where the progression of the card drafting and micromanagement of one's economy, science, and cultural production (balanced with staying on your toes militarily)... where all of that draws me in thematically and I can appreciate it. But, the overall fiddliness and the fact that if someone snags "Coal" before I do, then I can likely never get it? That just flies in the face of the civ theme all together. It's just way too abstracted to hold my attention. Just as I am getting into it, the game will slap me in the face and say, "Aha! You are manipulating a spreadsheet!"

I feel like this is personally a "5" for me, but I leave it up at a "6". I will play this online when given occasion, but there are several other games I would much rather play than this.

A good representation of a Civ game, but it has its flaws. The buy-in is huge and will take several games to even learn the finer points of the system. And the interaction between players is not ideal, as one weak player can easily be knocked out early on (or worse, become the punching bag for everyone else). Recommended only for hardcore civ fans willing to play many, many games.

As a 2 player game it is probably about a 6-7. It totally breaks down with more then 2. Even with 2 players it typically devolves into who can kill the other player. Luck of the draw on military cards and Napolian typically decide the game. 

On a side note, the new printing has addressed, and at least tried to fix most of the issues I had with the game. It makes progress and the new edition is probably a solid 3 or 4, possibly better, but the military still seems like the only thing driving the game while making it spectacularly unfun and uninteresting..

All you can ask for in a civ-building game. Tough decision making in a system that plays smoothly once you get used to the production mechanics. If it played about 20 minutes less per player it would be a 10, but it's the best game I've learned in the last year-and-a-half.

[1 play] Wow! I've heard it said that to have a civ-building game that doesn't last 12 hours, one has to leave out something, and TtA left out the map.  I think this is exactly right, and I find it's an element I don't miss.  No combat, no spatial strategy, no world chopped up into little Risky compartments... so what.  
Really enjoyed this and am looking forward to playing again.  I find that even the first time, if you are familiar with the computer game Civilization, then a lot of this is familiar and makes sense.

The more I play it, the better it gets.  The mark of a classic.

Had this one for a coupe years now, have played numerous times both IRL and online, and still consider it the best boardgame I've ever played. Especially after playing the comparatively simpler and clunkier Nations, I've come to realize just how elegant and balanced the design of Through the Ages is. The art is terrible, and manipulating those little dots (especially the white one) is rather tedious at times; but these are nothing next to the brilliance of the game overall.

Best.

Quite an enjoyable game (full game) and very interactive. The instance i played included lots of aggression and war.   Bits could be better and at 5 hrs for 3 players, it's an hour too long.
Update: It's been a month since i played and I can't get it out of my mind :).
Update: Play #2 took only 3hrs 15 mins !!!
Update: Play #3, 2 players. Very good. 3 hrs.

There are a ton of decisions to make and i wouldn't like a game any more complex and weighty than this one. Weight=4. This game wears you out so DON'T PLAY TIRED!!

7/2010: Up to 9. Plays really good PBEM.
8/2010: 9.5

9th play; my first win.  i guess i'm slow or something

3 players is the best. there is one major problem with 2 players:  if the cards come out right, it is too easy to snipe and deny the other player certain techs (like iron, then coal), etc. That's not interesting, but it's effective. With 4 players, it's a tad long and it is easier for an unexperienced player to unbalanced the entire game.

11/2010: It's a 10. I don't even notice the components any longer.

Won the one 3p introductory game we played, but was left entirely unfulfilled, as no decisions of consequence were made in this themeless, fiddly, lengthy game. I'd imagine the full/advanced game is more interesting (and more fiddly and more lengthy), but it's not my kind of game either way.

RATING: 9.5
A highly rated civ game - a genre I enjoy immensely.  Doesn't have a map though, and warfare is somewhat abstract.   And can be quite lengthy (esp. with four players - but great with two or three), but it has the civ elements I like.  Enjoying tremendously after several plays of the Advanced game.

Criticisms made by others: fiddly and too much spreadsheet accounting, too long, too much downtime, too multiplayer solitaire and not enough interaction, warfare is too abstracted, poor quality components. Concern: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/317535]is it really an advanced version of St Petersburg[/url], i.e. a resource management/optimization euro game with an economic engine and a civ theme, rather than a true civ game with random events etc?  As [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/386394]my review[/url] indicates, this is a true civ game.  

One lingering question: why is the weight so heavy?  

Own the updated 3rd English edition (strictly speaking the 2nd edition, 2nd printing), which has improved the components.

Potential solo variant [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/651137/soloplay-variant-for-through-the-ages-is-now-avail]here[/url].

If playing the Advanced rather than Full game, consider removing Michelangelo, as described here: [thread=310504][/thread]

RATING: 9.5
Awesome game that lives up to its reputation as the best civilization game ever. Far better than SM:TBG by FFG, and I doubt anything will ever eclipse it. The decision to eliminate the map was brilliant as it's not needed. The advancement of your civ is all in your techs. As a fan of action points, I'm in heaven here. The pull between building more stuff of what you have, taking cards, adding military, or contributing to a wonder is endlessly interesting.

Now for the chinks in the armor. I don't like the game with 2P (had a very wonky play of that) and will only play with 4P if they're very experienced. Three people seems to be the target number for this. Furthermore, I'm still not sure of the claim that players who know how to use Napoleon/military will rule such that it's a crapshoot as to who gets Nappy. I will say, I used to think Michelangelo was overpowered so perhaps that will prove false here too.

The components of the 3rd edition (2nd printing) suck. I highly recommend buying the new 2009 version as it has fantastic pre-printed player mats.

RATING: 5
Less than the sum of its parts? I thoroughly dislike the handling of military matters - warfare without manouevre. I also dislike that my civilisation can have the pyramids, Genghis Khan and the scientific method in play concurrently. In fairness, many of these criticisms are equally true of other civ games.

Still, at heart it's a spreadsheet.

Ugh, visually DOA and dull to play. However, like all civ games, it's true fault is length. The game drags for a long time and I can't muster the enthusiasm to play through to the end. Kill me.

Really fantastic civ building game, but so long in duration that I don't get it to the table enough.  Also suffers from a horribly broken up rule book.  For Vlaada's funnier lighter in spirit games I don't mind the rule book format, but for this heavier game, a full game rule book with everything covered in one shot would have been much prefered over the broken up rules.  Makes it tough to reference any rules when you are finally ready to get through your first full game.

If you like Sid Meier's Civilization, you must get this game.  Now.  Similar decisions, and the "just one more turn" feeling, without having to worry about a map.

The resource production and usage is so complicated here that it takes a lot of experience to really start to figure it out.  The card drafting, military mechanic, civil and military actions, tactics cards, etc. interact in a way to make the game varied and interesting.  Also the length of the game with the three primary ages really forces players to transition from strategy to strategy to reach victory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Through the Ages has to be commended for providing Civilization-like gameplay in boardgame form. Even without a map, it provides meaningful player interaction through events and a shared card row. I especially like that almost every decision in every turn is important, compared to (for example) Civilization on the computer, where many of your turns may be spent doing boring upkeep and other mechanical decisions. On the flip side, there can be a great deal of downtime in the later stages of the game when each player has multiple actions to take, and sometimes the bookkeeping can get a bit difficult to keep track of (to the point that we have a computer program to do it for us now).

Played 9 times for 17.5 hours.
2p sim - 2 - very simple
2p adv - 4 - enjoyable, but take Michaelangelo out
2p ful - 3 - my favorite way to play as long as player are aggressive
3p adv - 1 - one AP player killed the experience


Nov 2009 - I'm actually writing this comment in 2014, and recollecting my initial impressions of the game. I remember it being unattractive and overwhelming. Lots to track and make work together, and not understanding well enough how battle tactics worked. I did however rate it a 7, and remember see some meat on the bones that I really liked, and I wanted to play it again.

July 2014 - Welp - that was awesome. Played a game of 2p simple and got a ton of rules wrong. (A. TON.) So we ended the game and didn't count scores. (We didn't understand costing correctly for building buildings, and paid the sicene and ore ONCE when the card came into play.) Played again immediately, had a blast. Up to an 8, easy, and hoping to play again soon.

Two days later, got an advanced game in and BLAMO. Upgraded to 10. Adding in the military deck was a blast, and all the decisions about both that and how to structure army. Also, bonus buildings, more development of infrastructure. Nice.

Just played 2p full game and it FLEW by. Definitely would be hard to go back to Advanced game now.First play of Full only took 2h45m, and we weren't racing. I think a full game is doable in 2h30m.

Do not play this with AP players. I just finished a 3p Advnaced game that took 4.5 hours. My turn - 60 seconds; player 3, 2 minutes; player 1, 5 minutes every single turn. This game is painful with that much downtime.

I've heard this described as "civ lite", but I should warm casual gamers that this is NOT "Civ lite". It's all the micromanagement of civ in a lite form; if you hate the micromanagement of civ, and only enjoy the exploreing and expanding (i.e. the map) then this game is not for you. When some people call it a "spreadsheet", they have a point. I still think it's fun, and theme translates well to a civ game, but it is still balancing a LOT of numbers. But that's part of what ruling an empire is, yeah?

Finally a Chvatil game I don't hate.

7th play: 8. Aug/14, 2p full. - Rating fell because of lack of conflict. Game needs some battling.
8th play: 8. 2p Adv - Again, little conflict. Adv game feels incomplete. 08/14
9th: 9. 2p Ful - One player turtled with two leaders, but comeback victory!
12th play: :star::star::star::nostar::nostar: The star is fading. The design is very tight, but I'm just not finding it fun anymore.

RATING: 9
The first game 4 of us played was a full game and it took 7 hours.  2nd game, 3 players, 5 hours.  That is a little long, although I must admit it didn't seem to drag.  We all pretty much had our turns planned by the time it came around to us.  I am told a 2-player, full game can be done in 1 1/2 hrs.  If that is the case, I would rate it higher than a 7. 

Now I have raised the rating to 9.  Each player takes an hour to play the game.  3 players, 3 hrs., etc.
This is a gruesome game if some know the cards, and others don't.  I usually do not like games where knowing the cards and combo's is a huge, game winning advantage.  However, I played this game enough to know the cards, and I play with others on pretty much the same level (although I lose), so I am comfortable with this game.  It's is a game that needs playing on a fairly regular basis so I don't forget the cards & count--doesn't mean I will play the same way, but when I know what might be coming up I have a better chance of pursuing or changing strategies.

There is a big luck factor in the cards that turn up.  I like the game with 2 (best)or 3 players because while in your current turn, you usually have an idea of some card choices for the following turn (less so with 3), and can take actions tailored to a plan.  With four players it is far less likely any of the cards on the board will be available for you on your next turn.  Just a little more chaotic, which I don't like in this particular game.  

This is the only game I play online with an opponent, (a long time friend).  In-between emails, I have a lot more leisure to plot and read the cards, and my game is improving because of this.  In fact, I now enjoy this way best.  Thank you, Joel L. in NY!

RATING: 7
A close relative to the computer Civilization game.  Micro-management with tiny glass tokens and plethora of cards with varying effect and value.  I suspect that the game grows on you after a few plays which should cut down on the long play time.  Down time between turns has to be dedicated to planning your next move as much as possible.  Otherwise, we're looking at 6  hours for an advanced game.  I was intrigued enough to try it again at some point, but I will read through the cards to make sure I know what I am sacrificing in the future with my present choices.  My first "blind" attempt was fairly successful but I'm sure the next game will be very different.  Good replay value as experience helps a lot in this game.  Especially in cracking the production limits.  The cards are definitely not balanced so knowing which has the best bang for the buck for your particular setup is key.  Will play again.

It seemed interesting, although I made a few crucial errors that hampered me during the mid to late game (not upgrading my farms and mines soon enough).  I made some classic early blunders, but overall it was a good learning game and helped me realize the need for consistently upgrading your investments otherwise your Age 2-3 stuff won't be there.

In the future, similar to Axis and Allies, I would only play this online.

Action point based civilization game that takes place over 3 different time periods

Pros
-Well balanced and well designed euro style civilization building game
-Thoroughly enjoyed the choices a player needs to on a turn to turn basis - e.g. which card do I need to take (how about my hand limit?), which cards can I play (with my limited resources), what infrastructure do I need to have in the near future (food, happiness, technology ???), and how is my military doing? 
-Some direct player/civilization interaction, and very neat political/event deck

Cons
-Long game length (3+ hours) not for everyone
-A few imbalanced/useless leaders (about 20-35% of them in my opinion)
-Very strong emphasis on military, aside from variant, encourages picking off weaker players (can lead to near elimination situations)
-After several plays, seemingly not many different strategies available (???).
-Somewhat fiddly. Hard to take back moves.

There's and endless stream of small cards that crawl across the top of the board.  You have a player board full of tiny cubes to shift around.  Why do I love it?  Because it is full of theme and history and is not math based.  It's wide open and lets you combine elements as you wish.  Its streamlined and entertaining though it looks dull.  Great game to dig into.

I really had a blast on the first few playings.  It really felt like I was building my civilization, but after a few plays I felt like I'd seen everything.  Coupled with the fact that military is so necessary, it quickly felt samey.  I wish all the duplicate cards all had a little twist to them.  It's quite possible after a few more plays here, the events will make up for it's other shortcomings.  We'll have to see.

I played this game a little early in my discovery of board games so at the time while I appreciated it, I didn't enjoy it then as much as I would today. 

This game has such a wide scope of decisions to make, and playing it is really, really satisfying. 

Unfortunately, it's also really long (though you feel like you don't have enough time to do everything you want!), not the most interactive, and has lots of bits and pieces to keep track of. So many places we missed rules and got things wrong. Also not the most interesting game to look at. All that means is that my fiance won't play it with me because he thinks civ games are much better on a computer and I don't know when I'll have a chance to play again so I can re-rate this.

Initial rating based on one play of simple version of the game.  A lot of fun, with some really interesting mechanics.  All of the fun of a civ game without the micromanagement of tech trees and army management.

My only concerns are the wait time with a full 4 players, and whether the full game will feel like multi-player solitaire (the simple version is -definitely- multi-player solitaire, but that's just fine for a tutorial.)

Must play again - wouldn't be surprised to see my score go up for it.

EDIT:  Played it again, this time with the advanced rules using the peacful variant.  It was a blast!  So many different paths to victory, and the game feels incredibly balanced.

EDIT:  Played it with the full rules - so much fun!  You really have to be at least prepared for war, even if you don't plan on going down that path.  Raised the score again - I hope this game will continue to hit the table.

Too long. Too much bookkeeping. Too many rules. Not enough theme. Not enough player interaction. Beat up on the weakest. There is almost nothing for me to like here and I think it probably deserves a one as I don't consider this one a game. To me its work. 

edit. Played three games online turn-based. Playing online helps to speed up the play time significantly and I can go do other things in the still significant down time. SO for that I upped my rating from a 2 to a 3

But the end still feels very random. The learning curve is steep. The time is long. But the biggest thing that makes this a dull game. Is the ending and the theme. After committing  a significant time investment in the game I don't feel like I made a civilization or created an empire. This is all a game of min/max.  The last game I played the winner had knights, swordman and the airforce... 

Except for wars, aggressions, pacts which come up pretty rarely (they can be devastating), this is a multiplayer solitaire at it's worst. I mean there is card drafting and you have to eye ball the table but I found that I am rarely able to block something that some.

This game is only for people that like think heavy euros. This game is not for me. I still don't understand why its ranked so highly. In truth I get the same enjoyment out of 7 wonders as I do tta and 7 wonders plays 7 in far less time then tta takes to play 2.

√â um jogo de civiliza√ß√£o. O tabuleiro serve basicamente para marca√ß√£o de pontos e pilhas de cartas. Cada jogador constr√≥i e monta uma s√©rie de edif√≠cios e unidade para constituir sua civiliza√ß√£o. No decorrer do jogo melhoramos essas constru√ß√µes e unidades. O jogo √© bem interessante e legal. O √∫nico problema √© o tempo de jogo. Muito demorado. Essa partida, em 4 pessoas, levou 7 horas. N√£o me arrependi mas n√£o sei quando terei tempo para jog√°-lo novamente. Vale apena conhecer.

You're basically only moving cards and tokens around. But somehow, even without the geographical aspect, this games succeeds impressively well in the "civ-like" genre. You could see it as yet-another engine-building game, but the effect of the cards coupled with the somewhat abstract mechanism of corruption and population just works perfectly well and you can "see" your civilization expanding or specializing. A very nice tour-de-force.

I tried the advanced version. I'm a little afraid that the full game would be too long.

2013/08/15 UPDATE: Advice! This game is really tough and heavy, a "serious gamers game", in the whole sense of the word.  Definitely not the kind of game for a casual gamers (in fact, this game represents the antithesis of the concept "casual gamer's game").

I'm absolutely in love with this "built a civilization" themed game.  Brilliant mechanics. Perfect balance between choices-risks. Very small luck factor involved here: the game result depends almost totally on your desitions, never of a bad card drawing or something like that.
Perhaps the one and only problem I have with this game is its duration, 'cause it takes at least 4 -5 hours to finish a 3 or 4 players complete game (till the end of age III/beginning of age IV).

I'm the very proud owner of a copy of the Spanish edition by Homol√∫dicus, wich includes 9 new cards inspired on Spain History (2 wonders, 2 leaders, 2 actions (yellow cards), 1 formation (militar strategy), and 2 events.

I think civilization games are dead to me. If someone had asked me I would have said my problem is dudes on a map but TtA doesn't have those so it must be something else.

To be honest, it's not really hard to see what detracts from my enjoyment here: Long downtimes with solitaire micro-optimization, overbearing importance of military advancement coupled with direct player attacks, extremely long playtime with a gradual ramp-up that makes you see the winner a few hours before the game actually ends or gives way to huge swings in the last age, and just a general tendency towards game state administration overload.

I'm baffled by the high rating of this game.  It's not a bad game.  It was fun, but not fun enough to justify its length.  I guess the length is not bad for a civ game.  Maybe - I don't play civ games much.  

This game gives new definition to the word 'fiddly' (it includes very small wood shavings that are forced to pass for tokens).  Lots of downtime in a 4-player game - I'd rate it a 2.5 as a 4-player game.  Three players was okay, though.  With the downtime and the bits and the rating drops.  It's likely I'll play this again some time, but it's too long for our regular game night, and I wouldn't want to play with more than three players.

I'm deducting a full point for the inability to correctly count to 100.

Based on a quick play through the 'Simple Game'. I can see this game would work very well with the right people, it lends itself to lots of thinking. As the simple game doesn't include military cards, didn't see how that works. Found the constant shuffling of tiny, tiny wooden beads a bit of a chore, but it's not a game-breaker, and I'm not sure how it could be improved on.

I resisted this game for years because I love Sid Meier's Civilization, and this one doesn't have a map. Oh, how I wish I could have that time back. Razor-sharp design that ensures no one strategy will ever outweigh another. This game echoes around in my head for hours after every session of it.

I received this as a gift from a friend, who then balked at attempting to teach me the game and declared that a four player game was out of the question.  Thus, it sat around for three months until I finally got the nerve to dust it off and was able to talk a buddy into playing a couple of learning games.  I'm glad I finally did - this is a terrific game - but I can see why the friend who gave me a copy was a bit dubious about having a go at it at the time.  The rules aren't so complicated as to be daunting, but it is awfully fiddly and there's a fair amount of bookkeeping involved.  And, while I'm looking forward to trying a three player game next, I'm pretty sure a four player game would be way, way too long.  That said, I'm stoked for more, if I can talk a couple of folks in my game night group into a relaxing round of Civilization the Board Game the Computer Game the Board Game.  Update: Having played a simple four player game we're ready to give 3-4 players a go on the standard game.  Brace for impact!

Vlaada sure knows how to make complicated rules systems relevant to game immersion. This is more complicated than I want a game to be, but because the rules are so thematically relevant, I enjoy it thoroughly. I would like the game to have some visual map of our empires and its parts. Scoring along various tracks is helpful for gameplay, but detracts from immersion.

All that said, in the 8 months since I have learned this lengthy game, I have logged more plays than any other game I have logged in the entire 3 or 4 years of logging on BGG. I suspect I have only played Chess more.

It is so so delicious. Every element of the game is tightly balanced with rewards and consequences. 

I have reached a point in my plays where my moves are moderately predictable. I need to shake it up, but I am not sure what to do.

Too long for my taste and, worst of all, there's so much bookeeping that it gets in the way of devoting oneself on strategic and tactic developments. If it were a computer game, it would bring some fun. But then again, it probably wouldn't be as good as other computer-based civilization games.

I jumped right into the full game.  The rules are procedural which makes it easier to get the hang of it in just a few turns.

RATING: 10
Interesting game on civilization development. 

Pros: The lack of a map seems to alleviate the usual 3 player game difficulty where the first two players to fight basically hand the game to the third player. The mechanism for worker assignment and resource consumption works very well.

Cons: 
1. Very steep learning curve. I would suggest that when teaching new players you play two or three turns and then reset and start the game for real. This would add to the length of the game but it would enable the players to really screw up once without losing their first game by a humiliating margin. A new player should otherwise expect to be in last place and to consider it a victory if he scores more than half of the leader's score. 

2.  The game defines fiddly. However the many bits used in the game are essential. I do not believe tracks, dials or cards would function properly to deal with the worker placement mechanic. Just be aware that you will screw up at least once when you play the game. I suspect that even experienced players will forget to execute one of the many steps in the advanced game.

I'm rating it on what I think it could be; it might go up - it might go down. Chvatil's games are the type that you have to play dozens of times in order to get passed the fiddly game-bits downtime, player downtime, 1000 rules-lookups, and figuring out basic strategies. I'm mature enough to say he makes brilliant games, but brilliant like Chess, which is a game I know needs careful and thorough study in order to be good at it. I like games where I do okay half way through and then learn as I go on. By the next few plays, I've got a solid handle and rarely does confusion play a part in the game. With Chvatil's - I stink like shit, then I do horrible, then I do barely good. Putting all that energy into something that you'll only be half-good at after 16 hours of play, well, that's not my type of game. I've already closed the book on some of his other games, but TtA is something I would definitely want to try again, this time bringing in the Advanced rules.

Comment update: Through the Ages Second Edition is sooo much better and fixed pretty much every issue I had with first edition. Thank goodness! It's a great game!

This is a fantastic game and I can see why as of November 2013 it is the #2 game on Board Game Geek. It is a very complex game and not for those who don't take the time to study the rules over good. It takes a few games to really get the hang of it due to the complexities of it. There are simple, advance, and full game variants. There are also variants for peaceful (non war) games. My first 2 full games with peaceful variant (two players) took well over 7 hours to finish. The full game can be very long, but with more experience players it can probably speed up quite a bit (but you have to have played quite a few games and understand how it works with leaders, science, mining, military, events, placing workers, building things, and making right choices with what's available).

After third play I've decided this is worth an 8.  The advanced game adds some nasty player interaction that wasn't there in the basic.  About 4 hours to play with 3 participants and rules explanation/review for all.  Two player is fun, but doesn't hold as much interest as with more.  For the full game figure 2 hours per player, 1.5 if everybody knows the game and plays quickly.

Edit: Even more play can drop the time per player to 1 hour or less.

I'm impressed with this game at both the advanced and full levels.  The simple level can be entertaining if you are just learning, but doesn't compare to the advanced and full versions.

With players that have at least some experience, the game seems to take about an hour per player at the advanced level, and about an hour and a half per player at the full level.

This assumes that no one is overly afflicted by analysis paralysis.  Also, players who prefer military strategies might influence this. I've played mostly with peaceniks so far.

Very initial rating after 2 solo plays simulating 2 players. Advanced rules.
Probably too long and too much of a solitaire - for me the cards saying ,,do this to your opponent" are not really an interaction.
On the very other hand - the whole game is too much about the VP's. I mean - you've got 4 sliders: VP's, military, science, happiness, but in the end - the most important is to get more VP's every turn then your opponent.
I've got ambivalent feelings. On one hand - it was quite an enjoyable experience. On the other hand - come on, I'd rather play Caylus or Brass and I'm sure TTA will annoy me in the same way Dominant Species did.

EDIT
It is annoing, it is random at times. It does make you feel like you don't have anything to do sometimes. But it is SO addictive, that I can't resist to rate it 9. Maybe one day it would be even 9.5-9.9. Need a bigger surface to play and mainly with 2. With 3 downtime is too long.

First two plays with 3 people everyone had a good time.  Played simple and advanced rules and finished in under 1 and 3 hours respectively.  I assume the full game would add another 2.5 hours on so the game length expands similarly to the number of days in Mage Knight.  There wasn't a ton of rules consulting which speaks to a certain elegance.  

The game is certainly a bit abstract as workers and buildings don't do a great job at implying the rise and fall of civilizations.  Still would enjoy playing a full game on a long patient night to try to become more efficient and focused while learning the ropes.

---- Was 8.8

Made it through a full game in about 4h with 3p.  It really flew by - this is very fun game that fills the time with a lot to think about.  The only 4h games I would consider playing these days are this and Mage Knight.

After playing a large number of 2-player games, I almost feel like the 2-player game is "solved."  Generally if a player is disadvantaged by mid Age II, his opponent can play a denial game, and it is very hard to come from behind.  That is why I lowered the rating from 8 to 7.7

I would like to play 3-players, but it's hard to find opponents who can set aside that much time for a game.

Our gaming group was really exited when we got this game because of the reviews. Sadly we are quite disappointed. We only play the peaceful version though and maybe this is why some rate it higher. We like games where you advance and win by strategic moves and building rather than beating up on the weakest player on the board. Just our preference. That aside we just can't seem to find a good flow to the game. Granted there is a lot of lines of strategy to even the peaceful variant but we always feel unfulfilled after we finish and wish we played something else. We are still going to try it again with 4 players and see if it changes. I think though it will soon be sold or traded.

An exceptional design.  Outstanding depth and replayability.  Bogs down with slow or AP players, but otherwise about 2√Ç¬Ω hours for 2P, adding 45 min a player.  Engaging throughout.  Plays VERY differently as a 2 player, 3 player, 4 player, full game, or advanced.  I have a thorough review here: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/297812

As a game system, a solid 10. As a game to play, an unfortunate 1. As BGG ratings emphasize one's desire to play, I have no choice but to give this a 3.

Quite simply, TtA is a nightmare of fiddliness and possible mistakes. In a four-hour game with just two players, perhaps one hour is devoted to actual game playing decisions and card play. The other three hours? Administrative drudgery in the form of bit shuffling and and bookkeeping. Until a computerized referee and scorekeeper for this game is developed, TtA will remain, for us, an unbuilt wonder.

User fubar awol's comments are spot on: "Take St. Petersburg and add 5 times the fiddliness, 5 times the complexity, 5 times the game-length, 5 times the card luck and 20 times the between-turn down-time and you've got Through the Ages."

RATING: 8
I can see the appeal, and why people are so passionate about it, but it is long and a bit fiddly.  Plan is to try to play several game over the next couple of months to get on top of the game and get the time down.  If it won't fit into an evening it is not going to be played.

5 games in and it is starting to come together - Advanced game in 2.5 hours is doable in an evening.  Full game in 4 hrs (3p).  Still a bit fiddly but never feels slow 3p as you are planning your turn. Only problem is if the event on your turn changes things too much.  Any AP will kill the game.  4p can drag.  One issue for some is that it is very hard to check things - did I remember to collected the culture points for playing an event?  Did I remember to pay that extra action point for my second wonder?  Did I pay the food cost?  etc

Well heck, another potentially overhyped game that was actually worth the buzz.  It's overwhelming at first and it does take some getting used to, but it is easy to see the potential in the game.  It is strange not having a map, and I confess that I sort of miss it.

Considering the cost of the game, it would have been nice if they had sprung for a little better production.  The artwork and graphic design is functional, but pretty bland.

RATING: 3
Definitely not in the Civilization class.  Our 4-player game took longer than regular Civilization (about 5 hours, which is what 5-player Civ has usually taken; 4-player Civ would be even shorter).  And there are a lot more rules than the much-cleaner Civilization. 

Still, it was interesting for one play.  No player interaction like Civilization, and I miss the geographic layout of Civilization, which really helps the game feel historic, and to have a flow (yes, I'm going to keep comparing this game to Civ). 

However, it seems like if someone gets behind in military strength, they are just screwed.  Using Aggression cards on a much weaker opponent costs almost nothing, has no risk, and yields free resources, which improves your position relative to everyone at the table.  Attacking the losing player is so clearly the correct play, it's a bit disturbing.  I suppose the answer is "don't get way behind in military strength," but that's not really a good answer.  The game should provide some incentive to attack the leaders, not the trailers.

Way too much down time. There seems to be an opposite attack the leader effect here that focuses on attack the weak player. The pieces are way too small and fiddly. It is basically an economic engine game plus a bunch of special ability cards. For what it is, it does it well. There is even a reasonable amount of interaction through the political phase, which is usually lacking in economic engine games. The downtime really killed it for me though.

Definitely a leading contender for best civilization building board game.  On the longish side.  Nice quality, but small, bits.

To do well and or enjoy playing this game one must study this game like it is a college course; Scan the rules, Read the bold headings and first sentence, Look at and read the examples, Read the instructions from start to finish.

However, many at my Game Night enjoy this game very much, they have just about worn the ink off of the cards.

I will probably keep this game as I love complex civilization games. I have an appreciation for the design of this one.

The bad: The rulebook is a wall of text. This game is only for hardcore gamers and takes several plays to learn. As a result it won't see much play time for a lot of people. It's also terribly fiddley and I can't understand why someone picked tiny disks for counters. They are truly awful. All the components for this game should be bigger.

One of the best civ-building games I've played and the closest to the computer version.  This game is outstanding.  The only thing preventing me from giving it higher is the amount of upkeep and fiddling with bits required and the amount of luck in the order the cards come out.  Certainly, these are two very minor issues, though, and shouldn't stop anyone from trying this once.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the game, though even the full game feels like it ends too soon - just as the best technologies are being drawn from the deck, but before you can get a return on them (or even get many into play). I seem to have more tolerance for long games than most people, YMMV. Downtime may be the games largest problem. If you aren't inclined to idle socialization during other players' turns you probably need to bring short filler games to any four-player game of Through the Ages.

However, I will not even consider buying (or trading for) the error ridden and overpriced FRED edition, which is short on components to boot. In addition to the typos and layout errors, the second edition doesn't include pact markers and there aren't enough cylinders for even three players in a full game, let alone the four specified on the box. It is unfortunate that Fred Distribution's poor QA and business model may mean there won't be another edition, but I won't subsidize incompetence or price gouging just because they scored a good license. Perhaps another importer will pick it up in the future, or perhaps Fred will learn from their mistakes. Until then, its similarity to the digital Civ series makes it easier to play that instead.

Absolutely outstanding game. I am a huge fan of Sid Meier's Civilization franchise and this captures the essence of that perfectly in a card/board game. I am looking forward to future plays, and hope to teach more people how to play this game. The game-play appears complicated and there is alot to keep track of initially, but after a few turns it becomes clear that the designers built a great means of tracking everything on the player boards. Can't wait to play again!

Opinion: this is a game I like a lot, and I would like to like more. The theme is awesome, the pace of the game is amazing, but I am lowering the rating the more I play it. How you develop your civilization is really lovely, really strategic and, probably, a bit static (you do not have many options to change any strategy rapidly).
On the other hand is the war affair, do not get me wrong, I like the idea of a cold war, that you have to follow your opponent quite closer, besides that, how it works is very disappointing for me. No matter you do not want to go to war, you have to go if your opponent goes to, other way you are out of the game, the effect of wars are very annoying as you can be out of the game after 2 or 3 hours playing, and, if you want to be in, you have to play one way you do not like to. Moreover, once you have suffered a disaster like this, you can be the target of more wars or aggression... you know who to hit if you are playing and see a weak player.
I like the game, but the implementation is not my cup of tea, if I have to play the way others want, I prefer shorter games

Through the Ages is the best civilization game I've ever played, and it's not really even close.  Eliminating the map was a brilliant decision, circumventing many of the design problems that plague this genre.  The game presents tough decisions, it rewards planning, it resists stereotyped strategies, it excites, and it leaves me wanting to come back for more, again and again.

I'm especially impressed with the military system in Through the Ages. There are many ways that this could have gone wrong, but it's handled so well that it becomes one of the game's principal strengths. The military arms race regulates the pace of the entire game. Players who lag or procrastinate in their military development can get ahead of the curve in others ways, but they risk total ruin if they get too greedy. The military actions keep the game in balance, thwart the "perfect" optimization strategists, and allow an aggressive player to have a tremendous impact on the game.

This is really a great board game version of the PC game Civilization. I really love it, but it has two major flaws, which brings the rating down 1 point each: Too long and Too fiddly. The icons are unfortunately not so intuitive as I had wished. I've tried it just once with the full rules and 4-player. Probably is the game best with 2 players, but then you can't use the pact cards. In any case I've bought the new edition.

After playing it over 10 times, I increased the rating to 9. But I always avoid to play it with 4 (then I would rate it 6) and prefers playing it with 2, as the time is normally less than 3 hours.

Replaced by 4th edition, which is better.

This was a very cool game. We played it 4 player and I guess it is best with 3. I had a bit of a tough time remembering what to do with my resources in order to purchase things every round.

It is my favorite civ-type game currently.

The event deck can be frustrating when you place knowing that based on table-plays there's a 1/5 chance of being shafted, and yet it happens. The earlier in the game it happens, the stronger the butterfly effect is at the end scoring. Ag and Ore tech can be poorly distributed in the main deck (all towards the bottom, or 1 at the top [for one player only] and the rest at the bottom in a worse scenario). Going last is just strictly worse than going second, which is strictly worse than going first. If TTA was a 30 minute game, these faults wouldn't hold it from being a 10, but the game usually takes anywhere from 180 to 225 minutes with some considerable down-time. In spite of these faults, TTA is still a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Since I love civilization building games this was a no-brainer for me. There is both a sense of development and the struggle between specializing and balance. This is more of a civilization management game and less of a world domination. War is present and important in the game, but the most interactions are more indirect. That leads to a game where you try to build your engine to come ahead the other player, while still not being too vulnerable to what other players does to you. I sense that there is a pretty good replayability, but with time I want an expansion to the game, to stir things up.

I don't see me playing this game very often. It takes a lot time, but it's worth it. A large variety of possible strategies and every game is different. The game pace moves along suprisingly quickly but it is still a long enjoyable game. There are so many cards and nearly endless variations of play with many roads to victory to explore.

Played 3+ 2,3,4 players. The 2 player game was to learn the rules. My one full game was with 4 players. I say full game but it was abandoned after a little over 4 hours when we could see we were only half way through. Through the Ages is way, way too fiddly. The concentration needed to track everything is more effort than fun. It is nice watching your empire develop but it satisfies few of my requirements for a good game. The down time is more extreme than in any other game I own, the guy at the back militarily is having no fun getting whipped turn after turn and regularly players are going to be knocking over their tiny pieces causing exasperation all round. Through the Ages stole my much anticipated, once every 6 months, 5 hour gaming session. For that I give it a ‚Äú3‚Äù *UPDATE* Played again this time with 3 which is the only number I would now be interested in playing this with. It could well get played in another 6 months but only because I have access to no other games which will fill a 5/6 hour time frame with 3 players. It is so fussy, I promise you that at several points during the game the little cubes are going to get knocked and the players will be looking at each other trying to guess whos marker was where on the score track or which cards had what yellow cubes on them.

Interesting game. It certainly has a very steep learning curve. 
I thought I was supposed to shout: "WOW What a game!", but, no, that is not the case, for now.

UPDATE
Ok second game. This is an unforgiving sucker, you can easily get drawn in and have a hard time coping with all the demands your civilization needs. You need to plan things ahead and be very careful with what you do. 

A good thing is that you play for a long time, and during the course of the game you may have time to get out of the loop and play on your strengths. 

Do not ignore the military, if you do you'll be out of the game quickly.

Ugh. I'm losing my grasp on this one, and will probably trade it soon. Any game that takes this long to play, and is based on amassing a little, private engine, means that there are two types of players: the initiated, and the tin cans. I don't think I can get together the initiative to go from one rank to the next. Plus, it's ugly as sin.

many possibilities, funny game, you have to think all the time. 
But the manual is bad. The stones could be better, they are not staying on the board. You have to shift the stone so many times. There is no interactions, the wars/ aggressions are far too weak. And my last point: you dont have any civilisations, that changes your whole game -> so the basic strategy is the same for everyone, the first rounds are almost the same.

Really wanted to like this.  Played friend's copy which he'd just purchased with a gift certificate.  Copy had some glaring problems.  Have to wait and see if FRED customer service will fix his problems.  Sadly he bought 1st edition, unaware of the problems possible and the new edition to come.  That's why I tell them to do their research.  :)

Rating may hopefully improve with future plays, thought I'm in no hurry to try again.  Our first play was rough.  We really like Civ games, and we liked their Roll Through the Ages, as a nice dice game with flavor.  Going off name recognition alone, he bought sight unseen.  It's possible we didn't have the rules down correct. I and another are the usual game buyer/explainers and didn't want to push him aside as we're trying to nurture a new game Hoarder.  

I really think there's potential.  I don't look forward to playing, but I'll keep an open mind and might ask to read the rules first in case there WAS a problem.

Update: I have increased my rating to an 8, simply loving the two-player-game. For three and four players, I would rate this 7 and 6.5, respectively.

Having played many two-player games lately, I am convinced that this is indeed one of the better games to arise in recent time. The Advanced and Full game play very differently, which I like a great deal. A must-buy for anyone looking for a heavy, and I do mean heavy, strategy-game. 

Not for a group prone to Analysis Paralysis.

RATING: 8
After one incomplete play: I like it. There is a lot of depth and variety. 
Pros: 
Very interesting decision tree
Great variability in the game and play styles
Lots of options

Cons:
Length
Very fiddly (too many bits to keep track of)
Rule book difficult to use as a reference

The cons, though annoying, do not take away from the excellent game play. I expect my rating to go up after more plays.

This would be a fantastic game for online play.

UPDATE: Played a complete Advanced game finally. I still agree with all the Pros & Cons listed above, but the game is very engaging. Despite the length, it feels like it is just rushing by. It takes so long to develop your civilization, and just when it gets going the game is over (with the Advanced game). Maybe playing a Full game would mitigate that. Sadly, I don't know how often I'll get the chance to play.

Great game, through it can start to feel like solitare after a while.  This game is also very unforgiving.  One bad choice in an early turn can sink any chance of winning.

Update: Rating down from 8: Halfway through the 4th time I played this, I realized was not having fun anymore.  It's charm was worn off.  It's fiddy, has very little interaction, and is too long.

The game is getting better from play to play. A lot of different things to do, different strategies to explore, different combinations to try. Solid game, great idea. Most of my plays are 2-player games in which I still try to find a way to build a decent military civilization.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A good civilization game, but it is not that good when playing with more than 2 players. 3 Players, alliances are a not fun since you can either have 3 alliances and no one attacks each other or it is a 2 vs 1. In a four players + game, what happens is while you play your turn, everyone else is falling asleep because the player is inactive and has nothing to do... especially the guy that just did his turn before the current, he needs to wait three turns before he is allowed to play. That is a huge downside of this game. 

Another downside is that one edition came with super tiny blocks of wood that required thin nimble fingers to manipulate.

The good side is that you don't have a map where you move tiny pieces and takes room. Everything is abstracted.

Overall, it is a decent game worth buying if you can train people in playing it. Otherwise, stay away from this one, it is way too long to play with a large group since you do nothing when it's not your turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game employs very interesting worker placement mechanisms; keeping track of one's population and resources is implemented in a surprisingly smooth and elegant manner. This aspect of the game has considerable strategic depth and is highly enjoyable.

What bothers me somewhat is the fact that the players' choices of moving their civilisations on to new technologies/ideas are determined by the development cards that are available. While there is a look-ahead factor involved in this aspect of the game, there is really no telling what cards will actually be available when it is your turn. 

This can result in situations in which a civilisation is nicely developed and ready to move on to new ideas, but there is just no interesting idea that is worth being picked up, and thus the civilisation stalls, whereas a badly struggling civilisaton is just lucky and has the opportunity to pick up instant VP cards or the badly needed bonus card. In particular, lucky head starts by means of strong leader cards are somewhat hard to catch up. 

Nonetheless, this is a really entertaining game with strong mechanics.

Best civilization game I have played. A much better feeling simulation of the PC Civilization game than FFG's version.  Playing time is going to be tough to sell to the new short attention span gamer or those who just don't have 4 hours to spare for gaming.  Well worth taking the time if you have it, though.  Highly recommend to those who can handle the play length and like civilization building games.  Play 7 Wonders with anyone else.

Bought this on sale because of its reputation and comparisons to Nations. It is a good game. I think it is incredibly overrated. The rules are obtuse, and seem almost arbitrary at times (corruption, for example, a very confusing concept.) Nations does everything here, but clearer, more direct, and shorter. Again, a good game. But, I think that if Nations came first, this game would not hold the reputation that it does.

good civ-type game.  played first game (advanced - 3p with 2 newbies who both can be slow players) in about 4 hours but stayed engaged the whole time.  enjoyed it quite a bit.  avoid if you require player interaction or don't like long-ish games.
2008-01-26 - played a second time - again 3p all experienced - 3hrs.  had forgotten a lot and needed refresher on rules, but.  the way the bits keep track of production was confusing at first, but does the record keeping, including famine and corruption, in a nice streamlined manner.  still may feel compelled to get a copy but shouldn't.  the only person i'm likely to play with already owns.

I was fortunate enough to find someone at a con to sit down for a bit and teach this to me. Unfortunately, we did not play the last era, so I did not get a complete game in. I did though get a good feel for it and think I do like it. I'm not sure about the 'military' aspect of it. But, I figure I'll catch on to it after a couple plays. Probably should get between a 7 and an 8 from me.

Hardly fiddly at all, and the length of the game has been exaggerated. Very open, with lots of routes to victory. Thematically, I find it rather weak--but it scratches almost all the other epic itches. Mechanically, it's awesome, and the tension ratchets up with every subsequent age. A high water-mark for game design.

Oh well... while this game has some fun aspects, it lacks in game play and takes way to long!

It really is fun to build everything up and use the few of everything you have (or not), but all this at snail speed.

I don't like how the combat works, I actually don't like the whole card mechanic in this game. There's so much luck involved, in a game that takes ages and like this wouldn't be enough, you may be pretty much out of the game early and stick to it for a few more hours.

And than there is the worst rule I have EVER seen in a game... you can just quit the game instantly, canceling a war so that the potential winner doesn't get anything for all his actions. What the fuck where they smoking?! If a player decides to quit, fine, but then it should be on his own turn only or give the attacker what he deserves. Uhm... the game should get a 1 rating for this stupidity alone.

RATING: 9
1 play, advanced game, 3-players.  It's very fiddly (meaning it takes a lot of manual manipulation and bookkeeping); if that bothers you, then look-away.  Otherwise, it's a wonderful abstraction of a civ game into an economic engine game.  The civ aspect is mostly thematic, as you are indeed building a single economy rather than building up an empire, but this is necessary due to the removal of any sort of geographical maneuvering.  There are wheels within wheels, and many aspects to balance.  There seems to be multiple paths to victory, and I like the way the leaders shape your strategy.  The pact cards add a very cool diplomacy element.  It seems like the Advanced game leads to unbalanced cards and strategies since certain combos aren't given time to develop, or are active for too great a percentage of the game.  A bit long for the full game I expect, but the time flew by in our 3.5 hour advanced game.  There can be a lot of down time, but that seems like it will improve with further play.  Hopefully the reprint will make the bookkeeping easier, as the little gems - while cool - are too hard to manipulate, and you'll be doing a lot of it.

The simple game is quite bad. There is no combat and thus little interaction with your opponents. Also, the tracks are quite fiddly. We are going to try this with the full game next. I'm sure my rating will improve then.

The full game is quite long. The pieces leave a lot to be desired. You have tiny dowels (3/16") used to track your workers, food and resources. These are simply too small. They roll all over the place and are difficult to use effectively. The game would be about 30 minutes shorter (and much more enjoyable) if it had components worthy of a game of this high rating.

RATING: 9
I need more plays before giving this a 10 but for now I would always try and play it.

None of the negatives hold water for me:

1. Sub par components - they do the job just fine and the art has a charm of its own.

2. Long playing time - that's a group not game issue

3. Long downtime - not really if players play efficiently and avoid excessive AP

4. Fiddly - Not more than many other games

5. Runaway leader/ hit on the weak civilisation - Sure if you play badly and lose the game as a result. I want that not some pointless catch up mechanism for bad play.

6. Unbalanced - Everything is about managing resources in an optimum way. There are many ways to do this, there is no imbalance.

7. Not enough actions/resources/always feel left behind - welcome to a resource management game and it applies to everyone. This has to be the silliest accusation I have seen.

8. Wars and aggressions too easy/hard/imbalanced. No, the mechanics for this are subtle and it is all about trade offs and opportunity cost. Seeding the event deck is a great concept to ensure some tension and uncertainty. The threat of aggression or war can be more important than an actual aggression. Any player that ignores this will suffer.

9 Boring game -sure, it will be for some. We all have our own preferences. I love to see how my Civ develops over time and getting rewarded for earlier decisions or punished for them too.

I picked this up in trade at Essen the year it was released. It looked really exciting and I played several times. Each time things dodn't quite gel so we tried the next, more complex version and got the same result.

In the end after several plays and developing a feeling that the game too far too long to play for the level of player input plus had too much downtime I decided to sell my copy to someone desperate to get one just ahead of the reprint.

Despite a several opportunities to get the reprint at a discount I have not replaced it in my collection and suspect I never will.

So nearly a great game.....

RATING: 8
First game with three players, of which two were newbies, took us 6 hours. I didn't check the time even once and if someone had asked how long it took, I'd probably have answered something like 3 hours. It's that good. You have some hefty turn-angst in this game, but it feels like you have tons of options and directions and they all are positive. Compare this to Cuba or Year of the Dragon, where you have only few actions and none of them seem to dig you out of the quagmire you're slowly sinking in... Production values don't meet the outstanding gameplay, the publisher is shooting itself in the leg by hiding the rules and keeping the price quite high and there are still typos and errors even after all these printruns. I would really like to slap their wrist for this kind of behaviour by not buying this game, but I'm honest enough to admit to myself that I would break down and hand over the money, if my friend hadn't already done it. And I still might...

Edit: Yep, I did. But I had to sell it again, because one of my friends wanted it really bad. And I'm considering of buying it again, even though there are at least four of them in our gamepool.

Fascinating game of balancing four or 5 different intertwining resources.  If you don't have enough food, you can't get enough workers, and if you don't have enough rocks, you can't deploy your workers as buildings or military units.  If you don't have enough happiness, you're effectively limited in how many workers you can deploy.  If you don't have enough actions, you can't draft as many technological advancements or other useful cards, and if you don't have enough science, you can't bring your technology cards into play.  And on top of it all, there are VPs (culture points), which are all that matter in the end!

Sadly, the first game that I played demonstrated that if you are far behind one player in military, then you're going to get attacked by him, and when you lose that battle, you're going to be attacked by all other players on every turn for the rest of the game, because they all get benefits at your expense.  So make sure not to fall behind in military units, because this game definitely rewards  a "kick the loser and avoid confronting the leader" strategy!  The fact that such a strategy exists annoys me.  I much prefer Advanced Civilization, where it's more profitable to attack the larger civilizations, because they have better commodities to steal.

The first game I played took 5-6 hours for 3 players; I hear that it takes about 3-4 hours once you know the game well, but I've played it a handful of times, and it always takes much more than that, because I take too long to decide (and because I'm not familiar enough with the game and the record-keeping required).  This is another game, like Advanced Civ, that could seriously improve with computerization to handle all the micro-management and speculative analysis.  Ironic, since this board game seems very inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization computer game...

My first game of this was painful. I spent more energy trying to figure out how to play than actually playing. The second game was much easier, but still cloudy. There are many interacting parts in the game. Your civilization is an efficiency engine made up of a bunch of smaller efficiency engines (farming, military, politics, mining, religion, science, etc). These are all difficult to build and balance, but the game throws a steady bunch of wrenches into all these works so that holding the civilization together is tricky. In my third game of this I was able to keep on top of the gameplay more or less, play a bit quicker, and think more about a long term plan for the game. Overall I like the game. It's long (4+ hours), but the arms race is quite exciting, and the game has produced some nice surprises.

This is a card based game of Sid Meier's Civilization (certainly feels like it!).  If you enjoyed the PC version, there is no reason not to like this one!

The game flows well, but the full game takes about 6 hours to complete.

Seems to suffer from the runaway leader problem, as in a 3-player game our scores were close when around the 90 point mark, but the end was... well see for yourself:

238, 175 and 159

Still trying to understand what went wrong and why such a large point spread.  The person in the lead was ahead in every field, something which felt rather odd.  Perhaps she just had better card selections, as none of us lost a turn switching Gov't types, yet the spread between 1st and 2nd was 63 points (~30%), and with last it's 79 points (or ~50% of his points!?)

RATING: 7
Simply wow. This is -the- game of civilization-based micro-management. While I recognize that this is either a huge "turn-on" or "turn-off" for many, whether it be the word civilization or micro-management that does it for you, this achieves what it sets out to do in spades.

This game provides mounting tension, as well as a resource race, and a bevvy of difficult but meaningful choices. While I have only played the Advanced game so far, I can only imagine the game escalating all the more so into a bonus-scoring arms race at the end. The card track, while nothing terribly new (even at the time) provides an interesting way for technologies of various sorts to increase in efficacy at a slow and steady pace -- while the consumption and corruption mechanisms prevent you from the excessive rush that is often encouraged in other games with economic structures. The military aspect of this game is, as the designer states, not blind aggression but rather a subtler system which you do not need to continuously build armies but if you do not ramp up your military, you will find yourself too weak to resist direct aggression or take advantage of very desirable colonial opportunities.

As a note, it is also a difficult game to teach, and my first teaching/learning game took time -- I can imagine that once everyone understands the basic mechanics, and can take care of their end-of-turn board management that the game can speed ahead at a much more reasonable pace.

Advanced Game. Great, player interaction and everything. I want to play this more but there's a lot to like about it. My only criticisms would be the length and my feeling that there are similar games that do the same thing better (nations). 6.5/10

Full Game. I'm keen to play. Looks like more of the same above and length was already an issue. Expecting 6/10

This is based on one play of the "short game", which is really meant to be an introduction to the mechanics. These are my first impressions...

Theme?! What theme? It's a freakin' spreadsheet!!! More fiddly than Antiquity, what is the fun in shifting a bunch of teeny-weenie wooden cylinders on some process flowchart in multi-player solitaire?! (breathe, breathe...) So I'm gaining technology points and culture points... big freakin' deal! (more deep breathing...) I was bored out of my mind while waiting during the interminably long turns, that I longed for the sweet release of death represented by the end of the game. (End rant)

The historical flavor seems to be forced with notable historical figures popping up in the linear card queue, and development is somewhat dependent on what shows up in queue. Population, food, resources, technology, and culture are highly abstracted to the point where I have no attachment to the gameplay; I'm simply collecting more blue and yellow cylinders to optimize my "engine" to collect more cylinders to turn into technology or culture points. There is no "board", so there is no expansion, area control or majority, like in some other civilization games, and in this vein reminds me of Phoenicia (a design I dislike), which seems to be a super-stripped-down version of TTA. I realize that I am not forming an attachment to this game because it has no visual appeal whatsoever, unlike Antiquity, Antike, Age of Renaissance, Civilization, Rise of Empires, or La Citta. (End second rant)

When playing a civilization game, I have been spoiled into expecting some kind of technology tree, but this is not immediately apparent in TTA, as it is dependent on what cards show up. Thus, the focus on collecting unique cards from the queue reminds me of Innovation (another recent design that I dislike), so this isn't doing it for me. 

I hear that the full-version should include more player interaction, with warfare and such, but that it is progressively longer to play, clocking in at four to six hours for a 4P game. I suppose I should be willing to give it a try before passing judgment. I also probably need to get up on the right side of the bed of the day I play this again. :-) It's a '6'.

Update (07/04/12) It's coming up on a year since that first play. With the exception of Prophecy, I have not enjoyed the handful of games designed by Chv√°til. On the other hand, since I am now enjoying longer, more complex, epic games, I may have to revisit this with a proper "learning" game; I may even grow to like it. It has happened to me before: Antiquity and Age of Renaissance come to mind, where I didn't care for either of those two designs (but the aversion wasn't as strong as for TTA). For now, it is still a '6'.

RATING: N/A
Okay, I guess.  My one and only play so far was with enthusiastic experts‚Äîstuff happened, and then it was over, and my score was tiny for some reason.  Not really hot to try it again, though I know next time could be different.

[size=7]NOTE:  The following issues are entirely my own and do not reflect on the others who taught and played the game; they were kind enough to include me and any inability to get more out of the experience is my own fault.

The above session highlights why I don't like learning new games out of the blue at game events:

1)  Unlike most on this site I don't consider myself good at games in general, and much prefer to read the rules ahead of time, then get a couple learning games under my belt before I'd even dare to think of myself as worthy competition.  A 30-minute hodge-podge of verbal rules salad just means I know enough to function as an idiot tool for the savviest players, or at least gum up the works real good.

2)  There was a definite clash of play styles here; I much prefer emergent narrative and hilarious storytelling, not quiet contemplation as cards are flipped to the occasional soft grunt and nod.  I get it that for most gamers it's the mechanical stippling of the gears as they roll through time that's the thing, but I'm compelled to connect those dots and create a unique story, a memory of the game experience that goes beyond "we played and so-and-so won by some number of points."[/size]

Reserved opinion on this one - the jury is still out. At face value it is an almost literal translation from the classic pc game Civilization (by Sid Meyer). It feels a bit too spreadsheet-ish and over fiddly but that may be due to this being our first game.
Also I was expecting a map. Silly me.

Solid game. Wish leaders from second age didn't influence game so much, but I probably still have more to learn.

RATING: 6
Played the german version. Rating is only 6 because the graphic design is to old fashioned and illustrations are ugly (except the cover - the cover promises more than the cards and other game components can offer). For a game with a civ-theme, it appears to much focused on the mechanisms, it lacks of the real flavour, which could have been easily achieved by investing in better illustrations and graphic design. Thus, the components look very cheap to me and don't make me want to play the game.
And it is multiplayer solitaire, with massive AP, the conflict/aggression/war feels like pasted on to create the illussion of player interaction. 
My rating would be higher, if the playingtime was much lower, if the illusstrations and the very tiny wooden tokens weren't that cheap and if there was more real player interaction (if I want to play a war game, I play a real wargame).
I will play it again so, to see, if further plays will change my opinion on the game.

3 hours (2 player, more for 3 or 4!) of fiddly token and card-management but supposedly brilliant - a gamer's game.  However, 2nd edition has quality issues and not enough pieces for 4, maybe even 3 player game, although they're so hard to handle that you'll want to replace them anyway!  Not hard to pick up, and 3 distinct levels of game - basic, advanced and full to make learning easier.  Will theme have WAF?

Wow - this game has everything a good civilization game needs even if it comes without a playing board! I do not care how long a game of Through the Ages takes (definately shorter than Age of Renaissance) as every minute is well spent (as in Age of Renaissance :o) ).

There are so many different paths offered through the different leaders, armies, developments etc. that one should not forget his underlying strategy. However, the game does excuse the one or other minor player mistake and I have not had a game where one of the players felt too far behind and was not able to at least compete for 2nd place.

A must have for any fan of the Civilization PC games! Contains three 'game modes' (one being simply a tutorial), allowing for variable game length (which can be considerable at 4+ hours). If length is one of the downsides to the game, the other must be downtime (i.e. not for the ADD or those that can't plan during other player's turns).

However, this is still a game that provides a wonderful sense of building up and development not to be missed.

It literally took years but I finally got this to the table for a three player introductory game.  We played the short version, only through the end of Age I, and all thoroughly enjoyed the game.  We had lots to think about and some serious choices.  Game play went slowly as all of the cards were new to us, but the mechanics were pretty simple once we got things going.

It's fiddly & repetitive but I think it's almost worth it & can't see a way that could be improved.

It's also quite long but that suits my gaming tastes: the full games takes us 2 hours per player.

My final concern is that it's a bit difficult to pick up other player's mistakes (like taking too many actions) even though we try to play things in a strict order.

Despite those criticisms it's a clever game with a theme I really enjoy.

... and the game is excellent online since it's gets rid of the negatives (fiddly & long).

Through the Ages is a great and highly strategic game, but doesn't feel as personally enjoyable as other Civilization building games.

Not so much a civilization game as an engine game with a civilization theme. First and foremost I think this is strictly a game for 2. With more, playing time becomes excessive and there's simply too much temptation to keep attacking the weakest player which isn't much fun for them. When learning it's important to recognize some vital cards as they come down the track: Iron Working for one, certain Leader Cards and Monarchy all add a lot to the first civilization to get them in play, indeed the game really consists of opportunistically cherry-picking the good cards and ignoring the pap. This is my major complaint, the game doesn't allow really divergent strategies to develop, which cards are available on the track is very much left to chance and some are wildly more valuable than others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
EDIT: The full version of the game is indeed more interesting than the advanced.  I quite enjoy this as a complex game with many things to manage, but it's very easy to get stuck in a place where you cannot easily advance your position (i.e, lack of food).  Downtime is still a problem (and there's a limit to how much you can plan ahead when you have so many actions to work with!).  Looking forward to playing with two.

*

Lots going on here--my comprehension level is still kinda low.  I like it, though.. although the game is rather Byzantine by Euro standards it seems there is a lot here. I am reminded of Phoenicia.. and Saint Petersburg.  I suspect I will prefer the full version of the game.

I am displeased with the components however. And the downtime.  Egads, the downtime.

After a few Full and Advanced games, I can bump this one up to a 9.  I can understand the complaints of the randomness of the cards, and it can be quite painful to get shut out of that level I mine or farm.  However, there is nearly always a way to mitigate your handicap, either with action cards, or leaders, wonders and advancements that boost your deficient areas or pressure your opponents to negate their advantages.  Lots of strategy, heavy tactics and a solid basis for repeat play.  A solid 9.  Based on CBG edition.

The best civ-lite game I have played. It still takes a long time to play if you want to play it right from the beginning till the very end (the game can also be started from later ages for shorter play), but civilizations were not built in one hour so I don't think even a "light" civilization game should clock in under two-three hours. Only thing I miss is a world map, but hey, you can't have everything, and I can always play the real Civilization board game if I get unsatiable urge to move something on a board (that isn't a cube and isn't on a points track).

Una obra de ingenier√≠a l√∫dica.

Buena mec√°nica la de acciones civiles/militares (var√≠an en funci√≥n del tipo de gobierno), la construcci√≥n de maravillas (consumen muchos recursos) y la de los pactos entre civilizaciones (para que haya interacci√≥n entre ellos). Cada turno es un ejercicio de control y ajuste econ√≥mico. Contras: muy largo, acojona al m√°s pintado empollarse todas las reglas. No tiene mapa. No tiene √°rbol de tecnolog√≠as. Pierde mucho s√≥lo con 2 jugadores, aunque gana en agilidad y acorta much√≠simo su duraci√≥n.

[ENG]

A real game-engeneering work. It combines a lot of different  mechanisms without a crunch during the game: happiness, corruption, revolutions, colonization, military conflicts, culture, leaders. Long and epic. It should have two free afternoons inside te box. Favourite mechanisms: civil/military actions (they are different based on the current goverment), the wonders (they need a lot of resources) and the pacts between two civilizations (they give the game much interaction). Every turn is a tough control exercise and economic adjust. CONS: Long. Too long. And the rules are long too!! There¬¥s no map, no technologies¬¥ tree. It¬¥s no good just for two players, but is shorter and more agile than the 3-4 players¬¥ games.

Best game I've played this year, excellent civ feel to it -even has Sid Meyer as character card - superb. Loads of turns, meaning small diferences soon add up. Can suffer from excessive downtime which prolongs the speed of play to in excess of 4 hours (depending on your group). The only thing it lacks compared to the PC game is the feeling of exploration and obviously the board game has the benefit of being social and tactile. Now its been re-printed this game should reach a wider audience.

Agricola meets Civ-building and just as great (yes, I know this one came first, but I played Agricola first so sue me).  Like Agricola, Through the Ages really nails the feeling of having to do so many things but only being able to do a small fraction of them, while also adding a great narrative sweep to the whole enterprise.  I've only played the online version and am a bit hesitant to try the physical version due to the extensive bookkeeping and serious downtime issues that result from working through your turn multiple times to figure out the optimal moves.

Suggest: Enthusiastic. Although new ver. seems to be superior in every aspect, I still like this very much.

1. The brutal nature plus the tactic-card issue is annoying. Hope the new version([thing=182028][/thing]) will solve this.
2. The downtime, the game length, and possible AP make the game far from being accessible.

It's a very intriguing game. After so many plays, I still wanna this :) I love this so much that I would rate it a 9, but the game has the flaws mentioned that can not be ignored.  But still, one of the best civ games out there.

For those having played the Civilization video game, the parallels of the various mechanics surprisingly work their way well into this tabletop game. Tight action economy with inter-player opportunity cost make the "conveyor belt" mechanic of the cards more than just a shopping isle. Players can choose to pursue science, military, production, or culture directly to eventually win the game - keeping in mind neglecting the other tracks is a risk.

Looked forward to trying this one.  The game sounded fun.  And I do like the theme of the game.  Creating a civilization...shaping it through the ages.  And it does start out fun.  There are so many choices that shape everything about your civilization.  And then it continues to be more of the same.  Sliding fiddly bits from one part of the board to another and upgrading one building into a slightly better version of itself....over and over and over.  There can be a lot of downtime.  Waiting for your turn to come around again while other players finish out actions can lead to phone browsing to pass the time.  Its not difficult...its just boring.  Hours later, I'm glad to see this one go.

Nov08:  Alright, I'm done with it.  Let's spend some pros and cons time.

Pros:

Tons of variety in the cards.  You won't be able to use more than 20% of them in a given game, so there's always more to try out next time.

Plenty of resources to balance.  And multiple ways to get those resources.  Do you go high tech or just a slave army funded by colonization?

Time seems to fly while you're playing this game.  You don't really notice how many hours have gone by.

Cons:

Hours *have* gone by.  It will take multiple hours to finish any king of game.

The components are questionable.  Little discs had to be the stupidest choice ever made.

The accounting takes far too long.  In addition, everyone always forgets some part of it or their political action.

The payoff just isn't there.  And it's a little too abstract for me.  I don't look at my cards at the end and say "my, what a great little civilization".

Other games do the same thing in less time (Race for the Galaxy anyone?)

So for me, it just didn't cut it.

(Full disclosure, I played 1 2-player simple game, 1 2-player full game, 1 3-player full game, and I do mean the full 3 ages.)

Probably the best "single-deck" card game (i.e. decks are a shared thing rather than consolidated to each player), and a wonderfully rich civ game. I can't call it a 4X outright; feels far more like an engine-builder themed around a 4X? Still definitely deserves its praise.

Description: A civilization-building game, much like the Civilization series of computer games. 

Pro: Provides a complex puzzle with interesting choices while telling an epic story. Addictive one-more-turn feel. Theme and mechanics are well integrated.

Con: A little downtime with three players, lots of downtime with four players. It's perfectly suited for email play.

This is a bloody great game.

For the fun factor, I will give it full score.

The only reason that I did not give this game 10 is that the learning curve for new players is steep.

If you can get people to play with you regularly (no need to tech them every time you play), this game is the perfect 10.


The game is long but not boring. Although it took me 4-5 hours for the fist game, I want to replay it immediately after finishing the first play.

Yeah it's that great!!!

My understanding is that this is a very long game, so start just after breakfast!  It took us 8 hours to complete a 3er, since two of us were learning.  Great game, but I would give it a 10 if the tiny cylindrical parts were bigger square blocks to improve manageability for those of use with poor fine motor skills.

A brilliantly designed game, but the heavy emphasis on military and piling in on the weakest player can become unfun, especially in combination with arguably unbalanced cards such as Napoleon. Also I don't find the endgame as fun as the rest of it. So close to being near the top of this list, but these weaknesses knock a few points off for me.  (9.2) 03/15

RATING: 9
Only played two full games, but I can easily see this game going to a 10 for me. It's definitely immersive with so much replayability because of the variation in the card draw. I think it's a little too heavily weighted towards Age III, but that may be more of the cumulative effect that super strong cards in that final age. My only problem is finding players in my group that want to learn how to play as it has a number of plates to keep spinning at once.

Initial rating based on two partial plays, where people where explaining the game to me.  Both where 2 player games.  I learned alot of the mechanics.  The strategy will take much longer to get a good grip on.  Enjoyed the game alot.  Quick playing w/ two players, wonder if 4 wouldn't leave you with alot of downtime.  Initial rating will change after more playes.

Got in a couple of complete 3 player games.  Yeah I believe 4 would be a bunch of down time to deal with.  Love the game!

Played a few more times now, man do I love this game.  Downtime is the only thing stopping it from a 10!

Now I've played well over 100 times.  Great game.  Use Boardgaming online.  Do a turn and forget about it.  Eliminates the down time.  It is a card game though, if you don't get the cards you can't win.

I kind of admire the game design. The theme comes through and the military race generates great tension and interaction. It's even kind of addictive, just like the computer game. But it's *really* fiddly, I would never want to have to teach it. I've removed my rating (initially a 6) because I just don't know how I feel about the game -- I think it might be very good. but I don't want to put in the effort to finding out.

I love this game.  Playing time ranges from 2-7 hours depending on number of players and whether or not they have any experience playing it.  Every game I play with experienced players seems to be tighter and only 3 points separated 1 and 2 in one game I played.  Only negative for me is the significant amount of down time that can occur between your turns with some players but hey, you can get up and go to the bathroom, get a drink, check your email, check in with your significant other, etc. I would rate it higher except for this. One time two friends and I played two games back to back.  Total playing time approx 11 hours.  Wow, what a day!  Recently played the new third edition and think it is a great improvement over the first edition.  I like the play mat with cards fixed on them and I like the card draft board part of the main game board.  Most recently played two, two player games.  It is awesome as a two player game.

Through the Ages is a very meaty game with all the cards and the rather complicated rules but also manages to reproduce the tension of simpler, classic German games. At a high level it is very thematic, though the actual details often make no sense (e.g. an army combining ancient swordsmen with tanks). At first the game can seem too long, the rules too complicated and the number of cards excessive - but these issues fall away after a couple of plays when you have got to grips with the complexities and become familiar with the cards. Through the Ages has no major faults, offers several viable winning strategies and produces a different game with each play. It works well with 2, 3 or 4 players.

It might be long but the gameplay is quite addictive. I have to look past the intro game which I recommend never playing, or making sure that people know that it isn't actually a game as much as it is a tutorial. There really is no game there. 

The advanced is serviceable if you have 4 or a shorter time frame and 3, but he full game is definitely what I would like to play with either 2 or 3 given the time.

Am really enjoying exploring the various strategies, though some seem more powerful than others.

What an awesome undertaking, deftly executed.  This is not the much promised Civ Light.  Its is not particularly short, and it is not at all light.  That said, it is BETTER than either Civ or ACIV.  That's because this game captures a number of the clever mechanisms from Sid Meir's Civilizaiton, Computer game.  There is serious downtime, and the planning is constrained by the revolving card choices that can be vital to your turn.  Nevertheless, you don't complain because you get a feel that you are actually playing something epic, while you are playing this game.  Additionally, the game really encourages civilizations to develop along different paths.  Its something I wish were true of AH's Civilization games, but it just isn't.  If the play time were more reasonable, this game would be a 10.  As is, it is a fine game, that I will play again.  Sadly, its length will keep it from hitting the table as frequently as it should.

Great game.  Complex, demanding, with lots of  possibilites.  A key to winning is finding a tricky and narrow path of balancing all aspects of your civilization (military, production, food, science, culture, no. of actions).  For me it's hard - one of the few games I cannot truly master after many plays.

  I'm really impressed by this design even if sometimes luck or just specific flow of the game - accidentally - bears too much weight on a gameplay.

2-3 players is the best for this title.  With 4 there's way too much of downtime.

[Interestingly many concepts (or at least terms, names) were taken from computer Civilization.  In fact it feels a bit like playing this Civilization, just without a map.]

I love the plethora of options the game gives you and it rewards foresight.  Feeding the event pile can benefit everyone or bite you in the butt when you least expect it.  I can never seem to get my military off the ground, some wonders are obviously better than others, and the way victory points are earned can mean someone could win by a long shot in the first age while the other 3 hours are a futile game of trying not to lose AS poorly.  Still, it's the best civ-building game I've played.

I don't see what's unique about this game, it feels like a very generic euro to me. That in and of itself isn't a complete deal-breaker, but on top of that it drags. I'm not opposed to playing a game for 5 hours (I've found myself very engaged for the entire 5+ hour duration of every 18xx game I've played for example), but when I start getting bored at the 3 hour mark then the 5 hour play time becomes a problem.

The downtime between turns in this game is horrendous, given that each player performs all available actions followed by production/upkeep, before the next player gets a turn (compared to Nations where each player does 1 action on their turn only, then repeat, until everyone has passed before everyone does upkeep at the same time).

Despite this fact, I like alot of the mechanics in the game which i think are better than Nations. It's enjoyable as a 2 player, and while 3 player is probably the sweet spot, in order for the downtime not to suck the life out of the game, it has to be played with quick players.

I've played more than 200 games of this.

Pure genius in game design. I love the many avenues to success (and failure), the anticipating and seeding the event deck, the difficult choices on limited actions, the military escalation (that varies every game.)

Many cool "little" things. There's a card that actually rewards the culture leader -- BUT it has to be "seeded" into the event deck and there's no guarantee you'll be in the lead when it hits. AND... when you put it in the deck, you're triggering a more immediate event that might bite you.

I don't think I've ever played a game where conflict is handled so well. Aggressions and wars have impact, but they're usually not game losing. And 90% of the time you can blame yourself if you lose one.

You can learn TTA in one play; the rules are logical and nearly perfectly integrated; As with any game of depth, there's a skill curve. You have to know the cards and when they come out.

Some very basic, general strategy tips if you're new:

1) Before taking any card, ask yourself "am I going to be able to put this in play any time soon?" A hand at your civil action limit can be very cramping.

2) Technologies and resources are dependent on each other. Having the Air Force tech won't help you if you lack the resources to build one or a population to man it. And conversely, you can have tons of resources with nothing useful to build. And, oh, your people want to (gasp) be happy. Occasionally things will fall your way where one thing will get way ahead of another, but don't overlook any one area of development. --  Find alternatives to compensate for short term weaknesses (action cards.)

3) Be aware of your opponent(s) at all times. TTA is NOT multiplayer solitaire.


TTA is my favorite meaty game for 2 or 3 players. 4-p works and is fun, but things are a little too much out of your control and there's too much downtime if you're playing live.

Just the right amount of luck. Just the right amount of bluffing. Just the best civ/economy game out there.

This is a 10 on BGO, and a 9 live -- fiddlyish and upkeepy (a new word.) A small price to pay for awesomeness. :)

RATING: 8
Through the Ages is a very intriguing game.  It has a lot of depth, with lots of choices and possible strategies.  It's also very fiddly so you have to not mind moving lots of little pieces around as you make each move to mark having taken an action, moving a person, spending resources, etc.  After every game I find myself thinking about what I could have done differently and coming up with new strategies.  There's not a lot of interaction aside from occasional raids etc. so there can be a substantial amount of downtime, although I find that I have to watch what my opponents are doing quite carefully to help them avoid making mistakes (the fiddliness) and vice versa so that helps.  The theme is quite weak so it's not clear what country you are and there is no asymmetry at all between the players.  It is missing the spatial aspect of civilization games, which I miss, but it's already plenty complicated.  So overall very fun but just shy of "best ever" category for me.

* It's fun.

* You have to think.

* Randomness does not dominate the gameplay.  You can plan ahead and react to the cards as they appear.

* Your mistakes will be punished. (Not "Age of Steam" punished, but you'll feel the pain of making stupid moves.)



== Long version of comment

I missed out on this when it was released at Essen 2006.  Instead of hitting eBay, I waited patiently for the reprint.  For a year, I read everything that I could find on the game, multiple times.  I was pretty anxious for it, but I was worried that I was building it up too much in my mind, and figured I'd be let down.

It was everything I hoped for and then some.  

The reprint itself has some production issues which are supposed to be fixed at some point.  I'm not disappointed that I picked this one up though.  The reprint as-is is very playable.

As for the game, you have to maintain a balance between production, science, culture, and military.   If you overproduce, corruption prevents you from hoarding resources.  If you don't build up your science, you can't pay for upgrades.  If you don't produce culture (i.e. victory points) you can't win.  If you don't keep up with your military, your opponent can punch you in the face via aggressions, or in some cases just outright win via certain wars.

Of course, you don't have anything close to resembling the number of actions and resources that you need to pull all of this off.  It's a juggling act where you're trying to squeeze in just one more ball than everyone else.

The upgrades that you're competing for enter the game via a Dutch auction.  They start out expensive, and drop in price until someone buys them or they are removed from the game.  This mechanic is brilliant.  If you absolutely need a certain card you can probably get it, but it will cost you most of a turn to do so.

You start the game with 4 civil actions, which you use for the majority of things that you do in the game.  You also get 2 military actions for building troops and wreaking havoc.  There are several cards that will increase one or both of these action pools.  The thing that I really like about the game design is that simply pumping these up isn't sufficient to create a snowball effect.  Yes, more actions are better than fewer, but if you don't have the resource production to back those action up you'll be wasting a lot of time.

The leaders and the wonders are all unique, although there is overlap between a lot of their abilities.  Wonders have a sufficiently high opportunity cost that you really feel like you've earned them once they are built.  Leaders are very cheap to acquire, but you are strictly limited on many you can draw and play.

Military is an arms race.  If you keep up with your opponents you're probably fine.  If you let someone get way ahead, the pain train is likely to show up soon.  There are aggressions which let one player try to attack another.  It's a simple comparison of military strength, with the option of sacrificing troops for a temporary boost (and the subsequent shrinking of power after those troops disappear).  If the attacker wins, the text on the aggresion card occurs.  These take the form of stealing goods, stealing science, blowing up buildings, killing leaders, etc.

Unlike aggresions, wars can backfire on the attacker.  They can, however, be far more devastating.  Rather than simply deciding on win/lose, the amount by which you win or lose also matters.  If you have a huge military lead, wars can really hurt your enemies.

There are also colonies which can give you some nice bonuses, but at the expense of your military troops.  It's an agonizing choice sometimes to attempt to win a colony, knowing that afterwards you're going to be a sitting duck until you can build your military back up.

Fair warning for those who hate downtime -- there is some here because each player-turn is taken in its entirety.  You should be thinking and planning when it's not your turn though, which will speed things up.  My last two full games (2-players) took two hours each.  (Both were called with a few turns to play, because they were blow-outs.  Figure another 15 minutes each if we were play to completion.)

If you're just starting out, and you have any gaming experience at all, I suggest starting with the advanced game.  Use the simple game as a solitaire exercise for learning the basic rules.  Make sure that you read the rules a couple of times before trying to teach anyone.  The rulebook is a terrible reference guide, so you really want to know these rules cold before you start.

After you've read the rules twice, go read Helen Holzgrafe's excellent rules summary and errata list.  It'll likely point out a couple of rules that you missed.

Overall, the game is a ton of fun.  I love civ games, and this is the best that I've played so far.  I've only played Advanced Civ against a computer.  Maybe I'd like that one more than TtA, but who the hell knows, since it's impossible to get a group to play it.  I can actually get TtA to the table and knock out a couple games in an evening.

Complete Full Game w/ three players.  Having all played before we were able to focus on the game itself and made decent time.  My game stalled midway through the 3rd age and I couldn't take advantage of the end game events, finished second.  Time flew by and I had a great time.  Great game!  Two partial play four-player Full Games that we called after 3 1/2 hours.  The first game was very much a learning game as I got myself mired in a food glut which left me perpetually being resource constrained due to corruption, and lacking in military (i.e. I got nailed by the events and aggressions).  Second game my resource mix was better.

I am not sure if I like this game or not yet.  Would need to play a few more times to get a better feel for it.  Definitely lots of interesting combinations with cards.  I think my main problem with such a long game is a lack of board.  It is an epic game, but I don't get the satisfaction of seeing my civ grow in a way that seems cool to me.  Instead of spreading out and taking over the world, all I see are my little hard earned blocks confined to my play area.  Yet despite the criticism still a very interesting game.  Look forward to playing again.

After waiting a month I'm told they'll ship in three months??? cancel cancel cancel) [update: [b]The order was from [u][geeklist=139427]Mayday Games[/geeklist][/u]. Avoid them.[/b]]

Production quality is not as good as other games. The cards are very thin and have a noticeable curl to them and the game board does not lie flat easily. Artwork is amateurish-looking, sort of sketchy.

This game doesn't get played very often because it's a major time commitment.

I'm not sure how to rate this game. On one hand, it had very interesting mechanics and the feeling of the flow of history and the different strategies are great, but there are 3 things I really do not like:
1) The way military is handled.
2) It's too much of a brain-burner and it's really easy to make mistakes.
3) Hideous components.

I will probably update my rating (up or down?) after more games.

***UPDATE***
I often find myself wanting to play the game but I balk at the idea of building grand, complex euro econonic engine, and having it destroyed in the most boring, unfair way possible by the military cards.

RATING: 10
I never really enjoy exploring the map much in 4X games, as I generally seem to have uncovered it quickly, so Exploring doesn't really last long. I really just want to build up my civilization. This game is all about that, while still allowing me to fight over things with other civilizations. The theme is richly integrated into the mechanics, as well, which I find most impressive.

Utterly horrible game. How something so mind-numbingly tedious can end up as one of the highest rated games of all time, is beyond understanding. The game is at least 3-4 times too long for its own good, the downtime is awful, gameplay itself is utterly tedious, with repetitive shuffling back and forth of little wooden discs again and again and again and again. A game for spreadsheet fans, who like lots and lots and lots of micromanagement.

If one played only the first era, the game would even be tolerable as a sort of run of the mill engine-building eurogame, but add in the other eras and it becomes a drawn-out torture session where you sloooowly build up your engine while waiting and hoping for something - anything! - to put you out of your misery.

The total shame of the whole thing is that many of the engine-building mechanisms are actually quite clever: Management of population, resources, innovation (?) points, government types giving different amounts of actions, and the drafting of both generic and unique cards are all nice mechanisms in principle. But repeat it for 6+ hours, adding in 10 minutes (at least) of downtime with absolutely nothing to do between each of your turns, and it becomes unbearable. This is a game that could have used a developer's hand in streamlining the whole thing - ya know, cut away all the fiddly bits and expose the presumably interesting decisions underneath. As it is, whatever decision-making and thematic feel the game may have, it is completely buried beneath bookkeeping.

And don't even get me started on the awful conflict system which actively encourages attacking the weakest player at all times. As bad as "hit the leader" effects may be, they pale in comparison with "hit the person who's behind" effects. Yikes!

I can solemnly promise never to play the full game with four players again (a 1-era game with fewer players is not out of the question, though). I am sorry to say this, but this whole tedious exercise in micromanagement must rank as one of my worst gaming experiences in years.

RATING: 8
I've only played it a handful of times, but I find military disconcertingly powerful. The potential for it to just be very unfun for those who are behind is very real, because the game really doesn't offer you incentives for not kicking people while they're down.

Edit: the more I play this the more impressed I am. The military cards are still very swingy (especially in Age III), but there's so much you can do to compensate with whatever you get.

RATING: 8.5
Epic civilization building game with everything you could possibly want from such a game minus the map.

What does it model? Warfare (including armies which are stronger than the sum of their parts), raids, colonization, technology, upgrading, obsolescence, leaders, wonders, resource gathering (food and ore), corruption, happiness, population limited by food, culture, advanced government systems (theology, communism, republic, etc.) and trade pacts.

This loses a half-point (or more) because of its length. I guess it's necessary if you want to include all of the above but based on the subjective rating, I don't "always want to play it" since I can only do so on days I don't work and there are only two days in the weekend so...

First Impressions After Simple Game - We finally had a chance to play this for the first time and the simple game really wasn't to bad. It functions very well to learn the basic mechanics of the game and get aquainted with the various card types and buildings.

I'd have to say that afterwards it left me wondering how the military actions, happiness, corruption, and building the event deck would improve the game. I'm eager to play some more!

Impressions after the Full Game - Played with 4 players. I still loved it yet there was a lot of downtime once Age II and III hit. I'd still play it with 4 but would like to see what 3 would be like.

I went from "want to play" to ordering the game after having a chance to play TTA twice on consecutive days.  I initially pegged it as an 8, as the second game I played was the "advanced game", which was OK but left me wanting to finish the game, so it left a (slightly) sour taste in my mouth.  Rating would be a 6 for the so called "advanced" game, and a 9 for the real thing.

Just long enough, just involved enough, just enough interaction for a not-quite epic scale Civilization game.  Military can hurt you, but keeping up is something anyone can do, just a matter of diverting resources.  Easy to learn with logical progressions, and optimal play isn't something that will go by rote - the way others play affects what your optimal play is.

The result is the perfect bowl of porridge.

Initial Rating 9.5 (April 2011)

I¬¥m a big fan of civilization games so I had to play this but I had my reservations. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible to create a good civilization game without a board (it¬¥s a card game) but Vlaada pulled it off, he created a GREAT game and it¬¥s currently in Top 10 of favorite games. Vlaada is now officially one of my favorite game designers.

This is the first game in the top ratings that totally deserve its spot (as I think the top three are overrated). It has lots of tough decisions, offers pure strategy with little luck and it has an epic feel as you go through the game. On the downside (for some people :D) it has a long playtime, even more if you play with 4 players (I believe there is a long downtime with 4 players) and it has somewhat complex rules.

In conclusion it is a great civilization game and a true gamer¬¥s game. I recommend it without any reservations and can¬¥t wait to play it again.

Through the Ages is now my second favorite game ever (only surpassed by Dungeon Twister). I‚Äôm playing more and more online because when I play face to face I feel the game can be very fiddly with all the components and all the indicators you have to manually adjust, also it takes a long time to play it (4hours + or even more if you have analysis paralysis prone friends). Still love it and I would never say no to a TtA game :D. 

The perfect 10 for me a true gamer¬¥s game.

After 38 games I still continue to love TtA. When I read the rules they said that this is not a war game, so in my few first games I didn‚Äôt paid much attention to this and I was utterly destroyed by players with a better military. Nowadays, my games always feature an arms race fo some sort, so I‚Äôm beginning to feel that all my games play (more or less) in the same fashion. What I¬¥m saying is that having a high military is VERY important, perhaps the most important aspect of the game. 

Still I always want to play it (preferably with an expansion or two to spice things up) and still continues to be a 10 in my book.

What a tight design.  Resources are extremely limited, and there never seem to be enough actions available to develop exactly as you'd like.  Amazingly, "Civ without a map" works, as the military mechanics appropriately stimulate the growth of armies without bogging the game down in tactics.  (I love tactics elsewhere, but here they'd just needlessly complicate things.)

Downtime can be an issue with slow players, as the game forces a lot of micromanagement.  Plays best with 3, where the multiplayer dynamic is still in effect but the downtime is less pronounced than in 4 player.  Also plays very well with 2.  I suspect I'd prefer TTA best with four quick players.  However, usually with 4 players the game overstays its welcome; it really wants to be completed in 4 hours, and doesn't drill quite down in detail to where I'd want to see a 6-8 hour game.

I've seen too many games decided by who gets to pull Napoleon/Air Forces.

Just finished my third totally miserable game of Through the Ages, life is to short to play again. Card timing is everything in this game, if the right card does not come up at a time that is beneficial to you  or the wrong one does then you have no control over your game, all you can do it sit and go through the motions, the painfully slow motions, until the end.

After several plays on BGA, I have to reduce TtA's rating.  Although I still enjoy this game and I will never say no to it, I'm gettin the sensation than the military aspect of the game is slightly overpowered.

There had been games in which I wasn't able to do anything against a military escalation, and several times the game was reduced to a military race in which cultural and science generation didn't matter at all.

I hope that game designers correct these issues on the announced reissue.

Initial rating: 10,0
TtA was the first "serious" game that I played.  At the time a couple of friends bought it, we hadn't play anything more complex than Settlers of Catan.

At first we played the simple mode a few times and then moved on to the Advanced game, however we weren't able to complete a Full game.

A year later we started on sunday morning and finished it at 6:00 p.m., and it was a very good experience.  However we played with a home rule, no one can be attacked more than once each round in order to equilibrate the game.

TtA is so much entertaining because you need to try to balance all the aspects of your civilization, but you never will be fully equilibrated so in the game you need to think ahead and try to follow a general long-term strategy but at the same time you musn't neglect short-term playing.

This is a great civilisation game that takes quite some time to play. The game requires players to invest at least 2-3/4/5 hours of their  time in order to complete a "full" game. I, however, do not feel time passing while playing this game. Like the (dead) Ikea clock in my room, time seems to stand still when you're assassinating Shakespeare and threatening Newton with plunder.

I've enjoyed the computer game of Civ quite a bit. The full version of this game uses some abstract ideas to accomplish similar mechanics, in a very elegant fashion. I think the full games that my friends and I play take about 4-5 hours, which is full of interesting choices...but the only reason why this isn't a 10.

RATING: 8.5
- This is an amazing game with massive scope, however it takes ages to teach and play.
- The newer version is definitely recommended over the older version as they've streamlined it a little and massively improved the aesthetics.
- The way production and upkeep works is really interesting. You have to balance your mining+farming with science, culture and wonders. It's one of those games where you want to do everything, but you can only do half of it (or less) like Great Western Trail.
- Would not recommend with >3 players. 
- I think I prefer 3 players to 2. The way the military works, it can be easy for one player to pick on another and maintain an advantage over them. With >2 players, attacking a player can leave you open to attack, hence the game becomes more about the threat of attack and maintaining a defense force rather than an attacking force.

2nd ed./3rd printing.  A card-driven, empire-building, civilization game (w/o a map), where choosing and optimizing cards in an attempt to balance resources, people, and research is most critical.  Currently trying to find a happy medium between my son's propensity towards an aggressive military and my own preference in developing a sound economic engine.  Rating is for 2-player games, though sometimes I'm lucky enough to play an occasional 3-player.  I'm sure my rating will increase with more familiarity. 8.5

UPDATE:  Though there strangly is no area map giving this civilization game an abstract feel, the ebb and flow of supply and demand simply works and works very well... for me anyway.  The enclosed game rules are somewhat ambiguous, however, the available player aids (ddmits, gunslinger311, and jerkules) are most helpful.  9.5  

UPDATE:  Can't help myself, it plays admirably with two... 10!

RATING: 9
Although the components are sub-par, I'm not discounting the game for that as I think that ratings should be intended for the design, not the production. The components are at least functional. The design, on the other hand, is exceptional. I have a preference for games with many options that can be combined for creative gameplay. The way this game combines many complicated elements with a number of smooth central mechanics is most impressive. 

I have discounted a couple of excellent games (Caylus and Puerto Rico) because of the apparent uselessness of some of the options. While this game does have some cards that are significantly weaker than others, they can still be an advantage with a complementary card combination, and there are so many options to choose from, that it mitigates any potential design weakness.

While there are ways to get around if you fall behind in other departments, falling behind militarily can end your game early. I think as long as everyone understands this, it won't be too much of an issue, but it's a hard lesson for newbies. Also, I think this is true to history as well.

UPDATE: Sold this. Excited to get the new version. If it truly plays better, I'll probably knock this version a point or two and make the new one a 10.

UPDATE: And I did. The new version is better, but still giving this version props scoring it a "9".

Gran juego de civilizaciones, que se puede jugar en unas 3-4 horas.

Las mec√°nicas de producci√≥n/hambre y consumo/corrupci√≥n engranan perf√©ctamente, haciendo el principio de la partida que tu desarrollo sea lento y tengas que llevar cuidado con la sublevaci√≥n (y con la maldita corrupci√≥n).

Las acciones pol√≠ticas mediante las cartas militares le dan al juego un poco m√°s de sensaci√≥n de civilizaci√≥n (conquista de territorios, agresiones,...) y que no se descuide el aspecto militar.

Great Civilization's game, playing time is around 3-4 hours.

Production/Starvation and Consumption/Corruption mechanics work perfectly, your progress will be slow at the beginning and you will have to put an eye on uprising (and corruption).

Using military cards for taking policies actions will give the game a little bit more of Civilization's flavour (conquering territories, attacks,...) and will increase the civilization's strength.[/color]

Finally settled on this rating after about 15 plays or so (mostly with Advanced, twice with Full Game rules).  Positives:  has a nice feel for a Civ-building game, the card row and action points mechanisms work quite well.  From the gameplay aspect, this game is on a par with the best Civ-building games out there.  On the negative side, play time is a big issue, particularly with four players, since you add cards to the deck but remove fewer cards each turn with more players.  The components are the main reason the game can't earn a 9 or 10 in my book, as the beads are downright fiddly and the player mats are too small.  A chart tracking each player's level for each of the relevant items with a dividing line would have worked just as well and been less confusing.  However, once you get  past the fiddly bits, this is a fairly solid game.

RATING: 6
OK, I really can't see the fuss here.  None of the basic mechanisms appeal:
1. Card drafting from a row is boring.  It was dull in St. Petersburg and is actually duller here.
2. Pushing bits on and off cards is really tedious, clunky and dull.   No trading mechanic.
3. Theme is very thin - its all about min-maxing various combos of 'stuff' to win points.  That's fine in a 45 minute game but here its just dull.  Lots of micro decisions.  Ick.  Sacrifices mega-theme with micro-theme, destroying a sense of 'epic-ness' which I look for in civ games. This is a game where you 'manage' your civilization rather than 'rule' your civilization. I would much rather be a king than a bureaucrat.  So, I really found the game ... dull.  I guess I can see why some might like it but its just not my kind of game.
Update: since writing the above I have played Phoenicia, which seems to me to be a very similar game to TTA - micromanagement via pushing bits of stuff around cardboard with a similar mechanism of gaining improvements (drafting cards with declining values is a close approximation to an auction).  The two games gave me the same bored reaction but at least Pheonicia is short.
---------------------
Update.  Played a couple of more times now and raised rating from 4 to 6, but I think that's where it stays.  The game is interesting up to a point, but its ponderous with tons of downtime.  I would NOT play this with more than two players - my rating of 6 is for two players only and I can't imagine it would go up for more players.

Another update.  Stays at 6, but may go back down again.  Last game I got my highest score yet (180-ish) and did not build a single urban building - only built Iron, Irrigation and four wonders.  That's just really lame.  TTA has all of these 'options' in the game which in reality never ever get used.

Very nice game, the rules are intuitive and elegant. I love the design of the game and how corruption, hunger, happy faces requirements are embedded. I also love the fact that blue tokens can represent different values based on which cards they're placed, which implicitly reduces your corruption.

And here I thought Agricola was fiddly, lol. The game is well laid out, but there is a fair bit of accounting to be done on each turn. In our 4 player game, scoring culture points when seeding the future events deck was often forgotten. We had to go back and figure that out a few times. Some icons and comments on the individual player boards would help clarify a number of things. 

While the round tokens are unique, there is a reason games use cubes instead! And these bits are small to boot.

We intended to play all 3 ages, but decided to stop after the 2nd age when the game was clocking about 5 and a half hours. It would have been interesting to see how the game progressed, but we were getting tired by 2am. Maybe next time.

Overall fun experience with an epic feel.

Rating a seven after three plays. Through the Ages is a long and heavy game in which you are constantly trying to balance, improve, and specialize the strengths of an entire civilization over the course of four ages. If you want micromanagement in a game, TtA beats them all. The government you have (despotism, monarchy, etc.) determines the number of civil and military actions you get to take on your turn. You can use these actions to expand your population, build new production buildings (mines/farms), build new urban buildings, etc. The urban buildings might boost your civilization's scientific capabilities, or "culture" (raw points), or overall happiness (necessary for larger and larger populations). You also have to participate in a perpetual arms race, lest you become a target of opportunity (unfortunately, there is a built-in "bash the loser" mechanic in the game that can be hard to recover from if you slip into last). The leader only gets bashed if he has a weak military..., but if you invest a lot in the military, you're usually not leading in culture. 

The cynic in me wants to tag this as "Upgrade: the game." Certainly the large number of moving parts lets you feel like a magician at times, squeezing every optimal advance out of your turn. But over the course of 4-5 hours, it's too much of the same: an hour ago, my military was sufficient, now it isn't, better invest in new units, etc. As a result, the game is alternately thrilling and tedious. I always feel gorged on it when I'm done.

Update: I have not played this in quite a while, but I suspect my rating is actually more like a six at best. I should give it another try.

In the full game military strength is far more important, probably too much so. A strong civilization can gain a lot of resources and victory points by beating up on weaker civilizations. Unfortunately there is luck in being able to build your military, especially in whether a good tactics card comes out for you. These cards give additional strength based on your formations. Still the civilization building aspects of the game are really well done so it definitely offers some enjoyable play.

Just recently purchased and have only played two of the "simple Games" so far.  However, after such limited experience with the game, I can already see it's HUGE potential!  This game is amazing.  Almost everything is accounted for as far as controlling a Civilization.  It's beautiful.  
    The only draw back, as has already been pointed out elsewhere on the geek is that the number of bits that come with the game are inadequate.  I mean, you need 6 coloured cubes for each player to keep track of your various scores.  The game comes with 5?!?!? WTF?  And also the scoring track jumps from 80 to 100 in ten steps (that must represent the time travel element?).  All in all they are minor little points, and I already knew they were there from doing some research here on the geek, but annoying none the less.  When you put down $130NZ$ you expect perfection.     
   As far as the game play goes, I believe they HAVE achieved perfection!  It's just seamless. The rule book is intimidating but once you start to get stuck in, it all makes pretty basic sense really.  You just have to get your head around the fact that the cards in front of you are not buildings, they represent the technology your Civ. has developed to allow you to build those buildings.  Make sense??    
   I believe, after a few more plays and experiencing the Advanced and Full games, my rating for this will increase.

Best Civ game ever. Especially good with 2 or 3. Elegant, involving, satisfying. The agression is a good element, because it keeps you on your toes, even if you sometimes have games where there are hardly any fights. Version 2015 is even a bit better than the old version.

I love the theme, and the nature of building your empire. The art, however, is terrible and is in desperate need of a redesign for their next printing.

Playing it feels like building and expanding on your own personal empire, and while your options seem vast on each turn - trying to figure out what actions would best suit your civilization at the time is fun and interesting. Despite it's long length, I would even prefer that the game lasted longer; whether it's due to an inherent game feature, or just due to my own excitement, it seems to end long before I'm ready to give up.

War can be so devastating that I have to downgrade to 6/10. They take away the possibility to neglect military even a little bit in favour of other developments. A 132 point shift by a single war is too much.

When it's your turn to use your actions, TTA is approaching the perfect game. But then the turns of the other players start. At first you try to follow their actions. But at some time early in the game you just stop trying to understand why they only pay that amount of iron or what civilization advances they build. Better trust your fellows to be reliable and not making mistakes when taking into account all applicable modificators or fiddling around with the many small parts. Small mistakes can easily make a big difference. You just start hoping that it's your turn soon but that can take 10 minutes in a four-player game.
With the big criticisms out of the way, building up your own civilization is a fascinating challenge of micromanaging multiple dimensions of resources, production and requirements.  All players of the classic PC Civilisation game will experience pure bliss of nostalgia. In sum, I'm torn on this game. Rarely have I seen a game with pros and cons as spread as here. Ideally, this should be played online in a turn-based modus with rules enforcement. As a social boardgame experience I have to be in the right mood.
One prerogative in TTA: never be the civilization with the weakest military.

A very good game, with tremendous replayability and constant challenge.  My only grip with it is that it can be prone to a runaway victory.  And even there, that's not a big deal unless its a tournament or you have someone who insists on playing it out to see how high a score he/she can amass.  The game is a bit lengthy and can have downtime, and the overall challenge of it overcomes that for me.

Currently the favorite 2p game for both the wife and I.  We love the epic sweep, the adventure, the building. The genius of the design continues to amaze and surprise me.  

Strikes a great and thematic balance between chaos and luck vs. control. It manages to be deep and thinky but not too taxing since you can't plan your moves out with exact precision too far in advance, just the broad strokes.  I love how combat and colonization work (whether or not you should sacrifice units is a tough decision!).  You can produce the currencies of the game (actions, science, food, rocks, happiness and workers) in many different ways (technologies + workers, special technologies, leaders, wonders, government and colonies). It is extremely enjoyable and difficult to get the balance right.

Clunky.

Flawed deeply - bad production, misprints, scoring tracks centimeters from cards which must be moved en masse, mechanics that require players to shoot for efficiency but leave them unavoidably punished for doing so due to unpredicable events.  Has direct conflict that is both frustrating and unsatisfying.  First playthrough with reasonable explanation still left over six independent "Oh, I didn't know about THAT rule" situations that were extremely harmful.

This game is a relic of the Avalon Hill days: poorly organized rules, overcomplicated, too long, without sufficient depth to pay for all of its sins.

Skip unless you're a true Civ fanboy.

A great game, but the military aspects are problematic. 

Too many games come down to some player drawing complete crap from the military deck (e.g. setting themselves up for a military strategy in mid-game, and then drawing no age II or III tactics, or not getting agressions. Or alternatively just getting agressions and wars when playing as a pacifist). Rarely gets play in my group since some people got really frustrated by this.

A plethora of interesting paths to develop one's civ. Hard learning curve on the first try; however, it speeds up a lot on subsequent plays. Get someone to teach you. The "fiddliness factor" is nevertheless quite strong in the game. Calculation and re-calculation and re-re-calculation occurs often in the end game. Wars can devastate you - watch out (and don't neglect the military)! Runs a little too long timewise.

I actually rate the online implementation at 9.5 - it surpasses the board game in numerous ways.

Rating based on the simple game only so far.  I can see why many have complained about the components - those little stones can be hard to move around so much.  But the design is very impressive and surprisingly engrossing for a card game.  There seem to be so many different options.  And in my experience, the play time is manageable as long as the players play simultaneously if possible (like in Roads and Boats).  I look forward to trying the Advanced and Full games.  This was the 300th game that I have rated here on BGG.

Traded away - I'm not sure I'll be able to play a game this long that many times.

Only played the simple game so far.  A fascinating game, if you like civ games, as I keep trying to figure out good strategy.  The simple game, although appearing complex at first, is pretty straightforward and like a good appetizer delights the palette but still leave one with a desire for dinner.  That's not to say I leave a simple game feeling unsatisfied, but it really makes me want to try the Advanced or full game.

The game also seems to lend itself well to the creation of home rules or configuration.  The wife and I are considering experimenting by basically expanding the simple game as a two player by just adding more civil ages.


Update: Tried the advanced game.  I really like this, although the lack of a map does still feel a bit weird.  I still like this game, but I do worry a bit that I might just end up getting Civ and playing that when I'm in the mood for civ games.

This has taken our group by storm. Every opportunity to play longer games sees this come out as everyone's first choice. Quite easily my favourite civilisation development game. Yes, the components are a tiny bit fiddly, the rules are a little unclear around the edges and it can drag immensely with four players. This has the perfect tension over decisions while keeping the options narrow enough. It is exceptionally difficult to explain how this game excels but it really does. It is not easy to get to the table at first though. The little gripes keep this from a 10 but the gameplay is just SO fun.

Epic card-driven civilisation-building game with some complexity. Spans the ages from Antiquity to Modernity. The challenge is to acquire a collection of cards that work well together while simultaneously building a balanced economy that can support continued expansion. Hunger, worker contentment, and corruption are integrated into the core mechanisms of happiness, science, military strength, and culture. There is some military conflict, but it is abstracted and about resources rather than territory.

This game may appeal to those who don't mind fiddly games with lots of downtime. It appears to be mostly a story with less emphasis on strategy - something that doesn't appeal to me personally.

As a board game, however, I'll say "no thanks".

Shame on me for ever rating this anything less than a 10.  Brilliant.  Complex and thematic.  It does suffer from experience-biased outcomes (newer players will have a tough time competing) but if you have a group of similar experienced players this game will shine.  I will keep my original comments below when I initially gave this game a 6. 

Played this once at Gamestorm 2011 late at night.  There is definitely a steep learning curve w/ experienced players having a significant advantage and the game was not very forgiving of early "mistakes" (similar to how I felt about Clash of Cultures).  Ultimately I left the game feeling like it was a "rich get richer" game with strong military dominating other cultures and with too many cards along the line of "leader of category X get Y benefit while last of category X takes Z penalty).  Civilization games are one of my top two genres however so I am intrigued to try this again with friends and see how it plays a second time.

The only reason I don't give this a ten is because the game takes a very long time to play with more than two players. The theme here is great, and you actually feel like you're building a civilization from the ground up. With the peaceful variant, it's as confrontational as you want to make it. My wife doesn't like confrontational games, so the ability to remove the aggression and war cards without significantly reducing the enjoyability of the game is great!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
TtA: ASoC is a kind of tableau builder, but like Le Havre it has a bunch of stuff going on to flesh out, colour and complicate the core efficiency engine. It really feels like a Civilization-style game though the map is completely abstracted away.

After two 2-player games I'm giving it a 7. It seems many negative reactions to the game are related to bad experiences with 4-player games, but I would definitely like to try it with three.

Concerns include whether experience will lower playing times (it will easily take three hours with two players) and mitigate snowball effects from early mistakes or fluke events (such as falling into a population hole and being forced to neglect the military to catch up economically). Possibly the answer is to just play until it's obvious who's going to win, but it seems a little anticlimactic.

I have no issues with the components of the third edition. Play with drafted cards open and separate from your hand of military cards.

Military can be a little too decisive in the end for my tastes, but still love it though. Like all the other "Civ" games too...

[Update: a second play has confirmed my opinion of this game. The downtime is awful, and it's just so boringly unforgiving, in a different way from more intimate games like Agricola, where you always have genuine dilemmas to work out.]

Accounting 201. It's OK, and I need to finish a game before I can decide for sure how I feel about it, but so far I'm less than charmed. 

Pluses: lots of cards, no single strategy, when things go right it feels like you just climbed Everest. The player interaction is fun. It is perfectly balanced indeed.

Minuses: the rest of the time it just feels like climbing Everest. Too long. "Snap" is perfectly balanced too; doesn't make it fun. You could play this in Excel and it wouldn't change a whole lot. Too much annoying procedural arithmetic.

Based on 10+ plays.  As trite as it is to say it, for most of the game you really don't sense the time passing by.  The exception is when the player before you simply cannot decide how to spend those last remaining two civil actions - then you feel every second.  Even despite these moments, it's quite engaging.  I worry that it might be a bit routinized over time, but for now I'm loving it.

2015-06-19 - 6 - It's a game with quite strong "I have no idea what I'm doing" factor during the first play. I wasn't too impressed by it, but I'm pretty sure we could missed some rules. So my rating might change after second play. Anyway, it's a little bit too solitairish, but it's a solitaire with too little satisfaction in contrary to, for example, Race for the Galaxy or Imperial Settlers. We'll see.

This used to be a 10 and one of my favourite games (and it still kind of is), but the New story has made me reduce this. The New story is more streamlined, more clear, debugged and with much better art work. In a way this old version would deserve its own rating - an excellent game that I will never play again (as I will always choose the new version).

This is truly epic. Cards, resources, upgrading, military.. it has all the ingredients. I don't even notice the length of the game.

I have played it with 2, 3 and 4 players and I think I like it most with three. Less down time between turns and a little more control than with 4. With 2 the military unbalances the game.

Played the full version with 3 players, great first play. Looking forward to my next play. Didn't quite finish the advanced version in 3 hours, including rules and setup.
Second play 4 player, full version, played for 3.5 hours only got a third of the way through, great game, looking forward to finishing a game!
Third play 4 player, full version, played for 3.5 hours and just got into the 2nd Age cards, awesome game, really want to play the whole thing.
Fourth play 3 player, full version, played for 4.5 hours and finished! 1 ended up winning.

Still learning, incredibly difficult game to get the hang of.

Really cool, though, and very intricate and deep interactions. The most satisfying civ-building experience I've had so far, although in some ways I do prefer the art and theme of Sid Meier's Civ more.

2017 update: Have been playing many, many games of the app, surprised to continue finding depth after the big increase in iteration rate. Still think it's a great game. I see some of the weaknesses now--the randomness may play a larger factor than is ideal--but still a beautiful whole.

Updated after solo play of full game.  I loved the old Civilization and Sid Meier's computer game.  This is the boardgame that captures the feel of those old games in a fraction of the time.

Initial rating based on solo play of simple and advanced games.

Challenging game to learn.  It pretty much is a board game version of Sid Meier's Civilization computer game with everything, including happiness and corruption based on your whole civ, not each city.  The march of time is captured by the mechanic of removing cards from the left side of the board each player turn, which requires careful planning of limited actions.  There is a lot to like in this game, and it will take many plays to figure out which strategies are successful (and that may depend on the order cards become available).

A few more plays, and I'm still lukewarm on it. I think I want it to be good, but there's just so much that can go wrong that doesn't feel entirely within your control that I'm not sure that it is.

I think my main problem is that three random military cards a turn just isn't enough to get a good selection of those available, and with the pasting you can suffer if your military isn't up to scratch, that level of randomness just isn't good enough for a game of this length. I wonder if there was ever drafting for military cards too - it'd seem to make a good deal of sense.

---------------------------------------------------
Only one play so far, but the game seems interesting. I like the way you have a pool of resources and population that can be increased to help corruption or food consumption. It is very unintuitive though, and I'm not sure I appreciated having to spend a 4 hour learning game to realise how to even begin to play properly.

The other diappointment is that what you do in the first two ages doesn't matter too much; it's all just setting up infrastructure ready for age III. It feels much more like an economic engine game than a civ game. I'd much prefer if there was the chance to score equal amounts of culture in every age, so you have to concentrate on it for the entire game rather than just building it all at the end.

Sid Meier's Civilization computer game comes to wargames! This is a great game for four players that simulates different civilizations trying to be the first to gain new discoveries, inventions, ideologies, and religions. It forces players to invest in both civilian and military technology; those who ignore the latter will suffer greatly. It is also a long game, about 4-hours in length. TTA has now become my second favorite Civ-type game. Only 7 Ages beats it out. Recommended.

Initial and partial play only.  Seems like a very demanding, yet good game.  Long.  Seems worthy, although the odds of me ever playing much of this seem low.  The crude design is a negative, and the hype serves as a barrier.  My interest in pursuing in this game is low, thus the low rating.

No llegamos a terminar 1 partida por tiempo.

Tienes que ir desarrollando tu civilizaci√≥n con mejor sistema de gobierno (que te puede dar m√°s acciones civiles y/o militares, as√≠ como m√°s cartas en la mano y m√°s cantidad de trabajadores por recursos), mejores formas de recolectar recursos (alimentos y piedras), cultura, ciencia, potencial militar (para poder atacar, defenderte o ganar los eventos), construir maravillas y obtener l√≠deres que te dar√°n ventajas.

Lo malo es que es un juego muy largo, pero me gust√≥ el juego. Las cosas que puedes hacer son realmente escasas para lo que quisieras, porque siempre al mismo tiempo que quieres ir jugando lo que has conseguido en turnos anteriores, tambi√©n quieres coger nuevas cartas y muchas veces faltan recursos para construirlo todo.

A pesar de ser tan largo, no me importar√≠a jugarlo de nuevo y terminar una partida. Y eso dice mucho del juego, ya que no me suelen gustar juegos de tanta duraci√≥n.

Really mixed feelings on this one. It has nice and simple mechanics that evoke the feel of running a civilization. The big problem is that C:TTA is too gamey. You can win the game by making a combo that will work for several turns giving you a huge advantage in victory points. This has nothing to do with managing your resources well. You might be great at minimizing corruption, making your citizens happy, building army, but you will still fail if you don't build churches and some of the wonders.

EDIT: After playing some more I see that above problems disappear in full game. Rating up.

Played up to the end of the 2nd age with all the rules but did a lot of ruling mistake. Long but worthwhile game with the right players. Still, great game that feels different from the computer game.

This one has a white box approach: you see very precisely what your opponent is doing unlike the computer and console versions which are mostly black box. Consequently, one doesn't obsolete the other as tactics and strategies are going to be very different.

Incredible game, awesome and very balanced mechanic.  The hours spent on balancing the cards and gameplay must have been astronomic.

It's only bad side gameplay wise, and why I give it a 9.5 instead of a 10 is: you always want to play another game, but at 5 hours a game, it's difficult to find the time.  And it's other bad side, not related to the game itself, is it's price.( I think the latest printing got a more reasonable price)

I'm not very good at it but so far, this is the best game I've ever played.  I have  the 3rd Fred edition, the 2nd Rebel edition, the 2nd Mindok edition, and the 4th Iello edition. Out of about 40 plays I don't think I've ever won with the same card combination twice.  I've used about 80% of the cards (buildings, units, govts, wonders).  There are so many things to think about every turn.  It's easy to miss something.  While I do like maps, I also like the minimalistic aspect of this game as it fits easily on my small table.  This is a game of grand scale; you are building a civ from ground up.  If you are good at gambling on probabilities, you will do very well in this game and win more than your fair share.  I typically play once a week due to time constraints.  It's a 3 or 4 hour game with 3 or 4 respectively.  Sometimes, 3 players is only 2 and a half hours though.  If you experience AP, stay far away from this game as it can turn into an 8 hour snoozefest.

RATING: 10
Excellent epic complex card-driven civilisation game. A whole range of concepts have been nicely integrated into the main mechanisms: happiness, corruption, revolutions, colonization, military conflict, culture, important or remarkable leaders, ... Resources and technology points are more important than food to progress with your civilisation (other civilisation games tend to have a more acute shortage of food). The game components are rather tiny and should have been bigger. *** 22 Feb 2007: Simple game with three newbies took a bit more than three hours, including explanation, but ended rather abruptly. As indicated in the rules, the simple game should only be played to learn the basic game mechanisms. *** 24 Feb 2007: Full game with three players, of which two newbies, lasted almost nine hours. Should go faster with more experience, but nevertheless downtime between turns might be an issue. Winning thanks to fast food chains was rather pleasant! *** 25 Feb 2007: Advanced game with three players (again two newbies) - 5 hours. Just as with the simple game, the game ended too fast. There were still a whole lot of things to do and the Age III cards looked tempting. *** 14 March 2007: Full game with two players - 5 hours. *** 12 January 2008: Full game with three players - 5 hours. *** 20 September 2008: Simple game with three players. *** 25 April 2009: Full game with three players - 7 or 8 hours. *** Conclusion: the full game has definitely my preference! *** 2013: started online playing ...

RATING: 9
The game is much like computer Civilization. There is no map to move your units, but game concepts like research, production, population grown, happiness, corruption or even revolution are similar. It you are the Civilization fan, you will see the connection clearly.

It is very demanding game. Game flow is like an avalanche. In the first rounds you slowly build your empire. Minor mistakes made at the beginning reveals catastrophically later. But the game gives you a chance to adjust your development to cards which come to play. So at the end, if you lose, you usually have a feeling that if you had done better, you would have won.

The idea of civic cards coming visible with higher cost at the beginning and lower at the end is great. It makes randomizes much less in the area of gathering civic cards. The game has many other little but great and original features like corruption, workers or technologies.

TtA has also several drawbacks. The biggest of them is a randomization with military cards. It is impossible to get particular military card type for sure, you must be lucky. So if you have a strong military you may be unable to attack anyone  because you didn't draw a suitable card. Also the distribution of end-game scoring events (which are about 30 to 50% of total scoring) is totally random. Another drawback is that the game is very hard to beginners. There are two simplified game versions but both of them are broken from the advanced player perspective. Sometimes I have a feeling that it can turn too complex at all...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Elaborate system, however:

- Almost no interaction (like wars, trade, etc.), plays more like several parallel solitaire games

- Designed to harass the player who is already behind so that there is almost no chance to get back into play if you are losing

Very well done CIV game. Although we love playing on "real maps" this abstract CIV version really is one of our favourites. Best with 3 players, with 4 players the downtime (the real negative thing of this game) get's a pain in the a... and one player always has the feeling all important cards are unavailable for him.

It's a very very good game, high complexity, lot of cards so each game is different (after 15 plays I'd say that an expansion may be needed, still all games are different but sometimes it would be nice to see a new card).

Due to the downtime it's definatelly better for 2 (or 3) players. The one enormous setback is the time it requires (around 3 hours for a full 2-player game - it's just too time consuming and won't work for everyone).

Played once, with the beautiful overlays that keep the chits in place. In short the game takes forever and although not stated as a rule, it is required that you expend most of your achievements into military, especially from era 2 onward.
The game takes forever, it's constant administration, not bad in itself but not good either. Your "civ" will always consist of just a few cards like an upgraded library or a silly wonder that does almost nothing.
You beget cards from an action selection tray, seen that on many other games like concordia, suburbia. Players that have previous experience like knowing you MUST get Genghis Khan at any price, and bombers, will crush you. For seven hours. 
Have a great time!
The only (+) I can find is it is not very expensive (like 35 bucks) and does not take much shelf space. Requires quite a big table when playing btw.

Well what can I say after a four hour game that took us half through era2...

I like it. It's hard to give it an 8 or higher because of the guidelines... Let me explain :  I  I know it will take too long so I won't propose it to play with my friends Maybe one day when we have more time. 

The game really starts to pick up pace in era 2.
And for me that means the beginner game is probably broken. I still might consider beginner game

It will be hard to get it to the table; but when I does I'll be having a good time.

I like the fact that you have many options available.
Food and mines are important. I like the different governments and there impact.
Future events is something I didn't add anything on in the beginning as I was having trouble to get my civilisation going. Infact only one player added to that. Making the game progress slow. 
So I would recommend play the future events as this will make the game progress quicker.
Also the game progressed quite slowly because of the stones (you get from the mines) and the intelligence needed to build.

Would love to play this more. Great mechanics, fantastic narrative potential. It runs long but this isn't really a problem in the 2 player game because you have just enough time while they're taking their turn to plan your own.

This is one of my favourite games, 2, 3 or 4 player it is a real challenge. Its a civilization game, but with a difference. The game is governed by a row of cards with increasing costs, collect the cards you need to increase productivity and build weaponry, mines, science, wonders etc, though victory points is what you are really after. I am fortunate in that I picked my 1st edition up in Essen - no spelling errors. 
A fantastic game.

RATING: 8
Played a few more games now (~6) and find 4 player limits some of your control of what you can do since you have less turns and it takes the longest to play.  2-player is a game in itself, makes the game more challenging since you don't have to worry about a 3rd person wildcard.  Though the game does play well in 3 since the length isn't as long as 4 and your turn comes back to you quicker.  So my opinion would be best in 2 or 3, depending on the style of the game you want.  (head to head strategy or group game)

I had convinced myself that I was going to hate this game, but never having played a real civ game, felt I should give it a try. The first game carried many embarrassing and difficult mistakes, but I was intrigued.

Every play since has been increasingly more rewarding.

There is a large amount of downtime, especially with 3 or 4 players , which is why I enjoy it most with 2. Despite that fact, yes, it is still a 10.

This can be a pretty long game.  The two-player game seems to require some hefty military development, and the cards fly along the track very quickly.

I think I need more experience with all of the cards and strategies, but the game is pretty long and fiddly, so it's quite an investment.  I know some people who immediately suggested just playing a video game version of Civilization instead.  We'll see if I can get a larger group of willing players together.

Played once, 4 players, Advanced game (Ages A, I, II).  This is a very difficult game to comment after one game, because there are so many moving parts, and some of the rules are confusing.  The game has promise, though, and it seems that there will be multiple paths to victory.  The advanced game took 7 hours to play with 4.  I doubt I'd want to play the full game with 4.

RATING: 6
30 minutes of fun packed into 6 hours of play.  Developing your civilization through the ages is fun but games are way too long to really be worth it.  Additionally, you can usually tell who's going to win after a couple of hour, making the rest of the game tedious at best, and often frustrating for the losers to be.  To play this correctly, half the players have to be willing to retire from play early as their civilization gets dominated, leaving them waiting for the others to finish their (overly long) game.  I've played this with very different groups with similar outcomes.  Everyone is walking a razor edge of keeping up on the military and if anyone gets outpaced, they are done for.  Attrition is very sudden & monolithic, low forgiveness, significant reinforcing loops (winner keeps getting ahead, looser keeps falling further behind).  It could be OK but is hard to accept with such a time investment.

After 1 Simple game, 4 Advanced games, and now 1 Full game...I'm worn out, ha. All 2 player games.  Of course, the levels of strategy and options make this a blast, but now I understand how playing this with more people would take so long.

I'm looking forward to getting this on iPad (hurry up, Codito), in order to get more plays in, and I can see how the play time will be significantly cut.

This is a great game.  I have found that it gets a little same-ish over time, because it's always the same cards, leaders, etc.  But still, a really great addictive game.

Feels like a card-drive Adv. Civilization game with some resemblance to Vinci.  A very good heavy game that is deep, rich with options and offers each player loads of build-up choices at a methodical pace depending whether you play Advanced or Full versions of the game.

Most likely the best civilization building boardgame around.  While some complain about the small plastic bubbles used for resources, civic actions, military actions, and citizens, I didn't find it to be an issue.  The game definitely has a good bit of book-keeping but isn't fiddly in the sense of some games.  This really reminds me much of Civilization the computer game in boardgame form.  You do not want to get behind in the arms race nor the scientific research ability as both seem central to doing well.  Resource management seems to be at the center of the game as you seek to put together card combinations in technology, wonders, leaders, and buildings.  Yes, the game will go on for quite a while but I didn't find myself unengaged often although I doubt I would ever play with 4 players.  My biggest issue with the game is that luck of the draw can set you back at times, but with as many cards as this game holds, hopefully this is mitigated over time.

Very well designed and interesting civilization game.  This sits at my upper limit for epic games in terms of length and it is not a game I would like to play often because of its length.  That said, I respect the design and enjoy playing it when I can get the chance.  My favorite part is managing resource production, population etc.  I especially like how technological innovation allows you to use resources more efficiently.

Man it's a struggle to get this one to the table but I really love it. I grew up on Civilization on the PC and this scratches that itch in an amazing way. Hope I can get a full game in face to face sometime this year!

Even though I can mainly play online, this game is definitely a 10.

Edit 1/27/2015

I have to knock this down a little because the new version is definitely an improvement, although I didn't think it needed one! Again I mostly play on BGO, but I get the feeling the improvements in the new version will make it easier to get to the table... once I finally get mine!

A Euro-engine game on Civilization... a Czech production.  It is sad to see the new edition had all the famous names removed due to copyright issue, e.g Elvis and Sid Meier.  Nonetheless, it still gives you a great historical feel with the other great names like Julius Caesar, Leonardo da Vinci.  I played the basic game only once but it gave me a good impression.  It is sometime hard to know what are you doing on the path to victory and what are the others doing, unless you have a clear and determined mind.  With the resources growing with the buildings, your kingdom expands with your subjects within the allowable actions number constrained by the form of government.  The basic game sees no advantage to advance your military might as you cannot threaten others with it to get something in exchange of peace.  On the other hand, it is best to advance science (lab) and culture (drama) to keep your people happy.

This would be a very good game, except for one thing: the military strategy is too strong. This often works to reduce the game to a "who-picks-Napoleon-up" race. I much prefer a civilization game that allows for the civilized ones to win sometimes, instead of always falling to the barbarians.

RATING: 8
Requires a lot of thought from the beginning on.  Beginners should have enough to think about with the Simplified version, at least for their first game (even seasoned players): 13 cards to look at and combine with one's tableau, plus the opponent's cards‚Ä¶

The flow of time is palpable; this creates a sense of urgency.  "This leader looks good, should I take it before it disappears, which might come fast?".  Zipping through time is also a nice experience, which can be contrasted to that of some other engine-building games (Race for the Galaxy, Caylus Magna Carta, Agricola).  Plus, the perspective of moving forward in time gives some motivation for playing longer--as does feeling that your civilization is not as complete as you wanted it to be!

Some mechanisms similar to some other games: some cards that you buy (Wonders, Leaders) give you various advantages (as in Race for the Galaxy), some cards that you own produce (as in Race for the Galaxy, and Caylus Magna Carta), you need to consume resources regularly (food, in Through the Ages, as in Agricola).

The handling of tokens is a little fiddly (heavier than in Agricola), but the good rule book makes the procedure quite clear. It quickly becomes second nature, though. Plus, token movements are limited: that each player has its own set of tokens and that they stay in his playing area.

It is useful to understand that the "Science" level represents a _potential_ for technological discoveries, and as such, that it can be "used up" (one cannot do research and use it to discover an infinite number of things).

Graphics are rigid and really not world class; by far not as polished as those from Race for the Galaxy, Blue Moon, Caylus Magna Carta,...  The board quality and card quality is OK; the board is very shiny and mine is slightly warped.  One of the decks is hard to extract from the inner plastic box because of its shape.

I liked the events in the Simple game: they are bonuses, it's Christmas time!

After 1‚Äì2 plays, I'm not sure it's a game "I always want to play" yet. It has this potential, but its sheer length, coupled with the fact that it is quite close to a Euro (at least the Simple game: resource management, full information) prevent me from loving it in the same way as I love Race (short and meaty), Claustrophobia (original, with exploration, special powers, theme,‚Ä¶), Magic (surprises, mechanics tied beautifully to the theme‚Ä¶), Agricola (not too long, with cards that make each game a little different). Through the Ages does not (yet?) seem to have this little spark that makes me love games and want to always play them.

The rules are quite precise and clear. However, they require too much memorization: many details are in the text and can be easily forgotten (we have a very limited working memory), which makes reading the rule not so easy. So, in practice, some sections might require a lot of back and forth checks, and some details might be missed easily. It would be useful if many details were first summarized and given in a simple to refer to overview (like: where are the new elements of the Advanced game compared to the Simple game).

I do not like all the accounting required in the game.
Also, I did not enjoy the 4 player game...way too much down time (do to all the accounting).
The 3 player game is a little faster, but still too much waiting around.
However, the 2 player game is fun building your civilization, but you do lose a lot of strategy.

Excelente juego de excelente tem√°tica: la historia de la civilizaci√≥n humana desde sus comienzos hasta la actualidad.
Un trabajo resuelto eficazmente en un juego de mec√°nica sencilla que permite ponerte en los huesos de algunos de los personajes m√°s influyentes de la historia (l√≠deres) mientras desarrollas tu civilizaci√≥n de diversas maneras (militarmente, cient√≠ficamente, tecnol√≥gicamente) incluyendo la construcci√≥n de maravillas, para conseguir ser la mejor cultura del mundo.
Un juego que recuerda a Agr√≠cola en la sensaci√≥n que transmite de que parece faltarte tiempo y acciones civilies y militares para llevar a cabo todo lo que tienes en mente; pero mientras en Agr√≠cola esa sensaci√≥n es acuciante, en Through the ages tienes la esperanza de que lo que te ha faltado en una mejor gesti√≥n de tus recursos.

JUEGO BASICO

Escasa interacci√≥n en la variante m√°s corta y simple del juego, y menos a√∫n para 2 jugadores ya que la mayor√≠a de cartas de tecnolog√≠a necesarias para mejorar la civilizaci√≥n est√°n por duplicado y ning√∫n jugador, seg√∫n las reglas del juego, puede tener 2 cartas iguales de tecnolog√≠a en posesi√≥n; de este modo, es inviable intentar perjudicar a los jugadores rivales por este camino. En partidas de 3 o 4 jugadores el juego adquiere mayor tensi√≥n, ya que el jugador que adquiera tal o cu√°l carta de tecnolog√≠a est√° evitando que otros jugadores la tengan, oblig√°ndoles a cerrar una v√≠a de desarrollo de su civilizaci√≥n y haci√©ndoles pensar en otras alternativas. 

Notas a priori tras la 1¬™ partida del juego a 2 jugadores

Nota 1: Fundamental mirar y remirar la lista de 13 cartas civiles en cada momento, optimizando en lo posible el gasto de acciones civiles y militares.

Nota 2: Tener un ojo en los indicadores de fuerza, cultura y ciencia de los rivales debe ser una constante.

Nota 3: A priori,al principio de la partida parece m√°s importante desarrollar una 3¬™ (e incluso 4¬™) mina antes que una 3¬™ granja, ya que sin recursos los trabajadores inactivos no sirven para nada. La creaci√≥n de granjas adicionales debe venir despu√©s.

Nota 4: La carta de acci√≥n "Work of Art" resulta muy √∫til, ya que permite aumentar la cuenta de Puntos de cultura en 5 √≥ 6 unidades de una tacada.

Nota 5: A la hora de construir una maravilla es preferible hacerlo en aquellas cuyos beneficios puedan ser un complemento a las habilidades del l√≠der elegido, ya que las maravillas no son f√°ciles ni r√°pidas de construir.

Nota 6: El indicador de puntos de ciencia es vital para construir tanto las mejoras de las cartas de tecnolog√≠a agr√≠cola y mineras como la de las cartas de tecnolog√≠a especiales y de gobierno; por lo tanto, tener algunos laboratorios debe ser algo fundamental tambi√©n, si no al principio de la partida, una vez entrada la 4 o 5¬™ rondas, una vez las minas "extras" ya se han construido.

Nota 7: Las caras felices tambi√©n son importantes, luego los templos tambi√©n son importantes, pero quiz√° con 1/2 ya sea suficiente, ya que algunas de las maravillas permiten adem√°s aumentar la felicidad de la poblaci√≥n de la civilizaci√≥n. 

Nota 8: La elecci√≥n del l√≠der debe ser bastante reflexionada ya que s√≥lo puede tenerse 1 l√≠der de cada era. En funci√≥n de sus habilidades especiales debes basar el desarrollo de tu civilizaci√≥n; de esta manera llegar√°s m√°s lejos en menos tiempo.
En funci√≥n del l√≠der elegido, dar√°s preferencia a un aspecto √∫ otro de tu civilizaci√≥n, aunque no hay que olvidar que la mejor civilizaci√≥n es la mejor equilibrada.

Very long, somewhat complex, extremely tight and a total blast to play. Rules seem intimidating at first but play a few rounds of the Advanced game and it all just makes sense. Wish they had paid a bit more attention to detail in production, score track is wrong and there's mistakes all over the place. Kinda sad considering the price tag they put on it.

Comments entered on 23 Dec 2009:

Any game that bills itself as a civilization building game is going to get my attention. Like many others, I was concerned that this game would be weak because it lacked a map. That has turned out to be a completely unfounded worry. Through the Ages places an emphasis on building up an economic engine, developing technologies, and scoring points while not completing ignoring the aspect that conflict impacts the growth of an empire.

The first couple plays of this game was using the Basic and Advanced game versions. These are excellent to get a feel for the mechanics of the game, but to really see the luster and shine of this game, it needs to be played as a Full game with all three ages playing out. After several plays, certain strategies begin to present themselves for achieving victory, but because the card row plays out differently every game, a player must remain flexible to the changing circumstances.

Quite simply the best Civ game out there. Everything a civ game need is in the box: tech, worker/resource management, happiness of your population, military, leaders, wonders... It is the most "complete" game I own. 

I really like the Row of cards which ensure that no one will get all the same tech/upgrades. Sure you can get hose by this (especially if you cannot get a Farm/Mine upgrade Tech) but it ensures each game are different.

The Military aspect is cool too. If every one is at the same level nothing happens: like in real world! You have to maintain a military presence just so you won't get picked on.

The only fault of this game: it is easy to get behind the curve in every aspect of the game (Culture and ressources). When this happens there is almost no possibility of recovery. And for a game that long, being out of the game when there is still 1-2 hours to play is not that great :). 

Our Full game for 2 players clocks at 2h30. And it is probably the best 2h30 of gaming you can have.

Finally played the FULL game, which is the way everyone should experience this game the first time. We called it with 1/3 of the 3rd deck left, as it was clear who would win.

I've played Civ and Advanced Civ before, and this definitely fits the bill as a card version of those, but I feel that unless you play it enough to know the game, the play time doesn't actually come in at any less than those games. It's supposed to be shorter, and with experience I'm certain it is. 

The question is, will I want to play this again, or even frequently?

Update:

Another play, and soon to see even more. It's been a long time coming getting it to the table, but since we've now got a following for it in our club I have no doubt that the plays for this one will rise.

This game is amazing. I never thought I'd see a civilization game so perfectly rendered. The lack of map probably helps the game more than it hurts it, as the lack of geography helps control when conflict first emerges. The three levels of gameplay make it easy to teach the right players the correct level of difficulty, and the full game is a treasure trove of strategy, theme, and excitement.

My major complaint about the game is the horrible wooden discs you use to keep track of everything. They are too small and fiddly. 8 mm colored cubes would be vastly preferred, and I don't regret buying some to fix the components here.

A problem I have with playing the PC game Civilization online with other people is that games tend to last longer than a day or even two unless you restrict yourself to tiny maps that force combat from the get go, and then it becomes a race to eliminate players rather than allowing for all the various win conditions the game normally offers.

This game solves all of that. It is like playing PC Civilization vs. other people, except you can actually finish a game of it in under 4-8 hours! Still really long for a board game, but when that is what you want, there are few games finer than this.

This game won me over late. My initial impression was of the bland art, sadistic rolling tokens, and a set of rules that made me think "why not just shove the whole thing onto a PC?" But the wonderful way in which one's civilization slowly evolves into its own quirky little creation makes this game endlessly fun and addictive, and there are always new cards to throw an extra twist into gameplay.. I do think it very slightly loses out to the old Avalon Hill classic History of the World, though, where you get a little more narrative structure with a bit less grinding.

I never get to play this game - unfortunately it is too difficult to just slam on the table. You have to go through 2 learning games (first playing only a third and then playing 2 thirds of the game), which basically never happens.
I guess none of this would be a problem if I had the same group of people every gaming night and a smaller collection of games.
Still an amazing game, but harder to get to the table than TI3 imho...

After repeated plays I have lowered my score on this one.  I enjoy the game but the aggression and wars make the game a real drag.  The game is too military centered.  Once you fall behind in military the game is over.  Sort of a arms race not a civ game.  Late in the game the only way to play is to advance yourself by beating down the weakest civ.  There is NO catch up in the game.  Once you fall behind you are done for.  If you fail to be able to grab an important card on your turn then your done for if you lose yellow tokens you are done for if you lose blue tokens you are done for and all of these can happen through no action you take.  Purely randomly.  So after repeated plays I have lowered my score based on the mean spirited feel this game has.

RATING: 9
A very fun Civilization game that gives you a feel of the computer game without the map.  You use actions to build buildings, get leaders, build wonders, build military, etc.  

You use political actions to affect events in the future.  

Military is all important in this game and you cannot ignore it.  If you do, you lose.  

The games always play out differently depending on when certain cards come out.  But the game has a massive learning curve, it is "fiddly" and you are looking at about 1.5 hours per player if they are AP prone or it is your first few times playing.  Experience players could get it down to 1 hour per player, but that is after many plays.  

I like the game, it is great, but AP players need to stay away.

Everything that is said about downtime and play length problems with four players is true.  This is a game I would like to like on theme alone, so I might try this again with 2 or 3 players, but it doesn't really stand out enough from other euro-bland resource management games to justify its play time.

Longish so won't be played often (the main drawback for me). Interesting and I look forward to seeing how cards interact. Bigger player mats with cubes would have been more functional. The glass counters are very pretty but hard even for me to pick up.

One of the best games I know.
CIV game without a map - brilliant!

RATING: 5.9
Good civilization style fun without a map. I think the game really benefits from not being map based. You can definitely tell the roots of this game come from the PC game Civilization. There is a delicate economy to balance and it can really mess up your efficiency if you let it get messed up. Although you can still come out ahead at the end depending on which bonuses pop up. The only real confusing thing is how the military operations work. All in all a fun civilization building experience. Be ready to dedicate several hours to this one though.

RATING: 7
Long, fiddly, complex game, in which you always see the same cards every game, so you can truly play a very strategic game.  Best with 2 players, but just too much for us, particularly as we don't tend to play games sufficiently to master them.

Unlikely to play again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

RATING: 8
Great game, but with only one play, it's hard to give it a better rating. I've been told that there are a number of card combos that are incredibly powerful. I witnessed one of these. When I asked the more familiar player what could be done to combat this once it was in place, he said not much. That idea, that there wasn't much we could do to stop him, took a bit of the wind out of my sails.

Regardless, it's still a game I would play again without hesitation. I'm sure, given similar skill levels, it's not how do I stop his combo, but what combo am I going to accomplish that's just as good.

RATING: 10
This is a "heavy", interesting game with great interaction (via politics/aggression actins) and a good mix of strategy and tactical decisions, but overall a deeply strategic game.  

Once past the "simple" game, you find novel mechanics, interesting decisions, and great fun.  It really feels like you are building something...and with the political interaction, it is not solitaire (also interaction in the cards you pull from the board).  

It has been a while since I was this excited about a game.  It could very well end up being a 10, but I would need more plays to see if it stands the test of time.  However, I see TTA as a game I'd always want to play.  

Downsides: Play time - the game takes a while...if you want a faster game, you can play the "advanced" game and only two ages versus the full.  But, if you pull out TTA, it is likely the only game you will play that night.

By the 2nd game, when one player was done with actins and card draw, the next player set up and would begin his turn while the other did his housekeeping.  This kept the game moving along at a much faster pace (and reduced downtime).

9/2012 A very good game of resource management and player area development. On the down side it's very looong and there is a real run-away-leader problem.  There's even events promoting this problem: "The strongest player received 5 points and the weakest looses 5 points".  Whoever wrote these cards doesn't know what makes a good social atmosphere.

Excellent game that really captures the feel of Civilization, yet has no map, and (only) takes about 3 hours to play. It might not hit the table often at that length and weight, but it's a very rich and strategic game.

Wow, what an in-depth and well designed game. The technology progression is perfectly in line with resource production progression, and the bookkeeping is very simple. 

My complaints for this game are first, the length of this game with 3-4 people can become atrocious unless everyone knows the game very well. Secondly, combat between players seems very arbitrary due to the defenders advantage, and in my experience leads to very passive, but still very fun, games.

Definitely not enough time to do everything you want in this game. Not even close. I'll need to play this many more times before I even begin to feel like I've explored the game. Unfortunately a slightly longer play length than most Euro games has kept this from being played as often as it should, because it IS a fantastic game, but that's not a complaint; if it went any quicker it just wouldn't be satisfying.

After first "advanced" game i am very impressed. I want to play full version as soon as possible. Generaly i prefer shorter games but during TTA i didn't feel time pass and i didn't feel any discomfort or fatigue. I was excited during all game. But of course time is a reason why this game would not hit the table as often as it should. Maybe with time we would learn to play it quicker. Our firsy game took 3h.
Great game, rating may raise or drop with more plays.
After more plays i think it is not exactly my piece of cake. There are a lot of little mechanics making big engine but for me, it is much too much for what it is, especially if you consider randomness in card taking. Too long and too convoluted for what it is. But a lot of my friends love it.

An excellent thinkfest. It is really a "big box" game in a very small box. Even though the game is card driven, it is still extremely challenging.

It's one of the highest rated games on BGG, I know a lot of people who really like it... and I just don't really get it. I'm a huge fan of the Civ computer series, so it isn't that the game's focus is one I can't get into. The game is just drastically not worth the investment of time for me.

Ok, do NOT play the simple game of this with the hopes of getting any sort of fulfilling experience.  It serves to teach the concepts of the full game only.  You can make some good solid choices and do poorly in the simple game.  It offers you cards that ONLY benefit long term play.  The simple game is NOT like the family version of Agricola, where you get a full game with some elements removed, and also teaches you the basics of the full.  In fact if you ever play the simple game of this, do NOT score it at the end.  Just chalk it up for learning concepts for the full game.  Just a warning.

RATING: 3
On the one hand, this seems like an interesting (mapless) civ game, but there are some issues that, when pared with the length, make it undesirable.  Primarily I have issues with the fact that the event cards mostly beat up on the weakest player, and reward the stronger/strongest player. 

It also seems like the kind of game that someone who really loves the Civ computer games would create, but it seems a bit fiddly (and long).

Playing 2 player online is a good experience.

--- 
Reevaluated after a few more plays with 3 players, this game has slipped a bit for me.  It's long and very tactical, but what kills me is the way the randomness, particularly of the military cards, can impact the game.

2015-08 Traded in big trade, will play online or with friends

One of my very favorite games, but after playing online I don't want to go back. The counters are so fiddly and you spend too much time on the bookkeeping/counter tracking, when you could be strategizing. It's also so long that it's hard to bring to the table.

But online, all those issues disappear, especially if you're playing asynchronously. I love how the engine comes together, the sweep of time, and the variations introduced by the 2.0 and 3.0 versions (at least as implemented on BGO). 

I prefer playing with 4, but it works with 2 and 3, it's just a VERY different experience in both.

Played 3 times Table 1.0, countless BGO 2.0 and 3.0, BGA 1.0

This game has somewhat nice atmosphere of civilization building. Governments, farms and mines, leaders, cultural buildings, armies, wars, colonizations, events... it includes almost all the factors which we can expect from a civ-game. But I don't think it is well constructed. It could be a very good game, but it is not.

1) It is almost solitary. Interactions are only aggresions and wars. But raising agression or declaring war is not so often a good choice. So there are just not enough interactions.

2) War and agression encourages players to gang upon the weakest. The weakest loses something(armies, points, populations, resources, etc.) and weakens again, resulting that it is hard for her or him to regain competant position after a couple of loss. It feels bitter.

1)   2) = The only form of direct interaction of this game is not so pleasant.

3) Much downtime. There is almost nothing to do during other players' turn. At least PoF last only 1 hour or so, but this game lasts 5-7 hours. If you play with 4, downtime almost kills. I may play 3-player game again, but never play 4-player game.

4) Some leaders too strong, some leaders too weak. They are not well-balanced.

5) Due to difficulties of upgrading technologies, anachronistic situations often occur, e.g. medieval cavalries with air forces.

6) Card-drafting mechanic. It is just arbitrary and abstract. Is there anything relevant to the historical development of civilizations in St.Petersburg-style card drafting? Why do technologies come out randomly, and why do their prices keep reduced? Moreover, its randomness with unblanced cards can hugely favor some lucky player.

While I think I get all the things that TtA does very well (making you feel in charge of a civilization during a long time, finding the sweet spot between too many choices and too few each turn), I have to admit that this is not the game for me. Really too long for the pleasure it brings me, fiddly, with a production lacking on some minor but annoying ways (the same symbols meaning different things depending on context, for starting), a bit too punishing of early mistakes...
As much as I am a huge fan of Vlaada Chvatil mid-sized gems (Galaxy Trucker and Space Alert, to cite the best ones), I'm not the intended audience for this one.

This game is unique IMO as every player has to take into account plenty of aspects: military, industry, science, food, happiness, colonies and - last but not least - victory points. What is fine - as the ages progress you have opportunities to set back and improve the aspects you was lousy before (except colonies maybe). So - if you have absolutely no access to science before, you should go for substitutes like wonders or libraries or free science cards, eventually a card pops out that your science-satisfied rivals will not intend to get dearly, but that will be very valuable to you, so you have a nice chance to get it (except if someone plays destructively against you). Multiple ages almost guarantee that - if you want - you will eventually have opportunities to improve specific area, unlike many other games where you may never get a chance. Luck or lack of luck is what makes (at least this game) interesting and unique - you have no guarantee that you will get what you hope for. Then, at some point, you have to adapt your strategy, what is very interesting. 

There is a lot of balancing hidden, but not artificial, like say in [thing=2651]Power Grid[/thing]. There is also some brutal reality: weakest military civilization would be pondered by neighbors and events that take from weak and give to strong, scientific civ could quickly progress technology unraveling other areas, neglecting production or science may be difficult to catch up, etc. 

   Excellent game, being very close to reality, progressing your civ over many aspects is lots of fun, virtually no trade or negotiations make sure players sympathies and social skills are not included in the picture (not completely though - choice of aggression/war victims). Randomness is required and welcome here IMHO, but it will never win the game instead of you.

It can be fiddly, and it's kind of race. But with full four players there is more place for interaction. Not a brain burner, just long game. Enjoyable as experience, not so much as competition.

RATING: 8
2/10 - after a few more plays, including 4p for the first time.  Still a 9.  The 3p is clearly the best, but 4p was fun too - biggest drawback is down time.  As for complexity, my hardcore 9-year old won in his second game, without any helps whatsoever.  Stick with it, the game is worth it.  I prefer one set of rules with an index, don't give me different games, bleah.

11/09 - after 15 plays - fantastic.  A classic.  Not a perfect game due to the mechanical aspects of the game - tiny cards, moving tiny bits all over the place, etc.

1/09 - after 4 or 5 plays it still feels new.  Each play is very different.  If you are a gamer, go straight to the full game.  This is maybe a little harder than something like Agricola, but still works pretty easily in the game itself.  As an avid SM's Civ series nut, this is the closest feeling board or card game in relation to the PC game series.  Truly epic, definitely works well.  Rating subject to change.

12/08 - Arrived at Christmas!!!!!  Awaiting replacement deck as mine was messed up - sad now.  Awesome customer service - decks complete - quick!

Have waited quite a while and now there is a reprint supposed to be available in Jan/Feb 08 (FunAgain).  It is $70 which is a bit steep, but if the quality of the components is decent (see threads - pictures of TtA) as DdJ describes then it is all good.  I am very, very much looking forward to this game.  For me, price comes down to how many hours I get out of something - my PC games (like Civ IV) shine in this area.  TtA sounds like the closest thing to Civ IV in cardboard and wood.

Still haven't pre-ordered (12/07).  I already have Agricola on pre-order.  I may have to wait and just buy this when it comes out early next year.  I can wait another six or eight weeks.

And now it is 2/08 and it is out.  And there are issues - not great quality parts, 80s but no 90s, the minor cube thingy.  I think this will continue to be a wait until there is an edition I feel fully satisfied with - or simply never.  It is amazing that on BGG people complain about how expensive Starcraft is vs. a game like TtA.  The value of the game is first and foremost the game, then the components.  I _know_ Starcraft is a great game.  I presume TtA is also.

5 / 5 - Outstanding.

This is hard and heavy but grimly addictive. The intense nature of working out your turn means there's not as much table-talk as I'd like but there is some bluffing and there's just about enough interaction to keep this interesting. The theme is also engaging although it falls apart on close inspection, such as my uber-army of Napoleonic troops supported by jet fighters, but the sense of building up toward a greater goal is palpable. It's rare to find a game which manages to combine just enough theme and interaction with seriously heavy gameplay *and* potentially bottomless creative strategy - that's what sets this game apart from the crowd.

Might just be fatigue but I moved this down to an 8. I still really like this game but after playing a lot online I've realized that there is huge disadvantage to military card draw. If you don't get any decent tactics, unless you get a very lucky set of circumstances in the card row you're probably going to lose to an aggressive player.

Though after many plays I do see a lot of nuances that a newer or intermediate player may not see like card denial and manipulating the card row for future turns.

RATING: 6
Too harsh on the newbie, too easy to fall behind and (once picked on by someone with a military) too hard to get back into the game.  This latter bit is OK with an hour-long game, but unacceptable with anything much longer (like this game).  Despite this, I'm impressed with the complexity and fun (so long as no one gets an overwhelming military advantage) of this game.

Rating could go either way. Pros are that the game is fairly deep and there appear to be a lot of different viable strategies. Cons are that the game is very long, the turns feel repetitive, there is relatively low interaction, and because there is little interaction downtime is an issue. I would never play this with 4.

I enjoy playing with the peaceful variant, and then adding the military strength to the point total at the end.

What I like:
- Lots of engine building and upgrading.
- Need to be fairly balanced in all areas to be most efficient.  You can feel the impact of areas that are weak or too strong.
- There's some direct conflict but it's not the main part of the game.
- Every action you take is important and usually you don't have wasted actions.
- Future events provide some long-term planning, but there is also tension in not knowing what future events your opponents have played.
- Rules were fairly intuitive and there were not a lot of little exceptions.

What I don't like:
- Long game length, especially with more players.
- Can have lots of downtime with more players.
- Lots of little pieces for bookkeeping.  Sometimes it's easy to forget if you've updated your counters.  We wrote a simple web interface to do most of the bookkeeping for us.
- Very unforgiving if you fail to establish a good engine by Age II
- Age III doesn't seem as interesting as the previous ages, because it's mostly about scoring lots of points. Perhaps the advanced game is a better enjoyment/time ratio for us.

The change is due to the fact that we find the length of the game and the disasterous effect that wars have on weaker players detracts badly from the enjoyment of all the other aspects of the game.

Changed back to 9 since introducing a house rule that napoleon cannot be picked up. Wars are less devastating, if they happen at all.

Most of my plays are online games. I may have played half a dozen times in person. While I'm happy to play 2, 3, or 4 player online, I'll only play 3P in person because 4P takes too long and 2P is just a different game. It's a very clever and elegant game that requires some really clever optimisation and requires you to keep your eye on a number of factors - especially what your opponents are doing. Ultimately, this will probably drop from my list because I don't seem to be getting any better at it and I don't enjoy it enough to put in the investment

Terribly laid out rulebook, but the full three age game is where it's at.

Through the Ages is a game which at first blush seems to have three or four main strategies, many of which are extremely luck dependent. As you delve into the experience, however, you begin to see the nuanced bits of tactics and strategy within the underlying architecture. I'm over 100 plays in and I'm still learning about ways to use particular cards in the game which I thought were useless cards when I first approached the design. A wonderful game to delve into for a good long time.

This game is awesome.  It is both very strategic and low variance -- because you know *which* cards will come out, though you may not know when -- and tactical because you have to adjust to your opponent(s) play.  The only randomness really comes from drawing military cards but in exchange they provide bluffing opportunities.  There are a few downsides:  the military cards *can* screw you occasionally, the rulebook is awful, the setup is lengthy, and with a 1 hour per player game time good luck getting this to your gaming table.

12/03/09 Obtained. I have the third/final printing, that corected some mistakes of the previous two. 
05/28/11 Played a three-player Simple Game. Overall I think Through the Ages looks good and plays smoothly. Though I do have a few small quibbles with a couple of the icons. I have sort of mixed feelings concerning the rule book. Oh, everything is in there. Its written to initially feed you only what you need to know for your first game. That's great for getting you into the game. But then when you want to move on to the Advanced or Full game its makes it hard go back and find some of the basic rules, as they are buried in between a huge amount of examples. My rating is provisional until I play the Advanced and Full games. 
07/23/11 Played the Simple game again.
10/18/14 Ditto.

The best civilization game. It's a high strategical build-up game with a lot of opportunities and decisions (and it's more interactive than Agricola). It can be played in 2 hours and is very good with 2 as well as 4 players.

RATING: 8
My '8' is a strong eight. The rating is based on one full advanced 4-player game which took 6.5h.

A good and borderline excellent game. I could see that 3-player game is the best. 4-player game dragged a bit and there was some downtime (noone of us had played before).

I expected a bit more fluid gameplay but I have to admit it managed to include all the important Civ game features.

Update 1.12.2008: - after 3-player game. Rating raised to '9'. Three player game is definite sweetspot and this time we played a couple of things correctly which improved some questionable aspects we encountered at our first game. Magnificent Civ-game. But I am hesitated to play this with any other player # than 3.

Update 2012: Rating dropped to '8'. Great game but now it has gotten relatively repetitive...

RATING: 7
Interesting game based on one advanced game straight away (3.5 hours). On the negative side: fiddly bead management, slow, learning curve, very solitary playing and I was missing the element of trade which has been so crucial to development of civilizations through the ages. On the positive side: you are really building something up, lots of choices, an innovative mechanism, lots of cards, so lots of variation, well balanced, keeps you focused all the time. I will get more plays in and will judge again. Rating may go up or down.
Update: slightly downgraded after another play. It is a very good game, but I am just missing the fun factor. I am more critical about these longer games: it really has to be worth the time spent. Playing time is valuable and I might play it again, but there are many better ways to spend your gaming night. The solitary play, the lack of interaction and just not enough fun factor are my main problems. But it remains somewhat of a love-hate relationship with this game, as it is indeed special too. Any way, play it, it is worth judging yourself.

Another hit dead-center for me.  Wow, what a fun game to play.  You really get a sense of building a civilization.  One thing is for sure, attacking a neighboring civilization is not an easy task.  I really liked the overwhelming quantity of cards and their different interaction.  I can see this game growing on me :-)

Edit after 5 games : This is really a deep game.  After 5 games, I can really appreciate the quality of the gameplay.  Evidently, with all games this long, you NEED good partners, which I am very lucky to have.

Edit after 8 games : This goes up from 9 to 10.  This game grows on me.  The more I play it, the more I discover things interlocking together.  For a game this long, It's so good you can't be wrong.

Edit after 20 games : The more it goes, the more I see different strategies.  I am certain that this game will be a hit for me for many years to come...

RATING: 9
This is a very interesting, very involving civ game. The mechanisms for balancing production against corruption and workers against happiness are simple, but cleverly executed, though the size of the tokens and their sheer number makes this slightly fiddly. The whole game is a little fiddly, given the number of cards and other components, but this is a minor problem for the experience. A larger problem is the play time, which is long when you look at the clock, but doesn't feel it when you play. I think I'd want to keep this to three players max just because of the sheer length of time it takes. The problem is more one of finding the time to play rather than thinking it runs long.

This game had an enormous amount of down time, and everyone I played it with also found it quite boring. I quite literally spent a large amount of time preparing food in the kitchen while waiting for my turn, which was actually quite limiting in early rounds and uninteresting.  Furthermore, the combat system is one of the ugliest and completely uninteresting I have ever seen.  This game does not deserve to be anywhere near the top 10 and its an insult to the other games in the top 50, almost all of which really truly deserve to be there.  Not to mention the components, which were shoddy, the scoring track was missing numbers 90-99, talk about terrible quality.

I love that game... It's the game with the closest feeling to the computer version I found yet. Although some people don't like the fact that there's not a lot of player interaction. I don't mind. Most of the effect another player will have on your game is the choices he makes, not what he can actually do to you... This is not a war game, it's a development game for a special niche of player.

My main let down is that most of the Third Age cards won't really affect gameplay unless they come out at the beginning of the age... You just don't have enough time to get them into play...

In the past, I haven't been a huge fan of civilization-based games, but this one has a beautiful simplicity and elegance to it that makes it very enjoyable to play.  There's always so much to do and so few resources with which to do it.  There's so many different ways of getting points and your strategy is ever-changing based on the cards available and the strengths and weaknesses of your opponents.  I dislike direct attacking in any game I play, so I'm not wild about the war aspect of this game, but that's merely a personal preference and not a slight against the design in any way.  This is a long one, but definitely fun to play.

RATING: 4
Very epic in scope despite being a card-game. The whole "micromanage your empire" is a well-functioning and fun system of moving bits here and there to adapt to the circumstances. A bit tactical if you don't know the deck, but you will be seeing all the civil cards (which are the main drivers of your "resources", while the military-side is how you interact with your opponents) so if you know them all you know what to plan for - which will inform your overarching strategy much more than initial plays where you just smash together whatever happens to be available.

I liked it, and I can really see myself loving a computer adaptation (like on BGA) but I won't be loving the face-to-face game unless it speeds up a bit. At three hours with 3 or 4 players, and an hour and a half with 2 then I would like it - but I can't really see it happening without going through several plays that go well beyond that. A lot of it is simply the fiddly parts, moving small (way to small!) bits around and hoping you remembered to do each step correctly. The decisions are fine and take the time they take - though I'm not sure I like how it all scales up and up and up - perhaps I'd like it better if your civil actions especially kept to a rather flat 4-5 instead of scaling up to 9 or beyond. Anyway...

I like it (like I said) and I'll be happy to play it more but it won't reach the lofty heights for me.

This is a great game, but it has some problems.  It's too long for what it is.  The artwork is largely missing, and what is there is not very good.  The theme doesn't come through terribly well.

But it's a great Euro card game.  It just suffers from it's own weight.  I'd love to play it again, but it's such a large time commitment that I don't see it being played often.

However, there appears to be a lot of flexibility in the design, and the mechanisms blend together very well.  It does give you a feeling of building something, which is great, but I don't necessarily feel like I'm building a civilization.

I really like it, but I feel I should like it more.  With that said, I'm looking forward to the next game.  And with that said, I'm hoping I can find another Civilization game that fits my needs better... Clash of Cultures? Fingers crossed!

Edit: I also picked up Nations as a direct replacement for this.

2nd play: I gave it a second chance. After play I was bored and tired. I really want to find this thing which makes this game so popular and highly rated. But I'm afraid it's beyond my power. Follow the recommendations I should gave it 3.
3rd play: Damn, I like it ;)

I'm still on the fence about this one.  I like the concept, but it still feels like bean-counting and too subject to randomness to be enjoyable to anyone who hasn't memorized the cards and grokked the combos.

Essen '06  Wow.  What a great game.  I think this may be the Civ-lite everybody searches for.  Played a full game in about 4.5 hours, and could probably finish a little before 4 hours.  Also includes options for shorter or friendlier games.  Components excellent considering the small company producing it.  Brilliant graphic design, and a slurry of mechnisms that all mesh beautifully.  Good pacing, and never enough resources to do what you want to do.  Triple thumbs up: could move to a 9.5 as I check repeat play.  Possible top 10 game for me?

This is a great game once the learning curve has been overcome. Once all players are on even footing the game tells a wonderful story with each play. Civilizations grow, decline, get attacked, recover, and in the end, build some wonders and head off into the space age. It's a long game, but not so unforgiving that an early mistake dooms you to last place each time. And after 20+ plays now, I am still amazed at how well balanced everything is. You just don't have enough resources to build too much of any one unit or building; you must plan, diversify, and stay within your means. The game's length will keep many gamers away. But for gamers who can find time to both learn and appreciate this one, the game is a masterpiece.

This game is a micro management GIANT.

It has a same effect as in Le Havre: you're all the time kind of short of some resource and you need to carefully balance your actions or you're doomed.

The small wooden components shift/switch maybe too easily places and it's too easy to forget to do the mandatory tasks. In overal, it's a bit too much of a solitaire? 4 players = 4 hours minimum?

This game was intimidating the first time we played, and to be completely honest, every time since.  So far we have both managed not to run away from the gaming table screaming in distress though.  Fortunately, there are three versions of the game, basic, advanced and full.  We played the basic version 3-4 times before graduating to the advanced version.  Usually I am rearing to add complexity to our games, but in this instance I wasn't ready to try out the full game until we had played the advanced version 4-5 times.  It was great fun when we finally did.  When you read the directions, the main difference seems to be the addition of another age, but then you realize that losing two people from your population bank each age forces you to really adjust your focus to keeping workers happy and fed.  We both had stretches where we were completely unable to add new workers.  We have only used aggression once, and didn't attempt a war, but simply having the threat of war makes you motivated to not lose the arms race, kind of like the cold war.  We like that aggressiveness is not rewarded but complete weakness is punished.  Its quite a lot to manage to be successful, and the longer game makes it imperative that you grow in a balanced way and aren't stuck with mines or farms or urban building stuck back in antiquity.  The flow of cards is interesting and does give the feel of moving through time.  Playing the full game finally inspired us to upgrade our government, as before it seemed too big a sacrifice.  Yellow cards help when you have failed to sufficiently develop a resource, be it science, food or ore, but there can be long stretches without them and this starts to be less effective the deeper into the game you get.  The event cards and colonies add a whole other dimension, as having colonies can really help you, and it is a joy to expand your empire.  At the same time, you can feel some trepidation at triggering an event, as you may be weak militarily or have your stored food ravaged by rats.  Avoid the event cards though and you miss out on an easy way to rack up additional points.  Their is deep satisfaction in building a wonder, even if it a fast food chain that causes your whole civilization to become obese (presumably).  And if you go too long without a successful leader your society will just feel a little more aimless and lackluster.  Get the right blue technology cards and find yourself swept away in the whirl of progress.  Somehow most of our games end up close, and often one person will be way ahead only to see the other person storm from behind when we score the bonus points at the end.  No lead feels safe, and there are some ways to leverage your weakness, through waves of nationalism if you are week or sabotage if you are bitter at another nations success.  This is so much fun, and as long as it is, I always feel like I don't have enough time at the end as the game keeps on moving along.  Its imperative that you let the other person start their turn while you are clearing out your own turn though or the game starts to drag.  A lot of complex rules that we have occasionally messed up in the past, but I think we are finally getting the hang of this.  A ton of strategy and very fun even if it does make my head spin.

Great civilization game that requires you to balance a lot of different interlocking systems. It manages a great balance between needing to specialize in some aspects of your civilization, while still remaining flexible enough to adapt to your opponents. Every game presents different choices, so it holds up well under repeated plays.

While I like the gameplay very much, it has one drawback of being nearly impossible to catch up and recover from early play mistakes.  Once you fail to acquire a key piece oftechnology, it can set you so far back that you become a spectator for the remaining hour or two of gameplay.

A beast of game but it's rules are quite streamlined.  At it's root it's a card drafting / engine-building game with a strong civ-building theme.  The drafting decisions are intriguing and the game lends itself to multiple victory paths but it's quite time-consuming as is the case with many civ games.  Perhaps with quicker play the game could really shine.  I still haven't played through the wars yet which add a new dimension.  

UPDATE: knocked down half a point -- I like this game but it's too damn fiddly and takes too damn long.  Our group decided to take it online which I'm looking forward to.  2010-11-05

UPDATE: playing online drastically improves the game.  Raised rating back up a point.  In fact I don't think I ever want to play this in person again.  2011-01-04

Have only played this on boardgaming-online.com

Amazing game. Glad I had a BGGer to teach it to me (over skype). I'm looking forward to finding a partner to play it with, over and over. Maybe the wife???? One can dream. Need to learn the fiddliness of the bits as having a computer do it for me has spoiled me a bit.... am sure the boardgame version is vastly superior!

*edit, Oct 2012* This game just gets better the more I play it. Played the actual board version yesterday, it was fun! It is harder to see strategy in the board version due to fiddliness, but having been playing on BGO I've been sort of getting the hang of it. Upped my score to a 10. This game is flawless.

*Feb 2013* Actually got the wife to play it! We played the simple version, which she found overwhelming but not too much, and is willing to explore it again. She won, so that helps (I was falling into my old habits of going long term, whereas winning the simple game uses a different strategy). I'm willing on playing the simple game a few more times with her before moving on to the advanced game. I hope this one is our go-to. Love it.

Vlad's TTA gives you a Civ experience in only a couple hours (a fraction of a Civ time).  The components, gameplay, and mechanics tie in perfectly to the civ-building theme.  Many levels of play (easy game, medium game, long game, etc) to adapt to different time frames / play weights.  Needing only three or four players to do a start-to-end civ game is great fun.

Heaviest game I have ever played (and that says a lot). Most of the people in my group aren't quite experienced enough yet to give this one a go but the ones who can play, should play. Best civ game yet. 

It's complexity makes this game so surreal. Definitely worth it for those who have the time to play its massive full length.

Through The Ages is seriously my top 5 favorite games in my collection. Sadly however, due to its learning curve and ability to reach all those I game with I felt I had to knock off a point from its overall score.

I held off reviewing this until I had quite a few plays under the belt.  The designers have done a fantastic job of capturing the civ experience.   I think this would not be that great of a 4player game (maybe a 3 or 4 rating... at best.   I think the military aspect would end up with someone getting hosed and not having a good time at all), but 2 and 3 player works brilliantly.   At times, I wish there was a way to extend each of the ages with some added cards, but the game just functions so well that anything else might be a detriment... but it is fun to think about.    

Components could easily be better, but it works.  A set of wooden cubes gets rid of the beads.

*********** UPDATE 2009 **************

I have become more convinced that the 4 player game blows and will not be trying that again.  I also think 3 player is slightly better than 2 now.  

**************************************

2 player starting to fall decently behind 3 player.  while much better than 4 player, it is more susceptible to a perfect string of card availability for one player vs the other and can lead to a bit of a runaway.   

3 player is still awesome and one of the best gaming experiences to be found.

Finally revisited this after only trying the simplest version before. Mainly, I was getting annoyed with all the fuzz about Nations, and people kept saying how Nations was a streamlined version of this...

Turns out that this is way better than what I imagined. After the first 2-player game in "simple mode" (we both needed that to get back into it) my wife said something like "hmm, a little short, and are there maybe some more rules?" :D

Well, she did not ask for rules again after the intermediate game but we both greatly enjoyed it. A replay has already been requested!

I should say also: I don't see the appeal of going more than 2 players with this. There *is* the downtime issue.

Only one play through the basic rules so far, but it was very fun.  And I certainly see all the possabilities for this game.  After a second play with 4 players dropped a bit.  A little slow between turns with so many players.  Two were new though so may have been an AP problem.

After several plays I find this a great game.  Plays best with 3, but 2 is ok too.  Michelangelo is definately broken in the basic and advanced game, so we just take him out now.

RATING: 6
I see depth in this game. I love the thematic mechanisms. I understand its fans. I have a single play under my belt and my reaction is very mixed. The first hour was quite enjoyable, but then the downtime mounted, I fell behind in military strength and was repeatedly punished by event cards (no wars), my engine completely stalled out as my population was decimated. I passed entire turns to make tiny progressions in my output or to stick a finger in the dyke.

I want to like this game more, but the time commitment (our 4p game with 3 new players lasted over 6 hours), the consequences of early misplays/unfortunate happenstances, and the dramatic impact of skill differences might make this a non-starter. I plan to try a 2p online game with a similarly skilled opponent as my second play to gain some familiarity and hone my opinion (or at least prepare for the next, if any, live play).

My reticence to commit to another play makes it impossible to rate this higher than a 6, despite my instinct that the game is wonderfully developed.

UPDATE: After half a dozen plays, I'm liking this game less and less. There is no cost or downside to aggressors, so even one point of military supremacy allows players to pin down opponents and force them to choose between a harsh penalty or sacrificing military strength just to remain otherwise unscathed. You either take your lumps or increase the strength divide, which is all the more punishing when the wars occur. In my first play I ignored military. Later I thought I could balance military against economy and culture. Now I don't see any alternative to a pure military strategy. Why generate resources and earn points when you can just bully the other players and take theirs?

Once you fall behind in this game, you can never claw your way back. The leader is continually rewarded with free prizes. This game has ended a very short run with me and I don't see any replayability left. While I acknowledge that there must be *something* here, as it has such loyal fans and the designer is clearly quite clever, for me it's over.

THROUGH THE EXCEL SPREADHSEET. This is an involving, complex game with many good points, but I found it difficult to perceive how well I was doing, and the fact that the game does not visually make it easy to see what is going on does not tally well with my preferences. If I am spending 4+ hours with a game, I would much rather play a war game than this, as I tend to need a map and a better overview of what is going on to grasp how a game is panning out. The small, fiddly bits, and the fact that the tracks are spread out and not as easy to read as they might be are both negatives for me. I'd try it again, but I don't think this is my kind of game - too much abstracted resource management, the theme doesn't always stick. It also lacks interactivity, and the four player game leaves too much of a gap between your turns. I play too fast and my opponents play too slow.

The components are a pain and the game length is still in question for me.  Doesn't really give me what I'm looking for in a civ game ultimately.  Most likely going to trade it.  Traded.  I might give it another chance on the ipad, but I'm not really that optimistic.

RATING: 8.5
Played the basic (simplest version - only 1 age) once, the advanced (two ages) once, and the full game (three ages) once.

This is a ... complicated ... game.  There is a lot to balance, and a lot to explain.  However, the boards are extremely well designed, and once the rules are explained things fall into place and the game is relatively easy to keep track of if you focus.

Long story short, players are attempting to build their civilization by allocating population markers.  Players must track their food production and consumption, resource production, military power, happiness, scientific production, and cultural production simultaneously, all while deciding what new buildings to build and cards to take.  The board design makes this easier than it sounds.

Confusingly, when population makers are used to improve the civilization, they turn into buildings, farms, mines, or military units (depending on where they're used).  Also, the cards that say "Mine" are not actually mines; they're the _technology_ you need to build mines (which you actually build by paying resources and moving a yellow population marker onto the building).  However, once you understand those two items, the game is extremely easy to follow.

There are a lot of rules, and on our first game the simplest version of the game took us a few hours. 

The advanced version adds in a lot of complexity (if you don't keep your people happy they revolt, you can attack other players, etc.), and makes the game much more enjoyable.  However, if you're starting out, for the love of all that's good in the universe please start out with the simple version: the advanced would be insane.

The game feels like it should have a lot of replayability, since the order the technology cards comes out in dictates a lot of what's possible (and valuable) during the game.  

The full game (all three ages) takes a LONG time to play - our first game of that length was nearly 6 hours long.  It was a great 6 hours, and it was enthralling enough that I didn't realize it was taking that long, but it was still ... long.  But the game is best with all three ages, no doubt (as you have the full ability to upgrade technologies, and can really take different paths to victory).  

[Update: rating up to 8.5 after playing the advanced version]

Runaway leader can be a problem, so we always play with the rule that you can forfeit after every age.

Played it solo twice on tabletop, umpteen times on BGO.  I liked this more when I first started playing it.  I think what turned it sour for me was playing competitively online and seeing extreme strategies being employed successfully that made no thematic sense.  I'm now too prone to playing this the same way each time I play.  The opening is mapped out for me, the ending is mapped out for me, the only real decision I'm making is whether or not to go all out military in the middle.  And if I don't play each turn with perfectly efficiency I will lose.  And this doesn't even get into the components, with artwork I don't care for, player tableaus with spots for only about half of your cards, a gigantic scoring track that should be replaced by a scoring pad and pencil, those damn tiny dots to slide around, and the overall fiddliness of the game.  I can't ever imagine getting this played in full outside of BGO, and for that alone I don't understand its lofty ranking on BGG.

Update: TRADED.  Couldn't get excited to play this again.

Solid game.  The game is a huge balancing act.  Leave one aspect behind and it seems it will come back to haunt you regardless.  Seems to go a bit quickly.  Not the Civ-killer it was touted as being but fun in its own right.

-- Still convinced it may be too fast - plus it doesn't really have an answer for the question of military "piling on" when one player falls behind once an arms race has begun.

Traded off.  The more I played it the less I liked it.  It doesn't feel epic to me.  Not the way Advanced Civilization does.  It's a solid game, just not for me.

The game presents lots of choices and despite having a good number of actions, I never feel like I can do enough making each choice important. For me, this and the sense of accomplishment I get looking at my civilization at the end really make this a game I'll keep coming back to. Length of play can be quite long; not a problem for my group but it may prevent it from coming to the table as often as I'd like.

I waited a long time for the 3rd edition to come out.. and it's finally here! I love this game, as I expected to, even though I've yet to finish a full game. I did a horrible job teaching it to my wife and am experiencing some resistance. She's a fan of Civilization IV for the PC, and she's not crazy about the prospect of no map. She's also not crazy about all the upkeep and bean counting - stuff she's used to the computer managing. So far we've played half a game and stopped due to mounting rules mistakes, however she has expressed interest in trying again. I think it will catch on. Also, it's a long game, which for me is fine, but my wife, not so much. Still, what a game! Love it!

Very clever in theory, the way the system is abstracted is very neat and lovely. In practise, though, I seem to enjoy the game less the more I play it. The power of military seems overly strong and the military dominates the game.

The online game at Boardgaming Online is nice, though. On board, the game is a bit too fiddly, lots of small markers to move around and cards to handle.

So, I'm dropping my rating from 9 to 7. Still a good game, just not as great as I once thought it was.

Indifferent.

Rating tentative after first play. I was highly intrigued by the game in there but the rulebook was an abomination against clarity, and we stumbled through a "simple" game in about three hours without ever having a clear sense if we were playing correctly. I definitely would like to try this again, and I suspect my rating might go up.

==========

Ratings downgrade after several plays of the FFG Sid Meier's Civ reprint. There is simply too much micromanagement and not enough direct conflict in this to be a genuine Civ game. And given how long it takes to play, how fiddly it is (ludicrously fiddly) and how easy it is to get important and easily overlooked rules wrong, I think I will stick with the FFG Civ and let the eurogamers wank away at this one without me.

Military is definitely the game-winning strategy, and that's too bad.  You just can't win without it, and because it's so important, all else in the game pales in comparison.  Military wins events which net victory points, military wins colonies which give all-important extra token, military wins wars which can swing the game 40-60 points in a single turn (and often does).  Fall behind in military and you will probably lose.  You don't have to have the best military in the end, but chances are high that you'd better have the best military through a good chunk of the game, or you'll lose for sure.

Through the Ages is a decent game, and I can see why it is so appealing. I'd certainly play it again and would seriously consider purchasing a digital version that took care of the fiddly bookkeeping and had a strong AI.

However, as a game for my own collection, it doesn't really fit. A resource management and engine-building game at its core, Through the Ages does not, in my opinion, outdo [boardgame=31260][/boardgame], but takes twice as long for what I deem to be a similar experience. While it adds a layer of light conflict in, I'd rather go all out with [boardgame=9625][/boardgame] for a truly epic multi-player conflict game. Furthermore, [boardgame=62219][/boardgame], while nothing like Through the Ages, seems to mix these elements together in a more satisfying way for me. With only so much interest in 3+ hour games, Through the Ages is the odd man out.

In addition, although I am drawn to the civ theme, I don't really get the appeal of Christopher Columbus leading your civilization for 600 years while building the Taj Mahal and the Kremlin, among other goofy combinations. Not a big deal, but it's another hindrance to me diving into the game.

Jury still out-- could be a good one, but lots of fiddly little wooden pieces and somewhat drab counting board make it kind of hard to get excited about for me. Also, like many civ-building games,  takes a long time to play, with some down time, leading to concerns about "bang for the buck."

RATING: 8
Took me most of a game to understand everything that was happening, but it wasn't explained that well to me.  Still I enjoyed it a lot and would like to try it again. Didn't feel too long (I think we only played the Simple Game). 3-7-10

Played my second game, the full version, online.  This time I read all the rules myself and though I had to go back to them once or twice it wasn't too bad.  I enjoyed the game, appreciated the strategy and have been thinking a lot about picking this one up. I'm just afraid it might be pretty fiddly with all the little pieces and I wonder how long it would take in person.  But it seems like a great game and worth all the attention. 5-30-12

Third game, 2 player, advanced game, live.  Won with Michealangelo, St. Peter's, and Taj Majal.  Enjoyed it but it was a lot of game, took 3-4 hours and that's just with 2 although we did check the rules quite a bit.  It could play faster if people knew what they were doing but it's still a long game and it may be more game than I can regularly get to the table.  Turns are long while everyone's figuring out what to do with their actions and there isn't a ton of stuff to figure out before hand although you can have a general plan.  Still, a great game. 6-27-12

A very intriguing game that I badly want to like.  However, the downtime between turns is a major issue for me.  I'm sure that would be better if you played the game with the same group all the time and played a lot.  But that's not how I get to play it.  Still, a very good to great game.

RATING: 3
With such a high rating, I was sure I would like this civilization building game.  Two things sent this game to the trade pile - its complexity and fiddliness.  I've played many complex games but the difference here was that the rules and gameplay didn't follow logically from the theme.  The upkeep of the little pieces just seemed to be work.  Grabbing a card or two off of the assembly line of cards marching across the board did not make me feel like I was building a vast civilization such as I feel when playing Advanced Civilization.  My search for a shorter version of an Advanced Civilization-type game continues.

I love Civ games, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. It's an engine-building, multiplayer solitaire game.  A lot of fiddly book keeping but no drama or pace.  While the whole design contains some neat ideas, a player could get as much entertainment from doing his or her taxes as playing this game.  And if anyone has the Civ games on PC, why wouldn't they just play those instead?

The game is good and I still enjoy playing it, but I sold it because I don't really have time nor people to play it anymore. The people I would play this with have it.

I haven't seen a better civ boardgame, there enough going on to give satisfaction without becoming unwieldy. Sometimes I think the card market is too tactical and random where it makes planning ahead moot. But the most skilled player who isn't me usually wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Now THIS is a game!  Yes, it is fiddly and there are a lot of things to keep track of after each turn (the various tracks, feeding, production/corruption, etc.).  Typically at the end of the game I have a headache, and I assume it's because my brain never stops working -- either I'm planning my next move or I'm making sure I didn't forget one of the fiddly end-of-turn steps.

But the game itself is fantastic.  Many paths to victory.  Meaningful, non-obvious decisions that never stop.  A feeling of satisfaction as you watch your civilization improve more and more with each passing turn.

Only downsides: I don't like all of the end-of-round maintenance that occurs, as there's enough to break my concentration and take me 'out of the game' for a minute.  And the game takes so long to play that I don't get to play it as much as I'd like.  But the game itself is wonderful.

Update: Lowered the rating.  I still love the game, but ultimately it's a bit too long & fiddly for my tastes now, so it's just not getting as much play as it used to.

One of those rare games that actually delivers on all that it promises.

This is the premier civ building game in my opinion. The lack of a board only helps it to shine. Military may not hold as important a place as a conflict game, but it still plays an important enough role to require attention.

The technologies, wonders, scientific advancement and leaders are all present in great numbers and the game will never play the same twice due to player choices and card distribution.

The science element is a major winner for me and whilst some of the token movement and allocation may appear fiddly at first, it is fairly intuitive and only takes 1 play to fully grasp. Quite simply a game that mimicks a classic like Civ for the PC couldn't work without a little micro management.

My first game went for 7 hours. This will come down by about 2.5 hours with another play or two. Despite that I hardly noticed the time go by and my wife...yes my wife...(this is not sexist...rather Patty does not like games beyond 3 hours as a general rule)said the same.

One play and I had to own it. Truly awesome.

This is a pretty good and interesting game.  However, it is a "heavy" (deep) game that takes at least 4 hours to play and can be brutally tough.  If you don't have a dedicated group that is willing to play this game at least 3 times within a 3 month time period, don't even bother with this game.  Because there is a LOT to digest, and playing it every once in a while is just a waste of time, since you won't grasp some of the game concepts and mechanisms.

Although it is a card driven game, the theme is decent.  A bit too long and tough.  This takes away from the fun factor, and limits how often it would be brought to the table, and ONLY for hard core gamers.

Update:
After 3 dozen plays of the 'FULL' game (online) my rating drops from 9 to 7.5.  Good game, but unforgiving for those who have fallen behind militarily (sometimes through no fault of their own).  Game has a luck/skill ratio that is not quite right for a heavier game of this length.  

Resigning from the game is a real option, bringing into question game balance.  It also makes for an unsatisfying gaming experience due to the lack of return on time invested.

Note: Best played online.

Update 2:  Another 500 (online) plays, and I'm obviously enjoying the game and coming back for more punishment.  Even with the above mentioned flaws, I gotta raise my rating back to a 8.5.

Here is a question never top ask me, because it ramps my GTP to infinity:
"Which one do you like more TTA or sidM Civ?"

Now I would still recommend SidM Civ. It's prettier (ameritrash, yes yes, FF does what it does best), the map and variation in it, it's combat is, well, kinda more fun and the various civ's add more flavor, though if you go "pro" with it, certain house rules needed to be added especially if you want it to last a bit longer (well like adding a variant such as - no technology victory etc.)

But if you want a game that is solid mechanically with no house rule requirement and no "this is civ/combo is way OP" comments, go TTA.

I love this game however score it lower because of the randomness of the future event cards in age three.  Because of them the game is a bit squirly in the final scoring, which is frustrating in a 5 hour game to come down to whowever got lucky drawing a few cards.

This has been replaced by Nations at this point. I can respect TTA's design, but somehow I think the entirety of mankind's history can be streamlined down from this.

Nations replaces this for me.

Just played 2 player simple game last night. I had a Very good first impressions. It seems to be a really great game. I hope to play the advance and full game very soon. Probably this rating will raise to a 9.

21/02/08Ok, this time i played all the way trough. The game is colossal, difficult but very balanced, with many paths to victory and a million things to do in your turn. This is a great great game. So instead of a 9 I had rise it to a 10. For some people, the long time that it takes to play (4   hours) is a problem, but not for me, so i rate it a 10. Friday i will play the full game again with 4 players. Let's see if that 10 will stand or fall.

23/02/2008
Still a 10. One of this days, I promise that I will learn how to play this game. :)Magnificent.

Another great session, but this time I had to put down my rate to a 8.5 due the following things:
1-To many downtime when someone reach the 8 or 9 civil actions per turn.
2-A very solitary game.
3-After 4 games, the end was the same again. The last war is to powerful.

I've always been skeptical towards games that claim to be civilization games without boards. When I finally got to try the King of civilization games according to the Boardgamegeek list my prejudices were confirmed. I can see that there is a game where you draw and place cards to build combinations to improve your civilization in various aspects. However, I just can't see a civilization for all the cards and I prefer the similar but simpler Nation to this fiddly affair.

How a civ game with cards only and no map to explore can be on the top list of the board games?That is the main question of many and myself,until recently,about Through the Ages.Well,I've played it and loved it instantly.Some may not like it because of the lack of map exploration but I don't mind at all.It is so well designed that keeps you on the edje every single round.The micromanagment of your civilization and how you will make him even better is a constant battle in your brain and a puzzle you keep fighting to solve every single round.And if you want interaction with your opponents the military card deck provides you with plenty wars and aggresive actions to make them struggle even more.A great,great game!!!

Ugh. Card games are supposed to play smoothly. This plays anything but. Fiddliness abound here. Add lousy bits and painful downtime (in a 4 player advanced game anyway) and the end result is several hours of drudgery in a game so undeserving of its $70 price tag.

Cannot get this game out of my head - want to play it all the time.  Only played it a couple of times so far and not even a Full Game yet, but the execution is absolutely beautiful to behold.  Can't say enough good things about this game at the moment...

Update:

Sam and his bro came over last night and we started our first ever Full Game version of Through the Ages.  OMG.  It took SIX AND A HALF HOURS!!!  :surprise:

Admittedly Sam's bro is not a 'gamer' like us, but he did well and came in second by the end of the game.  I was first, which may have affected my overall feeling of the game being absolutely brilliant.  Totally up my street.  And to be honest the difference in our two lead scores wasn't that great: 122 to 115 after all those hours of nail biting gaming, with poor Sam trailing at 85.  His own fault though, he started launching aggressions early on, which meant we all had to militarily escalate quickly.  At which point retribution came thick and fast!

Totally great game though, jumped to my current top spot even though right now I feel like I could lay down and die - they didn't leave until 2.45am...  :zombie:

Played it ten times now and this has rightly become the holy grail of civilization builder games, in my opinion.  Simple mechanisms...a card game basically, no map and super fun to play.  The simple game is simple and quick, but the advanced and full games are what my rating is for.  The scope is wonderful and the game play is exciting and just about as good as it can get for me. Rules are in perfect English and very clear even though the game was designed in the Czech Republic.  Art work is fabulous and the quality of the box and contents and rules is very high.  Found at Essen in 2006 and helped the 2nd edition become a reality.  Now that I can play it easily on Board Game Arena, I like it even more.

This game easily could be a 10. It may end up that way for me eventually. I've never seen a game that had so many checks and balances on everything. I genuinely feel like I'm managing a civilization with every move I take. This is mechanic design at it's finest. The game is long. But I find myself wishing the game was longer on occasion because I didn't get to unlock some technology, or hadn't finished building my wonder perhaps. I started playing Sid Meiers Civ games on the computer and wanted something that felt like that in a board game. Here it is. And it's shorter than a game of Civ. I have two questions, one big and one less important. Why does the game have to be this ugly to look at? And the big one, WHY WOULD YOU USE ROUND WOODEN MARKERS? Jesus...

Might be my most disappointing game ever.  This was a game that, when I saw it, got me hyped to dive head long into this hobby.  Got the game, then it sat forever thanks to a rough rulebook.  I finally get it to the table after almost 18 months and 'thud.'  Fell flat and felt like a chore.  I think my sweet spot with heavier euros are games with a few mechanisms but tons of depth.  Sad this game missed, but it was a miss nonetheless.  Sold at DTC 2016.

Through the Ages is a really remarkable game.  I really enjoy playing it, and I find that I can't stop thinking about it when I'm not playing it.  For me, it is a fantastic 2-player game to play at lunch at work.  My buddy and I can get through about an age a day, and at this speed the game is absolutely wonderful.  I really enjoy the engine building aspect of this game, trying to make my civilization as capable as I can.  I have yet to really flex my military muscle, but I feel that there's a lot of potential there too.

The game does have some downtime issues with more players, and it is fiddly as all hell.  The little round markers roll everywhere, which is not my favorite, but despite all this I still really love this game.  The fact that it plays really well with 2 and with 3, which are my two most common play group sizes, is a real bonus.  I'm very glad that I was able to get this game, and I think this is one that I'll enjoy playing for a long time.

The modern civilization game. No board to conquer, no armies to battle against... lots of though calls and fun inside this little box. Probably increases its rating after the complete game.

Despite the 4 hours it takes to play, this game is awesome. This is the most difficult game I've played so far (as 21/05/2009), and it challenges me in a way I've never been challenged before for a game.  I would love to play this game every week. A solid 9, almost like a 10... if it wouldn't last for that much time. What I'm sure of, is this game is going right into my top 10.

07/07/2010: Not only this game has reached my top 10, but now it's one of my 3 favorites. The perfect 10.

04/03/2013: After playing many games (mostly online), I've decided that this is no longer a top 10 game. It all comes down to the better execution of the military strategy. If you don't plan ahead the military race, you will face an overwhelming force taking away your culture points.  I still think this is a great game, but it drove itself outside my hall of fame.

A superb, very involving game and also feels like a real simulation of civilization growth. It is very long however, but needs the Full Game format. Excellent with 2,3 and 4 players.

It is hard to summon up the effort to get this one out and concentrate on all those little pieces.  Needs a group of people willing to learn and play it together.  I didn't like it as  2 player.  Traded as it was never going to be played, let alone played enough.

Playing a bit now on BGO and it is better but still cumbersome.

I played the full game with four players.  None of us had played it before.  It ran on a bit long: 2 hours to read the rules, and another 8 to play out the game.  I thought there were lots of interesting decisions to be made, and building up your civilization is enjoyable.  I think I didn't place enough emphasis on long term planning or on getting early culture rating points.

Best civilization building board game I have played. It has some flaws though and it is really unforgiving to new players. Free tip: make sure you do not have the lowest military! What I like about this game is that skill plays a huge part in it. The better player wins almost every single time. The problem with the game is that it rewards beating down already losing players. It's common to see everyone raid one player over and over again, without him being able to do anything about it.

Players are drafting cards from a row. Some cards cost an action point to take, others take two action points, and some take three. You start the game with 4 action points (called civic actions). The cards start in the antiquity age, and go through ages I to III. You watch your civilization evolve in this time period. Cards consist of leaders, wonders or technologies. For instance, an antiquity leader is Moses, who helps your farming production. You draft cards, then play them according to their cost.So far so good, this sounds like St. Petersburg, you say. Each player also has a mat, with tokens which keep track of population and resources. Most cards generate VPs, technology, happiness, increase military strength, etc. Most cards don't generate abilities unless there is a worker on it. Workers can be produced on farms, and resources for the worker are generated on mines. It usually cost a number of resources to move a worker to a card. Now, one has to balance their workers, resources and happiness level. If a player does not have enough happiness, then workers revolt and a player will not produce resources. A player also has to pay a corruption cost for more resources they consume. So one has to watch out for not overproducing and finding an even balance.Now, thrown into this game is the military (dubbed the political action) phase. There is a military deck of cards, where players can draw cards. These cards consist of war/aggression cards (attacking your neighbour), event cards, defence cards or colonize cards. In the early ages, if you are stronger than your opponent, then you can attack them to gain resources, or permanently take away their resources. The event cards, benign at the very beginning, then favor the stronger military who gains something, and the weakest military usually loses something. **** I really like the drafting cards aspect of the game. I like thinking about the special powers and what you can do. However, the military part of the game, I dislike. It's not my type of game, since the weakest military player will get pounded. There is no mercy, since it is to the advantage of the stronger military to declare war or play aggression against a much weaker opponent, since victory is virtually assured. Thus, I have a love/hate feeling towards this game. I definitely have to be in the right frame of mind to play. The event cards each turn can feel random and can cause grief to the person who is the weakest. It also takes around 4-6 hrs to complete a game, and does not play well at all with 4 players. So I really like one aspect of the game, the civilization part, but I dislike the military aspect of the game. The military aspect doesn't suit my personality. But I suppose one can adapt. 

To be fair, this game plays best as an online implementation. Face to face, it takes a long time. It plays better online. Still, it seems you have to spend some effort on military, so it tends to limit the range of variety you can try. It's fairly impossible to ignore military completely, which would be a nice option to try, but you would get picked on. I've mainly played this as 3 player, and with another person potentially attacking you, then it can skew some games in favour of someone else. Sure, you say, build up your military, which you have to do, and it would be nice if there other options to that. It's a decent game, but not a top tier game for me. I like how the cards are phased so they come out in certain eras That has been designed well. But the attacking with military just isn't my style of game.

RATING: 10
Certainly takes a few plays to get to grips with, but right from the outset you can see the potential!  The rules are poorly written (up there with the worst!), ambiguous and wordy, but worth soldiering through.

The (major) downside is the time taken - particularly if you have people taking time mulling over decisions.

UPDATE: We've got faster so the game is up to a 10. It helps if you can trust your opponent to score whilst you have your go. You need to make sure you are planning as much as you can during your opponents turn. Otherwise the downtime is painful.

All my other games seems to pale into insignificance since we've started playing this! LOVE it!

Seems very clever the first time you play it. However, further plays reveal that: 1) the cards play you, rather than the other way around; 2) military is far, far too important (but also swingy thanks to relying on random card draws - and borderline broken when someone who already has a slight edge then gets to take Napoleon before anyone else can), and 3) that the game is a little long and fiddly for what it is.

Emphatically replaced by superior reimplementation 'Nations'.

RATING: 8.5
Very deep and satisfying civilization building game that is packed with difficult trade offs and gives a nice sense of accomplishment. On the other hand, its a long game that encourages everyone to beat on the player with the weakest military with limited mechanisms for that player to come back into the game. Getting off to a poor start can lead to a 3 hours of punishment in a game you have been effectively eliminated from.

Chv√°til best strategic game. A Very good civilization game. A suspensive growing of the own civilization! Only the downtime could be shorter. 
This game is only for gamers. You need minimal one time (ca. 4h) to explain the rules, and an other (again 4h), to find out that you make a lot of mistakes. But this game is worth the candle. Gamers will have a lot of fun, action and suspense with this game! 10 Points from me for this heavy optimasing game.

Clearly outclassed by Nations, Clash of Cultures, and especially Sid Meier's Civilization:  The Board Game.  The ideas and concepts at work here are still mostly solid, and there is a certain elegance to it, but the ease with which one player can become a human punching bag for three hours, constantly losing the very resources required to fight back, put it very low on the civ-lite totem pole.

I really want to like this game (I'm a big fan of Sid Meier's Civ PC games from the beginning), but it just feels like an exercise in accounting to me. I don't feel like I'm following a story of civilization... I feel like I'm crunching numbers. I know many games come down to this number-crunching, but Through the Ages is just too long, and after a couple of hours I'm pretty much worn out. I haven't played this with 2 yet, so I'm hoping that faster play and more ability to develop a strategy will help to make the game show me why so many people love it so much.

It didn't get the best-game-ever rating that I wanted it to have off of the first play, but it was pretty damn good.  Excellent excellent resource management game with a theme I love, but it definitely takes a good chunk of time to play - at least at first.  Hopefully I can play this enough to get the play time down to a respectable length, but the 120  listed on the box is just a joke.  The emphasis is definitely on the  !

---update--
Two more games - skip 9 and go straight to 10.  Play time is reasonable once you get used to the flow of things (and play by the correct rules!).  Seems to play well with both 2 and 3.  Looking forward to playing a Full game (all games are advanced, so far), but not so certain about playing with 4 players.

--update--
Full game has been played and it is good.  Very enjoyable and a reasonable length - four hours with three players, one of which was new.  This one has most certainly got legs.

Staggeringly clever mechanics make the broad brush of history come to life in this game. Crucial are the early proper management of your mining and agricultural resources. 

The bloke who owned the game launched us newbs straight into the advanced game and seemed to enjoy himself, rubbing his chin and thinking while doling out advice here and there. I layed the foundations of my demise by sporting whizz bang scientific output in period 2 backed by only stone age mines. Snapping up the Gandhi leader card was all that saved me from annihilation.

War is cleverly simulated via cards, with the results of a campaign being, fittingly, economic plunder or the enemies' loss of cultural prestige.

Enjoy this satisfying epic with coffee.

RATING: 10
There is a subtle economy that underlies this game. Games like Puerto Rico, Agricola, RftG, Hansa Teutonica and Le Havre have obvious engines to build to grow your power. Generally, you need more actions to break open an advantage against an opponent. TTA is not as intuitive. Monarchy, for example, is a poor investment though it gives you that additional action advantage.

Winning in TTA is an exercise in bleeding a rock. The advantages you slowly gain are so subtle that they often cannot be fully comprehended until late in the game.

There does seem to be a few prevailing strategies, but the game remains deliciously tactical. Not a 10 because the time commitment is steep and I can't say I would want to play it always at any time.

Being a huge fan of Civilization on the PC, I really wanted to like this game. I did like it, but the only thing is the time it took to play. I could see getting it down to 4 hours, but that would require a dedicated group of people to play it consistently. This just wouldn't happen for me.

RATING: 5
Just me, or do the aggression cards seriously imbalance the game? In a game with this high of a reputation, it strikes me as very odd that players can tamper with each others' bits to the extent allowed by the cards -- effectively doubling one player's turn while setting the other's back by the same -- a triple advantage, all from luck of the draw. If there is a next time, I'll have to see if the no aggression variant might redeem this somewhat stinker. And what is up with the incredibly tiny rectangles in the score track? How many times, when sliding the cards left, do the score markers move left as well?

3 player game, from start to finish with rules explanation took 7 hours, that alone dooms this game for me. I would rather play two or three other meaty games in the same amount of time it takes to play this one. Hence the rating. The rules are much more complex than that of an average gamer's game, and there's lots of downtime. Can't really plan your actions until it is your turn. There are a lot of different cards, which makes it very diffcult to see the game as a whole initially, but ensure replayability. If you don't mind the above, and willing to invest the time, than it is an interesting system.

Should be a really nice game, but the pick-on-the-loser-until-they-quit-and-get-to-watch-people-play-the-game-for-hours mechanic is just awful. Also, a bad shuffle (say, one where the first oil is the first cards, but the last two are the last two cards [something that happened in our game]) makes the person who happens to grab the oil the run-away winner. It is cool to see how a civ game can work without a map.

Smooth civ building game. I like the flow, it doesn't feel like any of the advances or anything are forced. After only one play, I don't really have a great feel for the attacking aspect, but I think it would come into play much more after more experience at the game. That said, falling behind can be unpleasant since the trailer tends to get beaten up by any of the event cards. Tip for next time, keep military power equal!

It's a great game, no doubt.

I now compare it to Nations, and that is a bit unfair, because Nations is a blatant copy of TTA, more streamlined.

The biggest problem is the playing time, something quite common in this genre. Even if I admit that TTA could be a better game than Nations, I would choose to play Nations because of the playing time.

Another possible issue: people keeps telling me its too militaristic. I only played the Peaceful version.

First impressions (3, 4 players Adv. game) : The core game itself isn't that complicated but because of pretty high abstraction level and plenty of fiddly rules it feels complex. The game is heavy resource management game and quite rewarding one I must admit. My only complain really is the length. My rating is for 3 player Adv. game. Add one more player and rating will drop by 1-2 because of added length. Same might apply to the full game if it also adds enough to the game length. I'm in no hurry to try "full" game because of this.

I enjoy this a great deal, it's a civ game that works on one level-- resource management. It lacks a sort of epic 'feel' I'd expect from a game about the rise of a civilization, there's no 'drama' in it. That having been said, it's good at what it does, and has a decent amount of interaction and some good opportunities for conflict. My other main problem tends to be 'runaway leader' syndrome, it can be impossible to recover if you've taken a beating. Experience may win out over that issue, and I'm certainly willing to play a few more times to see if that's the case.

A great civilization game. There's some maintenance overhead but otherwise the game runs quite smoothly, and feels a lot shorter than it is. Too long with four, great with two, and at its best with three.

The new American edition has serious production quality issues. The materials used in cards and the box are of typical Chinese bad quality. Usability has been downgraded as well: The player pieces are cylinders (!) and worst of all, the two game boards have been merged, meaning that you are continuously knocking around the scoring tokens every time you handle the cards. Also, putting the choking hazard sign on the top cover is absolutely ridiculous.

I wanted to like this game but after one play I just cannot. If there ever was a fiddly game this is it: very large number of small cards with text on them and tiny pieces that are moved from one place to another. On their turns players need to go through several new cards and ponder whether they suit their purposes. Fiddlines is not the only thing wrong with the game. It takes a huge amount of time for what it is. It is also very linear and there is nothing to do when it is not your turn. There are no negotiations and no player interactions to speak of. I found it even hard to follow what others were doing on their turn. The downtime really killed this game for me. However, the scope of the game is most impressive and I have to admit that the game is rather well designed so I can see others enjoying it. What I am trying to say is this is not my cup of coffee. Though, I am ready to give it another go someday. Hopefully it works better for me then.

I originally rated this a "9" after a few plays, but it has quickly dropped in my esteem.

I almost feel like the designers tried too hard to make the game balanced.  That is, there are too many counterbalances to over-expansion, in the form of corruption, starvation, etc.  After a while it starts to feel very fiddly and a little too much like book-keeping.  I often find myself asking, "shouldn't some sort of computer be doing all this end of turn stuff?"  I also wish that there was more player interaction, other than military actions and taking cards from the line.  

That said, there are still a lot of things I like about this game, and I'd be happy to play it again with experienced players.  I just don't feel like teaching it to anyone new anymore.

In Through the Ages players fight for the biggest amount of culture produced since the dawn of organized civilization, going through all ages until today during a few hours. Civil and military events appear, as well as important figures in history and key technological or intellectual developments.

As a game in itself, it is supposed to be not only the ultimate distillation of the civilization genre (due to its stripped-down, card-driven system for marking both events and developments) but also a game in which the worker placement mechanic gets pushed to its very limit: counters measure a huge range of variables including achieving wonders, building all sorts of infrastructure, establishing military or government models and last but not least different types of resources. To add the right amount of luck, cards are drafted from a line.

The end result is as dense as the two previous paragraphs: a game that manages to be compact within its scope but still offer a huge amount of information to deal with. Its learning curve is not particularly steep (it takes a simple game to know how to move forward) but very long: there are loads of possible combinations of cards, loads of different strategies to try out, loads of possible choices even during a single turn... Through the Ages is no light fare at all, nor something to be played just once every half a year - to fully appreciate all the intricacies in its design, it demands continued, full immersion.

My kind of game. Our first play was with 4 new players (1 had played once) playing the full game. I probably wouldn't recommend that. We did it primarily as a learning game, knowing we would not finish. Also, since the rules differ between the three types, it's just easier for us learning the whole thing all at once. At 4 players, I think the game can be a little too long. The cards don't cycle through fast enough. It seems with 2 that they cycle too fast. 3 sounds just about right.

Update 9 -> 10. It's pretty much all we are playing right now - even more than my REAL favorite: Agricola! :-(

Takes very much time. Lots of rules. After some time you cannot entertain much especially if your score is far from best one. It took 5.5-6.5 hours in my twice game 3 player and 4 player. Spending that much time in only one game makes you tired. Positive points are game is well balanced, everything is included, wonders, leaders. Again one more negative point is player boards needs attachable parts, calculating culture, science scores are problematic and players can forget easily adding some of them, each round you have to make much calculation and you have lots of responsibility. Overall it's score is 6.2 for now. I do not think this game should stay in top ten list.

Very good mechanics. Very good setting. Quite good graphics. Interesting and innovative mechanics. There is a war system and there are many ways to try to stop the winner, but everything without reducing the game to a "all against him".

Only some minor problems: 
- that damned little round tokens which go around everywhere, 
- THE SCORE TRACK WHICH IS SMALLER THAN THE SCORE TOKENS
- very intricate to explain to new players, which act as punching balls for the first 10 games

However, its 2-4 hours flow smoothly and without losing time or having to wait too much between turns.

UPDATE AFTER MORE THAT 200 face-to-face games and more than 100 online games: the game is even more interesting than before. Now its only drawback are players whose strategy is war-war-war-and-nothing-else who can turn it into a draw-the-right-tactic game... but experienced players learn how to deal with them!

UPDATE AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS: new edition has solved the first two problems. Its only single problem now remains that I need an entire afternoon to explain it to a new player, only having him able to follow the rules without any competitive strategy.

RATING: 7.8
Surprisingly, not sure about this game...

- Card knowledge is key.
- The bits should have been pegboards.
- The game feels like it shouldn't take that long, but I think that all of the damn fiddliness contributes heavily to that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Really, my only negative comments to this wonderful game are that it takes a while between turns (play with 3) and that the little bits are really fiddly. Those things are nothing to how fun it is. Build your civ up, decide which paths of victory to take, watch so that your opponents don't become too powerful militarily, and hope that someone doesn't take that card you REALLY want!

With further plays, I have encountered an issue. There are wild swings with certain cards and with winning or losing a war. I addition, there are end game cards that are really overpowered.  One game I led 2nd place by 30 points with 2 turns left and ended up in LAST in a 4 player game!!

That said, the game is so fun to play I can only deduct a half point for it's drawbacks and still consider it one of the best games of all time.

Played the original edition only once - in December 06 - and based on that one playing, this game went straight to the top of my wishlist. I've now, FINALLY (Feb 08), managed to get a copy of the 2nd edition. Can't wait to play it again. The reason I've not rated it, is because I can't remember enough about that one game played all that time ago...
Edit: played the "advanced version of the game, and loved it. My only concern is that it is a little too long to fit in an evening. At the moment at least. Hopefully that will change with more playings..

03/2010:
Amazing, absolutely amazing! 

I know one should be careful with superlatives, but the moment I'm writing these lines I feel that TtA might be the best game I have played so far.

UPDATE 05/2010:
I realized that I frequently miss some player interaction, especially after having played FFG's Civilization. The way it is, I'm actually more in love with that civilization building theme than with the game play. 
I highly admire the streamlined implementation of the complex relationships between resources, population, happiness, military etc into simple mechanisms. TtA is a master piece. It feels wonderful to play that game, yet I just think it could be better SOMEHOW. 

Another point: with 4 players, downtime really becomes an issue. I would say it's best with 3. 

Rating dropped by 1.

In all honesty: The game is filled with things I avoid. If it wasn't for the outstandinly immersed Civilization theme, that game would hardly be a 6 in my book. 

HOUSE RULES CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION
- 2 political actions per turn
- pacts may be negotiated
- pacts may be cancelled for free after agressions and/or wars between the respective civilizations
- in case of agressions and/or wars, third civilizations may support one side via bonus cards if they sacrifice at least one unit. Third civilizations may be bribed to give support (resources, technologies, food)
- military row

This game has a learning curve, and it is going to be tougher to get to the table than some of the other games that I have rated this highly. I loved civilization building games on the computer when I was younger, and this provides that same feel for me.

First play - only played through 2 turns of a simple game with my wife.  She didn't love it, which means it may literally be a year or two before I play.  

Second play - 10+ months later: Played with my bro-in-law who loves board games and Civ on the computer.  We both really liked it, but he commented more than once how slow it was.  He wants to try it again because we believe we can speed it up a lot, but I'm worried because it did drag a little.  Very compelling, but a LOT of little disc pushing around.  

My wife won't like this.  If my bro-in-law does after another try, I'll get 1 or 2 plays a year...  Maybe I should just get Risk: Legacy for a game I'll also rarely play, but we won't forget all the rules in between...

RATING: 10
Holy crap is this game ever amazing.  I know, I know - I sound like a fanboy - but in this case it's true.  If you like economic engine / snowball type games, this is very nearly the pinnacle of the genre, giving you a massive sandbox in which to play.

While the key requirements the game throws at you are constant for all players (keep your people fed and happy, keep your military competent and keep your production as large and efficient as possible), the ways the civs develop will diverge sharply thanks to the types of Leaders those civs have and what kinds of Wonders the civs build.  Add to that the variety of tech upgrades you can invest in and the random nature of how the techs become available and you have a game with tremendous replayability - I don't see a single 'killer combo' which neuters all others yet, although I haven't played the game often enough to be sure.

There is also just enough randomness in the game - although it's randomness the players have a say in - to keep players off-balance and having to prepare for the unexpected.  Single-minded pursuits of victory points will often leave a player stuck as some unforseen event wreaks havoc with carefully-laid plans.

I've played the game several times, including 3+ Full Games now, and don't see wanting to stop playing anytime soon. Upped my rating to a 10 - it's that good.

Update: I've played 10+ times now and no end in sight for my enjoyment of this game. One of my 5 favourite games of all time.

Played only on tablet and online. Very interesting game. Little fiddly managing all the actions. War (or defending against it) seems too strong, never knowing what aggression cards your opponent drew. Comes a little with luck of the cards drawn. Alliances and trade are weakly implemented. Too bad the game takes so long.

27/1/2010 - I would really like to enjoy this. I tried twice. Wonderful mechanics, but it's not for me. Two many rules and details, etc. I love depth like in Chess or Tigris: a few rules, thousands of ways to play.

29/11/2010 - Tried again. Same feelings. I can't feel the theme, the details are very frustrating, it's not for me, I won't play again.

A great game which has a lot to offer.
Variety of cards and card appearance makes for replayability.

There is a lot to manage, different resources that need to be balanced or you will suffer the consequences from your neighbours.

Military strength is a must, which does not appeal to me.
Actually is a race of who can handle the best army, the rest of the game is just to support it. Ignore your army strength and you're out.

Cons:
I just don't see the theme anywhere.
The playtime is too long. Absurd.
A long steep learning curve. Not worth the time.

Amazing, subtle game. Long for what it is, which is funny because normally you'd call a 4 hour civ-builder an unqualified success. I guess I don't feel like it's really a full civ-building experience. But man...it is a work of art. Highest possible recommendation. Loses 0.5 due to the fast that mastery is everything in this game, and small errors in play can lead to three+ hours of watching yourself lose. Yes yes, you can always concede. The fact they had to include a concession "rule" just highlights this fact even more.

"Non-spatial civ game which is still fun without pvp attacks (Peaceful Variant). I really like it, but we need to get faster, since I can't justify spending 6 hours on it very often."

What I like:
- The civ theme
- Cool mechanisms (sliding cards; resource/worker banks)
- Good variety; interesting decisions; not total brain-burner; very deep
- Has some "restrain the leader" mechanisms
- "Simple" game is a very nice introduction

What I don't like:
- Too long for my tastes
- The "peaceful variant" is good, but feels incomplete
- There are a few pointlessly complex rules (like what cards you can/can't use the turn you draft them)

I'm surprised how much I like this game. First, because it is longer and heavier than I usually enjoy. Second, because I have strongly disliked every other Vlaada game I have tried. This game avoids his bad design traits (pointless complexity, and randomness you can't mitigate). I tried playing online, and it's much harder to see the whole game and notice what you should be working on, and to see the end of each age approaching.

After watching Rahdo's runthrough, I was able to teach the simple game (while reading the rulebook). Our 2p learning game ("Simple") took 2.5 hours, which wasn't bad at all. Next we played 2p "Full", which took 6.5 hours.

From a complexity standpoint, I put it on par with Eclipse or Agricola...about a 3.3. But it seems to be quite a bit deeper than either of those, with more varied strategies, so I could see a net weight of perhaps 3.5 or so. 

EDIT: Downgrading rating from 7 to 4, because the peaceful variant is not that satisfying (especially given the length), and I would never play with the full military rules in place.

Wow. Now this is what I hoped 'Agricola' would be like. Here, you also get a lot of cards, but the play is just so much better. And really, who needs 400 combo cards for a game about 'farming'? Not me. At least this game has some scope. I took a year off off board gaming and this is my first purchase in a long time. I feared the top ten, as I usually don't like any of the games in the top ten BGG list, (hated 'race for the galaxy' and 'twilight struggle') but this was an exception. Every person I played it with so far (3 who also played Agricola) preferred 'through the ages'. Beats the hell out of the Avalon hill version.

We started with a 2 player Simple Game and the feeling was that it flew by too quickly, the game never really started, but we put that down to it not being the full game.

Love the mechanics and there are a lot of things to manage. My first play was at four with three new players, so there was a lot of down time and we had to end it after the second age. Managing workers, buildings, happiness, food and resources (amongst others) which are all integrated and linked in some way, provide for a lot of thought on each turn. Very little interaction with the exception of pacts and wars, but you still have to watch others especially for the strength status and other levels, which can get to be a little much as so much can change from turn to turn. Gets repetitive near the end and there are a lot of cube to manage back and fourth.

Un gioco che ti fa invidiare gli adolescenti, che non devono alzarsi presto per andare a lavorare la mattina dopo. Un Civilization con le carte, cos√¨ aderente al videogioco di Sid Meier da farti quasi gridare al plagio. Through the Ages √® un gioco "importante", solido e purtroppo interminabile. Le meccaniche non sono subito immediate, ma poi entrano in circolo. Ci sono belle idee, come il pool popolazione, che ti penalizza se non impieghi la tua gente in attivit√† pi√π convenienti, o i personaggi storici, o la griglia con i costi delle scoperte/meraviglie del mondo.

I really like this civilization game, it feels a little like the Civilization computer game, and a little like Phoenicia (but without auctions and runaway leaders).  There are a ton of interesting decisions regarding how to allocate your resources and population, and often you're faced with decisions about what direction you need to take your civilization, because you can't do it all.  The aggression cards seems a little bit tough on players that are struggling to afford a military force.  One downside is that the game really takes a long time, and the other players have nothing to do while it's not their turn.  Maybe best as a two-player affair.

Love this game sooooo much. Some of the components are a bit fiddly though [looking at you wooden discs things] and keeping track of all the information flowing at you can get a bit crazy. Fantastic game with 2 and 3 but tends to bog down too much with 4. The cards provide quite a bit of choices, especially the leaders and the wonders. Keeping a balance of Culture, Science and Military is quite the challenge. Getting a few extra civil actions can make quite the difference. Also, get the Upgrade pack for components. Makes a HUGE difference in this actually getting to the table for me. Much less fiddly even though it's basically the same thing.

I have two big complaints about the game. One, is that Military can become problematic and I feel like often, it's the way to win the game. And Two, I don't like how various keywords are interchangeable and not really well defined. For example, lose a population is one I constantly have to look up. Do you physically lose a yellow token, do you destroy a building, do you slide an available worker down to your general population bank? I think words need to be bolded and clarified.

One of the best Civilization Games out there. It trades the map for time, so it can be played up to 4 hours without sacrificing almost any micromanagement; economy, culture, warfare, resource management, it's all there! Offering 3 different playing levels (Simple/Advanced/Full) is really a plus for someone who wants to learn the game. I would probably enjoy different conditions as well, instead of having only the "Time" victory condition, i.e., highest score at a predetermined time, but that's for another game.

Excellent civilization game. Very close to a perfect civilization board game. The only negatives are that I miss playing with a map and being able to explore and maneuver units. As it is, the combat aspect is a little underwhelming to me, but it works, and the rest of the game is fantastic, so I'm quite pleased with it overall. It's difficult to balance everything as there is always more things that you want to do than you can. I really can't fathom the whining about playtime. It's one hour per player if you don't screw around.

January 2011: I rate the simple game as 8. I except that the advanced and full versions are better, but even the simple version gave some challenge and was a good way to learn the basic mechanics without too much player interaction.

January 2011: After one advanced game I think it is very appropriate to rise my rating from 8 to 9. The new mechanics, especially political actions, add to player interaction quite a bit and makes it harder (in a good way) to guide your civilization through the ages.

I like it very much. It is just a bit too long to see frequent time on the table, which really is a shame. The cards of my FRED edition are horrible - they have warped quite much (update: sleeves have helped this situation a lot).

Superb design in the respect that it resembles civilization building very well with a lot of interesting choices.

minuses:

* Suffers from bash the weakest problem. Having bash the leader problem in games is much more fun.
* Solitaire feel - During a regular player turn all you do is fiddle around with disks on your own player board. Yes there are wars, and common card row, but still.. the main thing you do in the game is fiddling around on your player board and it does not affect other players decisions that much of how excactly you fiddle those disks there, so the result - solitaire feel.

12/19/10:  I love this game.  It offers a lot of variety, and it rewards repeat plays because knowledge of the cards/events is helpful.  I think it strikes just the right balance between long-term planning and tactical moves.  I feel that there are definitely different strategies to take to win (or lose).  I've seen strong militaries win handily and some come in last.  A great game.

Brutally efficient and tight, it suffocates people who cant think ahead. Its unfortunately unforgiving but a great enging building game. Sadly, its too much of a tight engine building game for my taste, and its too abstract that I sometines forget I am building a civilization. Did i mention its unforgiving in results and flexibility? The downtime is brutal.

This is probably the finest civilization building game out there. And it's a card game.

I read somewhere that Vlaada spent 100 years or so developing and perfecting this masterpiece and it kind of shows. Everything is extremely clever. I think the resource management in particular is nothing less than brilliant. You really feel the need to develop new technologies and put them to use. Brute force inefficient soviet-like economies are doomed to be defeated and forgotten. Corruption is a bitch. Managing tech, resources, happiness and population while at the same time keeping a strong army to defend your civilization or crush your enemies is not an easy task but it sure is a gratifying one.

I heard some complaints about the military and how it supposedly was overpowered but I whole heartedly disagree. The military is what shakes things and allows the great seeping and gamechanging moves, thus keeping Through the Ages from being a boring economic snowball engine game. 

Maintaining an effective army will harm your ecnomomic growth, but if you don't have one your opponents will make you pay a very high price. Finding the right balance between an adequate army and a powerful economy is key.

Through the Ages does take a long time (around 3h with 2 players, 4h with 3) but every single minute is worth it and time just flies.

Some components are flawed, the quality of the cards could be better but who cares?

Quite a lot of cards...
I've played only the advanced game to the end of II-era. That was 3 hours with rules explanation, so I guess I won't be playing the full game. 

Anyways, there sure is an awful lot of things to do and not enough resources for that. The only thing I disapprove in this game is the military and it's weird and often unrewarding role.
Otherwise, this game is quite masterfully balanced, given the great number of variables. There is always a shortage of something, I guarantee you...

The optimum player number is definitely 3, since then the downtime is just fine and nothing too relevant is removed from game. Well, this is playable enough with 2 players too, but I won't even consider playing with 4.

All in all, quite ok. 

Edit: more plays were needed for me to really appreciate this. The rating rose from 7 to 9. Great game when played with minimal downtime! Full game was played under 3 hours with 3 players. Now that's the lenght I like!

D and I first tried this game soon after we started gaming (borrowing a copy from friends.) We played the simple game and while I liked it quite a bit, it was not clicking with D since he was not a fan of long, complex games. I returned it to our friends and took it off my wish list.

It's a couple years later now and D & I have played many complex, long games now. A trade offer came up so I decided to give it a whirl again. I enjoyed our second play as much as the first and D actually liked the game too. Looking forward to trying the advanced game and glad to have added a civ game to our collection.

Bought at Essen 09. Played the simple game, once we got used to the rules it wasn't all that complicated. Good game, I'm really curious how much better it will get with the advanced and full version... 

Played the simple game twice more, it plays in about an hour and we put the setup tokens in separate bags for each color, so that should make setup a lot quicker next time. 

First advanced game, we played without the aggression cards, and it was a lot more complicated than the simple game, but so much more interesting. 

Bought the cubes at Essen '10.

I really like the Civilisation computer game series. It isn't going to be easy recreating the experience of a solitaire computer game that lasts a month in a multiplayer board game that lasts an evening.
Through the Ages is a very good attempt. I can accept the compromises - no map, a weak tech tree and a very abstract military combat - but I still feel like I've played a civ game. Part of this is that even though this is a victory point game - so a lucky card can make a difference of a few points, which could change the ranking in a close game, but a good score is primarily the result of good play throughout the game and not just luck.
Also, there is very little hidden information - just the political card draw - so I like playing this solitaire: I set up a four player game and play each of the players myself.

Played it once by the short, simple rules; Giving a rating based on that one play would be unfair as the short, simple rules really suck and are just for people who never played a game before where you have to build an engine of creating resources/food. The credo with the short rules are: fuck engine building, take all the points you can get!!

Fantastic. An amazing game. One of the best civ building games, without a doubt. 

What makes it different to a lot of other civ building games is that this is really just a card game (no 'dudes on a map' here), but it's still epic. Also, the rulebook is pretty poorly written. Once you manage to learn it, though -- wow. Great game!

A very very awesome game. Building a VP engine the feels like a civilization. Ok so the theme isn't perfect. Most of the time you are just picking up cards. Some additional artwork would help a lot.

A very good game - but the rules are really rather awful.  They're fine in places, but dreadful in other places.  (I think it's partially down to poor translation, partially down to inadequate proofreading when updating the game for the new release.)

A complex game, with a lot to remember.  Once you've "got it" then it flows well and quite quickly.  Haven't played it many times yet, but it seems well balanced and well thought out.  The components are a bit too small for my taste (big hands...) and the board and card manufacturing quality is poor.

The flaws, unfortunately, turn what could be a great game into merely a good game.

Gloria Mundi, St Petersburg, Agricola etc. dressed up as a civ game without a map but really an efficiency engine like the above.  Sometimes long due to too much downtime.

I was aware of this game for a long time before the re-print.  I wanted to like this game so much.  I love Civilisation boardgame, and I hoped this would appeal in the same way, but with a card game orientation and playable in an evening.  Sadly, it just doesn't work for me.  Too much tedious tiny counter shuffling and hard number crunching analysis.  Feels too much like an accountancy exercise for my liking.

This game is too much like an exercice in accounting with an abacus.

This game is probably too long and repetitive for what it offers (at least to me). Too much micromanagement and not enough interaction for the length. It's much a matter of playing against the game than against other players and luck takes a non negligible part. I don‚Äôt find this game to be very exciting and I‚Äôm not convinced it has a lot of depth. Lot of decisions are no-brainers, few agonizing. Although I can play it from time to time.

PS: This game has been supersesed by Rise of Empires.

I will not play Advanced. Simple is a waste of time. This game is really only balanced for the Full version.

What a fantastic implementation of the Sid Meier's Civ series into cardboard format! You are juggling 17 different balls meanwhile trying to prevent your opponents from getting killer combinations like Michelangelo/Basilica or Napolean/Air Forces. I want to play this game more than anything else at the moment, which is why I have it rated 10. This I'm sure has to do with the fact that it's 4 hours long and very difficult to get to the table as a result. However, for all the downtime/AP whiners out there, I played a 4p Full game of this in 4 hours, 10 minutes (not including setup and takedown) so I know it can be done in a (semi)reasonable time!

This is the ultimate Euro. Build A to get B to use to get C, etc. Interesting but long. I like the game but it can punish a player for missing something small. There are so many A-B-C and X-Y-Z mechanisms in the game that in every game I have played one player has messed up by missing something minor. It can be very difficult to recover i.e. the game is somewhat unforgiving. Great design, very challenging but not as much fun as some simpler Empire building games (Conquest of Paradise for example.)

Game is a ton of fun. Next to Dominant Species, my favorite game. Lots of meaty player choices. Only complaints are the game is longer with more people, and you really can't play with newbies without taking the time to do a simple game first. There are a few bits I don't like (late game, you can have tons of actions but nothing to do with them if you aren't extremely careful with your choices), but overall, I really like the game.

Comparable in complexity to Dominant Species, but a lot more intuitive. The game play weight is 4 instead of 3 because you get stuck with some extremely difficult mutually exclusive decisions later on, plus there are a number of mechanics you need to remember to balance and sometimes do math several turns ahead.

That all said, much as I love the game, I wouldn't really recommend buying it. It's tough to jump into the full game (or the medium game) with newbies, and even among my dedicated gaming group, I have trouble getting people to play this.

We played the advanced, rather than full, game but it still took four hours. In retrospect, it was a mistake to play with four players only one of whom had played before.

A two to three hour experience (with three experienced players) that feels like an hour.
There's a lot of game to explore here.  The order that the cards come out each age will make each game different.  Players are almost always wishing that they had 'one more action.'  The very real decisions about whether to use extra actions to grab that critical card at three actions and not expand that lab or hope it's still there next turn are frequent and enjoyable.

Long, and a brain burner, but the truest civilization experience in a board game.  Very deep.  Every time a I play I find more to discover.

We liked it after our first play. We played through 2 ages. The only caveat is that this is a full day affair and you will likely not get anything else in. But it has a nice flow to the building of your civ. We had an arms race going but no one ever attacked, it will be interesting to try that strategy next time.

My second play was just 2 player and I enjoyed that. We almost got through two ages in about 2.5 hours.

A dozen plays advanced and full game rules - takes a partial game to learn the mechanics. Often worth restarting at that point if you have a mix of veterans and noobs. The rules are different during the first three turns so a careful reading is needed to catch all the details. The game pace moves along suprisingly quickly but it is still a long, enjoyable, game. Reminds me of Sid Meier's Civ (computer game). 

Would benefit from a larger individual player mat that the cards were tucked around so the marker beads did not have to be picked up or slid across card edges.

I'm working out a variant that allows for simultaneious play during the civil actions phase to greatly speed play.

Actually fun to play! I like its younger brother, "Roll Through the Ages" better (since this one competes with heavier games to get to the table).

One thing I don't like in this game is that it takes the "inconsistence of techs from different eras" to a whole new level. This also plagues many other Civ. games like Sid Meyer's Civilization (a feature many find the coolest stuff in a Civ. game ever - I don't).

That being said, this is a fairly solid - and illogical - Civ. game!

Excellent civilization building game.  Between the different wonders, different emphasis through buildings and leaders, the randomness of the technologies and other cards, I feel that each player can customize their civilizations without feeling forced into a particular path or like a carbon copy of someone else's.

It would have been nice to have an actual map exploration mechanic, but we can't get everything in one game.
Also, for all the different things you can do, at the end of the game, all that matters is how much culture you have, rather than having perhaps having different end goals for victory.

This compares will the original Civilization game. It is a good resource management game. 
 
With the indirect scoring mechanism - get culture points - however to do so you need to build your economy to get resources to build buildings to get points... The decision tree is huge.
Having to make the most of your limited action points coupled with resource penalties if you try to accumulate too much drives much of the game angst.
An abstracted military mitigates losing the geographic element of most Civ style games. 
The card drafting mechanism is an excellent replacement for the card element of Cive, and is a addition to provide difficult choices for the players.

I see a lot of re-playability in the game. 

You can have downtime especially later in the game as the number of choice open for each player. While you can preplan your move you have to wait and check the card draft to see how that impacts your move.

Add in events (both good and bad) you have a very rich game.

A massive Civ game with tons of stuff involved!  Love the scaling of the game, but it always feels like 1-2 people get left behind early and have a tough time catching up.  Coming in around 4 hours each time I've played, this is also a time hog, especially if you're one of the aforementioned people.  Overall, I feel that this game is excellent, but seems to be missing some intangibles that could really push this to a "9" or "10" rating for me.  Some of the leaders seem a bit overpowered too, so perhaps some mild modification of their abilities would help make this game more balanced.

When this game came out and I played it I thought I was really going to like it as I loved Sid Meier's Civilization computer game.  However after a few plays I found that it was a bit fiddley and there was way too much time  between turns with nothing tot think about.  I would never play this game again with more than three people.  You can take your turn, go play another game, come back to the table and it is still not your turn.

This one is hard for me to rate. Its a really good, fun 2-3 hour game. The problem is, it takes much longer than that, more like 5-6 hours. Cutting it off after only 2 ages helps, I just wish it could move a bit faster. I did play with 4 players and perhaps 3 would be a big improvement on this.

RATING: 9.5
I've played this numerous times and it just gets better and better. Requires quite a bit of balancing in terms of all your resources and very challenging. I think the only negative qualm I have is its game length which very long, but the time does go by fairly quickly once you get used to the game mechanics. It took me a few games before I got the hang of everything and I think it's a difficult game to teach, but a very rewarding game. I've played both the on-line and real life versions. The on-line version is very forgiving in that it lets you 'test out' different scenarios before committing your actions. I've easily played over 100 games, but I am no longer recording my on-line plays.

This used to be my favorite civilization game until i bought "Nations".  I now prefer Nations as it uses most of the same mechanics in a more streamlined fashion (no moving chits back and forth or keeping cards in your hand that you play later, etc).  This game is more complex and involved and in my opinion takes much longer to play.

My first long 4p game took 6,5 hours but all said it felt like 3h.
The game offers lots of options.
Somehow i felt, that not all decisions mattered. Sometimes i just used my last civil points to "randomly" buy cards.

They told me afterwards, that the rules weren't hard to grasp.

First 2p game: It felt like the last 3/4 hour was too much.
This could get better if we get faster and perhaps learn that sometimes less actions and more VP on the Government is good, too. 

This game is amzing at all numbers, but playing wioth more then 2 adds more military options.

RATING: 7.8
Preliminary rating 7, may improve with further plays; suffers a little from all the details I played wrong on the first play that screwed up the game, otherwise would probably be 8 to 8.5.  Very "meaty" game with a large number of options to consider, few obvious best choices.  I love resource collection and management games with power acquisition (i.e. building something gives you additional abilities), and this game has more of it than just about any game I know.  Decent player interaction with a lot of great game mechanics, though I thought the effect of my sucessful war against another player was FAR out of proportion to the effort required (FIFTY VP swing!), and I might like the game better with all war and agression cards removed (but that would make a lot of the technologies completely useless, and maybe this incident was unusual). Love to try it again when I have a LOT of time to devote to it. (Rating raised to 7.8 after merely thinking about the game; not even needing to play it again.)

At this point this is my #2 game (right behind Innovation mostly due to length). 
I love this game so much. No game is perfect but this one is dang close. Considering its length and depth it has been played a fair number of times and will see many more I am sure. 
Action Point Allowance, mega turns/combos, constant interesting decisions, no dice, and civ building theme. Soooooooooo Good!!!!

RATING: 6
Epic game - and I haven't played the full version yet! I keep making the same mistakes, neglecting science and not building enough mines, as I only play this once every six months or so. But by the end I'm enthusiastic about it and looking forward to playing it again - in another six months time.

It all works very well as a civ building game without mind blowing amounts of book keeping - although by the end of a game the large amounts of bonuses and card effects reminds of of Race to the Galaxy on steroids. Not one for a breezy game with the family.

UPDATE: It is now gathering dust on the shelf and when I see people playing it at Cons I just can't bring myself to play - too resource heavy, which is perhaps my least favourite theme/mechanic. Had to sell it.

After 5 play (advanced game- 3 hours) including   1 play of the full game (5 hours), with 3 players: Wow !This is incredibly good, really. 3 players is probably the perfect number, I would not try the full game with 4.

Very good game. I played Nations first and like it very much but tta is even better. There is only 3 things wrong with it, i played only online through Board Game Arena, there is no way you could get it for a reasonable price in Poland (i think this is due to publishers who don't want to make a competition between Nations and tta, both from one publisher here) and i suck at it for now.

(Updated...years later and over 25 games in): Wow, did this game hold up. Have since moved on to 2nd edition, but both are fantastic. Must own for any civ builder fan.

I don't usually slap a 10 on a game after just one play, but this was board gaming nirvana. The mechanics are much simpler than you would expect once you're familiar with the flow, but the variety of strategic options are astonishing. The downtime was minimal with two players--this might be more of an issue with more, and I can expect the game to add at least 1 hour per player.

This is a rich and complex game, very satisfying for those willing to put in the time to learn and play it. Very "fiddly" in the sense of having a lot of simple arithmetic and bead-push accounting to do, and a lot of rules to keep track of, but well worth the effort! My rating has gone up with more plays, and this has become one of our very favorite games, especially since it is so good for two players.

The first part of the game, age A and I, is the most interesting. After that the end game really hinges on how well of an age A or I that you have had.

The latter age technologies are cool but difficult to employ. So, there effect on the game is minimal.

The strong military and strong science strategy seems to be the only way to win, since there really is not much else that is produced except culture.

The resource and food production need to be optimized or the player will be set back probably fatally set back.

Once you are behind there is no way to catch up against a competent opponent.

The events and conflicts reward players who are already ahead and do give the trailing players a second chance.

In all too much optimization is required. I always felt that I was threading the needle rather than building and advancing a civilization.

I was interested in this until I saw the ridiculous price and heard about the awful components in the American edition. Finally bought the much cheaper German version in 2009.

As it turns out, the hype seems deserved: although quite complex, this is a fun game to play. Agonizing choices to be made each turn as you try to build up (and defend) your civ: a very good game.

Not a fan of the (German) rules: lots of important information that should be placed close together is actually spread over the 3 rule sets. Also, the base game is not for play, just to teach you a few of the basics. Better to go straight to the advanced or (in my case) the full game.

Solved the rules issues by (as I usually do) summarizing the entire game down to 2 illustrated A4 pages.

Initial rating of 8 upgraded to 9 after second play.

...And back down to 7. I'm deducting 2 points due to its ridiculous length, meaning it won't get to the table a lot, if at all anymore. There are now other games that have taken its place (Nations, Clash of cultures). Perhaps the new version planned by CGE will remedy this, but we will see.

RATING: 4
Just as I'd feared, this is simply the boring parts of the Civ PC game - the parts I automate - turned into a long, fiddly board game.

There's no real thematic heft, no narrative, and little interaction. This is a spreadsheet euro through and through. Le Havre does the mini-maxing engine thing without all the fiddly barrel shuffling and in 1/4th the time.

It's baffling that a pure euro which doesn't meet basic standards in elegance and balance should earn such acclaim. Who knew there was such a market for the clunky bits of a PC game ported into a clumsily produced board game.

I though it was great, I thought it was broken, and now I think there's a lot more skill in this game then you'd think.

As a civilisation building game, it certainly has some complexity which I like.  It feels more like an empire building game than multiple city building game.  Additionally the lack of a map as a concept was deterring me from getting this game but the reviews on gamegeek changed my mind.  Not sure how often this would get played with my gaming friends as we sometimes differ in our opinion of fun.
Time will tell...giving this game a rating of 7 after 1 play on advanced. 
After many plays, i really like this game but it seems to favour a warfare strategy a little too much.

An excellent and enjoyable game.

One of the best games in existence.

The only weak areas in its design are
the following:

1 I would have preferred a map as part
of the game to give it a more strategic feel.
2 There is no catch up mechanism in
the game. If one falls behind militarily
one becomes a safe target and tends
to fall even further behind.
3 There is not enough interaction in
the game such as perhaps bidding
for cards instead of simply buying
them.

All in all , however, this is an excellent
game, much more deserving to be rated 
number one than: Twilight Struggle.

My physical copy of TtA goes unplayed most of the time, unfortunately - my wife really disliked the game (which I didn't expect; admittedly at the time I didn't realise how important the military aspect of the game would turn out to be, but her main objections are about the whole game system), and while no-one else I've played it with has had such a bad reaction, no-one has been interested enough to want to regularly spend 4-5 hours playing this game. It gets an occasional Sunday outing (we have "all-day" games days once a month on a Sunday). But thankfully, I get to play almost all the time on BGO (although now I play the new version), so I can, I think, give some considered views on this game.

This is, with no exaggeration, simply one of the best games ever designed. Civilisations rapidly begin to diverge based on the cards they pick up - and there is great tension in trying to keep up adequate levels of production in food, resources, and science, as well as gain enough actions to have effective turns, while not falling too far behind in production of the all-important culture (that is, VPs), and most of all not falling behind militarily. Because this game, while not allowing an easy way to win by military means alone (except in 2-player, my least favourite form of the game), will see you being absolutely crushed if you can't keep you army at least roughly as strong as other players'. This is what puts many players off the game, but is at the heart of much of the tension which makes it so great.

There are other fantastic features too - my personal favourite is probably the seeding of events. Like many games, events are turned up randomly at intervals and can potentially affect all players - but in this game, each player chooses some of the events which will happen, and has some control also over when they happen, leading to many strategic and tactical choices. Vlaada Chvatil is one of my favourite designers, and his designs cover an enormous variety of different types of game - but TtA is still, in my opinion, his greatest game.

Of course, this is about to be superseded by the new version, with some significant rules changes, major changes to some cards, and some superb-looking art (which just shows up the poor quality of the art and components in the Eagle edition of the original game even more). Since I so rarely get to play TtA physically, I have resigned myself to the fact that it would be a waste of money to buy it, but I am very sad about this. At least get to play the new version on BGO (and it is, indeed, even better than the original).

(12/08/2008) - This arrived today as part of another order from CoolStuffInc. I've been wanting this game for months and months, but the unacceptable quality of the inaugural FRED edition prevented me from buying it. FRED has finally released a new edition and I scooped the game up as soon as I could.

(1/4/2008) - [9] - 5 plays down and I am hooked. After all the wait and hype I built in my mind, this game still exceeded my expectations. The careful balance of corruption/consumption/happiness, the fight for cards, the danger of attacks, all of it blends so perfectly. I imagine when I finally play a Full Game (instead of Simple or Advanced) this will become a 10.

It's clear to me that there are many false choices in the game; there appear to be many options when, in fact, there are few.  Get your science up and focus on military.  It's that simple.  It's fun to explore the different paths, but after a few hundred plays, it comes down to 'get your military up and plan for war with the leader.'  As a result, luck of the draw is worse than it initially may appear. 

It scales well though the 2-player (2 - 2.5 hrs) is very different than 4-player (4+ hrs).

Joguei apenas a vers√£o avan√ßada, n√£o ainda a Full. E n√£o sei se vou jog√°-la.

O jogo √© curt√≠ssimo de recursos. No TTA light, felicidade e ex√©rcitos n√£o eram problema. Fica f√°cil fazer engines de comida e de produ√ß√£o gigantescos, para bombar a civiliza√ß√£o de cultura e ci√™ncia e construir wonders adoidado. Nessa vers√£o o buraco √© bem mais embaixo. Se voc√™ n√£o alegrar sua popula√ß√£o enquanto cresce, sua civ entra em guerra civil. E se n√£o acompanhar o crescimento militar dos outros, toma porrada turno sim e o outro tamb√©m. Consequentemente, tudo fica muito apertado. Num jogo de 4h30, nossas civs n√£o avan√ßaram tanto.
Isso para mim √© um problema. N√£o curti passar 4h30 sofrendo quase sem conseguir evoluir. Claro que com o tempo o seu desempenho melhora. Mas o jogo full vai durar mais 2h. Ser√° que vale se martirizar 6h em pelo menos mais umas 3 partidas pra conseguir jogar direito? N√£o acho.

Independente disso, tem que elogiar o sistema que o Vlaada criou pro jogo. Complexo mas totalmente intuitivo, e muito bem calculado pra continuar deixando o jogo apertado n√£o importa em que era voc√™ esteja.

Voltando aos problemas: me pareceu que j√° na primeira metade do jogo, √© poss√≠vel ficar fora da disputa pela vit√≥ria (tanto que existe um mecanismo de desist√™ncia, em que o jogador abandona o jogo no meio). Achei que fosse acontecer comigo, mas todo mundo fez besteiras em sequ√™ncia e eu consegui me reerguer, por isso o jogo acabou razoavelmente equilibrado. Mas se num jogo de 6h, se algu√©m n√£o tiver sua engine funcionando razoavelmente na primeira metade, est√° fora da briga. Pior que isso, n√£o vai poder nem jogar seu joguinho solo tentando perder com honra, porque sua engine n√£o vai conseguir suportar um bom poderio militar, ou seja, voc√™ vai tomar rasteira da galera o tempo todo.

A parte militar foi outra coisa que n√£o curti muito. As rasteiras s√£o razoavelmente frequentes e podem ser bem pesadas. Entra num n√≠vel de fura√ß√£o de olho que eu n√£o curto. O seu advers√°rio pode roubar cartas, destruir pr√©dios, roubar recursos, e isso √© muito frustrante. N√£o sei ainda exatamente por que, mas as rasteiras do El Grande, do Dominant Species e do Agr√≠cola, por exemplo, me frustram bem menos do que as agress√µes do TTA e de jogos de combate como Eclipse e wargames em geral.

Outro problema do jogo √© o downtime. Como os jogadores fazem todas as suas a√ß√µes na sua vez, acontece √†s vezes de vc ficar 20 minutos s√≥ esperando sua hora de jogar. E conforme o jogo avan√ßa e voc√™ ganha mais op√ß√µes e mais a√ß√µes, s√≥ piora.

Resumindo: admiro o TTA, definitivamente n√£o √© um jogo qualquer. Mas n√£o √© pra mim.

(+) Nice engine building aspects. Feeling of growth and accomplishment -> a very big plus!
(+) Original mechanism with 'future' events
(+) Most will say the cards are ugly, but I kind of like them :)
(+) Different options: simplified game, advanced game, full game
(+) Some mechanics of this game inspired a whole lot younger boardgames later on. Through the Ages can be considered as the father of many other nice games.
(+) Real differentiation and stories emerge while playing. Many different ways to play the game.

(-) Kind of fidly: lots of small bits and tokens, some fidly rules you have to remember and a maybe not so elegant mechanism which dictates to take actions with small white disks
(-) Quite some downtime as you have to wait for opponents to finish their entire game turn

Note: Military might will probably not win you the game, but if your strength does not keep up with the competition, many events, agression cards and wars might crush you. This is not a military game, unless one or more players neglect their military power. It is really important to make this clear to new players.

Approx gametime advanced game: +- 45 - 50 min / player

One 4p and one 3p play, but how promising. The advertised time frame (180min) seems a little on the short side, although the 3p (full) game comes close. Definitely a recommendation with 3 players...

UPDATE: Played several times more now, and this leads me to think that the 4p game might have a little to much downtime. Perhaps 3p is the sweet spot for this game.

1st play: an impressive game. The high ratings are deserved. I enjoyed the mechanics and the challenge of balancing military strength, ideas and resources (human and material). Theres a lot going on but it eventually makes sense. My concern is the length. Our first play took a good 4 hours. I know this will limit how often I can fit this into a limited game schedule.

My rating is for playing this online, when the computer handles all the fiddliness, and you do your turn whenever it comes up so the length of the game doesn't really matter. Playing this live, I'd probably rate this slightly lower. That doesn't take away the fact that this is a really, really good game though. I really like the way all the systems are entwined with each other. At first it was hard to see the exact value of things, but you quickly learn not to neglect any parts of your government.

Even online, this game isn't quite a 10, though. Turns are extremely tactical, and I enjoy trying to make due with what is available to you while keeping an eye on the future. However, due to the luck of the draw you can get thoroughly stuck if what you desperately need simply isn't available in any of your turns. You can't really afford to ignore any of the resources, but sometimes the game will deny them from you just by the luck of the draw. I've had games where I simply couldn't upgrade my food, some where I couldn't upgrade my science, some where I couldn't upgrade my resources, and others where trying to upgrade military is a chore. If you don't have those upgrades available on your turns for a large chunk of the game, it's not going to go well for you.

Another thing I'm not a huge fan of is the way the game encourages players to beat on the player with the weakest military, and not the player with the most culture (points). This often leaves someone who is already not doing well getting hammered over and over. Not a very enjoyable experience.

Initial play of the simple game with 4 newbies to learn the overall game flow mechanics and finish in a reasonable amount of time was very interesting.  Plenty of decisions to be made each turn for a very satisfying game.  But we do recognize that it was an abbreviated game and wonder how much our efforts might have survived (or changed) had we played deeper into the ages.  Looking forward to trying again.

   OK, four plays with a range from 2 to 4 players. This is a downtime feast. For the two players version, that could be tolerated, but I just cannot conceive a civ-like themed game with only two civs, thats of course a personal taste.

   For a game as long as it is (ours last game took 4 hours for 3 players), players can get fast behind the curve by making a mistake (or just a newbie player to the game), and stand possibly 2+ hours knowing you just cant win and falling behind more and more, is no fun. And worse, most game events just punish the players who are already doing poorly. One can argue, that if a player makes mistakes, should be punished, but well, I play games for fun, and being or seeing a spectator for a long time doesn't fit my concept of fun.

   For a such long game, the card drawing randomness kills any long term strategy planning. You are just playing the cards that are available when your turn comes up, because next one these will be entirely different. That's usually not a problem for me with much shorter games, but with this game I find myself for the last part of the game doing exactly the same as before, again and again, without really seeing the gameplay evolving, other than seeing the numbers in the cards growing up.

   The military aspect of the game, simply doesn't work, not even thematically. There is no real risk in aggressions, and that makes it a no choice to attack the players that militarily gets behind (many times just because of luck in early stages), and he will lose even if he fends off the aggression, because he will be forced to sacrifice one or more units (that cost resources of course). So when one player attacks another, the only question is if the attacker will get some benefit from it or not. Wars are somewhat different (the aggressor takes some risk), the defender can prepare, but in practice it doesn't change nothing, because no one will attack if there is a chance to lose. In a four players game, if someone gets only a bit behind in military power, he can easily get crunched and pushed out of the game. I think this problem arises fundamentally from the fact that there is very little hidden info involved in aggression, only defend/colonization cards, so it gets clear who can beat whom. It feels rather strange to me that in a game where the card distribution and timing along the slider, gives the game so much randomness and unpredictability, the only real interaction between players is so predictable.

   The final score events, makes things worse because as most events, will only help the stronger civs, so those just pull a player ahead when he is already ahead (I'm not talking here about a leading player getting more benefit from the events than the rest of the players, but cards being completely useless if the player who draws them it not ahead, and playing event cards scores points so... you can imagine the rest). There is a horrible random factor there, in the timing of the game, because if you get them early in the age you can prepare and exploit them, but in the last turns of the game its pure luck to draw a card that will bonus yourself (or one that would have benefited another one had he drawn it). Some cards can make a huge difference between two given players (easily >12-14 VPs), so depending on who draws them, the score varies greatly, just of pure luck. In all my games the winner was exclusively determined because of who draw what third age events (and some broken Wonders). You can improve your position to draw more cards, but in the last age all players who still can win, will draw the maximum. I faithfully recommend to explain the third age scoring event cards to newbies before the start, to give them a chance.

   And last, if you take apart wars/aggressions (and those mostly will happen only against the weakest who can't win) and relatively the last age score events, this is a heavy "solitaire-multiplayer" game for most of its length. There is about near zero interaction between players, I know many players like those types of games, so that's a matter of taste. Also, if you are going to try the game, it's no complex at all. This is an economic building eurogame with a twist, and while there is some heavy micromanagement, a few awkward exceptions and a really bad and unnecessarily long rulebook, the gameplay is mostly straight.

Played once, 3 player game, all new to it. The game doesn't have a map, but, uou get the feeling of growing a Civilization, it has a lot of details and a experienced player was supervising our play, without him would have been harder. It's a great game, no doubt about it. With more plays, my rating will go up, I'm sure of that.

I like the concept, but...

Significant downtime, and it is the kind of downtime that does not lend itself to planning out your turn.

I feel like it takes to long for what it is.

A computer version of this would be better as it would take care of the accounting for you.

If you lose a battle early on you will sit out the next 3+ hours while the rest of the players pick your carcass and I say this as one of the 'pickers' and not the 'carcass' but certainly not fun for the carcass. In short there are few if any catch up mechanisms.  This is probably good for some game groups but I just feel sorry for the person that sits there for 3 or 4 hours with no hope of winning. I have won 3 of the 4 games of this I have played and I must admit if I didn't play it again I wouldn't be sad.

There are at least 100 other games I would rather play..

Traded.

I am a sucker for civ games, and this is one of the best.  Our trio of experienced gamers jumped right into the full game, taught by one who had played before.  Deep and immersive, it was difficult to keep our eyes on the culture (victory) points because we were having so much fun just building up our civilizations.  Military strength plays a larger role than I was led to believe; if you don't have a strong military, you will be hosed not only by other players but by the game itself.  Everyone (even onlookers) wants to play it again.

Everything good from Civ games, without the boring parts and dicerolling. Excellent! 

Edit: After more than 10 games, I still want to play again as much as after the first game. The variation between games is immense, even if you play every game with the same strategy they will all be different in big and important ways. Every turn is a small step where you have to prioritize. Most of the time you would like to take every single option there is very much. You are always in charge, but the game gives you different choices every time. Simply superb. 

Edit again: Played 45-50 times now. All previous comments stand, best game I ever played.

Edit 2012: After 80-100 games it started to be less interesting to me.

Loved it!  What a great game!  The only problem is how fiddly it is with all of the tiny markers on tiny tracks, and remembering to adjust your resources and account for corruption every round.  Because of this, we ended up playing the majority of our games online, which was still a great experience.  We don't really like the wars with 2 players, but not doing wars takes very little away from this game.  We ended up buying the new version of this game because we love it so much, and it sounds like that version improved the corruption tracking and wars, so we are very excited about it.  We traded this game away for War of the Ring (Second Edition) after we bought the new edition of TtA.

RATING: 5
Definitely a play before you buy.  I had planned to get this based on the high BGG rank, but after getting a chance to play it, it fell completely flat for us and quickly removed from my wishlist. Very fiddly, constantly moving around little discs, I kept feeling this would be better as a computer game - the tactile aspect of holding small cards and moving small discs adds nothing to the game.  And it doesn't have the great theme of other well-ranked fiddly games that I don't like much (Arkham Horror, BSG).  There is more theme than 7 Wonders, but you definitely don't get the feeling of building a civilization like you do in the Civ computer game. I also don't like the solitaire aspect of resource production inherent in the game - i.e. your resources available next turn are almost completely dependent on how much you decide to not spend this turn and whether you invest in more resource production now - this puzzle-like math calculation is just boring, and is very different from the resource management calculations for games like Agricola where you are grabbing resources produced by a common pool and trying to determine if the other players are going to grab what you want.
2nd play with Advanced Game: no change in my rating - I would call it an interesting game, but not a fun one to physically play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Rating based on the four-player advanced game. I didn't particularly like how the military side worked but that may change if playing with the Wars offered by the full game. It was probably a mistake to play it with more than three the first time. I also missed viewing the ebb and flow of rising and declining civs and that is my biggest gripe. I don't see that this element would ever satisfactorily show itself.

Maybe I'll get a chance to play with three and the rating will go up a little.

Update: Rating lifted to 8. Played the full game with 4 online and it worked much better with the Wars. I still would like to play with 3 face-to-face.

Update: 02/16/16 - Rating this a 9 now. After playing some more and playing other games over the years that are trying to do similar things I see the brilliance of this design. I see the ebb and flow now in the seeding of the future events, the construction of wonders, and the advance of technology. I used to try to find this feeling with the leaders which are attached to multiple time periods within the same age and while I still think it feels weird this was not the portion of the game to which the designer was pinning that feel of the flow of history. It doesn't bother me as much anymore as I'd rather have real historical figures rather than nameless archetypes.

Only a couple of online plays, but so far I am really liking this. The variety seems good, and I can tell there are some different paths to victory. I have ordered a physical copy so I can teach this to my group.

I have now played a 2 player and a 4 player advanced game in person. I wasn't a huge fan of the 4 player game, the down time was a bit much. I think it would probably be okay with 4 experienced players, but where I was teaching three newbies it was a bit much. The 2 player was excellent, and is probably the way I will play this in person. Leaving 4 player games to online, or at minimum experienced players.

Aside from the length, I think this may be the most captivating Civ game I've played.  There is a steep learning curve that most players will overcome after a single play.  I love games where you have to agonize of actions and this one adds tight resource management woes as well.  Military, Culture, or tech, take your pick, there seem to be several strategies for each.  It's games like this (because of length) that make me wish there was a comprehensive online venue (similar to online poker rooms) where waiting for your turn wasn't so agonizing. 
Minor quams:  The round resource disks are a bit of a pain, and some of the graphics are not very intutive.
Over all, great game!

This has got everything I enjoy in a good engine building euro. The first few turns feel like a uphill battle as you get your engine running. Every turn, you have more choices than you know what to do with, which forces you to make some painful ones. You never quite feel like you have enough of anything that you need. The game ends just as soon as you feel like you were making headway. Great game all around, hampered only slightly by the randomness of the available cards.

CONS:
Long (2-3h for a simple game, 4-5h for a advanced game and 6-7h for a full game)
Lots of downtime (you really can't do anything when it's not your turn, made worse by events that happen at the beginning of your turn, most of the time making all your planning obsolete.)
Too little player interaction
Brutal and merciless if you fall behind, comeback is very difficult (not a good thing in a game this long)

Wow, just wow. Amazing civilization building game, fantastic theme, and everything is extremely well designed.

Wow.  A lot going on here!  Really enjoyable Civ game...Played through the Advanced scenario--would still like to try the Full Game.  I wish the artwork and pieces were a bit higher-end but, then again, I quiver at the thought of miniature theatres, farms, etc.  How cool would that be, though?  I did have some conceptual problems with citizens becoming or representing buildings, but that is not the fault of the game so much as how spoiled we have all become by games with such great bits and amazing artwork.  Definitely a must have for any history fan and/or civ fan.  I am neither, but this is now a "must have" for me as well--because, on its own, it's just a fantastic game.

A very deep, intriguing game with a lot to think about that captures the most interesting aspects of Sid Meier's computer game. My biggest fear is that it will be very difficult to catch up with a player in the lead, especially in a two-player game. There are also a lot of aspects of the game that are a bit of a chore (moving the little counters around, repleneshing the cards etc.), but the new edition's components improve this. I can also imagine the game could be frustrating at times.

This is a great civilization game.  Not sure I understand the nuances yet, which is why I like it.  However, it sees a lot less play since Sid Meier's Civilization came out.  The abstracted nature of this one doesn't stand up to SM:C as well.

RATING: 10
There is a distinct pleasure and sense of accomplishment fostered by this game, as every turn sees your civilization facing numerous potential paths into the future, and every civilization quickly becomes unique. At the same time, these possibilities are limited by the increasingly fragile infrastructure of goods and population that each player must manage. The game really becomes an exercise in reaction - that is, constantly refining and adjusting your strategy as the myriad of available options begin to disappear, or when your opponents' actions force you to reevaluate your civilization.

moderately accessible Complex Euro 

THe king is dead! As stated in the above item...but still damn fun to play. I'll be looking into the new version, but I have the common reservations around the gutting of combat options, which are one of my favorite things about the game...I don't own Civ Meyer's Civilization or Nations, for a reason!

Love the complexity, and all of those little circles of wood, feels like a full functioning machine when you get your civ going. My pref is for 2 or 3 players. 3 is great, but sure to honor the 'drop-out' rules, they are there for a reason, to add real threat to hitting someone too hard.

Only payed the basic game.  Need to try the advanced.

Played the full game and it was great, loved the buildup and the management.

Trying it for vassal for the first time, it is a little daunting, having to remember all the rules on my own.

10/29/2010: lower rating half a point, it is still a very good game but it is brutal to the person in last in military, think I need a house rule.

5/14/2011: Lower ratings another 1/2 point.  It is a very good game and I have played it a bunch online but the way combat ends up devastating the weakest player is a minus.

RATING: 2
Once my silly brain figured out what I was doing, mostly, it occurred to me there wasn't much interaction, that the civs took a long time to have any definable style or shape, and that the game would be much more appealing ending sometime around the Renaissance, making the ages more deep and distinct. 

Say, I: Early Ancient, II: Mid-Late Ancient, III: Medieval, IV: Renaissance.

It's also pretty darn boring. 

I admire people trying to simulate the richness of history, but sadly it usually just turns into formulas and very selective looks at the world. The elegance of Civilization is a far, far better guiding light than this.

Excellent design. Almost everything makes sense. It is a very tight resource management game. The military mechanics are great: army is expensive, but you have to compete with the other players, or else you will be constantly crushed. The problem is that I don't feel much enjoyment playing this game (the same feeling I have when I play Chess, another great game). Also, the game is fiddly as hell, the components and artwork are ugly and the price is ridiculous.

Very clever, but found it totally boring. Just pushing round little cubes on some cards. Realised I was paying hardly any attention to what my opponents were doing, and cared little more about my own "civilisation". Found the "alternative history" of the game a complete negative to getting in to the game. I had Winston Churchill in charge of the Pyramids, using alchemy to work out how to invent aircraft.
Found absolutely nothing fun in this game. Didn't enjoy a single decision I had to make. For this kind of brainwork I'd rather do a Kakuro.

Still...very clever mechanics.

RATING: 7
A very good, heavy game with more theme than you would expect. Difficult, requires not only several plays (each lasting several hours) to get going and learn the musts and must-nots, but also regular playing to keep competitive. If you look for a serious, deep game for a fixed group, which you can explore together, and which will not get stale after a dozen plays, look no further. Don't play it with four (unless everybody is very experienced and quick), as downtime will kill you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Sublime, intense, utterly immersing. Best with two or three, beat-downs can become unremitting and painful - going for a non-military strategy is a bold step, that must only be taken if you are prepared to be punished for it. It took me 6 years between first playing this game (and being absolutely blown away by it) and actually getting my own copy - the arrival of a new edition making this classic finally obtainable to incurable skinflints like myself.

RATING: 4
Aargh, a game lasts a whole afternoon. And sll the time you move too many and too small cubes on your board, and in the end a lot depends on the right card draw.
 And the downtime is impressive: I only had 2-player-games and you can easily go to the restroom and when you¬¥re back, it¬¥s still not your turn: it is a kind of workerplacement-mechanic, but you have to place all your workers in every turn.

RATING: 10
Very fiddly, but nice if you've got the time. The rules are straight forward enough - thank goodness for some of the examples to straighten some of the wording out. There are an excellent number of choices where you can choose your path, but at the same time keep up with the other players and be ready for certain events. I really like the combat mechanism for its simplicity and clever functionality. Combat/colonisation weakening the attacker and burning up their resources to rebuild encourages players to pick and choose the conflicts they can afford to lose and those they can't.

Speeds up considerably with further play. Downtime is more a problem with the players and their familiarity with the rules than with the game system. Not recommended with more than three players unless all the players are very familiar with the rules, then it can move along at a nice clip with downtime not an issue. Plan your turn, move your pieces and don't fuss about and take back pieces and try other alternatives. What's done is done - move on, next turn. If you know the rules and can't get the Advanced Game out of the way in under three hours then you're savouring the moment too much and playing too slowly. The Full Game requires only a little more time, but it rewards you with a third age that you enter with your civilisation engine already in full swing. The third age tends to go by quickly as players should have a lot of actions by then to really move through the deck.

With the changing nature of each game (boy, there are a lot of cards!), I'll want to play this a lot more than I have the time to. After a few games I've bumped this up in the ratings. One of those games that gets better and better with further plays. That said, unfortunately in a four player game player elimination is a strong possibility. Opponents don't usually gang up on the leader so much as the weak player. Three hits in a round and you can find you've burnt up you defensive cards and your spare troops. Another three hits the next round and you might as well call it a day. Usually it's not until the third age, so at least an eliminated player doesn't have to wait around too long as the third age flies by quick. If you play with the lower aggression variant (where a player can only be hit once in a round), then it solves this little issue and makes it socially acceptable again with four players. Screw that though - with experienced players, if you're in that position you probably weren't careful enough or paying attention.

My main criticism with the game is not a criticism of the game so much as a criticism of how losing players use wars as a hail mary when all is lost. It's a king making problem. Let's say you have a three player game and player A is way behind in points. So Player A declares war on player B and sacrifice all his/her military units with a turn to go. Invariably in a close game amongst the other players Player B must respond in kind and sacrifice all his/her units. Player A makes maybe a couple of points, if any. Player C reaps the rewards and crushes the weakened Player B. All player A has done is effectively handed the game to Player C, and it could have so easily been Player C that Player A decided to go all kamikaze on. So, is the game at fault for allowing such activity. Not really, but on the other hand it would have been simple for the game to have a rule to reduce the frequency of such moves. Maybe at least saying a player must have a higher military strength at the time he/she declares a war against an opponent. Personally I don't let it worry me, but on the other hand I've been on the winning end of such a scenario. Even without attacking one of the weakened players the Impact cards can hand you a rather hollow victory.

RATING: 4
Heavy Euro of resource and card management that is probably too long and too fiddly for what it delivers at the end, and with a lot of downtime between turns.  Besides, it feels way too abstract for a civilization game, so another setting could have been a better choice for its background.  The lack of a map is another minus in its record.  I like it less with every play.

If I've got the time and the players, this is my pick. She's a brutal civ engine-builder of fun opportunities where you truly choose and then dramatically alter strategies.  The present conditions are key and dictate all the needed info but the goals are king, and ultimately the same.  The only luck is in the opportunities, but limiting yours will very well cost the opposition.No one should predict anything about the future other than 'Obsolescence happens'.  Event card mech is a blast and a half.  I'm excited that there is enough of us to really enjoy 'Full' games now with 3 and I don't ever see being board with the cards... ever.

The rating system here needs to be rewritten. An 8 is "I'll probably suggest it and never turn down a game." This game is clearly better than an 8 but it takes SO LONG TO PLAY I am quite likely to refuse it unless I have the stamina and lots of free time. This is an excellent civilization game. The only thing that's lacking, at least in a "traditional civ game" sense, is an area-control map with which to play pieces. You won't miss it. Instead, the game abstracts territory and combat, focusing all its energy on empire management, invention and utilization of workers. It's bloody marvelous. Time flies while you play this. And then it's nine hours later and it's dark out and your significant other at home is pissed.

In all fairness it shouldn't take nine hours, but we had three players who'd never played before.

Such a great game for me. I love seeing my civilization grow. Some people find the resource management fiddly but I just love all the difficult choices this provides like: "I would love to build this wonder, but do I have the manpower to build it in reasonable time?!". I also enjoy how your military is important, but not overwhelmingly powerful.  This game is just a winner for me.

[based on one Simple game]
After hearing about this game through The Usual Suspects in NYC, I was leery about all the fussiness.  I have to say I was a pleasantly surprised.  Sure, it's a pain in the patootie to move those miniscule little wood shavings around, and some of the interface comes off a bit clunky.  I have to admit that nearly everything else about the game seems well-considered, thematically sound, and not as optimized and "on-rails" as I thought it might be.  It "sticks to my ribs", and I found myself thinking about the game for a few hours after we had moved on.  The only thing keeping me from picking it up right away is the expense, though there is always the Chitkicker discount...

For me, this is without a doubt the best board-game ever devised.

I've played it on the excellent BGO site many times. It's a marvelous design - not so much a simulation of the development of civilization but more like an impressionist painting of the same. Balance amongst the various aspects of development is stressed, you need to expand your food production to grow your population, you need to keep them happy, you need to improve your output of resources in order to build stuff, and you need to improve your science output to advance up the tech tree. Above all, if you neglect the military your efforts elsewhere can be crushed by an aggressor. So many ways to win - so many choices to make each turn. 

I can't recommend this too highly although the time commitment means it will be played online far more often than face to face.

Wow, so many different mechanisms are well-implemented and integrated into the game. I see traces of Saint Petersburg, In the Year of the Dragon, and a very punishing economic system. I love how the cards really further the theme. Conveys the sense that you're doing something epic despite there being no board. My rating will probably go up eventually, but I'm not ready to love this game yet, because the game language and upkeep is so complex, that I can only worry about myself, and hence can't spare any brain cells for player interaction, so it's felt pretty solitaire to me, which is a big no-no. I'm sure this will go up, once I can crunch through the decisions more efficiently and stop screwing up. The Future-Current Events system is very cool, and the 2-worker penalty at the end of an Age is such a subtle mechanism, both in terms of theme and in terms of how it seems so harmless, before you realize, upon encountering it, that it's probably the worst possible thing that happens at the end of an Age.

I've played once, though we didn't make it all the way through, but I can't wait to play again. This game looks to have a lot of replayability since every game is so very different. With a few more plays this score may go up.

With a few more plays under my belt, I have to give this one a solid 10. My only problem now is finding enough people interested in a 4 to 5 hour game to play it anywhere near as much as I'm jonesin' to.

Having played this game with 2,3,and 4 players a number of times, I've decided this is the best game I've ever played. There are more paths to victory and more sublteties in this one than I've seen in any other game.

Now that I've played this nearly ten times, I can honestly say that even though I appreciate what's going on, I think that I'd prefer to play Nations over this.  It's a good game, but I'm not a fan of games where one mistake utterly dooms you to defeat, especially when that game can make you sit through that defeat for 3+ hours.  I'd say that this game is very much like Le Havre in that way.

Once I read the description of this game, I really had no doubts that it would be a game that I would enjoy.  Unfortunately, I'm really not that good at it.  Though I like it, I likely won't ever get to play it enough so that I do become go.  No problem, though.

I have to state that the Basic and Advanced game really serve no purpose other than getting you up to speed to play the full game.  In the first, the game ends just when things start to get interesting.  The second is not so bad, but is clearly truncated--and feels that way.

Still, building up your civ is loads of fun.  Just like in the computer game, I tend to play with blinders, which is fun while you are doing it, but hinders you in the long run.  Despite recognizing this flaw in my play, I am unable to adapt appropriately.  Oh well.  [01/18/2008]

[1 play] I'm giving this a 7, because it doesn't deserve a 6, but I will be cautious to give up an enormous chunk of gaming time to it again until I can spend those gaming time increments more freely than right now.

That said, there are definitely interesting decisions in this game once you can get your head wrapped around how they are implemented.

I may give this a try again on Vassal, where the bookkeeping is done more easily and time is no constraint.

Most recent play 12-20-08 with Brian R, Michael, and Garrett.

Great civilization game that has a few different ways to play depending on if you want a shorter or more involved game. I haven't played many civilization games as most are too long for most tastes, but I found this one interesting while not overstaying its welcome. That's with two players though. I don't know if I'd want to play with more than that. I haven't played in a while as I'd need to read up on the rules again, and that's still a bit daunting of a prospect. I recognize it for the amazing bit of game design that it is though. I know it's available to play online as well, so I should give that a shot sometime!

Sold original edition (I was made an offer I couldn't refuse) and picked up FRED reprint.

Fun, if fiddly (and long) card game. Essentially a cube/resource management Euro. You buy cards and use action points to either buy more cards, develop farms, mine, build wonders, upgrade your army etc.

You churn through three ages of events, characters, buildings etc and at the end, the player with the most culture points (VPs) wins. The cards are fun and full of flavour and there's alot to think about. However, the downtime with a full complement of players is fairly long.

Probably better as a two-player game (though you lose the fun of agression/wars against other players).

 Complex civ cardgame without a map.
 While I can understand why so many people like it, it left me untouched and indifferent. I would play again, but only if my gaming partner strongly insisted. For sure it would not be my first gaming choice(not even second, unless the other option would be crappy). Otherwise, I would pass without any feel that I would miss something special.

I love civilization building games and this is one of the best. At first I thought the cards were unbalanced, but there are plenty of ways to win. In fact, the huge variety of options and strategies leads to great replay value and an intense gaming experience. I also like the little thematic details, like religous improvements providing more happy faces, but no more culture. The only downside of this game is that it can drag a bit when you are losing with no chance of recovery. I like to play two-player with my wife. Neither of us takes long to move and we can start over as soon as it's clear one of us will probably win.

I like the Arena game by the same designer very much. Quality is ok. All components needed to play are in the ( maybe too big ) box. If you do not like the original game, the designer gives you six possibilities to change it slightly to your taste. ( like less war; easier beginning). Do you want to have Sid M. as leader of your civ? Get the game! :-)

It is basically Sid Mayer Civilization - the board game. It has no map, but instead it has terrific tech tree simulation, production, politics, war - and all this is done with cards.

All time fav.  Played once face to face and then immediately jumped into league games that were running at the time on Boardgaming-online.com.  Was a great way to learn by jumping right in and was instantly hooked.  The game has so much going on that even very late into my plays there was still things to learn and improve on.  

Love so much of this game, the card drafting from the card row and figuring out when things should be paid for extra civil actions.  When generally weaker leaders/cards can be used.  Especially like the political card play and tension of being in the lead of military to no suffer from events and knowing when it is more safe to play events when you aren't in the lead.  

Biggest issue in the game is downtime especially at 4 players and also how annoying moving the pieces can be.  Would play it face to face anytime, but due to length and my game group at the time it was hard to get it to the table.  Luckily online is absolutley perfect for this game.  The game shines even more being able to easily view the discard pile and have the computer take care of all the minutiae of the rules and moving pieces around.  Online the game is pretty much 11/10 for me.

This is a really weighty euro that leaves you with many hard decisions to make at all times. Not for a casual gaming group but awesome with 3-4 good gamers. Still good as a two player also, though some options are missing with this player count. Takes 3-6 hours to play so best if you can play over two nights, leaving it set up. It sometimes seems to run a bit long: that's the only downside to this really good game.

I like this game a lot but without a map it leaves a bit to be desired thematically when considering it as a civ-building game.

I hate the stupid small tic tac playing pieces that come with it so I bought some awesome cubes from geekstopgames.com for it.

Fun game, my partner and I love building up our civilizations, although it always seems like you have so much to do and you are pressed for time!
 Would probably have preferred the newer version that has been balanced more over 1000's of playthroughs and with new artwork. But can't justify buying it as it's basically the same game =P

Would definitely recommend if you enjoy resource management and building an empire (through the medium of cards).

I played hundreds of games of this through BGO and now that there's an app with TtA in my pocket, I expect that number to skyrocket.

It's everything I want in a game and one of the greatest civ builders ever designed.  The changes to the new edition really snapped into focus the softer parts of an already great game.

I find the more I play this, the more my understanding of the game deepens and my playstyle changes.

A lot of fun so far.  I've played several Basic games and a couple of Advanced games.
Update: I've played several full version games now.  Definitely the best way to play.  Very tough to find the time though.  A 3 player game where everyone knows the rules takes us about 5 hours.  A 4 player game goes about 6 hours.  Note that a 4 player advanced game where there are one or two new players can also go about 5.5 to 6 hours.

This is the Trapped In The Closet of the "Build a Better Engine" systems.  Long and overly involved, repetitive, absurdly self-justifying and bulky.  Unlike R Kelly's bloated "masterpiece", Through the Ages works well and is damn entertaining. Engine games have now become the new Area Control, but if you want the big one, this is it (although arguably Antiquity is neck and neck).  

I think that the most important thing to remember about this game is that it is a card game.  It takes some serious cojones to make an 8 hour card game. San Juan just looks trifling compared to this.   I'm amazed at how smooth all the cards interact with each other, none of them stand out as being game breakers, nor overly useless.  

Perhaps what makes this so gripping is that you want to do so many things, yet you are constantly faced with new challenges managing your civ.  There is a wonderful hand management and planning aspect of the game that I really get into. You really need to balance everything out. 

Even though I really enjoy playing it doesn't mean it is a perfect game.  I'm frustrated by the fact that you can't just spend a civil action to discard a card from your hand. The penalty of losing two actions should be enough, yet there are no rules that help you get duds out, which can bring your civ to a stand still.  

I have to say, while funny, the Sid Meier card really cheapens the experience.

All in all, though, pretty brilliant.  I expect the rating to go up with more plays.

Update: This just isn't a short game, so it doesn't hit the table as often as it should. I go back and forth trying to decide whether it is best with two or three.  If you only do up to Era II with quick players then three players, Era III I prefer two.

RATING: 8
I wish this played faster; I'd be willing to pull it out more often. Does an excellent job of simulating the development of a civilization in the time available. Every turn is full of difficult choices. Some have criticized this for being too luck-driven; I haven't played it enough to perceive this as a problem yet.

Update: several plays later, I don't think luck is very important at all, but knowing the cards certainly is. Unlike RftG, the decisions you make early don't lock you into a strategy that you're stuck with whether the cards show up or not. Switching strategies isn't free, but it's not a game-breaker, either.

This is quite a fun resource management card game with some opportunity for aggressive skullduggery and killer combos.  Like most Euros, you want to do more More MORE on your turn, but are limited by several levels of resource requirements.  For example, to build a technology of any sort, you must first spend one or more of your precious civil actions to obtain the card from the display, play another civil action AND science points to play the card out of your hand, and then spend resource tokens to place a worker on the building, which then begins providing its benefit.  Oh, yeah.  The worker must have been previously produced from your population pool by spending food.  So, um, there's a lot of plates to juggle, and you have several cards on the display, active in your civilization, and in your hand to consider buying/upgrading/building, while still making sure that you aren't being passed militarily.  Because that would be bad.  I've only played with 3, and it's quite a delightful 2.5 hours.

I highly recommended this game. I wish it didn't come down so much to military strength in the final few rounds: this kind of ending can make the game very adversarial. (Perhaps, because of this, it's not the best game to play with your spouse). But it's a fun and addicting Civilization game.

Through the Ages is an optimization game with lots of fiddly bookkeeping, the bulk of which is done by shuffling cheap round wooden pieces back and forth across the board, except when they roll off the table, which they do. There's too much downtime and almost no interaction. Pursuing a military strategy may change that. I will never know. It seems less like a civilization game than a spreadsheet, and it goes on and on and on. There are gamers for whom this game was designed. I'm not one of them. One learning game was more than enough.

Captures the feel of the Civ computer games. Fiddly? Yes. Sub-par component quality? Yes. Yet I am completely blown away by this game, and it only gets better with additional plays.

*update*
Components issue has largely been resolved with the 3rd edition (2nd FRED edition).

Game is well designed, but not my cup of tea. It is too long and there is a lot of time spent waiting during turns. I like it when board games have a mechanic that constantly engages other players, and there is just too much downtime in this game. Still well designed with intuitive player boards.

From what I have played this is Civ building at it's finest...and most abstract.

Note - This rating reflects my personal interest in replaying the game and not the overall quality of the game. I found it to be very, very fiddly by sliding small beads from card to card.  When it isn't your turn, there is little to do, as the cards you can choose from change rapidly.  I grew weary of the game. The scope of the game is impressive, and I can appreciate this game for others who don't mind these issue as it is a civ-building game where you develop your own path.  I can see others enjoying this; it wasn't for me.Try it with 2 or 3 players.

There are 3 levels of game options - the Simple game, designed to learn the basic flow of the game and played from Antiquity to Early age; the Advanced game, which adds several additional rules like military attacks, territorial colonization, political actions; and the Full game, which likely adds even more. We were all new to it and decided to play the Simple game. 

Rules - The simplest (and still accurate/effective) thing is to say this: it is Sid Meier's Civilization computer game brought to board/card form (without much of the micromanagement)! If you were a fan of those games (I played I and II to death; haven't played III and IV) you ought to love this! 

Not quite a 10: I'm concerned that there's too much emphasis (more than I'd like, anyway) on the military. That's totally in line with the computer game, but may be a turnoff for some in our game group (we may have to try the peaceful variant).

--------
Update: after hundreds of plays, mostly online, I have to go ahead and bump this up to a 10. The military thing is still true (the updated version of the game fixes) but you [i]can[/i] just play a peaceful variant instead. This is, by far, the best civilization game I have played so far!

It sounded great to me and after playing just the basic game, it lived up to the hype.  The rules aren't that heavy considering the depth of the game.  I'm not sure what the best strategy is and there are a ton of different paths you can take.  I played with two and it worked great.  With three or four the game might move faster with everyone completing most of their turns simultaneously.  I'm looking forward to trying the advanced rules now.  As a side note, it has the distinction of being the 600th unique game I have rated.

Played it again with 3 players an advanced game:
Lots of downtime and I didn't like the agressions. They seem too much powerful.

18/03/08
Played with 2 the full game.
The downtime is better with 2 players.
I still think that although the rules say that this is not about conquering and beating and fighting, agression cards, events, colonies, wars are maybe too much powerfull to make such a statement. I know that this is a culture game, not military, but if you have a military force superior to your oponnent you may easily win. I don't like that in Through the Ages.

Christmas present. Reading the rule book is delightful - such a clever use of game mechanics to re-create Sid Meier's Civ. Very much looking forward to playing. First outing long and rather unforgiving- enjoyed every moment!

I think the game may have many flaws (victory conditions being one, down time...) - however, it's  my favorite game at the moment (Jan 09).

Lots of down time means i prefer with to play with fewer than 4. Edit: Need to try again with 4.

After 5th game realised that it will have a shelf life and that it really does feel like the best solitaire game i have ever played. Tried a military strategy which did not work. Desipte this still flavour of the month. For me a little like AOE 111 in that the experience is greater than the game it self.

7th game nearly got lapped by Michelangelo/St Peters. I like Michelangelo however my culture machine got caught in one game becuase i had used his wonder special ability to many times in Stage 1 and 11.

Games 10 -13 beginning to use and appreciate military strategies more. 

This game is my only 10 - I would (time permitting) always want to play it and can't see myself ever tiring of it

Great game.  Very long but very satisfying.  I am conflicted by thinking it would be great if it was shorter so I could play more, but I don't think the game would be as great if it wasn't as long. Edit: After playing this several times face to face but more recently many times online I have downgraded my rating.  I find that there is too much imbalance in the game and often the military is much too strong.

It seems to be a universally accepted truth that Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization is the ultimate civilization building board game. At the moment, it is ranked the second best board game of all time here on BGG. 

The game is a card game in which players are continuously working to get the best cards (which represents anything from armies to colonies to the great wonders of the world and philosophers that has changed the way of human thinking) for their civilization. 

Armies are then used to attack other players, while colonies produce goods and philosophers and leaders can give players different abilities and/or ways to break the rules of the game. All this is done in order to achieve culture, and at the end of the game, the players with the most culture wins.

My first impression after two plays is this game is long.  I'll need some more plays but it's very swingy on the scoring in the end like any Chv√°til game.  Unfortunately, I don't think this game will ever hit the table in my 4-player group.  My 2-player group and my 3-player group will probably play plenty games.  -1 for length and point swings, -2 for a confounding rulebook and the fact it's to long to play four player.

I would also wait for this game to go below $30 for purchase.  At $49, you are essentially paying for a card game.  There are quite a few wooden bits, and the card stock is high quality, but I'm not sure if the game should be priced this high.

Through the Ages is THE civilization building game.  It has everything you want in a great CIV game.   There is: military, governments, religion, wonders, science, raids, wars, colonizing, all in a neat card drafting mechanic.   Oh, it is good.  The ameritrasher in me wants a map with armies, capitols and colonies, but if you can get by the dry feeling layout, the magic emerges in the cards.    It may be a little long, especially with four players, but it is worth savoring.

From funagaingames.com 24 Feb 2007 (original printing).  3/23/2007: Only played the simple game so far, but can only see it getting better with the advanced game. 4/11/2007: played the advanced game - wow, a lot going on. The rules are easy to grasp but hard to master. 4/24/2007: Played Full game with Randy (two player).  Better than Advanced game, but with two players military counts even more. 2/19/2008: This is by far the most played game in my collection.  I never get tired of it.  Every game is different and always fun even when I lose (which happens quite a bit).

I got to play the (currently) number 1 ranked game on BGG, Through the Ages. I don't really see why it is rated so high. It is a good game but has many issues for me. 
The random way the tech comes out gives a tactical feel but all the cards will come out so you can be strategic. Sounds great right? Well, to make sure there is a chance to get every aspect of the abstraction there are a lot of cards to get through in each age. This makes theÔªø game to long. It also still has the problem if losing the tech you want to another player. While normally I would like that kind of interaction, the economy is such that you have focus on prepping yourself for the tech to show up. When it doesn't it really can stall your progress.
Next is the combat. Combat is a bit to much of a focus as there are constantly things coming up that are almost always good for the stronger player. For the direct player attacks there is no incentive to go after the stronger leader so players pick on the weaker player simply because it is an easier/safer way to improve themselves. You also can't see the combat coming like you can with a Civ game on a map.
The economy is interesting but Eclipse dose it similarly in a much less fiddly way.
I do want to play it again but I would never okay the full game or with more than 3 players. It has gotten me more interested in Nations.Ôªø

I think this is the game which I have played most often thanks to boardgaming-online.com. In my oppinion it is a very challenging game with many tough decisions.

A couple months ago I started a game of Through the Ages online. It just finished on Friday. I didn't win, but I wasn't crushed although I easily could have been. I stumbled into a powerful combo that kept my point engine on pace with the leader even as complete lack of experience left me struggling behind the curve in all other aspects of the game. I can see that it's a good game, but as fiddly and long as it is, it seems way too dependent on the order the cards are dealt. I'm going to make some comparisons to Puerto Rico because in my opinion, TtA is a heck of a lot more like PR than any "civilization" game.

Like PR, there are buildings/advances that are always good and some that are very situational and others that are underpowered. TtA is probably "flatter" in that regard than PR (PR has some buildings that just suck and a handful that, without at least one, you can't beat a good player). In both games, it takes some experience to understand the value of things. With so many more cards, it will take longer to do this in TtA.

In both games, tempo is controlled by the players and other player's actions are going to control you. In TtA, you're also being controlled by the order of the card draw. There are lots of cards. And lots of "good" combos. Almost all the cards are going to come out, but depending on random luck, the cards you want might be out of your reach when they come up and/or gone before you get to grab them. This adds a lot more replayability but also a lot more luck (which for me, is a bad thing in a 5 hour game). To make matters worse the big end-game bonus point cards (that can be 15% or more of your points-- per card) are drawn secretly with the military cards. The ones that have synergy with the point engine you created will probably not even be drawn by you (anyone could draw them and they might never be drawn). Instead, you might get a handful of crap that has no use to you while some other scrub lucks into a 50% bonus to his score. It reminded me of The Game of Life (The version with the ridiculous $50K - $1M life tiles that make the already useless game completely pointless.)

I see nothing in TtA that should make it compete with a "real" civ game. I'm glad I own Clash of Cultures. Expect me to be evangelizing for the foreseeable future.

TtA feels more like a VERY LONG game of 7 wonders. You "build" your empire with cards representing various "engine pieces" and try to manipulate the cards your enemies have access to while putting together the most powerful combos you have access to. Thinking of it that way, 7 wonders is a masterpiece* -- it's the very essence of an epic strategy game distilled down to 20 minutes and 21 deliberate decisions. There's really not anything more to TtA than that except a Vlaada math puzzle accompanying each decision and a [usually] free option to pick on the player that is probably already in last place. *Note that this comment is not meant to be a dig on 7 wonders. Its a great game for which my opinion has only been raised by my exposure to TtA.

I want to play TtA again, but wow, I don't think it deserves the lofty position it holds.

RATING: 7
Brilliant monster of a game with fairly simple rules: the complexity and interest is in the dynamics and the "data" (to use Donald X. Vaccarino's divisions). On the other hand, it's highly abstracted -- civilization qua spreadsheet -- and there's a lot of fiddliness and too much downtime with more players. It's definitely not one to get out with slow friends.

It's the kind of game where I don't like to use the word "strategy", which seems like a bombastic description for the kind of constrained micro-optimizations you get to make, within the serious constraints imposed by the system. The requirement not to ignore the military lest war cut you down to size is realistic but limiting, and irritatingly dependent on drawing the correct cards in order to initiate aggression. The lack of interesting interactions with other players is especially sad -- no trading, no negotiation (unless in an extralegal tabletalk sense), just comparing one player's subtotal in column A with the other's.

But, seemingly despite itself, it's an engaging, deep game, with a good arc and a strong feeling of progress.

RATING: 5
1 play, with 4 players.  I had not played this before, but everyone else had played several times before.  I agree with the polls in that this is likely better with 2 or 3 players.  It was dreadfully long and the down time between turns was too much for me.

I didn't like that you are strongly encouraged to pick on the weakest military person at all times with the military cards.  There is no reward for going after a stronger opponent and no downside to picking someone weaker.  This leads to "let's all gang up on the person in last" which is what happened to me, as it was my first game and I didn't grasp everything until about half way through.  That's something I strongly dislike in any board game.  Another player said this had happened to him before, so I don't think this experience was a fluke.

The second half of the game was brutal for me, because I had clearly missed some of the civilization areas that didn't seem to serve a purpose early on.  If you don't know this ahead of time, you're pretty much boned half way through the second age and especially by the third.  That's my fault, and I can forgive the first time learning experience, but I wouldn't plan on being able to catch up once your in last, especially with the gang-up factor from lacking in military.  You can't discard from your hand, so I was sitting there with cards that I planned poorly and there was NOTHING I could do about it!  I spent the second half of the game only using about half my civil actions because there was nothing left I could do.  Talk about unforgiving!  It definitely seems like the kind of game where the person in last is going to stay in last most of the game.  There's even a rule in the manual for how to quit honorably.  The mere existence of that rule tells me a lot about the game itself.

Also I didn't get any of the "bonus defense/colonization" cards until more than half way through.  Not a single one.  That seemed to have a dramatic bonus effect for those that did get these cards.

I'd play it again to give it a better shake, but definitely not with four people.  I don't think I'd ever enjoy this game enough to play for that amount of time again.  Even discounting the first time factor, I had enough problems with it to form the opinion that this this game wasn't designed very well.  Another silly thing: the cubes are way too large to fit in ANY of the scoring tracks.  How is this overlooked during play testing?

I don't think I had a worst first time play with a highly-ranked game since Brass, which is a terrible mis-mash of rules that don't make sense, shoe-horned loosely into a theme.

RATING: 7.5
[FRED Distribution 08 2nd (first printing) edition with fix pack] {Civilization; drafting, action-point, fighting, development, bidding; scalable} {Basic 6.5, Advanced 7.5, Full 7.5} Through the Ages is basically an Euro game with a civilization theme.  Players are essentially building a scoring engine with heavy resources management.  It is great that its theme and its mechanics integrate seamlessly and player could actually 'immerse' into the game.  TtA is multifaceted but I am concerned that possible strategies are driven by the card draw, even though a player have good flexibility to adjust his actions in the game. 

The basic game is good for beginners to learn the game, but it's too short with limited interaction and tactical decisions.  The Advanced and Full game are the only way to enjoy this game fully.

The production quality is only average.  The wooden discs are too small.  Cards and player boards are small, too.  There should be illustration for the pact cards.  I am disappointed with the production errors of the FRED edition, even though they release a fix kit.

Now this is a fantastic civilization game! It's essentially a card game with a board for book- and scorekeeping, but this is no run-of-the-mill card game. Holy sh... this is awesome! Players build their civs through three ages with the leaders of previous eras dying off with each new age. Tech trees are tracked with cards and small glass beads identify those cards that are currently active. Players must feed their populations, uncover brilliant innovations, discover new territories , build monuments, plan for possible military action, maintain the overall happiness of your people and more.

Until very familiar with the rules, plan on at least 1.5 hours playing time per player. My first game was with 3 players (myself the only newbie, using the full rules) and it took around 4 hours. My second game with 3 (first time for the other 2) took about 5.5 hours.

And while very thematic, this is a game of efficiency and engine-building, not tactical conquest. War and the threat of general aggression are part of the equation, but not the primary focus. Politics and economics, science and art... each plays an equally important role in the growth of your civilization. Just plain "wow".

RATING: 6.3
(2007) Played only one game - actually only half a game. I quit after about 4 hours and it seemed we were only half way through. Just too damn long and not much to do. It felt to me as if I actually played my turn in 5 minutes and then waited 55 minutes until getting my next turn. Boring.

(2012) Update:
Amazingly played two three-Player games (up to Age II) today within less than 6 hours. Is this the same game?
Obviously, playing time is very dependent of the AP affinity of your co-players. Upgraded my rating to 6.3. 

Finally played a couple of full (incl Age III) games with four players. Each game took us 6-8 hours.
I think this is too long for what the game offers.
Upgraded my rating to 7 nevertheless, after having seen the full impact of the game in Age III.

Another update after more plays on boardgamearena:
There is a lot of randomness in drawing the right military cards at the right time. You can spend many turns being the strongest military but never drawing an aggression or war card.

UPDATE 10-13-10: Tried it again. I find it difficult to find anything bad to say about the game when it's actually my turn. Well, okay it's fiddly as hell -- that's one bad thing. But the systems are well-thought-out and there are some neat ideas here. 

Unfortunately, with three players there was about a fifteen minute (on average) gap between my turns. That's a real problem. Any amount of fun I have during my turn is sucked dry during the considerable downtime.

--
Fun for awhile, but WAY too long. Definitely need to try it again.

RATING: 9
Wow...I wouldn't have thought this game could have been designed.  Beautiful, impressive game.  Really fabulous port of Sid Meier's Civ to boardgame form.

A couple of points of issue:  first, I'm not sure the leader mechanic works as well as I'd like.  It seems like Napoleon and James Cook have an disproportionate impact on the game relative to the cost to obtain and play them, but maybe that's just a function of the combinations I've seen.

Second, the military mechanisms are kind of orthogonal to the main play, which feels "right" but also creates some of the usual multiplayer issues which you hope to avoid in a long game--e.g. a nation has to pick which opponent to strip 40 culture from in a war.

Third, many of the late-game wonders don't seem to offer returns equal to their costs.  15 rocks to get a 1-off 10 culture seems pretty weak except in the very last turn.  It seems a bit of a shame that so many of these fly by and are never seriously considered.

But these are all nits.  The game is a marvel.  One of the best "epic" boardgames I've ever played.

Interesting game that captures the feel of a civilization, for both good and bad. The new edition vastly improves the ease of understanding the game, but I still feel there are a few balance issues with some of the cards (some combos give insane synergies). Also, the game requires a lot of fiddling with little pieces for maintenance (which are circular and roll all over the place). Some of the rules are a little weird and seem arbitrary, but that isn't a huge problem.

I feel the game is just lacking... SOMETHING from making it amazing. Not sure what yet, but I'm starting to see the appeal of the game.

This game is really great.  There's only about 8-10 turns per age so you definitely don't have time to do everything you want to.  The pace of each individual turn does seem a little slow and every turn there are tough decisions about what to do and what to wait to do.  
I was expecting to dislike the military conflict in the game, but I think it's a great part of the game, it's mostly a deterrent and an arms race rather than a means of winning. I assume that the dynamic changes in the full game with the addition of wars, but I still don't expect that many wars to get played.
Michelangelo does seem a bit strong in the advanced game.  Yes he was drafted for extra actions, yes you miss out on an age two leader, and on some other great benefit from a different age one leader, but even with only 2 happy faces, if you keep him until the end of the game it's 2-4 actions for ~18-34 points.  As an opponent I really don't think I can make up even 18 points in 4 actions. 2008/06/13

RATING: N/A
Uhhh, what a game! So many choices, so many possibilities. I played TtA more than 100 times and I'm not bored at all. The game is not heavy, but rather very deep, and a novice probably has no chances to win. But, personally, I have a huge pleasure of each play, even if I'm loosing. The feeling that I'm building the whole civilisation is impressive. Wonder, leaders, technologies - the PC original game (by Sid Meier) was perfect, but Chvatil made a huge job creating something even better: now, I can enjoy the game with my friends, not with a computer. The game is clearly more tactical than strategic: during each move, you need to consider your position once more time and adapt to the current situation (cards, opponents). 

I see two main things that made this game so delicious: the perfect system of many complicated elements that create the game and, secondly, the theme. I don't like typical euro-games (buy some cubes, move them from a card to another card, change your cubes to more powerful cubes of different colour), but in TtA you can feel how your civilisation is evolving, growing, breathing...

The queen of games.

Number of plays: about 124.

Complex and deep civ game I love playing. You need to take care of many aspects of your civilization. There are 3 "lengths" for the game, but I think the "Full game" variant is much much better than the other two (which are usually used when teaching new players). You need to have patience with this game; a 2 player game with experienced players takes around 3 hrs. From the beginning you have this feeling you don't have enough moves to do all you want and time runs so fast. We really enjoy it. Best civ game.

Really not sure of the rating. Perhaps a 5 really, or perhaps 6. Lots of good stuff, but wide of the mark in many ways. And not quick - this could and does easily take 6 hours for the full game.

Would be 10 if I could find players to play it with. It's just too complex for regular play.

While the rules are exhaustive, they suffer from wanting to be both a tutorial and a reference at the same time. Would have preferred a slightly higher price which came with more pages; that way there'd be space for both.

RATING: 9.5
Played this game one time and found found it an absolute joy! Keeps the brain constantly churning and it constantly gave me a fun buzz when I'd spot possible card combos and ways to play better and more efficiently the next time around. The game is kept tense by the need to keep up on the military track while you also need to keep an eye on your general strategy.

Currently the only thing preventing this from getting a 10 from me would be the components, which could have been higher quality material(and have larger graphics/tokens) given the price of the game
and the various tracks on the main board could have more readable graphics (why don't all the tiles on the tracks have numbers on them, for instance). This is a minor flaw, though given how fun this game is for me.

RATING: 4
THEME. I found this to be insanely pretentious to think that people would want to play this for 8 hours, which is my best guess on time but I only joined in after this game started. One has to either fool oneself into thinking this has any connection to history or you just love this bean counter stuff. 
EROGONOMICS: You move little markers to keep track of your military your culture and your economy or something. which is the kind of thing that drives me daft but I guess it's acceptable for this sort of thing. The cards are really too many to keep track of and most of them seemed to be useless but maybe I just didnt get it.
STRATEGY: I guess there must be some. You should innquire before you begin a game as to whether warfare is on the agenda [RED FLAG HERE] 

NARRATIVE: THere must be some although it felt so damn abstract to me I didnt buy whatever it was. Da Vinci emerging as your own nations' version of Napoleon is cute in a way. 
DRAMA: Again almost devoid of drama in a game about world history! 
BRAIN ENGAGE: You do this for 8 hours so you can imagine if this is not your cup of tea this will be awful. Obviously some people like doing this, it's like these are people left over from the 70s or 80s who actually still play games like this. If they enjoy it then God bless them. It's not for me. I think it bears repeating if you like this all day monster game stuff, you probably will like it as the play is pretty seamless and I did not recall many rules issues.

Played enough times to understand why this game is so WONDERfull!
Here we are! The hidden path to a better civ-game is now revealed! This stuff seems REALLY to catch and bring out the core mechanics of Sid Meier's son into a boardgame. Yes, there is no one terrain map, there aren't any miniatures or anything else to figure out the beauty of this theme, anyway this game is solid and clever! Different kind of strategies rise for every play. More you play and more you wanna play! With full rules playing in four it could be really long (6  hours)!

Now that I've played Civ by FFG, I really don't miss this game. Yes, it's an awesome design and it does a lot of stuff well. It is a very good Civ game and you do feel like you're building a grand city over the many ages of time. But not an empire. Which is where it fails the most.

The downtime, abstract war, no map, and the amount of counter pushing are part of the reasons that I don't need to play it any more, especially with a more Civ-like game out.

I had high expectations for this game and it just didn't do it for me.

All the fiddeling with the way too small 'dots' was a big turnoff as it makes the game slower and hence longer.

The cards just fly by, it gives the game a very stressed atmosphere that i didn't like. Was this to compensate for the extra time added by the dot fiddeling :D

Then there is the bug on the board.

And finally, the price.

All in all, this was not a game for me.

I think this was a pretty good game.  Played it once on the advanced game.  It's very fiddly with all the tiny components, but everything is laid out and done very well.  

I enjoyed the game, and how it felt going through history.  I think the game does move slow at times, especially when you're waiting on other players.  Which makes the prospect of playing with two or three only better than a full game.  Two players might be the best way to play this game.  This rating may move up.  

If I take out a second mortgage on my house, I might buy this someday.  It might actually be worth it.  But I don't know.

Fantastic game. Great depth and lots of replayability. I don't rate it a 10 because the manual is poorly laid out, the bits are finicky and there are so many obvious printing errors in various editions.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As with other games of the same designer: I really find that it has amazing ideas but also some important issues.

Bad things:

- The game is heavy, the rulebook is really horribly organized and different skilled players can't really play together.

- Most important problem: A player can (by the rules) abandon the game when someone attacks him. At the end, this provokes that this player (usually a player that would lose anyway) has to arbitrary decide the winner of the game.

- The game is very aggressive. I mean, if you're losing, you get attacked and attacked and attacked. No fun in that.

- It's a really strategic game, but luck may be a key factor. It isn't strange to see a player lose because he simply didn't draw any good tactic.

All in all, it is a really novel game, very different from anything else. If you can forgive the obvious design issues it has, it is an amazing game. However, you may also hate it for its issues.

My new favorite game. However, it takes time to get a strategy down, and is really brutal to get through as a beginner. Halfway through the first game, I started to understand the point of the game. Because I had no time to work on strategy, it was a great waste of 6 hours. Second game was not much better because we were teaching another player how to play, so it was again a 6 hour game. After that though, we all started to get into our grooves, and figure out our strategies, and we cut play time down to 3 hours. Wonderful 3 player game, Ok, 2 player game, and have not gotten a chance to play as a 4 player game. I could play this game twice a day, despite the time involved, and it would still not get old (as long as everyone playing knows what they're doing.)

Yes, it's fiddly and yes, it takes forever, but it's also interesting. :)

Very tough to play. The game punishes you very easily if you focus on one thing and neglect the other. Do not fall behind in military power or other players will punish you.

I love thinking what to do this time. So many different paths to take. While you have to do a bit of everything to develop your civilization, you can still focus on something. I seem to like games where I get to decide what to get for myself, in this case what cards to pick up from the board.

I am always down for a game of TTA, regardless of the number of players. It is an extremely well designed resource management game, and is just a blast to play every time.

My only complaint is that there *are* some choices which are just plainly horrible and unviable (I'm looking at you, Hammurabi). The game would be perfect if it increased the value of some choices, such as accumulating culture in the early game, for instance.

Great civ game: the short of map board is only a good thing and the flow of game cards, which is really fast, represent running of the time well. All in all, a lot of hard decisions in short play time.

I am currently learning this game. I like it. I think I like Sid Meyers civilization a bit better so far (talking about the newer version of civ from 2010/2011). This game is a bit more abstract and fiddly. May enjoy more as i play more and learn how to be efficient.

Hey, it is very much like the classic Sid Meier game Civ - but on your table. Lots of the same conundrums - balancing keeping your people fed while trying to maximize technology and advancements. Of course, you can't get it all and in fact, you barely get any of it.

After nine plays, I'm dropping my rating - a lot. This is a fun game as I described, but it has a serious rich-get-richer mechanism and zero way for you to catch up. Once you fall behind, you are not going to win and likely to get beat up on the rest of the way. That's not so bad in a short game, but this is not a short game.

What a great game!  There are so many things to consider in this game, from pushing food and energy around and building up a military and just trying to be efficient in as many areas as you can.

I liked so much about the game.  The tableau building was satisfying, the resource management was well done, and I liked how elegantly the cubes were used to represent people and resources.  As with all civilization games, military and science are critical, and it does both nicely.  There are definitely advantages to pursuing military, but you can't get wiped out if you don't.  Science is also pretty interesting, even though there isn't really a tech tree.  

One of my favorite aspects was the event stack.  Each turn you can play an event, but it goes face down into the "future events" stack, then you instead play a card from the current events.  When the current events run out, the future events get shuffled and become the current events.  So, you have influence on which events come out, but it is a delayed effect and you never know when exactly it will trigger.

Everything about the game is really well designed and implemented.  Vlaada just continues to amaze me with his depth.  Now, I just need to try out the new version!

RATING: 9
I know it shouldn't, but wars are bothering me in this game. I really like the civilization aspect of this game: raise your culture, give people food and happiness, build better temples, theatres and advance technologically. But there's always someone on the table who doesn't think this is the best part of the game; instead he starts a full-scale war and bombards me into oblivion since you can't do both, civ-building and building an army. And this makes me dislike the game.

I really want to like this game and I like everything else about it, other than warfare, but I've been disappointed game after game. And this is a even bigger problem with more than two players since the other players can continue his building and has time to enlarge his army and defence while I'm being whacked. Considering this is a two-hour (or three) effort, it's frustrating.

Maybe I should try the "no wars" -variant.

Edit: This hasn't seen any plays in two years. Problem might be that I prefer this with two players and as a two-player this is a tad long. I sold my copy to a man who needed it more desperately than I did. 

Edit: I've been thinking this a game A LOT recently, it's got a stellar civ building mechanic. I'll be getting it again. And this time I will play only with Peaceful Variant. No wars or aggressions anymore.

My favourite Civ-building game.  No map, which some people don't like, but I like the variety of strategies and the perfect balance of the interlocking systems.  Endlessly replayable.

I like to get paid when I have to do tedious accounting work. I don't mean this as hyperbole: it is borderline unplayable for me... and I enjoy spreadsheets.

RATING: 10
Longish and fiddly in some respects, this is still a riveting game. There is some downtime, but if players work at it, it CAN move fairly briskly. I wouldn't play with more than three players. Have played the two-age game several time, both as a two-player and three-player game. While these have been pretty long games, I've ended each one thinking that my development 'engine' was just getting set up, and each time I was curious how my setup would have performed in the third age of the full game. Gotta try that. Meanwhile, for the advanced game, my rating is an 8 with room for adjustment once I have a chance to play the full game. So far, I'd rate this as the best civilization-building game yet designed .. and there have been a lot of attempts. Update: Have now played the full game, and rating remains a solid 8. Often play the "peaceful" variant when playing with my wife, who enjoys building her civ but doesn't dig the conflict. There's still plenty of interaction and incentive to have a strong army even in the peaceful variant. Update ... continuted play tells me that this is a very tough game to master. I remain challenged and interested. Rating now a 9, and possibly headed to 10.

TTA is everything I was hoping it would be. Great euro/resource management game that also is a civ game. Plays great in non-combat mode, which is how my wife and I play.

Even though the game has no map, etc. I still feel like I'm building a civilization that spans the ages. I guess I have a good imagination.

I wish the playing time were shorter, to better fit my lifestyle. However, that won't keep me from playing. Great, great game.

Interestingly, for me this game has the "just one more turn" addictiveness, like the PC game.

Played 4 times now. Two simple games and two advanced games. While this is a very fiddly game with the bits and the removing of cards from the card display and then shifting the remainder down, the game is a streamlined version of Civilization that probably cannot get much better. Lots of food for thought in this game as many tactical decisions present themselves as one cannot always follow a full-on pre-conceived game strategy since the cards can pass through the board very quickly. Definitely interested in seeing how the full game plays out, but until we can get the 3-player advanced game down to 3 hours, we will be sticking with the advanced. I purchased the game at Funagain's fall 2009 sale for $36, but that is probably still too much for what you get in the box. Sure, the game is solid, but it commands too high of a premium for what one gets.

RATING: 7
Through the Ages is a very good game, and it is very thorough. The convoluted turn maintenance steps weaken the experience and round 4 seems to have a few too many scoring surprises.  But both need to exist for the game to work.  The engine is solid and the content is entertaining; it just kind of begs for a computer to run things.  Go figure.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A thoroughly impressive design in which the numerous components somehow flow together seamlessly.   The best economic engine (or, in this case, cultural engine) game that I've tried, largely because every aspect makes perfect sense within the civilization theme, and often in very clever ways (i.e., corruption).  Maybe the best strategy game I've tried for 3 players.

There are a few negatives, though: the rulebook is terrible for anyone who wants to start off with the full game and is not useful for referencing specific rules; the tiny round tokens are finnicky to handle; it's sometimes easy to miss changing your sliders, so almost constant audits are necessary; the game can take a really long time with more than 2 players, especially if any lack experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably the most preliminary rating I've ever given as I'm just through one session of the simple game. True, there is lots of calculating in this game. True, it is multiplayer solitaire. But it feels right! It feels like a building up a civilization. The cards match, the mechanics are great. It took me a long time before I got a chance of playing this, hopefully the next level won't take that long.  

Finally we got the advanced game in. Do your math! Since it is so much on the math, I hate to say that TtA won't exceed a 7.5 for me. And that's with a lot of benevolence, since I like the feel of the game.

RATING: 9
A big crazy beautiful beast!  We've now tackled the full game -- subsequent plays should be a little faster.  Right now this requires a very dedicated group and a LOT of time.

But in truth, doesn't matter.  It does what a good Civ game should: makes time vanish in the blink of an eye and makes you sad to win, because now it's over.  We've just started to get to know each other, so maybe I'm still in the infatuation stage, but I love everything about this game.

Edit: OK, time matters.  If you screw up and find yourself out of contention, playing it out is frustrating.  The "leaving honorably" rule goes against my sense of gamer etiquette.

Further edit: With experienced players this is now very doable at a pace of about one hour per player.  I've done a 2p game in under two hours and that qualifies it for a ratings bump.

It can be hard to remember a lot of the smaller rules all the time, but a good game when you want to play something with some real weight. Building up your civilization throughout the game feels really rewarding. Plays great with 2 players.

Update: I never get to play this because of the length and the amount of time it takes to re-learn it every game, so I'm glad that we now have Nations. Nations is basically just a streamlined version of TtA that makes the rules much simpler and the gameplay more fluid. Will be selling this in favor or Nations. 

Update: Sold, and bought Nations.

This game is one of a very few games of its length where I can look down at the board and look up right after and three hours have passed. There's a certain momentum to play - each move impels you to make certain others, and the consequences of your actions are long-lasting. Like Agricola, you feel like you never have time to do everything you want to do. And like Agricola, the sense of accomplishment is very satisfying.

RATING: 9.5
I want this game! 

UPDATE:: I have this game! My only concern is that it will collect dust as most of those I game with are intimidated by a lengthy game. I wish I could change their ways so they understood that great satisfaction comes from a game with depth, and that often means a bit of length.

UPDATE: Played my first game yesterday. I had to meet up with a stranger! He wasn't the greatest teacher ever, but we worked through it and fortunately, I had spent a lot of time trying to figure out the rules myself. The only issue was that I had planned for the simple game and he wouldn't play it. He wanted to play the full game--we compromised by playing the advanced game. So I had no idea how military worked or political actions worked. It took me the better part of the game--scratch that--the whole game to figure it out. I probably still don't totally understand what was going on. This is a deep game and it takes a while to understand it. But I can see how playing it a few more times will get me hooked. I'll hold off on rating it until I get at least one more session.

UPDATE: I got my second play with my wife last week. She really struggles with learning long, complex games. She was a sport to try, but I definitely call my effort a failed one. :( However, I've become very familiar with the online interface at boardgaming-online.com. So I've been able to get my fix there. The game is brilliant. I sum it up with one word: hard. It's hard to build your civilization. It's hard to balance your strategies. It's hard to become weak in any aspect of the game. It's hard to imagine a game of this complexity come together so well. But most of all, it's hard to stop playing. If you have the abundant time, the proper opponent, the desire for complexity, and the money to spend on this game, get it and love it.

I'm finally giving it a rating after a lot of time and patience spent in getting to a place where I can give it a proper analysis: 9.5. Its length and difficulty to learn are the only things keeping it from a perfect 10.

UPDATE: I've bumped my rating from 9.5 to a 9. Lately, I'm noticing that the two-player game is rarely close. By about the middle of Age III, I can usually see who's going to come out on top and it's rare that the difference is less than 50 points.

I've now played 16 games online. Usually, I don't count online plays in my playcount, but this game is so long that I think I'm justified to do so. Plus, it still feels like a boardgame. The site has done an excellent job with the interface.

I've only played one three-player game and it finished much closer. I'm in the process of two others now, and they both seem more balanced also. So I'm beginning to think that the three-player game is better than the two-player game. I'll update upon more 3P games.

UPDATE: Now up to 25 in my playcount and the majority of the last 10 or so have been three-player. I'm bumping it back up to a 9.5 because of the positive interaction added to the game solely from the pact cards. In a two-player game, the only interaction is aggressive interaction. The pact cards add a twist of brilliance. They're probably my favorite aspect of the game currently.

What I've noticed about TtA is that the more I play it, the more I want to dig and discover...and I can see the well is far from dry. It is brilliant.

UPDATE: This is my current favorite game. And it has been for several months now. It just doesn't get old. It's the most satisfying gaming experience I know. It is my precious. I'm bumping my rating up to a 9.75. It's going to take a very good game to dethrone this one. And my guess is if it happens, it will probably be from the same designer. Vlaada is king.

::UPDATE::
10/14/13 - Still my favorite game after approximately 180 games. It's just so deep and delicious. I wish all gamers (especially my wife) knew how to play this game so I could play it with everyone. It's currently rated a 9.8. If my wife liked it, I'd rate it the perfect 10.

RATING: 7
The game is very well designed and the mechanisms all interact very very nicely.

Overall the rule set is quite minimal and the depth to complexity ratio is quite good, you get a lot of game to chew on without needing to focus a lot on looking up rules.

The only downside is the length of the game, it is quite long.  Even if you played at a rabid pace I can't see a 2 player game getting finished in much under 2.5 hours and with 3-4 player you are probably pushing 4-4+ hours for the full game.  

You can speed up the game with an assembly line like structure for the maintenance round but that can also make the experienced feel rushed.  Due to this and due to the fact that this game definitely results in players "rolling back" their half completed turns frequently it is probably best played on an App...and that makes me sad to admit.

The new version gets a slight bump over the old, the components are nicer, the play is slightly streamlined, the Military aspect is tamed slightly and the cards have 10+ years of balance, however the box footprint is at least doubled...which may irk some.

In short very good game, but can be quite long and fiddly.  I'd probably never shoot down a 3 player game of this but it might also be hard to find the other 2 players considering the time commitment.

A phenomenal strategy game with a very interesting central mechanic.  Probably my favourite sorts of games are ones where "bad players" THINK there is a lot of luck when in fact there is almost none.  This game definitely falls into that category.

The game's biggest flaw is that there is way too much downtime between turns with 4 players, and sometimes even with 3.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
An epic civilization game.

This game's sense of accomplishment is great, and the interaction is also stellar thanks to the arms race which is very well implemented. The core economy is fun and deep though also a bit fiddly. There are tough decisions, and both strategy and tactics play a big role. Luck is minimum (only card draw) and overall, the best player will win with rare exceptions.

There is only one major flaw to this game, and that is downtime. In practice, I suggest this game with exactly 3 players, unless you have a highly trained group of 4. Even with 3, downtime is an issue, though not so big.

I'd rate this game higher but for the downtime. Still, it's a very enjoyable experience.

Update: Having played Nations, a clearly superior game that scratches the exact same itches in my opinion, my desire to play Through the Ages has greatly diminished and my updated rating reflects just that.

A truly rich gaming experience. The mechanics are elegant, the decisions are interesting and plentiful, and the feeling of building a civilisation is captured perfectly. I have played the advanced and full game now and have to claim that TtA is one of the most epic CIV style games out there. I can't wait to play this again.

I managed to play a 4 player game of this finally and love the game. I really dig what's going on here and found I enjoyed myself very much. There is a lot of down time in a 4 player game (2 of us were noobs though) and this would be the only factor that keeps it from a 10 status for me. It might still reach that plateau but I'll need to get a copy and see how it plays 2 players with my girlfriend. 

UPDATE: Lowered by one. It's just too complicated of a game to teach and then there's such a huge learning curve that any experience will squash those who don't have it.

I've tried Through the Ages four times so far, twice with 2 players, once with 3 players, and once with 4 players, and it's a game that I really want to like.  Actually it's a game that I really want to love.  I could see it being my favorite game of all-time in a parallel universe.  In a universe where I only owned a few games and played Through the Ages a lot and was able to both explore its depth/replayability and get past its fiddlyness.  But unfortunately I don't live in that universe and I'm stuck evaluating Through the Ages based on my experiences with it up until this point, which have been lukewarm at best.  As a huge fan of Sid Meier's Civilization computer games, I wanted to fall in love with this board game, which shares so much in common with those computer games (especially because the designer of Through the Ages, Vladimir Chvatil, came up with the brilliant idea of doing away with the map in a civilization game to make it playable in a reasonable amount of time, which isn't an idea that I could have possibly conceived as working before trying it out in practice).  However, I just didn't love the experience, and found it too fiddly, the cards potentially unbalanced, and the downtime between turns to be excruciating.  I'd probably be willing to give it another chance and play it for a fourth time, but for now I'm happy to cross it off my list of games to consider purchasing.

A bit too much randomness for a game of this complexity and length.

Too fiddly and therefore easy to make mistakes with all the shifting bits.

You can just lose.  And quickly.  It's brutal and unforgiving.  And it has some randomness to it.  

The rulebook is horrible and the way you learn the game progressively by playing different versions is odd.

[thing=25613][/thing] is a civilization game that is basically made of cards and some tokens. The games takes you from Age A, I, II and III, making your civilization pass through leaders, new political orders, technologies and developments regarding: farms, mines, arena, labs, libraries, temples, theaters and military - these are general names, don't take them to the letter (like, journalism is a library development, cavalry and infantry are of the same level give the same bonus, and such). The winner is the player with the most culture by the end of the game, but during the game you will have to manage other things as well: food, resources, army, hapiness, population and ideas (is with ideas that you "discover" new techs, new political orders, enhanced military units, and so on). Everything is important, and you can use them in different ways to achieve the same goal (more culture).

A player turn has two phases: event phase and action phase. In the event phase you can start wars, agressions and treaties towards the others civilizations, and also you can play events, that will trigger latter, and thus you can prepare for it. In the action phase you use the avaiable actions to increase population, discover techs, put people to work, build wonders, put a leader in play, and other things.

The game doesn't fell as a civilization game to me. Maybe I'm too visual person, but the lack of a board, miniatures, or tokens representing the armies, the new colonies, take away the sense of place, distance, size and quantity. I can't see and army closing in. I don't attack a given place, I just... attack the whole civilization, not a region, nor an important city. [thing=25613][/thing] is way more abstract than I like my civilization games.

Also, more often than not, the game will be basically an arms race, in which the players try to build the biggest military might in order to beat someone else. And, as the game works, many times the one to be crushed won't be the leader. Will be the one with the weakest army, and this can (or can't) be the leader, but it won't matter all that much. And, then, things can go to the "bullying" side, because, if someone attacks you, and you defend (using cards and sacrificing units), you open your civilization for an attack of the next player, and again, for the next (considering a 4 players games, in wich the next player after you attacks you), with you getting weaker everytime (and, thus, making even better to attack you). I really do not like this aspect of the game.

So, [thing=25613][/thing] is a solid game, for sure, but not one that fits right with me.

RATING: 8
The "simple" game: Obviously for learners. It does play fast and isn't very fiddly. Interaction is nearly nonexistent though. You buy cards from a market, but the market refreshes so quickly (no stagnation problem here!) that it lessens the feeling that you're actually drawing from a common pool. While painless, managing your civ/economy is not particularly interesting.

...The full/advanced game is a different beast. It took awhile for the flow of the turns to feel natural (the player aid is quite helpful) but eventually TtA gave me the same "just one more turn" feeling that Graenaland did; I may need to look closely at Chvatil's other games.

It [i]is[/i] basically another economic bottleneck/snowball game (which I initially found annoying), but as in Graenaland there's a varying menu of things to do on a given turn, and you can't do all of them, they have different effects, more than one way of doing things seems like it may work, and the variation in options doesn't feel arbitrary or unexpected or chaotic.

The player interaction is a bit odd. The card market functions very well but doesn't feel like the heart of the game (moving bits around on the player boards does) and doesn't feel like a major source of interaction (partly because of the speed of regeneration of the market and partly because it usually doesn't seem worth it to buy any but the cheapest cards).

The interaction largely comes from the literal arms race of the "strength" metric (like a complicated version of what 7 Wonders has). A player lagging in strength can get beat up badly with no consolation prize. The main thing that moderates this is that strength is also used as a bidding currency to get territories, so that a strong player will probably try to convert as much strength advantage as he can into the territories and their perks.

TtA has even less of a sense of "location" than 7 Wonders. I'm quite OK with not having a map (mostly because maps tend to bring their own annoying issues in multiplayer games), but I feel like the game would feel a bit less abstract if there had been some nod to the fact that civilizations don't just all start out next to each other.

...Having now played a "full" game (all three ages) I have a couple extra thoughts. I'm disappointed that (despite being a civ-themed game) the game doesn't really have a different feel from age to age. The numbers get bigger but the gameplay doesn't feel qualitatively different. I think this makes the game feel too long and less "epic."

Secondly, I can't wrap my mind around how the player interaction is supposed to work. You can play cards to add to your defense but not to your offense, meaning your inherent strength needs to be substantially superior to your prey's to attack them. But it seemed to me that it was generally far too expensive to build a large military.

The whole package [i.e. after playing a game] leaves me with the unpleasant feeling of "that was pretty interesting to play, but I don't want to play it again for some time." (I think I had the same feeling from Graenaland actually, except I like that one a bit better.) I could see this being fun with a solitaire variant, if someone has made one.

...Revisiting: Actually, the MPS logistics puzzle of managing the bottlenecks of your economy seems to be the most interesting part of the game. The uncertainties of the card market and the player interaction might even be net detriments to the game's quality, though I could well be wrong about that (meaning: surely these forms of interference add interest to the logistics, and reduce calculability, as beyond your current turn you can't be sure what will happen).

Lautapelit's Nations is actually quite different. The MPS economic logistics are much simpler and you don't have a set of uninterrupted moves to juggle at one time. The player interaction is central to the interest and needs to carry the game.

Another noteworthy mechanism of TtA is the event seeding, where the game bribes you to schedule events to occur at some random point in the future. It's an interesting middle ground between giving players direct control over firing off events (which is typically unthematic) and having the events occur at random (which can be too capricious in a strategy game).

very good meaty civilisation building game.  Would recommend as a minimum playing the advanced game, however with 4 (of which 3 had played before) this took 4 hours, so set a full games session aside for this.

Vlaada is an amazing designer. It's engaging, intricate, and rewarding, even when you're doing terrible. More than most games I have, it really tells a memorable story. The time to play is long, sure. But it's not excessively long: there's always fascinating action going on. So many ways to reach for victory, a great amount of interaction, both direct and indirect, and in the end it's just wonderful. My only complaint is that I don't get to play enough!

TtA is almost perfect game. Best with 2 players and full game. 3-player game with fast players is very good too, but 4-player game just takes too much time to play (about 6 hours). Actually 3-player game takes too about 5 hours to play, but there isn't so much downtime compared to 4-player game.

Advanced game seems to finish too early and some of the leaders are way too powerful compared to others. But in full game I don't see that kinda leader problem.

Is there a luck involved? Definetly there is but I think  that luckfactor is pretty small. 

Quality of cards and board is very low but game itself rocks.

edit. After few games more, there truly is a luck factor. For example if you are making strategy towards Cook and territories. Strategy seems to somehow depends on one card, Cook in that situation.

The game mechanic is interesting but the components are too small for my liking. 

There are various areas which the players have to manage. I like the idea of being able to use the number of actions to obtain cards. The cost of obtaining the cards will get cheaper if they are not taken by players. There are trade off between paying a higher cost for a desired card (e.g. leader, technologies, military, wonder etc) or waiting for the cost to reduce but risk losing it to the opponents. 

Players constantly need to strike a balance between the food, resources and technology required for upgrading in their race for the most culture points.

Played a second 2er of the advanced game, and all I can say is wow. We plowed through a 3 hour game and I dont think either of us moved from our seats. 

This definately fits the bill for a meaty two player epic civ game, that moves at a brisk pace and is not encumbered by too many rules. 

The game was neck and neck until the very last turn. Very tense, exciting and fun. Looking to play more.

Way too long and death spiral for my tastes. The resources are nonsensically restrictive (you have no choice to sit for hours through random events just hoping you might get enough resources to DO ANYTHING.) You have to study through repeated play to know which cards are useful and which should be avoided.  I'm not devoting my life to this game.

I just acquired the Component Upgrade Kit (no big deal, just clear instead of wood cubes. Not sure there's really any benefit at all to game play, but they might hold up a little longer if the game ever gets played!)

I never finished a full game. If you can play a game for six hours, you have more free time and better friends than I do. You're probably also in college. Given the meager amount I played, its appeal was still evident. It distills the slow pleasure of building an empire that is found in Civilization (PC) into a (admittedly six hours) board game. Given my situation, I'll stick with the PC game.

Nice, I want more. ***UPDATE: Having played a couple of more times including one full game to the end I'm a little afraid that the Age III wonders are game breaking. It seems like they gie such a huge point swing and who gets them is to a very large extent decided by luck. More plays will show if thats the case or not.

A fiddly but interesting stab at a Civ game that keeps things manageable by removing the board and replacing it with card drafting for a common focus and interaction source.

The designer successfully dealt with one of the major problems with Civ games, beat-on-the-(perceived)-leader via military.

Unfortunately, his solution often results in beat-on-the-loser being the correct ploy, where the loser sometimes has ignored military too long (I'm ok with beat on the loser in this case), but all too often has simply been unlucky in the order of how cards appeared.

Further, if this happens (which is over half the time in our group, which may be aggressive), it's typically only 1/3 of the way in the game and it results in one player being completely out of the running.  From then on, the correct tactic is often to keep on whomping on this poor player.  

It ain't pretty watching people apologize to someone -- who is just playing to keep the game going -- before they beat him up another time.

Any game that encourages beat-on-the-loser as a central tactic is not for me. I don't enjoy either side of that. Bleah!

(I don't know whether the new edition has addressed this problem or not.)

In general a good game.  Takes quite a while to play.  Has the flaw that since there are fewer upgrade cards in each age for mines than there are players, a player can get stuck behind by missing the 1st age iorn mine and is really out of luck if the coal mine, 2nd age, appears late in the age.  Making a player continue with little chance of doing well just for this reason seems like a bad idea.

I like this game a lot and would play it more often if people in my group wanted to.  Would not play it with more than 3 players due to long playing time.  Other than that, my biggest gripe with it is the rule book. I wish they would have made a complete book for the full game instead of doing it in stages.

Update: We played a 4 player game and it was great, but it did take over 6 hours.

The thing I like most about it is how it really delivers on the theme.

Initial rating/feeling after one game (short game): 6. Oh man this game is fiddly...

updated rating after second (full) game: 6-->7. It has its good parts, for sure. However, in the end, it feels quite abstracted and restrictive. I'm not sure I like the randomness related to the events and card when combined with very restrictive mechanics (like that there is very little you can do, if you don't have say enough materials or food). For example, I don't think it is very intuitive that if you happen to end in a situation where you produce too much food, it will eat you alive as you cannot produce hardly any metal (due to corruption)... to cure the mess, you need to do quite convoluted steps. There isn't too much flexibility in the game, which I kind of miss (for such a long and complicated game, where it is easy to screw yourself and the luck plays its part too). And of course its long and complicated game with lots of rules and details you need to remember.

But despite my ramblings, obviously it is good and clever game.

This is THE civilization game and is proof that not all civilization games require a map!

The story arc is beautiful, and the gameplay is fantastic. It's an engine builder with resource and card management. Changing strategies on the fly can be difficult but it's something that I personally don't mind and find thematic.

2 players is arguably a little wonky due to the strong emphasis on military (although I admit that I'm always trying to get away with as little military as possible). I'm definitely looking forward to playing it with 3 players which hopefully alleviates the issues.

I upgraded the components immediately with the cubes that you can purchase from the Geekstore and can only begin to imagine how painful it would be to play with little cylinders which roll straight off the table!

Waiting for the updated version so I can add this back into my collection!

Simply fantastic. It's the only game I will drop everything to play. My roommate and I would play this three or four times a week after we both got home from our respective jobs. 

There's a little bit of luck involved with what cards are available and what's drawn which keeps the game fresh. Ultimately, your destiny is chosen by you.

Essen 06 Radar.  This is a great game with a really good sense of development.  I played the advanced (but not full) game.  Some card combinations might be overly powerful, but I hope it gets a few teaks before the rumored full production run (finger crossed).  My opinion of the game is higher than my rating would indicate simply because the length would prevent me from wanting to play it too often.  I haven't played Civilization, so Parthenon is actually the closest relative to this game that I have played.  They both have a similar feeling of growth and progression, but while Parthenon is very symmetrical and growth is more limited, the selection of cards makes this much more free form and open ended.  That also means is has the potential to be unbalanced, but that didn't happen in our game.

RATING: 9
Reminds me of Age of Empires the PC game except for the fact that your mouse clicking speed is no longer a factor since TtA is turn based. I think this makes the game more strategic in many ways except for in a spatial sense due to lack of a map. The book keeping is definitely a disadvantage compared to PC games but seeing your opponent face to face is a positive.. The game is however quite long which decreases my motivation to bring it to the table.

For its length too much run away leader.  Enough fiddly rules that we never feel like we have played a game without mistakes in our cube shuffling and other gray areas.  Why have different rules for the first 2 rounds?  We could never justify that.  Was interesting ride for a few of the games then clearly down hill..

Got it as a gift for my brother-- I like it, but I'll probably need a play or few more to really get a feel for the game before I rate it...

(updated 1/1/11): I was expecting more from it, but the full game 2-player seems very zero-sum (which drags down the options). Maybe with more people, but I'm not sure if/when I'll get that chance. I am not a huge fan of the 2+ hour Euro-style games, though, so I feel this may have ran into my Agricola/Puerto Rico bias (so I can easily see why this game is up there with them).

Game includes many concepts from computer Civilization without map. Very elegant design and feels balanced. Game is maybe best with three players. Downtime with four players is maybe too big at least in full game. In strategic perspective full game is the beaf. Much culture points in early game -tactics are too powerful in advanced games.  One of the best boardgames ever.

Long. Really, really long.  If you have the requisite 4+ hours to spend, however, it can be time well very well spent.  I know that this game is regarded as an approachable civ game, but I think it would be more my speed if it were half as long.

This is a very good game, but it is *very* long and there is a lot of moving parts and administration between turns.  Plus, there can be a large amount of downtime for a player between his turns.  Its not a game I'd want to play regularly, but maybe when I have 5-6 hours to burn.

RATING: 6.5
Initial Impression; limited plays.  

Seems to move too quickly and take too long at the same time.  It's really, really close to what I want in civ game  though.  The military seems to have a bit too much of an impact (though this is somewhat dependent on who you play with) and later player turns can tend to drag (plus the card row makes it really, really difficult to try to "plan ahead" in order to mitigate the length of a turn).  This is pretty much "the" civ game to measure all other newcomers by (seeing how it is unlikely the old civilisation game will get re-released).

Not a bad civ game, but not great either.  The amount of time it takes to play, down time between turns, and upkeep during each turn would all get better with more plays, but the game didn't hit me as being that great, so I don't see it getting more plays from me.

RATING: 7
Not a very pretty looking game or layout but the gameplay itself is fantansticly strategic.  Most civilization builders emphasize specialization and leveraging those advantages against an opponent.  This one emphasizes a need for a bit of everything with a loss in momentum if any one area is overlooked for too long.  This causes much of early game specialization to be focused on allowing a player to ignore that area for a little while rather than fully develop it to its maximum first.

Hmm.  Long games like this are almost always complex enough that there is at least one major rules ambiguity that causes major frustration at some point in the game.  Not that big of a deal in a 2 hour game, but REALLY annoying in a 6 hour game.  I also sort of feel like I should just play Civ on the computer instead of playing this, though it some have some interesting unique aspects and I did mostly enjoy the overall gameplay.

The glass bits in the first edition suck, and quite literally add to the length of the game.  Worker/Resource management is significantly better in the 2nd edition, though still fiddley.)

NEVER play this game with 4.  The advanced game through Age 2 is probably just a much better game than the Full Game is, but I'd have to try Full once more to be sure.

Great game that really evokes the feel of building up a civilisation over time. It takes a while to play and is quite fiddly, though, so is a fair investment to play. Interaction is low, however, as I haven't so far paid much attention to what my opponents are doing, but probably only because there is so much going on on my side of the game. However, there is interaction with wars and aggression, and even without them as you have to keep up in the arms race.

RATING: 6
This game fell far off from my expectations. Unnecessarily complex and aggressions that completely obliterate others. I sometimes get hate feelings toward games on my first plays but this one really took the prize. However, there is some weird pull of the good kind here, mostly from the complex mechanics. But these complex mechanics make me not want to play it any other way than on the computer due to the massive bookkeeping hassle.

The obligatory comparison to Nations is unavoidable, this game is a lot more versatile but also a lot more complex, where Nations is streamlined and "friendly", TtA is brutal and user-hostile.

+/-Versatile and good game mechanics that are sadly a bit complex and the overall design is user-hostile in that there are too many tiny different fiddly rules to keep in mind.

-Military, impossible to rise once you start taking a beating every turn. This is among the worst implementation of wars I have seen in any game. Here you actually lose and you never rise because others can simply keep milking the weakest unless they start wanting to sabotage their competition instead of the easy prey, however that would leave them open to failing their aggressions, so kicking the decked one is the best choice mostly. Going with the non-aggro version might be more my cup of tea, but after a try with this I don't see this solving all the problems either.

Very good civilisation game, long, quiet complex and involving. A lot of similarities with Nations (that came out later but I played earlier and much more than TTA), so of I compare them. 
I give the edge to Nations, because I love the asymetric factions and the streamlined resource management (fewer fiddly moving parts); nations also has an excellent handicap mechanism to allow playing with new players without crushing them. I also feel than nations is more replayable and has more diversity (in terms of wonders, leaders, etc.), I would love to try with the expansion.

[+] Solid engine building game, frustrating in a good way (you never have enough either actions, or resources, or science, etc. to do everything you want), the military aspects can be intimidating but it's hard to really crush someone (unless multiple player gang on the leader, which could happen, best to stay in second place as long as you can ;)), I like that all events are triggered at the end, it creates a big points swing but you can plan for part of it (the ones you contributed);
[-] very fiddly with moving blue resources back and forth, loooong game (the shorter versions are not worth playing), the randomness of the military cards (can be frustrating to be the strongest nation and draw a bunch of defense cards, or the opposite) maybe having them in a second card row would be better (bought with military actions);  I like the Pacts but there are too few of them, same for military tactics, it's cool but so dependant of the card draw

RATING: 8
Civ without a map sounds like heresy, but this works well.  This game is really the spiritual descendant of Civilization series for the PC, much more than a spiritual descendant of Tresham's [gameid=71] board game of the 80s.  

It's very well designed.  Every time you think you have your civilization functioning like a well oiled machine, it springs a leak and you realize that you have to improve your agriculture [i]right now[/i], or that your science levels are woefully low, or some other thing you didn't notice.  Sometimes you run into some really odd anachronisms, such as Leonardo da Vinci leading a theocracy, but for the most part it gels well.  

There's one big flaw, one that I just can't forgive, even after nearly 20 plays.  The Age III military strategy tends to swing the game wildly.  It turns something that's been a fun little game of developing your culture and science into a brutal militaristic punishing game.  It's punitive to the point that it can ruin the fun, and the end of the game is a tight-lipped grim march to the gallows rather than a triumphant race to the finish line.  Still, I'd forgive this if I didn't see it happen so often.  Experienced players know and anticipate this dynamic, but it takes the life out of the game for new players.  Time and again I've seen new players wilt when their big lead and weak military is confronted with an Age III War on Culture.  If military was more powerful in the earlier two ages, this wouldn't be as big of a deal, as new players would have more incentive to build military early and would know to ignore it at their own peril.  

Still, this game is tight and beautiful and one of the best Civ games out there.

Very fiddly with lots of bits to keep track of and lots of ways to make mistakes. Doesn't really feel like a "civilizaiton" game and you get get a bunch of really odd unit match ups (Warriors vs. Tanks?).

However - it is still fun and a good game for 2 or 3 players. It's involving and the mangement of your civ is fun. It's more like a resource management game and a classical "civilizaiton" game.

I was reluctant to like this at first as I felt the development arc was scripted, but with repeat plays I have seen a variety of fundamentally different viable approaches to the game (it helped to play with a couple different game groups to realize this). Through the Ages is really a great long heavy game that remains tense from beginning to end. The only negative thing I can say about it is the price, and the fact that there's probably too much downtime between turns with 4 players. With 3 this is pretty sweet though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's hard to compare this game with another one, because it seems to do something that isn't found in other games.  There are a lot of rules that make the game beat you up from one turn to the next, sort of like Antiquity, but it's more easily managed than in that game.  The limitations of different parts of the game make you want to do more on any given turn than it's possible to do, which creates a nice tension from turn to turn, and since the game essentially forces you to pay attention to all possible strategies, at least to a certain extent, you're going to feel squeezed by the game.  It's really awesome. 

The game is ridiculously fiddly, and the rulebook seems to raise a lot of questions.  It really requires someone who knows the game well to teach it, because there are lots of things that players need to know from the start of the game, such as not neglecting their military strength.  Players who don't plan for this WILL LOSE.  Period.

The game works very well with 2 players, as well, which surprised me, considering the way the end of the first full game played out.  I can see why playing with 3 would be better (the pacts come in to play for one, and the cross-competition would make for more interesting choices), but I would gladly play this as a 2-player game, too.

This is very definitely a 9 game for me, even after only playing it 4 times.  There's just too much a player can do, and so many different strategies to play, that I can't imagine ever not wanting to play this game.

8 plays: 2 players (Full Game)
1 play: 3 players (Full Game, through Age I)
4 plays: 3 players (Full Game)

As a big fan of the Sid Meier's Civilization series of PC games, all I can do is shake my head in amazement. I am absolutely floored by Vlaada Chv√°til's take on the classic franchise. Somehow this incredible design feels every bit as epic as the computer game, with a clever mechanic to represent almost every feature that makes the computer games so great. The way new discoveries appear and fly across the time line. The way the tokens interact with the player board to represent growth, stagnation, famine and corruption. The way territorial expansion really stretches your military thin but ratchets up your ability to grow again. It all just works so well. Even more remarkable is that it creates this wonderfully detailed civilization experience completely without a map! It truly is a stellar piece of game design.

There are only a couple of downsides to the game. One is that it almost does too good of a job portraying the original computer games. If you have never played any of Sid Meier's masterpieces, a lot of the more abstract concepts of Through the Ages may be difficult to wrap your head around. The rulebook is a bit of a chore as well, but in some ways I suppose that is to be expected from such a complex game. Finally, the price being charged for this game is absolutely ridiculous. Considering that the components are mostly cards and some small wooden cubes, I'd say the price is almost double what it should be. Yet the gameplay lurking inside that box is worth every penny. I can't get enough of it!

Christmas hollidays 2009. I'm learning this game solo. I play red against yellow so I can try different build ups.  First solo-game was the Simple game. Loved it! 

Second game was a Full game not finished..loved it even more! So much to do with not enough actions. Lots to consider: Food/Resources/Upgrades/New Buildings/Military Build Up/Happy Faces/Corruption etc. etc. and while playing I lost track of time, wife and kids :). 

I was playing for 3 hours and had a blast. Next time I'll try and finish the game! Great game already!

Played my 3rd Full solo-game and didn't finish... was playing for 4 hours, still learning rules and searching answers on BGG on questions I have. The FAQ sure helps! Still playing red  yellow. Yellow got stucked and Red rised above the (civili)n(z)ations. Yellow had some grow opportunities, but I had to stop and take some sleep, almost midnight :).

Maybe next weekend a 4th Full play and completing?

My rating reflects my admiration for this game during my solo-sessions , wonder how a Face to Face play will be...

There's a lot to like here. It's challenging and variable, tactical and strategic, and has loads of turn angst.  I'm not sold on the military system (draw luck, incentives to beat on the weak, the uselessness of aggressions and wars when everyone is--sensibly--keeping pace). I also wish there was some uncertainty about what's in the stacks, and not just about the timing.  So bring on an expansion!

But I know of few games that generate this kind of turn angst. I have a lot of little nits to pick with it, but it's freaking brilliant.

Most of my plays are via the nice interface at boardgamingonline, which has spoiled me. Much easier to play that way than in person. Plus it has some variant card sets (new leaders and wonders), so...hard to justify owning/playing the physical copy. Would rate BGO a 9, FTF a 6.

There are lots of tiny bits that need twiddling here, but that was the only downside for me (well, maybe aside from length).  The card-drafting mechanic works great, and (somewhat surprisingly) not having a map doesn't hurt the civ-building feeling at all.  If you like the Civilization PC games, and you like board games, I have a hard time imagining you not liking this game.

There's a lot of things I really like about the game, but the point-at-one-person nature of wars and agression is something I can't stand. I think that is simply a design flaw. This is the main reason for my rating.

(btw this is based on one play, where I was the agressor, and won the game, but I almost didn't want to do it, but I said, okay let's play the game how it was designed. it seems it was designed for this, because I won)

There is also considerable luck with the cards, some of which is fixed by the new edition.
The game is also very long, which is understandable from a mechanisms viewpoint, but I'd just rather play two or three or ten other games. Also this length means that other than taking some interesting cards, you never really feel you did something big, but then again, just taking a card is not too interesting. I actually like the fiddly administration part of the game, but it never felt like it really mattered other than to not make mistakes there.

I guess I should try the simple game without agression.

edit: I did try the simple game. It's clearly not what the game was designed for, it's only maybe good for learning the rules. Didn't help my opinion.

This could be the perfect civilization game.  More play will tell, but the mechanics are simple with plenty of options on whether to concentrate on armies and attacks or advancements.  You need a population to accomplish the card tasks but you need advance to get more people.  The rules are well written and the game appears very balanced.  Got the English version at Essen 06.

A great design and a fun game. Only knocks I see might be the randomness in the cards and the need for knowledge of the decks - especially the military deck III. However, the randomness is more or less negated by the play time of the game, and the deck knowledge will not be an issue with all experienced players.

Update: Had to knock the rating down a point and a half for the Withdrawal rule. It is too easily abused and if enacted for rash reasons will likely ruin the game for me. My desire to play this otherwise great game has been substantially lowered.

A Civ building game playable in 2-3 hours.

3-27-11 - Upgraded to a 10.  This is a game I look forward to playing time and time again.  

5-6-12 - Revised to a 4.  After playing this quite a bit, I have noticed a lot of flaws that have cropped up.  This game is close to being a gem, but the random factor compared to time investment is way too high.  Additionally, it is far too easy to fall behind and bash that player repeatedly with no hope for them to come back.

RATING: 6
Wow...the box looks surprisingly small,  considering the hype and the MSRP.  Then again,   things always appear larger on the BGG I'm finding.Game is interesting - the bits are small (I guess I should have expected this from the box).  Maybe this is a trend from publishers - ItYotD was maybe 10-25% too smalle,  Through the Ages here could probably be double it's current size.  The size issue is mainly the tiny little cylinders that are tough to pick up and roll away when you drop them,  but there's also the mini-sized cards.  The Simple game seems like your standard engine building game - probably helps to know the deck,  and you convert resources into points.  The Advanced and Full game adds more interesting and more powerful cards...but all the pushing cubes around gets to be probably too much overhead by the end.  I'd also rather the whole thing took maybe a third of the time.   Growing on me a lot (well,  winning doesn't hurt).On the upside,  it feels surprisingly a lot like Civilization,  with happiness balanced with resource production.  You need to spend resources to have workers,  and then you assign them to various tasks.   Mostly seemless once you get going,  although the "worker spontaneously morphing into a building" bit got me confused for a while.  That part doesn't really make sense (why do my buildings mysteriously vanish when they're unoccupied)  but having more to track would probably make it fiddlier (and it doesn't really need that).Hmmm...I think I'm overly hard on this game just because I want to like it so much.  I keep thinking of ways of "how would I make it better",  or "how would I steal mechanics to add to another game".  Lots of good ideas,  but not quite there.  Actually,  a lot like Prophecy in that respect.I agree with Chris Farrell's assessment of the military subgame - the results are pretty much random,  and a lot of actions are spent "oh I'm behind a point,  now I need to get another one to not be behind" with the first person to be out of luck "taking it in the chin" - losing is just as bad when you're 1 military off than a whole lot.My biggest issue is that the game's solution to the compound interest problem is making the cards exponentially more powerful in the more advanced ages.   The Age III military technologies (and esp. tactics) are crazy powerful.   Those final wonders - buckets of points.  But unfortunately,  where they end up on the track is pretty much down to random luck...you can control it a tiny bit - 1 card position or so - but really - if the other person gets his stuff for cheap,  and you have to pay through the nose for yours,  you won't be a happy camper.

Makes me want to steal the ideas for my own game :)

Starting to see that this is not so much an engine-building game as it as an auction for the military - Age III military is so overwhelming that it's somewhat ridiculous.  It makes thematic sense of course,  but does mean that whoever "breaks" on that track will be out.  In some sense,  it's more about building war machines that happen to score points on the side - I guess I like the engine building bits more than the military bit,  so I'm biased,  but the engine is looking a bit like obfuscation rather than actual meaningful choices.  It is very expensive to redirect workers in this game...

I've really had a lot of swings on this one.  After a lot of thought and another play through, I am comfortable that Michelangelo isn't an automatic win; provided that at least one other player makes some commitment to a significant military strategy.  You need military involvement to make this one a game.  If everyone plays peacefully, Michelangelo will probably win.

The game is a bit long to be much higher than an 8.  

My other thought is that 3 seems to be the optimal number for this one.  4 doesn't add much except a lot of time.

I've only played this once and it was online at BoardGameArena, but I really enjoyed it. I was pretty sure I wasn't going to like it though because it was missing a map, something I thought was incredibly important for a civilization game. However, as we played I didn't miss it. I think my favorite part of the game was the gradual growth from a civilization with rock tools and the beginnings of a civilized society, all the way up to a modern culture. I'd definitely be up for playing it again, but I hesitate to buy it for three reasons:

1. It's a very long game and I already have far too many of those, one would have to go
2. The publisher is working on an iOS version that would probably get played more
3. The publisher is also working on a 4th edition of the game with upgraded art that looks far superior to what's in the 3rd edition

Received as a Christmas 2009 gift from my father and step-mom, due to my wife tipping them off that I was interested in it once.  I do love the PC games (since Civ2) and was curious about a highly-BGG-ranked game based on the same concept.

Thoughts after one play: it was a pain to setup and break down (couldn't ANY other shape have been picked that doesn't roll away so easily?!), was a bit arduous and took persistence to learn enough to play through once (anyone with a little less patience would have shelved it permanently), but the play was interesting enough and the learning curve behind us enough to be interested in trying again, hopefully sometime soon.

I tried so hard to like this game more. It's got civilization, development, resource management, technologies, the sweep of time, a good 2-player mode. But I get too frustrated by the limited power and slow development of civilizations, the intense emphasis on precise efficiency, and the interlocking limiting factors. The main intellectual activity is maximizing your 4-7 actions for efficiency. However, there are so many limiting factors, that you end up conducting the least bad options, and feeling frustrated that nothing is happening. Even with that, I still enjoy the game to some degree, mainly because of it's theme. About 7-10 plays.

Spelers sturen hun beschaving vanaf de oudheid tot het moderne tijdperk. Ze ontwikkelen hun beschaving op cultureel, industrieel en militair gebied om uiteindelijk de sterkste beschaving te hebben.

De diepgang in dit spel kom ik weinig in andere spellen tegen. Zowel de directe interactie, diplomatie en puur denkwerk zijn allemaal goed aanwezig. Er is geen enkele zekere weg tot succes, iedere strategie heeft zijn zwakke punten. Ook al duurt het spel lang, het boeit van begin tot eind.

A game that I really want to love, but it's size and numerous moving gears make it a difficult sell. In addition, some cards were never updated and have symbols on them that aren't listed anywhere in the rule book or game board. If you find this version, skip it and get the new one.

Rating based on one play. A bit long, and you can definitely get in a position mid-game where you get behind, and it soon becomes clear that you are going to stay behind until the end, even though you still have an hour to play. FRED production quality is lacking. However, it's a pretty clever system, and there are some cool combos you can get going. Expect the rating will go up a bit, but doubtful it will go much more than a point up. 

After a few more plays: It's long, and fiddly, but pretty amazingly good for what it's trying to accomplish.

RATING: 8
Excellent euro-style game for those who don't mind sitting down for a couple of hours and thinking/planning/ and definitely pushing some cubes around...all to build your 'civilization'.

I love how everything ties together in this game. Greater population = more production = more food required = more production upgrades required....and so on and so forth. Add to this the variety of special abilities afforded you because of your current leader, and add to that the ability to beat up your neighbor cause they might get more points and this all comes together in a flawless game. It's a civilization game for the thinking man.

I really enjoy this game. I do not do well yet, but I love a game where every decision I make is effective and all the moves I make have a real gaming purpose rather than being simply a visual to google over.

Terrific game. Period.

True story:

While I was out sick, my wife and teenage son - who only game "out of the house" a few times per year - were roped into a four-player learning game of TtA without being told that it would take forever.  Being too polite to quit, they gritted their teeth and rode the torture wagon for a full six hours before the game ended.

Did I mention that the inviter was a deadly slow player, and one of the most confusing game explainers that I know?

Horrified at the news when my family returned home, I took matters into my own hands and two men are now dead.  I don't feel the slightest bit of remorse, even though my cell block's wi-fi is unstable and my top bunk mattress is lumpy.

Let this be a lesson: Don't sucker people into playing your grossly long "favorite" game, particularly if a close relative has anger management issues and non-specific life goals.

Played three times (once with each set of rules, with 2 or 3 players). An ambitious game which works quite well. The main flaw would be the fiddliness, but overall the rules are a great adaptation of the Civilization computer games, made playable as a board game, and with interesting additions. I have yet to play the full game, but from my play of the advanced game and my reading of the rules, it seems to be quite promising. Rating is likely to go up, especially if the full game can be played in a reasonable amount of time once the players are experienced enough.

Excellent boardgame adaptation of the original Civilization computer game.  I loved the computer game and this boardgame gives me the same feel.  The game is engaging throughout.  My one play with 4 players was too long, but that may have been only because one of the players just didn't get how to play.  I enjoy it best with 3 players, but 2 is very good as well.  It takes 3-4 hours, but the time flies by when you're playing.

Update after 10 plays:  Bumped up to a 9.  The game is varied and engaging.  It's a constant balancing act that requires the player to respond to many competing demands.  I like to play even though I don't think I've ever won because I enjoy the feel of the evolving civilizations.  I like that the pace of the game quickens as the end approaches.

This is a great great game with a brilliant design . Still so, TtA is a constant struggle to obtain food, ore, happiness, culture, defend yourself, colonize... I mean, it's exhausting!!! And it has even given me headaches. (also, the components and the art are probably the worst I've ever seen)

I really value the challenge and the design behind this game but I really don't play games just because of the challenge, I play games to have fun... and, honestly, this game is 90% challenge, 10% fun. Also, there's no catch up mechanism in this game at all, so usually there's always one player who won't enjoy the game and will be beaten to death repeatedly for 90~120 minutes straight. That's not fun at all in my opinion! It's a shame, I can see why people like it and I don't want to be unfair, it's just not for me.

I love the computer game versions of Civilization, and this board game perfectly captures that feel for me. The randomization of the card decks pushes you to try different strategies each game rather than locking into one approach. I prefer this with two or three players. With four the overall length and downtime between turns in the final stages is a little less fun. I also prefer playing all three ages, though playing just two for a quicker game is fine now and then.

If players are ok with a weak player threatening to kingmaker another player into a win as a defensive tact to stay alive and un-attacked it works but for those who dont like or use such playing its brutal directly punish the weaker player game. 

For this genre I like maps and the dance they provide -- so with this on the table i'm always left wanting to play better (with map) games and alliances of diplomacy they provide in their dance of spatial positioning.

But man a lot of my friends love this!

Incredibly well designed. I don't find the mechanics fiddly at all once people know what they're doing, and there's just so much interplay between the cards and the mechanics. I also think the notion that this is multi-player solitaire is nuts. The importance of keeping your military even or ahead of the other players, choosing when to spend 3 civil actions on a heavily-desired card, deciding whether or not to seed an event... What your opponents do has a tremendous impact on how you play the game, and I'm always watching and considering my opponents' choices. Apart from the steep learning curve, a simply incredible game, one of the best designs ever.

Played the basic game. It was VERY basic and ended when I felt like we were finally picking up the game. Time of play may mean the full game is not an option, so we'll have to see how the advanced game is. 

Friend's copy was sold, but in retrospect I just don't think the game was for us anyway. A little too much abstract house-keeping and not enough civ-building. If this was an app, I'd get it in a heartbeat though.

A bit too long. Its heart is certainly in the right place, though. Would prefer a different way of distributing military events - sort of lame to have a conflict between skilled players come down to who got the aggression/tactics card first. Components have minor issues - the pips roll around way too much and the cards are too tiny to shuffle in my enormous hands. That said, I do in fact enjoy playing this game despite the issues.

Deep civ-building game that doesn't actually run long with experienced players. Three is our sweet spot.

Just describing the game is a beast. The game takes place over roughly 25 turns where players build their own civilizations by drafting cards from a shared pool and managing resources within their own kingdom. Culture is the victory point resource, but wars or aggressions between players can transfer culture to / away from a kingdom. So your final score is essentially how much culture you can create on your own plus how much culture you gain / lose from other players. Then players manage civil and military actions, science, food, energy, and several other supporting mechanics which help support everyone's bottom line - the culture engine.

The finesse in Through the Ages lies in understanding the interactions between those secondary elements. Over time, cards increase in power but also cost. So, for example, if you are deciding between Drama (2VP,1HF) or waiting for Opera (3VP,1HF), you are going to consider:

1) Can I afford the increased ore cost of Opera?
2) Can I put three people on Drama versus two on Opera and get near the same benefit for less ore, but more people?
3) Do I score more with Drama because I have to wait until Age 2 for Opera?

The core resources are ore and food. Spending food creates new people, and spending ore puts idle people to work either in military or civil service. Both resources contribute to your effectiveness - having all the food and ore you need lets you put the most people in the best positions - but you really never have all you need in every area, so it's a balancing act. Having more food and people but less ore incentivizes military because aggressions typically take ore from other players. Or, it makes cards like Shakespeare or Bach appealing because those leaders give benefits based on how many, not how much. Having fewer people and food but more ore incentivizes the creation of wonders and putting your people on the best possible spots, such as Journalism.

The secondary resources include civil and military actions, science, and political cards - mortar to the bricks of food and ore. There are six unique leaders every age that provide reductions in cost or benefits contingent on different parameters so every game plays differently and there is no one best strategy. You want to optimize but must also consider timing, synergy, and the capability of your opponents to interfere.

There are some clunker cards like Library of Alexandria or Bread and Circuses but the vast majority of cards are viable if you understand how they fit in to a larger picture. For reference here's a list of the game's all-stars:

Michelangelo
St. Peter's Basilica
Constitutional Monarchy
James Cook
Journalism
William Shakespeare
Air Force
Fast Food Chains

As far as flaws go there's clearly some luck involved, e.g. I have colonies is James Cook at the top or bottom of the deck, or I'm drawing three military cards per turn and can't find an A2 tactics. Air Force is borderline-broken and I wish there were a few more tactics in A2 instead of some of the junk pacts / greens.

no room for improvement of the ranking here; this is a great game.  fun, complex, and longish.  lots of things to think about and do, not enough actions.  damn good.  the age cards give terrific thematic immersion, and the balance between military and civic improvements always keeps you thinking.

RATING: 8
This game has a very steep learning curve, so much so that the rules come with a recommendation to play the Simple and Advanced games first before progressing to the Full game. The rules, whilst easy to understand, are difficult to refer back to when my Significant Other and I encountered questions on numerous small issues during the game. It is perhaps best to have a experienced friend to guide you along. 

Once one understands and remembers the basic rules, this game is very challenging, engaging and replayable. The game mechanic and historical theme of this game is particularly enjoyable.

The design of the cards and tokens is the main negative. The illustrations are not very attractive, and the tokens used to represent population, resources and such are small uninspiring cylindrical tokens of different colours. These are small enough to make them slightly difficult to handle. Player interaction is also rather low, especially for two players.

Rating would be somewhat higher with better card designs and perhaps more attractive tokens. Or at least larger ones.

I had this at a 10 for a long while, but once you gain a certain level of skill you will find that certain cards are never used while others very much sought after. In other words, balance is a problem, which means less variety in strategy than there should be. Which in turn means that the game has less replay value than it could. Ultimately, I got tired of it, though I still get pulled back in every once in a while by online play.

Not sure I can rate this! It's obviously not a bad game, but it just didn't work for us when we tried it. So many bits and pieces! I saw the new version at the UKGE and it looked somewhat neater, but I might need some nudging to feel like I'm not just playing Civ and doing all the bookkeeping myself. Definitely would give this another go though.

If you like Sid Meier's Civ games you can't help but like this.  While I enjoy the map aspects of a full civ game the balancing act in TtA is a lot of fun and the escalation of abilities through technology cards and upgrading your civilization's abilities really give this a nice feel.  I've only played online using 'Boardgaming Online' and really enjoy the game's presentation in that format.  

As I play more I'm starting to dislike the conflict a bit though.  Its interesting to balance having enough military with your other needs, but if you lose the race you can get pounded right out of the game.  I don't like player elimination so that's a black mark against this game I'm increasingly not enjoying.

So this is still a game I respect... I'm just not sure how much more I actually want to play it.

What an engrossing and thoroughly satisfying experience!  Through the Ages left me wanting for another play after I was done with it.  However, even though there were a wide selection of cards, some were just overpowering compared to others, and there were ones that didn't seem particularly useful under any circumstances (almost like complete throw-aways and were just there to occupy spaces).  Also, while I think having the possibility of conflicts is an important aspect of a civlization game.  Everyone was so busy in building their own culture and avoiding confrontation that the war aspect of Through the Ages ended up feeling totally superfluous and unnecessary.  I assume this will change depending on who you play with.  Even so, I enjoyed my first play of this and would consider it a current favorite of mine as I look forward to exploring its potential further.

Update #1: A general lack of enthusiasm on my part to get into another game of Through the Ages has forced me to deduct a 0.5 point from my original score.  I even traded away the pre-order copy I had (mostly due to the poor production quality) and since haven't had the desire to acquire another one.  I still maintain that is is a very fine game and one that I appreciate immensely, but I also recognize that in order for something to age well, my desire to play it must remain high.

RATING: 8
There are many thing about this game not to like, but somehow I still do. On the surface, the design looks like endless bookkeeping with visual attractions varying from horrible to nonexistent. Like in all card games, some players get all the right the combos while others don't - or in the case of Through the Ages, lack exactly one action, food or resource to make them happen. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to do anything about a rival who takes a decisive lead.

Still, there are plenty of subtle of mechanisms to bring balance into the game. There is randomness, but it's manageable randomness. After Brass, the lack of visuals and eyecandy is not a big issue. The game keeps your mind occupied, when you constantly have to weigh decisions, their advantages and drawbacks. With different rulesets, you can play a shorter or a longer game. After severals hours of play, the gaming table doesn't look like that much has changed, but there's rarely a dull moment. There's always a new plan to make. Altogether quite an enjoyable gaming experience recommended for serious gamers.

Good luck with the rules.  That rulebook doesn't make stepping up to the Advanced / Full game very easy.

Finally an update, 2012:  Someone better than me taught my dumb ass this game, once and for all.  I don't "love" civilization games, but as far as they go this one is rather fantastic.  Once you learn the over-the-board version, just go play it online at boardgaming-online.com rather than fighting with all of those little pieces.  Could they have made them any worse??  I think spherical would be the only way to do so.

RATING: 7
A game of thousand flaws from modern-gamer's perspective: a lot of downtime (or to put it differently - you need to enjoy looking at other players turns if you want to play this one), too long (4 hours for 2-player game if you are moderately experienced), fiddly (too small pieces and cards, lots of upkeep and mathematics at the end of your turn), but also a game of one unmatched virtue - it is the only real civ-builder with an epic feel (Nations does not come even remotely close, although mechanically it is a better game from modern gamer's perspective). It is also unparalleled engine-building game. 

Development of my thoughts:

Was very hard to memorize the rules at first so remained on the shelf unplayed for almost a year... But then...

Also got frustrated after playing Nations only because it has mechanics of one action per player - so it's more involved and faster, and not so much solo multiplayer as TtA where one has to wait a bit too long for his move. 

Otherwise I would still choose Tta for its depth and epic feel. With Nations I don't feel such a fulfillment when looking at my civilization at the end. 

Update 26th June 2015: Finally went through rules and played full game with spouse - rating adjusted accordingly (from 7 to 8). Faults are obvious: too much downtime and stressful bookkeeping - too much opportunities for error. We played full game through 3 evenings, which is way too long. 

BUT on the other hand it delivers: there is no other Civilization game like it, Nations doesn't come close for me because it lacks that epic feeling - it may be better game all in all, more developed in terms of play-ability, but TtA gives you the essence of civ management "Sid Meier's style". 

Another potential con, but only for game's reputation, is the lack of map and visual appeal. Once you get into it you realize however that Civilization was never actually about the map - there are other games that serve the purpose of "moving your pieces / area influence gaming", and TtA still has spatial aspects, territories and wars for them, just abstracted in (to me) still odd and hard to grasp Vlaada Chvatils mind (heck, I couldn't comprehend Dungeon Petz first time through - so it has to be my mind not resonating with this particular designer at first contact).

One thing I really admire is the one for which I also rate Twilight Struggle highly - that wonderful ability to capture historical flavor in such an abstract system. Leaders above all, but also fine details like how getting to communism by revolution is stimulated with very low science price comparing to other government technologies or how Robespierre influences revolutions or how Bach combines with theaters and so forth. Extraordinary.

Update: Traded away when New Story showed up. Decreased the rating accordingly.

Very abstract civilization game without a world map. You really can fantasize your civilization. Cards are a little bit to small as are the various wooden counters. The look of the game could be better, though it encourages you to use your imagination i guess.

TtA is really neat if you've played Civ on the computer.  I can't imagine how awful this game would be to someone without that reference point.  Many mechanics are designed to simulate the game. You need to be able to visualize why certain mechanics are there or it seems like it would feel like overwhelming and meaningless token shuffling.  Even though it is a very fiddly game, I had a good time with it.  The game balance seems very good.  There are no cards which are useless.  Different strategies seem viable.

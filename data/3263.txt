Second edition is a big improvement, but still not as refined as later Simonitch titles. Since I played this after N'44, it was difficult to get past the seemingly clunky mechanisms and inelegance of two map sheets. Still fun to play, with an excellent cartographic presentation as you come to expect from Simonitch

This is my first game in Mark Simonitoch series and I like how he has refines the operational level rules with some nice extras, but I feel this particular game is not very interesting for the German player. The Soviets get all the offensive choices and the Germans are limited in there response. The Soviets have some supply restrictions but they can still rule the board with some proper planning. I like the ideas just not with this particular set of scenarios.

Comments and below apply to the 1st ed., not the recent 2nd ed. The 2nd edition is an improvement in many ways; although I miss the intensity dice, the new edition is much more playable and exciting without really losing any detail or historicity. Of Mark Simonitch's recent games (France '40, Normandy '44, Ardennes '44, Caucuses Campaign), this is the most interesting as a game - lots of back-and-forth, thrust and counter-thrust. It's big but the 7 turn games are highly playable. If you're a counter-pusher, can't recommend this one highly enough.
---
Now that I've become more familiar with it, this game has gone up in my estimation considerably. It's still awfully long, but the smaller scenarios are still good.

Great game on a situation which doesn't get a lot of attention, as the Soviets break out after Kursk and send the Germans reeling back. The systems are neat and the situation interesting, as the Soviets have the numbers, but the Germans are tough on defense and dangerous on the counter, and have the Dnepr to help stem the tide. Hinze Crucible of Combat is a detailed companion but as much of a slog as the campaign

Shouldn't have bought this. After playing France 40 several times and deciding I didn't like the system,I am trying to sell this on Ebay, so far without success.

Very Nice game. Very long indeed. It has a lot of Chrome, it gives you a lot of feeling for the period but detracts from the time needed to play.

The game is good but it takes too long for learning to play and takes too long to actually play the darn thing to conclusion.

RATING: 7
Update: Bought the 2nd edition and played most of the first scenario. The good news is that the designer streamlined the rules for the new edition, and it looks much nicer in general. While large, this is definitely playable, and it's nice to have an operational game that isn't a monster. I like the general ebb and flow, with the Germans using their panzer divisions to backhand the Russians when they stick their neck out.

On the downside it is long, at least if you want to play the full campaign. There are shorter scenarios, but the VP conditions could cause some gamey play if you're playing competitively. The mobile assault rules were a bit underbaked as released, and there's already been official errata to deal with the German "death blossom" tactic. My largest concern in general is probably replayability. Given competent maneuvering and placement by the Germans, I think it will largely come down to how much and how often the panzers take damage in their counterstrikes. Still, it's worth at least a few plays.

---

I just picked this up recently, punched it out and set it up using the historical setup. It looks nice.

Reading through the 2nd edition rules, it's similar to The Caucasus Campaign in many regards, but with the complexity jacked up about 1 notch.

Looks like fun. :)

This game proves that Simonitch is one of the best designers of all time. Not in terms of originality, but his games are tense, balanced, and use the best concepts of previous designers. What I like most here is the primacy of attack. Losses are high, but a well led strike has a strong chance of gaining ground.

Oh, and the rules are tight and clear. My first session was a piece of cake.

This one is a winner and one of the few games to cover this important but oddly forgotten campaign. Indeed, the Soviet's ability to attack right after Kursk was decisive.

One of few Mark's games that I do not like; my major gripe is the unlimited number of combat factors involved in one combat which can grow to ridicullously high numbers in this game (combats involving >60 attacking combat factors are not unusual). The other thing is--though it is subject to personal taske--the fluid nature of frontline. Blame my limited experience but the mobile nature of the war in Ukraine'43 just does not speak to me. While not a fan of attritional warfare, I also am not a fan of patching up holes in routinely fractured frontline.

But then again it may be me being sour: I played it four times, lost all, some of these in terrible circumstances, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

RATING: 7
initial rating; I rate this a bit below France '40 and Ardennes '44 since it seems a bit slower to play and the German counter-attacks are a bit repetitive.

this will sound bad, but I would call this my least-favorite Simonitch game.  of course, I rank all of his games pretty high.

concerned that in the shorter scenarios you can game the system - for example, in scenario 1, give a ton of ground in the North and stand and die in South - no VP to lose up North in 7 turns, and lost units don't have any impact when the world ends on turn 7.  this wouldn't matter in the campaign, of course...

Medium complexity with enough chrome to keep the East Front grognard happy. The new ZOC bond system works better than the classic ZOC rule. The Germans have a nasty ability to counterattack, making it a very dynamic play. However there is a price for all this, game lenght, even the 7 turn scenariso will take 6 or more hours to play.... PS. Recent changes in the rules have made it easier fo the Germans, addressing some of the pro-Soviet bias of the original.

first play impressions...

Factor-counting and the constant dance of units to find the perfect odds ratios is very prevalent here, and those are a couple of things I have grown tired of, especially in a game with this unit count.  His Ardennes'44 game managed to avoid a lot of this due to the nature of that area's more restricted terrain.

The initial Soviet attack rolls might determine a game's outcome before the first turn is over, and it may be hours of playtime before new players have realized it.

The game is very old-school and much of the playtime is spent on things I am not interested in (see above), but the game situation is fascinating, the Axis situation quite unsettling...it is a feeling of near hopelessness, but when any of the three panzer corps are free enough (and intact) to do fire duty it's possible to calm the Soviet storm in one area before rushing to the next.  Whack-a-Mole

The tide has changed. But the Germans wanted to hold on in southern Russia. "On August 3rd, 1943, less than two weeks after the Kursk offensive, the Soviets launched a massive offensive near Kharkov that ripped open the German line. The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to theT Dnieper River." The offensive lasted until the final fall of Kiev, capital city of Ukraine, in Nov 1943. 

When we set up the game, it really looked like a military operational map in front of you - the general. Both sides, digging-in, formed a frontline continuously, seamlessly along the fortified line with every hexes being filled up, from Stalino in the south to the bulge of Belgorod - Kharkov, to flanking area of Ril'sk and Sumin the north. There is a historical set up card if the players want to deploy the units according to their historical positions - something I did for the Germans during the game.

Five German Armies, two of them Panzers, defended the fate of Army Group South, after retreating, some sixty miles, from Kursk. The Soviets were stronger in terms of the number of men, organized in four Fronts, poised to attack the Germans where they were weaker in the flanks. The city of Kharkov was surrounded by a belt of forest, giving +2 bonus to the defender's strength. The fortified line and the Northern Donets River halved the mechanized units' strength (rounding up). The fortified line (fortifications) also +3 to the defender strength while the river -1 to the attacking non-mechanized units. When attacking cities and fortifications, the attacker losses one additional step if he rolls 1 to 4 on the primary dieroll on the CRT. It's called "Heavy Casualties" int he game. The terrains conferred the advantages to the defender naturally, making the combats mostly at odds 2-1. No doubt why Hitler and Manstein made a decision to stand here. Another wondrous concept is the determination of "magnitude" of a combat. Additional one dice is available if the side with fewer steps has more than four steps in an engagement, two dice if more than six steps. These are called "secondary" dice, scoring additional hits on the second column under the odds in the CRT.

Compared to the designer Mark Simonitch's other later designs, Ukraine '43 still retained a sense of traditional, well-defined but convoluted sequence of play, whereas both sides had the same sequence played reciprocally, got to move and attack two times during their respective turn while reacting once in the enemy's. Units, except for those with restricted movement rates in a black box, can also move with an increased movement rate of three so long they do not end up adjacent to the enemy ZOC. They can use this kind of extended movement even they started the movement in enemy's ZOC. The extended movement is limited up to ten stacks only.

During the exploitation phase, mechanized units can also perform mobile assault by spending +2 MPs and the cost of terrain to enter the hex of the defending unit(s). Other non-mechanized units can only move one hex. Back-to-back mobile assault can be performed by the Germans, usually having movement allowance of six, as long as they have sufficient MPs left. The Soviet mechanized units, on the other hand, have only five movement allowance and so they cannot mobile the Germans twice. The mobile assault rules sounds familiar to that of Ty Bomba in the 90's. Mark's one is a bit more sophisticated I think. When the Soviet player can find the weak spots of the Germans, outflanking them after piercing through the defense, and if he can play well the extended movement and mobile assault rules, the Germans would have faced the imminent danger of being enveloped in the center around the city of Kharkov. To the German player, when to fall back and how to perform reaction movement are the essential tests that the player should go through in order to survive. As a German player, I was in despair from time to time.

Zone of bonding rules over the steppes of Ukraine.  I am always skeptical about this bonding rules at first, i.e. units exerting control over a zone with another friendly units.  It is about firing and defensive area coverage of the units represented in the game.  Sounds right on the theoratical side, but not so easy to execute when play.  It requires you more time to get used to it.  The extensive designer notes, developer notes and advice on tactics given in the rulebook helped and eased the players into the gameplay.     

Ukraine '43 is a long game, with 21 turns to complete a campaign. There are four scenarios to examine segments and different stages of war though. Winning the scenario is mainly by capture of victory cities. There are quite a number of stacks to move and combat. Some players may become weary after completing two turns or so, most likely due to the heavy casualties rules and the burden on the Soviet attack like hitting on a wall in the beginning. Ukraine '43, while lacking the streamlined feel of Mark's later design philosophy, works solidly with Mark's trade marked ZOC bond, mingling with Ty's on-hex mobile assaults. The game achieves what it sets out to do by recreating the entire campaign in one box - a panorama view of it. There are many strategies and tactics to enjoy and to master. I will play it over the Vassal and study it solitaire at home. After so many CDGs or some mindless solitaire SoS games, unsuspectingly I retraced what a real, genuine wargame means in Ukraine'43. It still shines sublimely in gameplay after thirteen years when it first came out. I recommend Ukraine' 43 to all eastern front wargamer and look no further for campaign game in Ukraine theatre-of-operations.

Decent operational game using Simonitch's usual concepts. Easy to get into, decent history, good looks.  Playing it again in the 2nd edition, it is amazing how staid it feels compared to the exuberant creativity visible in the earlier games like The Legend Begins.  Pretty standard odds gaming, little that lights my fire.  What it did keep from TLB are its worst part: the terrain-based victory conditions.  Seeing victory grasped repeatedly by the Germans by cramming units into a nearly surrounded city to delay its fall by a turn is just weird.

Great game. I love the ZoC bonds concept and the situation is perfectly apt to showcase that concept. While  until the frontline is maintained the battle is an attrition slugfest when the line is broken the game changes  completely. It's very rare to find a game system capable to both show a static and  a fluid battle with the same ruleset.

Exciting game that gives both the Soviet and German players the opportunity to attack. Sudden death victory conditions provide a level of competitive tension lacking in the usual wargame. 

Part of a loose series, a little annoying that each game (France 40, Normandy 44, Holland 44, etc) have slight differences to core rules systems, makes it hard to quickly jump from one game to the next.  In fairness the games aren't advertised as a series.  A little bit too chromy.

I really wish this weren't too big for my table.  It's awesome on VASSAL, but I'd really like to play the cardboard version.

Great and tense fun.  The Soviets have overwhelming numbers, but the Germans still have very powerful fire brigades, er, Panzer divisions to race about and try to control the damage.  As a result, both sides get to attack and be terrified in turn.  The German has a difficult time knowing when it's time to withdraw to the next defense line.  Great stuff.

This is my favorite operational WWII gaming system.  The system has several innovations that are not just "chrome", but really convey the interplay between real units that weren't constrained by U-go-I-go in real life.   For example, a group of surrounded units, could conduct a "disengagement" instead of combat.  If the pocket hasn't completely closed, the defenders have a chance to squeak-through before the door closes; but it is not guaranteed....think Falaise.  Also, surrounded units aren't necessarily dead.  They can often fight on for some turns.  Units can also conduct read-guard actions, sacrificing steps to either not retreat at all, or shorten the length of retreat.  And there are many more innovations.  But the brilliant part is that the rules are only 20 pages long and quite easy to understand and use.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The more I play this game the less I like it. The combat system overly favors the attack: if a tank army faces a panzerkorps, each one can attack the other at 4/1 odds due to shifts, so you have to attack first. So you hide your good units behind weak infantry units, which feels very artificial. I understand that a game where defense is weak and attack all-powerful might be more fun (that's the premise of SCS as well), but it does feel strange. Also the magnitude rule may have sounded like a good idea, but unfortunately it gives an incentive to defend with less than 3 steps per hex : defending a key hex with 4 steps or more is usually a big mistake for the Germans as it will kill them faster. I sold my copy in 2006.

In terms of gameplay, low counter density and rigid ZOC bonds make this game a bit chess-like. You need to plan carefully and pay attention to detail to avoid catastrophes, particularly the German player. The game is well developed and well designed, almost errata free, very competitive and tense, with the "Sudden Death" rules. Both sides have offensive opportunities.

Tentative rating after a gaming session of 6 turns…

We are in 1943, right after Kursk: The Germans are not completely overwhelmed, but the Soviets have the upper edge: There are definitely too many Soviets for the Germans to win the war… Especially when they have 4 RP Points (2 INF and 2 Tanks) per turn (except for the first one) versus one RP per turn for the Germans! We are in the middle of a war of attrition and the game shows well HOW the war on the Eastern Front was complete, utter madness! 

…But, victory for the Soviets at the end of the campaign is FAR from automatic and that makes Ukraine ’43 a very tense game for both sides!  

The game system seems pretty robust and has the right level of complexity for me.

It is quite difficult to maneuver and reorient your defense or attack: 3/4 MP (Soviet/German) for INF and only 5/6 MP for Tanks/Panzers! When you need +2 MP to leave an EZOC, that’s not much! Advances after combat are critical, and there are TWO rounds of combat per turn! [Hopefully for the Germans, the number of combats in the second round is limited!] The Extended Movement rule helps a bit, but has important (and logical) restrictions… 

Combat Magnitude may be a problem, though: The Germans gain little benefits from defending with more than three steps outside well protected hexes - in fortifications and behind rivers, for instance. Zhukov, coupled with two Tank Armies is a deadly weapon! [Well he is very dangerous for the Soviets too… But, with their Replacement points, they can afford it - contrarily to the Germans!]

One of the most accurate model of a Soviet offensive : the pace of the breakthroughs, the way the front is shaped, the planning required, (you need to plan one turn or two ahead for the allocation of reinforcements, artillery etc) the interactions between the different fronts and how they can launch staggered attacks in succession, it all feels very realistic.

One of the best games I ever played. Perfectly balanced, any one can win. Great graphics and as usual, superb map by Mark Simonitch. Difficult to find do not hesitate trying to get a copy, it is worth every cent you invest on it. The best inside the system is the sequence of play in which two combat phases are possible. I rank it 10 because it is a perfect design.

11 out of 10 for second edition.  Smooth play.  The best representation of 20th Century operational art I've ever come across.  Accomplishes what more complex/complicated games of similar genre attempt to do with a fraction of the rules overhead.  My new favorite war game (tied with Normandy '44).  Simonitch is my favorite war game designer.

Perhaps my favorite (so far) on this subject but I also like the MiH T3 games, too. The 2nd edition is a completely different game from 1st ed. I prefer 1st ed but 2nd is not too bad.

just played for the second time: this game is definitely a great game. 

The situation is really stressfull for both players. Russian armies must conquer ground and avoid to be late. German is forced to resist and avoid loosing the game too early.

With his panzercorps, the german can be very dangerous if they can concentrate at least two of them. Russian armies have to attack on a broad front to avoid this. He must not hesitate to change his attack axis to keep going on.

[1st edition comments, 2009] This is the sort of game I don't have much interest or investment in anymore, but it seems a good instance of the WW2-operational genre.  We only got through set up and two turns in five hours, which is more indicative of our leisurely pace than anything that has to do with the game.  My playtime for three-unit-stack-exploitation-phase "classic" SPI-style games, regardless of how innovatively chromed, is so infrequent these days that I find playing them to be a bit tedious and certainly more time-consuming.  All to say that while Ukraine '43 certainly seems to be good at what it does, I'm just not that into it.

Definitely playable; a few quirks make it more challenging to learn, but well worth it.

The emergency supply rules are extremely forgiving, which is odd because historically the Soviets were significantly rail-bound, even with the supply trucks provided through Lend-Lease. With the ZOC bond rules, it takes some getting use to for the Axis to form an orderly retreat without being caught at the last minute.

This is a decent, if unspectacular wargame. For a much better game on the same subject, see [b]A Victory Lost[/b].

When I first played I thought it was probably one of the best East Front sims I had experienced. Still think this is the case but can be spoilt (as can most games) when one starts to manipulate the game mechanics. The tactic of hiding the Soviet Tank/Shock armies after intial breakthroughs behind infantry screens seems artificial - so I don't bother and watch them get mauled in the hope that the German player will get greedy and not protect his own Panzer Corps!

Rating based on only 5 sessions, so it might be altered in the future.  Extremely interesting topic, graphical style is just the usual GMT housestyle, but that isn't a bad thing of course.  Gaming system seems to work fine, and it's fun to have the Russians attacking for a change!

RATING: 9
A very fine game - Tense and well balanced. The game provides a real feel of the Germans walking a tightrope in terms of holding the line (because Hitler says so) making precision counter attacks to restore the line and maing essential tactical withdrawels. Meanwhile the Russians try and bulldozer their way through. The rules are reasonable complex but well put together with very good player aids. If you are a fan of WWII Eastern Front this is a must buy

pre-ordered from GMT. Always wanted a game on the epic battles on the eastern front in 1943. The new edition is said to be played faster.

RATING: 7
Nicely written rules & rare enough to be signaled : almost errata free.
Nice design : magnitude, use of special units for column shifts...
Russian turns are very long compared to german ones & PBEM may be complicated to check your opponent's moves.
Nice game however.

I st edition. Been gaming for 30 years, and this is one of my all time favorites. ZOC Bonds are innovative and add realism to the game. Other games can bog down in locking ZOCs and weight the game down. The games rewards mobility, aggressiveness. Each sides and capabilities and vulnerabilities are clear. Although not too complicated it is relatively difficult to remember all the intricacies. But even with that IT IS FUN AND TENSE, just like a WW II East Front game should be. The German player has to be fast and decisive. The Russian player must be deliberate and flexible (to a point). Special rules like emergency supply, security divisions activation, leaders, STAVKA artillery divisions etc. add realism. Great game.

Too much system for my tastes. Also really dislike standard sized maps that have a sliver of an additional map section to add to it. Still, has to be considered the best historical game on the subject, and the 2nd ed. is reported to have streamlined the rules.

Based on a read-through of the rules.  Looks like a nice system and good coverage of the offensive.  Not sure if I'll get the time to solo this one through for a while.

I love the theme and the system, yet I don't enjoy the gameplay so much. It's a very thought going for the Soviets. The German panzer and mobile divisions are too strong, which is affecting the balance.

Will get to this, looks like Manstein's backhand blow that sent the Soviets reeling... ZOC rules feature "bonds" which is an improvement over traditional zones of control.

The verdict on this title is still out for me. I am interested in the subject but even after a couple plays, I'm not comfortable with the rules. It takes a notch up though after I learned some of the awkward rules in Ardennes '44, and found them effective in giving a better feel to the tactical/operational feel of the battle. The same feeling is seeping into play for this title, but I can't qualify it quite right yet.

2nd Edition. Smooth play. The system works fine for this campaign. It is interesting to compare this to A Lost Victory. Two similar situations, with vastly different mechanics for gameplay. I like both actually, even if this one is far less chaotic. The gameplay in Ukraine 43 is more traditional. In effect the Germans can create havoc, but usually in only one place at a time. The disengagement rules are vital for the Germans to survive at all.

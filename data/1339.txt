RATING: 3
Archaic.  Eg: "Roll 1d6 and lose that number of turns" -  thankfully absent in more modern games.  No nostalgia factor for me = low rating - I strongly suspect that I might have a similar reaction to Talisman had I not played it when younger.

Since I could never find anyone to play D&D with growing up, this was the next best thing.  Light, simple, and fun design.

RATING: 8
What a great kids game! Lots of decision making, lots of randomness, super simple rules, not too long, and there is always the wizard class for people who want a bit more strategy. The cardboard character pieces are terrible, though. Too bad the spaces are too small for regular D&D figs. Also, too bad the cards don't fit into the rooms; looking up the number counters to see what's in a revealed room is annoying.

Low rated, but still one of my favorite games of all time.  It was my favorite as a kid, and has been my sons favorite since he started playing it at 4.  About as much strategy as Candy Land, but it's Dungeon! and I will refuse to accept anything bad about it.

It's light on the decision making turn to turn, but the meta-decisions (what character to play, how deep in the dungeon to go, etc.) help make this fun and engaging anyway.  This version has good quality components at a good price.  A game you can play kids and adults together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Okay, it's not a great game, but it was a great board-game version of Dungeons of Dragons (at least when I was in 3rd grade).  I played a bit with my youngest sister many years ago, and she really enjoyed it as well.  It's easy to find flaws (luck-based, repetitive gameplay, etc...), but it's still much more innovative than most children's games (non-linear board, character advancement, etc.).  Games like Arkham Horror owe a bit of debt to Dungeon, I think.

What was up with the Dungeon dice -- as I recall, pale blue with a numeric digit (not pips).  And it was almost unreadable -- you had to rub the die with a white crayon just to read the results.

12th Board Game I bought :D Was in Akihabara and found a hobby shop that sells board games; decided to buy one out of whim :P Game kinda feels like a fantasy themed Monopoly and Incan Gold.

Yeah, some of that is a nostalgia rating -- in junior high we played this a LOT. I admit, the game has problems, especially the early version we have which has some fairly vague rules. Still, it's a blast to play, and I'm always up for it.

Hotdogs: !?!
+1 damage

Own both the 1975 original and the latest printing, and soon probably some of the others in between. Friends and I really love this, a lot due to nostalgia but it also plays rather well despite its simplicity. Sure, this dungeon crawl style has been done a million times now, with more theme and complexity, and nothing beats D&D itself, but we will occasionally bust this out and enjoy ourselves. I would also say this was one of the most influential board games of all...

Spent a lot of time in high school playing this with my friends.  There wasn't a lot of strategy but it was a lot of fun.  The favorite phrase used was, "Retreat two, drop prize, lose turn!"  It was echoed a lot, during the game.  (10/16/07 thift find)

I have the 1981 edition of this Gygax classic, and it provides a great Dungeon crawling experience to this day! It's a fantastic gateway into more complex games like the Dungeons and Dragons Adventure Series games (Castle Ravenloft, etc.) and will engage younger and older players alike. Lots of little cardboard bits, so make sure you know what's supposed to be in the box before you purchase a used copy.

I gave this to my 7 year old son for Christmas and I am glad I did. It is a lot of fun. He loves it and I love playing it with him. He one our first game, fair and square. He chose a character that should have been delving into the higher level rooms. I chose the lowest level character. I lost because he stuck around and cleared out all the easy stuff first and I was left with just hoping for really lucky rolls against the nastier monsters. Fun game. I would play it any time with my kids.

March into an underground lair filled with creatures who would gladly leave you alone if you'd only return the favor, kill them via a tedious and arbitrary combat mechanic, and take their treasure, the majority of which is useless save as a status symbol to lord over your rivals.  The game itself provides a brilliant meta-commentary on its own themes, as the recent re-issue represents nothing more than a fresh coat of paint slapped onto a 35-year-old property that steadfastly refuses to even acknowledge, let alone learn from, the decades of growth and innovation dungeon-crawler board games have enjoyed since its youth.

As a critique of the fundamental hollowness of mindless consumerism, it's genius!  As a game, it's ass.

(KIDS) I played this a bunch as a kid and my son just received it for his 5th birthday.  I have to admit that the game is actually a bit better than I remember it.  There are some choices to make.  It is a game of almost all luck, and just rolling dice to see if you win or not.  But, the theme can draw you in and it fits well for smaller kids.

After four plays with my son, I have to say that I am enjoying this game more than I should be.  I don't love it, but when I compare it to other games I've rated with a 5, Dungeon! is definitely better... So, it gets a 6.

Fun game to play for family game night with kids. Biggest disappointment is the basic nature of pawns. Cardboard cutouts that tend to have the bases fall off of when moving just was irritating. Definitely needs higher quality pawns. Also tends to be very unbalanced with regards to monster strength but still enjoyable to play for a quick few games.

The rating is a personal comment and not relative to how much I would recommend this title for kids/family/nostalgia.

Great fun to be had...when you take it for what it is.
Don't overplay it, don't overthink it.
Turn your brain off...maybe have a drink, enjoy...

Also great for/with kids.  I played it with my 4 year old, and she loved it.  Great gateway into dungeon crawl, or RPG, or tactical games and thinking.  She wants to play again.

Consider the price point, and that my kid loves it, win-win and worth the money.

YMMV.  :-)

Played a couple times long years ago. At the time, I preferred RPGs to this-- even though I played board games, too. Presentation was excellent for 1975, but would not compete in today's world of plastic miniatures and clever combat systems.

Bought in early 2014 from Amazon and kind of forgot it on the shelf as it looked too simple.  Broke it out on a trip to Grand Isle and enjoyed it with the kids.  It's quite simple.  My only major complaint is the lack of powerup ability, which makes some of the monsters VERY difficult.  Often you need to roll a 10 or better on 2d6.  Update 2017: No plays in a while, so might sell.

Its unbalanced. Its almost entirely luck based. And it is utterly brilliant. Its a bargain and the kids love it. When my 5 year old daughter defeats a monster and gets the treasure there is all joy on her face. She loves it.

RATING: 2
Brother-in-law owns this, and it's awful. It's essentially all random. I expected you would get equipment and progress your characters, at least a little. To me, it's just as bad as Chutes and Ladders- entirely random, and while you can choose where to go, you're just as likely to roll badly against a weak monster as you are against a strong one, and the result will be same. If you end up losing the roll and drop a treasure, it basically becomes 'stand there and roll until you win, and pick everything back up, or die'. And if you die, you simply get a new character, and go back to do it again- truly a lousy game, and I don't feel like it'd even be worth getting for kids to learn board gaming. Besides managing one's own frustration, and maybe comparing which number is higher, it's not teaching anything useful. There's just nothing here!

I'm using this game to get my 10yr old son into D&D. Simple game but lots of fun. Very well priced. Do recommend for any dungeon fan.

Needs a large area to play. Monster and treasure cards a bit small but I will be making a card holder for them.

Uses cardboard tokens for characters but obviously to keep the price down. Will be replacing them with miniature models but this will cost more than what the game did.

It's not a terrible game, and there are some decisions to be made right from the start, including what type of character to play and which path (and therefore what risks) to take. But ultimately, it comes down to rolling the dice and looking up the result. One of (if not the) most successful strategies seems to be for stronger characters to clear out the easier rooms to force the weaker characters deeper into the dungeon than they ought to go, then to stalk one of those weaker characters with the idea of stealing all the treasure that gets left behind when (not if) he eventually gets wounded or killed. As with the old PC game Wizardry, I don't understand the idea behind a player getting teleported to the surface for being killed (or here, even if only wounded). The weaker character types only really have a chance in a fast two (or maybe three) player game where there's probably enough treasure on the first two levels for someone to reach the goal and escape alive, and such a game seems like little more than a race.

Decent old-fashioned family type game, with D&D theming.  Less jokes but more fun than Munchkin.  Playing the latest edition more recently underlined the excessive randomness (and length, for what it is), but it's not completely without charm - though I think I preferred the previous edition.

This is actually a pretty good game, regardless of your age...there is a definite strategy to the board game, and it apes the whole D&D thing. My brother and I played the hell out of this as kids, and when my wife and I babysit our friends' kids, they want to play this old, battered game as much as anything! It was after getting this game and watching the animated "The Hobbit" as a child, I tumbled down the rabbit hole into the world of RPGs and D&D.

I'm having a blast playing this with my son. However, I think there are plenty of missed opportunities in this production. They should have included miniatures instead of cardboard characters, more special treasure cards (boots of speed, magic shield, powerful one use items) and more traps and weapons. 

I've made a card expansion and printed it at arts cow. I call it "The Wandering Merchant" and the idea is to place a merchant minature in one of the chambers. The players can visit the merchant and trade items for randomly drawn equipment from merchant´s deck. I also switched the cardboard characters for pathfinder hero miniatures.

I have to give this a decent score. It is a game which my 9 year old daughter loves and constantly asks for. It is very simple and easy to learn and a great game for the beginner.

We are "using" this game as a stepping stone to the next level of dungeon crawls (Talisman etc.)

Roll the dice, add the modifier = fight the monster :)

Easy and fun

This is the perfect introduction to D&D and RPGs. It is such a classic. So primitive and simple, yet you can see the roots of D&D in it.

It is well balanced and fun for winners and losers. For me, it is a wonderful "full-circle" event playing D&D-esque with my kids, even while they're young.

Highly recommend you scrounge or borrow a copy.

Totally faithful to the D&D universe and made me even moreso want to play D&D.

It's a dungeon adventure that's "their flavor".

Purchased for nostalgia reasons. That's pretty much the only reason to get it. Roll and move dungeon exploration. Race to get a pre-determined amount of gold before the other players.

The game that started it all for me. The roots of fantasy and D&D were sown within my very soul the first time I picked this game up at 7years of age. I didnt even know how to play it until I was nine. Man was it cool. I mean now you go back and play it, and it is seriously flawed and not all that enteraining. But wow finally beating the purple worm or the black pudding, that was priceless. That and the sweet gems and gold. Visually it really had something going for it, despite the garrish colors.

I loved this as a kid, but it seems so simple now compared to other games in this genre that are out there.  In retrospect, I'm not so sure all the player types are balanced.  I'm surprised this hasn't been revamped and re-released.  If it was, I'm sure I'd pick it up, again.

RATING: 4
I haven't had a chance to play this game with other people.  And to be completely honest, I'm not sure if I'm going to.  I bought this game because it was very inexpensive and I thought, "oh, it's like Dungeons & Dragons!"  This game has very little substance and I feel like it's really not that great.  Maybe it's because I own and have played games that this game aspires to be but falls very short of.

I will say that Dungeon! is easy to learn and the mechanics of the game are really simple.  Maybe this would be a good start for younger players, but I find that it's really not something that I would personally play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game should really only be played with children as all you do is walk from room to room and roll the dice to defeat monsters.  Sure there is a small bit of strategy but not enough to keep this game interesting.  But for the price it can actually be a great childrens game.

After countless nights of chutes and ladders and Princess Candyland, I asked my three year old daughter if she would like to play Dungeon.
She understands colors and recognizes numbers up to 8, so it is easy for her to look at the monster card, find her color and read the number required.  She can count past twelve so counting the dots on the dice is no problem.  She was grumpy with the rule about no treasure in the "big rooms" but with a few games under her belt, she regularly states the rule "no treasure in big rooms" whenever she enters them.

Sure she doesn't understand the value of the different treasures and doesn't know how many sacks of gold she needs to win, so we cut some corners on some of the rules and make sure she doesn't do anything too detrimental.

Well last three nights Dungeon has been requested so we will see how long I can go before boredom sets in.

This was one of those games that I used to rush home from school to play. My friend up the street owned it and it was a nice way to satisfy the D&D fix within a  hort period of time and without fighting over who would be DM. Loved this Game. Never palyed the updated versions, but am now curious.

If I think back to when I was like 12, I pretty much agree with R. Martin's assessment of the game, in his review below.

RATING: 6.5
This game is okay.  It gets the feel right for a kick the door down, kill all the monsters, and take their stuff kind of game.  However, it is too reliant on luck.  With mediocre luck you will rapidly get frustrated as the monsters kill you and steal your stuff instead.  Also, poor draws on the dungeon deck can see you facing fairly difficult monsters while you're competitors get easy monsters.  Then you draw from the treasure deck, again, the quality of treasure is very luck dependent.  The only influence the player has on the game is which character to play and where to go on the board (which determines the difficulty of the monster deck and the quality of the treasure deck).  I enjoy some randomness in a game, but I also like to have a little more influence on the game.  Also, the solo component gets old fairly quickly.

On the bright side, it's simple enough that you don't have to pay full attention while playing it.  And it can be fun if all you want is a random little dice roller.

Around 1000 games later I can say this is the game that got me into gaming.  Rather sad, really, when an unsuspecting 9 year old sat down to play with his uncle.  You wander through a 6 level dungeon battling monsters with dice and extracting treasure.  You scream "ambush" if somebody attackable walks past, and so on.  Rated up a notch purely for nostalgia. :)

Still a fun little game with a quaint charm. The 1981 edition has wonderfully goofy illustrations. If you find value in old-school D&D style you'll probably love this one. Would probably benefit from the addition of some nice old school minis (Grenadier, perhaps) to replace the included generic pawns. 

On a side note, the dice included, like the 1981 Basic D&D set, had unpainted numbers. They gave you a little grease pencil to color in the numbers. 

First played and bought in 2012.

It's pretty much the same as you remember it, but with the addition of modern, polished artwork (for better or for worse) and a couple rules tweaks here and there. 

Don't expect some huge, deeply nuanced dungeon crawl, but if you still have a child lurking in your soul somewhere you can have some great fun with this game. 

It's also very modestly priced at $20.

Fun game for playing with the kids. I have fond memories of playing this from my own childhood. Has it stood the test of time? Well... it's pretty much exactly how I remember it, but with updated artwork. I lowered my score half a point due to the new edition's tendency to stray from the tried and true D&D lore. For example, why is it harder for the cleric to defeat a zombie? Isn't that what clerics are for in D&D - turning undead? And why is the zombie a level 3 monster while the ghoul is level 2? And a level 1 minotaur? Granted, only an ex-D&D dork would be bothered by such things.

I almost gave up hope until it magically appeared on my 10th birthday.  Needless to say I was happy as a pig in...excrement.

While nostalgia tinted lenses have a lot to do with it, I found this game as a good reference point as far as adventure board games are concerned. I often think back on it and I believe it may have a lot to do with my love for RPG/Adventure video game titles too (as far as I'm concerned Adventure encompasses more than point & click). 

I used to own this game some 25+ years ago, and had many great afternoons with it. The fact that you have many ways of tackling it game it a strong replay value, still you could go a little off script and interfere with others in creative ways. 

Should you encounter it, I hope it brings as much joy to you as it did to me.

Crack.  That's what this was.  First one free.  This is the game that got me back back into board games.  Bought it for my daughter, but then starting looking for other, more complex games...and got into Talisman...and that led me to Lord of the Rings LCG...and that led me to Thunderstone Advanced...and then I started Kickstarting ... and now there's Zombicide: Black Plague and Runebound...and Eldritch Horror is lurking on the horizon with its grasping tentacles. Noooooooooo!

Um....now have bought much of Arkham Horror (both board and card games) instead of Eldritch, and kickstarted 4 games.  Where does this end?

Pre-Ordered the new version due out October 12, 2012
Update: it's simple, doesn't take a helluva long time, and accessible to my little girl.  She enjoys it and I enjoy playing something with her that we can come up with a story about dungeon delving together (I'll play a pseudo-DM roll to give the game some depth for her).  It's still Dungeon which may be a turn off for some, but I love it.

RATING: 6
This was one of the first games I ever played and enjoyed it a lot.  I last played it with all my gaming friends back in 1978 and then I played it again with a different group in 1981.  A lot of fun.  I had a chance to play it again in 1999 and realized there is a huge flaw with the game.  Too easy to get a "lose a turn" result.  Most of the people playing the game hated it because of this and I had a hard time playing.  I think it would be an easy fix.  Overall, I would rate the game an "8" for its basic design and concept, but I only rate it as a "6" for its combat result table.  Game play tends to drag.  However, it is a well done game and for its time, very clever. I'd like to play a later version as both my copies are the 1975 and the next version, which is 1979?  Not sure what changes were made with the later version.  

I did get to play a later TSR version many years ago, but the only difference I saw was the card size was smaller.  Other than that, it seemed to be the same game.

Brings back fond memories of late night gaming with my friends.

This is a game for 7-10 year old boys.

The strategy seems to be the wizard, but then stay in the 1-3 area picking up loot so that the lower class characters can't possibly win since they will fail miserably in the higher level areas.

There is a big discrepancy between the level and the range of hit points needed, as well the the loot.  Some levels have loot that you can also get a few levels below.  If I was successful and got a 2000 value treasurer in level 5 that I can also get in level 3 I'd be PO'd.

There needs to be a few more ways to buff your stats, or a better system for handling damage.

I picked up a 1975 version, overcome by a fit of nostalgia as I had owned the 1980's version as a kid and from teh comments in the forum on the better game play when you can put the cards in the rooms (plus I hated the fiddly number chits).  It was a bit of a surprise -- the rules were quite a bit different from the ones I remember, and the consequences of the monster attack table were more brutal, plus the additional rules for wandering monsters and ambushing other players.  We really enjoy it, although I do miss the board and card artwork from the 1980's version.

A classic that's good for introducing kids to the fantasy adventure genre.

The kids are kind of lukewarm on this title. But, when they play Talisman and Runebound, games this simple in this genre just don't measure up.

But, you can't beat the price of this for some easy dungeon-delving.

Nostalgic rating for a game that actually holds up very very well as a gateway game for younger players. Probably one of my first non-mainsteam board games growing up.  One of the first dungeon crawlers that was a gateway game for the original Dungeons and Dragons RPG.  Players are characters roaming an underground dungeon, fighting nasties, collecting treasure and items.  Straight forward fun.  Got two of these on Ebay cos they were so cheap just to avenge the loss of my original to a move.

The most fun I had playing this game was when we had a big bag of rubber bands and took turns seeing who could put the most rubber bands around their head/face.  So I guess you should just get a big bag of rubber bands instead.

UPDATE:  The comment above is the last time I played this as an adult, with adults, somewhere in the early '90s.  As a kid I played the hell out of this... until the cards were as soft as li'l baby blankets & the box was destroyed.  Fast-forward to 2010 when I loaned that once-much-loved game out to a friend with two small daughters interested in fantasy home invasion.  It was a HUGE hit, firing those young imaginations and setting them on a trajectory that will surely end up somewhere in [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] proper.  As it should be.

So if you ask li'l me & the two Battle-Princesses it gets a super-solid [b]11!![/b].  The 5 is sans kids.

Move, kick down the door, kill the monster, take their gold.  Move, kick down the door, get killed by the monster, go back to the beginning and do it again... This game is very easy to learn and is a basic dungeon crawl.  Great game for young kids but man, a night of bad rolling can set you back an hour.  Otherwise, games are fairly quick and it has some good elements of back-stabbery if you have some clever players.  I like it.  I and the family have played several times and it is always well received.

Dungeon is by no means a complicated game. It essentially boils down to having lucky rolls against enemies in a race to beat your opponents out the door with the most treasure. That being said, there is some light strategy involved. Do you press your luck and venture deeper into the dungeon for more valuable treasure? Or, do you clean out the lesser levels where the easier monsters can be found, but the treasure isn't as valuable? The different classes afford varying degrees of difficulty. All in all, it's a perfectly reasonable and straightforward family game.

How can you NOT love Dungeon?  The little RIP grave marker chits?  I mean, come on?  For me, it ALL goes back to Dungeon; I grew up on this game, thanks to my D&amp;D playing older brother.  This was my Candy Land, my Shoots &amp; Ladders.

Family game and rated for that. Played a lot with family and kids...just don't expect too much. Push your luck plays a big part. Original version VERY unbalanced in character strengths. Do not know if balance was corrected in later versions.  Play the Elf for a major handicap vs the kids.

Bought as a Basic D&D player, perhaps with an unformed thought of finding a gateway game for others into this amazing RPG world I'd found. Though it's lack of depth and inflexibility proved dull, it did inspire juvenile authoring of similar D&D-lite games (still WIP!). And if without it, via a tortuous chain, games like Dungeon Lords wouldn't exist, it can keep a place in our hearts.

Initial Rating 5.5 (April 2014)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game, but it (somewhat) surprised me. It can be a fun game but this is very group dependent. Also the game is dead simple, you can explain it under 3 minutes. Love the theme BUT I didn’t feel it very much in our games. Also, I’m not sure the characters are very well balanced but in this kind of game (lots of uncontrollable luck) I don’t really care. Perhaps I prefer to play Talisman or Dungeonquest but Dungeon! fills another niche, perhaps it is a family game to play with children. I think the game is best played with  to 4 to 6 players, with more it can drag, with less it won’t be fun.

The art is cool, but the cards are very small and hard to sleeves due to their non-standard size.

Bottom line, I will play again if requested, perhaps I will request it if I’m in the mood but for now I’m selling my copy of the game. 

Current Rating: 5.5

Bought the "reboot" based on being a huge fan as a kid. Very happy with the build and quality. I wish the chits had been retired, as my original set allowed you to leave the monster and treasure cards on the rooms they belonged to on the actual game board rather than removing them to the side. It was an easy change that didn't stick in the reboot. Still love the game and glad to see it on the shelves!

This is the godfather game of RUNEBOUND & DESCENT--no doubt about it.  My early 80s AD&D group used to play this on saturday nights when we didn't feel like creating characters or nobody wanted to DM a session.  It was fun then but I'm sure it's lacking now.  A classic in the era of the TSR Golden Age.  If you have kids, I'm sure it'd be more fun to play this with them than CANDYLAND or SHOOTS & LADDERS.

Random dice-fest. No strategy. Players can lose 1-2 turns in a row. You can lose half your treasure (or essentially half your points) with a bad roll. Too long for what it is. But I think kids might enjoy it. Would be willing to play with my son.

RATING: 2
I believe the only people that will really enjoy this game are those who are buying it for the nostalgia factor of having played it as a kid themselves.  I did not and therefore I see it for the atrocious game that it is.  Components-wise the board is beautiful but the cards are awfully small, far smaller than those small euro or FFG half-sized cards so even our son had trouble as the art is half that tiny card.  It is a really tedious game and since we have so many better games even our son didn't really enjoy it much.  For the youngest of children Mice & Mystics is a far better option though admittedly its hard to beat the low price of Dungeon! 

REPLACED BY: Mice & Mystics, Dungeons & Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil, and Claustrophobia.

Bought the 80's version of this game. Loved it. Would play it very often. I even wrote up "expert" rules for it that allowed for character creation and experience. Characters would not live past 2-3 plays of the game though. Sooner or later that double 2 would show up and the character would die. 

This is a great game to play with the kids. Gives them the thematic experience and good for making them count up treasure. Starts them off with learning about some strategy. Don't need to go to level 5/6 creatures if the amount you need to win can be gotten on level 3/4 much easier.  

This is a game if someone suggests playing I am always good for.  Fast and easy play and easy to get into without reading a booklet of instructions. Anyone expecting a deep life enriching experience and can't appreciate this game for what it is should look elsewhere. If you fancy yourself a gaming aficionado and are kind of snobbish about your games do yourself a favor and don't play this. Unless you just like leaving bad reviews and trying to make yourself sound mature about a game that is suggested for ages 8+.

Instead of rolling and moving Dungeon! blows you away by shaking up the tired old trend and has you move first and then roll! Unfortunately that is about 100% of the game. In fact there are only two possibilities: Move-Roll-Pass or Move-Roll-Fail-Bad to very bad result ensues. Repeat this with the additional fuss of constantly shuffling undefeated monster tokens and the treasures they steal and eventually the most skilled die roller wins. Great for young kids but unfortunately this isn't one of those games intended for kids that still plays well with an older crowd.

Played this a lot with the burrito boy when he was 5, but now that he's 6, we haven't played for a while.  [i]I have earned the right[/i] to rate this a 4.  Man I'm tired of playing this.

On the plus side, this game was the way the burrito boy was introduced to adding multiple-digit numbers, so that's cool.  

Note that the rules available from BGG are newer (and much better) than the ones which came in my box, so if you're going to suffer, you might as well suffer with more coherent rules.

Update: and now that Hellhammer is 4 1/2, this is hitting the table again... she's just starting to read, so she can sound out the monster names, and find "Superhero" on the cards...  How long until she can play Descent, I wonder.

This might deserve more points if rated as a children's game, but I'm not the best to judge.  It's fun to go around killing monsters in the dungeon, and there is more decisions to be made than say, Snakes and Ladders.

As an adult, it's much too reliant on dice, and there aren't a lot of important decisions to make.

I think some variants could potentially spice it up though, (Wandering monsters...that sort of thing).

My love of this game goes back to my D&D sessions back in the 70's and 80's. When the group split up we tended to play this in our "Time out"'s  Its mechanism may seem simple by todays standards, but it was fun, it had hack and slay and oodles of treasure - if you could get it out before your mates attacked you and the monsters were echoes of the D&D monsters of the early days.

RATING: 6
Easy to win as Wizard (in my opinion). Good kids game. 

In many ways Dungeon! is similar to Dungeons & Dragons, although much simplified and transformed into a board game. Players explore a dungeon that is divided into levels of increasing difficulty, fighting monsters for valuable treasure. As players venture deeper into the dungeon, the monsters become more difficult and the treasure more valuable. Several character classes each have slightly different fighting abilities – most notably the wizard, who can cast spells. Combat is simulated using dice; players roll the dice to attack a monster, and if unsuccessful, the dice are rolled to determine the effect of the monster's counter-attack.The winner is the first player to bring a certain amount of treasure back to the Dungeon's entrance

Another classic, but I don't enjoy the game today. It is all random dice rolling and arbitrarily getting sent back to the start. There is little you can do to influence the outcome of an encounter, except the choice in what level you want. The game gets worse with high player counts, because all the encounters get taken and you have no choice but to repeatedly die to a more difficult encounter, or make very little progress at a time with the lower level encounters.

A very suave-looking, affordable reboot of the prehistoric TSR dungeon-crawling game for 'seventies folks who found D&D too demanding but wanted in on the fun. There's nothing here to astound even a moderately experienced gamer, but it's good for kids, and the one thing that elevates it to a league above Parker Brothers dicefests is the tactical trickiness of trying to chose dungeon level appropriate to your character, depending on both your overall strength and how you're doing in the game.

Not a bad game, but difficult to justify coming back to when I can play other dungeon crawls with more meat on them.  Game-play lasts only about 30-45 min, but setup can take nearly 10 min, almost too long for the length of the game.

When in the mood for a short taste of a fantasy adventure, this does an okay job.  Then again, I'd probably rather pull out Key To The Kingdom or Labyrinth.

Hmm, I think this game is underrated! Sure, it's a massive luckfest. But it's FUN! The turns play out so quickly that there's little downtime. You get to chuck dice, kill monsters, and loot their treasures. You get to search for secret doors and laugh as you swipe the treasures your fellow adventurer dropped. 

Dungeon! is fantasy dungeon crawling stripped to its barest essence. And that is a Good Thing. 

Also, this game cost me fourteen dollars. FOURTEEN DOLLARS!

I have the 1975 edition with the purple box and the huge map with lovely big squares for the treasure and monster cards.  I dislike intensely the reprint.  This is a great game for kids, and if you add in the player attack rules, for backstabbing adults.  5-10 minutes to set up, about 15 minutes per person to play.  Endlessly customizable - I have 12 character classes. Combat is simple, map is evocative.

Worthy followup to the classic game. A D&D-lite experience without all the polyhedrals, character sheets, and the like.
Some minis WOULD be nice, as would a bi-fold board, but I don't have any issue with the (heavy) stock the components are printed from. As for the tiny cards, they don't bother me, because they fit neatly into most any small organizer. Or stick some Lego together to make a box.
Consider 35 years' inflation: this game STILL runs about $13. You'll get your money's worth out of it, unless you're an absolute purist who insists on the original version. Have fun buying it; if I want minis, there's a gazillion of them out there for cheap.

Holy crap, Dungeon! is so much fun! I love games that do what they set out to do extremely well, and this one does exactly that. (Whether you enjoy what it sets out to do is a different thing, of course.) It's light, it's quick, and it's random -- but there's a game there. Managing the randomness and luck, and adjusting your strategy to your class, circumstances, and your opponents, provides a great deal of enjoyment.

For $20, this is a great value. They cheaped out on the standees, but at that price point it's hard to grumble. The board is colorful, the tiny cards are a good choice for this game, and it all works well in play,

The first version I got - back in '75.  Purple Box, vinyl map.  We have three versions.  This is the only one I will rate and the only one where I will record plays (if that happens).  The originator of the dungeon crawl - came out soon after D&D.  The kids play this regularly.

Love this one. Great gateway game for teaching your 7 year old sister a game that doesn't totally suck. By far the best game we've played together. It's simple and tailored for her age, and introduces her to a much more thematic and exciting style of game. I actually had a rather fun time playing it myself. I wouldn't be opposed to playing it with a non kid..however that's where it shines at, obviously. But boy is this a step up from playing games like Hey That's My Fish, and Sushi Go.

2 / 5 - Fair.

It's a kids' game and rated accordingly. Although the "hunted" solo option is quite a fun way to kill 15-20 minutes if you're so minded. Deserves to be a family classic. Review: http://fortressat.com/articles-boardgame-reviews/3664-dungeon-review

I played a bit of Dungeons and Dragons when I was a teenager.  I enjoyed the adventure of it.  So, when I heard about Dungeon! it peaked my interest.  I liked the idea of playing a very simplified and short game of D&D.

And that's essentially what Dungeon! is.  In the game you choose a character and go exploring in a - you guessed it - dungeon.  While doing this you battle familiar creatures in an attempt to collect a given amount of treasure depending upon the character you've chosen.

All the complexity of D&D is gone.  You don't assign points to various attributes, you don't level up as you gain experience, nothing like that.  The map of the dungeon is divided into 6 levels of increasing difficulty.  Each level has tougher monsters to face than the one before, and of course better treasures to find.  The rule book suggests certain characters stick to certain levels, but players are not obligated to do so.

Overall, Dungeon! is a light easy game to play when you feel like exploring and fighting baddies, but don't want to spend all day doing it, or having to wade through rule books the size of text books.

Good: 
Back when I was a kid, and this game was brand spanking new, we couldn't get enough of it. It has class selection, character progression, and simple monster slaying. If we weren't playing DnD then we would be playing this. My original game board and pieces actually wore out from use so I picked up a reprint when it was released, as memorabilia. 

Bad:
I would still recommend this for young gamers. It has simple rules and roll to move mechanics so its easy to set up and play. However, to us old farts the game doesn't have unique mechanics, is too simple, and there is too much randomness to be entertaining.

Ok - here is a story... i was in grade eight.  A bunch of my friends were playing basketball and it starts pouring.  No, not pouring it starts flash flooding... so we run like hell to the nearest home base - my friends house.  We are soaked and making a mess all over so we decide to take off our shirts and socks and put them in the dryer.  We are all bored so we decide to play a game of Dungeon.  Half way through the game Chris' older brother Martin comes home with a bunch of his friends - he is throwing a party.  We are sitting half naked playing a game of Dungeon.  As soon as everyone walks into the study their is dead silence - I can't imagine what the hell they were thinking????  A whole new meaning to those wierd D&D players...

For its vintage, this game is much more fun than you'd think.  In the expert game, the gold totals for victory conditions seemed a bit generous for the hero/elf players.  We didn't play with the PVP rules that are present with some editions of the game.  After our first play, I would strongly suggest using them; it will create a means to kill the winning player.

Recently been re-released but essentially an old classic.

This is essentially a basic dungeon explore game aimed at the family market and younger children. Rather than work together like a HeroQuest, this is a competitive game in that the players are racing each other to earn the most spoils.

Uses role and move and offers 4 character classes which have slightly different abilities and strengths against different monster types.

The board itself is split into various levels and the game scales the level of monster accordingly but it also scales the level of treasure.

So go to the deeper levels and the threat is greater but so is the loot.

The game ends when a character has earned a certain amount of gold and then gets back to the starting location. 

This is good entry level stuff but for gaming children of 10+ that have played a few titles they will need to move onto Talisman or Runebound as two examples.

This is not as good as HeroQuest.

A really fun game despite its age. Definitely on the simpler side, and there is quite a bit of randomness, but I think this works really well as a first dungeon crawler for newbies to the genre.

I enjoyed this somewhat in my youth and this game is as deep as I ever got into the D&D scene...probably a good thing. I imagine it speaks volumes for the game that I didn't use this as a springboard into deeper D&D gaming. This is a very simplistic Dungeon crawl type of game and has a few interesting decisions but all in all its pretty bland.

This game is a really simplistic dungeon crawler that is perfect for parents of younger kids to play together with the whole family.  Typical games don't last very long, so if you want to extend a session you'll need to institute some house rules most likely (which isn't very hard since the basic rules leave lots of room for flexibility which is nice).

I would call this a great gateway game for kids 6+ to get them interested in the genre for later in life.  I can say this from experience as I remember playing this game when I was that age and now I have the 2012 version to play with my kids!

Far too random to take a measured risk - you either play safe, or probably lose.
Bought for Christmas 2012, we've had many more games than shown here.  My then-6yo son enjoyed it because he could win at least half the time.  After a year of playing he went beyond Thief to take his game to a new level.  He still enjoys the occasional game two years later.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's pretty straightforward in its randomness: encounter a monster and roll dice to see whether you defeat it.  There might be some slight strategy in removing monsters that other player's characters would have been suited against, or going after difficult monsters when you have less loot to lose.  However, having to move across the board to get to the encounters would make executing either of those strategies prohibitively tedious.

This game basically amounts to Move to next room -> Roll dice -> Repeat. There is almost zero strategy involved, although perhaps the Wizard has a little bit in spell selection. There is also a balancing issue with warriors and clerics being able to raid the upper levels of the dungeon, denying the thief any chance of winning in the process. It's probably an okay game for 6 year olds learning their numbers and new to board games, but if you're used to the solid mechanics of Eurogaming, give this a pass - it's on par with Monopoly.

Repetitive and boring. Depends too much on factors other than strategic moves (mainly luck and whether you have other players close to you).

Best played with many players, but then it becomes very long and boring, because you do nothing out of your turn.

The production is cheap, but still very playable (and then the game is also very cheap, so it's a fair trade!).

I would only play once ina long while.

A simple but enjoyable dungeon crawl where you collect treasure and fight monsters, hedging your bets on the fast odds or playing it safe and slow.  The point is simply to collect a certain amount of gold before the other players and then head back to the exit first.  A decent mix of luck and strategy in this one though, and still rather enjoyable today.  The only thing that hurts the original Dungeon is the lack of additional layers of strategic complexity, explicitly the ability to attack other players (at least in the basic rules) while they're making their mad dash to the exit with the requisite 10,000GP.  Definitely recommended if ever seen at a flea market or garage sale--but if you're seeking Dungeon out online, try to get "The Classic Dungeon", so you'll have the newer features like co-op and ambushing.  However, this is definitely a great game even in its original incarnation.

An old favorite! One evening my wife exclaimed "I would like to win some treasures! Could we play a game where I can win treasures?" Next thing I know she is pulling Dungeon out of the back of the closet! She said she never played the Wizard while growing up, so she quickly read the rules for the Wizard character and taught me the rest of the game which she knew by heart! The game is actually quick and simple to play (medium light)! For my wife it is pure nostalgia and an awesome treasure collecting game!

Venture into the Dungeon, step into a room, draw a monster, kill it, and collect the treasure! Then move on to another room and see what happens! The monsters are deliciously fun (purple worm, black pudding, green slime and some old favorites like Trolls, Vampires and Ogres too)!

RATING: 7.7
Wonderful reprint of the original! It stays very true to the original monsters and treasures. There are some nice new components that take care of a couple of mechanical problems from the original. For example, one side of the board has a numbered row for placing your monster/treasure cards. This way you only have to place one number token on the actual dungeon room (the numbered edge of the board corresponds to the actual room). 

The cards are updated with new graphics for easier reading. Several cards have the same fun artwork from the original, and others have been updated. I like them for the most part. I sleeved them to protect them better. Since I still have the original, I have seen how the test of time effects those cards.

Too lightweight to be anything but a luck-fest for male tweens. The map's a dungeon made up of rooms from Level 1 (easy) to level 6 (hard). Move 5 spaces. If you get to a room, reveal a random monster for that level, see what you have to roll to defeat it (which is different for each type of character). If you roll it, collect a random treasure worth money. If you don't, roll a punishment die, which may be to drop treasure, lose turns and the like. Repeat until someone gets back to base having collected enough money to win for their character type. The one interesting concept was that characters are either weak (so don't go to high level rooms ... you'll die) but don't require as much money to win. Strong characters have it easier to win battles but need more money to win. Intra-game it means people go off in different directions to fight the most lucrative monsters they're likely to beat. Meaning there's little interaction, except for the race aspect to get to some cells first. Other than that, cheer for good dice rolls, groan at low dice rolls and that's all it has to offer. Which ain't much these days compared to other stuff around.

RATING: 3
A decent way to kill an hour, perhaps, and certainly the game has its uses in terms of bringing non-gamer types into the fold.  You can teach the basic game in under ten minutes and start rolling dice.  In the end, it's just too random, and there's very little you can do to stop someone once they get off to a strong start.  Advanced rules get quite unbalanced, as Warriors and Wizards run off to clear the easy levels - denying those rooms to weaker characters (dwarf, elf, thief).  If the warrior or wizard gets a magic sword in the process... game over.

I remember playing the original TSR game Dungeon when I was a kid.  I bought the newer version when it came out, and I'm not terribly disappointed.  Yes, it has a pretty heavy luck element.  However, it's still a decent game, but it's definitely not for the strategic person

 If you have children, you will have a blast because they will have a blast. Great for children new to more advanced boardgames (aka not monopoly jr, chutes and ladders, candyland ....) introduces decision making, options and strategies, and it all comes crashing down with one bad roll of the dice. 7.5

BGG SS 2014.  Have played a few games and it is great to relive childhood memories.  Kind of sucks when a stronger character goes into the lower levels, wipes the floor with those monsters, and then complains that they don't have enough gold to win.  All the while, the lower level character just dies because they are forced into stronger areas.

The game can be fun, and is very fun when you make additional rules to make it more complicated. I also like it for it's numerous items (Like the system of if the sword is plus one or two). It also has a enough luck but not to much to fry your brain, and a lot of fun. This game is an all around good game and is fun and exciting.

The ultimate roll-and-move fantasy slashathon (except for maybe Talisman, but I haven't played that). Basically no skill, either the theme does it for you or it falls flat. I used to play with my parents back in the day, and it's probably partially responsible for getting me into the hobby. I'd never choose to play it if I could avoid it though, too long and not deep enough. It deserves respect for its roots, not for its play.

Original comment: Great kids fantasy game.    Revised comment: Since Ameritrash evolution, people shouldn't feel the need to apologize for good ratings for games such as these. Dungeon is a VERY strong light fantasy dungeoncrawl for kids and kids at heart. From the games I've played, it is the BEST light dungeoncrawl game ever made. Some of the comments here are quite ridiculous. Luck is not a flaw in a game, and "too long to set up"? "10 minutes to explain the rules"? You've got to be kidding.....  Many dungeon games try to layer on too many elements (see Descent for textbook case) while Dungeon is blazingly fast, and accomplishes what it tries to do - exploring a dungeon and fighting monsters for treasure - in 15 to 30 minutes, tops. Anyone who doesn't get a young fantasy boardgamer this game is doing them a disservice.

"Roll and move" adapted to dungeon delving. It was great fun as a kid, but I expect I would find it less fun now. Though I wouldn't mind getting an early printing and testing the theory....

A cheap and basic game for kids aged 5+ to play. It's a fun family game. You can easily add some extra rules to give it a bit more complexity and strategy. That's what we did anyway. Try and find some plastic miniatures for both the heroes and the monsters, it makes a huge difference to the fun factor. We use some LotR orc minis to be "wandering monsters" in the hallways which is a great little addition.

This is a very tough game to rate because of the nostalgia value.  Truth be told, the game has few if any relevant decisions and is almost completely luck-based, but oh how I loved it as a kid.  I can't wait until my boys are old enough to try it.
Update: And the boys have now played it (at age 5, almost 6).  They liked, I liked it.  I had to raise my rating to 7 as a result. 
Update 11/2008: After several plays, I'd have to say the Elf & Hero have a big advantage in this game.  Levels 1 to 3 are really no challenge even for the weak characters.  Levels 5 and 6 are way harder for the strong characters.  Plus, all of the treasure rooms are blocked by chambers, unlike the easy levels. 
Update 12/2010:  Still liking this game with the kids.  But, playing it makes me want to create my own version that is less fiddly and has more variety.

RATING: 5
This game should be played as a light adventure game when the players don't need a brain burner, don't mind a lot of luck, don't mind a lack of interactive competition, and like a generic or D&D fantasy theme. If those conditions are in place, the game can be a fun experience. If those conditions are not in place, the game will likely be agonizing and unrewarding for some or all of the players. 

[b]Positives[/b]
:d6-1: Simple game play makes this title suitable for a young child or as a good choice when a light game is desired.
:d6-2: The artwork is fun, especially the individual element that makes each room and chamber different. This is an improvement in my mind over the older version I've played.
:d6-3: There is not much down time per player so a turn can resolve fairly quickly. 
:d6-4: The price makes this an affordable game.

[b]Negatives[/b]
:d6-1: A game can drag out with poor rolls to the point of frustration for many players. 
:d6-2: A player who doesn't appreciate fantasy should probably stay away as the theme will be lost on them and the gameplay offers little in meaningful choices to compensate.
:d6-3: The cards are too small and as such are hard to handle. They should be bigger, though not as big as standard playing cards. 

[b]Neutral[/b]
:d6-1: The outcome is heavily luck dependent and meaningful decisions, while present, are few.
:d6-2: The fantasy theme will likely be appreciated by those with a love of fantasy or D&D. It will likely be a turn-off for those without.

[b]Summary[/b]
This is a good game for those family or fantasy gamers who are looking more for a light hearted social experience. It is heavy on luck, light on decisions, and has some fun generic fantasy art. I think this can be a great game for parents or older siblings to play with young children. If you don't like fantasy or are looking for something with tense decisions and little luck, then you should look elsewhere. Also, if you carry more of a serious gaming mentality than an easy going mentality you should stay away.

Besides nostalgia, I appreciate this game because it is a good family game and is inclusive of, and maybe designed for, younger gamers.

Most basic of games--this one was so much fun when I was 9 and one of the few games my little sister could comprehend and play with me.  Of course, reacquiring that excitement is unlikely now that I am not 9 years old anymore--TSR was not the most adept of board game design outfits--but it is quick, straightforward, and light.  Would get a 3 (pretty 2-dimensional and dull overall) but added 1 for nostalgia and an extra .5 point because I like dungeon-based games in general.

Played this a lot as a kid, and played again recently with a friend and his kid. I couldn't quite remember how the game kept the tension up. I guess powerful characters like the wizard start at higher levels right away and just skip the lower levels, and the less powerful characters never end up getting to the higher levels of the dungeon at all. That seems a bit strange to me.

I played New Dungeon! a lot in my mid teens, alongside Dungeonquest, Sorcerer's Cave, Talisman, and actual AD&D. Altho this was the simplest and least intrinsically interesting of the bunch, I found that I usually enjoyed it, as fast brainless fun.

Bought the new edition and it has gone down well with my 2 and 4 year olds. For me the plusses are much improved art and the compactness - and needless to say costing £12 delivered! Well-worth getting if you have kids who you want to grow up into D&D nerds. Dubious merit otherwise.

Pros: Clear, consistent artwork.
Easy to understand rules.
Clear symbology.

Cons: Totally random, no skill involved at all. A couple bad rolls can take you out of the game and basically waste your next hour while you wait for everyone to finish.

Way too long for what it is.

Some treasures, if gotten early, are ridiculously imbalanced.

Heavy use of "lose a turn" mechanism, there were periods of 8+ minutes where I did nothing.

No player interaction. The only way you can affect another player is to kill the monster that he dropped treasure to and take it. Other than you, it's a solitaire game where you have to wait a couple minutes between each turn.

If you fall behind early, you're screwed. At the end of the game, I had only a little more than 1/10th of the treasure needed for me to start back to the Great Hall and win, while two people had more than their required amount. All that, and I'd only dropped one piece of treasure to a monster.

Slow movement.

Imbalanced classes, if the Wizard does not get enough treasure to win with his first round of spells, he has to take 5+ turns to walk back to the middle, ~2 to refill his spells, and then 5+ to walk back to the area of his level.

This is one of my first board games that I picked up in the 80s, with money I made from mowing lawns... HA! I really enjoyed board games before I ran into this one as I played Monopoly, Risk, Clue, etc. with my family quite a bit. When I picked this one up though, I was hooked on games and wanted to become a board game designer. My first board game prototype stemmed from taking the dungeon crawl out of "Dungeon!".

This classic also got me started into pen and paper role playing games and the desire to build my own adventures.  Its way too simple for my tastes now a days, but it still holds a place in my heart as my first fantasy based game.

After playing a few more games, I realized that Dungeon! is actually an okay game. At first glance, it looks unbalanced and too light to have any strategy. Now I realize that while the characters seem unbalanced compared to each other, the dungeon itself creates the balance, with the different encounters and the layout of the map itself. Still light, and sometimes maddening when the dice seem cursed, but fun enough for occasional play.

Plays in around an hour, although I can see how games can drag especially if the dice rolls are against you. Plus the more powerful characters could spoil the game for the weaker ones by looting most the low level dungeons first.

Enjoyable for what it is, however wifey hates the theme and has vowed never to play again!

Looks like just the solo quests for me then.

UPDATE: Gifted away to friends after playing with their kids (who loved it)where it will probably see more plays.

RATING: 8
Played a solo game against myself to test the game mechanics using all characters, enjoyed it and looking forward to play with others. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, once you know how to play a character and where to go for the best chance at winning then it is up to dice rolls. Ends up being an awesome, mindless fun, race against opponent starter game to a game night.

Oddly enough, for being a game from 1975, I was able to pick this gem up in a board game store in the local mall.  They had it just sitting out and I saw the D & D label on it and decided to give it a try.

This is the version I had as a kid and that my rating is based on, as eventually my father and I just found the game too flawed, and so we got rid of it. I suspect the 1975 version was better.

RATING: 7
In addition to playing with your regular gaming buddies, this is also the perfect game for playing with a distracted crowd, with children and with non-gamers. For example in our latest two sessions three gamers were huffing and puffing around the table, yet the only female player who only phoned in her performance (she was constantly running around doing other things), turned out to be the winner twice in a row. The three of us felt like newbie chess players who had just played against a grand chess master, while she didn't even break a sweat. The game itself is fairly simple, rules are not hard to grasp, the presentation is excellent and even though there is a fair bit of luck and dice-rolling involved, we found all our games quite enjoyable.

I have a really warm spot in my heart for this game. It was the   dungeon crawler boardgame I ever played. It makes me absurdly happy now to play it with my daughter. It's not a great game, but it strips the essence of random dungeon crawls right to the core. Nostalgic fun.

Not a game I'm usually drawn to, but it can be good fun once in a while. After a while, play feels a bit predictable, and the lack of card variety adds to that. More monsters and treasure would go a long way. And I'd hunt down some of the user-created house rules floating around the internet before playing, to fix some of the issues that the designer seems to have overlooked (e.g. why ever play the dwarf?)

But it's a great family game, even for young kids: I'd go so far as to say +2 points for family game night.

Have an original TSR copy of this game that we have played to death. We even made up our own special rules for the game. Unfortunately, we marked up the cards and rulebook to do so. Oh well, we have always had great fun with it and still break it out from time to time. The main detractor has always been the setup!

Reasonably short, extremely simple game.  You just walk around a dungeon rolling dice to fight monsters and collecting their treasure until you have enough to win the game.  You get the picture after just a pair of plays, there's not really anything new or new strategies to find after that.

It's fun enough to fill a time gap the first few times but after that it gets pretty boring.

2-8 players.
Difficulty: Beginner

RATING: 7
La versión con la que cuento es "Calabozo - La aventura de los Anillos" en español.

Un juego bastante con bastante rejugabilidad, recomiendo jugar para 4 jugadores o más, de forma individual o por equipos.

Es poco tardado por el azar de los dados en los combates, pero divertido con respecto a la variedad y los conflictos contra los monstruos. El único problema es que los accesorios mágicos (botas y llave mágica) dan demasiada ventaja al portador de estos con respecto a los demás jugadores, así como las armas mágicas.

Se requiere un espacio amplio para jugar debido al tablero de juego. Muy inmersivo en ocasiones y recomendable para mayores de 11 años.

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  This game is all about pure luck.  Really it is a quite pointless game of dice rolling and random card drawing.  The only reason to play it again or have it is because my kids like it.  They have fun running around the board "fighting" monsters and getting treasure.  Especially my 6 year old daughter really loves this game, I think because she is just as "good" at it as adults.  So it will see more plays as my kids will beg to play it more.  I suspect that even for kids though the replay value is pretty limited.  Anyway I think I have gotten the 50 cent entertainment value out of my copy that it cost to second hand store to buy it.

Owned as a kid. Bought the new version released by WOTC a few years ago more as a nostalgia kick. It's a random dice fest with minimal strategic decisions.

My 5 year old son can handle the maths needed for dice rolls, has rudimentary enough reading/memory skills to handle the cards, so I find this is hitting the table a bit with him. Not really recommended for grown-up gamers though.

I'm divided on this game.  On one hand, I find it boring and unbalanced.  On the other hand, my son loves this game and it's important that I play board games with him.

This game used to rock so hard when I was a little one, but pretty much ranks up there with clipping my toe nails now. It's not horrible, but it's not a whole big bunch of fun either. If you like D&D then maybe play some D&D. This is no substitute.

That being said, some one will have to pry it from my corpse due to it's inherent nostalgic value.

Dungeon-crawlers usually displease me as they feel like yards of icing and busy work hung atop a simple craps mechanism:  roll to hit/beat a point, or fail.  Not so with Dungeon!  This is a clean, simple game with few modifiers.  Yes, this is best enjoyed by children, but it makes few pretenses to adults, either.  The new edition looks pretty and moves as fast as Yahtzee.

My first purchase ever: the purple box Dungeon.  I took my $20 from a paper route to Walt's Hobby Shop in downtown Joliet, IL, and picked this one out myself, which is a big deal when you're 12.  

My set had black and white artwork on the faces of the cards. The card backs were a deeper tone with no artwork and just text identifying the level and whether it was a monster or treasure.  The 'board' was an over-sized plastic mat much larger than the folding board in later editions.

I do not see any photos of this edition, however one photo does show the plastic mat, and another, the box.

Players explore a dungeon that is divided into levels of increasing difficulty fighting monsters for valuable treasure. As players venture deeper into the dungeon the monsters become more difficult and the treasure more valuable. Combat is simulated using dice. The winner is the first player to bring a certain amount of treasure back to the Dungeon's entrance.

I like this game with 2 or 3 players. More than that and it seems to drag on forever. If it worked with more players better I'd rate it a good amount higher. If you're only ever going to play it with a small number of players, get it, it's worth it.

I got this game in about 1981 and it was for some years one of my absolute favourites, until I discovered the likes of Conquest of the Empire.  Because luck is by far the major factor in this game, it is no longer amongst my favourites.  However, it does have some thought in it and there are many variabls and many ways to play it, so I still enjoy it, especially if seeking a simpler game to play.  My 5-year-old daughter absolutely loves it, especially since it has dragons and treasure, and it is easy for her to learn yet much more exciting and complicated than the likes of Candyland.

We do play without death -- you just get kicked out of the room or chamber if you fail.  That way no hurt feelings and the game moves at a decent pace.

Played very quickly this is a fine filler game.  To make it filler though, you have to play very fast.

Strangely fun, given the lack of any sort of strategy. Has been house-ruled quite heavily, mind you- indeed the rules are unclear about what happens in some situations.

I used to enjoy this as a kid...now I just think it&#039;s pretty simplistic.

A lot of other games have raced past this one, but its nostalgia factor is plenty high!

I loved this game as a little boy,  and I still love it! I'm not so keen on the art style of the fourth or fifth editions; the third is what I remember so fondly. But the game play is the same, so I guess I can live with it.

Rating purely for nostaglic reasons.  It&#039;s been so damn long since I played I have no idea really.

Played with kids, and adults who loved old-school D&D, Dungeon! can be a barrel of fun.

I heartily suggest you play using user 'chromaticdragon' chamber and hero-class cards - they really invigorate a somewhat workmanlike game design (I won't play without them).

We've house-ruled this to death, BTW.

There's a special charm to it, although it's not that mentally stimulating in the strategy department.  It's a simple move, and then roll to see what happens mechanism, but the gambling is what makes it fun — somewhat.

Lots of fun to play, very light, quite "random" with dice chucking, but always fun with the family, and if you have a group you can't get heavy with, you can still get the dungeon theme out of this with them :)

This is a play of the board game Dungeon! a D&D dungeon crawling board game, with a low level of difficulty. This is fun fast to play dungeon crawling game for up to 4 people. In the game you move and plunder rooms in this labyrinth of caves, fighting the monster in a room if you win, win some loot, have the most loot to win. For a fun factor this get a sold 8+/10.

I enjoyed this very light dungeon crawl game. It is pretty simple to learn and teach. This is one that could be used as a gateway in more complex RPGs games. This game is however very luck based so that may be an aspect that can turn many off from it.

Light entry level themed dungeon game. Very easy to teach. This gets trumped after a play or two with medium to heavy games of the same type.

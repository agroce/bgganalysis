Drive is great. 3 player is awesome!, adding more people and changing the end game requirements makes this a better game. 2 is great, 3 is best, 4 is kinda chaotic.

RATING: 6
For such a simple rule set, this is a very tense game.  Lots of difficult choices.  You can't ignore the low cards to try to score only high ones, it takes too long.  But how long can you keep your cards in your hand?  If you keep them too long, you'll end up having to get rid of some good cards..

Played a few times with two people. I'd consider trying with three, but not four.

It's definitely in that same family as Lost Cities and Battle Line. Simple 2p card game, and actually it's simpler than those ones. Like any simple game that's good, it seems like it's more than the some of its parts. Good amount of tension in such an easy-to-play package.

I think most gamers won't like it as much as those other ones, but I like it almost as much.

We have the Drive version, which has excellent artwork, and we play 2-player. This is a great set-collection cardgame with very simple rules.  Decisions can be difficult.  Each type of card has a point value, which also happens to be the quantity of that type in the deck.  Sets of high-valued cards are intrinsically valuable, but sets of lower-valued cards are harder to lose.  If you lay down a set, you don't have to discard.  This encourages you to lay down small sets so that you don't feed cards to your opponent, but smaller sets are easier to lose.  Overall, this is a perfectly balanced game that we really enjoy.  By the way, if you think this looks similar to Lost Cities: yes, it does.  The board and card placement look the same.  However, the gameplay is different, and there is more player interaction.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like most games designed by Michael Schacht, this has that *one good mechanic* (or is that "mechanism"?).  Here, tension is created by constantly having to choose between discarding - thus possibly helping your opponent - or laying down cards (melding) - thus (mostly) locking you into that number of cards in your set.  If one player starts laying down pairs (or other small sets), it seems that the other player must do the same, since the round will end if the first player gets 6 pairs down.  This may be a limitation of the strategy options.  More play is needed to check.  Given that the new version by SimplyFun supports up to four players, I look forward to trying that (with my original Ravensburger German set).  [Update:  I like this even better with three players.  It has a good tension!  This raises my rating from a 6 to a 7.]

RATING: 5
Components: [Crazy Chicken edition] Humorous artwork on easily-distinguishable cards, but the cards are not high quality, and the box's plastic insert is designed as a draw tray, even though the game requires a deck set-up that disallows the use of the draw tray.

[Drive edition] Easy to distinguish, but not as fun to look at as the chickens.

Experience: I read the rules and thought, "Is that all there is?" Having now played it, I realize that yes, there is nothing more to it than the rules let on, but the process of following those rules is slightly more enjoyable than I had expected. As the game progresses players are faced with decisions about whether to lay down what they have, or continue building up a set to make it more secure upon being laid down. There are subtle decisions to be made, but not thrilling ones. There are also huge swings in points, and in my most recent playing, I found that several moves I might take to gain more points would actually end the game, with me the loser.

This game is similar to Knizia's Vampire.

Played two games with four players at a local meetup. A simple game where you take two cards and either discard one or play a set from your hand. Sets played have to contain at least one more card than any existing set of the same value. The interesting decisions come from the fact that players can pickup cards from the discard piles as well. Not only are you trying to discard things that won't be useful later but you're also trying to bury useful cards in the discard pile so it can't be pulled out later. It's basically Rummy with a custom deck of cards.

Played 1 time. Since it is merely a numbered card game, I did not have high expectations for this game. When I did get around to playing it, I found it plesant and not too taxing and a bit better than I thought. Players are holding, dropping, melding cards trying to gain the upper hand, and it works quite well. Fairly lucky, but not bad at all.

purchased from Steve Z.  2 player card game by Ravensburger, out of print, hard to print, gets top rating by some (some say Lost Cities lovers need to play this one.)  I think Lost Cities a better game.  Some aspects of Crazy Chicken remind me more of Bohnanza.  However, Bohnanza I like better with a lot of players where as this one is designed for 2.  Enjoyable to play once in awhile, because usually who goes first wins, and a lot of luck in the card draw. 

About the only strategy comes in discarding--figure statistics on what your opponent might be holding, and counting cards.

Michael Schacht's answer to Lost Cities... an interesting set-collecting game with Herr Schacht's inevitable multiple draw piles and a nice "push-your-luck" mechanism for deciding when to meld. This is one I'd like to find. (You just have to get past the bad chicken puns.)

Fun and fast.

RATING: 7
Too bad this one is out of print, as it takes the game of Lost Cities in a different thematic direction, and adds real interaction.

Drive is actually a 2-4 player game, and I've only played it two player solo, but I can see why some think of it fondly.

The game play is in collecting unbalanced sets of cards with classic cars; the number on the card is both the # of cards in the set, and the number of points for the person scoring the set of cards. But only the one with the longest set gets to score it; the other must discard a shorter set immediately.

As #sets laid down is a hand end condition, this leads to the question of timing a set going down (depending on the opponents # of sets, and cards remaining/discarded, etc).

This ability to change the opponent's score with a better set is the added interaction, and it makes the game much more head-to-head.

As I said, I have not tried it for more than 2, and more players should add more luck in terms of actually getting desired cards, but the car theme is much more appealing to me than the 'Crazy Chicken' one, even if the artwork isn't quite as eye-catching as Lost Cities'.

So I will start this at 7, and see what gameplay does to that score.  I would still probably pull out Web of Power 1st for the Michael Schacht experience, but this is a nice game, and is probably still pretty good with chickens if you don't mind the artwork.

First played September 11th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (<5min) and a quick play (~25 min).  We played it two player, I think it's only two player?  It has a decent balance of strategy and luck for a card drafting game.  Score sets if you have five sets or if all nine sets are played out.  It's interesting that you can wipe out your opponents scores by upping your meld by one.  I'd recommend giving this a game play if you know someone who has it.  It's a good filler material as well.  Give it consideration for purchase if you have overplayed your filler games and need a new one to try out.

Gift from Thrifty Santa 2010.

It plays 2-4 players, and it's somewhat similar to Canasta, with a little feeling of Lost Cities (it's the board in the middle) and maybe a hint of Piece o' Cake.

There are two face down draw piles and two face up discard piles. On your turn you have to draw from two different piles, then you either lay down a set or discard. 

Laying down a set is two or more cards of the same number. You cannot add to a set. If you can lay down a new set with more cards than a previous set, you knock the previous set back to the discard pile. 

Sets are worth their face value. Sixes are worth 6 points, which isn't much, but once you have a set of 3 (or a pair, and you have a third in your hand) you know they're locked in (there are 6 sixes, 7 sevens, etc.).

The game ends when a pile of each number (6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20) is showing on the table, or one person has 6 piles (2p) or one of the discard piles is depleted. Then you count points, most points after 3 rounds wins.

I've got the chicken version and doubt I would like Drive quite so much, despite identical gameplay.  Comparisons to Lost Cities are fair.  I like this a bit more, though I can't quite say why.  Perhaps it's the ability to directly ruin your opponent's plans, not by playing a card he wish he had drawn (though sometimes), but by beating his not quite unbeatable combination.  And after a decent handful of games, the strategic (for example, do I play small combinations quickly, or try to build up to unbeatable ones) are far from obvious, and probably depend to a great extent on what your opponent does (or seems to be doing (or is he?)).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Very low quality cards in the Simply Fun edition of the game. The cards are flimsy and the finish on them is so rough that they can't slide laterally. You can improve the finish a bit by repeatedly shuffling the cards, because they'll basically sandpaper the finish off each other. I imagine that you could eventually wear them down enough to slide smoothly if you played enough.

Gave away because the game wasn't interesting enough to be worth dealing with the garbage cards.

This is a nice alternative to Lost Cities.  It plays at nearly the same pace, and is a fun game of (gulp) chicken.  How long do you dare hold out to lay down your cards?  The timing is very important.  Sure, there's a big amount of luck in the card draws, but in the end the more skillful manager should come out on top.  I don't particularly like the artwork - I can't believe how many games I have that have chickens or other fowl!  But all in all I enjoy this game quite a bit.

On the lookout for another "[GAMEID=50]"-type game, we saw on [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/234350]this thread[/url] that you could use a [GAMEID=11] deck to play [GAMEID=6137].  The bean cards actually work pretty well, and it feels similar to [GAMEID=11] in planting sets of beans.

The core gameplay looks like the basis of [GAMEID=34127] without the annoying memorization component.   It's also a reasonable alternative to two player [GAMEID=11].  Two player [GAMEID=11] is a little more complicated and focused on hand management while [GAMEID=6137] is a little simpler and more of a risk management game---how long can you wait to keep collecting a set before the other person plays it?  It also has some of the tension that [GAMEID=50] does, where you have to worry if you're discarding something that will help your opponent.  As in [GAMEID=50], you're always watching what your opponent takes and discards, although here it feels like you're more limited in what cards you can pick up.  The best rounds of [GAMEID=6137] are the ones where there's a lot of back and forth between the players, and the worst ones are the where one player easily plants six sets of cards and wins.  Unfortunately, this happens more than we would like.

Also, although listed as a two player game, there's probably no reason more people couldn't play.

The cars version is much nicer than the silly chicken version. Collecting chickens makes absolutely no sense; collecting vintage autos makes some sense.

Finally!!

From Robbirob

This is a simple little game suitable for non-gamer significant other play. It's easy to learn and presents some light tactical challenge, and lots of luck (it is a card game after all).

Muy interesante juego de naipes para dos (eventualmente 3 y 4, con algunas variantes). Se juntan cartas de un mismo tipo; puedes juntar las que el otro jugador ha bajado (m√≠nimo de dos) siempre que bajes m√°s que las bajados por el otro. Los puntos son el n√∫mero de la carta (6,7,8,10,12,14,16,18,20)..y el n√∫mero de la carta indica cu√°ntas de cada tipo hay (hay 14 de tipo 14).

After reading the rules, I really thought I'd like this. I feel like the game runs a little longer than it ought to though. The decks are pretty large, and ultimately the game is too simple. I don't know why I'd play this over Rummy, or better yet, a modernized game that utilizes Rummy mechanisms in a better way, a la the Mystery Rummy games. This might be fun to play with your grandma, but that's about it.

RATING: 6.5
Fun, light game if you are looking for variety in a 2 player setting. There are 9 suits (twenty cards of 20, eighteen cards of 18, etc, much like Bohnanza). Players either draw 2 cards, then discard or play down a run of at least 2 cards of the same suit. The run must be more than any other run of the same suit on the table; owner of previous run must discard that suit. Round ends when all 9 suits are on the table, or one player has 6 suits, or when one draw pile is exhasusted. Score the suit values and play over 4 rounds.

First impression (2 player, just 1 round out of 4) : It's a very simple card game. You draw 2 cards and either play down a set of cards or discard a card. Sets must have more cards than previously played set of same number (number is both points & amount of them in deck). At the end of the round you score points for every set. There seems to be pretty big element of luck depending how bigger numbered cards are being dealt to players.

Build and steal, build and steal. Playable, but not a lot of tension. It's decent for 2, but the fun sucked out when we played with 3. I think the problem is that there's no tension. Compare to Lost Cities, another simple play and draw, but you end up having several agonizing moments when compelled to play a card too early. Or to the Mystery Rummy set which adds energy through the special cards. This is a set collecting game without the spark or theme-invoking fun.

Did this game inspire Mr Schmiel's Tribune? This is simply the take-over mechanic involving various chicken characters in which you only have to play more cards of one type than your opponent, the game usually ending when one player has 6 or all 9 appear on the table. Deck distribution is indicated by the card value (a la Bohnanza), hence there is speculation as to getting a larger set in order to score the card value (not multiplied) at game end. Spouse friendly like Lost Cities, but although the unusual maths can detract from the subconscious tension, it is easy to resolve.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A rummy variant that is very similar to Knizia's Vampire. I would rate the two games equally if it wasn't for the poor color choices in Vampire. This is also similar to Schacht's Station Manager.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played themed as Drive - the car collecter game. Nice # on cards matches # of cards matches point value for claiming the highest set at end of the round. The two discard piles is flawed as it is never in your interest to open the second discard pile which limits the choices.

One can sometimes do a bum's rush and quickly meld pairs to end the round before others realize it and counter with larger sets.

I played this game as Drive, not Crazy Chicken. I had a great deal of fun with this one. It's a light filler; great for rounding out a game session. It's also very easy to explain to new players. Probably the thing I like the most is that since there are twenty cards worth 20 points, the strategy is also clear to everyone at the outset:

"To get more points, make the more numerous sets, which are harder to keep."

I think it's probably a better idea to buy a copy of Bohnanza and play the game with Drive's rules. Then you get two games for the price of one!

I really don't like the art, but several people in my group find it very amusing. The game is still very good.

Drive -- Played once; four-player.  Rating may improve when played with different number of players.  It seemed that four players was too many, but with two there might not be enough division of interest.  I'd like to try with three.  Based on our four player game, I wouldn't suggest Drive, but play was easy enough that I wouldn't turn down a game if someone else craved it.

A solid set collection game for up to 4 players. Getting harder to find but worthwhile if you tend to like a quick card game. If I had to nitpick, the 8 & 9; 14 & 18 cards are similar in color...if distracted, you can mistakenly grab the wrong card. Small issue though, pick it up if you can.

Harmless melding game.  The kind of game you might play to pass the time over some chatting.  Mostly relaxing with some occasional needling.  There are some worthwhile decisions to make controlling the pace of the game. Because there are three different ways the game can end, much of this game is timing the luck to see what points you can get away with and what you points you can insure.

If you like Rummy games this is a nice twist on the concept.

[Ravensburger 'Crazy Chicken' 2003 edition] {Animal, couple; drafting, set-collection} Crazy Chicken is a fun set collection game.  Player interaction is surprisingly nice.  The pressure of game end forces players to react differently; thus hoarding cards won't work (because a player can only show one set per turn).  There are a few tricks to discard opponent's sets with a surprise.  Good memory could increase win chance as one would know whether a set is safe or not.

The illustration is cute.  I like it.

Playing with 4 rounds per game is long.  I prefer to play with 3 rounds.

In this remake of the card game Crazy Chicken, they changed the theme from chickens to antique cars, so that now everything makes perfect sense.

Right.  

Drive is identical to it's predecessor in every way with the exception of expanding to 2-4 players.  However,  I would only play this sparingly - and that with the stipulation that it were a two player affair.  If any more were on offer,  I would most likely take a pass,  as in that instance,  Drive more closely resembles a car crash.

Lost Cities, look out!  I'm sure that if this game were more available, and more well-known, that people would be claiming this to be the new "spouse game."  It's simple, has some interesting choices to make along the way, and is the kind of game that reveals a hidden layer of depth the more you play it.  The two draw piles and discard piles, along with the ability to replace someone else's score pile, add a bit of a challenge to the usual Rummy variant.  The game is also balanced well, since the primary strategy of laying down as many groups of cards as possible is tempered with the need to secure certain groups with enough cards so that they're not replaced by your opponent.  The game can drag out if you wind up ending rounds by depleting a draw deck, but it happens rarely enough that I can't see it being a consistent problem.

[b][i]Crazy Chicken [/i][/b]is similar to Knizia's [i]Vampire[/i] in terms of collecting sets of chickens (vampires) and knocking out the other player's score. I can't imagine playing four rounds, though; once through the deck is enough game for me. More at once would likely have me whacking the game's head off.

Oh, and thumbs down for the Simply Fun remake ‚Äì [b][i]Drive [/i][/b]‚Äì that has players collecting cars instead of chickens. Sure, more people collect cars than chickens in real life, but if I wanted real life, I wouldn't be playing a game in the first place! Also, in addition to losing the fab caricatures, the cards in [i]Drive[/i] have that clamminess that oftens comes with Chinese productions, making them difficult to shuffle and handle.

I find this game to be another angst causing game in the vein of [gameid=50].  However, I find that this game is a little less of a multiplayer solitaire.  There is a very strong "take that" element in stealing cards or covering up discard piles you know your opponent is collecting.  Each turn there is always a choice, and inevitably you will make the wrong one.  The goal then becomes not to make the worse wrong choices.

My feeling is that the rating is lower than Lost Cities because it is a little harder to find.  From my stand point, I would rather play Crazy Chicken than Lost Cities.  Both are great fillers, but I can win Crazy Chicken where my wife can't!

Drive from Simply Fun.  Yet another Rummy-like card game with a bit of player conflict added in.  At first I thought this wasn't too bad with some interesting decision in terms of hand and discard management, but then the fact is a round could end very quickly by playing pairs of card types others happen to lack, which pretty much robbed my sense of enjoyment.

Crazy Chicken is certainly fast, but I'm not exactly sure if it's fun.  Even if it is Michael Schacht.  There are some really interesting things going on during the course of the game, though.  There's some tension between whether or not you should lay down a group or wait to make it bigger in hopes that your opponent will lay it down first so you can ruin their plans.  I want to play it more, certainly.  It's decent so far; we'll see how the rating stands after a few more plays.

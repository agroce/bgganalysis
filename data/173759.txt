Kickstarted. With two 2-player games so far, we found it fun and close enough to make it a strategic and tactical game. The potion names are pure chrome, and there seem to be some game-balance issues in two player (the Occultist in particular can just screw her opponent every turn). But it was a nice card and tile game. One drawback is with many different types of cards and pieces, it's got a significant set-up and putting-away time for the lightness of the game.

Someone offered something I was more interested in as part of  a deal that was greatly in my favor shortly after I received the KS.

Played the PnP tonight for the first time and loved it. This copy will be worn out by the time the official release arrives (Kickstarter est Jan 2016) as we can foresee a lot of table time in its future.

Not the worst "kickstarter" game I've played, but there is very little to recommend it. The mundane gameplay is interrupted by numerous "take that!" card plays. The roll-a-die-to-steal game mechanic would not have made it through traditional development. In fact, the game likely would not have been accepted by any traditional publisher.

Very nice components for the price.  The game can be a bit meaner than I expected it to be.

Fun family game with a great (and unique) theme. A very good mixture of strategy and take that.

Just like the alchemy it is themed in - CAULDRON boils down a little bit of resource management, take-that, and variable player power-up and brews it into pure gold.

This is the game! The game for novice players and seasoned boarders. Have been playing Cauldron since the game first came out. Various ways to win the game, I love trying out new strategies and new ways to try to win and mess with my opponents. This game has a little bit of everything, resource gathering, spells, skills and of course luck. Highly recommend.

One play, some nice ideas and gameplay, but too slow to start and too quick to finish.

Very fun game, and high quality components. Enjoy playing with some of the advanced rules. Very much a 'Take That!' game with a good theme.

A lot of 'take that' in this game, its fun making potions and screwing over the other players! Not a lot of depth here, but lots of fun.

Okay game but too much take-that for our tastes.

This was ok. I think it was a kickstarter, and it had that unpolished kickstarter feel where there was a solid foundation, but it just needed a bit more playtesting.

Meh. I feel like this game could be made to be very good, but there's something missing...

The "steal" mechanic is very bad.

Interesting exploring and foraging for ingredients for alchemy. Was a kickstarter. Look for around Jan 2016. Was $24 for US backer.

I like the game but it has kind of a slow start.  The 2 groups I've played with so far didn't really find the game interesting until half way through.

Played with 2 and 5.   Not sure if there is a better sweet spot as 5 proved to be too much take that and went on a bit too long at the end.

While I like the mechanics of this cutthroat game, it suffers from Munchkin-itis. As in, it's too easy for everyone to work together to prevent someone from ending the game. So the last segment of the game drags on for far longer than the 60-90 minute time estimate.

read the rule book I love it. What will make or break this game are the cards. I've looked at a few of them but should be fun.

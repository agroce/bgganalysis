Above average game play.  Fantastic miniatures.  We regularly utilize the miniatures in our table top RPG sessions due to their detail and accurate representation of Monstrous manual entries. 

While the D&D big box game minis are good, these minis are better as the have the great sculpting as well as being pre painted.

Played only a few times since my friend and I had to split my warband in half to play. The idea of having to buy another one is enticing, but it's hard to give up 40$ for another version of what is essentially the same game. Still, I did love adding the adventure system cards to my Legend of Drizzt box!

Low-medium complexity fantasy miniatures skirmish game.  It is themed around D&D 4th edition, but has little in common with that game.  Creatures automatically hit when they attack and do a fixed amount of damage (which can be boosted or reduced by card play).  It's fine, but doesn't excite me.  I would prefer to have dice rolls to liven things up.  The miniatures are quite nice for pre-painted minis.  Including cards to use the minis with the [family=9547]D&D Adventure System board games[/family] is brilliant.

Dungeon command is a great blend of tactical miniature combat and magic the gathering. Made by WotC (same as MtG, it combines what I think are the best elements of Magic (the creatures and spells) and puts it on a board to make it come to life. It works really well in 2,3,4 or even 5 players. Either as a FFA or team vs Team. I wish they made more sets, but there is a nice variety and the (un)official drafting variant, is a nice way to mix it up.

RATING: 6.33
By themselves, the Dungeon Command games are decent, but nothing special. 12 miniatures to battle with, four tiles, and a small deck of cards does not really offer much variety and you HAVE To buy another set to really play. Put the costs together, and it is questionable whether it is worth it for just 24 units. But it is a solid game despite this problems. BUT... if you own any of the D&D cooperative games, you can ALSO add the miniatures to that for more variety there! My rating is based solely on the game as a stand-alone, but I really own it as an expansion for my Wrath of Ashardalon and Castle Ravenloft games.

Well presented: very nice pre-painted minis; quality art on cards; map on hard stock. I love the fact the that monsters can be directly integrated into other D&D board game sets (Castle Ravenloft, et al) without rules adjustments (brilliant in its simplicity).  I like the idea of various factions and hope that WoC pursues further sets. Basic, fun stand alone skirmish game. The small map squares, however, do not accomidate the minis.

Dungeon Command has been compared to games like Star Wars: Epic Duels, Summoner Wars, and Magic: The Gathering, and there are certainly elements of all of those here. Dungeon Command is primarily a tactical minis game, with movement and positioning being crucial to victory. However, it is also a card game (hence the Magic comparisons) and hand management plays a big role as well.

Each player controls an army of 12 figures and a deck of 30 or more cards. A figure has an inherent movement, attack value, and special abilities. But all of these can be enhanced by playing cards on them. Knowing when to play these cards and how to position your figures are two of the biggest choices the game offers. Despite having diceless combat, almost nothing in this game is calculable, which I love. There is never an obviously right answer for how far you should move, whether you should get a treasure, whether to stay together or split up, to play a card or not, to cower (which hits your morale) or not (which kills your units), and so many other choices.

For a relatively simple rule set, I think Dungeon Command offers a ton of meaningful choices and a depth of gameplay that will require many games to master. None of that even takes into account the additional layer of customizable army/deck-building. This one is a winner.

This game sits squarely between Magic: The Gathering and Summoner Wars for me--and takes the place of both in my collection. Cool painted minis (that are compatible with the D&D Adventure System games) liven up the presentation but the real hook here is that diceless, card-driven gameplay combined with a decent little tactical miniatures game.

* I track all Dungeon Command plays, and my overall thoughts on the game, on Curse of Undeath (the first faction I tried). I want to know how often I play it, not how often I play each faction. *

Of the four faction starters I've tried to date, this is the one that most closely matches my play style. Orcs are fun, death blows are fun, and there's a neat mix of stuff in here.

When I first bought these dungeon command games, I did it only for the miniatures and the tiles, as assets for d&d games. Yesterday after almost 4 years, me and my friends, decided to give them a shot as game.
The game is really interesting, both generals and the races can change a lot the game. It can be played with 3 and 4 people (we tried it both). Havent played the 2 player version yet, but the multiplayer system was great.
Strategy,  wargame, great miniatures and great cards. You have a lot to think, where to move, where to hide, what cards to use, which one to attack and with whom to hold peace. I am glad to have this in my collection. Loved the experience and my friends and wife, already ask for the next gamenight. Try it with multiplayer and have fun!

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Great replayability and variability due to:
--- random card drawing from deck
--- re-positioning of 4 board pieces
--- (so far) 5 very different factions 
--- different positioning and thus strategy of your warband every time
- Beautiful painted miniatures
- Beautiful cards
- Factions are balanced
- You can assemble your own Warband from more than 1 faction

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Lacks mechanic that will make fighting necessary (one player can just hide in convenient place and "wait until the other guy will step into the trap").
- Game under 3 hours are very rare
- There is no point to play it as 3-player game (there is no game mechanic against "hide and wait" strategy until other 2 players fight between each other)

Didn't play this one myself (yet) but faced them in our first 4-player game (which works really well but is a loooooong gaming experience; we added the house rule that once all the treasures are taken one has to attack at least once on your own turn to make sure no one hides it out). The Orcs are a brutal force with some really cool cards, not necessarily very elegant but effective, so far all the DC factions seem very thematic. 
Played this faction today, lost badly, partly because I had to split my attack up in our 3-player game, partly because of some short sighted choices, apparently brutal force still needs some strategy ;-)

Another great Dungeon Command set. This game is a lot of fun and is different enough from DDM skirmish that both games can comfortably exist side by side in my collection. Blood of Gruumsh is a well designed set that plays quite differently from the other DC sets so far released. I would give it a 9 or 9.5 if it wasn't for two minor issues: the quality of the paint isn't quite good enough and there are not enough WIS cards in the order deck.

I can't honestly say that I recall much about the Orcs other than their stupid name - seriously what is it with D&D having dumb names? WTF is a Gruumsh anyway?

I was mildly concerned about replayability, but since each turn you should only see about a third of your order cards and maybe a half of your creatures this should easily last 5 or 6 plays - at which point you change up the opposing army.

It doesn't feel particularly chaotic either, though I'd really only recommend the 2 player game...

The Dungeon Command series is a surprisingly delightful tactical war game that captures the essence of a D&D skirmish without the arcane and protracted rule set that governs a roleplaying session.  Sure, some of the rules do not make much sense such as cower and the line of sight for ranged weapons. These minor rule tweaks however, are likely necessary to make game play less clunky while improving the ebb and flow of each battle. I contend that these changes are essential for non D&D fans to embrace the board game. One very crucial deviation from the core mechanic of a D&D roleplaying campaign is the absence of playing an ever-increasingly powerful avatar. In this game, players control either racial or organizational factions led by an unseen leader. There is no concept of "leveling" or overarching storyline. This may turn off some dedicated D&D fans, but for the casual gamer who revels in a compact and efficient game minus the epic sagas, this game is both short and sweet.

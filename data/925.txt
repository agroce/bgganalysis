As party games go, this one needs almost zero preparation and materials as it can be played with a regular deck of playing cards to assign roles. It's a social event really that depends completely on the mood, setting and crowd. But given all that configured right, it's a great game. Needs to have at least 7 people minimum. Works better with 9 or 10.

My group differ on whether they prefer Werewolf or Mafia.  The former seems to have more control and is more logical, the latter is more chaotic and wild,.  I prefer the former, but they are both fun and play differently enought to make it worth owning both.

I love this game!!!  It's random, uncontrolled and crazy, but it's a ton of fun!  You have very little control over whether you win or lose, on either side.  It's almost pure luck, but the villagers arguing over who to get rid of is just too much fun.  We didn't play with extra roles, but even at a more basic form (1 seer, 2 werewolves, x villagers), I really enjoyed it!

One of my gaming groups is now playing this for several hours, weekly, and loves it.                       We play with a variety of special roles, such as:                     Masons (two villagers who know each other is a villager), Cobbler (he isnt a werewolf, but his job sucks so bad he wants to die, he is on the werewolf team, but he doesnt know who they are, nor them know him.  Tinker (looks like a werewolf to the seer, but isnt.  Fir best results, the Tinker doesnt know he is a tinker, one villager card at ranom is the Tinker).  Werewolf hunter (if it comes down to 2 people left, him and werewolf, he and villager win).  And many more...but you have to also have several basic villagers, or it gets broken.
                                   
I feel the game is best with 5, 7 or 9, plus moderator.

A great game but suffers from the problem of easily taking up the entire evening since it really doesn't have a proper end point.  Someone has to take a stand and declare the final round, or the group can easily play for four hours -- which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but with so many wonderful games, you need to spread the time around a little.

Popular because it's easy to play even with a standard deck of cards. I played it so much when I was younger. Why bother now where are far more better party games out there  like Avalon for exaple?

Yes, I actually *bought* a public domain game.  Having a "seer" card beats the hell out of answering the question "I got an 8 of clubs...what am I?" over and over again.  Nice design work and interesting cards make the published versions of this game more acceptable to a mainstream audience.

Oh yeah, and it's a lot of fun, too.

One of my favourite for a long time. Perfect for large groups, very funny, creative (you must conceal, sometimes deceive... you feel like an actor), deeply psychologic... so much that players sometimes take the fight too seriously! Even if I play it less by now, I still think this is a great game!

It's a good game to play if you have a large group...lots of social interaction!  However, the fact that people are constantly being eliminated from the game can take some of the fun out of it, especially if you're eliminated early and have to sit around silently and wait for the next game.

PROS
*) Great game concept
*) Simple rules
*) One of the very few games I know that are real fun with more than 8 players
*) Can be pretty exciting if the crowd is in the right mood

CONS
*) Grows old after time (After my first few games, it would have gotten an 8)
*) People who've been eaten or hung have to watch (which can be interesting, but the first to be killed have quite a long wait for the next game)

ADVICE
*) Use candles or tealights to symbolise the life of a player (as well as the card). In a dark room, this gives the right atmosphere.

popular and scalable game, no purchase necessary.  listen for gestures/action when your eyes are closed.  i like to ask people if they're the werewolf directly to gauge their reactions.  when people start stammering or start and completely stop sentences it tends to be a giveaway.  the most excited people on the end claiming "i know it's not me so it has to be one of you" are often honest.  fun to try with no verbal communication too.  i have learned that it's possible for me to get sick of this game though, and i've played it so much that i sort of dread it now.  i don't fully appreciate the tension of being a werewolf.

Wow. After 9 games of Werewolf in a row, my throat kind of hurts. A very fun game, even when you are killed off in the very first round.

UPDATE: After 31 plays, having a bit of a problem with the rating for this game. Now, I am almost always up for Werewolf, but the subjective nature of "I'll always want to play this" ... well, I mean, sometimes I'll want to play an actual game instead. In certain circumstances, though, this game is an easy 9, and possible 10.

Traded away in the Strategicon math trade, Gateway 2015.
Never opened my copy (which was a gift from my friend Mark), but I have played this with others.  I feel like this game is a money-grab/ripoff of "Mafia" (which anyone can play with a deck of cards).  This game re-themes Mafia, and takes that fun concept way too far, for way too long, IMO.
Generally I don't prefer "party/social games".

Keep in mind that I would rather play a strategy game when I'm surrounded by like-minded gamers.  However, the funny thing is that when I am among non-gamers I actually really enjoy spending time playing Werewolf/Mafia.

[i]Posted: 4/11/13, Rated: 9[/i]

Ah, [i]Werewolf[/i].  How shall I rate thee?

At its core, [i]Werewolf[/i] is more a psychological experiment on groupthink than it is a "game."  There are many generalizations bandied about such as "popularity contest" and "metagaming."  And they are to some extent true, as such generalizations can be.

The concept is simple.  The game is played in several rounds, each of which represents a day.  Each day has a day and a night phase.  During the day, everyone tries to deduce who are the evil werewolves.  One person gets voted out of the game (think angry villagers with torches and pitchforks).  Then the night phase begins, and the naughty werewolves get to rip a tasty villager to pieces.  The game can grow to be quite complex as special roles are added, adding or obfuscating information from this simple formula.

I have played [i]Werewolf[/i] in person, and in the forums here on BGG.  I have played games with friends, and also moderated games with co-workers.  [i]Werewolf[/i] can be outrageously fun as people loosen up and get into the spirit of the game.  The only downside that it suffers from is the down time experienced by players who are eliminated early in the game.  For that alone, I deduct a full point.

They play by forum (PBF) version of the game allows for more deliberate, thoughtful games.  If you are ever curious about trying this game, then [geekurl=/forum/58]check out the "Werewolf" forum here on BGG[/geekurl].  We'll be happy to [-]eat[/-] meet you.

This is a unique variant with exactly seven players on three teams. It hasn't been a huge hit - people get confused about who's hunting who, not realizing that all the sides are pretty much the same. I wouldn't mind trying it with a group of thoughtful gamers.

I give this game a high score for multiple reasons. One, with the right group it is a lot of fun. Two, it can accommodate large groups (20+) fairly easily. Three, the fan base has expanded the gameplay significantly with different character types. And four, it's very portable.

On the negative side, this game could easily be ruined by one or more players with the wrong attitude (cheating or just unable to get into it). A poor moderator/narrator could also ruin the game fairly easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very fun party game, easy to explain and grasp. The fact that it accomodates almost any number of players from 7 to anything makes of it a favourite at parties, gatherings and any kind of social meeting.
Player elimination is its main problem, because as a party game it'd be better if everyone were always involved, but it usually plays very fast and it's almost as fun to watch as it is to play.

Games like this (mafia,polar bears,etc..) tend go in either of two directions the "detective" form and the "avenger" form.In the detective mode people will ask each other questions and stare at each other waiting for a sign as to tell who the werewolf is but they usually "lynche" the wrong people (the seer is usually first to go) while the the avenger mode is were people are blood thirsty and will "lynch" anybody without cause (the seer is usually first to go).A good portion (if you are lucky) of the games you play will fall into the middle of the extremes where everybody is a little more cautious as to whom they "lynch" but there is a better chance of killing a werewolf (the seer is still usually first to go).I personally like the faster games and tend to do anything in my power to get myself "lynched" if I'm stuck in a "detective mode" game (I have been in way to many games were it takes a half-hour per round).--Nate--

We played this with our big group of mostly non-gamer friends and had a lot of fun with it.  We played for hours in fact on multiple occasions.  Then we just sort of burned out on it.  We added a couple new friends to the mix that just couldn't figure out how to have fun with it and we all quit playing.  I still really love this game though and am constantly looking for games that are similar, ie. Saboteur.  We played it again recently and it just crashed and burned again.  It is not the game though, it is the group.

(favorite many player)

I have never "played" werewolf, but I have moderated twice now, and it makes me sad. I want to play! :cry:

The first time, I was the moderator. I desperately want to "play" it. It's hard to get that many people in one room to play this game.

Second time was with family, over Thanksgiving. I was the moderator again. They seemed to have a good time.

New players and especially non-gamers seem to need direction, or to be given some reason for playing the game. To help noobies with their roles I've devised some aid text to accompany each role card.

[b]To be read/spoken to Werewolves:[/b] By day you are a peaceful villager, but by night you are a hungry Werewolf! During the night while you close your eyes, but while the rest of the village sleeps you will be asked by your moderator to awaken to greet your fellow Werewolve(s). When asked to open your eyes, don't stop tapping, open your eyes and together with your fellow Werewolve(s) point to the villager you all wish to eat. The moderator will acknowledge your choice and ask you to again close your eyes. When the new day dawns and you open your eyes, the villager you selected will be dead. The other Villagers will now need to determine who amongst them is not a peaceful villager, but a hungry werewolf! You would be wise to avoid being accused by them. Get them to accuse someone else. Maybe even accuse someone else yourself. There will one villager amongst them known as the Seer. Each night the Seer gets to learn the true identity of one villager of their choice. The moderator will tell the seer whether their chosen villager is or is not a Werewolf. The Seer will be attempting to inform the villagers of the knowledge they gain. Since the Seer may eventually find you out, you will want to try and sniff out the identity of the Seer and either get the villagers to accuse them as Werewolves and lynch them, or choose to eat them in the night. The Seer is your biggest enemy. When you and your fellow villagers have together agreed which villager amongst you will accused of being a Werewolf, the accused will be lynched and removed from the game. If the Werewolves can eat or lynch enough villagers to even up their numbers with the current number of Werewolves, then the Werewolves will win the game! If you cannot, then night falls again...

[b]To be read/spoken to Seer:[/b] You are a villager with special powers. During the night you will close your eyes, but while the rest of the village sleeps you will awaken to seek out the true identity of a villager of your choice. When asked to open your eyes, don't stop tapping, open your eyes and point to the villager of your choice. If the villager is a werewolf, your moderator will give you a thumbs UP. If the villager is not a werewolf, your moderator will give you a thumbs DOWN. You will then close your eyes again. When your eyes are again closed, the werewolves will eat one of your fellow villagers, maybe even you! When the new day dawns and you open your eyes, a villager will be dead. The villagers, along with your help, will begin trying to determine which among you is not actually a peaceful villager, but a hungry Werewolf! The villagers will need your assistance, but be clever and careful. The Werewolves fear the Seer. Should they learn your identity, they will most likely eat you. When you and your fellow villagers have together agreed which villager amongst you will accused of being a Werewolf, the accused will be lynched and removed from the game. If the villagers can lynch all of the Werewolves before they can even up the number of Werewolves to villagers then the villagers will win the game! If you cannot, then night falls again...

[b]To be read/spoken to Villagers:[/b] You are a villager. During the night while you close your eyes, the werewolves will eat one of your fellow villagers, maybe even you! When the new day dawns and you open your eyes a villager will be dead. With the aid of your fellow villagers you must determine who among you is not a peaceful villager, but a hungry werewolf! To aid in the inquisition of the werewolves, there is also one villager amongst you known as the Seer. Each night the Seer gets to learn the true identity of just one villager. You should heed the Seer's words. But who is the Seer? If the village finds out then surely the Werewolves will eat the helpful Seer next! So be careful in your inquisition of the werewolves. When you and your fellow villagers have together agreed which villager amongst you will be accused of being a Werewolf, the accused will be lynched and removed from the game. If the villagers can lynch all of the Werewolves before they can even up the number of Werewolves to villagers then the villagers will win the game! If you cannot, then night falls again...

[b]Preamble[/b] - [i]to kickoff the game and to help get the suspicious juices flowing:[/i]
"But how well do you really know your fellow villagers? If one o' them snuck off in the middle of the night to howl at the moon and preyed upon the unsuspecting rest of us, would you know which one? Which one of your fellow villagers is a Werewolf? How are you going to find out?  You must be quick, the village is in danger and the danger must be stamped out before more of you are eaten! Find the werewolves and lynch them!"

[b]First Day Only[/b]
The first day the villagers will awaken to find their dear moderator has been slain by the hungry Werewolves. We will proceed around the room as each villager states: "Hello my name is ______ and I am not a Werewolf."


[b]Prodding the participants, especially in the beginning[/b]
Then if someone needs prodding, prod them asking, "Who do you think is the werewolf?" "Why do you think HE/SHE is the werewolf?" Really try to get those deep seated feelings of suspicion and mistrust out in the open. This is what makes the game fun!

For a game of bluffing and second guessing, you cannot go past this game. I enjoy playing it online more, but that's probably due to having nobody to play it frequently with otherwise. But it forms my addiction to this website, so it cannot be dismissed lightly. This game is addictive due to its social interactive component.

An unbelievably entertaining experience filled with tension, intrigue, and plenty of "aha" moments.  The rules are extremely simple; we play with only the "werewolf" and "seer" roles and I don't think I'd even consider adding any more; this has the perfect pace as-is.  An amazing social experiment and an even better game, and it's *free* to play!  Have already had some hilarious moments playing this with my classes.  Takes a whack of people to play, but would I realistically ever turn a game down if I had enough people to play it?  The answer is no.  (I have only played this with 20+ so far)

The social game in the highest grade, Werewolf never fails to appeal both gamers and non gamers, constantly screaming through endless, loud, chaotic plays: as simple and random as it is, Werewolf is a party favourite of most gamers and non-gamers alike I know and play with. (October 2011)

[b]Update[/b] - As any social game, Werewolves’ success or failure depends on the group you are playing with: actually, if some players aren’t fully cooperating they are also preventing the others from having a good time, which results in poor, almost boring games.

Yet if everyone is willing to have fun, the whole game greatly benefits from this positive attitude: as a result, Werewolves immediately lifts off and makes for one of the most fun and enjoyable social or party games a large group can experience to have a memorable game day.

This is the reason why in October 2013 I decided to raise my rating to 8.

The classic version, a simple deck of role cards.  Werewolves, Villagers, and a Seer.  We've played this so much, the cards are near unusable now, lol.  Everyone should experience Werewolf at some point.  Replaced in our group now by Ultimate Werewolf (more roles) and One Night Werewolf (no player elimination & a free phone app that does Narrator job for you).

I'm mostly interested in the original Mafia, by Davidoff. 
- It seems more organic.
- The mafia members have to, independently, attack the same person, or else the assassination fails. That offers more "material" for the townsfolk to work with, as the mafia has to try to come to an agreement during daytime. The mafia becomes stronger with less members. And it seems nothing prevents them from attacking their own members, causing confusion, with the risk of actually killing themselves.
- Townsfolk can lynch more than one during daytime, and that comes as a blessing and a curse. If they lynch two people, and one was mafia, they won't know which person it was. And, in the scoring variant, they might go on killing townsfolk even after all mafia are dead, reducing their score.

F2F: I will always play, don't see that changing. Our group approaches this as a filler game, which is too bad. It seems I'm an early wolf target, which has become a bit of a bummer for me...but I'll always play!

BGG: The variations and themes presented here on the geek are fantastic. I've played the following 'versions:' Neuromancer, Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, a D&D version, Ender's Game, Settlers of Catan, LOTR and lots of silly little games too. There is almost always a game using the basic mechanics going on for the uninitiated... It doesn't feel right if I'm not playing in at least one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
As an introduction to gaming, or a social romp for experienced gamers, little else can compare. This can be such a powerful game. It's exceptional at almost tricking people into playing by being so simple for the players (like codenames). And I love playing it with experienced groups, its a true versatile beast great for ANY group of 10 or more. Despite its warts (player elimination, group dependency) this game continues to fascinate me and is still king of the genre. I dont play too often, but I also don't have to, it always feels like an old friend. Personally my advice is never buy, always make your own set (but Bezier's editions are all lovely).

EDIT: Played again recently... man, played elimination is a bummer. My previous thoughts still apply... but only in the best of circumstances. Too uneven for too many people. Rating dropped.

I own the DaVinci version. After the first games I rated it a 7,5 but now after many (may be too many) games I feel a bit tired.

Anyway, not so many games may host up to 23 players and that's definitely a good thing. The bad thing is that you can be eliminated from the game even in the first turn even if there is not a particular reason; it's hard to accept them; I play games because... I want to play (I don't want to sit watching other doing what I cannot do anymore...!)

I played this a lot with bigger and smaller groups and I have played so many versions of this with lots of different roles. The main issue is the player elimination in the first rounds.

I dunno, there didn&#039;t seem to be an actual game here, other than picking on the unpopular people. For several rounds there is no actual information on who to accuse, so it&#039;s not really a negotiation game, you really just try to bully people into killing someone else. In the end, it mainly seems to boil down to not killing off your buddies. In the long run, it&#039;s possible to glean *some* information based on who the werewolves off and how people angle discuss who to kill if you are exceptionally observant, but really very little (or, you can go for the method of just listening to see who moves when the werewolves are summoned by the gamemaster - now there is a real man&#039;s game. Oh wait, no there isn&#039;t). Given all this it just doesn&#039;t seem like a game to me, at least not one for adults. Celebrities and Apples to Apples were fun adult party/social games which I enjoyed a lot; this isn&#039;t.

I've played a game called Mafia which is exactly the same, but roles are determined by handing standard playing cards to everyone.  Can be "played" for free since the contents of the game are not necessary for game play.  The "game" is an extremely boring guessing game, which essential is just a popularity contest.  If the citizens guess right, they win, if they don't, they lose.  The "game" might work as a social mixer, but really isn't good for anything else.

It is fun to play with a large group where everyone knows everyone else quite well, but fun depends largely on the social skills of players.

Gameplaywise I love how the uncertainty due to the villagers not knowing the who the werewolves are, mixed  with the necessity to murder one player every day, creates the atmosphere for this game that can sometimes feel like it is leaving the realm of game and veering into social psychology territory or into a commentary on modern anti-muslim reactions in the US, anti-Japanese reactions in North America during the second world war, or communist hunts in the 50s and 60s

As it is a public domain game, I play it with a set of werewolf, villagers, and seer cards that I printed out myself.

Werewolf is an okay activity game, but I would always prefer to play ONUW! However, regular Werewolf plays many more people, and I've taken it to work to play with 12-15 colleagues who have all enjoyed it a lot, and on the other hand they don't care much for ONUW. So I think that for large groups and nongamers, the original Werewolf game is still a good game to play from time to time. It's just not any fun for me after I've played ONUW and Resistance etc., which has so much more social deduction, so regular Werewolf always feels a little bland to me. This is why I'm happy to just be the moderator in this game (another thing which sucks; it's just a bad design when one person can't really play along).

A game very dependent on the group of players. The player elimination and lack of any real information on which to base your votes don't make for much of a game.

When I am in the write mood and have enough people (or can't find anything for that many people to do), this game works fine. 

I got the cards because the novelty of it all, but a standard playing deck of course works just as well.

The fun factory depends highly on who is playing, and who are the werewolves. When done right, this game is a lot of fun. Other times, it is just a mildly entertaining time killer.

RATING: 4
Werewolf is an exceptionally difficult game to rate. In many ways, it is more of a social role playing experience than it is a game of the type that I typically play, and it varies a lot based on whether it's played in-person, online, and if online, based on the theme of the game.

In person it's all about reading people's tells, knowing their play style and the like. Online, I think of it more as a pure role-playing experience. With the proper theme it can be exceptionally fun, though again, as a game per se, it's really more of an entertaining activity. Online games with really good themes (ala the Twin Peaks game that ran here) are something that I'm up for on special occasions; other incarnations of the game, not so much. This, despite the fact that I think the real life version functions much better as an actual game based on poker-style psychology and politics.

As others have said, one of the main problems with this game is the early portion, where choices end up being arbitrary. After a few lynch votes and killings patterns can at least emerge, but it's hard to have much of a strategy before a handful of people have already been eliminated. In that sense, I think the online implementation is much better than real life, because it's something that you can just make occasional posts to and enjoy the role-playing element without having to invest the time in one large chunk.

The rating I give this is reflective of my general feelings about it as such. A good theme can sway me to play it, but I find in general it is too meta without enough actual meat until the game is already half over, and a lot of the early decisions, which can matter a lot, are arbitrary. The game, ironically, also suffers when people are too explicit about the meta, in other words, when they break role to discuss what is going on in the game, which makes perfect sense from a trying to win standpoint, but which doesn't fit the experience that well, at all. I also think it's much more of an actual game when you're part of a group, whether good or evil, that actually has some extra information to work with. Generic roles or isolated ones are much less interesting and you're much more likely to end up being the victim of a lynch mob if you randomly choose good people for early votes.

The really depressing thing about this game is that people often don't play the game, they screw around.  If you've sat in a group of finger pointing, nonsense spouting shouters, you've sat through a bad game of this.  Utterly fantastic if played by a group of talented social engineers and experiences phishers.  I prefer to run rather than play.

I love this game!  You don't really need to buy cards to play, but the moderator script does help when playing with new players (that way YOU don't get stuck being the moderator every time, as it's randomized...)

I really love the Werewolves of Miller's Hollow set (or whatever it is called--I have the French version).  I highly recommend laminating the cards of this one--it is worth the effort, especially since the cards are uncoated (or mine were), and so don't hold up well on their own.

Played this a lot in my college days - it was a fun icebreaker for large groups.  We played it under the name "Mafia."  Easy fun - I'd normally jump at the chance to play if asked.

As a game, it leaves a lot to be desired. The acting ability of the werewolves is the only skillful portion of play; dumb luck makes up the rest.

Components: I find it easier to create and customize my own deck for this than to buy an existing deck. To my knowledge, the public-domain game Mafia predates the re-theme of Werewolf, so I find it interesting that all the published versions are Werewolf-themed. Shouldn't somebody be suing somebody over that?

Experience: I can't stand deceiving others; the threat of being dealt a werewolf card far outweighs the joy of being a frightened villager, so I will only play the game as moderator, and as such I am weary of it. It was fun at a certain point in my life, with a great group of people, but I don't need to play this again.

I enjoy the Werewolf PBF Forums here on BGG. They are using Werewolf as a base game and creating their own games around it. I don't care for straight werewolf, but I like the werewolf games with the Cassandra movement system involved like the Die Hard game. I'm not sure it's really still werewolf, but that's what they call it.

An unbelievably entertaining experience filled with tension, intrigue, and plenty of "aha" moments.
The rules are extremely simple.
You really need more than "vanilla" roles that to keep things spicy and varied and lively. Otherwise you risk complacency.
I've regretted joining games of it before, to be honest, and they were groups of the boring basic set with players who I did not know who were complacent and would not actually play the game. I still love the game, but much like taking your chances with the easy ones at a bar, it isn't always the amazing fun I hope it to be.

Werewolf is very fun, but only with the right group of people. Just like it's namesake, it can be two very different entities... either an extremely fun and interesting social game, or the cause of many arguments, hurt feelings, and super-meta-gaming. BE SURE YOU KNOW THE GROUP. Still, be well prepared for unexpected results. Sensitive people, sore losers and gloating winners should not participate.

Admittedly I haven't played this on-line and, given the popularity, there must be something in it.
Played live, it was a pretty cool party game, but the elimination aspect is a letdown. It also requires a robust crew... it only takes one wheedler who takes a lynching personally to ruin a game for all.
There's also something vaguely uncomfortable about a game which is won by the player who's best at boldly lying to all their friends.

I think I discovered Werewolf in 2013 watching Dice Tower videos. I been gaming since the 80's and don't think I heard of Werewolf. If it reached my perimeter, I didn't know what it was or ignored it. So in Dec of 2014, I decided it looked interesting, I ordered a fan made version from Cowcow, but it sat for a month or 2 untouched until the end of February, when I went to a game convention (the 1st since I expanded myself into the hobby), and learned One Night Werewolf in the morning and Ultimate Werewolf at night.

I took my copy and introduced it to my gaming friends about a month later, unsure how well it would go over. It was an immediate success.

It has taken off within my circle, my friends, as well as being introduced to my family, extended gamily, was asked to bring it camping on Memorial weekend, everyone seems to love it, gamers and non gamers alike.

Such a great game.  This is a game I can look forward to playing anytime I am with people I enjoy.  My biggest gripe is that people get eliminated.

Essentially a party game.  Two players are werewolves, one player is moderator and the rest are villagers.  When all the villagers are 'sleeping' the werewolves silently agree on who to eat.  When daylight comes, all surviving players agree on who to lynch as a suspected werewolf.  The game ends when both werewolves or a certain number of villagers are dead.  No game here, but a good "get to know you" icebreaker for large game groups.

I think this is one of the best group/party games out there.  It is so easy to play and can really dig into social interactions.  It's a strange mix of role-play, yet not so much that people who don't like acting find themselves too inhibited.  It opens everybody up and provides a great time.

Used to play a lot online, the way the people on that site had a pretty formulaic approach to each game that tended to bring every game down to a 50/50 shot on the last day makes me wary of this game. Once you know these strategies it becomes frustrating to play with people who don't, when you do it's frustrating that it's pretty much luck... Haven't played it at the high convention-style player counts but then I think that exacerbates the player elimination problem and I would want to play Two Rooms and Boom...

[b][thread=530216]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "Werewolf"[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]54[/b] plays) The original hidden role game of misdirection, bluffing and all-around obfuscation. I prefer the lightning-fast [thread=30034]5-player variant[/thread], which condenses all the tension and suspense of the original. The only drawback would be that games can get pretty intense, and new, shy, or mentally exhausted players can feel prohibitively overwhelmed. 

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] It's still good... but I would rather play [GAMEID=41114].

Awesome social game.  I gave away the Looney Labs version, since I have two other editions.

A great role-playing party game.  Drawback: player elimination.  I have the "[gameid=63539]" edition from DaVinci, which (like "The Werewolves of Millers Hollow") has fun additional character roles, as well as the ""Ultimate Werewolf"" edition from Bezier.  Can be played with regular playing cards, where it's also played under the name "Mafia".

Editions: 
Looney Labs successfully marketed a commercial version of the game as [i]Are You a Werewolf?[/i], which was later followed by Asmodee Editions' [i]Werewolves of Millers Hollow[/i], Mayfair Games' [i]Lupus in Tabula[/i] and Bezier Games' [i]Ultimate Werewolf[/i].

Status: Given away as part of the Great Games Giveaway.

I really like the plain vanilla Werewolf, however it seems to work best as a simple party game with people who don't know each other (or at least don't know before starting to play).

For purposes of logging plays, this will serve for Mafia or most homebrew or commercial variants. Only Ultimate Werewolf will be excepted from this.

Played again reluctantly, still don't enjoy it. But I also played as the caller, and I may only play that role in future.**** I have Lupus. I've played one of the other variants. It is an interesting group game, but it is a negative, elimination game. You kill people. The werewolves kill at night, the villagers lynch by day, and all the killing is done by silently pointing in a largely arbitrary way. When you dead, you're out of the game, with nothing to do but watch. French, Italian, Dutch and US publishers, but no German publisher. It is not a german-style game.

Great party game. And it's free (you can make the cards yourself or use ordinaray playing cards, I have used cards from Bohnanza). It's fun and everyone seems to love it at the first sight but you can get bored at it after you have played too many times. I recommed that you experiment with different rule sets because after repeated plays, Werewolf seems start to repeat itself. At least with our base rules werewolfs seems to win all the time but most of the variants seems to give too much power to the villagers.

Most of the time, we play with witness. It adds a whole new element to the mix.

RATING: 4
[Political, Negotiation, Group Dynamics] [I own The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow. Why do I own a game that I rate a 4? Because it's good as a social experiment, just not as a game.] {12+P:4 conditional, it can be good - 6? 7? - with the right group and mood; Forum Werewolf:3} BTW, 60 minutes? You have to be kidding. With 12+ players this is a two-hour affair, minimum. Imagine the chaos with 20 opinionated, vocal ROLEplayers. It's amusing, confusing and scary all at the same time. Anyway, not bad as a social thing, but with my group this normally degenerates into a discussion of what method the villagers will use to determine who gets lynched. There are usually better things to do with our gaming time. However, Werewolf has the singular ability to stretch to 20 people, making it the game of choice as I don't know anything else that can handle that many players. So, it will get played at parties. Sure, I'll play once in a full moon. At least when I get eliminated (tends to happen early) I can grab the next two or three people who get lynched and we can play another game. Or, I can be the moderator, which suits me just fine. Still, it's a social experiment first (how do you know someone's lying?), and it stretches the definition of being a "game". *** UPDATE: Two games of Forum Werewolf (i.e., Werewolf played on message boards) result in the same experience. The optimal strategy to win is to distill the situation into a numbers game, taking any special role powers into consideration. In this manner, a win or loss can be predicted with pretty good accuracy. However, the atmosphere of the game breaks down in the eyes of many (personally, it's not an issue). Therefore, in order to maximize enjoyment of the game, an analytical player can be forced to play sub-optimally. Therefore, Werewolf in this form is borderline broken from a game perspective, especially when more roles beyond the base three (wolf, seer, villager) are added. It remains an interesting study in behavior, as much as might be derived from a message board anyway. Forum Werewolf rating: 3 (close to broken, but not quite)

a must-know game for my group because a few of them love this game so much. I don't think there is a simpler game that I have played with everyone, but the social aspect of determining who's a liar and trying to hide as a liar can be fun once you get the hang of game play. It's frustrating the first few times otherwise. My best recommendation when playing this the first time is to pick a role other than the one you are assigned and run with it. Just don't claim to be evil..

RATING: 8
Loads of fun. Never disappoints. I've used Magic: The Gathering cards for the roles with excellent results. The werewolves are black cards and all the villagers are white cards. I also used Ultra-Pro deck protectors to extend the life of the cards because they can get fairly man-handled in the heat of the slaughter. Here is my set:

2 Treacherous Werewolf - Werewolves
1 Sanctum Custodian - Moderator
1 Vigilant Sentry - Seer
1 Troubled Healer - Healer
1 Aysen Bureaucrats - Villager
1 Benalish Missionary - Villager
1 Charm Peddler - Villager
1 Mtenda Herder - Villager
1 Revered Elder - Villager
1 Royal Herbalist - Villager
1 Samite Alchemist - Villager
1 Samite Pilgrim - Villager
1 Silent Attendant - Villager
1 Tragic Poet - Villager
1 Volunteer Militia - Villager

Of course, all of these are easy to find, common cards and are taken from the "black-bordered" expansion sets. Any comments would be welcomed, especially suggestions for any of the variant roles.

Werewolf is essentially Mafia formalized with cards.

This game is the ultimate in affordable. Just a few designators of who the werewolves are and the seer and away you go. :)  It's a fun enough game with a large group but it has to be a group that likes to ham things up a bit and would wear thin if it were played regularly. The plethora of variants should help keep this fresh and playing with a new set of victims.... er.... players would be a big big plus. I like the game, but I wouldn't want to play it without a fairly large group and wouldn't want to play it too regularly. That said, I'm sure I will play this again many many times in the future.

DaVinci's Lupus in Tabula deck has a number of annoying or broken roles, the symbols on the cards are confusing, hard to read, and so small that they effectively cannot be taught to a group -- you have to show each card to each player individually. The variable art also tends to create a lot of false meta, both as people try to describe their cards or claim to have a particular villager card, and as new players look longer at the harder-to-read cards (and then get accused of having a special role).

The Looney labs edition is so stripped down and cheesey that I fail to see the point of using it instead of a deck of playing cards.

Werewolves of Miller's hollow is the only deck I prefer to a standard deck of playing cards.

[Apr 09] [Rating: 3]
I’m not too fond of this as a game, but it can be occasionally fun. It’s a game of role-playing and psychology, where you have to guess what people are based on what they say and how they say it. What I find more interesting after the game is to talk about how people reacted and why.

[Oct 09] [Rating: 3]
The only way I want to play this game is face to face though. I see a lot of games by forum, but you have less go on there and it is purely based on voting tactics.

I have some other problems with this game and that is player elimination and that the game can drag. On the other hand, if you move too fast you won't have anything to base the decissions on, so it's basically a hopeless situation for me.

Tendency: I don't expect it to either go up or down. I respect the game, but it's really not for me.

Good for parties when you want something different than the typical party game. I prefer the role system in something like Bang! where the main goal is not just deduction. Also, games that need a storyteller in general lose some appeal right off the bat. Games like Battlestar Galactica, The Resistance, etc. have basically made this game obsolete for me. It's not bad, but I'd usually just pick one of its succesors, similar to how I feel about Risk.

This is a riot with the right group of people.  The key to this game is making sure you get a lively debate going when it comes time to pick who to lynch.  A great game for those situations where you have a lot of people.

Having read about this game here on the 'geek', I introduced this to our friends and it is especially popular with the kids. We've never played it the the 'proper' cards, we just make up a 'pack' by pulling cards from a regular playing card deck. Now I've got 'Resistance' this will almost certainly 'lose out'.

A fairly interesting game for a LARGE group.  Can be rather boring and long if you are one of the first to be killed...  Else, it's a game of deduction, suspicion, and if you're a WereWolf, you support whomever's accusations to add oil to the fire!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A pretty cool party game that is half social experiment and half deduction exercise. It's fun if everyone's into it, but if not... watch out. One uninterested player can drag it down. I think I prefer face to face to the online version as seen here on BGG.

Years later, I generally avoid this. I think Werewolf is fun enough once in a great while, but I know too many people who obsess over it. It sucks in players for hours on end who might otherwise be willing to play something good, which kind of makes me hate it.

One of my all-time favorites. I played online WW (and even moderated a few well-received games)  here on the 'Geek for a good long while before I had to give it up--it's unique, highly addictive and (unfortunately for my schedule)  time-consuming. The parlor-game version of this is really fun, when you've got enough people.

Played online at Cassandra.  It was surprising how this game can be very effectively played online.  This is a great bluffing game.  It reminds me of a line from Dune, "lies within lies within lies."  I truly enjoyed myself and won my first game as the Priest.  I don't see how this can be a complaint, but my problem was that I was so drawn into the game that I was neglecting my responsibilities in life.  The online version is very engaging.  So, for that reason I am holding off on playing another game online.  I would LOVE to play this game in person and I'm sure I will get the chance to do so at some point.

Can be a fun party game, though I prefer to have an actual game to base all the accusations on and without that it does seem pretty random if nobody makes an obvious mistake.

Just need to get the numbers together to get this one to the table. Unlikely but I couldn't resist the buy.

*Update* Had a chance to get a bunch of people to play this. It plays well as long as people are OK with dying and getting kicked out of the game. We decided to play with the ghost variant so that those who were eaten or lynched could still be involved. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves quite a bit. No true strategy, just a big social experiment really.

Looney Labs Version with Modified Cards.

First off, I'm a huge fan of group psychology experiments and sociology in general, so I think I have an immediate biased draw to this game already.  However, I think most will agree that this is the ultimate huge group game to play.  I prefer to add in as many special roles as possible to liven the experience.  Werewolf is so different and original, that it drips with creativity and a welcome invitation to analysis.  I just loves my mass hysteria lynching!

You don't feel like your going to die right away, you can introduce a few more characters without it being chaotic or hard to teach, and even if you do die early it's usually a ton of fun just to spectate and watch it all unfold; especially if you know your in for 3 or 4 games at a party.

The online aspect definitely improves my enjoyment of the game...

This game has grown on me since joining BGG. I used to play this as Mofia in a lot of FHE groups. I thought it was kind of boring there. However, since then I've had the chance to play it with my family and spice the game up a little more with the additional roles. I enjoy it a lot more and can see why so many people enjoy it. Give it a chance again if you've played it only in FHE.

Lots of fun with big groups. It's a little unfortunate that we have to just kill someone at random at the beginning, but I find being able to watch the game unfold knowing who the wolves are almost as fun as playing.

Would really like to build a nice copy of this, some nice cards/tiles. 

As is, can play with standard deck of cards: take enough non-face cards for each villager, use jacks to represent the werewolves, deal out to each player.

really like this game... even the downtime if/when killed is fun.  If getting too long, the moderator should time each round: "Night time is falling, if an agreement can't be made, then nobody will be lynched" type of thing.

Pretty fun interactive elimination game but you must, must, MUST have the right crowd. The game length varies greatly, small groups tend to run shorter as expected but with large groups the game can a 1/2 hour or 4 hours! The long games are usually fun, especially if you're still playing near the end, but they leave you mentally drained. Great for teens.  Also the Gangster version and Star Wars verison of the game are awesome!

My circle of friends plays this as Mafia. I don't know why I bought this deck of cards since we just a normal deck whenever we want to play. We play it where the mafia members are blind and have to "vote" on how to kill at night. If they don't vote for the same person, nobody dies. This makes it much more difficult for them and forces them to try to communicate during the day without tipping off the other players. Now that I've read the rules in this deck, I'm going to try some of the special characters in our next game (re-themed, of course).

Good late night game, as long as the players keep the game moving.  People need enough time to get the feel for what roles people have, but when people are just randomly talking about nothing, it can suck the fun right out of the game for me.  I was enthusiastic about the game at first, then a few bad villages soured me on it and I just wouldn't play for a while.  Now, I'm not back to my initial level of enthusiasm but I will play the occasional game.  More recently, I've been playing in more games with timers of some sort, which helps to keep the game moving.

12/11/09 - I'm new to this game, but it's quickly becoming a favorite. It's a very different 'itch' that this scratches, but it's an itch that I have often. - The game is quick, and everyone is involved.

5/9/10 - I'm now 50+ games into it, and I'm raising my 9 to a 10. This is big for me, as I've only ever had one 10 before (Diplomacy). Werewolf, especially when played with five (Wolf, Sorcerer vs Villager, Hunter, Seer) is quick, gets everyone involved right away (once people have some familiarity with the game), has lots of varied strategies, and is accessible to non-gamers. I will always love this game.

Acquired 2009-10-??... I pretty much made it myself.

Now, any true fan of Diplomacy would see the merits of this game, and I certainly do. It's Diplomacy in an hour, with a huge crowd. 

That said, I find it very repetitive, and its educational value does not add enough to balance how mean it can be. It also, to me, seems to lack a "final goal"... especially for non-werewolves. If I'm a villager, I won't like playing.

What can I say about werewolf? We play it ALOT. We play at all of my wife's families events, we play at our game days, we play on facebook. I love werewolf. It has the tendency to "kill" the night though, as once you start playing, all other games get tossed to the side.

RATING: 9
Oooh, boy is this good with the right crowd. It's about influencing and deduction, as the innocent villagers try to uncover the werewolves in their midst before they become the wolves' midnight snacks. A few caveats: there's not much game, so analysts looking for complex mechanisms, optimum strategies and the like tend to be put off. Also, with too many introverts playing it can be a non-event as it's more about social interaction than anything else. Finally, people do get knocked out (it's not called werewolves for nothing!), but it's a very quick game and it's still fun to watch the interaction and confusion from the sidelines, indeed as it is if you're the moderator running it. Cheap, too (it's essentially a few cards and the rules). Needs a big crowd.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game is boring, and I find it turns into more of a social 'talking' session rather than playing a game. The group would talk and "disrupt" the players still in the game. I don't care if I ever play it again or not, OR at least I would like try to play it with another group.

Games go like this: 

Q: Are you the werewolf?

A: I am not the Werewolf, eh... because I say so... (that isn't fun!) Round and round we go, with the same answer everytime.

The only reason I played it so many time is because it is part of "gamenight" at someone else's house. I have NO control over what is being played.

Only played online, which offered some tension and a hilariously catastrophic outcome for Team Good. It was interesting to see how intuition and logic both play a part, but having a good hunch and bagging the victory are very different things. And then of course playing on Team Evil will be another experience altogether, where all that's unknown and arbitrary for the villagers is what you have to work with. I can easily see how face-to-face play could have practical pitfalls and lead to negative experiences; online play is not without potential issues (e.g. real or feigned absence in combination with automated deadlines can break the game, to name just one thing), but the advantages should outweigh the disadvantages.

Upped rating after a few more games. There's clearly a ridiculous number of layers to learn here. Still only applies to online play.

Upped rating again. I like this game. I like the community. Still only applies to online play, so not really rated as a board game.

Dropped back to 7 after getting a taste of the bad experiences many low raters are talking about and consequently not playing for a good while. It doesn't matter how many layers there are if you simply don't get to participate because the prevailing meta says to kill off the guy nobody knows or cares about on day 1. I still respect the game but the urge to play doesn't overcome the practical hurdles and expected stress.

One of the most fun party games ever.  You will learn a lot about deception in this simple game.

I think the villagers have a definite advantage.  Each turn there is a 1/8 chance or better of catching one werewolf, at which point the Seer has an excellent chance of pointing out the remaining werewolf allowing the villagers to win, even if she gets eaten that night.

Update:  Played a couple of times now.  There is no reason to play this game instead of Resistance.  If the group is too big, split it up into groups of 7, and play resistance.  Downgrading rating from 7 to 5.

Further update:  There is no point in playing werewolf, The Resistance is better in every single way.

Werewolf is a great social game and, to date, the only game that I've played that not only plays well with 12+ players, but it's also more fun the more you are!

First of all, I must state that I play it casually: truly competitive werewolf play kills the fun for me. I enjoy when a session succumbs to chaos, with some people acting irrationally, driven by vengeance or whatnot. Obviously, as long as all the feelings stay within the game.

A very enjoyable party game. It works great with newbies, particularly if playing with a dedicated deck of cards. You know, one of those version with pretty pictures and explanatory texts.

I consider this a con game, although good for parties too. Would recommend one werewolf for every three-five villagers, depending on what complexity level you're interested in doing.

Deduction party game at it's best.  [See my added thoughts for Ultimate Werewolf.]  The gist of this social-psychological party game lies in learning how to navigate and negotiate a discourse with a mob mentality of villagers (some whom are secretly Werewolves, and some are villagers with special abilities like the Seer, the Hunter, potion-carrying Witch, etc.).  This is totally about social interaction, observation, conversation and group politics with hidden identities.  Trying to determine who is whom is as vital as convincing others you are telling the truth.  It is great to play with the right crowd/friends under the right circumstances (i.e. partying atmosphere at around midnight with a full moon).  Aaaaahhhh-uuuuwwwwwww.....!

Apart from being an impudent ripoff of one of the games-we-used-to-play-when-we-were-kids-and-didn't-need-to-buy-anything-to-do-so (see also: Jungle Speed, Hedbanz, and so on), the theme just bores me, the cards annoy me and gameplay sucks. Starts to get interesting with more than 10 people, about the amount of people that leads to early-kills-getting-tired-of-waiting-for-the-game-to-end starting nagging and haggling, and quite understandibly and justifiedly so. The hype around this one riddles me.

One must be really jaded not to enjoy the social dynamics of Werewolf. Only downside is being the random first victim or being known by your group of player as a "dangerous" player and thus being systematically eliminated early for security reasons. Other than that, Werewolf is pure fun.

The french version "Les loups-garous de Thiercelieux" is not only pretty, it's an excellent improvement over the original game. Especially if you use the extension "Nouvelle Lune".

This is my favorite game. This was my favorite game. This will always be my favorite game. To quote myself from last year:

The reason I love werewolf is because it lets you be someone that you don’t really want to be but have always wanted to see what it’d be like to be. As a member of team good, you can be a police officer, interrogating suspects and trying to stop the murders in their tracks. As evil, you can be a storybook villain, tricking everyone into thinking you’re on their side before triumphing over them. As a neutral, you’re a smooth talking politician, playing both sides in an attempt to further your goals. And the best part is that there’s so much variety. The core game may be the same, but one game you could be typical wolf/village setup, but the next you could be traveling through time, impersonating video and movie characters, or even trapped on a mystical island with monkeys, pirates, ninjas, and zombies.

Silly but fun game that you can play with a deck of cards and non-gamers (but people have to be into it).  If you hold the accusation period to a short period of time, you can play many games and dead people can get back into it in the next round.  Actually, being dead is kind of fun because you see everything going on.  Don't need to buy it, just use a deck of cards.

I honestly don't understand why this game is so much fun. It's ridiculously simple, and during the two hours I just played it none of the other folks I was doing it with ever got serious enough to have some sort of clever bluffing strategy, or some reliable way to suss out who the werewolves really were in the group. But the dramatic charade of guesswork was still crazy fun. I think it's really just  a light, goofy party RPG masquerading as a deduction game.

In my opinion nothing brings a group of people together quicker than a game of Werewolf.  Asking people to choose who amongst them is the liar and deserves to be lynched creates an instant group repartee that can last well beyond the context of the game.

I really wanted to rate Mafia.  Which is almost werewolf but not quite, I haven't played enough werewolf to say what I think of all the other characters they have introduced.  But there is nothing like a good game of mafia.

I've been pleasantly surprised how often Werewolf comes out on game nights. As an eminently portable, all-social party game that's better with large groups -- and that works well even with non-gamers -- it makes a perfect icebreaker, change of pace, or warm-up game.

My group went through a long period where we played at least one game of Werewolf every time we had a board game night -- it's one of the few games we could play with nine people. Now that we have Ultimate Werewolf, this edition has been retired.

Played this game twice. First time I played with 9 players and one moderator. Last night I played with 11 players and one moderator. 

Werewolf is an interesting concept for a game. It's allot of fun sitting around accusing people and trying to figure out who are the werwolves. This is a fun game to play with many people at anytime you have a gathering. If you are looking for a game to play at a Halloween party, Werewolf is a game that you should consider.

There are several versions of this game. One version has the special abilities of the characters written on the cards so players do not get confused as to what they should do during the game. If you have a version of the game that doesn't have the special abilities written on the cards, then I suggest that you have a cheat sheet for new players so they know what their role is if they get one of the special villager cards like the Seer, Sorcerer, etc.

I've loved this game for years.  I meet with a regular gaming group for ultimate werewolf.  It is a lot of fun. 

One issue is the lack of information at the beginning of the game.  The game also tends to punish people who speak out early.  This can mean that the smart players tend to hide into the background at the beginning of the game, which can slow things down.

I think the game is improved with a little role playing.  At the beginning of the game I like to go around the village and have everyone introduce themselves and their "role" within the village.  Even though this information is technically irrelevant for game play, it adds enough to get the game moving at the beginning.  The game is then free to shine in the mid and late game.

I play this mostly online here in the BGG werewolf forum.  This is a great game in RL but it has a whole new twist when playing it online.  

F2F - this game seems more random and just quick fun.  Not too much too it.  
Online - this game has much more depth and uses your brain much more (at least it does for me.) I also love the intersting and creative rulesets and themes uses online, that you just couldn't do in F2F play.

Great game if played with a group of acquaintances.  Our group has played so many times and we know each other well enough that it sometimes only takes one or two rounds of voting before we figure out who the werewolves are.  Almost everyone I have taught this game to loves it.  It&#039;s one of those that people want to play over and over.  The first night we played this game, we went for hours and hardly realized it.  It is particularly fun if you have a CD of Halloween special effects to play in the background.

I'm not that crazy about this one, but it's okay. I enjoy it more if we are more than 12 people. And everybody wants to play a game together, not too long, and relaxing. I still prefer to have 2 tables with 6 players, or 3 of 4. But, for a big group, wanting to play all together, you have this one or Cranium (which can last for hours). So, for a bunch of people wanting to play the same game together, for quick gaming, Werewolf is the one.

I think the biggest problem with this game is that there's no basis (especially early on) from which to make accusations, so the tend to be entirely baseless. There needs to be something to fuel the deductive process.  

I once wrote a much better version of  Mafia, with combat. (Mafia actually had to earn their kills.) Players (Mafia or not) could become more powerful by purchasing weapons. Which players were doing so was public knowledge, so there was an actual basis for making deductions: while players might bulk up to defend themselves, Mafia had to do so in order to be able to make kills.

RATING: 7
Game in a Nutshell: Role-play as eather humans or werewolves. Try to eliminate the other group but only the few werewolves know who's who.

Played as: 8,9,10,12,13,14 player

Pros: My favorite large group game and the king of all games mystery. The player interaction here is tops while game-play moves fast and furious. There's no finer feeling then scanning the eyes of fellow players looking for that sparkle that suggests they're up to something.

Cons: The game almost requires a warm-up match before things heat-up and get interesting. Doesn't do well with quieter people... well it's actually completely dependent on the personalities playing.

Other: I printed out the free version under the games file section (Curse of the Wolfen) which I highly recommend printing and playing before throwing money at a retail version.

Best Use: Bigger gatherings of 10 or more people where you have the time for a couple games.

Quite a tame theme compared to the much better version. Really the setting and reputation of Werewolf ruin the whole experience. While mafia still remains the best game to date, Werewolf falls almost comically short. If you like Werewolf try mafia and you will never go back.

Played once...

I've never actually played Werewolf in person, I gave this copy away because it'd been on my shelf for so long without ever seeing any use.  The only time I'd have a group large enough would either be a convention (where someone else will have it) or I own other games I rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
I'm a terrible liar, and thus I absolutely suck at this game when I'm a werewolf.  I also can't make quick logical deductions while multiple people are making statements that all need to be fed into the logical deductions, and thus suck at this game as a villager.  And when I'm the seer I can't seem to convince people that I actually have useful information. Considering that those are the only three roles, I just plain suck at this game.

I played with 9 people three times, and while it was fun to watch everyone else compete once I had died (and believe me, I died early), there didn't seem to be enough information from cards or roles (i.e., from the seer or people's cards) to make good deductions.  Instead, all the information for decision making is based solely on reading other people and making deductions from those readings, which isn't a mechanic I enjoy (and which, not coincidentally, I'm also terrible at).

Update: I've played more games, and while I don't die nearly as early (my group has learned that they can tell immediately if I'm the werewolf), I'm getting sick and tired of the complete lack of information for the villagers to go on.  Sure, you can try to judge if someone is lying or not, but assuming you've got decent liars as the werewolves, there's simply not enough time in a 6 to 8 player game for villagers to piece together clues to determine who the werewolves are.  The seer can sometimes add information, but beyond obvious slipups that's the only hard data you get to go on (other than voting records, which are tough to track over time and which don't create usable information quickly enough).  The game always turns into a random kill fest, wherein people who are stupid enough to speak up or unlucky enough to look suspicious make themselves targets and have no way to defend themselves.  This random killing goes on until the werewolves win.  yay.  I'm lowering my rating from a 4 to a 2.5 as a result.

As a form of social interaction, this is a halfway decent way to spend some time with friends. As a game, this is horrible.

RATING: 9
This is a GREAT, simple party game that has players trying to find the werewolf(s) hidden amongst the group. It’s a pure negotiation type of game where wild accusations fly! This game is exciting and ALWAYS produces great rounds of laughter and hilarious situations when people accuse or try to defend themselves from the morning lynching. The best part is that it’s VERY EASY to teach and play and it’s practically FREE since you can really play with just a pack of regular playing cards. One negative is that there’s player elimination. However, since the games are so quick there’s really not much downtime for eliminated players. Plus, it’s always fun to sit back and watch the chaos unfold. Another bad thing is that you really need a fairly large group to make this game work. A minimum of 7 players, at least! Otherwise, VERY HIGHLY recommended! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Every time that I am forced to play this game I wonder why I let myself get bullied into it. I can see it working with the correct group by just through together a bunch of strangers and then just randomly lynch someone based on nothing, or maybe because they made an accusation but well it would be a rubbish game if nobody accused anyone. At least when you play one-night you have the nice markers to start placing in front of yourself or others to give some visual representation of the discussion and more importantly there are strict time limits and no elimination. I just don't understand why some people love this so much.

Oh and by the way the mafia theme really makes no sense, the game is far more coherent played as werewolf.

I completely missed the previous incarnations of this game, including Mafia and any public domain offerings.  That said, baby do I have an opinion about this particular release!  :)  

My wife and I are extremely social people.  We have friends from all of the world, many of whom are amongst the funniest, most creative people you will ever meet.  To that end, there is never a dull moment when The Werewolves of Millers Hollow is introduced in a party setting.  Good friends and strong drinks make this a truly incredible experience.  Our last session in particular saw no less than seven different moderators, each with hilarious and engrossing backstories on Millers Hollow, the werewolves, the townspeople, the lovers, and every detail you can imagine.  This from many first-timers.  

In short, if you like hanging out with your friends, then you'll love hanging out with them even more during a game of Werewolves.  Trust me on this one.

This might be the greatest social game of all time.  It's amazing how it works no matter what the group size - I've played with 5, and I've played with 24.  It's always a different experience and always fun.  I'm sure that a bunch of sociologists could have a field day with watching how alliances shift and change.  And it's very cool how often the group can actually ferret out the liar amongst them.  After many plays, I've bumped this to a 10.  (By the way, I own the Miller's Hollow version.)

If you get tired of being killed right away, just volunteer to be the moderator and have fun with that.

This is a great game with the right number of people and the right people. You really need 15 to make it great. The first few rounds are mostly guesses, but then you start to try to read people.

I have played in a game that took hours because people were trying too hard and got really bored, but almost all of my games have been fun.

Awesome party game if you know most of the people in the crowd.  I have seen so much excitement that people have stayed half of the night playing.  I know you don't really need the cards to play but they're nice to have.  I carry this with me in my purse at all times.

RATING: 6
At night, the werewolves kill an innocent villager. At day, the villagers negotiate to lynch one of the inhabitants to hopefully get a werewolf. Werewolves win if they outnumber the villagers and villagers win if they eliminate all werewolves. Played once with 18 others by e-mail and played twice face to face. It's fun, more of a party game, but being eliminated early is a big detriment. I like the mechanism where there are evil players lurking amongst the good players which adds lots of tension and casts suspicion on everyone. Unfortunately, there is no real scientific basis to find the evil players. If there were a better method to judge one on their actions, the rating would be higher, but it is fun.

RATING: 6.5
A social game that can host a large group of people with ease. Most will be villagers but some have a secret identity (a werewolf) that the villagers need to deduce. The game is mostly ridiculous fun as people point fingers at one another and cause a raucous. Best when there is enthusiastic person hosting, who is good at putting some spin and storytelling into the game. Having the extra roles is good (the doctor etc) but the game is too chaotic for me with no real strategy.

Today, I only played Alex Rockwell's posted variant here (https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/30034/how-play-werewolf-less-7-players) for 5P and it was enjoyable, and I'd be willing to play it again. You don't really need werewolf cards (a basic 52 card deck works) but I liked the roles mixup and seeming balance. I did NOT however like the player elimination as it could go on. Only do this if you have stuff to do if the game ends early. This 5P variant's rules are:

"For a 5 player game (plus a moderator), use the following roles:

1 Werewolf. The game is over when The werewolf dies, or if only 1 werewolf and 1 other player remain.

1 Sorcerer. The Sorcerer is on the werewolf team and wins if the werewolf wins. The sorcerer looks like a villager to the seer. During the night, the sorcerer looks at one player, and the moderator tells them if that player is the SEER or not.

The werewolf and sorcerer do NOT know each others identity, and are not permitted to make any sort of signals during the night (when the other had their eyes open and could see it).

1 Seer. During the night, the seer looks at one player and the moderator tells them if that player is the Werewolf or not.

1 Hunter. The hunter is a villager with the following ability: If at the end of the game, the only 2 remaining players are the hunter and the werewolf, then the hunter kills the werewolf and the village wins.

1 Villager.

For a 6 player, add one additional villager.


When a player dies, their role is NOT revealed.

The game begins with a night phase, in which the werewolf does NOT kill a player. The sorcerer and seer look at players. Then day, then night with kill, then day..."

Talk all you want about there being deep psychological strategy to this game - I won't believe you. People are randomly eliminated until just a few players are left. I'll grant you that the end game does require you to have paid attention to the votes throughout the game, but it's still a guessing game. Even with groups that play together often, the only real basis for any decision is past behavior and guesswork. It can be a fun game if you last until the end, but too much of a time waster for me - I'd rather play games that are won or lost based on many of my choices - not those of my fellow players who don't trust me for some unknown (and arbitrary) reason. **UPDATE** While I still agree with my previous comments about the strategic depth of the game, playing with people you know can be very enjoyable as a social game. I had great fun at the 2009 GOF with the regulars!

A fun game to play when you have a large group of non-gamers around. Great for getting to know people at parties, gets people talking. Although the arguments that this isn't a game are sort of valid, it's still a fun activity to do with a group of people as long as they get into it. If people want to try and over analyze this, they are missing the point.

Interesting social negotiation/bluffing game when you have many players (eight or more preferably).

It's good with gamers as well as non-gamers. Lots of variations with different characters.

Update (29.10.2013): The Resistance is werewolf variant I like a bit more than original (that was best so far) since it keeps all players involved during whole game. Thinking about getting that one although I get to play these games pretty rarely nowadays.

This game is amazing. You need nothing but slips of paper and your brain, anyone can instantly pick it up without having ever played it and yet it can turn into something more passionate and heated than a game of Diplomacy. You can never play just one game, it's got the 'just one more game' mentality that leaves you playing until the early hours of the morning. Almost no real rules, infinite variations, pure deception. My favorite game.

The fact that you can be knocked out of the game in the first round for no reason, the need for a "narrator", the incredible potential for rampant cheating, and the arbitrary messiness of it all frustrates me.

Amusing game, great for larger groups. About the only party game that I'll play.

When I was on Jury service I played this with my group in the deliberation room.

The only problems with the game are the lack of information at the start, so it comes down to guessing. If the wolves are good, the final lynching will come down to guessing too. 'Dead' players have to sit and watch, but it's not a very long game.

Un party game le cui origini si perdono nella storia, che la DaVinci ha arricchito con alcuni personaggi speciali, che mettono pepe al gioco. Come ogni linciaggio che si rispetti, per non essere fatti fuori le regole non ti salvano: hai solo la tua retorica. Concludendo, un gioco apparentemente senza pretese, che diventa - oltre che divertentissimo - principale responsabile della perdita della voce. Difficile giocarci con continuità: il numero minimo è di otto giocatori, e dopo la prima partita avrai sulla testa una denuncia per schiamazzi.

I have the Lupus in Tabula edition of this game. It is a classic and favors those with a silver tongue who can convince others what to think. One of my favorite tactics when I am a wolf is to accuse the other wolf until one of the villagers suggests another person. Then jump on with that accusation. The biggest flaw with this game is that it requires 8 or more players to have a good game.

Despite the wonderful experiences it has given me in the past, I think as a social deduction game it is painfully limited and outclassed by new designs.

We have our own variant with home made cards with our own pictures in costumes from photo shooting. That is very nice.

How is this a game? There are no real choices, no real reasons to do anything, no point. Only the Seer can do anything meaningful, and even then it's arbitrary and stupid. Also, what kind of a "game" allows a person to be eliminated before they can do anything (LITERALLY) and then BY THE RULES they must sit there and not talk for the remainder of the game? That's not a game, that's social punishment. I cannot fathom the type of person who would like this game, ESPECIALLY since The Resistance exists, and is basically better than Werewolf in every conceivable way.

Cannot begin to say how little I enjoy this game.  Unlike other large group/party games (I Poo Cat, Pictionary games, charades, word bluffing etc) this one is tedious and usually filled with drunken shouting and attention-seeking.

OK, one doesn't really "own" Werewolf.  My "copy" consists of some Magic: the Gathering Human (villager) and Wolf (werewolf) token cards in opaque sleeves to deal out to players.  Werewolf is a game that's always ready in my backpack because you never know when the opportunity will strike to play it, and *no opportunity to play Werewolf should ever be missed*.  The ultimate game of politics and social engineering, its strategic depth is boundless.

This game is so severely based on who you play with that I can't really give it a 10.

Hidden roles and bluffing make it a great game for friends, but is quite a good game to play as an icebreaker as long as people are willing to discuss things in a polite manner with strangers.

I love this game, in theory. Informed minority vs. uninformed majority, information that you want to communicate to some but keep hidden from others, lying, deceiving, acting, sleuthing, from a (game) theoretical standpoint this may be the greatest game ever created.

And yet I don't really like playing it. I don't like the tension, the frustration, the accusations, the failure to convince others, the having to keep yourself in check so as not to stand out, &c. It's fun, but mostly when it's over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
When the opportunity arrived that 10 people were available, I was reluctant to introduce this game, as I feared it would be so dependent on group dynamics that the experience may fall flat. So long as players can implement tactical "Survivor" style arguments and counter arguments of why someone should be killed and not killed, and the moderator can provoke such styles in players and maintain pace and atmosphere, this game is an interesting mature psychological experience of lies and persuasion. My hesitation was due to lack-lustre experiences with The Big Idea and Once Upon A Time, but in Lupus in Tabula, you're less dependent on being creative to be funny, and more in persuasion. Some confusion as to how the roles work, and I think in future I won't allow a killing on the first night to prevent a totally random murder and give everyone a chance at discussing and lynching, which may favour the villagers too much. I'll have to see. I can see other 'geeks arguments that there are no real clues as to who is who, and hence no real game, but I suspect more competitive 'werewolves' would give more body language/verbal clues. All in all, I've been bitten with the desire to play more games.

First time, first round, I said nothing. 
Someone said: "He's saying nothing. He must be a werewolf".
Me: No.
The others: He's smiling. Let's burn him.
I died.
Then I was out of the "game" for almost one hour, with nothing to do except listening ridiculous arguments.

4 reasons to hate Werewolf:
1) The players accuse others with no reason.
2) Player elimination
3) It's way too long.
4) THE RESISTANCE exists and it's a good game.

I would play this game again only to escape death.

When I think Party Games, I think enjoyable by everyone, and a good socialization tool.  Werewolf fails here.

Any party game that eliminates players WITHOUT quickly returning players into play is an epic fail.

Any party game that requires people to be silent with eyes closed for large portions of the game (when many special roles are used), it is a fail.

If you want to play this game at a party, have something for eliminated players to do.

RATING: N/A
There was a period in my life during which this was THE game. I loved this one more than any other game and constantly thought about it. I played a lot of play-by-forum werewolf on another site, and I'm still in touch with a lot of them. Of course, we called it Mafia, and to me, this game will always be Mafia, but that ultimately doesn't matter.

The GMs on the site I played would write up elaborate stories with clues related to our online personas. This version of the game is fine enough, but when it was my turn to GM, I tried some different things. I probably cooked up 20+ different ways to run a mafia game, and this is where I learned to love GMing. I owe this game a great deal for that.

Eventually, I began to realize the game's flaws. As much as I love the rest of it, player elimination in a game lasting this long really is unforgivable. And once the bad guys learn to play well enough to hide themselves, it's not that difficult to play well. Base Werewolf really is just too boring for me these days. Of course, with the right mods and variants, it can be a ton of fun, but that's beyond the scope of this comment.

Ultimately, I can respect Werewolf for what it is: a flawed game which I no longer enjoy playing, but which serves as inspiration for tons of great games (The Resistance, One Night Ultimate Werewolf [which takes all the best parts of Werewolf and none of the worst], Two Rooms and a Boom, and I'm sure a bunch of future games which haven't even come out yet. This is no longer a fun game, but it will always be a meaningful game to me.

With One Night Ultimate Werewolf, I pretty much never want to play regular big group Werewolf again. Would be extremely dependent on the group...

UPDATE: Played a ton of Werewolf at BGG.con. Big live games are AMAZING.

I haven't played a big game live yet, but I have played a lot of forum/e-mail werewolf and also the 5-6p variant from Alexfrog. It's like gaming crack, but the fixes are free.

Own the Looney Labs edition "Are You A Werewolf?" and my own homemade version.

The combinations of roles and rules on how to handle the gameplay of each phase means that if you play werewolf you don't just have 1 game to play, you have thousands of different games to play. Awesome.

I have played online, and in person.  In person, it is a 8, possibly a 9 (depending on the group). [b]Online, it is a 6.[/b] 
The strength of the game is in the immediate feedback, and quick play (15 minutes) that allows people to attempt to deceive and manipulate people freely. Online, everything is incredibly slow, and the extended deceiving, manipulation and backstabbing over days and days and weeks and weeks weakens the game experience and deepens/elevates the deceitful aspects into damaging levels.
Not a fan of many additional roles - I feel they invariably weaken the gameplay, adding complexity while reducing balance. The only point of adding roles would be to give experienced villagers some extra wrinkle, but only if they didn't really care about balance that much.

I enjoyed the games I was in via online web forums, but I don't know if I would enjoy it as much when playing in person.  I don't think 1) I would be able to lie well in person.  2) I would be as diplomatic and forgiving in person if a player got out of line with the group or any one person in it, or the whole game collapses into over-emotion.  

I don't think I will play over the web forum very often, either, because playing just one game takes a great deal of group time organization and commitment.  

So it's too long to play over the net, which is the best way to play it in order to avoid the problems I can imagine with playing a shorter live game.

this is a great party game. this is, however, only good to play with people who posses some amount of social skills and who are also not thin skinned. better with as many people as you can muster and an experienced moderator. i find that werewolf is a much more thematic, and therefore, rewarding version of this game. trust me. recently i got a bunch of people to play werewolf, who had only ever played mafia before, and they all remarked at how much more they enjoyed werewolf because of the theme.

I really think this game is a big draw for the boys to attend trips. Just great fun.

I went through college playing "Mafia" ... a form of Werewolf.  This is a great game, especially for large groups.  The rules I play by include some differences:

-We always have both a sheriff and a medic
-A players role is *NOT* revealed when they are killed
-The more people we have, the more roles I add in to give people something to do, including freemasons, the mystic, and the deputy, while still balancing the game so that it is not weighted in favor of either the mafia or the citizens.

I would say 95% of the time I'm playing this game, I'm the moderator.  This is usually because I'm the one explaining the game, and it works best with a moderator who knows what's going on.  I don't really mind moderating, I enjoy watching the game play itself out.  Now that I've moderated a fair number of games (over 30) it's interesting to see the same arguments play themselves out (whether to execute someone the first day, how to handle whether to reveal your identity) and I also enjoy seeing new players come to strategies and putting them into play (such as the sheriff safety gambit).  Sometimes after moderating 3 or 4 games for a group, one of the other experienced players will moderate so I can play, and invariably I am either murdered or executed on the first day!

We played this to death when I used to live in Philadelphia, when I left Werewolf was a five.  However, if you play with different groups from time to time, it revives the game.  I like the basic game with just the villagers, werewolves, and the seer as opposed to the many additional roles.

One of a series of games where there is little mechanic other than "who will be the first one to accuse someone of something over which they have no control?"

A very popular talking and deduction game. How rich the resources a player has depends on how much and well he/she talks. Deduction is less important because there is no identity revealing, and everyone here likes to hide the truth. In conclusion, the Werewolf is only a talking game. But, if you like talking, why not just... talk?

While this "game" is about bluffing and deduction, I found that in practice those who spoke first and best invariably attracted suspicion, no matter what they said or why they said it.  It made for a strange dynamic that's not wholly positive.  Werewolf is a social activity, but not much of a game, really. 

This game does get bonus points for scaling to (essentially) as many players as you have.  That's a boon for any collection.

Who are the werewolves?  I'm not one, but then why is everyone trying to lynch me as one?  No matter what I say, they don't believe... uh oh...

Known to high-school and college students the world over as Mafia. One of the most overrated games on BGG.

Fun in the right crowd, but hard to find it, as you need to know the people well, play repeatedly, and they need to be somewhat interested. Long game length and player elimination are major negatives. In near ruin due to too many rules variants all over the place (ratios, reveals, roles and combinations thereof) ruining the delicate game balance. Not much fun at all if you're not werewolf/mafia, yet if you try to introduce variants to give villagers special roles, you confuse half the group. Would rather play Shadow Hunters or some other deduction game with more structure.

Nice stories at the end, though only the ones where I was mafia are memorable to me.

Played with well-chosen special roles, this is an excellent game of bluffing, deduction, reading people and convincing them of your allegiance.

It's really more of a game system than a game. You can play it face to face, or play it online, and it works amazingly well in both arenas. There are also a huge number of variations possible by using different roles. 

Werewolf is the kind of game that one can enjoy playing over and over again, without it ever getting old.

Still the best this subgenre has to offer (including the likes of Resistance and so on). I do however play with a specific variant of it:
 
[b][filepage=16562]Curse of the Wolfen variant [file][/filepage][/b]
What's different: 
1. No player elimination. Ok, characters are eliminated, but players stay in the game as dead ghosts, which have limited power, but are allowed to talk. 
2. No role reveal. 
3. Specific 2 rounds voting. Everybody, even the dead, can nominate people for hanging - 2 of them get to the final vote. In 2nd round only people alive can vote.  

Another specific of the way we play is that I added some special characters (the Mayor and the little boy) and as moderator I enforce one very specific local setting all my players are familiar with (villages in Alpine region of slovenia in 1920s).

Usually played with 9 to 15 players.

This was pretty much a total fail for my group of friends. They just could not grasp the concept. Every turn they'd just stand there and... stare at each other. Unless I absolutely forced them to interact, and even then you could tell everything they said was very, very forced. Doubt I'll ever be trying it again.

Yes, we all know that this can be played with a deck of cards.

A pure psychological game that hinges on 1) Good moderation and 2)Good player dynamics.

I've seen alot of games where quiet people are lynched for simply being quiet. Even when they are going to be lynched, they have no desire to 'prove' their innocence. Conversely, people who talk too much get lynched too!

Having said that, I've seen and also been a victim of games where players take acting to a whole new level. Good with large groups.

After playing this game a few times at a party, I made my own set of cards and have played a few more times since then. This is a very good party game, if you have at least a dozen players, as long as you have some players who really get into the persuasion and manipulation aspects of the game. With a less social group of players, this game can feel excessively random and arbitrary, and just limps along.

But it has been the source of many hours of play, some moments of supreme tension, ending in joy and despair.

This is single-handedly my top favorite game to play. I will take any opportunity to play. If I forget my game cards, I'll make my own on paper napkins.

Good party game which I'm getting a little bored of. It's great with a big group and can be extremely funny, but all the things I like about it are related to the players themselves and not the actual game.

It's at its best as an ice-breaker type activity or something to do in the pub.

I printed out a copy of the cards for this game from BGG, so the price was great!  Gameplay can be fun if the players are willing to do some negotiation and deduction.  If they just use "mob mentality," it tends to spoil the fun.  The first person out is kind of screwed in this game, but it moves along pretty quickly, even with a huge group, so you should be back in the next game soon.  Not a good game to play if you are the "unpopularest" person in the group!  I have played a couple of games of WW online at BGG and find it to be very tense and exciting and addictive.  One could easily waste hour after hour reading and posting on an online game (right Agnespoodle?).  It is entertaining, but I have to admit that I am not all that good at the nuts and bolts analysis required to be a WW professional.

When I was first exposed to this game I knew it as Mafia.  This was during a time when I didn't know very many gamers and as much as I loved it, I had a very difficult time getting big groups together to play this.  As I grew older and parties became more intimate, more talky and less raucous it was easier to get a game going.  Upon discovering the Asmode version, the art and the new Werewolf theme made this a very likely choice with large groups at the end of a tough night of eating and drinking.

The only real complaint that I have is that I find the first round a little flawed.  It is mostly arbitrary who gets whacked in the begining, unless someone cracks under the presure.

This is a fun lively game that keeps people wanting to come back for more and changes dramatically depending on the personalities involved.

Werewolf/Mafia is a social experience. At that, it succeeds brilliantly. For the werewolves/mafia, there's nothing better than bluffing your way to victory. But player elimination can be frustrating for some, especially early on, so it's hard to rate it higher. Still, with a good moderator and a big group, there isn't much else I'd suggest.

RATING: 10
Since the game requires atleast 8 players, the first time I pulled the game out I actually had to BEG several people to just give me 20 minutes to try the game.  After 20 minutes no one wanted to quit.  Infact, within the hour we had 16 people playing.  Everyone had a great time.  We ended up playing that first time for 2 1/2 hrs; laughing hysterically the whole time.  If you can get atleast 8 people together you must try this game!!!  (Although I think it is best with a minimum of 10 players.)  FYI There are other versions of this game out there that can accomodate even more than 16 players.  I have since bought Lupus in Taluba to accommodate larger groups.

A fun party game of deception where players, along with the help of a moderator, take on the role of villagers, a seer, and 2-3 werewolves. During the night the seer attempts to gain knowledge as to the identity of the werewolf.  The werewolf then secretly chooses a player to devour and eliminate.  The remaining players then take a vote to cast one of the remaining players out of the game.  If the werewolf is not discovered, then the winner(s) are the last 2 remaining players. With this game the more players the merrier. There are several ways to actually play this game without a moderator.

If you have enough people.  There's nothing better than this.  I love the 5 player game, i'd like to try some 7 player rolesets, plus 9-13 players is great too.  Much beyond that, the game changes, but it is still alot of fun.

As far as the version of cards, the Looney Labs cards are horrible, the Lupus in Tabula cards are nice.  But I typically write text on them which clearly state the roles, plus, you have to mix several decks, or it's possible to have villager claims that are too specific on the cards.  (e.g.  I'm the lady villager with the sickle.)  After you get two or three decks mixed together, these are no longer viable claims.

UPDATE: See Ultimate Werewolf: Ultimate Edition...  Those cards are now the set to buy.

People have mixed feelings about this game, and I understand why. It is nothing subtle. It is unguided and unfriendly. It promotes lying and distrust. As a social experiment, it is highly intriguing. Some may even refer to it as more of an activity than a game. 

But for me, this is not only the most exhilirating and fulfilling game, but the greatest one. It is a pure exercise in social deduction, one that allows for more tension and depth of play than its lighter counterparts. It has no distraction of a board. Players are judged entirely on their play, and their contribution to the game. 

Werewolf (or Mafia as I know it as) has created its own glossary of terms, almost a new language, to describe the various complex strategies and nuances of play that can be employed. 

There is a freedom to Werewolf that is refreshing. But it is not directionless. An entire wordbank of meta exists that weaves itself through every game, as games of now and of the past affect future ones. Player interaction is high, team work is integral, communication is rich and paramount. Deception is bound by few limits. 

It can be played anywhere, at any time, with various different mediums. The dimensions of the game change depending whether it is played in person or virtually (you cannot read one's body language through a computer) but this just makes for different and varied experiences. 

Werewolf can be a very intense, gruelling experience. But this makes for a more rewarding and engaging experience. Trying to survive, trying to outfox, or trying to hunt, convince and eliminate - rallying others, co-ordinating with those you trust, or hope to, even those you may disagree with or even dislike - victory will be a hard task, but when it is obtained, the catharsis is unrivalled by any other experience I've had in gaming.

Admittedly, this game is really only as good as the group with which you play, but with the right group this is one of the most amusing, phychology-based games going.

RATING: 6
(+~10 Plays before I started counting)

Best party game for specific situations, like when you have a large party and people are hardly known to each other. The game works both for the players that struggle to survive, and for those who were eliminated and now get to know each other.

Not good with well-connected groups. Player elimination always works negatively then.

Great game of secret roles, bluffing, and deduction. The 7 score is variable. With a good to great moderator this game is a 10. With a mediocre to bad moderator this game is a chore. If you are going to moderate a game, please read some tips online or from your friendly neighborhood game store.

Werewolf can be interesting with the right group and without too many different roles/variants being used.  If you have enough people, like 8-10 people or so, then it's worth trying out, although usually I'd rather split into smaller groups and play something a bit heavier.

A game that can be played with a crowd with very little in the way of components is a wonderful thing, and this game is really a hoot. Still, the game is mostly random guesses and mob mentality, the resistance adds a little more to go on.

This is an OK party game with lots of player interaction. It requires some acting/deceiving skills if you are a werewolf, which gives me a handicap from the start. This may work better with alcohol.

Played a 21-player game at BGG.Con '06 and it left me flat.  I'm guessing it was all the downtime due to conjecture during the daylight phase.  The moderator kept threatening to speed things up, but never did, which would have made this too-long game a little more tolerable.

Most of these plays were 7-8 players where I moderated and only three roles.

This is THE party game.  I love anything with bluffing, and though I'm a terrible liar, this is about the only game where I can play 10 times in a row and want to play again.  Plus it really says a lot about mob mentality and the way a group of people interacts.  One of my favorite games.

I've played a lot of this on forums. The tricky thing is that longer games are better (less random and more skill-based, and with more interesting developments and deductions) but they also mean you have to play longer. I find being a werewolf very hard and increasingly hard as the game goes on. So I basically quit playing.

Rating is for face-to-face which I consider an inferior game but probably more tolerable to play, if that makes sense.

You mustn't care whether you live or die if you want to have fun at this. You can be killed by werewolves before your own first chance to act, and even more likely killed by weird and unjust group dynamics. Still, I've yet to see this game fail to entertain. Plus, it admits large groups and takes essentially no equipment. All good things.

Fun party game for larger groups.  Also, we have a friend for whom English is a second language and this game works well for her too.  I'm constantly surprised at how "non-word games" are much more language dependent than I had thought, but this one works!  Plus you just can't beat the price.  Gets old after a while or if you play too often.

The trick in this game is communication. If no one is willing to talk or try to negotiate why they are, or are not a Werewolf I find it fairly pointless and a random exercise but still get a little fun.  Since everyone else has fun though either way its played that means it has value.

Pros: classic social deduction party game with roleplaying mechanic, can be infused with fun storytelling, bluffing mechanic, very high player interaction, high player count

Werewolf is not a very good game. The player elimination is too fast so it excludes a lot of players for most of the game.

It's redeemable because all you need is scrap paper or a deck of cards, and it can include as many people as you can fit in a circle.

I have played this with really good (role)players and a great GM. I would really like to have those guys in my roleplaying group... But why restrict the roleplaying by not very fancy game mechanisms?

Who would have thought I liked this game? I did - and it's addictive. The main issue with this game is that the first 1-2 rounds of lynchings are almost entirely random. Otherwise - there is a lot to like. I would think the right group would be essential - RPGers could ruin the logical thinking in the game while strategy gamers and players who can read other people work best.

This is game that will teach you how to lie and detect lies under pressure.

Werewolf takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves.
\13\\13\
Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Villager, or Seer (a special Villager). There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game.
\13\\13\
The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. Also, the Seer (if still alive) asks whether another player is a Werewolf or not. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game.
\13\\13\
Werewolves win when there are an equal number of Villagers and Werewolves. Villagers win when they have killed all Werewolves. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.

RATING: 7

RATING: 8
I have literally lost sleep after playing this game - that's just how exciting it can be. The thrill of hiding in plain sight of a suspicious crowd and being FORCED to lie through your teeth is a huge rush, pure and simple. There are some problems that can be fixed with house rules. I hate letting the werewolves kill a villager off on first night before he or she can even do anything, for instance!

A possible major longterm weakness in the game is that the only way you can get out of having a seer accuse you is to pretend that you are a seer yourself. This limits the amount of actual lying a werewolf can do, and (perhaps?) gives the humans too big of an advantage if the humans are playing smart. Still, I have not played enough games to confirm this, so this will stay at a high rating for now.

We play this game as "Mafia" with a mafioso and guardian angel.  I'm amazed at how much kids love this game.  As a camp counselor, any time we have 10 minutes to kill, I can always get a group of 8 year old boys excited and playing.

So many people love this game that I'd be interested to see how it plays with a group of adults (I've only ever played it with kids...).

---

Update: Well, at Allison's Birthday Bash BBQ (or BBBBQ) we ended up playing Mafia and it's become something of a sensation amongst our friends, frequently breaking out at parties all over Corvallis!  

Bumping a point since it's such a big hit.

Update (8-11-08):

Two long sessions now with the "official" Werewolf cards + one expansion.  Lots of them are fun.  I especially like the little girl and cupid.  I still like some of our made-up roles a lot too though (detective, gumshoe).  Bumping another point as this is a game that doesn't seem to be getting old despite playing it every time we have a large group of people.

This is a very hit-or-miss game.

With a crowd of people you know really well it can be a lot of fun, and under those circumstances I'll usually be willing to play, but it loses a lot of the appeal with a bunch of other random strangers involved.

Either way, there's still a lot of random luck to it and arbitrary pile-ons seem to be the name of the game for the first "night" or two (unless someone on the evil side does something really boneheaded).  The bluffing, mistrust, and deduction stuff does come into play strongly later in the game, but by then half the players have already been eliminated so not everyone gets to take part in it every time.

If you've got a whole bunch of players (8+) and no one wants to split up into smaller groups you won't find many games that will accommodate them as well, but if you can split the group there are countless better games that become available, even within the same genre. Battlestar Galactica, for example, is vastly superior - the catch is that it works with only 6 or 7 players at most.


All of the extra roles can add a lot of spice to the game, but if there are too many or they get too complex it can bog the game down quite a bit.

Note that most of my plays [i](and all of the ones I have recorded on BGG)[/i] have been play-by-forum games, and were reasonably fun.  The handful of face-to-face games several years earlier didn't go so well and largely soured me on that version of the game - not enough to make me refuse future plays, but I'd try suggesting something else first.

[b]Raised my rating a full point because PBF games are pretty fun to moderate.[/b]

I've introduced this game to friends, relations, friends of friends, casual acquaintances etc.  A game that is good fun to play for 10  players is a rarity.  A little daunting to run initially if you've never played it before (one player needs to run the game), but lets face it, if my 7 year old can run a game with a dozen adults it cant be too hard!

I can definitely see the appeal of this social "experiment" er... game. Loads of fun with the right group, but I probably couldn't play this more than once or twice in a night. I was surprised how well it played with 16. [UPDATE] The honeymoon is over... Rating has dropped from 8 to 6.5 as the appeal is starting to wane. Can take too long, and if you're eliminated early, there is very little interest in watching everyone else argue for 20-30 minutes so you can findally do something again.

Are You a Werewolf? is a fantastic game. It was so much fun to act game moderator and tell just start playing without any lenghty rules explanations first. Basically, peek at your one card, remember if your a Villager or Werewolf and pay attention to what I say. I normally introduce the role of Sheriff during the 2nd day, allowing this person two votes when deciding who to lynch. Nominating yourself as Sheriff, is a good sign that you're the next to be lynched.  :D

I was introduced to this as Mafia during college.  Although I'm not a very social person by nature, I love the concept and the execution of this game.  My choice of role has got to be the moderator and I think I do a fairly good job at it.  I've done a couple of online Werewolf sessions via forums.  Not as good as the face-to-face version; it is also very time consuming (not to mention moves too slow) and for some reason exhausting.  Never grows old, although I no longer crave playing this at the wee hours in the morning (as much).

What better game can you play with 18 people?

RATING: 5.6
A game geared for at least eight people, which is actually somewhat engaging, and, most of all, quick!  Though there's not much to it, the suspense remains pretty high.

Tons of fun in large crowds.  If you want to make the game exponentially harder, play with the Tanner.

After 1 Play: I just don't get the appeal of this type of game.  I think a lot of people greatly overestimate their ability to see tells in other people's speech and demeanor.  In reality, I think most times the group is basically picking randomly and hoping for the best.

Having played some other hidden role games, and having enjoyed them much more, I think the problem is Werewolf is the lack of actual game actions.  In Bang or Shadow Hunters, for example, you can deduce people's roles not just by their pleadings, but by the things they do.

I'm not really a fan of F2F Werewolf. I was spoiled by the epic nature of online WW on BGG first, so the F2F games feel very plain and unengaging. It definitely depends on the group you play with, but I think if I have a group available to play WW I would rather play The Resistance or a couple different boardgames.

*the* Partygame for big grouds. You don't really need the game since normal cards would do the trick as well...
One of the most played games at gaming conventions/gatherings.

Over the many years of seeing this played in the hallways of GenCON, I did my best to avoid the game. Well today I played twice and was surprised. Maybe I have been missing a little fun... nice change of pace game from my usual preference.

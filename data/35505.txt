Such a great "take that" game, with some programming elements mixed in. The only downside is that it's a player elimination game, but games go so quickly that it's really not that big of a deal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The programming aspect and that it played quickly were the two best things about the game. There was a dash of trying to anticipate your opponents moves when doing the programming that we found a welcome addition. Decent bar/pub filler, but that's about it. Iconography could use some work.

RATING: 2
The game itself is ok.... As long as you don't mind using the included 'meeple.' These things are horrendous!! I would much rather have flat printed pieces as the other components were (plank, ship deck, etc.) It is borderline embarrassing to open the box and let people see those monstrosities! And now with their smugness.... ugh! "Mayday games is better than you! Deal with it!"

UPDATE - Since Mayday Games has been screwing up more Kickstarter projects lately (esp Card Quality), I decided to check the weight of the cards included in the game. Even giving them the benefit of the doubt, They weigh in at only 270 GSM as opposed to the 310 GSM promised during Kickstarter. This was also true about Dead Man's Draw (Carcass edition). And on their newest campaign, they only state that the cards are "Upgraded" with no reference to any weight or finish.

This game is pretty fun. Better than Get Bit! I think the fact that you can get several people falling in one round is fun. Also, retracting the plank on yourself is hilarious. Good filler game.

RATING: 5.5
Interesting idea, but I'm a little annoyed with the end game where two players win. It's a flaw in Get Bit too; the game design breaks down when you only have two players. Ultimately, I like this less than Get Bit as it's less about bluffing/outwitting and more about random chaos.

Quick game, easy to learn. I've lost to my friend's 4 year old son on more than one occassion and he was just picking random cards. I like the humorous card illustrations and naming. "Shove Left" means shoving the player on your left. Sometimes a friend's actions just beg for retaliation.  Fun game and small to carry around.

A fun filler game, but the base rules don't provide enough incentives to use the full range of cards. Most games digress into removing the planks and shoving.

That said, there's LOTS of opportunity to mod the game to fit your play style. Here are a couple of changes that we have made in our group:

Remove the Add a plank/Remove a plank cards.
After every round (each player reveals a card), the Kraken gets a turn and someone rolls the die for the Kraken. On 5-6, the kraken eats a plank. On a 1 a plank is restored. This allows the players to focus on playing the other cards while ensuring that the plank dwindles down over time.

For increase risk/reward use the Clothesline card:
If you have two pirates on the same tile, they both must move forward. They then shove ALL pirates on the tile they arrive at forward one tile (including their own teammates if they're there).
If you don't have two pirates on the same tile, one of your pirates must move forward one tile.

UPDATE: My youngest daughter and I figured out a co-op vs AI variant for this game and we both loved it. She isn't very competitive. She likes playing games for the social aspect. So playing this one as a team against a moderately easy AI was a very relaxing and fun experience to have with her.

Got a chance to play this with three of my kids (6,7 and 13) and then with two other adults.  The gameplay is very simple to explain even to small children.  My youngest took a while to catch on how the programming works, but in the end, I did not win, and I sure tried.  That means two things.  One, there is enough chance to the game that I don't need to go easy on my kids so they can win once in a while.  And two, they were able to grasp the concept very quickly and pull of good moves with good planning.  This, to me, makes for a VERY solid game to play with kids.  Then there is the game I played with my adult gamer friends.  That one was a little more intense.  The winner, although plenty of luck is involved, clearly deserved the victory.  Which also makes this game a solid entry or starter to a night of gaming with advanced players.  The art design of the box and the characters is superb.  The color palette is just dark enough to make is not seem like a little kids game at first glance, yet it is cute enough for my kids to giggle about the pictures as they are picking their cards.  It also looks excellent on my shelf.  The meeple stickers are a "must have" item, in my opinion.  They do not perfectly match the size of the meeples, but it's close enough that they look excellent while playing the game.  I have mostly girls, so the inclusion of the girl pirate stickers was a stroke of genius.  I love this game.  I expect it to be played in my house frequently and I plan to always take it with me for a great starter or palate cleanser while playing games with my advanced group.

Shout out to Mayday for a very high quality game.  From the box, to the manual, to the meeples, to the cards, it is all very well made and an excellent addition to my collection.

You are a band of incompetent pirates, who have been ordered to walk the plank - but so are your competitors.  But not everyone is going into the drink.  You'll want to push and shove others into the Kraken's maw, and somehow escape that fate yourself.

Interesting Mechanic: Walk the Plank is kind of like a mix of Robo Rally and Guillotine.  You'll pick three actions per turn, but those actions will then be done one at a time in rotating order.  For example, you might declare that one of your pirates is going to charge an opponent's meeple, driving him into the sea, but before that happens, other players may have pushed you out of position and shortened the length of the plank, meaning that your pirate dives helplessly into the sea.

This is a quick, easy game to teach.  It isn't going to win any strategy awards, but it will provide plenty of laugh out loud moments.

Poor component quality of wooden components is no surprise for a Mayfair product. The meeples are shamefully asymmetrical and poorly painted. I wouldn't lick your hands after handling them or you'll likely end up losing I.Q. points. Thank god for the stickers, even with them not fitting properly.

I do like the art, and the cards and box are nice. The deck and plank pieces are oddly different in quality from the art on the others. They ought to have done more to build in some more art into those by adding more texture and little details.

I am one who will not table a game if it doesn't look great, and this one is borderline. I think I will have to get some new meeples from another source.

Essentially, Walk the Plank is a slightly more tactical (as opposed to totally random) and less overproduced version of Gezanke auf der Planke. Or, in other words, a chaotic mess.

Arrr.

Silly, stupid little game which is nonetheless one of the funniest I've played.

Everyone starts with three pirates and the idea is to ensure that your rivals get booted off the pirate ship and into Davy Jones' locker.  Draw cards from your deck in to a hand at the start of the turn but be warned that the cards and ordering are locked so if you make your pirate charge and there's nothing between you and a watery grave...oh dear.

Play with a couple of drinks inside you, a fantastic and quirky little game that can be played.

Quick game in which you choose the moves you want to make in order to push the opponents off the plank, hoping you don't get pushed in first. Moves become fairly repetitive, but for kids it's entertaining and it makes a decent starter game.

RATING: 6
A programmed action game about pushing and shoving each other off the plank of a pirate ship. Silly fun with the kids!

There really isn't a lot more to say. Each turn, players play three face-down cards from a hand of about eight, which includes actions such as pushing the player on your left or right, charging out and shoving, running back towards the ship and extending or retracting the plank. The plank is three tiles long and tiles can be pulled right from under players. The game ends at the conclusion of the round when one player loses all three of their pawns to the drink. There is usually more than one winner. There is lots of laughing and ribbing when we play this. We are fans of programmed action games and this one is now our "quick fix" in the genre.

UPDATE: Lowered rating from a 7 to a 6.. Not sure who lasting the appeal is on this one.

Described as the prequel to Get Bit, this is light programmed movement game that is easy to teach, quick to play, and will generate lots of laughter with the right group. I keep it for playing with friends and family who are not gamers. I like it and always enjoy it, but for me, I can't rate it any higher than this. 

The programmed movement game I would rather play is volt. This is better for non-gamers, but not by much, and Volt is a much better game. I don't dislike Walk the Plank, but I don't like it enough to rate it more highly. That's not entirely fair since, for what it aims to be, this is a solid design.

RATING: 6.5
In game terms, each round players secretly stack three of their ten action cards, then they take turns revealing and playing those actions one by one no matter what's gone wrong between the planning and the doing. If you plan to have a pirate shove someone off the plank on your third move and all he sees are his own best mates, he will still shove away! Some cards bear a skull on them, and these powerful cards must remain on the table the round after they're played, but otherwise players then pick up their action cards and start a new round. As soon as two or fewer pirates remain on board, the game ends and the owner (or owners) of these pirates win! Watch out, though, as sometimes every pirate will end up in the drink, which means that no one wins other than the sharks circling in the water below...

I received my prototype copy as a Christmas present directly from Shane Steely - one of the game's designers.

This is a fast, fun, filler game that reminds me of a more confrontational Cartagena or Knizia's Formula Motor Racing game. It's a game of survival and you need to best utilize your 3 actions per turn to try and keep at least one of your pirates alive through the end of the game.

The game has aspects of Roborally as you need to "program" your next 3 moves in advance - making it difficult to know exactly what is going to happen, but that kind of "controlled chaos" is right up my alley and I enjoyed the game quite a bit. Certain card combo's can work to your advantage and anticpating when the right time to get rid of a section of the plank is essential to putting yourself in a position to win.

I want to play again with the full compliment of 5 players as I think there might be a bit more "bashing the leader" to the game with more players.

I'll post some pics of my prototype soon!

The first time I played this game was at GenCon 2012. It was at the end of a very long day of talking to people at the booth and I was tired and really more in the mood for a burger than a game.  I sat down and played it with my 3 kids and had an absolute blast.  My kids loved it and my then 11-year old son liked it so much he kept asking for weeks afterwards: "Dad, don't forget about that pirate game, we need to get the license for it!"

He was right, and we did.  Yes Mayday Games is producing this game, but that is BECAUSE I rate it so highly and we still play it regularly as a family.  I rate this game a 9 because it is so great not because we are manufacturing it.  In fact, we are manufacturing it BECAUSE we love it so much!  

But of course we are quite biased as the manufacturer too!

I really expected more from this one. I love these programming games where you can mess up someone's plans and laugh about it. The problem is, Walk the Plank has almost no purpose to it. I get that you want to be the last person with pirates left alive, but the game just feels completely spiteful. When you shove someone, you usually have a choice, and that choice usually has no strategic bearing unless you want someone to have less pirates than other people. I was really hoping this would be another game in the same vein as Robo Rally and Colt Express, but it's nowhere near as good.

---Preliminary thoughts---

You place a good looking Roborally in a shelf next to a tin deluxe version of Get bit!, you wait nine months, and that's what you get! :D

It's a fine filler, more similar to Get Bit!, but there are more decisions/options and more elements to base the decisions on. So, it's an improvement over it. 

I think it can assume the role of Get bit! for players that find it too simple.

We played it with 3 people and it was over in a flash. I dare say it was over way to quickly. Maybe if we play with the maximum number of 5 players then it will go better.

[i]- Fast, fun filler game that you can teach anyone in 60 seconds (And most of our games lasted 10 minutes or less).
- Pre-programmed movement, but you are setting up 3 moves at a time. By the time you get to your third move you may end up running right of the plank and meet your untimely demise.
- The artwork is really good with nice components and pirate meeples.
- This game is funny; it is hard not to laugh at the chaos that unfolds as the game progresses.[/i]

You know the game's in a bit of trouble when you accept that there's so much randomness and king-making that when you decide to program your action cards randomly, you start doing better than everyone else. As was the case in our game. It's a pushyou-pullme game. Plan out 3 cards to shove other people towards the end of the plank or move yourself back, reveal them one by one in turn order and hope people decide to shove other people instead of you. And that each card you flip can resolve successfully after everyone else has moved stuff around that you obviously can't plan for. Some light fun for 20 mins, but so frothy and meaningless that it doesn't beckon another play.

I thought this game was fun UNTIL I realised what was happening.

Players keep ganging up on other players and rapidly eliminating them from the game. There's no defence against it. You can be out of the game 3 minutes into a 20+ minute play.

It strongly incentivises you to play like that. There's no point nudging players up and down the plank when, instead, you can easily join forces and rapidly accelerate one player off the end of the plank on most of the turns.

It's a simple game, so it's not even fun and strategic to make it happen. It's simply like "ooh, you've nudged Mike closer to the end of the plank. And I'm standing there so will nudge him further forward - over to you, Claire, so you can give him the final push off the end of the plank yeah?" Claire will likely say "Will do - sorry Mike!"

I'm not saying it promotes victimisation of particular players. That's certainly possible, but it would be hard to fully coordinate because players have secretly plan their moves on their own. But once their action choices are being revealed, one player is likely to be unavoidably sent out of the game.

Maybe less devious players wouldn't play it like above. But then it just becomes random chaos.

I give it a 3 just because it feels thematic and cheeky enough to earn that.

Sigh.

Its a light and fun game of programmable movements. You choose your movements ahead and then everybody reveals in order.

Update now that it's a Kickstarter project: I've played this game many, many times, and it's always been lots of fun. Trying to out-think your opponents is an interesting challenge, and it's frustratingly fun when unexpected things happen to mess with your carefully laid plans...

1 play, 3er

A quick little filler along the lines of Guillotine, except that you're trying to move each other's pawns to the front of the line. There's also the added element of programmed card play so you get the fun of some semi-random, chaotic interactions (similar to RoboRally). This is a light and fun game -- great if you're looking for that kind of thing!

[b]--- Game Summary ---[/b]
Place the boat, with 3 plank pieces extended out towards Davy Jones' Locker, on the table. All players' pawns (3 each) go on the boat. Players each have an identical deck of cards, each showing some kind of action. Actions include things like: shove another pirate at the same location as one of yours one space forward, withdraw the plank (make it shorter), move 1 space, etc. 

Each round, players select 3 cards to play in order. Starting with the Start Player, reveal and resolve the first card; then the second; then the third. Any pirates shoved off the end of the plank are out of the game. Then, players retrieve any cards from this turn without a "skully" icon on them, and any skully cards from the previous turn. Start Player passes to the RIGHT (previous last player). Continue playing until only one player's pawns, or any 2 pawns, remain in play = winner(s)!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is a hidden programmed movement game where players are each trying to force all of another player's pawns off a plank into Davy Jones' Locker.

On a player's turn they program 3 actions which include things like shoving other pawns, dragging other pawns, and extending and retracting the plank.  These actions are then revealed in turn order and any pawns pushed off the end of the plank are lost.  Last player standing wins.

The hidden programmed movement is actually something I kind of like in RoboRally but I dislike this game quite a bit.  There is no real strategy to speak of, it is utter chaos.  I think the biggest differences between this and RoboRally are 1. this game's "map" consists of only the ship space and 1-3 plank spaces instead of a large map with many of its own obstacles and features.  2.  RoboRally action resolution is based on a speed value on the programmed action.  In this game turn order is way too important.  There are several situations where you can guarantee an elimination based solely on the virtue of getting to act before another player.

In the end what you have here is just luck-dependent chaos.

Surprisingly well received by friends, because it is such a funny notion to push your friends over. Eventually, the game became too random with more than 3 players, so we just flipped our top cards without rearranging and played to see the effects. Had a great laugh over the charging suicides. It's indeed an experience more than a game. Winning is not the objective. The objective is to do your opponents (your friends) in, form and break allies.

RATING: 7
Really fun. You program your next three moves by laying down three face-down cards, and then you each play your cards one at a time. This makes for some fun surprise moments like when your charge forward with one of your pirates then knock one of your other pirates to his death because your opponent moved out of the way unexpectedly.

You're the stupidest of the stupid pirates, each round you will place three actions face down, and then reveal them one at a time around  the circle. Your goal is to push the other pirates off the ship while keeping yours home safe.

light little programming filler about pushing other pirates off the boat and saving yourself. Great as an entree for a sweet night of gaming.

Excellent light programming game with lots of silly laughs and a dusting of strategy as you plan out your turn. Superb fun.

A nice effort which seems to advance the ball on what a filler is - accessible with some strategic elements brought together and refined from other games.  As one who was eliminated after one turn more than once, the post-elimination time can drag on, and it is random and hectic, but it’s a result of decisions  made with non-perfect information , thus making it more fun than "random and hectic" due to things like bad dice rolls or bad  card luck.

It's not a bad middle of a game - not really my type of game, but not at all bad for its type - but it doesn't have a real beginning or end. The start of the game is very dull, and would benefit from a setup where the pirates weren't all on the ship. The end of the game is just awful, as it has the potential to drag on forever, especially if the remaining players have used their plank-removal cards already. The game would benefit enormously from some sort of timing mechanism where planks were automatically removed (or something similar).

Bottom line: this isn't ready for publication. It's what I'd expect to see from a fairly early prototype.

This game is all about fun.  My young boys love playing it.  Similar to RoboRally in that you plot out your future turns by laying out cards, however there are some nice differences.  WTP it sets up in 30 seconds, has direct player interaction with just about every turn, there aren't any random card draws, and it finishes in less than 10 minutes-- all perfect attributes for playing with three boy less than 10 years old.  The ghost meeple "expansion" allows the first person eliminated to continue to play the game as a spoiler.  A great game just before bedtime.  Highly recommended!

Everyone plays a mischievous band of pirates who are jostling for position on a plank.  Try not to get pushed into the big sea beast.  Great for kids.

(Note: I'm one of the designers.)

I've played this many times and it continues to be fun every time I play.  Has a good amount of double-think trying to out-guess what the opponent is going to play and a high fun factor because of the possible (often unexpected) outcomes.

Some of my favorite art in a game, great production over all for such a small product.

I think it's a clever game for streamlining the programming mechanism into a small package.  Can make for a fun Beer and Pretzels filler.  Definitely need more players for more chaos.  3 players is pretty dull as the game lasts longer than it should since not enough people are getting shoved around.

Pretty light-fare, little thinking required, the only time you can really strategize is when it comes around and you get two turns in a row.

Pretty fun game though.

At first I was thrilled with the prospect of pushing my friends into a waiting kraken's mouth. And the mind games of who is going to do what and when provided an interesting challenge. Over time though the programming nature of the game became... exhausting. Was fun for a few months, but no urge to bring it out anymore.

I love this game because it's easy to teach others how to play, and you can whip through a round in 15 minutes no problem. We usually play after we've completed a longer board game and aren't quite ready to put the games away yet!

A good game after the Kraken has been released (from Cyclades) to check which of your fellows should feed it.

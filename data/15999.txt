I admit to being a bit disappointed with this.  Overall it took us 4.5 hours,  albeit with a lot of wading through rules.  We'd probably make it through a lot quicker next time,  but I think I would still struggle to finish in under 2 hours.  But it wasn't that so much,  as ending up with a very split board - I only had access to one tile south of the line east of Glasgow,  whereas my opponent only started using track in "my half" quite late in the game.  So other than my opponent (successfully) blocking my attempts to go South,  there was very little interaction.  I'd rate this lower than 18AL of 18SCAN (my only other 18xx games).  Apparently some folk recommend Unit 2 over this one,  even for a 2-player.  I may give it a try.  Happy to play again (provided the playing time comes down - a lot!)  Edit: down to about 3 hours on next playing.  Much better!

11-July Played my first game last night with Charlie.  Trying to decide whether or not to drop $300 for Units 1,2, and 3.  It is definitely more of a route/portfolio optimization game without much of the stock dumping of 1830 (as far as I can tell, selling stocks does not drop the share price).  The 2-player game took us a little over 4 hours but Charlie thinks he may have put in $5K or $6K instead of the $4K he was supposed to.  Can't decide if there is enough here to warrant getting it. I have Steam Over Holland and 1860 and am getting 1830.

After having played a few more 18XXs, I'm glad I picked this up.  It's a kinder, gentler 18xx without all of the stock manipulation where whoever can manage their companies best will win.

Update: Currently I'm leaning more towards the 1830 branch and so my ratings reflect that.  That said, I think it's an excellent example of the 1829 line and one I wouldn't hesitate to play.

Lots of classic 18xx stuff going on here with some nice ideas - particularly share movement being influenced by dividend/price and the ability to upgrade towns to cities, which makes a real difference. Despite 1825' reputation as a beginners' game I'm not convinced that this will play that much quicker than 1830. Docked half a point because I miss 1830's more volatile 2D stockmarket.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly subtle perfect information game.  Very obviously not a German game or a game in pursuit of the German design genre.  The game mostly exists in your head in the number space that represents the various companies and their potential futures.  The economic system has strong "waterbed" qualities (push down here, pops up somewhere else) which would seem to make run-away leaders difficult, but in fact almost masks them from view.  Very interactive in this regard.  

This is a timing game: it is all about owning the right shares at the right times.

Appears very replayable, and again in a rather un-German way due to the subtlety of the waterbed qualities rather than the emergent depth of the rules.  

Beware: Tile choice for the track tiles is astoundingly short/tight for yellow, green and russet

The regionals and their minor companies do a lot to balance and extend the base game in interesting and useful fashions.

The weakest of the 1825 units.  Unit 3 makes a far better and more interesting 2 and 3 player game.

RATING: 8.5
At first I dismissed the 1825 branch out of hand.  The best parts of 18xx were to be found in the stock market but I'm revising that opinion.  It's remarkable how much devilish subtly can be packed into one of these games, and, even without the threat of a train rush/rust, how difficult it is to run companies really well.  There are still plenty of time for juggling company fortunates and syphoning money from Privates back into your big companies.  

My one concern is with the minor companies.  It seems like you want to set their par values quite high and, even with modest profits, they can eclipse the larger railways.  That doesn't seem very reasonable, but I also might be misunderstanding some of the rules.

Players invest in railway companies, with majority shareholders becoming company directors.  Players alternate with share dealing rounds (buy/sell shares in companies) and operating rounds (running the companies).  Companies develop railway networks on the map of northern England and Scotland, purchase trains, and run those trains over their routes.  Running a train generates income which can be paid out to shareholders (increasing share price) or held by the company for future expansion (decreasing the share price).  Quite a simple rulebook disguises a rather deep and cerebral game.... and 1825 is considered one of the lighter 18xx games.  If you want to dip a toe in the 18xx waters, this is probably a good place to begin.  Can be bolted to 1825 Unit 2 for a larger game.

18xx certainly isn't at its best with just two players. That said, 1825 U3 works better than I would have expected, in a large part because it is much more of a track building game than it is a stock manipulation game.

The confined space, the very limited tile set, and the fairly tame train rush (only the 2s ever rust) still make for an interesting game. I'd probably pick some other game over 2 player 18xx most of the time, but if you are looking for the train experience with two U3 qualifies easily.

As an expansion to U2 this didn't work that great. Only the 3 majors saw play, and they became their own little enclave up north as it was too expensive to build south.

A solid 18XX game with heavy emphasis on running trains over stock shenanigans. The fact that it plays 2 (only!) is noteworthy. There's a lot of differences between this and other 18XXes and it adds up to a different sort of game.

RATING: 6
Given the scarcity of 18xx players it's perhaps surprising that more 2 player games haven't been made available. However taken in isolation, this is the weakest of the 1825 units. Without randomness, the only variation in a game is the decisions made by players, so with the 2 player limit this is rather like constantly playing chess with the same opening and the same defence. The game is also unfair (possibly by design), even new players need to be made aware that the NBR is significantly weaker than the Caledonian. If you really want to play 18xx with 2, Railroad Barons is a much better bet.
All of the above said, Units 2 & 3 combine to make a fine game for 5. The main cities are widely separated and the terrain is tough. Recommended.
My rating: This Unit:6, Combined Units:10.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

Initial impression. Unit 3 seems just a tad too small and restricted to really stand up on its own. Surprisingly, the game took longer to play than a two-player game of Unit 1, despite the latter being the larger of the two. In the future I think I will prefer playing Unit 1 or 2, or perhaps Unit 3 in conjunction with Unit 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unit 3 is the North of England and Scotland. This unit is recommended for 2 players, and is a lot cheaper than 1860 for a two player version. 

Can be combined with Unit 1 and 2, though for obvious reasons not with Unit 1 on it's own.

RATING: 7
Tresham managed to design a functioning 2-player 18xx version. While I could see this getting scripted as other games from the 1829 family have become in my 18xx group (1835 namely), it's not likely to see such frequent play that it could get a problem. The occasions to break out a two-player four hour 18xx are too few. On these rare occasions, 1825 U3 manages to pack quite a punch of track-laying-, train rush- and company cycling challenges into one package.

Rules ambiguities:
- Minor companies only lay track after they've purchased their permanent train
- 7 trains are available once the last 5 has been bought even when where are still 3T's or 3U's available
- Halts: can be used to upgrade tile 8 and used by 3T's for free while other trains ignore the halt

Can't imagine giving this a 4th play. Seems like there are massive balance issues with one player being able to force ownership of both majors, which gives him control over pretty much everything in the game.

RATING: 8
A pleasant gaming experience, even though I suppose it could be a little bit better componentwise. It's not as nasty as games from the 1830 line because the stock market ist absolutely tame, so the focus is investing in lucrative lines at the right time respectively actually managing your lines to your best abilities thus making it quite different from other 18xx games in which it is often a good strategy to plunder and destroy companies. Also, it is an okay two-player experience (still takes a lot of time - first game with a non-experienced gamer took us around 5 hrs which is probably ok, because teaching and looking up oddities in the rules took a considerable amount of time because it was my first game of 1825 as well).

Wow, this one is good. I really like the 1825 series (and having played a bunch more 18xx games I appreciate it that much more), but until now hadn't gotten a chance to break this one out. The asymmetry is interesting and the game plays very quickly. As with the other 1825 games, much of the game is questioning your commitment to holding a stock vs starting a new company. The minors are also very clever.

The tile selection, in classic Tresham fashion, is punishing, and players may appreciate playing with K1 , K6, or D1.

See my review in Counter. I would not have believed this was possible. This is tough to beat as a 2-player game, let alone an 18xx. There's so many little nuances which you just don't get with the other two units. It also makes a good expansion to unit 2 for 4-5 players. Waiting impatiently for the North of Scotland regional kit to "finish off" the series...

Very good game for two players. Takes about three hours and seems fairly balanced, all games have been close even though they've seemed runaway victories early on. I've been fortunate enough to play four games with the same opponent and the game just keeps on getting better.

Things learnt: minority shareholder should have at least 40% of CR in the beginning. M&C is a good minor, because you can pump over 1000 pounds in it and buy two good trains to some other company.

Dave Berry has a nice kit for this unit, some of the changes on the board are quite good (adding Berwick-upon-Tweed, for example, is a must, and I like downgrading Dumfries).

Suggest.

First impression: There is plenty of action for two players. I liked how you have control over many corporations at the same time and can more easily use them in synergy. Stock market is a quite simplified, only 2-trains will rust during the game and you're never forced to buy a train for company from your purse. This is quite nice and relaxed game on the 18xx-scale and a good starting point. But you can make moves that are nastier than those in your average euro game. At least I liked the game a lot as it offers a lot of things from 18xx world in a very approachable package.

1825 Unit 3 is the 4th 18xx I've played, and I enjoyed it enough to order the other units as well. Some points I liked:
- the length of a single unit is not excessive (~3.5 hours in our first play, with paper money)
- no dumping of companies (which is especially important in 2-player games because noone would invest in the other player's companies)
- share price does not fall when selling shares, and can rise very fast, so the emphasis in the game is more on running the trains well than on the stock market
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
On first reading of the rules they seemed straightforward. Once play began it was clear that we had a lot of questions. Hoping that re-reading and BGG will resolve most of the issues. Rating will go up if once we can be sure we are playing correctly.

Played second game correctly, NBR got killed. Rating is a strong 7 but not quite an 8. I think a third player in 18XX really adds to this game system. Will play again and try to time the endgame a bit better. 6133/4980

Third & fourth games were much closer but I think NBR has a hard time winning. 5516/5411 & 5764/5739

Next play will be an attempt at a 3-player variant; previously 2 of the Minors never even got into play. I think the bank will go up to 5000 (like in Unit 2).

Three-player game worked BETTER than as a 2-player (5881/5655/5503). 5000 bank, 500 cash, & 12 certificate limit. Private companys were dealt out to establish player order; the 160 private holding the Priority deal. No Minors until the one of the 3 Majors was sold out. All but 2 trains and 4 Minor certificates sold. NBR is at a disadvantage such that making the small towns not count against a trains range (ala 18GA) may be necessary (the same as making all the trains 'U' trains).

Update: NBR early is broken. A stratgegy of CAL (60:40) and then GSWR (30:50) early, followed by building in the South is just too one-dimensional.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An amazingly intense and excellent 2-player game for experienced 18xx players.

Difficult multiple choices in most SDR player turns.  The decisions needed during the ORs are also difficult.  Both the geography constraints and the limited tile availability make it too easy to find a required tile upgrade is no longer available.  Station garrisons can make a big impact.  It is not easy deciding when to hold back dividends and when to pay them out.  Decisions on train purchase from other companies and at what price add to the fun.  And the NBR is not easy to run.

Amazing, brilliant, intense and worth every minute of game play.

For newcomers to 18xx, 1825 Unit 2 is highly recommended and Unit 1 is also very good.  Unit 3 on its own should be avoided until you have built up some experience in the other 1825 units.  See 1825 Unit 2 and 1825 Unit 1 for further comments.

However, when 1825 Units 2 and 3 are combined into one game, this works out very well, particularly when also using kits D1, K2 and K5.  Most 18xx players would enjoy this combination.  (See 1825 kit D1 for further comments.)

I started my investigation of the 18xx games as something of a skeptic.  While I don't think they are the greatest train games ever, I do think they are darn good.  I will note that these really feel more like economic games and not so much like train games -- to me.  However, I certainly agree with the draw these games have.  Since my preference is more toward the route building / planning aspect of the games and not stock manipulation, I sought out the 1825 series.  Despite the high prices I am happy with my purchase.  I do find that I want to play any chance I get, which really is not all that often.  Of particular note, this was the first of the 18xx games I ever tried, and I really enjoyed it.  I understand that 2-players games in the genre are something of an anomaly, but I still found this to be really pleasant.  Unfortunately, my wife is really not into the stock aspects of this game.  She would much rather play one of the Empire Builder games for three hours than this.  Maybe I'll be able to convince her to play again.[02/08/2007]

Alright!  I didn't think it was going to work as well as it does.  Tresham really pulled of a 2 player version well.  This will more than likely go up to a 10 with more plays.  As usual, with this system, the track laying is tight.  Getting the tiles you need while you can is much more important in this series than in others, and in many respects the because rusting can be looked at as a good thing, the system has a tile rush more than a train rush.  Engaging right to the end.

RATING: 7
As a rare two player 18XX, it's difficult to compare this game directly to others from the series. Like other entries from the 1825/1829 "branch" the stock market may feel too tame for those accustomed to 1830 - picking stocks is simply a question of assessing which stocks will give you back the most for their value, with no worries of being saddled with a failing company. However, due to the way the board develops and the way minor companies work, that assessment is a lot less simple than you might think. Indeed, even the opening moves on the first turn, which initially seem very scripted, turn out to pose some interesting questions. After my first few plays, I really started to appreciate how tightly tuned this game is and after about a dozen plays, I'm still nowhere close to a "standard" strategy.

This game will certainly continue to come out when I'm in the mood for 18XX but only have a single opponent. But even stacked against the many other fine 2p games out there, this is worth playing.

Fun to play 18xx in Britain. Actually, the last time I played this was with a Scottish friend of mine, even more appropriate!

1825 definitely feels like a game focused on running a good company and managing your routes rather than worrying too much about the stock market and burning you opponent. However, there is plenty of room for screwage on the board with your routs and with the companies you choose.

Unit 3 is specifically a 2 player, the only specifically 2 player 18xx that I know about.

6/18/07 - I played this twice a few months back and it seemed really promising.  I haven't found the chance to bring it back out again, but I'm looking forward getting one.  The games I played were very relaxed and intimate (since there were just 2 of us) compared to 1830 and I really enjoyed myself.

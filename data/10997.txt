Much more fun than a filler game should be allowed to be. A challenge of prioritizing, recalibrating and taking calculated risks. Risk-taking pays off, but not reliably, making all strategies more dynamic.

I normally find Faidutti's games a little too chaotic but this has got a bit more depth to it and is a very good little auction / set collecting game. The production die rolls will often decide the winner however

Ehhh.  Not overly interactive, a lot of luck between the cards coming out, and the dicerolls that dictate whether you get income from the mines.  Not bad, but I'd never request it.

Very fun and exciting game.  Good amount of luck, sure, but a TON of fun.  That's the key element, FUN!  I like some randomness in games, prevents them from becoming boring and stale.  A very interactive game where people can get pretty cutthroat.  Excellent addition to any collection.

I'm finally getting into this game... it has to be played with 4 or 5 to shine. The combination of auctions, settler's resource rolls and screwing with your neighbors work together well. I'm hoping to play a lot more of this with my friends who are used to card games like Munchkin or Che Geek. UPDATE: traded for Heroscape stuff.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed this game a lot. We had a discussion whether it had more theme than T&E or less so. But one way or another, this was a fun and tense game. The mechanics of bidding are pretty much unique, and the randomness of the resource generation and the card draw will probably keep it fresh for a while. 
It's light, and mostly a filler, but it's a fun one whice I'd love to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun filler that lasts about 40 mins.  Thematically, it's very well done - tossing sticks of dynamite, becoming a governor if your rich enough in mines, saloons, dangerous mines etc.  There's a great deal of luck in it - but I don't object to that as with gold prospecting, it seems pretty apt.  The bidding mechanism is somewhat unusual in that you pass the money bid to the right (and then the receiving player passes half of that right again).  Sometimes you're bidding to get to receive money not spend it, sometimes you're bidding to stop someone else gain a card.

Wild West Fun all the way...but certainly not as good as Bang! for that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun little card game.  Does have some of the same problem as Settlers with mines producing on a certain number, but you have more control over which numbers you have, and you get more of them.  So the problem is much less pronounced here.

RATING: 7
A rather fun auction game.  There are a few interesting mechanics that make this one pretty interesting: the mayors and saloons, money spent is passed to the right with each person keeping half, and two dice are rolled after each turn for production.  These additional mechanics make the auctions much more interesting and important, also providing a small element of randomness to the game.  I also like the theme and art - very well done.  Game duration is just right.

All in all, a fun game!  I like this one.  It fills that "longer filler" category quite well.

It's an interesting game, with a good bid mechanic that makes the money always turn between players, it's very difficult to evaluate the right amount of money to spend on a bid. I felt that the duration of this game was a little bit too long for this kind of game. Anyway, Cathala and Faidutti made a different and inovative game.

An enjoyable game with an interesting auction mechanic. The auction element isn't just about  who wins the auction all the time which makes it neat. Often you'll be factoring in things like who will get money and in what order will people choose cards. So you don't always have to win the auction to get what you want and frequently you will not want to win the auction and you'll still get what you want.

A great combination of Bidding and Luck.  You bid on the cards, hoping to get a card with the best probability of gold production, which is fun on its own, but with the inclusion of Dynamite, Saloons, Mayors, etc, it makes the game a blast to play.

RATING: 5
A light filler bidding game. The bidding mechanism is actually quite interesting. There is some luck because mines produce gold each turn depending an a dice roll like in Settlers of Catan. There is also a bit of chaos because you can easily screw your opponents. The western theme didnt really grab me. Artwork could be better.

A "filler" which uses dice rolling and auctioning in an interesting manner but overall a bit too lucky and too long.  It's hard to determine which cards are actually worth it to bid high on when production rolls are as random as they are.  The card play and take that elements are always pretty fun, but given the plethora of many other card fillers out there, I can't see myself ever playing this again.  Citadels for instance is just as easy to teach, plays within the same time frame ~45 minutes and is just a whole lot more portable and interesting overall.

RATING: 6.5
{1 play • 4 players} Really taken with this simple yet elegant game.  My rating may drop a bit after more plays, but for right now, I'm really looking forward to those plays.  However, after the novelty wears off, it wouldn't surprise me if this only hit the table once or twice a year, as there's there's kind of not enough there to stick to your ribs, yet there's just enough "stuff" going on to prevent it from being a frothy, fluffy filler.  Still, a really cool little game, and it didn't hurt that we played it using real poker chips rather than the little plastic ones provided.

*** UPDATE October 2009 [inital rating: 8, new rating: 6.5] ***

Wow, I couldn't have been more on the money predicting how I'd feel about this game down the line.  Interestingly enough, it wasn't so much that the novelty wore off as it was the slightly bitter taste those Dynamite cards left in your mouth.  And the steal card, too.  Once I got over the "fun" of discovery here, I didn't much care for the "distruction," especially since there's also kind of a perceived leader thing that can happen.

Still some cool ideas here, though.  And I really love how the bidding payouts work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
fun twist away from settlers.  turn order and payouts can be a pain sometimes, but it's a very fun game.  approach it understanding there's luck involved and you can have a good time.  remember that the high payout, low frequency mines are worth more toward the end because everything pays out once when the game is over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun little bidding game with more to it than it originally seems... just how much cash do I want to give to the player on my right? Do I want to strengthen my hold on this mayorship so I don't have to pay anyone else when these mines pay out, or do I want to force someone else to have a concession in my town? Can get kind of cutthroat, which is always interesting.

I really like the length and interaction in boomtown.  I've had fun every time it has hit the table.  It is a good gateway game and ussually has pretty tense finishes.  There is a fair sized luck component that I'm sure will turn off the die-hard luckless proponents.

A very quirky game that could simply be described as "For Sale with Area Control." This serves, like For Sale, as an excellent filler, but gives you a lot more to think about. Where will you pursue being mayor? Which card is best? Do you want a mine that's likely to produce, or a mine from a certain town where a opponent might steal mayorship from you? Thinky, but no more than it needs to be. Be warned though, the game is SUPER swingy.

You'd think I'd learn by now.  Whenever a game claims to "improve" on settlers, I invariably just end up thinking "Man, I wish I was playing settlers right now."

We got some fun out of this game but we felt like it needed a good deal of tweaking in order to get there. We roll twice for mine production and we alternated the number of cards up for choosing (equal to players, 1 less than players, 1 more than players). With those changes it is pretty fun.

The whole town laughed at my great-grandfather, just because he worked hard and saved his money. True, working at the hardware store didn't pay much, but he felt it was better than what everybody else did, which was go up to the volcano and collect the gold nuggets it shot out every day. It turned out he was right. After forty years, the volcano petered out. Everybody left town, and the hardware store went broke. Finally he decided to collect gold nuggets too, but there weren't many left by then. Plus, he broke his leg and the doctor's bills were real high.

What a vicious little game.  All of us were newbies in our first play and wasn't sure how good/bad cards were.  Some of the rules seemed ambigious to us, as well.  It was a runaway with the person who had the Governer.  I'd like to give it another spin, as beside the above notes, I found it fun (being vicious is fun, too).

Update:  Bumped to a 7.  I find it to be an excellent filler, end of the evening card game.

RATING: N/A
The trade condition is: fair.  The wood pieces in the game show hardly any signs of usage at all.  Although the cards have some minor wear on the edges they have stood the test of time because they are so thick.  Since I was playing this game with kids I have used a black marker to cover the boobs that were hanging out on three cards with girls!  LOL The red white and blue chips used in the game show very minor signs of usage.  The things that's are in the worst shape is the rule book and the box.  Although is quite wrinkled, the rule book it is totally readable.  The box has tattered and a few corners have ripped but I have repaired them with tape.  The game has no odor and has always in a smoke free environment.

I've enjoyed playing this game so often that some of the game components are well worn.  But ALL of the parts and pieces are there and it's a great play!

Okay game.  Novel auction payment mechanism that re-distributes the cash paid by the winning bidder among his opponents.

Yuck!

Really simple screw your neighbour type game with an old west gold prospecting theme. The auction mechanic sees you passing your winning bid to your right and each player then takes half and passes the rest on, so money is constantly being redistributed. Get cards to represent mines and get the displayed income each turn on a dice roll (quite like Settlers there) but there's also dynamite, mayors, saloons, stick ups and other cards to play to benefit yourself and take other players down. Definitely an entertaining game and quite quick too.

Suffers from the same issue that irks me in Settlers - production rolls can be incredibly frustrating and there simply aren't enough of them during a game to even out. That said, the bidding aspect and turn order/payout mechanic are interesting and the game is short enough for this not to be such a critical factor... 
***UPDATE*** Downgraded to a 6. Hasn't seen table time for a long while and not likely to. Unsure why this didn't get sold during my most recent clearout to be honest.

Comprado a mila-spiele.de en medido conjunto en julio del 2010.

Los jugadores son buscadores de oro en el oeste que van a pujar por concesiones mineras. Hay 45 minas y 15 cartas con acciones adicionales. 
Es un juego de subastas puro, con un sistema muy original. Se subasta la opción de ser el primero en escoger una de las cartas disponibles. El que gana la subasta, paga el precio al jugador a su derecha, que se queda con la mitad(redondeada hacia arriba) y el resto lo pasa al jugador a su derecha y así sucesivamente. El ganador es el primero en escoger y después escoge el jugador de la izquierda. Ect. 
Es ligero y fácil de jugar y explicar. El objetivo es acabar la partida con mayor número de puntos (dinero+producción de las minas+alcaldes).
Las acciones adicionales añaden un puntito de puteo al juego. Entretenido y recomendable. Mejor a 5.

Cambiado en Nov2011 en la bsk a jankovicz, junto a la muralla china y el catán de datos, por el Battleground, para jugar con alejandro. De los tres, fue el que más pena me dió cambiar.

Interesting game.  Bidding seems to be a poor play.  I like the conflict between high probability/low points vs. low probability/high points.  In other words, points now or later?  It just depends...

RATING: 7
A colorful game with the theme, but not really too light of a game as one must weigh paying other players for the right to choose first or pass for a later choice and save gold, which are calculated as victory points in the end. The event cards provide some interesting choices between getting immediate gain or going for the mines. The dice rolling infuses a little luck, but this does not dominate play. UPDATE: Dynamite cards can help by reducing the leader's scoring, but must be played right to effect this change or it can have an opposite effect. Same for other event cards, which can make the game somewhat chaotic at times. Game plays well with 3 to 5 players.

I was a bit wary of Boomtown at first since I hate the production mechanism of Settlers of Catan. However, the game focuses on collecting sets and has an innovative bidding system (last person to choose a card gets the most money). Some special cards seem very powerful, so hopefully the bidding should balance them. Positively surprised by this little filler. Not great but fun once in a while.

Two parts: the auction where you have to choose whether you want to pay more and have the first pick of the cards, or pay less and go later in the draft.

In part two dice are rolled and players collect money in the fashion of Settlers of Catan. Good stuff; recommended.

Some luck of the die type stuff going on, but I don't mind that sort of thing at all in my games.

The mayor adds a cool twist to the game, and creates a lot of tension between wanting to keep the color majority for mayor vs. the payoff of other players taking cards of the color you have the mayor in.

Fun auction game to pull out once in a while.

After a learning game, my girlfriend commented: "This is one of my favorite games!"  Two gamer newbies also loved it. Although on first play I was wary of too much luck and chaos, I did pursue a strategy that payed off. I enjoyed the production rolls even when I didn't cash in (even though I find the production rolls in Catan frustrating). My point is that the things I half-expected to be the weak attributes of Boomtown were actually strong points. ///Later, some games have been frustrating; most recently, I was hit with dynamite 3 times, had to bite my lip to prevent "hey I'm not the leader" type of whining. /// Still later, girlfriend reports, "I'm a bit bored with this game, but still willing to play it.

This is a pretty good light card game. The strategy lies in the auction and trying to make sure you get the right mines and don't get stuck paying everybody else. Definitely not a deep thinker, but still something to it. The dice rolls for production give it some luck, but I don't mind it. Over all a good closer game for game nights, etc.

Quite decent. I like the core mechanics a lot. I do have some minor quibbles with some of the non-mine cards (I don't like arbitrarily selecting which player to punish). I also think there just aren't quite enough rolls to make the probability anything close to expected. I play with two rolls per turn instead of once. Rating would go down significantly with 1 roll as written. I play with the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/88847/reduced-randomness]slightly reduced luck[/url] variant.

Components: Very strange finish on the cards; fortunately, it merely makes them difficult to spread out, but flipping, shuffling, and laying them out all work fine. The art is wonderful, the mayor pawns are hefty, and the money chips are functional.

Experience: The novelty of passing money right, but picking left adds a good twist. Whether a person wants to be first to receive the money, or second to pick, can influence how they bid. I enjoy the streamlined production mechanism, in that each mine produces money, rather than a specific sort of good. The mayor mechanism creates an interesting tension between wanting to maintain a majority and wanting others to pick cards of my own color.

Game is a big hit so far.  The major drawback seems to be that if you get off to a slow start and are sitting in just the wrong place in the turn order then it can be near impossible to come back.

This game was chaotic, luck driven, and at times nasty. That being said it was fun! Not a masterpiece of game mechanics but a strong light and fun game. Worth a play. Probably my favorite Faidutti game at this point. Great usage of dice in a euro fashion. 

Last play 8 -> 5. There are a lot of things that I really like about Boomtown. I like the ruleset, theme, and I especially like the payoff mechanic. But, with the number of rolls, there is not enough time for the dice to evenly divide out on its bell curve. What you're left with is a gamble in a mechanic that should end up being balanced. There are too many other similar weight auction games out there for this one for me to be drawn back to this title.

RATING: 8
Boomtown is a light and fast game.  It's enjoyable, but a large part of the enjoyment is based upon the group you are playing with and your like/dislike of being somewhat subject to the whim of the dice.  The bidding mechanic is -Excellent- and I hope to see it implemented in future games.

Comparisons to Settlers of Catan are unavoidable. That's unfortunate because this is probably a very good game but it pales in comparison to SoC. Players have less control in Boomtown and you find yourself just scrabbling around in the dark until the winner is finally revealed. The game also just doesn't have enough eye candy to grab your interest, unlike the bright colours of SoC.

Traded it away because I read the rules stating that the game ends when the deck is "exhausted and exhausted" to literally mean that you go through the deck twice.

RATING: 5.8
A player pointed out that it has similarities to Settlers of Catan, in that you build cities and depending on the roll of the die there are payouts.  When the deck is gone, the one with the most points wins.

The auction is enjoyable because the winning bid is paid out to the other opponents, which gives them more money to beat you in subsequent auctions.

4 of us played  and we all felt the Event cards could have been a little more descriptive such as "play immediately" when it applied.  We found ourselves checking the rules to see how Event cards are used.

I also felt there were too many event cards that threw more uncertainty into the game than I like.  Components nice.

RATING: 6
A fun and simple bidding game where there is a lot going on.  Having played tons of such games, I find the mechanism for wealth redistribution quite ingenious.  There is pratically no down time and you are seldom screwed by not winning a bidding round.  This being a Faidutti game, I feared there had to be a completely broken card that would have a major impact on the game (à la Queen's Necklace).  Perhaps the culprit in this case is the card that allows to take over a mine and attachments which can have a range of nasty impacts.  Since you have to bid for the cards, other players can protect themselves somehow but the effect is still overpowered IMHO.  Regardless, I think the game is highly enjoyable and is worth a try or twenty.

There's just not enough to this game. The action cards are a necessary break from the mines, but they aren't frequent enough, and they don't always appear at useful times.

Ha szerinted a Catan túl komoly játék, amiben nincs elég szerencse, akkor ez a te a játékod. :)
Bányákatra licitálunk, nomeg néhány akciólapra. Minden köt végén dobunk, és az adott számú bányák termelnek. Hasonlóan a catanhoz, itt sincs semmi esélyed, ha pechesek a dobások, adott esetben be tudsz úgy ragadni, hogy már egyáltalán nem tudsz pénzt termelni, csak a többieknek adni.
Egy dolog tetszett benne: a licitálást nyerő játékos után körsorrendben vesszük el a lapokat, tehát a minél közelebb ülsz hozzá, annál nagyobb előnyben vagy, pedig nem fizettél egy fillért se. Ezt kiegyensúlyozandó, a licitet nyerő játékos nem a bankba fizeti a pénzt, hanem a körsorrenddel ellentétes irányba továbbadja, ahol sorban minden játékos leveszi a pénz felét kárpótlás gyanánt.
Ami viszont még nem tetszett: a játék öt fővel nagyon rövid. Így a kockadobások véletlenszerűsége még annyira sincs kiegyenlítve, mint a catan esetén.
Az az igazság, hogy komoly játéknak nem lehet nevezni, viszont partyjátéknak meg nem elég szórakoztató.

Fun, a bit random, and we were overbidding considerably in our first game of this.  Rating may go up, this is a nice little filler with a healthy dose of luck.

I do like it because while it seems like Euro Auction Game #751, the stuff that you can do to other players helps break out of that mold.  Ra is the perfect example of auction game economy, and this is an example of an auction game with some chaos thrown in for good measure.


UPDATE:  Definitely subject to "overbidding" until you've played this enough to see what stuff is actually worth.  But it's a great game to show to casual gamers, and I certainly don't mind sitting down for a game of it myself.  It probably helps that the theme is more attractive than "Trading in the Mediterranean, now auction your silk to impress the provost!" type deals.  

I'll take hot saloon girls over old dudes in puffy shirts and day.  Did Seinfeld teach us nothing?

Ugh. A lot more disappointing than I thought it would be. The bid spreading mechanic I thought sounded really need, but it turned out to be fiddly and probably unnecessary if something a little cleaner could have been figured out. I was very much expecting a light game with a bit of the luck thrown to the dice, but this one felt so random at times, and not just with the dice. The card selection was also terrible random and certain moves that either I made or my opponents made felt forced. And the game lasted way too long. Overall, there is little I can say about this game that I thought was enjoyable.

Wow, this game is so much fun. You really get your moneys worth, for the fun that you'll have with this. Excellent design, really nice big playing cards, tiny poker chips and some nice wooden bits and a pair of dice are what comes with the game. It doesn't sound like much, but it all flows together so nicely, for a highly enjoyable experience.

This is a great game for the family and friends, as it's easy to teach. It may run just a tad long for me, to use as a filler, but would be a good start/end of the night game. I'm so glad that I finally listened to the reviews and got this game and you should too. You won't be disappointed.

Acquired December 2005; first played January 2006. After two games, I like this one. Random luck plays a big factor (cards available in the auction), but careful bidding, card selection, and play of event cards can overcome much of the randomness. Great game for 5 players.

May 2009 -- I still enjoy this game, but our daughter (who usually wins it) really doesn't care for it, so we rarely play it.

October 2011 -- Although our daughter is still not thrilled by this game, she has decided that it is okay to play it occasionally, which we do.

2013-November:  Still a fun game, which we play occasionally.

An auction game mixed with a little Catan-style dice rolling, although this time you are rolling for gold out of one of your mines.  There is also the nice mix of bidding with your money, but in the end it's the person with the most cash that wins.  Dare I say this is like a hybrid of Catan resources gathering and Medici's scoring?  Dare I?  Sure, why not.  Overall, a fun game.

I really, really like some of the design elements here.  The bidding system is a terrific innovation with its balance of cost and benefit among all the players, and the mayorships provide interesting incentives and disincentives to selecting certain colors.  But I hate the way that the production dice rolls can overwhelm the tactics of the bidding, I think the mayorships are much too powerful, and I strongly dislike some of the powerful "take that!" cards.  Despite my middling rating, I would recommend this to anyone who tends to enjoy games from these designers.  It's one of their best, and although I'm not thrilled with it, I'm well aware that I'm not really a part of the target audience.

Boomtown is a fun, atmospheric romp, wherein players must formulate a strategy, seize opportunities when they arise, play the odds, and hope for a bit of luck along the way.  Sometimes your decisions are richly rewarded, while other times lady luck abandons you in favor of an opponent.  Such is the life of a prospector in the old West!  Fortunately, there is far less at stake in this entertaining game!

An auction game with an unusual amount of luck. The dice can be decisive and there are cards that let you choose an opponent to screw. Sitting order may be an issue.

RATING: 7.5
An interesting bidding game, where one tries to win the bid in order to have first pick of available Mining operations and/or cards (Dynamite, Saloon, etc.).

High bid passes the amount he/she bid to the player on his/her right.  Receiving player takes ½ and passes to his/her right, etc.

Then bid winner picks first, followed by the player to his left (clockwise order).

First player to gain a pair of Mines in a color becomes the "Mayor" of that City (color).  Anytime someone picks up a mine, he/she must pay the Mayor of that City (color) $1 per card the Mayor holds in that color.

Makes for an interesting bidding game, where players try to maximize their selection based on the amount of $ their selecting or not selecting a card will bring them.

This is followed by a 2d6 roll, the total indicating which mines produce (similar to Settlers of Catan).

Then you repeat the process until the deck of cards runs out.  Players attempt to take over the Mayor-ship of the various Cities (colors) by having 1 more card of that color.

Points are awarded for each $ + 1 point for each Mine's production capacity + 5 points for each Mayor the player controls.

RATING: 8
This game is infectious. I have yet to win but I really love the bidding/payout/card selection mechanisms. The art work is nice as well. Really worth the money and plays rather quickly. 

Update: This game is not as great with 5 players. I enjoy it still but basically everyone controls one mayor and production is hindered because there are fewer die rolls (more cards consumed in the auctions) and this creates a much reduced economy that adversely affects the auctions. I prefer to see the money flowing in these as it adds a bit to the chaos of the game that way. I'm not always a fan of chaos but for this game it works, I'm sure most of the gold rush miners were not good at budgeting and would blow their cash when they struck gold. For example the saloon card is not really effective if there aren't as many die rolls, and the flavor of the card is lost. So as a 5 player game I say this rates a 6.5 to a 7, but as a 4 player it is easily an 8.

This was a very pleasant surprise (although our first play took well over the suggested 30 minutes). It is an original auction game without any money drain (everything that comes into the game stays in the game), a randomizer concept which makes you play with probabilities (and there are various approaches to that) and a decent amount of interaction. Recommended.
Rules are included in various languages, so the card abilities can be checked there; it is not really necessary to understand the English text on the cards, by the way.

Rating after 1 play (5 players): I didn't like this. It posed no challenge whatsoever. The auction/bidding mechanism didn't seem plausible or rewarding.

Nagyon olcsón vettem, de szerintem nagyon szórakoztató kis kártyajáték, pedig sokaknak nem tetszik. Annyi kártyát csapunk fel középre, ahány ember játszik, ezek lehetnek bányák és különleges akció lapok. Licitálunk azért, hogy ki választhasson elsőnek. Aki elsőnek választ, az a licit pénzt a tőle jobbra ülőnek adja át, aki annak a felét tovább adja, aki szintén tovább adja a felét. A nyertes után viszont a balra ülő választ másodiknak és így tovább. Jól sikerült ez a kártyaválasztás az egyik irányban, pénz továbbadás a másik irányban. Az elvitt kártyát lerakják a játékosok az akciót vagy kijátsszák vagy későbbre tartogatják. 

Aztán dobunk két kockával és akinek olyan értékű a bányája, az termel aranyat. Ezt a kockadobást nem bírják sokan, pedig egy családi játéknál belefér. A játék végén a bányák hoznak pontokat, a megszerzett pénz ér pontot és az akinek többsége van az adott színű bányából (vagyis polgármester). Engem megfogott szeretem játszani, sajnos az akciókártyák némileg nyelvfüggők és a pénz is játék zseton, de a játék hangulata jó.

First played July 19th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (~5min) and medium play (~45 for 4 players).  The game is all about getting gold, of course you have to spend gold and give it to other players to get cards which gets you gold in the end.  It's a nice twist of bidding, dice rolling, and strategy, which seemed to lend it self to a nice mix of luck/strategy.  I'd recommend playing this especaially if you know someone who has it and give it consideration in playing every once in a while to mix things up.

Boomtown is in that same flock of games as Citadels, Bohnanza, and Bang!  It's relatively short, random as hell, but fun nonetheless.  The mechanics are half Settlers and half any auction game out there.  While the passing cards to the left and money to the right mechanic is neat, there are way too many luck based things going on to save it from mindlessness.  The people who say if you don't roll production you don't win are wrong though.  I only produced once in my first game and I won.  Of course, I only won a single auction the whole way through so maybe seating order is the most important part.  The game also has some bash the leader problems, but in the end isn't too bad a moderate filler.

Played once with 5. Overall the game is not very original, but the mechanics of the auction phase are somewhat novel. Although dice are used, the element of chance does not dominate the game. However, it seems difficult to make informed choices regarding cost and benefit. Also, the game was too long. It may play better with fewer than 5, so I'll rate it a 7 for now. Still I suspect Boomtown might become dull after a few plays.......The rating comments about the problem of "lewd" artwork amuse me when the fact that two of the cards illustrate weapons (being used for violent crime) is not even mentioned! This just illustrates the sometimes wide cultural differences between Europe and the US (hint - in most of Europe possession of a weapon is a serious crime, while being half-naked is usually not).

This is a quick auction game that even most nongamers will be comfortable with.  I would definitely recommend playing it with 3 or 4 players.  However, I would caution against playing with 5.  I found that this tends to result in each person specializing in a single town/color and seriously weakens the game.  Whereas with 3 or 4 the bidding is more eventful with players trying to secure multiple mayors. However, this may be a group-specific groupthink issue as others I've spoken with (but not played with) found the game best for five.

This game 'plays itself' and is quite simple, but deeper than it might seem and is widely believed.  Different elements combine togheter very well and create what seems to be a well-oiled mechanism.

EDIT: I've lost the heart for this game.  Now, it seems too random, chaotic and too much out of control to me.  Probably my taste changed (i.e. shifted towards more demanding titles) and hence the change of my attitude towards 'Boomtown' and the rating...

Entertaining game for up to 5 people that plays in about an hour for us.  Also, it is well balanced in that when you win you pass your bid around to those who didn't.

RATING: 6
There's a lot to like about this game; there is no shortage of decisions to be made in the auction and drafting, and it plays in 30 minutes.  I'm not a very big fan of zero-sum area control mechanics like the mayors because of the high frustration factor, but there's no doubt they enhance the decisionmaking in the auction phase.

Randomness is a negative in this game, as it's impossible to plan for given the low number of payouts -- the Settlers problem.

RATING: 7
Based on two plays, this is great fun. Faidutti chaos touches include the Dynamite cards (ouch) and one where you can steal another player's mine (which in one game cost me dearly on the last turn, losing a good card and a mayorship!)

Decent little game.  Wouldn't exactly call it a light game, but it is definately not heavy.  Kind of between light and medium.  Like the money mechanic where the highest bidder doesn't pay the bank but the other players when bidding for the taking of the the first card.

É um dos jogos mais divertidos que tenho. É simples e rápido. Adquire-se minas, e depois procura-se ouro. Claro que podemos sabotar o jogo dos outros e isso ainda é melhor do que encontrar a pepita reluzente. Recomendo.

RATING: 10
Wow !
A perfectly balanced game, that is very fun to play, and that plays fast (~45 min at most). There's just the right amount of luck, but still luck is far from being a determinent factor, it is just here to add some fun. There's also a few event cards, just enough to again add fun without destroying the balance.
And the theme and athmosphere are perfectly rendered.
The rules are easy to teach (only one contentious point: when a player is ruined but is asked to pay someone, there's no debt, the player simply won't pay at this turn).
If you're in the hobby, this game is Kuhhandel meeting the Settlers, but less luck dependent than Settlers, and less pokerish than Kuhhandel.
One of the best (if not the best) german cards games.

A gem .... I mean, a nugget !!

Decent little light game with a dice-rolling for resources mechanic a la Settlers. Saw the pitfalls of overbidding for mines by the guy to my right! I didn't get any of the special cards myself but saw their effects. The dice rolls didn't match my mines well so that kind of hurt.

A filler that is easy to play and teach but I find the game play terribly dry and tedious. The artwork is about the only redeeming aspect of the game. The auction mechanic is okay but the dice rolling just gets annoying.

As long as the game moves quickly, I really enjoy Boomtown.  Some of the cards are pretty cutthroat, but it's all in good fun.  I like the way that the bidding works, and how the choice of cards becomes more restrictive as the game goes on due to the mayors.  Some of the card combinations seem very powerful, but if everyone is familiar with the game, it seems easy to rein in the leader.

A bidding card game with a Settlers-style money generating system. Every turn players bid on mines, then a dice roll is made, and players whose mine matches the dice roll gets money.

Juego de cartas, donde después de una primera ronda de subastas por orden se van escogiendo minas de diferente valor, o cartas especiales. Se tiran dados y las minas que coincidan con la tiradas producen dinero. Las cartas especiales hacen que puedas recibir dinero de otros jugadores,robarles cartas de mina, etc. Hay que saber gestionar el dinero para saber cuando apostar fuerte para elegir una carta o preferir ser el último en escoger pero ser el que más recibe en la subasta. Poder jugar hasta 5 personas y su corta duración (no llega a una hora), además de su sencillez puede que lo conviertan en una buena opción de una tarde.

Quickly became a group favorite, requested from my collection 2-3 times a week. Variants are fun and we commonly play with the double production variant now. We're tweaking house rules because saloons become incredibly powerful with double production.

Overall a wonderful game that is easy to pick up, brings the fun and excitement of poker with some deeper tactics based on board position. Loads of fun and highly recommended.

RATING: 6
It's a really neat lightweight auction cardgame as boardgame and is reminiscent of Citadels.  As with most any game having cards and dice, there is a element of randomness involved but you have some control within this framework.  You want to generate VPs by building mines, saloons, winning mayorships in various towns and using other events cards (like dynamite!) against your opponents'.  There's a neat innovative auction feature:  the winning bid is distributed in counter clockwise fashion while turn order for card selection goes clockwise.  Don't forget that money are VPs as well so you're using VPs to try and generate more VPs.  I've played it with six players IMO it works fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Similar to Settlers in that two dice are rolled to provide production and most cards are mines with numbers and gold coins to indicate how many coins are mined/earned.  Different event cards can be pretty nasty and brutal to other players.  Seemed to take a little long for the type of game it is.  As well, it may not be a family game per se with the art potentially causing a problem for the saloon girls or holdup gal.  Different type of payout system in the auction in that the player to the right earns half the value of the winning bid, the next gets half that, and so on and so forth while play and selection of cards go left.

RATING: 7
Cute light bidding game and majority control game.  Reminds me of Medici in that you bid your victory points (gold) each round to gain items that might score larger bonuses.  Of course the random production element and the take that card play make this game much lighter and less fulfilling.

What can I say? It's a typical Faidutti game. Lots of smart planning, thinking and reading your opponents, but also LOADS of luck.

I like this game.  The components are great and the artwork over the top.  (Dynamite cards.)

RATING: 7
A fun bidding game that is well balanced. Bidding is key here as you must bluff your way to more gold from the others. Mines actually don't produce that often and when they do, they provide little gold. Owning a majority of mines makes you mayor and other players who wish to purchase mines of your color must pay you. This causes some intense competition for mayorship. All in all, a fun game where clever bidding tends to determine the winner.
*UPDATE* We modified the rules to include rolling the dice TWICE for mine production. This simple change makes mines much more lucrative, increases their demand, and thus bidding competition, and makes some of the other cards like saloons/dancing girls/governor cards much more valuable as well!

Just plain silliness. The artwork is great and I love the bidding mechanic. However, I am not a fan of the Settler's-like production rolls. Seems so long-winded... However, most of the game, from the art work, length, and the "take that" game play, make for a pretty fun, chaotic filler. If it could only decide if it wanted to be an auction or producing game!

Overall, a good game; I expect my rating to increase somewhat.  Auctions, majorities, kickbacks ... all fun, but is there enough control?  Probably, maybe the unpredictable nature of mines is the weak part.  See the discussion: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/51234

Pros: Light, atmospheric game. Mechanics fairly well integrated, little downtime, generally fun to play.
Cons: Lots of luck. Not so bad since it doesn't last very long, but could turn off some people.
Verdict: Good, unpretentious, ideal with a boisterous, fun crowd . Just have fun, don't worry too much about winning :)

Light auction game with a Settlers of Catan production mechanism.  Good for newbies.  I liked this a lot the first time I played but the second time I got destroyed & I can't see how I could have played better.  Still, not bad for a light game ... some strategy, tactics & bidding.

This simple and clever little card game has players bidding for mines in the race for the most gold at the end of the game. There’s some nice mechanics in this game that is unique and interesting. At the beginning of the round, cards are turned over and players bid for the right to chose first. The winning player pays his/her player to the left the amount of the highest bid. The player receiving then takes the amount and keeps half (rounded up) and passes the rest to the next player to the right, and so on. The player who won the bid then selects a card then the player on his/her left gets to choose the second card, and so on. This is probably the most interesting and novel dynamic in this game that provides a nice balance and control. After all players have acquired a card dice is rolled to determine which mines produce gold. There are also mayors of towns which get gold every time a new mine is selected as part of the same town (identified in colors). Mayor tokens are given to players who have the most mines from the same town (color). Finally, there are also cards that have specific and special effects.

The game is light, simple, easy to explain and plays fast. The game ends after the deck is depleted. There are some nice and unique mechanics to this little card game and it’s worth a look. No deep strategies, never the less still fun and enjoyable.

RATING: 7
An interesting auction game with a random element introduced by the dice determining which mines payout. Allows you some ability to gamble on the dice. Do you build lots of mines of the same number so that when the dice roll that you get a big payout, or do you build different numbered mines to try and get a more regular payout? Either way you shouldn't let someone else get too many mines of the same number because if the dice favour them they'll be hard to beat.

And while it's fun to be mayor don't over pay to retain it. Remember the end game.

Boomtown is a bidding game with some strategy and good amount of luck.  I like how the winning bid is dispersed among the other players instead of going to the bank.  The "special" cards add a bit of spice to the game as well.  This is definitely a winner with the right group of people.

Update: Bumping this up to a "7" after a few more plays.  It's always a hit on our couple's gaming nights.

Based on 1 play.  Pretty fun and enjoyable.  Would like to try it again.  Seems like there might be a lot there with the auction mechanism.  Didn't quite get my head around the strategy one time through.

Light and Fun! The auction system is a little different but very good and the production phase is dice-based "a la Catan". It has some luck on the card drawing and the dice-rolling but nothing can beat the feeling of blowing your enemies' mines with the dynamite. ;-)

RATING: 7.5
This is a nice, fairly simply bidding game with a nice dose of set collection. You're always weighing up how much cash is worth sacrificing for a gain. It's still fairly light with the dice rolls triggering income, but short enough that this doesn't really 'ruin' anything. The box is small enough and the game quick enough that I see no reason to ever part with it (unless the Polish Pirate re-theme is released in English maybe).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Boomtown is an auction game where you bid for mines to produce gold (money).  You get points at the end for having mines, money and control of particular towns.  It's a hard balance to maintain, because you must spend gold to bid on mines, but victory is based on how much money you have in your hand at the end.

The mines produce gold through a Settlers of Catan style of dice rolling.  The mines with the number rolled produce gold that round.  

Overall this game is fun to play, but won't see many plays because I have games that are better.

Strategic bidding seems to be the key to this game, not only to get the cards you need but in forcing up the bid to earn additional income. Also need to balance use of Action Cards against acquiring mines. A light game overall, but with enough choices to keep it interesting.

Fun introductory bidding game. Does have some problems, particularly for the player to the left of a low-ball bidder. This happened to my wife during one game and really turned her off to it...I passed on pretty much everything, so she never got any good second picks, and usually got second to last pick.

RATING: 5
The mechanic of distributing money and cards in opposite directions is clever.  That said, there's too much randomness in this game, or not enough - hard to be sure.  This can be like playing Settlers, but with only 12 rolls - most resources wins.  That's not nearly enough to get close to an even distribution, meaning die rolls will dictate the results more than anything else.

All THAT said, it's still fun and quick enough to overlook the lack of control in one's standing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy game that's prone to some backstabbing, aggressive bidding and hollering at the dice rolls (not at the level of Manila or Kingsburg of course).  Set in the Wild West with the subject of mining, and even having saloons and whores, this game just spells fun.

UPDATE:  Must try out the variant of rolling two sets of dice.

UPDATE 2: Light game, but plays well with four.  Two sets of dice variant is pretty good.

[b]Boomtown[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR] 

[i]Boomtown is a fun push your luck game that combines set collection, auctions and some take that; in the game you are bidding on mines which may provide gold and there are also take that cards which increase the player interaction. If you have majority in a mine you get the mayor pawn of that color and other players need to pay you when collecting income from their mines that are the same color as your mayor. The game works well, but I think you need a full five players [i](we only played with three)[/i] in order to get the most out of the auctions and potential player interaction [i](some cards can be quite nasty)[/i]. I would definitely play it again, but it wouldn't replace other filler games I have for higher player counts. Still it's a testament to the game play that it still holds up 13  years later.[/i]

RATING: 7.8
Fun game. Light enough to be played as a gateway game, but has some interesting decisions for gamers mostly in the way the bidding works with the person to the winning bidders left getting half that amount and so on then the person to the right gets second pick of the cards. I like how all the cards are gathered through auctions so the luck of the card draw is minimized. Played with clay poker chips instead of the small plastic ones it came with and it added to the experience. Can't wait to play it again. I'm surprised this game didn't get more love when it was released. I do enjoy it more with the variant where the dice are rolled twice after the bidding phase instead of once.

RATING: 6
An auction game where you're trying to get majorities in colours, which will allow you to draw fees from other players each time they take a card in that colour. After that, try and get lucky with the card drafts so that you don't have to pick up too many duds, and hope the player to your left doesn't win too many auctions so you're continually picking last. The neat mechanic of passing money to the right, getting cards through the left, is an attempt at compensating, but there's still only so many auctions you can afford to win ... especially when the money you're spending is victory points. Decent occasional fun for 4 or 5 players, but the vagaries of who wins the other auctions (and when) dictates a lot of your result so you can't take it too seriously.

Light auction games that is perfect for new gamers: everybody gets a card each round, some money goes to all the 'losing bid' players, plays fast, and the event-card text is very short (albeit sometimes a bit unclear as to meaning).

A simple game with enough interaction and ideas to make it slightly better than other efficiency engine games (RFTG / San Juan). The interaction is there, players' income is partially dependent on what other players do, are they building mines in your town, using your bar etc. The theme is plastered on but it works fine, alas, it is a bit too cartoonish for me but that does not matter much. Not a bad filler that is. HX

Much more fun and interesting than expected.  Lots of thought required to decide your best choice on a round, and how much to bid for it, since the variations in the cards and how they relate to the current situation makes the 'best' choice far from obvious.  Will play this again with no hesitation.

There are several things I like about this game: the card art, the Wild West theme, the bidding/money mechanic, and the chaos introduced by the event cards.

Boomtown isn't exactly a balanced game, and the rulebook could use a little work, but there is something very satisfying about the player interaction here.

Boomtown é um jogo divertido, com ligeiros traços de “Modern Art” e forte cheiro a “Descobridores de Catan”. A parte dos leilões é engraçada e permite um certo parasitismo, bem como uma grande dose de bluff… A produção mineira não justifica muito o custo a pagar pelas minas, nem mesmo o Sallon ou o Mayor (até com o Governour), pelo que uma boa táctica para vencer o jogo é procurar ficar ao lado direito de um comprador compulsivo! Repito: É um jogo divertido, mas ganha o mais feliz (sortudo) e não propriamente quem jogou melhor!

Tentative rating of a game I won by a margin of around 40 points mostly by not winning auctions. I suspect there was gross overbidding involved.  I'll have to play further before I settle on a final verdict. *** Won second game too, by a smaller margin. Obviously a game requiring great skill, so an uprating is in order. I like the fact that there are lots of fine judgements to be made, even though the rules are simple. Well themed.** I've reduced my rating again as I think there are problems of control.

This game has a lot of very nice mechanisms that work well together; it's a shame that the completely broken production mechanism from Settlers ruins an otherwise decent game.  12 rolls of 2d6 is not nearly enough for the luck to balance out.  There is a good game in here that could probably fight its way out with a house rule for this, though.

Good, light fun. The mechanics are clever and the playing is engaging. Well worth taking a copy on holidays and playing with all levels and types of gamers. The valuation behind it all, of what cards are worth how much to who, keeps you occupied. Plays really well with five. Just for fun.

Players try to gain profit out of the gold fever in the Old West.  The right to choose first between the different mine grants and cards is auctioned, but the bid must to be paid to the rivals, starting with the one seating on the right, according to an original system.  If a player has the majority of mines in a town, he/she becomes the Mayor, allowing to charge a fee for every mine grant in that place and adding some extra points at the end of the game.  There are also a couple of events cards, besides the mines, that adds some variability to the game.  The game is chaotic, as a Faidutti's, so it's hard to achieve a strategy here, just have fun until the last card is drawn.

Erdekes mechanizmus. Egy kicsit bele van keverve a Catan kockadobalos resze. A licit resze is egyedi, mas-mas jatekos kapja meg a kartyhuzas elonyet illetve a nyertes jatekos altal felajanlott licit osszegbol az osztalekot. Az akcio kartyak annyira nem bolonditjak meg az egeszet, azaz egeszseges gonoszsagra lehetoseget adnak (Faidutti jatekoknal ez ritka, mert altalaban valogatott gonoszsagokkal tomi tele a jatekait) de a megfelelo mertekeken belul.

It's a solid, solid "fun" game. Yes, there's chaos...but it's Bruno, so what do you expect? It's short, so the randomness and the chaos isn't overwhelming. The theme is well-integrated here. And the auction is so interesting; what a great idea...and it makes for a really tense bid. Fun. (I do suspect the Governor is overpowered. Might have to make a house rule about a finite term length.)

This is fun!

Clever auction game with a sort of area control that makes sense, controlled chaos and luck and really intense interactive environment (for an auction game). The dramaturgy is very interested as at first you're thinking about what you want and later about what you want to avoid. And take that elements and all that works because it's within the auction system. And an interesting one at that - winner gives most of the money to losers. 

Problem: abysmal graphic design. Too dark, too murky. The Polish redesign of it as a pirate game (while good looking) seems not as good thematic fit for this game. Heck, but I'll probably want it anyhow.

Love the bid/payment mechanisms but hate the Settlers-like dice-dependent payment once a turn. Governor card also seems broken (especially when it comes out late - player collected 24 gold in one turn) and not enough saloons. A shame. Hopefully someone will use the good stuff for a better game or just fix this one on the reprint. Played a strong game by simply not winning a single bid.

A great little game. Played one 3-player game. The rules suggest removing 15 cards for a shorter game, which we did. Afterwards we decided it would have been better to play with the full deck.

The cardstock has a curious finish, which makes them slippery in an odd kind of way, and difficult to shuffle and deal. My rating for the game slipped 0.5 due to this. Rating after my first game: 7.0.

Ez ugyan csak év játéka díj jelölt volt, de milyen óriási különbség van közte és a Café International között így ugyanakkor kipróbálva. Ez a játék több sebből is vérzik. A játékosok bányákat szereznek meg különböző városokban, amik Catan módjára termelnek aranyat. A játék egyetlen újdonsága számomra a licit végén beadott pénz elosztása a licit vesztesek között. Akinek adott városban több bányája van, ott ő lesz a polgármester, aki újabb ilyen városi bánya megszerzése után pénzt kap a tulajtól, aki csak több bánya után veszi át a polgármesteri címet. A játék fő baja a szerencsefaktora. Szinte csak az van neki. Szerencse, hogy milyen bányák vannak a pakliban, ugyanis kevesebb játékos esetén ki kell venni lapokat. Lehetne esetleg ezt csökkenteni úgy, hogy a kivett lapokat mindenki láthatja, de így igazából ötlet sincs megéri polgármesternek lenni vagy gyorsan el tudják majd venni. Vannak a bányákon kívül különböző eseménylapok, amik között szemétkedő is van, így valószínűleg hárman játszva a legrosszabb a játék. Szerencse a kockadobással való termelés és az is, amilyen lapok éppen az adott körben a licitre kerülnek. Nagyon nem mindegy milyen típusú játékos mellett ül az ember, lehet semmit nem kell csinálnia és mindig másodiknak választhat a random felkerülő lapok közül. Van egy erős, aki vezet egyre jobban áll faktora is a játéknak. Szóval nagyon nehéz jó dolgokat találni, sajnos nekem nem is sikerült. Biztosan jobb 5-en a játék, 3-an katasztrofális volt.

I've only played this with three.  Another classic case of a game company expanding the number of players on a box beyond the game's capability in order to encourage people to buy it.  Well let me be the voice of reason!!!  Welcome to the era of the internet where people read about the experiences that others had playing the game rather than picking up a game on impulse at a store.  If a game only plays 5 players just put "5" on the box or whatever!  It is a niche market we all buy way too many games.  I have a ton of three player games that work well.  I don't need to waste my time playing a game that pretends to be for three player, just because it technically works.  

That said Boomtown is a decent auctioning game whose card selection system works better in Industrial Waste.  In general, the choices are all pretty obvious. of course, this may be a circumstance of a three player game.  For the most part, anything you get is going to be alright and it is better to get a piece of the bid (victory points) than it is to pay them out.  The only reason to ever bid is to not get something.  It sure seems that there is a lot more fun to be had with this game with more than three people.  I'm hoping to get in  a session. 

Another thing, game companies please take note, finish the rules before you translate them into 5 different rulebooks. So many unanswered circumstances, give some examples for us please. (4 with 3 players I'm thinking it will be a 6.5 with 4 or 5 players).

I've played many times and have yet to win, but this is a fun game. I don't understand why people complain about the luck of the dice! The theme is gold mining in the 1800s! In my last game my mines only paid off twice (for a total of about 6), but I still came in second so there are other ways to do well. EDIT: I finally won, grabbing the Dangerous Mines early in the game and they never blew up. EDIT: Upped my rating by 1 after repeat playings. It's a fun thematic game that includes whores and dynamite!

A nice mix of Settlers (d6 production rolls) and auction games. Very nice, interesting auction mechanism, although I wonder if a once-around version would be better. Plays quickly, too. The special cards can be pretty powerful, but the auction mechanism should help balance that. One caveat - I think you need to play with people who all know the game; one (or a few) under/over-bidders may mess things up for the people on either side of them.

A fun combination of Settlers style dice rolling and an interesting auction mechanism.  There's a good amount of luck, but it could be a good one for both serious and casual gamers.

We rotate taking turns going first, so there's no bidding (I often skip my turn to go first to even things out) and we just count gold in hand to see who wins.

This certainly has some nice ideas, but overall, the execution fails. I can stand a bit of randomness, if there is a way to play around it.

Quicky, random filler. In theory I like all the parts of this game, but in practice the game is too short for the mine production mechanism to work well: not only is it highly random, there aren't enough rolls to guarantee any kind of reasonable spread, so most mines will never pay off; mayoralties dominate the strategy.

Not awful, but no desire to play again.

[F2F 2005 edition] {Gold digging, filler; dice-rolling, bidding, utility cards; optimal 5p} Boomtown is a nice family game. It is fun and has strong player interaction. It's fast-paced, dynamic and with high replayability. Sometimes, players need to make quite tough decisions: how much to bid, which cards to select and what is the good time to play some event cards. As a filler, the depth of decisions is just right: neither too deep nor too shallow.

Boomtown has a unique bidding mechanic: the highest bidder shares his bid to his opponents in counter-clockwise direction, while cards are selected in clockwise direction. In this way, all players should gain card and/or gold each turn.

EV of each town varies during the game, which makes Boomtown fun and dynamic. Some event cards are powerful but I don't think Boomtown is unbalanced because each card can be countered by another. It'll become unbalanced if a player is allowed to get a handful of event cards easily.

I was hesitant about buying Boomtown at first because I read some bad reviews about it. Finally, I bought it in a clearance sale of a FLGS and I don't regret buying it because it's really a nice game and meets my expectation (provide fun and decisions in 30 minutes).

I don't find the luck of dice roll highly irritating because players still have certain control (choose card wisely, get money in the bidding, event cards, etc.) and there are other ways to score even with bad dice rolls. I think the bad reviews exaggerate the effect of bad rolls. Players should carefully calculate the risk in bidding and selecting cards. With good calculation, luck is not a big problem in Boomtown. Nevertheless, one thing worries me much is that the few number of dice rolls in 5p game. There are only 12 rounds of play; i.e. 12 dice rolls. Therefore, particular run of dice roll will greatly benefit some players. I agree with CurtC that 2 dice-rolls per turn is a good variant of play.

[Expansion] Seems some interesting cards will be added. Hope that it will be released in a booster pack so that we can have these cards in a reasonable price.

[6p variant] The 6p variant works (as stated in Faidutti's page). It maintains the fun and tense without increasing game length. Thus, Boomtown can be a good choice for a group of 6 players.

Cards are revealed and players bid to be the first to choose their card.  I like how players who choose last are rewarded with more money which balances things out nicely.  Lots of good decisions that are only slightly marred by a relatively high luck factor (typical in a game by the two Brunos).  Rolling the dice twice each round instead of once seems to even out the luck a bit (good suggestion CurtC).  Packaging and bits are first rate.

This was pretty good.  It wasn't great, but the bidding mechanic was very interesting to see.  And there was a little bit of take that along with a whole bunch of luck, mainly because the dice rolls are very minimal and can be quite a big difference one way or the other.  But it was short enough to still be quite a bit of fun.

In any case, I'm done with the game.  If someone else has it, I might play it sometime, but I won't seek out a game of this.

I love dice rolling and messing with people (and being messed with), so I am sure I will play this one a lot more.

Dice and auctions are a good combo for me, plus the theme and playtime make this pretty easy one to get to the table.

Update: More plays and more fun. Rating moves up from 7 to 7.5.

I do wish the art focused less on breasts. I think it can be off-putting when playing with some adults and embarrassing with kids.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

I had alot of fun with this.  Very light, party type atmosphere game.  I'm not sure about replayability, but I'm not tired of it yet.  Easy decisions, but its creates fun interactions between the players.  Better games that feel the same out there, but a nice change of pace.

Years have passed since my 1 play and really have no desire to have a second play.

This game is as fun as I thought it might would be.  I really enjoy it and per the rating system will be suggesting it and will not turn down a game ever. I can't see playing it over and over again back to back...more of a filler/warmup game so it's not a 10 as it's not THE game I'm there to play every night but I will never turn down a game of this.  After many many plays so far I gotta say I love it more and more. 

UPDATE:
This game still rocks my socks.  I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've played this and there is no way I'd ever consider changing my rating.  I would suggesting reading in the variants section the "New bid payout and card selection mechanic" as I like this a lot and even give some consideration to the double production roll at the end of each turn.   In addition I am working on a variant myself to add a little bit of new spice to the game.  Not that it needs it mind you but I like variants so why not?

UPDATE: Well it's been several years now and I feel I can comfortably bring the rating down a tad on this one. I still enjoy the game but if it's not hitting the table anymore often than it is then it should not be a '9'.

Have taught this to a couple of groups, the last of which whined throughout the first couple of rounds because "this is too hard".  When we finally finished, they immediately requested to play again, and a couple of them have not quit commenting on how much fun it was.

A really good auction game this one appears to be. With only one play so far, I cannot say for sure, but after playing hundreds of games, you start to get a pretty solid feel about a game, specially one as straight foward as Boomtown, even after only one play.

I liked the way the money passes to the players on the right, but the choice of the cards goes to the left of the winning bidder (after he/she chooses, of course). This makes for interesting choices all the way - in this first play, one of the player didn't won a single auction and came in a close second, only a few coins behind (one or two numbers above in a roll of production and he could have won). Not only this, but also these rules make the money [u]stay in the game[/u] - this is important to make the auctions grow higher and fiercer, which is great and is the core of a good auction game.

The artwork, though not really eye-opener, is funny and well made. This bits are... meh, not top notch quality, not bad also.

Our play lasted for more than 30 minutes, and I can see that being usual, but not much more: 40 to 45 minutes might seem to be the proper playing time for us. Not filler-time, but can surely work as a game night opener or closer.

Plays nice and fast, good auction dynamic, some fun / agonising choices here and there. Plays well with three (with 15 random cards removed as per the optional rule). Rating likely to rise I'd say.

RATING: 7
Good bidding game.  I was a bit disappointed that there was only one Saloon in the whole deck (makes having two markers in each color seem a little excessive) and the game wasn't really close.  We played with 3, this might be a much better game with 4.

The production system does not work well, as 12-20 die rolls are not nearly enough to give a reasonable distribution.  If I play the game again, I will pretend that the mines never produce and concentrate on mayorships, which appears to be where the real game is.

RATING: 8
Good looking game with quality components. Nothing spectacularly original (auction, action cards, Settlers-style income), but it works and I like it! Probably best with five, but in my opinion it works just fine with three or four players. Good game for casual gamers (though my gamer friens like it too) and perfect as a filler with simple to explain rules. Played 10  times.

Bruno Faidutti's fingerprints are all over this game. Main elements of Citadel are found interspersed within Boomtown. There is almost always a certain sense of chaos mixed with ambiguous tactical elements that makes the game so tough to grasp and so hard to find a winning strategy. Still, the game has its charm. The reverse distribution of money allows a slow accumulation of wealth over time to be redistributed within a closed monetary system. This redistribution is somewhat dependent on the personalities of players and the risk taking nature of some folks makes player order quite important. Love it or hate it, Fadutti's games usually evoke palpable tension during some form of role selection that is often heightened by some delicious and unexpected screwage and backstabbing.

I was really expecting to love this game.  After reading the rules, it seemed elegent and interesting.  Now that I've played it, it was definately interesting.  I love the multiple ways to get income, and I think it will take a while to learn the best ways to learn and balance the possible strategies.  Unfortunately, it did not seem as elegant as the reading of the rules indicated.  It felt a little fiddly and it didn't play as quickly as I had hoped, but it was just one play.  If the next game goes more smoothly, then this rating will go up.

A Settlers-like game of mining. Similar to Settlers, you can end up going a few rounds without being able to do something. Fortunately, the way purchasing mines work (pass the payment to the player to your right who then takes half and passes it on) makes sure you are rarely without money. Has quite a 'take-that' spirit to it with some of the cards.

I don't care for this game.  The dynamite card is designed as a defensive move, but really hurts you (because you don't get a mine while you are dynamiting someone else's AND because you become a target later in the game).  

The best cards (saloon saloon girls) are the worst, because they focus all the attention on you, and you'll be dynamited for the rest of the game.

First play - 5 players - A great theme. Bid on being the first to select from 5 cards on the table. Usually they are mines but there are some special cards as well. Get 2 of the same color mine and become mayor of that town. Mayors collect money from others opening new mines in their city. The special cards are Dynamite, Saloon, card shark, etc...
After each round roll the dice and see who gets paid. Lots of luck and TAKE THAT! going on but a fun, light game none the less.

This is a really fun tongue and cheek game. I really like the bidding mechainic it has, it was very orginal for me. 

I would have bought this one if any copies were left, but I think it flew off the shelf. 

The art on the cards is great and the cards are on really thick stock. 

Although this is a simple game, some might find some of the cards kind of suggestive. The girl on the HOLD UP card really doesn't need a gun to take my money... ;p

There's gold in them thar hills!
\13\\13\
In Boomtown, you start as a gold digger and try to end as a tycoon.
\13\\13\
To do this, you must first buy the best mining concessions, hoping to find gold veins. You can also try to become the Mayor of Whiskey River or San Narciso, in order to get a small cut on concessions sales, or build a saloon where lucky prospectors will spend their nuggets in moonshine whiskey. If business is really bad, you can still rely on bank or stagecoach hold-ups to reestablish you. A well placed stick of dynamite can also solve some minor problems.

RATING: 7
Clever auction game in which the choice of goods moves clockwise while money spent on the auction moves counter-clockwise. Since having the most money is the only thing that matters in the end, you can sometimes manipulate auctions with the player to your left so that you end up with a bigger chunk of his or her money.

The game moves quickly, which means that the die rolls don't always hit a bell curve, which means that mine production numbers shouldn't be your first priority when bidding and choosing cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

fun bidding game. I like the concept of how the money is divided and how the payouts work.  Having the risk of the mine blowing up is cool too.  I think its a cool filler bidding game that gives me an old western poker feel.

Have not played it yet. Have opened the box and looked at the components though, the cards are laminated with some sticky material and cling together.  I put them in card protectors (standard ones won't fit, the cards are too tall) and now they handle easier, however they don't fit in the box insert anymore.

Having players benefit from another player's high bid is just genius.

The nasty stealing and explosion cards would be unbalanced in an "I-just-drew-a-great-card, take that" game, but here their inclusion is tense and thoughtful because their use (as is everything in the game) is tied to winning an auction - or helping someone to your right win an auction.

I would be remiss if I didn't state that the card art is outstanding, which is something that I rarely notice or even care about.  Too bad the game is permanently out of print and the long-promised expansion was never released.

Simple bidding game in which players are bidding to pick first from the available mine and special cards. The twist that makes this game brilliant, is that the highest bid is paid to the player on the winners right, who keeps half and passes the rest on counter-clockwise.

Bidding system has its merits; mental math is required to determine how much to bid, before also considering how much you'll be paid if someone else wins and how many VP's you'll drop if you get, say, third pick instead of first. However the strategy is transparent and the Settlers roll-collect mechanic is horrendous. Expect wonky statistics and lots of impossible retroactive determinations like "that 11 was actually worth fifteen points because we rolled two of them, while the 6 I selected instead was worth less because we never rolled any."

Not to be taken too seriously, but good, solid entertainment - more targeted nastiness than Citadels has. Ingenious auctioning mechanic, where outbidding can simply be too expensive: do I want to pay 9 or recieve 4 gold.

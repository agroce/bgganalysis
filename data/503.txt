I enjoy this game but don't play much as my boyfriend isn't too keen on abstracts. Plays best for us with 3 or 4 players - more and we tend to limit each other too much. Who can resist the little pastel "candy" camels?This game just looks different than the others in your collection and the camel-shaped pieces seem to appeal more to casual gamers then geometric bits or chits do. While it probably won't be the favorite in your collection, it's definately a good addition!

The Kosmos "big box". Great game - although it has a very abstract feel. Multiple paths to victory, tight, non-gamer friendly, great with 2 and somewhat chaotic with 4+ players. DON'T EAT THE CAMELS!

A very fun and surprisingly tactical area control game.  There are several ways to earn VPs, and because of all the player interactions you have to be ready to change plans all the time.  Longest camel trains seem to be critical for victory.

RATING: 10
Very clever, deep, not-too-long, tactical, pastel-coloured-camel-fest, which benefits hugely from the fun theme, the small plastic palm trees and a quality FFG production. The fact that RK originally conceived this as golf-course-design contest(!!) says a lot about his fabled lack of flair when it comes to themes!

Got this in the math trade.  Haven't gotten to give it a play yet, but I'm anticipating it being a success.  Seems like a fairly solid Euro and the pastel camels are top notch.  

Got a game with three in.  Played pretty fast and the pieces are fun--the game was also really close, with first place 93, second 87, and third 85.  

Meh, boring. Traded it for something and then again for Rogue Trooper.

Owned, but one of the few Knizia games I've never played. It sits on the shelf... beaconing. Yet I refuse. It's not the tasty pastel camels, I assure you.

Update: Wow. This title does absolutely nothing for me. I am amazed, as I'm a fan of Reiner's games, but I simply couldn't bear to play this again for some reason. Perhaps I'm missing something important, but I sincerely doubt it.

Juego muy sencillo y corto, pero entretenido. Otro de Knizia. Añades camellos creando rutas de caravanas, en el tablero exagonado, y recoges puntos por los pozos, los oasis que bordeas, y si encierras rodeando, una parte del tablero, recoges todos los puntos de dentro de la zona. Está graciosete pero como filler y poco más.

Good fun.  In one way, it reminds me a little of Cathedral, in that you can enclose areas and have to think hard about which order you go for your priority plays.  A good thing about this is that women love it.  I don't know if it's the pastel coloured camels or the fact that you have to think of many things at once (aren't women supposed to be multi-taskers?)  Anyway, it's fun as well as a good "thinker."

I really like this game after a few plays.
The more I play this game, the more I like it.

However, neither of my daughters (7 and 9) will play it.  I will introduce it again after some time.  

It plays well with 2, but also with 3 or 4.  I have not tried it with 5.

Reglas sencillas de entender, juego dificil de dominar, partidas siempre diferentes, sin azar. ¿Qué más podemos pedir?

Aún y así, para mí, un "must have".

Basically an abstract game with a pasted on theme.  I'm not much into abstracts, but this works.  Fun game, very easy to learn, plays quick (30-45 minute), very strategic.  If there is a downside, it would be possibility of analysis paralysis, but this could be said of hundreds of games.

RATING: 7
A very nice, fun, light game.  Players take turns placing candy camels on the board, scoring points.  Game ends when all camels of one color are gone.  Extra points are awarded for placing the most camels of a color.  There's clearly strategy involved, but gameplay isn't that deep or complex.  During/after my second play, it started looking like a min/maxing kind of game.  Light, easy and fun, but not deep enough to really hold me.  Good medium-length filler.  Also a good introductory game.  We call them candy camels because of the pastel colors (they are NOT edible).  I recommend trying it - it really is excellent filler for (at least) occasional play.

RATING: 7
1st play: This may be my new favorite Knizia game.  Right up there with Ra mechanics-wise and more appealing to look at.  Area control Go-style game that's much faster, easier to jump into, and supports up to 5.  Balancing between controlling areas of the board, touching Oasis, and stealing water tiles is fun and creates difficult decisions.  My only real complaint is that the green and blue camels are a bit too similar in color, and I usually have no problems with color.

2nd play: All the paths seem roughly equal in strength, there's a lot of opportunity to block and outplay others, with tension about which objective to pursue.  It feels similar to Go, but plays 4 and with the palm trees and bonus tiles, helps simplify where to place your attention.

As long as you dont play it all the time, its a pretty nice light tactics game. A lot of variety because of the different ways to score points and camel colours. No difficulties regarding the distinguishability of the colours. Extra point for beautiful cover+board+material. May be an abstract but doesnt feel like one. My first Knizia game, I wonder if the others are as likeable as this. 3 or 4 players recommended.

The importance of the "place your camels" round at the beginning is crucial. If you let others get huge territories or many oasis points without conflict, you better have that advantage as well. After about 10 plays it got a little "samey" but because of the beautiful cover and box of the german version I'll keep it.

Fast game. Lot's of strategy and no random factor, which makes the game a bit dry.
What I don't like is the setup which can take as much time as the game itself.
EDIT: I just don't see the appeal anymore. There is just so many better games so this isn't played very often anymore. Rating dropped 7->6.

This was a very enjoyable game, it has nice components and it just felt and looked nice whilst playing. It came across like it was a combination of abstract and train game mechanics all melded into one. It didn’t feel dry to me like I’ve seen a few people comment. The theme worked well but that is coming from an abstract fan. There are lots of ways to score and lots to think about. It is a solid game with elements of Go.

After a 3p game and two 2p games, I'm convinced that Through The Desert is a highly enjoyable game with lots of depth crammed into a short play time. I don't think I'll try too hard to play good, though. A lot of the charm comes from how quick to play it is and I don't want to ruin it by thinking a minute before every move. All said and done, this'll hit the table often.

Very, very clever game. It's all there in front of you. The decisions seem obvious until the very moment you got to make the play...then second thoughts. Agony. then you decide to just screw the other player...or...wait a sec. No, maybe that's a better play. A game with terrific choices.

RK does some territory control.  Fun, oh yes, it will be fun, and it is, provided you aren't color blind.  I have played this one lots, and it feels good, almost ponderous and slow, matching the theme.  However, the big fault is despite being such a simple game, it can get tedious, their is a lot numbers and colors to keep track of, for a family game.  But, now that I play it on my ipod touch, I can enjoy it as it is, without the confusing mixes of player colors, camel color, counting the longest chains for each color, and etc, etc.

Great game.  The rules are simple enough to play with people who wouldn't normally play a boardgame (provided they are willing to think about moves).  The restricted board size for small numbers of players keeps the game interesting with three.  I also enjoy how the victory point tokens for the watering holes (FFG reprint) have a blank side so it's not quite known how many points each player has (which keeps people from feeling like they are too far from the lead to keep playing).

I've been happy with this purchase because it provides a rather unique experience.

It's a good medium-weight three player game.  It's more complicated than the pure fillers, but not as complex as most others.  The rules are simple and easily explained and the game plays quickly.

The game play is deep for it's playing time, but even better the problems are spacial and luck-free, which is a good contrast from what most other games offer.

Really, it's very much like an abstract in this sense (which isn't my favorite genre), but it doesn't feel like a true abstract.  The theme works pretty well, and, at least with 3 players, there's just enough uncertainty about what will happen before it's your turn again that you can calculate but not too deeply.

The game got's its title because of how dry it is.  If the extremely arid nature doesn't turn you away then you will find a respectable game buried inside.  Game play can be a real brain-burner, and analysis paralysis is par for the sand-trap laced course.  Normally, this style of game would rank higher, but it really is just a bit too dry and lifeless.  There is a good game in there, but the packaging and experience detract from it.  [GTI Code: APSD]

RATING: 6.5
It's a nice game, with rules incredibly simple for such a deep game. The components are top-notch, and they even entice non-gamers to give it a try.

Which is not recommended, by the way. This can be a really mean game, and quite unforgiving for newcomers.

And here relies the only downfall of the game. While it meets most qualities to a great game (plays quick, easy to learn, nice bits), the actual learning process is very, very steep.

I like to play it, but it's really difficult to play it with people at my own level... if introduced to newbies, I'll trounce them. If I play with experienced players at Ludagora, they'll trounce me.

UPDATE: Still a nice game, but no longer one I'd usually want to play. Down to a 6.5.

Initial Rating based on 3 games.  I kinda like it.  I am not sure if I like it a lot.  Will see with more plays.  It is a good game and willing to play more.  I do not like this game with 4 players at all.  For me this is specifically for 2-3 players and that's it.  Too much player chaos which changes the board too much before it is your turn.  With 2-3 players that is mitigated and you can somewhat plan ahead.

Simple rules, pretty colors, and lots of aggressive posibilities- I like it! The main objective is to maximize your points every turn, but you also need to take certain risks for possible great rewards. The trick is knowing when to apply pressure. A good time is when the player you are pressuring has another critical move he must make, therefor letting you achieve your plans. You also need to take the points you are in most danger of losing first, while leaving safe plays for last. Lots of depth to this little game.

Although my wife hates this game, I do quite well, and maybe that's one reason why I like this offering.  My buddy introduced it to us, and right off the bat I could see the genious of the game.  Placing camels to score as many points as possible, while trying to stymie your opponents' encroachments into your territories and keeping all caravans somewhat balanced are clever mechanisms.  To have a chance at winning, you definitely have to have the longest caravan in at least two colors...at least that's what we've discovered.  Don't own it as of yet, and don't even know if my wife would let it in the house, but Through the Desert definitely classifies as a fun ride. Update:  Received as gift for Father's Day.  [Gift]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
Knizia has made some of the best semi abstract multiplayer strategy games out there and Through the Desert is an excellent game in that genre.  I like Samurai and Tigris more but this manages to compliment the other two well being lighter, and possibly appealing to different people.  It is a tiny step up from ticket to ride and has those elements in it.  There is no luck although you are at the mercy somewhat of how the motivations of other players evolves.  People have discribed this as go-lite but it has more rules than go and is very much its own animal.  2 pages of rules it plays out well

[i]Posted: 10/16/05, Rated: 7[/i]

It's a cloudy, drizzly day today, so I thought I would introduce my family to another recent acquisition.  The sunny colors of the game board along with the five flavors of candy pastel camels provided a great contrast to the dreary skies outside.

Three games are behind us now, played with four people, then three, then two.  [i]Through the Desert[/i] is a fun little game.  The most lucrative scoring mechanism is to enclose a portion of the board with your own camels, that are also of the same color.  This mechanism feels a bit like [i][GAMEID=188].[/i]  There are ancillary scoring opportunities such as capturing "water holes," linking to oases, and having the longest caravan of a particular color.  In a tightly-contested game, these other scoring options can make or break you.

Initial placement of your "caravan leaders" is absolutely vital to winning  the game.  I cannot emphasize this point enough.  It also means that a player with poor leader placement is probably doomed from the outset, even if she doesn't know it yet.  This dynamic is so severe that it limits the fun people have while playing if they realize their own predicament.

[i]Through the Desert[/i] is a lot of fun, and the family is already asking for more.  It definitely earns a solid score of "7."  Maybe its score will creep up when we all become more proficient at it.

RATING: 9
Easy to learn and quick to play, yet strategic and confrontational, with lots of tension and turn angst.  This game is reduced down to its most basic elements, but this is precisely why it is so wonderful. The fact that a turn consisting only of 'Place two camels on the board' can be so difficult is absolutely wonderful. The only real fault I can find with it is that at times it seems too predictable -- you play there, so I have to play here, etc., but then again it's also a part of the game's appeal: players can actually make threats and force opponents to respond (unlike some other Eurogames where it feels like one player's choice doesn't truly impact the next player's decisonmaking process). The multiple sources of victory points provide strategic interest and depth in a game that would otherwise be too cut and dry. The game does lack the ability to make truly 'surprising' and profound moves (as in Chess, [perhaps to a lesser extent] Tigris & Euphrates, wargames, etc.), but on the other hand, the fact that Through the Desert is so straightforward while providing such a rich strategic experience is a large part of the reason it is such a great game. Through the Desert is a great 'gateway' game (due to the simple turn structure and transparent scoring mechanisms) that has enough depth to be played for years. It is not praised nearly as often as it should be. (2009-03-21; revised 2014-02)

[url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/11/11919.phtml]This review[/url] provides some very insightful comments as well: [i]TtD's biggest strength is that it's a game of brinkmanship. Every turn is agonizing because there are multiple actions that you want to take, and you have to constantly worry about other players taking the same opportunities that you're hoping to take advantage of. ... [Due to the multiple sources of points, there is not a single] good answer for winning every game. There are also lots of tradeoffs, as you give up one victory option to pursue another. ... The 8 oasis spaces and (to a lesser extent) the variable water holes can really change the game around a lot.[/i]

GoLike, MultiOnly

I used to have two copies, and now only own the more compact and recent FFG reprint.

One of the games that strikes my brain the right way.  For me, it's "Go Lite", whatever other Go fans might say.  ;)  The characteristics of the game itself may be different, but the same areas of the brain are stimulated (as some other user on the 'Geek had to say).
  
I keep this game around to scratch the "Go itch" with friends who are less interested in Go.  Or for multiplayer "Go".  And the pastel camels are a definite factor.  ;)

I got rid of this, because there were elements where a person who had played just 2-3 games of this, would be performing so much better than a person new to the game...it would be an absolute bloodbath.  The mechanic of not having the same colored camels touch each other, and all the different ways of scoring...it just...  didn’t make me feel good about introducing it to people.  "Oh, sorry, didn't you remember that small deserts were worth 2 and large worth 3...and then claiming the most camels was worth 10.  Oh, and they can't touch if they're the same color.  Sorry you forgot about that during set-up."  

It's ok to teach a game, but you have to be able to correct people AS they're making the mistake, and I hate correcting them like 7 moves down the line when they thought they could do something and couldn't...and this game fosters that situation.

Fantastic on the tablets though.

So, playing it: 8
If I have to explain the rules: 5

-----------------

I thought about this a bit.  Way too much points-soup.  Which, on its own as a game mechanic it isn't bad...  but pretending you can keep all the different dimensions of scoring together in your head as you judge your opponents intentions, motivations, and scoring...HA!

While I know that's the point, to be surprised by something you weren't thinking about and to catch your opponent by something they weren't thinking about...  you really can't pretend to think you know what's going on in the game even when you do fully understand and grok all the different ways to score points.

So I don't really like that in a game unless I'm always playing with people that know it.

Used to like this a lot but has gone a bit stale. Probably because the game is just very dry and themeless. Basically just a multiplayer abstract. Still ok to play once in a while. Simple rules but hard to master. And stop fussing about the color of the camels!

After not playing it for 7 years. It just had to go, even if it's a classic.

Seemed like a good game with a balance of opportunism and defense, but I only got to play it twice with my wife.  And she flipped the board midgame.  Twice.

Only played it 2-player. From the reviews, I expected it to be better, but I think I'll like it better with more players.

I never ended up choosing this one over my others, so I traded it for T&E. I've decided that I don't like games in which you're trying to cordon off an area of the board. Too tactical and--well, I don't know. I just don't like it.

The one game I would be most reluctant to lose out of my current collection. Like Knizia's best work, and like many of the best games out there, it's a game where there are just so many things you need to do and not enough time to do them. A good game of TtD will have bluffing, misdirection, careful blocking and maneuvering, some amount of table talk ("No, he's the threat!"), and a great time had by all. And I've never had a bad game of TtD.

Simple.  Tense.  Limited actions.  30 minutes.  Camels.  Great game.

*Update*  Not quite as much strategy as initially conceived.  After caravan leader placement you basically know all your moves in advance, its just a matter of prioritizing.  Also, the game appears determined more by whose plans are interfered with less and who can take advantage of a failure to block.

This is one of the game that I seldom played.  To be honest, I don't think I have even played the set I bought.  I would consider this to be an abstract game but presented in acceptable setting.  Though the game has no story to immerse myself with, I think the game is nicely designed with the idea of making caravan routes and finding oasis to score more points.  Perhaps, this can be considered a lighter version of Go/Weiqi.

I think this is a good game to be introduced to children as they would most likely like cute plastic camels presented in different pastel colors.  I plan to play this with my wife but she seems to be busy with her work or is mentally preoccupied with other matters.

RATING: 7
A typical 5C game; Chaining candy colored camel caravans. On a hex board.

In your turn you take two camels of one of the five colors and add them to one of your five caravans on the board. Equal colors of others' caravans can't touch and you gain points by collecting oase tiles, reaching palm trees, enclosing areas and having the longest caravan in each color.

Simple rules, but enough to ponder. Since the board is pretty tight there's multiple fronts where you're being contested by other players. Each turn it's constantly prioritizing the best tactical move. There is strategy in guessing your opponents plans and outmaneuvering them.

It's a fun filler that stays challenging enough over time. You can, however, be seriously handicapped by opponents at the beginning of the game when claiming starting positions. It's hard to overcome a crowded starting place. Also, it's not that friendly for the color-impaired among us. In lamp light I'm struggling a bit to distinguish some of the pastel pieces.

A nice easy game that takes 10 minutes to learn and 20 minutes to play.  I think it could appeal to younger kids although I haven't tried it out yet with them.  Although it is easy there is enough depth where one could continue to improve over a dozen or so games.

Very abstract game where you're trying to connect to points and enclose areas.  Its a quiet kind of thinking game.  There's a significant amount of interaction trying to compete for territory and block people off.  One big problem is that I think all the different colors can get a little busy and cluttered and my version of the board it's a little hard to see where the edges of the mountains are.  So while I think it is a pretty solid abstract, the inability to see at a glance what is going on on the board hurts it a lot for me.

We enjoy developing our caravans in this area control game. There are only two actions to perform, so the playing field is evened for all. Pastels keep tempers down nicely when you are cut off by your opponent. One must pay attention to all five caravan developments, being mindful of the various scoring mechanisms! Enclosing areas is vital to scoring, but mostly in the 3 or 4 player games. This should be made clear to new players and those who do not excel in abstract games.

9/11/05 - ohh the choices - Knizia says he likes to give gamers many choices but restricts them to pick only a few. This presents a problem for me because I find it hard to decide what to do when I have many choices before me. Do I go for the oasis, extend my green camel caravan to stay ahead for largest caravan, try to encircle that beautiful sandy area for endgame points or try to water my camels??? Arrggghhhh! Fun stuff.

RATING: 9
Another classic Knizia game whose only failing is that it is thematically fairly dry, virtually abstract. Still, tons of choices and trade-offs; very incremental (each play is small, but they add up to a lot). And while the theme isn't strong, it's rather graphically appealing. It's not a regular around here anymore, but it's a tremendous and very underrated gateway game, in addition to being a great game for hobbyists.

4/12/08: First experience gaming at Bear Rock Cafe.  Randy finished the game early to prevent it from spinning out of control, and this resulted in me winning by a mere one pt.

RATING: 8
What a killer. I don't get this game. In fact, I quite suck at it.  Nonetheless, I see the genius of it and love to play.  I just wish I knew how.

Seems you can't get done what you need to.  You must retrieve as many points as possible, but the crowded board prevents you from realizing all of your plans.  The end-game mechanic is very elegant and simple and cunning enough to make me grind my teeth in frustration.  Awesome game.  I won't mention the best pieces in gaming history.  Oh - too late.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This one isn't really my style, as it's almost a pure abstract of placing camels to section off areas of the board and claim hexes of the map first. I prefer a little more randomness in my games, as everything here is perfect information.

There is some decent tension here, as you hope others don't make placements that interfere with your plans, and the game is well-designed. It's just not a style of game that I love.

The tension in this game is that you always want to do more than you can. You get two placements, but there are always five or six places that you need to go to right now or you'll be blocked out of points.

20 - Plays like a variant of go, and similar to samurai.  I enjoy the make of pieces, which add a lot of color to a very well-made board game.  Setup can be an unnecessary pain because everything is all in one bag.  If the pieces were better separated, you could save a lot of time.  The game is best played with equally skilled/experienced players because it can turn out to be a very one-sided game pretty quickly if you got off to a bad start. 

5-13-07 After several more plays, I enjoy this game more and more.  Its a perfect middle weight game that is around 45 minutes and gives a good amount of strategy with luck.  The slight problem I have with the game is that with 3 players, there is a tendency for teaming up and kingmaking.  When that occurs, it becomes very difficult for that certain player to have a chance.   However, this applies to man 3 player games.

RATING: 8
Yet a great game from Knizia. Sure, it's abstract, but I'm not a sucker for themes at all, and I adapt to all of the pasted on themes, so I feel like I'm making caravans in the desert...

I really like the open-information board - every player has access to the same information, so there is no luck and the winner is probably the player who played best, and I like those games. The only thing you do on your turn is placing 2 camels, so the gameplay itself is extremely easy, but it's actually much harder than it sounds as there are lots of places you want to put them, so you need to think where they will benefit you the most. So, the fact that you want to do more thing on your turn than you are allowed to, along with the various ways you can score points, makes this game a game I like quite a lot!

It's also one of the few games my wife actually requests to play, so that's a huge bonus! Knizia really is the master of board game designs, and he has designed a lot of my favorite games (not those in my personal top 3, but definitely a couple in my top 20 and one in my top 5 (Ra)).

Played as 2-player and it worked nicely. The game plays a lot faster than I expected. Even while learning the game, I think it only lasted 15-20 minutes and felt more like 10. I had to double-check the rules to make sure we played right.. yep, we did. 3-players felt better.. 4 felt a bit crowded, but I think there is a whole new game at that level.

I think a lot of people tend to ignore this one because of the pastel colors.. but the game will really suck you in past the colors and into the excellent gameplay. Already a favorite.. didn't feel too short, like Lost Cities did to us.. but did go quickly. Looking forward to trying with more players.

Camels and palm trees. Awesome game pieces. Only played this one once but can't wait for the rematch. This game is not just for breakfast anymore. (Update: 2nd game and my camels got stuck in a sandstorm, oh well still learning this one)

Excellent game of tile placement, very strategic and attractive from vision.  The camels markers are remarkable!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rated "8" after one play with three players. Wow. Surprisingly cutthroat. But it plays much lighter than what is essentially a no-luck game. Each turn, all you do is place two camels. But the agonizing choice is that you've got 6 things you want to do... and only two camels.

I expect the two player game is a bit more forgiving, and this has potential to be a solid "spouse game."

Update: Finally played this with two players. It's strange to have one caravan color of your own that your opponent does not. The board is more forgiving with two, and it seems more about enclosing large areas. I think my favorite player count is three players. If my wife could get past the pastel colors, we'd be playing this with more regularity. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good, solid game that's thought-provoking but not extremely long or complicated.  I've heard that it scales quite well for the entire range of 2-5 players, but I've only played with 2, 3, or 5.  (I much prefer 3 to 2, and I'm indifferent between 3 and 5.)  The pastel-colored camels are some of the cutest game pieces I've seen.

I enjoy the complete and open information that leads to analysis and the variety of ways to score lead to different strategies each time as the game develops.  After 10 or so plays I have finally overcome my initial fear that I am going to play a dry analytical game.  This fear has not played out once in any of the games I have played.  I think one just needs to get over that hump and begin to see the variety of ways you can approach the game.

RATING: 9
This is an easy euro that can be grapsed by anyone. Yet it is deep and engrossing and always addictive. In my opinion it is the next step after Settlers and it combines simple play with agonising priority decisions. What do you do now and what do you leave for later? There is constant pressure to sort your priorities and confront the challenges that others pose. Excellent, a must own game that can be played in 45 - 60 minutes.

This is a really neat game.  I usually prefer games that have an element of luck, but I love this one.  You can't feel intimidated by a game when there are pink camels involved.

RATING: 8.5
Quite possibly best with three and weakest with five.  Two player only seems to work well when both players are clearly balanced in skill.  Delightfully tense and deep in attempting to deduce and predict what trade-offs the other players will make.  Understanding the incentive mesh can be surprisingly difficult.  

The metagame of manipulating suggestive opportunism is particularly delicious.  In fact the larger the player count the more the game seems to involve creating "you and him fight while I win" situations.  The problem is that with larger player counts the control of those incentive fights is so ambiguous as to be almost moot.

Excellent game that appeals to my love of Go.  Really does solve the 5,000 year puzzle of multi-player Go.  Similar strategies apply: don't start your pieces on the areas, think about perimeters, and think about attack and defense.  However, it's possible to score big with oasis and camel train points, which of course is something quite apart from Go.  Thinking single-mindedly about area control is always a bad idea.

Overall, I like this game (but to be honest I thought I would like to more than I do).  However, I enjoy the tension offered by only being able to place two camels per turn.

Interesting blend of route building and area enclosure.  Most of my games are two player, and the game also gives the feel of a racing game, as players try to end around to keep a caravan from enclosing an oasis.

Quick, simple rules, tough decisions. I love the camels. 

My rating keeps going up the more I play it.  Also, I've introduced this to several different groups of players...and its been universally liked and requested.  I hadn't expected that.  Its been well worth the above-average cost to obtain the German version. Deserving of its reputation.

RATING: 6
I've enjoyed this game when I played it, but, overall, my feelings are best described as "tepid".  I've come to conclude that it's just too abstract for me, but perhaps I'm grasping for justifications.  "OK but blah" sums it up for me.

RATING: 5
A light-medium weight tile (camel) laying game suitable for both the hardcore and casual. Scoring in this game comes fast and furious, and initial placements seem to be very, very important in dictating what and where the important battles are going to be. Only difficult thing to keep track of in this title is the gamut of scoring opportunities, I would almost say too many in that one can inadvertantly score points for having long chains, racking up the oasi bonuses, and picking up watering holes along the way with the enclosure mechanism being very potentially powerful but generally hard to enact against wary foes. 

I like the title, but I think much of it has to do with the presentation and speed relative to its ancestor. Without pastel camels and plastic oasis trees this game would likely lose major appeal points for me, as it stands, willing to play most of the time, but mainly because it's fast and I have no real urge to own it, and would certainly never request it. Was dying to get back to it after my first two plays, cooler after the third, after the fourth I was still willing to play it, but wouldn't be suggesting it, after the fifth I am starting to wonder if I have much of a response to this at all anymore. The experience of playing this is far from unenjoyable, it is just a little too basic for my tastes, and though I do like the control vis a vis Samurai's random tile draw I still don't find myself enthused about this in any way beyond the presentation.

The most engaging, entertaining abstract ever made.  I really quite like this.  Particularly fun with 2, but also quite good with more.  Of course, avoid playing with analysis paralysis victims.  And don't eat the camels.

I'm a fan of Reiner's "purer" games, and this is one of those.  Play camels, try to surround areas and make connections.  The fact that you are playing in five colors simultaneously is a neat wrinkle that makes the game what it is.

Looking forward to more. *UPDATE* okay, second play and same poor result.  Hm.  No doubt it is me just not being able to anticipate what the board is going to look like spacially until it is too late for me to do anything about ... none-the-less it's the kind of game I can enjoy even when it kicks my ass.

WOW!!!  
Why did I wait so long to play this?  Probably because my daughter didn't like the sound of it.  After play #1, she loves the camels and rates it an 8 and so do I.

A classic.  A great 3 player abstract game that doesn't feel like other abstracts, because of the theme, which works and makes sense.   In a way, this reminds me of Biblios, but with route building instead of auctions.

RATING: 8
I cannot remember why I decided to buy this game: I think it was because of the pictures here on the Geek. I bought this game without trying it first, and have not regretted it one bit. Just place two camels each round, and work your way from there: do you go for territories? Long caravans? Oasis control? Your choice. With two players this game is excruciatingly tense and quick. With four players it is different, and slightly slower, but still highly enjoyable. At the start the board is so cluttered that one quickly decides to ignore one or even two of their caravans and concentrate on the remaining ones instead, which is shame, sort-of. The game clearly belongs in Knizia's top 3, though not at first place because of the clunkiness of the set-up and odd (but understandable) asymmetry when actually commencing play. Nevertheless, once the first camels are on the board, the game refuses to let you go, drawing you deeper and deeper into its heart devoid of unnecessary frills. This is an abstract game in a delightful setting with an extremely high what I'd call in Dutch 'aaibaarheidsfactor'&mdash;'pettability factor'&mdash;which always meets with approval whenever it hits the table.

Upon (many!) repeated plays, I found that this game wears well with age, and after giving Go a go, I've come to appreciate it even more. It isn't exactly Go, of course, but there are elements which remind me of it. The fact that you encircle other caravans, for example, while trying to deny them space so they can't create territory, for example. The fact that making a move here automatically weakens you there. There are differences too: Go doesn't know about important spots on the board as does Through the Desert, so the game play focuses on other elements too besides making territory: making long caravans, and connecting them to oases and water holes. It's interesting to speculate on these aspects.

Spatial games aren't always my thing, but for some reason this one just connected with the right parts of my brain and it was love at first sight.

Players spread their groups of camels in various lovely pastel colors around the board, trying to pick up water tiles, connect to oases, or enclose an area with just one color.  Skillful positioning and blocking is key, and there is a lot to keep an eye on.

I loved that there were several ways to improve your score, so even as you got cut off in one area you knew there would be other opportunities.  This is a solid winner, and I'm only sorry it took me so long to play it!

The quick-and-easy points produce the situation from which the game emerges.

But since the quick-and-easy points are visible from the get-go, the game starts before the first camel is placed.

I don't feel like I'm very good at this game, but I enjoy it a lot, in an ARGH I WANT TEN ACTIONS NOT TWO kind of way. :) The only reason I haven't bought a copy yet is that I've heard negative things about board warping in more recent printings.

Components: Easy-to-handle camels, scoring tokens, and scoring tiles. The infamous colors are unusual, but playable.

Experience: I enjoy the four different ways to score, the simplicity of my turn, and the quick pacing of the game (its marriage of slow, always-have-a-turn's-warning pacing with not-enough-time-to-do-everything-I-want anxiety). The more I play it the more convinced I am of its brilliance.

Beginning with the initial placements, the game is immediately tense. Every move is a battle to solidify boundaries, to fork opponents and force tough choices, and to position myself for maximum flexibility. It's interesting to gauge the relative worth of a scoring opportunity, weighed against the effort to achieve it. And I must always keep a close watch on the camel supply.

A bit of randomness is inherent in this game, but the idea of pastel camels just appeals. The rules can be a bit of a bear to get through, but learning from someone else is the way to go. When the game is done, the board is a work of art to behold. The game has some tactical aspects to it and you have to manage the total number of camels available, while trying to sequester as many points as you can. The game is light and fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
What can I say. Abstract gaming in Euro form, scaling brilliantly from 2 to 5 players. Always more depth to this game. Does require equally skilled players, as someone could be effectively out of the game due to poor placement in the initial placement round.
Update: well not perfection, but still pretty darn good. Dropped rating from 10 to 9 to 8 as can be somewhat determined by initial placement by 2, and very unpredictable with more than 3. And frankly perfect information abstracts appear to be losing their interestfor me.
Further update, down to a 7.5. Definitely in a class of games that I am losing interest in. Game which don't have much laughter, that could be largely programmed by a computer for optimal play. (Once placement was done, I think I could program a decent algorithm for playing this game).

Very simple game with lots of cute bits and tough decisions (but not too tough) on every turn. Plays fast and doesn't have any "war-like" aspects, so works very well with kids and pacifistic spouses.

A very solid game, which I've played a number of times over the years.  This was the first German language game I bought (it was all downhill after the first).  Game play is simple and pretty straightforward, so it's easy to teach quickly.  Reiner's light homage to Go...

I love the way the tempo changes from the beginning to the middle and then in the end game.  Quite an excellent design.  No luck, perfect information, many possible strategies, no way to optimize them all = good tension.  

Very reasonable play time, if players know the game can get a 3 player done in 1/2 hour.  5 in less than an hour.  (not counting setup time)

Vous incarnez une des cinq tribus de bédouins qui développent leurs caravanes dans le désert. A vous d'occuper au mieux les lieux stratégiques les plus lucratifs.

But du jeu : avoir le plus de points en fin de partie

Préparation
A 4 ou 5 joueurs tout le plateau est utilisé, à 2 et 3 joueurs seule la grande partie est utilisée ( un trait foncé sépare le plateau). Le plateau est divisé en hexagones, et chaque hexagone ne peut contenir qu'une pièce, chameau ou palmier.
Dans ce jeu les joueurs ne sont pas identifiés par une couleur de chameau mais par la couleur de cavaliers. Au début de la partie les joueurs reçoivent 6 cavaliers de couleurs identiques plus un chameau gris et un chameau dans chacune des cinq couleurs. Le joueur placera un de ses cavaliers sur le chameau gris et le posera devant lui,celui ci servant simplement à identifier la couleur du joueur. Un cavalier ira sur chacun des chameaux de couleur. A 5 joueurs, chacun se défausse d’un chameau de couleur différente avec son cavalier.
Les autres chameaux sont triés par couleur et placés à côté du plateau pour former les 5 réserves communes .
A 2 joueurs, on retire 10 chameaux par couleur.
A 3 joueurs, on retire 5 chameaux par couleur.
Les cinq palmiers sont placés sur cinq des cases illustrées avec un palmier, il représentent les oasis. Les points d’eau sont mélangés et placés face visible sur chaque case marquée d’un cercle ainsi que sur les cases palmier inoccupées. Le matériel non utilisé est mis de coté.
Le jeu commence par une phase de position : chaque joueur pose l’un après l’autre un de ses chameau sur un hexagone libre, qui ne soit pas adjacent à un oasis ou à un autre cavalier et qui ne contient pas de point d’eau. Au premier tour les joueurs s’efforceront de jouer une couleur de chameau qui n’a pas encore été jouée.
Quand les 5 tours de positionnement ( 4 à 5 joueurs ) est terminé le jeu commence.

Le jeu
A son tour, le joueur choisit deux chameaux de la réserve ( identiques ou non) et les place sur des hexagones libres pour agrandir ses propres caravanes. Il faut placer un chameau de manière à ce qu’il touche un autre chameau de la même couleur et appartenant joueur. Il est donc possible d’agrandir sa caravane dans tous les sens et d’avoirs des embranchements secondaires.
Mais il est interdit de poser un chameau qui relierait deux caravanes de même couleur, et donc deux joueurs. Ainsi tout est clair et on sait exactement quel est le propriétaire de tel ou tel chameau.

Il y quatre façons de gagner des points :

1- Occuper les points d’eau : Le premier joueur à poser un chameau sur un point d’eau, récupère le jeton et gagne autant de points que sa valeur ( 1, 2 ou 3 ). Les jetons sont placés devant soi.

2- Relier les oasis : Lorsqu’une caravane arrive sur un des hexagones qui entourent une oasis, le joueur gagne un pion oasis qui vaut 5 points. Attention une caravane ne peut gagner de point qu’une seule fois par oasis, si d’autres chameaux sont posés par la suite autour de l’oasis il n’y aura pas de gain de points. Par contre le joueur pourra gagner des points en amenant une autre de ses caravanes à cette oasis ou encore cette même caravane pourra encore marquer des points en reliant une autre oasis.

3- Fermer un territoire : On entend par territoire une surface fermée par une et une seule caravane avec l’aide éventuel des bords du plateau de jeu et des surfaces montagneuses. En outre pour gagner des points il ne faut pas qu’il y ait de chameaux à l’intérieur du territoire. Si le territoire contient des points d’eau le joueur les récupère, si le territoire contient une oasis le joueur gagne le marqueur oasis correspondant et en plus à la fin de la partie, il marquera 1 point pour chaque hexagone vide.

4- Avoir les caravanes les plus longues:. A la fin de la partie, on regarde pour chaque couleur de chameau quel joueur a la caravane la plus importante, il suffit de compter les chameaux, il gagnera 10 points et en cas d’égalité le gain sera de 5 points pour tous.

Fin de la partie: Lorsque la réserve de chameaux d’une couleur est épuisée.

Mon opinion
Durch die Wuste est un autre jeu de pose de Reiner Knizia qui m’avait déjà comblé avec Samuraï et surtout la perle qu’est Euphrat und Tigris. Trois jeux de pose certes, mais aux mécanismes si différents que les trois méritent d’être achetés, aucun ne faisant double emploi avec un autre.
Dans Durch die Wuste la difficulté vient du nombre de façon de gagner des points, tout paraît accessible, à portée de main, mais il va pourtant falloir se concentrer sur les objectifs les plus profitables. Il faudra faire la part des choses entre le gain immédiat et les possibilités de développements futurs.
Beaucoup ont comparé ce jeu au go du fait qu’on y retrouve les notions d’expansion, de blocage, d’enferment et de coups quasi obligatoires en fin de partie. J’ai longtemps trouvé cette comparaison très exagérée jusqu’au moment où j'ai joué à 2 joueurs. Et je dois dire que dans cette configuration la filiation avec le go est plus évidente. En fait Durch die Wuste prend toute sa saveur lorsqu’il est joué à deux, avec davantage de joueurs cela reste très prenant mais il perd de sa pureté. Avec l’augmentation du nombre de joueur on passe d’un jeu abstrait et tendu, à un jeu de société familial rapide et agréable.
Tout le monde sait que les jeux aux règles les plus simples sont également les plus difficiles à maîtriser. On en a un illustration flagrante avec Durch die Wuste et le go. On prend le go et on multiplie les contraintes (poser à la suite d’un chameau de même couleur et du même joueur), les façons de gagner des points (occupation de cases de valeur différentes, territoires fermés, principe de collection pour les caravanes les plus longues) et finalement on obtient un jeu bien plus facile que le go ! En tout cas j’ai quant à moi toujours beaucoup de plaisir à jouer à Durch die Wuste et ce, dans toutes les configurations. Un futur classique.

Make camel trains that fence off territories (ala Go). Also try to have the longest camel trains of each color... and pickup some water and oasis points along the way.

Pretty good game.

[August 2017 - 8.9]
What an awesome little game that plays great at two players, all the way up to five. There's just a few ways to score points, which would seem easy, but the board quickly tightens up and gives you some good area-control decisions. There are many instances where you think you've come up with a strategy to easily win, but the game and your opponents check you. Really well balanced and games tend to run just 25 minutes.

As most have pointed out, the only con, is the pastel-colored camels... especially the green and blue are hard to tell apart in dim lighting.

After playing a few games of this on the IPhone and against my brother, I have to adjust my rating. This game is really fun, there are a lot of things to consider during your turn. One drawback: Since this game is quite abstract, I guess it is not for everyone. But I'm glad I gave this one another chance.

The game itself doesn't thrill me, though I can see why people like it.  The decisions are tough, which often equates to delicious (except you have to care, which I don't in this case).  But this game gets an extra ding for the horrible color scheme.  I love pastels, but being a little color blind makes differentiating them difficult, and the game is already hard enough.

I can see liking this one a lot with more plays.  But it feels like the camels shouldn't start on the board.  The game might be more interesting if you could place two matching camels, three different camels, or one new camel color as your turn.  The opening setup phase just seems to take away potential coolness.  I'll have to play it a bunch and see.

Interesting gameplay but a little bit chaotic.  I would likely rate it higher if it wasn't for the colour scheme being extremely unfriendly to colourblind players.  I'll try it once or twice more and if it seems worth it I will paint some of the pieces, otherwise I may sell or trade this away.

No real theories here yet, I went for closing off space the first game, and lost. ( in big part because we didn't know how to place initially, and I left 1/2 the board to the other 2 players)  The second game, I went for a mixture, of oasises, waterholes, and space, and squeaked out a win. Multiple games played since. in 1 on one I typically can hold my own / win.  multiplayer, I seem to get sqeezed out by more than 1 person at a time, and get chosen to be cut off almost before anyone else. sigh.

This is a game where at first I didn't like it, I bought it then traded it, then bought it again, then traded it again and subsequently bought it again. This time though it'll stay for good because I've finally warmed up to and discovered just what an amazing game it is. Every turn all you have to do is pick the colors of two camels and add them to an existing line...Yet what to pick and where to place them is stressful. The game state moves slow so you can see your opponent's plans and you want to mess with them. But by messing with them you might hurt yourself in the long run by neglecting your own pieces. There's internal conflict between growing caravans slow but evenly compared to one caravan fast. I have come to appreciate the simple nature of the rules but the complex decision make the game forces you to make. Simply brilliant.

I initially loved this game, but have become less enamored with it when you realize how much the initially placement can make or break the entire game.

As a 2-player, this is a fun game of punch-counterpunch. Just the right amount of strategy without slowing the game too much. A lot of hidden depth in the victory conditions. Adding more players really changes the dynamic of the game a lot, although it seems to play well with any number. I found the pastel camels garish at first, but somehow they really grew on me. :-) The only reason that I don't give it an 8 or 9 is that it is hard for me to get this one to the table for some reason. Maybe it's a bit too dry or analytical for my tastes... the fun factor of other Knizia games is higher. This is still a brilliant game, though.

Tartom e játékkal a standardom: szinte sosem nyerek vele : most se. Épp 2. helyre szorultam. Ugyanakkor ha nem is a kedvenc játékom, de levezetésnek jó. Egyszerű szabály, könnyen érthető, utána jól terelgethető, és persze gonoszkodós, másiknak keresztbetevős is.
Szóval vhol ideális családi játék: hisz szabály magyarázat max 5 perc,  játék sem hosszú, és izgalmas, mert a melyik ujjamba harapjak azért előáll: több helyen több lehetőség egyidőben, amiből jó párat az ellenfelek akadályozhatnak, de ugye csak 2 teve lerakás lehetőség: azaz nem lehetünk egyszerre mindenhol ott.

I need to play Through the Desert again to have a better idea of the game and how scoring works. I got confused in my first game. Plus, lots to do and so very few camels.

I played more games and it helped to have a better understanding on what to do and what was more important in the game. You want to do like a dozen things, but sometimes, you have to choose what to concerate on and what you can let go of. 

There are a lot of different colored camels in Through the Desert. Some colors are harder to see the differences when you are colored blind.

Hopefully, I won't have too much difficulties in future games. Some of the camels looks the same. I enjoy the mechanics of Through the Desert.

Game can finish sooner than expected if like 3 people concernate on the same color.

5 plays since recording games played.

RATING: 8
I've always enjoyed TtD.  It provides plenty of painful decisions to make each turn, there is plenty of tension between players as they race to grab points or cut one another off and the end game is always tense.

The setup is the only real hump in the game.  For such a simple and fast game the setup is just a twinge long.  I suppose the real issue is that I play this mostly with newbie gamers and so unless I've had a chance to review the setup I'm not too motivated to pull it out and stumble though all the components while newbies await their next gaming experience.  Nothing insurmountable, but it does get kept on the shelf because of this reason at times.

RATING: 8
After one play:  I love this game!  Despite the 10  age, my six-year-old did great (no reading of cards, etc to worry about also playtime under an hour).  The camels are pretty cool as everyone seems to agree.  The rules take a bit to wade through but should be easy enough to remember on subsequent plays.  This is one we are likely to play at least once or twice a week.  After a few more plays I dropped it from a 9 to an 8 mostly because the gameboard gets cluttered by the end of the game making it hard to see whose caravan is whose at least with three people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite simple, and the term "camel piles" just makes me crack up everytime I say it. It's fast and is easy to get into it, haven't played it more than two players yet but it's a bit dull after a few games, having a couple extra players would probably help out dramatically.

Great game that plays fast, is easy to teach / learn, but tough to master. The pastel camels look like candy, so be careful bringing this one out among young kids (or impulsive adults). Even though it is in Knizia's "tile laying trilogy", it doesn't really feel like a tile laying game at all. I enjoy the game a lot, but it ended up being a tad too light for our tastes.

I enjoy this one and the little pastel camels are awesome.  I feel like it's equally good regardless of the number of players involved.  There is definite strategy to this game which even includes initial setup.   I feel like initial setup of the game can really tell how good or bad you're going to do and then the game simply unfolds to the winner with the best setup.  If you placed poorly however, I could see this as a negative aspect to the game.

Those camels are so darn pretty.What I like most about the game is that there seems to be a relatively small point spread by the end of the game -- the first and last players (in my games, at least) are usually separated by about 20 points. This makes it very important who gets the longest camel conga-line bonus, which injects some extra competition into the game.

This is not the simple "chase each other around the board" game that you may think. Every decision is painful. If you play in one area, you know you are giving up something elsewhere. While the game is pretty, the colors detract from functionality, and the quality (FFG) is subpar.

This game will take one playing just to figure out, as initial placement is important, and you won't know where to place until you understand the whole game.  Very little luck, tough decision making, but this game (like Tigris & Euphrates) doesn't foster much 'table talk'... the players are generally too intent on studying the board.  Short and fun.

Top notch filler, given the short rules and challenging play.  Very quick to go from opening the box for the first time to having a reasonably well played first game with some tough decision making.

The mechanics lack variety, which I think prevents it from rising above filler to something more engaging.  Camel, camel, camel, camel, camel, camel, etc.  True, Go doesn't have much variety in its mechanics either, but it has an awesome scope which TtD can't match in 45 minutes.  

Keeps dropping in my estimation as I play more fillers.

This is one of those clever Knizia games of which I’m not a fan. It's a reasonably clever game for forcing your one move each turn to be offensive or defensive and with the different angles for scoring in mind, but I'm not the type who finds this type of exercise fun. Many, many other games I'd rather play as a thinky filler; Kingdom Builder for starters.

Through the Desert is an interesting version of a territory control game.  Players place camels on the board in caravans of like color in order to gain points through surrounding or touching oases and squares with points.

It's fun, but there's only one possible action during play (place camels), so I can see it getting dull over time unless you really enjoy abstract strategy games such as "Go."  Personally, I prefer game play with varied options, so this game won't be on my favorites list.

["Tile" placement, Spatial] {4P:8, 3P:8, 2P:8} {FFG Reprint May 2005. With plastic pastel camels. Without plastic palm trees. Good thing little plastic palm trees aren't that hard to find... CORRECTION: Chris Petersen says WITH little plastic palm trees, so we lose nothing! *dance of joy*} Reiner Knizia's "Game of Life" where there are so many things to do but only two camels a turn to do them with. Yeah, that sounds weird. If anyone ever asks me what the essence of German gaming is, I'd pull this game out to illustrate. Very simple mechanisms, no luck, very tough decisions, huge turn angst and concepts that are easy to grasp... all in a fun 30-minute game. There's always a lot of table talk going on, with players pointing out where each play should go to block off someone else other than themselves, or who's got the longest caravan, or who's in the lead. The presentation of the game, with its plastic camels and desert terrain, is no slouch either. No, the theme-to-mechanism ties aren't robust, but in a game this simple I don't think they could be regardless if it's desert oases or putting greens. This is pure game, and it's very, very good. There's not enough depth here to make it insanely great, but as gateway games go, Through the Desert is always one of the best places to start. Highly recommended.

Played two games with Charles (red beard), and both times I scored about 80-85 and he scored 150 the first time and 130 the second.  Fun game and wouldn't mind playing it again ... but with three players, not just two.  Strategy hints:  Set up caravan leaders roughly one per every 1/5 of the playing field and as close to oases as possible; game is more about area control than anything, so try to aim for that instead of point counters; and try to connect caravan routes to each oasis for 5 points each.

Knizia borrows a few elements from a number of classic designs and makes a very enjoyable area enclosure / network game. It's easy game to teach but deep enough to pull out for a mid-weight filler. Through the Desert has so many placement options, but the limit of two pieces a turn keeps things snappy and interesting. Love the look of the camels, though under low light it can be difficult to tell differences in colour. Overall, TtD works very well, is wonderfully straightforward in execution and yet it is quite a tense and confrontational game. At times, a bit mean! (But the 'good' kind of mean').

RATING: 7
Great fun to play. The playing pieces look like pastel candies. Some say the game has elements of the game GO. You score points by linking the same color of camels together (with your leader camels). You get points for touching Oasis and going into Watering Holes. You can also score big by closing off areas with your caravans. I'm sure I'll play this again some time. OK, what game shall I play next?

A quick paced brain burner, which at times has the potential to suffer from analysis paralysis.  Again, it's another Knizia where your actions are too few for all the moves you want to make.  Tough decisions, tense competition, all playable in under thirty minutes makes a great game.  Through the Desert also scales well, although the experiences are vastly different with changing numbers of players.

UPDATE: Will have to consider why, but this title is finding it difficult to really compel me to play.

Based on the few plays online. None won. :)

EDIT
The gameplay is great! Interesting. There ain't no turning points in the game, but you can do well in one part and play very badly in the other.
Quality of the cammels is trmendous. I was scared that they would be trashy, but they aren't.
Sometimes, in bad light, it's hard to manage what's going on on the board. I think that you just need to get used to it. (The same feeling while first played Wooly-Bully).
Want to play more. And with more players.

EDIT
Setup was horrible. Need really skilled opponent to have a nice play. Sold.

I want it back. :) Bought again. Very good with 3 too!

I find this game a little disappointing.  There just isn't any thrill for me.  I thought there would be more excitement in trying to block other caravans or finding ways to snake my caravans from oasis to oasis.  Not so. 

The more I play this, the more I like it.  With 5 players, it can be a fun light game playable in 30 minutes.  

One of the very first games I bought.  Now that I own so many other games, there are far more games that do similar things better!  Traded away.

Looking back at this game, I don't think I find enough strategy in it.  Sure, you're adding camels to your lines but it didn't feel like there was enough to process.

Acquired December 2005; first played January 2006. Hard to beat this game for 5 players. No luck involved. Pure strategy and tactics play. Tense game, if you are really into it -- always wanting to place more than 2 camels per turn. Must adjust your plans to accommodate other players' moves. Can be frustrating, but everyone has the same chance to win, so usually everyone has the same frustration. Generates some conversation during, and mostly after, the game. Must remember to keep all the scoring options in mind throughout the game.

One of those first euro games I brought in the 90s, I haven't played this one for awhile.  I didn't really enjoy it as much.

No real communications between players needed.

Extremely quick logic game. The camels look so cute but there is one flaw in the game (similar as in Euphratus and Tigris) - I couldn't grasp the rules of placing the camels based on colours. I was just mixing up the camels' colours with the ones of camel riders'.

Put off playing this for a long time thinking it was a drawn-out, chess-like affair. Far from it. With 2-player, at least, this is fast and vicious, caravans spreading across the board in full sprint. Since I'm never one to re-tabulate player points after every move, preferring instead to rely on intuition and gut, TtD gives me the spirit of Go without the commitment and ceremony. A brilliant design.

Glad that I finally got to play this game.  Yes, it is abstract.  No, camels are not really that color.  Well, I guess you could paint the camel.  Regardless, this game scales nicely, plays quickly, and makes for some nice decision making.  Having said that, the game is kinda ugly and for me a little bland.  The gameplay is nice, but it doesn't grab me like others. Then again, I miss owning this!

Looks cool, and again another Knizia game that's easy to grasp, but the depth of strategy is immense. A great game for 2 to 5 players, and surprisingly, it works well with any number of people. Very fun, and very quick.

A great deal of people are put off by the plastic pastel camels, and it's made this one a tough sell for nearly anyone. Perhaps if they were wood camels, it might be easier to get other folks into it.

This is an enjoyable game of using camel trains to capture territory and earn points from oases scattered about the map. In a game of more than 3 players, the map can get a bit crowded, which adds to the challenge of trying to capture and secure points. Initial rider placement is rather important to long-term strategies. You have to take your time early in the game to place riders strategically for capturing areas.

Picked this up on my Wife's recommendation based on someone mentioning to her it was sililar to Hacienda (which she loves).  It's a rather good game, very very simple to learn with a ton of strategy, which is always a good thing.  It does have a passing similarity to Hacienda but not much (trying to hit oasis is similar to trying to hit all markets), I prefer Hacienda though.

Παιχνίδι αφαιρετικής σκέψης area control του Δρ. Κνίτσια για όλη την οικογένεια. Το θέμα του παιχνιδιού έχει να κάνει με καραβάνια στην έρημο αλλά θα μπορούσε βέβαια να είναι οτιδήποτε. Εύκολο(το μόνο που κάνεις είναι να τοποθετείς δύο καμήλες σε κάθε γύρο),γρήγορο και αρκετά επιθετικό ότι πρέπει για να περάσεις συναρπαστικά και με πολλές συγκρούσεις την ώρα σου.

RATING: 9
I strongly prefer games with at least a dollop of luck or randomness thrown in somewhere rather than luck-free games of pure strategy.  I enjoy having to adjust to unpredictable game situations, and usually some random element is necessary to give me this feeling.  Durch die Wüste gives me this feeling without containing any random elements beyond setting up the board and choosing a start player.  The choices the game presents are so open and balanced that it's difficult to predict what my opponents will do in many cases.  That player-created chaos provides the tension and uncertainty I love with no need for true randomness.

Reiner Knizia has expertly tweaked the rules so that the game is perfectly balanced with 2, 3, 4, or 5 players (although I personally would recommend 2-4 only).  I wish more designers would follow his lead.

Why do pastel camels make a game so much better? I am not a fan of abstract games, but I do enjoy this one. Scratches a need for pure analysis, but with components that are simply fun to use. Also, everyone, even non-gamers, are interested in playing this game...and so far they have liked it. Unfortunately, my girlfriend is not numbered among them.

Just not enough plays though. I love my painted palm trees, but that is not enough to hold onto a game.

3 player only (for me).

Alterations: Open information 'Water holes'; Open scores (and well organized for easy reading); No tie-breaker, if there is one.

Touchstones: Manipulation of ambiguity

---

This game gains importance with me. The ticking clock on all of the scoring opportunities reshapes how the board might develop as I watch. Also, one's thoughts seem more exposed when these chains each have potential from opposite ends; none of the safety of having your back against the wall. 

Initial placements above and below the trees/oasis destabilized the area to a much greater degree than just off to the sides. If below, one can expect the 5 points, a waterhole or two, a few hexes, and a spoiler to clip any land grabs from either side. If above, one could capture the tree and a few hexes and build towards the 'island' with a chance at longest caravan. In either case it rushes any decision by opponents leaving one free to work elsewhere.

Another fairly abstract game that I didn't expect to enjoy all that much but surprised me by being quick, fun and challenging. Gives each player agonising decisions over where to place each turn so there's a danger of people getting bogged down with AP but if that doesn't happen then it's definitely a winner.

RATING: 2
I simply don't see makes this game so great.  I love Reiner Knizia's other tile games, (T&E and Samuria) but this one I just don't get.  First I hate all the colors.  The game is just painful to look at.  It's hard to tell who the cammels belong to.(Should have used different shapes.)  So much of the game depends on the starting placement of the riders.  If even one player does not know what they are doing they can easily give another player a chance to enclose a large part of the board.  With so many ways to score, this is not a good game for anyone but hardcore gamers.   The players must constantly keep track of the score of other players so they can try to stop them from scoring.  However using a cammel to stop someone from scoring usually meens sacrificing points of your own or allowing yet another player to score.

This game reminds me of the old "Jezball" game on Windows 95/98, and it plays similar to that of "Hey That's My Fish".  With each player trying to hedge out for themselves their own little piece of the desert, you find other people constantly getting in your way and you constantly getting in the way of everyone else.  For those who appreciate a heavy dose of player interaction and a love of pastel colours, this game is a simple but fun time.

Very straightforward rules; easy to pick up. Like most games by this designer, the initial simplicity of the rules  quickly leads to the realisation that far more complication lies within.

Have only played a few times and with 5 players. Found it very intense and chaotic. Will try to play with fewer people. I have the definite feeling that my score will increase with familiarity.

[UPDATE] After playing several games with 4 players, I still haven't warmed to the game. I find myself spending more time deciphering the board than playing the game.

[UPDATE] Played with 2 players and the game has grown on me. I'm beginning to ascribe my earlier dislike to an inability to follow the game properly. This game requires you to juggle many balls at once. I think this rating will improve. Also, blazing fast!

Those who prefer a little less randomness and a little less variability in setup may find the opposite to be true. Regardless, both are solid games and different enough to warrant owning both.

Excellent game with moderate to difficult decisions to make and no luck involved. Fun with newcomers too. I have no problem with the theme and the components are great. I have the Kosmos version Durch die Wüste that I bought after playing the out of print Fantasy Flight version and even though most of the components are almost identical the watering hole chips are shaped like ponds with 3 different shapes and the Fantasy Flight ones are circles. While the Kosmos ones are nice, if you keep your score to yourself by turning your pieces upside down it is kind of easy for others to tabulate those totals if you organize your pieces by point. Of course the 5 and 10 point pieces are indistinguishable so that could negate the issue. Really a great game though.

Those innocuous-looking pastel camels conceal a surprisingly competitive game.  You're constantly torn between responding to your opponents' moves or initiating an aggressive counter elsewhere on the board.  With several ways to score, there is no obvious dominant strategy, and the game works well with several different player counts. Truly fun!

Great game because it takes little time to learn and many plays to master.  Fun and fast.  I feel as though it plays very different with 2-3 players and 4-5 players, which requires strategies to change.  Still learning the best place for caravan leaders, but will hopefully develop good fundamentals after repeated plays.  I like a little more theme in my games, so I dinged TtD a little because of that.

This game might not appeal to all tastes, but don't be put off by its pastel components.

It's fun and light, but it has an annoying amount of setup to complete for such a light game.  This is the number one reason it's not often requested come game time.

Another area control game, but with camels. Decent game, but it lacks in excitement for me, compared to other games I own. I find it predictably boring tthese days.

RATING: 3
This is an abstract game in theme game's clothing.  I am generally a fan of abstracts, but this game left me cold for some reason.  Perhaps it was the length, or difficulty of getting ahead when I was the less experienced player.  

I would rather play a game like Pente, or Cathedral over "Through the Desert".  Blokus or Rumis are also preffered over this.  Maybe I just don't like camels....

Played this at last. The production quality wasn't as good as I had expected, the board warped and the trees occasionally popped apart. The game itself was interesting enough, very interactive and occasionally aggressive. The color scheme and the setup make it hard to keep an overview. Would play again, but my wife would probably not be very interested. Might have to let it go.

A terrific game.  Easy to learn, very suitable for kids, and the camels are fun to play with.  Five player games get crazy fast.

RATING: 7
A Knizia design that reminds me of Africa. Players race around trying to collect VP by running their camel caravans through oases and touching palm trees.

With 5 players it is chaotic, as each player has 5x caravans. Each turn a player can play up to two camels, and that's it. They can be both placed in the same caravan or split between two. Since only one camel can be placed in each hex, this is a race to grab as many VP before you're cut off, and the feel is similar to Samarkand. The only restriction is that each caravan is of a certain color, so camels cannot be placed that would merge two caravans of the same color.

Additional VP are awarded for encircling empty hexes with camels from a number of caravans belonging to a single player, in a manner like Go. Finally, bonus VP are awarded from getting the most camels out for each color of caravan.

It's fast and furious. However, it is clearly an abstract with the theme pasted on. So, it plays more like multi-player Go than anything else. Tempo is key, but with 5 players, that will get chaotic, so there are lots of things to keep track of. It's a nice filler, but not more than that. Once an evening is enough for me.

Another Knizia we like a lot. At first all the pastel camels and riders seem utterly silly and make you nauseous, but as you play, it starts to grow on you and you end having this strange appreciation (if not love) for this acid-induced-pastel-desert-party. #edit 07.07.2007: 5 player game too chaotic for my taste. This game will scale better from 2-4.

Surprizingly quick. I suspect this may turn in to an analysis paralysis nightmare once the game is better known in our group. Plus 'point counting' or at least guaging will probably be rife unless a time limit is applied.

Nice little game.  Fast playing, very little downtime.  Easy to learn but the game can be a little daunting once you get all of those pastel colored camels on the board.  I would think a bonus for overall longest caravan would be a nice addition and add a little more depth.  Solid game and extremely fun to play.

P.S. The consensus among our group was the pink camel looked like it would taste the best!

You're trying to surround areas on the map, collect tokens, and touch palm trees for points. There is an element where two players' camels of the same color cannot ever touch (otherwise you can't tell whose camel is whose), which can make placement tense when a same color is near where you've been playing or want to go.

RATING: 8
A fairly light tile-layer that gains a lot from being implemented as plastic miniatures rather than flat tiles. Plays best with 2-3 players, at higher numbers there are too many scoring opportunities to keep track of (as is fairly common for this designer) and chaos takes over. The use of pastel shades is an interesting choice, they increase the game's appeal among those who wouldn't normally bother with games, but are somehow less distinctive than primaries.

Incredibly simple rules, very quick, highly confrontational and very abstract.  There's definitely a level of strategy I have yet to grasp, and a certain amount of variability due to the initial (random) placement of point tiles and palm trees.  Lots of things to think about at once, in a way that I really enjoyed.  Color choices are poor.  Theme is irrelevant. (1 play)

Another classic.  My wife's favorite game mainly due to very pleasing pieces and a easy play mechanic.  The player is constantly trying to win caravan length fights and impeding his/her opponents at the same time.  Player must keep a constant vigil on the races each player is involved in and the progress they are making relative to them.  Even though the player has much to think about, game seems to flow quite smoothly as much of the analysis can be done on other people's turns.

Abstract strategy, many choices but never enough actions to take all that you want.  A game of sacrificing areas in order to control other areas worth more points to you, or just the fact that you stop the other players from collecting oasis'.  On a side note. . . lots and lots of plastic camels, that alone is worth the buy!! :)

First played this on Dec 29th 2006.  I was pleasently surprised how fun this game is.  I remember looking at pictures of this game and moving on through the list.  There is more strategy that meets the eye on this one, so for those who want a fair share of luck in a game, this isn't it.  It's quite clear that there are two phases to the game and doing the best of both seems to be the best strategy.

Through the Desert reminds me of the finer parts of Fjords or the whole of Go.  It's basically area control by line building with special scoring features.  I think the game is optimal with two or three and no more.  Man, does it get aggravating deciding how to place those two camels on your turn.  Aggravating in a good way, of course...

After a couple plays it is really growing on me.  Underneath it's thin theme is a pretty dry abstract.  But, it does give you interesting decisions, and it has very pretty bits.

The amazing thing to me is how fast the game plays.  It's true you have many possibilities on your turn, but only a few of them are worth considering.  I think I'm going to own this eventually.

Jan 08:  Man, I really like T&E and TtD, but Samurai just doesn't do it for me.  Knizia was 2 for 3 with tile laying games for me.  At the moment, I'll even give the nod to TtD over T&E.

Apr 08: Still like it.  Little brother was even asking about it the other day.

Simple game of camel placement!  Place your camels in such a way as to connect your caravans to oases and other point scoring locations, you can also cordon off areas of the map with them to score good points.

NOT recommended for colour blind people (or those with poor eyesight), the colour scheme is horrible and the camels are difficult to distinguish.

Didn't seem to have much replay potential for me, also the map was very boring.  It also seemed that the winner would almost always be obvious well before the game end, but I could be wrong.

I really like this area control game.  It moves quick becuase your only action is to add 2 camels.  I also think it gets better with more players.

Durch Die Wuste version (thank you Marketplace seller!).  Love the colors and camels. At first the game seems too simple , and the mechanics of it are, but you have to make the hard choices of where to put your 2 camels and the board changes each turn.Quick and fun.

The idea behind the game is interesting. Each player has a group of camels and you have to carefully construct camel chains to reach waterholes and oasises. 

The game can get pretty busy with lots of players and your routes will get cut off quick. You have to watch and make sure you can get where you need to get.

It's a fun game with cute, colorful camel pieces. That's one of the fun thigns for me about the game.

We usually play with the waterholes turned upside down to hide their value and add a little luck to the game.

Another fine Knizia game - simple rules, difficult choices, and several ways to score points. The only aspect of the game I don't like is the mechanism for determining the end ie running out of one colour of camels. Sometimes the game seems to end too soon or too suddenly.

A game that looks this rules-light should not be this engaging! I'm not generally a huge fan of Knizia's games, due to their average amount of luck, but in this one he put his elegant design skills to work. This one really rewards skillful play.

I continue to be impressed by how easily I can get this to a table of strangers. It's tough to pull off a win with 5 players, but you can still hone your skills for the more strategic 3-player game.

Create the longest chains of camels in the desert in an attempt to block your opponents and encompass the largest desert regions. Like in many of Knizia's games you are rewarded for higher ranks in each colour. An interesting strategy game that is really a stealth abstract. It works well with 3-5 players.

Knizia in a good form.  It's all about prioritization.  There are plenty of things you wanna do and only 2 actions in your turn :)  There's a lot of TENSION when you play this.

Dynamic, smart game with proper amount of decisions packed in a short playing time.

(On the downside: the game end can really be frustrating - that's why you could try a house rule of allowing the completion of actions by all players up to the starting player (thus each player gets the same no. of turns).  I know the sudden end is a part of the game and is what you have to carefully watch out for and have to definitely be prepared for, BUT anyway it sometimes creates too much of randomness and contributes to kingmaking.  The more players the more painful the problem.  5-player game is probably too much out of control anyway...)

EDIT:  Not a bad game at all, but not really that exciting now when I got to know sooo many games since I played TtD for the first time...  And I've got no time (and storage space) for just decent games when I struggle with time (and storage space) for great/brilliant ones...

RATING: 8
A great accessible & scalable mid-weight elegant easy to teach gateway abstract game that has a brisk pace and short game length making it perfect for weeknights when brain power and time are limited. 

Now not to say there is no depth as 4 different ways to score points ensures you have lots of things to keep track of on the board, the enclosure tactic is by far the most lucrative if you can pull it off without getting blocked. Amazing that you are only putting 2 camels on the board on your turn(similarity to GO, play one piece) but yet lots to think about and analyse and with no real AP either so it plays wonderfully fast. You could almost call this a filler except there is much more depth than games in that genre.

Will be buying this for all reasons stated above and to have another 'no luck game'. Will update after more plays with all player numbers...

[u]UPDATE[/u]: upped the rating to a solid 8 for this game right there with Samurai. They are close to the same weight, funny this one had a little more than I expected(probably the camels mislead me)and Samurai had a little less, regardless both "must own" games in IMO. This game really shines with 2 as there are more opportunities to be had and to be lost, it also feels a little more "Go" like and is more vicious as screwage is absolutely crucial to winning. 

Still excellent at any number as I have played 2 right to 5 now and despite what some people say 5 was great once one caravan leader was removed from each player as suggested in the rules. Enclosures are a little harder to do at higher numbers so racing to the water and the Oasis's becomes a little more important. My only knock is the set-up is a little long compared to the game length, this just means you should play 2 or 3 games since it is so good and so fast.

Another true classic from the Doc and quite addicting in the discovery stage, thank-you yet again Reiner (no wonder he has a cult :) ).

An abstract game that I like.  I like the nature of the initial placement and how that impacts your strategy.  Multiple ways to get points as in most Knizia games.  Pastel camels take it over the edge.  I'm not generally a huge fan of abstracts but this is one of the best that I've played.

Simple and a lot of fun. I can't get my wife to play war games, so this is what I play to scratch that spatial strategy, area control itch. It is pretty deep and takes some good strategic thought despite how cute it is.

RATING: 7
Great game, BAD colors. I mostly hate that the blue and green are so close, in dim light they're hard to tell apart. Aside from that this is a very good game, especially for an abstract game. This is possibly a Go spinoff.

A super easy game to explain - after 4 minutes you're already playing the game.  And in a player's turn - it's easy to know what you have to do - place two camels!  The challenge only comes from knowing where to place them!  Because of this - I would recommend this to new gamers or for hard core gamers to get newbies into the world of gaming!

Too abstract a math puzzle, if you like any theme whatsoever.  It's not "through" the desert or through anything.  It's basically a neat Go variant.  Looks cool, but it might as well be a black and white board with Pente pieces on it.  Game mechanics are very sound.  But don't be fooled if you like your game to actually have a feel to it.  This is solid, but oh-so-dry.

Pastel camels.  Area control.  Claim the tiles for points.  Did I mention the pastel camels?

It's like that."

Expand your camel caravans across the desert, claiming waterholes and oasises, and closing off territory for yourself. Nice game, but don't let the cute camels mislead you into expecting a light but thematic German game. This is an abstract brain-burner! And dry. Very dry... :)

Initial Rating: 6.0 (March 2012)

It’s been years since I last played Through the Desert. I remember I never liked it very much but the game looks great on the table. The components are very nice. I bought the game recently so I hope to play it again soon. When I do, I will come back to make a proper comment.

I finally played the game again.

The theme is ok but Through the Desert is an abstract game so you don’t feel it.

The rules are very easy to explain, you can do it under 8 minutes. Playtime is around 45 minutes.

The game´s components are great looking.

The game´s decisions aren’t obvious but aren’t very hard either. You can play it very fast. I should like it more but for some reason I don’t. Perhaps I could appreciate it better as a two player game, but with lots of players your plans will be for naught and it becomes a tactics endeavor.

Bottom line, Through the Desert is not a game for me. It is light and quick but it looks great on the table. I already sold my copy of the game. It can be a good family game.

Great game. Simple rules, delicately balanced decisions, a variety of different ways to score points, attractive components, and a quick playing time. The variable set up adds to replayability as the board layout will be different each time. When I play it with my kids I place the waterhole tokens face down to add an element of luck and reduce the analysis required (which obviously only works in editions in which the waterhle tokens are all the same shape). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Awesome game that can be taught to newbies in minutes.  Like a lot of  Knizia's games the complication is in the scoring.  Make sure that people understand all the ways that they can score points.

After half a dozen plays, including five as a two-player game, I rate this one a nine. It's a great game.

Highly recommended.

I can't get enough of this game! It's the best two-person game I've found. It's easy to learn the rules, and at first it seems like a fairly simple game, but as I play it more and more, I've come to realize how complex it really is. Every turn there are numerous things you need to do, but only two camels! Should I try to enclose, or should I aim for the oasis, or should I cut off my opponent, or should I...AHHHHH!!!!  Need more camels!

And I love the camels so much I like to take them out of their little baggies and play with them. CAMELS! They look delicious, don't they?  And look at the little faces of the camel riders!  It's my favorite game right now. I have to bribe my husband to play it with me AGAIN by promising to play Connect Four with him (he wins about 8 out of 10 Connect Four games).  So far we're tied at Through the Desert.  And, yes, we do keep track.

Wonderful game, lovely bits.  We love it 3- & 4-player, and it's pretty good with 5.  With 2 it is AWESOME, though it can be a tad nasty.  We play in 20-30 minutes with 3 & 4 players.
---
I've started playing it 2P online, and am getting used to it.  As with many of Knizia's games, the 2P game is much different than the MP games, and takes some getting used to.  In fact, I'm now finding I prefer it 2P, but only with people that don't mind a hard-fought, sometimes nasty game.

Takes Go, shrinks the board, adds kooky scoring and the hightened chaos of more players, essentially turning it into a lighter, family-style game. This is a true cross-over game, which gamers and non-gamers can both enjoy, but maybe for different reasons. I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just pick two camels and put 'em on the board (very few rules regard where you can place 'em). The trick is to figure out how to place those two camels so that they maximize help to you and block your opponents from scoring. It's a very elegant game and I liked it a lot.

Sinceramente, es un juego del que esperaba más.

Se trata de hacer caravanas de camellos en distintos colores, tratando de llegar a palmeras, oasis o encerrar áreas para conseguir puntos.

No está mal, y es un juego para pensar, pero hay otras opciones que pondría por delante de ésta. Hay gente que lo compara con el Go, si lo que quieres es un juego de ese tipo para 2 jugadores hazte con un buen Go.

A lot of cute pieces that need some extra packing material to be easy to use. Small fishing equipment boxes are perfect for them. The game is better than I thought. Different from other ones I have. The board could have been made of much better material: It is hard to get it straight.

I knew this was a pretty abstract game so I tried it out with a buddy of mine who likes games like Go. This was an instant hit and I immediately wanted to try it again. I really enjoy the desert "theme" even if it doesn't have much to do with the gameplay; it still adds considerably to the experience for me. The whole "different players using same color camels but diff. riders" took some getting used, and is different in an enjoyable way. The first time I ever saw the pastel camels I was really turned off, but they've grown on me...

I won this when my Duke Blue Devils won the bball championship and I got 2nd in the Thoughthammer contest (2010). Thanks Thoughthammer for adding such a gem to my collection!

Finally got a copy of this game. I like the bits!

RATING: 9
An extremely elegant and fun "tile" (camel) laying game.  In 45 minutes, players experience a full game narrative.  First, players are sniping at short range scoring opportunities.  As the game develops, players focus on strategic placement, seeking to secure area and points, and to hem in their opponents.  Finally, players balance the prior objectives with securing majorities for large caravans.

Both exceptionally simple and rich.

Enjoyable (though completely laughable in its implementation) theme with wonderful bits.  The camels are classic, and somehow really add to the enjoyment of the game.  This is a great type of game to have at your disposal - plays extremely quickly, is easy to teach and can provide a completely satisfying game experience.  One can invest as much thought as desired, and is involved the entire time.  I've only played with 2 and 3, and it seems like 3 would be the best number.  5 would be way too crowded, but 3 feels just right.

Being a Go player this DOESN'T appeal. It's never going to surpass Go and so it's going to dissapoint if thought of in that way.
Great way to get people into Go though, I imagine. It's a simple game with a certain depth of play. Some analysis could be useful. Elegant gameplay and nice bits. I'd recommend to a non-Go player who might be put off by the idea of an abstract.
Could be subject of paralysis analysis.

The components for this game may very well be my favorite out of any other game in my collection.  Like Samurai and T&E, I absolutely love the piece placement and mechanic system in this.  While this game might not have as much tactical value as the two other games (although I may be wrong) I find that this game is much easier to teach, and for many people a lot more fun.

RATING: 8
On each of your turns you have a need for 10 camels, but you can only use 2. That is great.  Pastelca(ra)mels are really cool, but the colours of the camels are not easily distinguishable from each other when lights are not perfect. That's not so good. Add to that the camel riders and you may get lost on the board. Also a negative thing is that players most probably aren't really aiming at playing with all of their colours but are instead using maybe 1 or 2 colours just to screw others. In the end there may arise a situation where a player simply loses no matter what he does. Despite all these little negatives I think this is a really good and tactically deep game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A solid example of how chaos and strategy do not need to be opposites on a continuum. Managing what will be there on the following turns, and what you're willing to risk, where it's worth blocking opponents, is the heart of the game. I'm not entirely sure how, but this game takes a 2P spatial abstract game (which I usually hate), and keeps that feel with multiple player, without being AP-inducing. Again, Knizia impresses me.

This is another Knizia game that I adore.  It is a wonderful gateway game.  I introduced it to my parents and they loved it.  Another guy from church bought it after I introduced it to him.  You place cute and colorful camels on the board and score points all along the way.  There are agonizing decisions and that is what I think makes a game great.  Through the Desert is no exception.

I managed to find a second hand copy.  This game is fantastic, with a great looking board, the candy camels and trees.  Also, it is very strategic and I love the fact that the players have some control over the endgame, i.e. when one camel color runs out.  Setup can be a bit fiddly with different numbers of camels available for different numbers of players, but that is a small negative.

This is rated as a two-player game, I like it somewhat less with more.  I do like games with a spatial element and where you place things very much matters in this game (And as in many abstract games initial placement is also crucial).  You balance tactical goals of grabbing victory chips with mid-term goals of connecting to a limited number of oasis's along with longer term goals of encompassing territory and even having the longest caravan in as many colors as possible.  Balancing that continually is what makes the game so interesting especially considering that you only get to play two camels on each turn.  There is also a limited supply of each color so, especially in a two-player game, you can factor in choices that hinder what your opponent can do (i.e. Take camels in a color such that he/she can no longer finish encircling a territory or get a longer caravan in that color, etc.).  This is one of my wife's favorite games.

Acquired pre-2003. Total number of plays > 20. Pastel camels! This game has a very tight design. Agonizing choices. Only problem is that initial placement can be quite important strategically, and newcomers will have no sense of how to strategize. Short-term tactics on the other hand are fairly easy to pick up.

This is a great gateway game that has a lot of depth.  It is so simple and attractive that people want to give it a try, and the limited options make it a game that newbies can feel competent in from the very beginning.  There is a great balance in this game, because while game play itself is very simple, its multiple scoring options generate many different strategic and tactical decisions. It's a really good game for 2-5 people that can bridge the gap between gamer and "regular" people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like many of Knizia's abstracts, it's simple, it has only a few rules to remember, yet it has the depth of multiple variable calculus. And mastering the game might require that level of education. Half the game is making the best of your initial camel placement - the other half is making those placements score as much as you planned to.

Few abstracts for more than two players really work out, but this one does. That it is disguised with a desert theme and pastel camels makes it work all the better with kids. I find that kids do well with abstracts, and this is a good one for keeping them engaged in the game (they cannot resist the camels!) while exercising their brain matter.

Wins (3 out of 6)
German version bought. 
Give it the same rating as Carcassonne. My favourite game so far. (have to properly play caylus, puerto Rico, Power Grid and Tigris and euphrates yet)
It's better than carcassonne because it cancel's out luck factor of tile draw. (There are house rules in carcassonne that allow you to allways have two tiles in stock) It is worse because another play can make it possible in the end game to take two camels he doesn't need just to give someone else the oppertunity to give her the longest caravan and end the game. Allthough the  player doesn't have a chance to win. In other words because games are close,it is possible for the loser to determine the winner in one or two turns.
This means that if i come along other games that know how to deal with this problem the score isn't likely to go up.
Because of it's easy rules and quick play. It is highly recommended as a filler. I think it's better than ticket to ride. I am a bit surprised that this isn't mentioned as much  as a gateway game.
Highly recommended.
Oh yes components are brilliant. Maybe the colour of the camels aren't ideal for those suffering of colourblindness. 

Update
Confirmed as a top game after play with family.
Recommended to all. There is enough depth in it. Has great replayvalue.

Played with one twelve year old and a thirty year old ;twelve year old won because we were to nice :) And when we saw the danger it was to late.
Rules and different options are easy to grasp.

Update. This game gets the first nine. I can't stop thinking about it.
:)
Update 04-04-07. With four players this game is too fast and you loose a lot of control.
It is a 10 as a two player game. 
A 8.4 as a 3Pgame. And a 7.5 as a 4Pgame

Although the theme is weaker than usual, it remains one of Knizia's master designs. It's actually quite hard to care that a theme is tacked-on when it's so damn charming. Balancing what you need to do now and what can wait until later keeps the tension high, and with four different ways of scoring points, the game stays fresh from beginning to end. [b]8.5[/b]

Through the Desert is a good game, but it feels like there is something missing: now it’s a little bit dry and dull (like desert, yeah!). But even so I like to play  this game every now and then. I suggest to play this one with 4 or 5 players - with three it's not interesting enough (even you use the smaller game area).

Each player attempts to score the most points by snaking caravan routes through the desert, trying to reach oases and blocking off sections of the desert. Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.

 In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.

[2007.Jun.11] A must play for all gamers. This Reiner Knizia tile-laying game is an area control game at its core. The Fantasy Flight Games edition with its pastel camels is quite nice, but the board itself could be a bit bigger. Although only being able to place 2 camels on the board per turn leads to quick gameplay, it can lead to some truly agonizing decisions. ("Argh! If I could only place 1 more camel!?!") And one more thing, don't eat the camels!

Several games.  Yes.  I like this game.  I don't find it cute; I find it to be a cold, hard, unforgiving bastard, with a ton of screwage.  I should hate it, but I can't!  Not crazy about the 2 player version though; I like it better not knowing exactly where the knife is coming from.

On the upside this is very quick to play (although a tad too long to setup relative to length).  On the downside, the actual play is somewhat boring.  There is certainly some strategy but it remains pretty light.  The initial clutter makes the board busy and it's hard to really get caravans of satisfying length or cordon significant area.  It's well balanced and it works but it sorts of falls flat for me.  It's all about exploiting "technicalities" and the end is often anticlimactic and predictable.  I've seen worst, but this game is a very atypical of this designer.

Area control with pastel camels...

RATING: 4
Pastel Camels!? ... BAD COLOR SELECTION. I am partially color blind which gives me the problem of confusing colors close to each other. So with pastel camels, it's hard to analyze the board when there are many, many colors on the board including player colors. So it makes some sort of color confusion. Besides that the game is average, it does not facinate me too much.

One of my favorite Gateway games as I find it works excellent with introducing casual gamers & non-gamers alike while offering a great deal of depth for serious gamers.  It's a very elegant and has subtle depth and strategy.  It's a pure/no-luck perfect info. game with rules that scales perfectly for differently for 3, 4 or 5 players.  If you want a multi-plyr game that has NO randomness, then give this one a try.  A good setup really helps your chances of scoring well.

I still can't understand the point in having the grey camels...do people really forget their colors if they're not on a useless camel next to the board?  It's still a pretty neat game, however.  And, I like the dorky pastel camels.

Deep decisions at every move, and yet it never feels too heavy.  Four ways to score points, a constantly changing board, and a total lack of luck means you've got to stay on your toes the entire game.  A favorite in our group.  I just taught this to my 10-year-old sister, and she likes it too.

This is one of those games that provokes post-game analysis:  "If you hadn't blocked me from that last Oasis, she wouldn't have won!"  And all this folds nicely into a 30 or 40 minute game.  Yes, I'll play "Through the Desert" once or twice a week if I can.

People talk about "Ticket to Ride" being a "good gateway game", but why not this?  This has a similar objective (link chains of objects to reach your goals), but has infinitely greater depth, simpler rules, and more charming bits!  Nobody doesn't love pastel camels.

I can think of at least one way the game could be better, though.  They should have included a variable board, or moveable obstacles, that would make each match truly different and prevent fixed placement strategies.

Great strategy and tactics placement game.  There are four scoring categories (water, oasis, encircled regions, long caravans); this makes your strategy evolves during a single game, which is pleasant.  Sometimes feels like Go: the camels do not move and you can score by encircling regions, which creates a strong pressure to build territory (while trying to reach water holes and oasis at the same time).  My 6 year old likes it very much, but it is also a good game for gamers.

Dull and repetitive, I see no point of the game if you don't have a horribly competitive game group. The game goes in circles when people is taking turns to place the initial camels, then again and again, and again...

RATING: 7
Many have compared this game to Go, but I don't see the comparison. Go takes forever to play and strategies for playing are quite mysterious (despite simple rules). Oddly, Through the Desert has more rules, but it is easier to play and appears to have straightforward strategies. Further, the theme (though ridiculous) makes the game more approachable than Go.

That said, the game is still very dry and moves seem fairly obvious to me. Further the S/O does not like pure abstract games so this does not get much love at our house.

First of all, do not eat the camels! I know they look tasty, but they're only plastic.

Through the Desert is a clever and distinctive near-abstract from the heyday of the grandmaster Knizia. While I disagree with the description "multiplayer Go", the purity of this design shines through.

Through the Desert is a network building game, not all that far removed from Ticket to Ride, really (or, rather, I wonder how much TtD inspired TtR). Unlike TtR, however, the routes are built on a hex grid instead of preplanned, More significantly, players are not trying to connect two randomly selected points; they have to navigate a myriad of scoring opportunities.

I think the only thing separating Through the Desert from true greatness is the slightly uninspiring scoring. It's well-balanced, but a little flat and workmanlike. I think a little more Ra or Tigris & Euphrates in its scoring DNA would give TtD the shot in the arm it needs to become one of the top tier of euros.

Nevertheless, for a half-hour game that's simple enough for children to play, there is plenty to think about, enough planning not to feel hollow, and enough player interaction to produce the occasional four-letter word. Now that FFG is reprinting TtD again, I need to fill this hole in my collection.

I love Knizia and abstract strategy....and pastel camels ...As you build chains of camels and make connections to the oases for points, you struggle to keep majority in the different colors. You also try to corner off some landscape for some extra points. This is a very nice abstract, and can easily win over those who dislike abstracts.

Not an exciting game at all.  It feels like Samurai a bit, but at least in Samurai you get the impression that something can actually be done.

At least there is something to think about.

Works well with 2-5 players, I think 2 might be the best because have to score points and prevent your opponent from scoring as well.  So many ways to score points makes for a lot of tough decisions and things to keep track of, takes 20-40 minutes depending on the number of players.

One of the first Euro games I have ever played and provides me with great memories.  You have a 5 different color camels and you are trying to either connects oasis or surround spaces with your camels from one edge to another.  You also get points for the longest string of camels of a particular color.  It actually reminds me a bit of Go! in some ways.  I really like the game.  It is abstract so you need to like abstract games to like this one.  One of Reiner Knizia's better games.

Under the fancy desert/caravan/camel theme is an abstract strategy game - basically to collect the most points for your self while at the same time blocking the other players.  5-players seemed crowded making long-term planning difficult.  A must-have, if not only for the pastel-coloured camels.

This a real Knizia the way I like them: 
Elegant and consistent mechanics all the way through, easy to learn, very hard to master, nice physical design.

It's quite abstract, but doesn't feel all that dry - maybe due to the pastel camels, or maybe because it's strategically so complex, that you can't really analyse more than 2 moves ahead anyway. In that way it feels more like Go than Chess, and that's very fine with me.

Obviously, this game is one of my favorites. You allways have to watch lots of factors in order to be successfull. The mixture of connecting oases, collecting watering places and forcing expansive space profit is very clever and challenging. Never forget to gain points by color majorities!

                                                                  
[COLOR=#0000FF]Selten fand ich den Ausspruch "Reiner Knizia muss eine Maschine sein!" (so unberechtigt er auch sein mag) passender als mit Bezugnahme auf dieses Spiel. Durch die Wüste ist so perfekt ausbalanciert und mathematisch optimal konstruiert, dass es den Anschein hat, als habe ein fehlerfreies Programm das Spiel entwickelt.
Hinzu kommt die sehr runde Gestaltung durch den Verlag, der das Spiel weder unnötig verniedlicht noch übertrieben abstrahiert hat. Die thematische Einbindung des Mechanismus ist hervorragend geglückt und lässt Durch die Wüste enorm "dicht" erscheinen. Wäre da nicht dieses grandiose und hervorragende Spielsystem, ich würde das Spiel vermutlich allein ob der hübschen und überaus funktionellen pastellfarbenen Kamele verehren.[/COLOR]

We have only played this game a few times, but it really has not caught our fancy. The game is almost purely strategic, with very little luck or randomness. In addition, we really don't find the game play very interesting - it gets very mechanical to drop camels on the board. Finally (and a bit surprising to us), we really don't like the bits and pieces. The board doesn't lay flat and the pastel camel colors are just ugly. It just seems cheap. Overall, the theme and presentation are not very interesting. I can see the possibilities for strategic play, if this is what you are looking for. It is just not our cup of tea.

Pretty good with 2.  Even though the choice of 'this' camel or 'that' camel seems simple, it certainly builds a nice bit of tension when you realise you need 'the other' camel too.

A classic.  Not because of the silly camels.  This feels like some ancient game that has just been given the modern production.  So many possibilities in each game, and you'll always be left wanting to do more than you could before the game ends.

I like this game. I think its all works well and usually enjoy playing it, however I find I do not play often. It is very dry and now that I am getting over the eurogame craze I don't pick this one off the shelf much. It is hard for me to get fired up about placing pastel camels in a line on a board. For me, right now, thats not enough.

Have a sinking feeling I won't like this when my husband crushes me for the 50th or so time--I never do very well at abstract strategy/perfect information games, he's much more strategic than I am.  But for now, the after-dinner-mint camels and meeple-riders are just enchanting!  The play in Oasis is a bit more interesting, but the camples just aren't pastel.

Enjoyable tile-placement/area enclosure game.  Can be a little dry (no pun intended).  I think I enjoy this more with 3-4 players than with 2 because it's not such a tightly fought battle.  With 3 or 4 you can breathe a little more easily, have a bit more fun.

Finally got a game of this in; started playing and both players seemed indifferent but once the board started to fill-up and the possibilities for cutting your opponent off or enclosing areas started to come to light, it became much more interesting (I can now see why the comparison to GO has been made)  Initial placement is crucial.........watch this space. Now played it with 3 players and it was a tighter and more intense experience. I look forward to more players and more games.

My wife and I have played this three times.  After the first game we knew that this was going to be a favorite because it was easy, fun, and challenging.  Its simplicity and enjoyment reminds us of Lost Cities.  And pastel camels with palm trees!  The only mean things you can do are limiting the areas of opponents or cutting them off -- neither of which isn't that deadly so it's good if your partners don't like aggressive games.  (I've played Go for years.  It has nothing to do with Go.  If, besides territory, you could surround and kill your opponents caravans then it would begin to be have Go-ness.)

A game that initially I thought was a bit slow, but am enjoying more and more. Reminicent of Go, although I find this game far more enjoyable.  Also, multiplayer abstracts are far less intense than 2 player abstracts.  Would be interesting to play with VPs on the board hidden from the get go, although I understand why this might be broken.  Plays quickly, which is vital -- with over analysis this game would be terrible. UPDATE: This game wins over new players just as well as Modern Art and I love it more and more.  I'm sliding it up to a '10'... funny how many Knizias have gotten there.

Geez, I suck at abstracts. The great thing is that TTD is light, quick (about 25 minutes with 2) and lends itself to a fun family-style game because of the cuteness factor. I really like it, even though I will probably lose 8 out of every 10 plays.

RATING: 7
Played 10-15 times. OK, so a 9 was probably overdoing it, but it´s at least a 7 or maybe an 8. You don´t have a lot of control, so you just have to let some things go and build on others. It´s more the journey than the scoring, I think.
- - -
A simple, clever game, with short playing-time, turn angst and meaningful decisions. Only drawback is the set-up where you always have to count camels, sort camels and remove camels. Number of camels depends on the number of players, so I haven´t found a good way to sort the camels in the box. It´s a small complaint, but a fiddly set-up feels more fiddly in a filler like this. I guess it´s the price we pay for good scalability, which this game has. Anyway, a really good game that I´m always happy to play.

As far as Euros are concerned, I do not think this game is quite as dry as other gamers make it out to be.  That being said, it also isn't very engaging.  Visit the high-point water holes, make sure you connect to the oases, ropes off large chunks of desert, try to get longest chain of given camel colors, all the while blocking your opponents from doing the same.  I take that back.  It is pretty dry.

Based on 2 plays and half. At a first glance seems very similar to Go, but it isn't. However it is an interesting abstract.In 5 players the 10 colours (5 camels and 5 riders) can create a lot of confusion.However, the impossibility of a deep strategy makes it a tactical game and avoids analysis paralysis which would otherwise kill it.

This is almost abstract game where you musta get points by placing two camels per turn. You get points by placing camels to water holes and side to oasis. Also rounding desert you can get many points. In the end longest camel caravans of every color got points. There is no luck in game and every choise is critical. I like this game and I like also this little theme that this got.

RATING: 7
A very simple game as far as what you are actually required to do in the game.  However, there are quite a few layers of strategy as you try to enclose areas off with your camel trains and try to get to palm trees before others can.  A good game overall.

Played it 1 time with 2 players. Accessible, abstract game with a nice (pasted-on) theme. On your turn: will you block your opponent or are you enhancing your own position? Even if the playfield is smaller for 2 players, I think the gameplay would be better with more players: need to try it with more players.

Edit: with more plays this game gets better and better. It takes a while to see the strategy. I like the game more with more players than 2.

This one can be hard to get onto the table with newbies or non-gamers. It took a couple of tries, and finally my insisting we give it a go. Perhaps the box art just isn't as grabbing as some others. Stick with it though, once you get them to play.. they'll love it. Simple rules and concepts, hard to plot and plan. Such tough decisions in following the simple task of placing 2 camels. Really, its abstract strategy with the most adorable bits ever. Don't pass up the camels, you won't be sorry. Plays great with 2 and 3!

This was one I wasn't really interested in playing. At first glance, I really had trouble differentiating all the pastel camels and their crazy riders. The board seemed cluttered with no rhyme or reason. I was wrong!!!! This one is so much fun. I love abstracts and love Knizia, so I should have known I would like this. Played with 4, which makes for a lot of fun! Plays quickly and is easy to grasp. I loved watching the caravans form and trying to guess what your opponents are trying to accomplish. It's quite a balance trying to decide to build your caravan or screw up what your opponents are trying to do. I like this one better than Tigris & Euphrates.

Another brilliant work from our friend Knizia, this game will catch your eye for the pastel tone of the bits.  They truly look like candy.  In fact, my daughter always take one and simulate to eat it and she giggle all the way.

The conversation always seems to run something like this at the end of a Knizia game:

Me: "Good game."
GF: "Yes. Would you like to play again?"
Me: "No." 
It's hard to convey how emphatically this is delivered. 

I never play this more than once in a run of playing games. It's always engaging, but never fun somehow. One for the head, not the heart, I think.

I appreciate Herr Knizia's skill as a designer, but I haven't loved anything of his I've so far played.

Camels? What camels? As a slightly disturbed owner of three-billion glass beads I went against the will of nature and dropped everything from the game. We rather use [url=http://boardgame.geekdo.com/user/ZeroCool_ITA]Francesco Neri[/url]'s marvellous board with beads, and play it as an abstract. In your face Reiner, in your face.

(The pastel camels kill me with my colorblindness in any room without really bright light.  But I like it anyway.)

Nice looking 3d abstract with camels. As usual with a good Knizia game there are many things too keep in mind. Fairly easy rules, fun & fast to play.

Don't be fooled by the Go comparison, because in the end the amount of land is worth less than the oasis and color points. Better game with 3 players than with 2.

NL: Go met pastelkleurige kamelen? Daar lijkt het een beetje op, maar toch heel anders. Ook leuk met 2.

Very fun game!  Easy rules and quick play can make you think, "Is that all there is to it?" but there is a lot going on here.  Great decisions, great player interactions, filled with "Aha!" moments.  The only tiny negative is that the shades of pastel are somewhat similar in low lighting, but you've got to love the camels.  A very entertaining game!

Game in a Nutshell: Alternate playing camels in order to claim area and score points in several different ways.

Played as: 2,3,4,5 players

Pros: I love the contention. It's hard not to make a move that doesn't seem like you're after one person or another.

Cons: I feel it takes a few plays to generate interest rather then loving it the first time. Partially because the theme does nothing to excite one past seeing pastel camels and also because without the theme, it's still just a bland idea for an abstract that works as well as it does because you can't help but step on each others toes.

Other: For the most part, this game has been outdone by Kingdom Builder which has a similar feel but much more variety. The one thing this has over that is a simpler entry point and a bit more interaction. I didn't like playing this with two or five players for opposite reasons: With two there was surprisingly less direct competition and more straight forward decisions, and with five the game became too crowded and nearly unmanageable.

Best Use: Still unsure here (due to the love-it or hate-it reaction it's invoked so far) but I'd say best for 3-4 players with more of a gateway crowd.

RATING: 5
After ~1 play.  Weird.  A connection game with chrome (arbitrarily desert-caravan-themed, no less). The comparisons with Go are wrong.  A better comparison is Y.  It's solid mechanics-wise, but if I'm gonna play a connection game, it's gonna be Hex, or Y, or Star, or Gonnect, or Projex, or any of a large number of far superior games.

It's redeeming quality is that it introduces Euro-gamer-types to the joys of connection games, of which they are usually ignorant because they tend to overlook abstracts while being distracted with shiny plastic/wooden things.

The only reason this gets a 5 (which is not a bad rating for me) is that it is essentially a connection game, a mechanic I adore.  There is something off-putting about the meaningless theme and pointless chrome.  It doesn't sit well on this kind of game, maybe because I am so used to the "purity" of other connection games.

La verdad es que es un juego que nunca me ha llamado mucho. Lo he visto en las mesas de muchos jugones unas cuantas veces, desde hace 2 o 3 años cuando Edge se lanzó a la aventura de traducir juegos de mesa aquí en España. Los materiales no son malos, pero como ya comentamos, los colores son matadores. El juego en sí no me pareció malo. Las estrategias pueden ser muy diversas e interesantes, algo parecido a los que ocurre con Pingüinos y Cia. Hay más "chicha" de lo que aparentemente se ve y no es juego escesivamente complicado o díficil  para jugadores nóveles. Está claro que como todo juego de vecino, necesita más partidas para sacarle todo su potencial. Knizia es un buen diseñador de juegos, sobre todo en cuanto a juegos de enfrentamiento directo por puntos se refiere. Me encanta su juego para 2 "Scarab Lords" y éste, aunque poco tiene que ver, lleva el enfrentamiento de recolecta de puntos contra un grupo más amplio de jugadores. Aún así lo veo demasiado límitado a la hora de evitar que los jodepartidas hagan su trabajo. El hecho de que se termine el juego cuando la reserva de uno de los colores de camellos se acabe, facilita que si alguién quiere joder la partida no por táctica, sino por jodienda al resto de jugadores, no se pueda evitar.

Played on an iPad app and I beat the hardest AIs (3-player games) few times in a row right after learning the rules. My strategy was simply to surround (and capture) a very large area at one of the edges of the board where other players weren't bothering me too much - it gave me many points for the surrounded area + the bonus for that color. Bots were pretty much doing the same thing but just less successfully. It felt like a solitaire without any real interaction.
Maybe bots just suck or I am missing some deeper aspect of the game, but so far it looks very simplistic to me.

Fun for nongamers too.

Hurts the eyes, hurts the brain. I have just found out that there is such a thing as too much turn angst -- and this is it. On any given turn there were maybe 10-15 different actions I wanted to take, and only 2(!!) are allowed.

A very nice Knizia game.  Go-like capturing of sections (plus additional mechanics with largest caravan/claiming oasis) makes for a powerful game.

Plastic camels, indeed. I don't play this as much as I used to (unlike [gameid=3], I did play Through the Desert before I started logging plays). This is a shame, because it has excellent replayability due to random elements of the setup. I don't like the Go comparisons, which I feel are superficial. Making territory is only one aspect of this multi-faceted game. There are very few 2-player abstracts which also work well with more players, and this is one of them. The two-moves-(in this case, camels)-per-turn idea is one which I'd like to try in several other games.

The game just feels great: the turn angst is finely tuned, and you have to pay attention to all areas of scoring. So it overcomes my preference for games where you don't have to do a lot of counting to find out who won. Once upon a time, I rated this a 10. I don't know why I ever lowered it.

The best thing about those camels is you can never make up your mind on how to name their color. I was never told those pastel colors at school!

* Beautifully produced abstract, complete with pastel camels
* Gameplay is simple (place two camels) but decisions are deliciously difficult
* Typical Knizia, in that scoring is math-based and dependent upon majorities
* More players at the table greatly increase the amount of player screwage
* Bit of a learning curve, as newbies may not see the strategies of enclosing/blocking
* Good with any number of players and Knizia fans
* Initial rating: [b]8/10[/b]

Great game. Sort of like a free-form Ticket to Ride. Camels have a bit of a goofy expression, but otherwise, the components are top notch. Better with three players. The main problem is that the colors are very similar to someone with red-green colorblindness (and even to those with normal color vision). Why not make them more distinct color-wise?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Neat area control game where you build herds of different-colored camels; the multiple methods for acquiring points (placing camels near oases, placing camels on point chips, enclosing areas of the board, and having the largest herd of any one color) and extremely limited move options (you can only place 2 camels per turn, far fewer than you'd like to) make the game very interesting.  The game is competitive (in that you can block other players), but not aggressive (in that you can't destroy other players pieces).  Rules are simple to explain and understand; possibly a good game for non-gamers who are interested in gaming.

Fun and fast. This light game is a nice placement/area control type game where players try to extend their caravan of camels through the desert to connect them to water holes and oasis and surround certain areas.

A great game. It was interesting to hear Dr. Knizia himself speak of this game with such fondness. I agree that it is one of his very best games. Works well with two players, even better with three, and perhaps best with four. By the way, Durch is mostly not Go-like: it's multi-player; there's no capturing; enclosing territory is just one of four ways to score (two tactical, two strategic); each turn you place two camels; it's much shorter, and no where near as deep. [more than 22 plays]

RATING: 5.5
I liked the idea of the game, but there is too much of an "anti-" streak to this game. By this I mean, you make actions specifically intended to hurt another player without boosting your own position. Games like this enable stubborn players or those who have no hope of winning to "mess with" the game on a level I just don't fully like.  For example, one person could do very well, and be trailed by two other players.  A final player could be doing horribly, and then can decide just to mess with the leader. They can cripple the chances for a win by that leader, only by completely ruling themselves out of the game. I guess I like games which reward playing to win over playing to ruin another player's chances of winning.

Definitely a great "gateway" option. Rules are explained in 5 minutes. It scales from 2 to 5 players. The board's different every time. It takes only 20 minutes to play and actually provides some deep play for experienced gamers. Fantastic.

Unfortunately, there's only so much you can play this kind of game before it gets a little old. About 30 plays in, it's just not that alluring as anything other than an introductory game that isn't boring. Don't get me wrong--it's unbeatable in that role--but with experienced gamers there are just a whole lot of other games I'd rather play.

The game itself is a lot of fun and while the gameplay is quite simple there are some pretty deep strategies involved. I can see us getting a lot of use out of this one as we get a better grip of how the game.

Well work a try, particularly if you enjoy seeing a table populated by pastel camels!

RATING: 7.5
A solid almost-abstract. Has Knizia's trademark focus on balancing your scoring (in this case keeping your caravans similar lengths so you can sweep up the 10 point length bonuses at game-end). The production is fine, but the board is really ambiguous in the shaded regions of the board - is this a space or not? Semi-cut-throat yet almost Zen-like at the same time.

Easy rules, yet some considerable depth. The camels are cute and my collection was heavily missing some game with camels. :)
I heartily recommend the "Variations" here on BGG, with drawing a few extra cards in the beginning, with things to score in the end. It doesn't change the outcome much (and the gameplay at all), but it greatly increases the replayability.

Elsőre a Samarkand ugrott be róla, de van benne egy kis Ticket to Ride is. Illetve fordítva! Ebből a játékból merítettek sokat, ami nem is baj, Kniziatól lesni sosem az!
Gyors, letisztult, konfrontatív versengős taktikai absztrakt. Szeressem!

Wow! Je découvre beaucoup trop tardivement l'univers des jeux de société, et, au sommet de celui-ci, la trilogie des jeux de positionnement de Reiner Knizia. 

Si Tigris & Euphrates demeure au sommet de mon classement depuis sa découverte en 2012, Samurai et Through the Desert, découverts respectivement en février et avril 2014, sont instantanément des jeux qui s'accaparent d'une place dans mon "Top 10".

Joué pour le moment à deux reprises à trois joueurs (deux parties dans la même soirée contre les mêmes joueurs), je vois mal comment nous pourrons résister à l'idée d'y rejouer lorsque nous nous reverrons!

Tout le monde essaie de jouer des coups un peu salauds, qui nuiront aux autres; mais, oh malheur, seuls deux petites actions peuvent être jouées à chaque tour!

Un délice intellectuel! =)

EDIT: J'ai rejoué depuis à 2, 3 et 4 joueurs, et il est nettement plus intéressant à 3 joueurs.

RATING: 7.2
A pretty thinky abstract. While you place only two pieces per turn, the game awards points to you in three distinct ways - enclosing areas, a race to certain point-gaining hexes, and forming the longest chains of camels. The cleverness and subtlety is excellent, however it's AP-inducing as well. Still a good game, but I prefer to play it by instincts rather than configuring the one best move.

RATING: 6
Nice little abstract that is like a complex Lost Cities mated with Ticket to Ride.  Where LC has 4 color-coded cards that get played in ascending numerical order, this has 5 pastel colored camel sets that get added to a "caravan."  Points are scored when the caravans cross a numbered water marker, hit up against an oasis marker or block off a section of the board.  

This isn't a game to take overly seriously.  I like how points are accumulated as the game goes along.  I also like that it's quick to play and easy to teach (works just fine with my 10 and 14 y.o. daughters).  I don't like how crowded the board gets.  So far I've only played two-person with each of my daughters, and that already produces a vaguely constipated gaming experience.  Three-player would be similar to two because all of the board gets used, rather than just most.  Anything more than three-player, I wouldn't want to play.

Somewhat dry (LOLOLOLOL) game with Knizia's patented numerical balancing of arbitrary scoring mechanisms. Reasonably fun but not exciting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game from Knizia. Each turn, play two colored camels (from five different colors) to earn points by : 1) connecting to point score markers, 2) connect to an oasis, 3) seal off areas, 4)get majority in camel colors.  A lot of player interaction determines the outcome of the game (an opponent might shut you out of an oasis, prevent you from forming walls). Being an older Knizia game (like Samurai), this game hasn't been played lately.

Between the cute pieces, the random setup, and the attractive theme, this somehow feels less like an abstract than it otherwise might. It's easy to grasp, yet very difficult to master, especially if playing with skilled players. The game feels like a war fought on many fronts, forcing players to prioritize scoring opportunities while others slide away. A classic.

I tried playing this on Ludagora.net but had no idea what I was doing. I finally had a chance to play the actual game face-to-face and it now all makes sense.

Thankfully I can determine this through playing online.

Many people have described Through The Desert as Go With Camels, but a more apt description would be Hey! That's My Oasis!

Compared to Hey! That's My Fish!, TtD has a more complex scoring system and a set number of units (5 caravan leaders instead of 2-4 penguins). The fact that camels are placed on the tiles rather than the tiles being lifted away is the main gameplay digference. These changes are enough to elevate TtD from the kids game of H!TMF! to a more family-weight experience. Neither are particularly energetic plays, but the increased complexity of TtD makes it the better game.

This one was a surprise.  Got a lot of 3 games on E-bay for about $12 a piece shipped.  I hadn't even heard of this one until then.  I was more interested in the other two (Jambo and Pecking Order).  But this one has the most plays by far.  Nice strategic game play with just enough randomness with the placement of resources to mix things up.  It also scales nicely between 2 and 5 and doesn't seem to suffer in the transition, a feat many games cannot accomplish.
My only con is the setup can be really annoying because the number of camels varies by player count and sorting camels is annoying.

It's a very solid design as to expect from Knizia. I like to play this one with 3 players. I definitely now know I don't want to play it with 5 players. There are no unknown elements in the game but it doesn't feel too chess-like. Only problem really is that setuping the game takes quite a while. Rating is for 2 and 3 player game. As a (4 or) 5 player player game I'd rate this somewhere between 5 and 6.

Adorable pastel camels, and there's a really good game, too! Lightish, fun, and attracts non-gamers but it's a gamer's game nevertheless.

Like with Samurai, and Tigris & Euphrates, the two player game is not that good but I'll happily play this with any other number of players.

You really have to organize the bits using ziploc bags or tackle boxes, otherwise setting up the game is a pain.

This is a good tile placement game that plays in a short time. Theme is a bit pasted on but that is fine. There is nicely room for strategies and tactics. The components are a mixed bag. The board is really good and so are the counters. I generally do not like plastic pieces but this time I have to say the pastel colored camels are rather nice. Palm trees on the other hand are not. They look bad. The riders are the worst. Bright blue rider on a light green camel: utter kitsch! I hope I can replace the riders with colored cubes or something.

RATING: 7
Un gioiellino! Meccaniche semplici ma il gioco risulta al tempo stesso profondo e strategico. In 5 è molto caotico e complesso, in 2 diventa quasi scacchistico. Classico gioco di piazzamento decisamente astratto, non riesco a capire come possa essere venuta l'idea di ambientarlo nel deserto visto che l'area di gioco diventa presto sovrafollata. Il gioco però è molto simpatico.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Miserable colour scheme and a faint theme (to the point of superfluousness), but when you get down to it a great, thought-provoking abstract. Like Ingenious, Knizia's other great hex game, Through The Desert mandates that you keep an eye on several different things all at the same time, but with this one you can win on individual strengths, rather than spreading your resources. The player-determined endpoint is the vital rule that keeps you on your toes. I'm not happy about the gameplay/setup time ratio, though.

One of those unusual games that always makes you wish you were playing with a different number of players to the ones you currently are playing with.

This game is underrated here. Very deep pure strategy game. Also fun and easy to teach and play. It has all good points a game need to have. Fun to play with 2-3-4 players all. Players cannot easily gather and play aganist most powerfull one. Only its board and equipment are a bit old-aged.

Only one play, so can't be completely sure, but it does appeal in a similar way to Samurai, which is a good indication for me. I have only played with five, and it might be interesting to try it with fewer people. It's surprisingly quick, which is great, and you've gotta love those pastel camels.

I like this as a filler. I can't imaging playing lots of times in a row. Set-up is fiddly.

NB: useless game if you are colourblind. I repainted all the camels! Be warned. (The publishers must be idiots to have used these colours)

RATING: 8
Basically a simpler version of Go with Euro scoring and a very thin theme dusted on top. I know it's a good design because you want to do fifty things but only get two camel placements per turn. This game is dry even for Knizia though, and sometimes it seems starting placements are far more important than the rest of the game, which can kind of just play out. Very good tight game though. All plays on Android version so far.

RATING: 7
Played two 2-player games.  Fun!  It's great having 4 different places you want to go, but only 2 camels per turn.  It seemed quite balanced with 2 -- it literally came down to the last move of the game both times.  I think there would be some more lopsided scores with more players.  

OK, fun with two.  Seems really crowded and more luck based with 3, but I really need to play it a few more times with 3 and try it with 4 and 5.

Newest: I like this game, but don't love it.  I don't feel enough freedom to come up with clever moves, just hope that I can do something in the chaos before being blocked.  It's a bit too constricting for me.

I really like the flow of this game: it's peaceful and tense, simple and deep.

It can be a little slow to get going because of the importance of initial leader placement.

It's OK but I just can't love it like some people do- probably because it's abstract and has small fiddly bits. TTD is one of the few Knizia games I don't mind because the theme doesn't take itself seriously in the first place, so I'm less angry at it for having a fake theme.

Used to be one of our favorite fillers but one of my players is color-blind, and it's hard for him to differentiate the original German pastel camels. I'd bust it out a couple times a year, for sure. Nice game, smart mechanic. Little plastic camels rock, as do the little palm trees.

Dunno how much long-term replayability this game has. I feel like one or two plays a year is about right.

RATING: 9
50+ plays. Classic multiple-race game that plays smoothly and fast, and scales beautifully across different numbers of players. This has seen quite a bit of play in the family arena due to its rule simplicity and 30 minute playing time, players being attracted to the continual pressure of which threat they most need to react to each turn with only 2 actions at their disposal. There's a strategic vs tactical tradeoff to be made throughout - whether to concentrate on building a colour for the end-game bonus vs one-off points in a colour that won't get you an end-game bonus. It's a lot of punch for an otherwise shortish game, and always very enjoyable.

RATING: 4
What I like:
- Very cute components
- Quick (40 minutes for 4p learning game)
- Typical Knizia variety of scoring

What I don't like:
- Feels a lot like Go
- I don't like area control games
- I don't like games this cutthroat

It's not quite as abstract as some people say, but clearly the theme isn't strong. It is a bit daunting at first, trying to figure out the 20 chains on the board (with 4p). You always feel like there are 10 things you want to do, but can only place 2 camels per turn.

It can (and probably should be) be very cutthroat. I would put the rules weight around 2.2 and the depth around 3.0 for a weight of 2.6.

A great game of placement. You must place your camels in the longest rows but also try and collect points on the board and block off areas for large bonuses. Not as easy at you may think. Easy rules, but complex play. A great game.

RATING: 9
Some have said this game reminds them of Go and I agree to an extent.  It is shorter and lighter than Go, just more fun (in my opinion of course).  This game fits a very specific niche that few other games fit.  It doesn't take long to play and it doesn't take up a lot of room.  The compact box makes it very portable.  It's easy to teach and it's a game you can play with a variety of people: your wife, your girlfriend (hopefully not both), your parents, your kids, etc.  Its a perfect strategy game when you don't have 2 hours to spare.  But masked beneath the simplicity and fun is a game with a lot of tactical and strategic depth, yet very little "weight".  Repeated play definitely results in greater skill.

The only con I can see is that the set up time is a tad long for how long the game takes.  A 2 player game is over in 15 to 20 minutes but the game takes 5 minutes to set up.  If a game takes me 5 minutes to set up, I would like to get a good hour out of it, but that may be just a personal thing.  BTW, you can expect a 4 player game to take about 45 minutes.

UPDATE:  I actually got to play with 5 players and it was a blast.  You have to make sure you follow the specific 5 player rule where each player reduces his caravan leaders by one color and each player must eliminate a DIFFERENT color.  A surprisingly good 5 player game.

More strategically complex than Samurai, simple to learn, quick to play. 
Best with two or three.  With fewer players, strategy can be implemented, opponents can be blocked and tactics are more interesting.  With two, it is all about constricting your opponent so you can then build the longest chain in a certain color.

This is a perfect information game that combines area fencing with picking up victory point chits from the board.  It seems like to win, you have to do both instead of concentrating on one or the other.  There can be a lot of tension in the game, as blocking off your opponents is a key strategy.  There's also a bonus for longest chain of a color, forcing you to pay attention to your opponents even more.  Knizia has you juggling a lot of different goals here, which makes to a fun and tense game experience.

Played with wife (non gamer) and son (young gamer). I love this game. Not sure how long it will remain a big favorite, but I have been trying to figure out ways to introduce it to friends, and that's a good sign. Could move to a 9 if it catches on with the more serious gamers.

1/17 I have bought two copies, and given them both to family. It scales well, I've enjoyed it from 2 to 5 players. Very accessible as a lighter title, I've enjoyed it with 7 to 60 year olds in the same game. 10-27: I have purchased 3 copies of this game, given away 2. Great game.

My first play resulted in a "Meh."  The second -- which happened because the non-boardgaming wife of a friend played the first and did incredibly well -- resulted in a "Hmm."  The 3rd play -- due to that same non-boardgaming wife who won the 2nd play -- finally hooked me. 

I've also never, ever had a game which has caused so many people to stop and ask "Whatcha playing?  What's it about?" when playing in a public place.  I think the pastel camels just sell the game...

I own this on IOS and didn't regret the purchase. 

This is a good abstract game that is very easy to approach. The oasis and water pond makes the game choice obvious at first glance so new players won't hesitate to play this game. I like this game a lot more than T & E. Even though people think it's dry I think it is ok with me. The depth of the game comes out later with more plays. 

This is a perfect game to play the AI with on iPad. Somehow the game just sticks. It might be because of the tough decisions that this game offers.

Because I loved how each person got the bonus tile for the longest camel so that camel was on the bonus card the color of the camel was on the bonus card too. Because I love the green  and brown on the pslm trees mixed toegther too.

Awesome game for a small brain burn. Planning your camel moves and trying to fence out areas is really nice. I played my first games as two player and totally loved the feel of the game. Final scoring is a bit of a chore, but a small one actually. This is a nice abstract game I will look forward to play more.

RATING: 8.8
For a game that can be played in under an hour (even as low as 30 mins 2 player), this game has a decent amount of strategy and lashings of screwage.  It serves as a great gateway game due to its Knizia-esque rules simplicity.  

My only minor criticism is probably the set up time is a little longer than most other games that can be played in the same time.

I received this game as a trade for Stephensons Rocket.

Am I glad I traded away Stephensons Rocket?  I will miss that game.  But the fact that it took over an hour to play, pushed it into the Thursday night category and one of our regulars despised it - so it would rarely see the light of day.  So am I glad I traded it for camels - YES!

Beautiful. Elegant. Easy to learn, but with a lot of different possible strategies and tactics. It plays fast, as you always want to do a lot of stuff before others make that impossible. Can be quite cutthroat. I love how the turns are so simple (place two camels on the board. that's it.), yet with every turn the game becomes more exciting as you see more opportunities, for yourself and for your opponents. It might not be the deepest, most interesting game in my collection, but it just might be the most fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For some reason this game makes me thirsty for victory points. I think it is because the vps are visually and mentally easy to obtain: picking up waterholes and hitting the oasis are close to your camel trains and surrounding territories can scoop a nice boost in scoring. There is a gaming cliche of "wanting to do more in your turn than allowed" and for me only this game justifies that feeling because of the ease of "seeing" the vps but also because of the mini races to get to them before being blocked off by opponents' camels (or because of the one vacant space between same colour camel rule). With only 2 camels to place in a turn and your opponents trying for the same goals gives this dry exercise some necessary tension, as does the countdown of the game end when a colour group of camels is used up. I think I prefer 2-3 players rather than more as it can get visually confusing and you are really stretch to try to achieve your little objectives. Not a big fan of open information games as I prefer a small element of secrecy and luck but here at least part of the scores become a secret stack, and the cute camels helps the theme making it alittle warmer than most cold abstracts.

I can't say enough good things about this game - utterly brilliant. One of the most elegant game designs of all time; it is just perfect, nothing more, nothing less. One of my all-time favorites. TtD is luck free and is a complete and perfect information game. You are the master of your destiny. Its rules are simple and straight forward, but it is always a nail-biter. Tense and highly tactical, it engrosses you to the very end. The variety of ways one can win victory points adds to the beauty of it. Infinite replayability value.

The theme is certainly dry, but that is not a detractor, at least for me. It is an abstract strategy game after all. The only negative thing I can say about TtD is that with 5 players there is less control than I would like.

All in all, a must own by gamers and non-gamers who enjoy light-middle weight strategy games.

Among Knizia's top 5 game designs (along with: Tigris & Euphrates, Amun-Re, Samurai, and Taj Mahal).

Great game.  My son likes the rules because they are simple, but the game is about as interesting and deep as one can expect in 45 minute multiplayer game.

I have FF version. Board quality is a bit iffy and bits a little too teensy, so this is what's holding it back a little for me in addition to the game being great but not as appealing as I hoped.

I can see some vague similarities to Go but  that's all.  The board isn't wide open like Go.  There are all these objectives spread all over the board and you have five different colors to keep track of and all camels have to be placed adjacent.  It's an awesome game but it's not Go.

Wonderfully elegant game with attractive components. The options are great at first (with little impact) and as play proceeds the options are reduced and the impact increases. This seems to help keep the pace up and reduce the AP. The end game condition is a great mechanism to allow the apparent followers to keep the apparent leaders from trying to grab too much less they are thwarted by their opponent ending the game.

 A tile laying game of sorts, except that the tiles are tiny colored plastic camels. You're trying to spread multiple caravans of different colors to encircle areas, grab watering holes, and connect to oases, while your opponents are all doing the same, with your different caravans of the same color being forbidden to touch. It's a really clustered board, and moves sorta slow and fast at the same time, AND I LOVE IT! Samurai and Ra are games I feel I don't have a great grasp on, with Samurai still in a nebulous state as regards my feelings towards it, and Colossal is simple and quick in a way that I'm not thrilled about, but this is like a tile-laying game that in a pattern forming/mathy sort of way tickles me just like Modern Art. The only problem with the game itself is that the camel colors are all soft pastels, and many of them can be confused with another color (there is a pastel green and a neon green camel color). 

Overall I think I might have to rank this game super high, maybe even downgrade Modern Art in comparison. This game (and my victory in it; winning games on my first play often is indicative of my Spirit Damon being by my side) is really just great and I might have to break my spending moratorium if it gets the new printing that is due sometime soon.

RATING: N/A
I'm going to start things off by saying I don't play games for the theme any more than I drink beer for the bubbles. I think theme is (at its best) a source for vocabulary in order to explain the rules, and that's pretty much it. I don't find theme immersive in the slightest, and I don't think that all games ought to engage some topic for educational purposes. They're certainly welcome to, and I don't think that they can't or shouldn't, but rather I don't think "thematic coherence" is a non-negotiable quality that all games ought to aspire to. Adding "theme" often means adding rules and complexity purely in service of some kind of watered-down RPG fix. I also find that as "Realism" increases, so too do the number of rules required to support it. 

So that Through the Desert is an abstract game is not a problem -- there's nothing inherently wrong with an abstract game. That often means that the Game Problem is distilled to its essence, there's nothing distracting about it, and people can get right to competing within the constraints of that Game Problem. Through the Desert is a fairly simple territorial game that sees players drawing from a common pool of player pieces. This is a cool game clock that can be manipulated, and I am pretty partial to games where tempo management is one of the chief problems players have to work out. The camel pieces are used to create long chains that connect oases, or section off areas, or help to gather point tokens. And that's really it. On your turn, place two camels of any color and they can be in service of several different scoring or blocking goals. 

Overall, my bias: some people game because they want a story -- I'll read a story if I want a story. I game because I want a play-like structure to share with someone else and compete over/within. My wife frequently calls this her favorite game, and that's lucky for me. It's a really enjoyable abstract.

I like the fact that there is no luck involved. If you lose its because the other players out-played you. I have the Fantasy Flight edition with the nice plastic bits. The colors are a bit garish, but the overall graphical presentation is great. Nice quick game that can be tought in 10 minutes and played in under an hour. I would put it up there with Carcassone and Settlers of catan as a great game to play with non-gamers.

Not sure how I like this one. I guess I like more decisive moves in games. I kind of feel this one creeps forward and doesn't really allow any clear game winning moves, just slow and steady points collecting. Doesn't really inspire me, but wouldn't normally turn down a game either.

I am somewhat ambivalent toward this game.  I've enjoyed the games I've played but was not blown away.  Ostensibly a tile laying game, but feels like a race game, as in who can get their caravans to the good spots first.  There are a bunch of different goals to race after.  A lot of the fun comes from trying to wisely choose which race to run, and which to abandon.

RATING: 8
Simple and intuitive. One qualm I have about this game is that it takes way too long to set up this game. It’s starting to get stale on me though (although that’s probably because I usually play it two-player); I find the scoring mechanisms are not as integrated as I would like them to be. Territory scoring is slightly too lucrative in relation to all the other scoring opportunities. This “complaint” of unbalanced scoring mechanisms is more noticeable in Stephenson’s Rocket.

I admit it, this was another BGG-induced buy.  But it's Knizia AND the pastel camels have gained enough fame that I had to have them.  It's true the game's a bit out of line with my tastes (being abstract strategy), but it has a good "look" too it.  It's quite clever, and is more "acceptable" to non-gamers who don't want to spend the next 4 hrs battling horrific monsters from other dimensions.  Add that it's easy to teach and relatively short and it becomes a solid 7 to me.

After one 2-player game: Ooooh!  Pink camels!  Ok, ignoring the pink camels, this game is great fun for two, and I expect it's an even better brain battle for three or more.  Play offensively, play defensively, or try to grab your own while ignoring the other player's gains, tough choices.  I did well on my first play, and I'll definitely play it again.  Still, I wouldn't quite put it into the all-time classic category just yet; I have to try it with more players first.

I’m not that big into tile laying games but Through the Desert is one of the better games using this mechanic. The claustrophobic board works well.

This is a super easy game to play filled with strategy.  The little detailed camels are some of the best components I&#039;ve seen in a game and make up for Fantasy Flight&#039;s usual poor die-cut quality.  However, my board was torn from the factory.  If I buy this game again, I&#039;ll buy the Kosmos edition.  The oasis markers are shaped like pools of water instead of just circles. I like this game best with two, maybe three.  With more the camels run out faster and you have to be very conservative with your plans of enclosing areas.

After playing this game the first time, I thought it was passable, but unexciting and mundane.

Recently I've played it a few more times, and I'm really starting to enjoy it more.  You really need to maximize your moves while always focusing on getting your majorities.  It seems like it'd be very difficult to win this game unless you are ahead or at least tied on colour majorities.

Simple, but competitive, area control game.  Fairly quick.  This is a good cross between a euro and an abstract.

Very nice game; played very quickly; easy to learn, but still allows for different strategies.
 
The only negative points: many small parts, which also require quite some preparation time; some camel colours are difficult to distinguish without very good lightening.

A charming little game that's much more cutthroat than it originally seems. A little bit like Go, with enough differences to make it a unique experience.

A lot of fun but sometimes too simple for it's own good. Initial placement of camels is very important and sometimes I wonder if I shouldn't just go strictly for watering holes.

I like the go-like feel.  Clever design by constraining placements to be adjacent to a previously laid camel speeds the game up and focuses the play.  It doesn't feel as heavy in play as one would expect, as mostly one is focussed on local races, with the overall shape of the game largely set by the initial placements and first few turns of the game.

a little fiddly (the scoring is a little fiddly), but a solid area control game.

RATING: 7.5
I appreciate ToD for it's accessibility for new and casual players while maintaining some good brain burn for the hard core. The blocking mechanics is solid and there are several layers of strategy to consider: 

do you mutually lock out high value water holes? do you focus on longest caravan? do you try to maximize your oasis connections? do you go for big enclosures? do you bum-rush a color when it's getting low? Lots of simple but relevant stuff to keep in mind.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Each player attempts to score the most points by snaking caravan routes through the desert, trying to reach oases and blocking off sections of the desert. Many people feel that it is reminiscent of Go.

Very pretty game and lots of fun.  Highly recommended!

RATING: 9
Great game - the rules are easily explained, but the game has a great deal of options during the course of play.  The best part, however, is that the choices are not overwhelming complex - pick the camels and place them.  Straightforward but engaging - recommended.

It's an abstract game with a very much tacked on theme.  No, you don't feel you're leading caravans as you're trying to control areas and grab victory points, but who cares?  It's good fun trying to block your opponents and race for the points while keeping an eye on whose train of each colour is longest.  It's got lovely components in the multi-colour camels and their riders, which are fab.  This plays very differently, but very well, with different numbers of players from 2 to 5.

Jogo complexo, muito colorido e relativamente rápido de aprender, que depois de jogado deixa a mesa muito bonita e apetite para jogá-lo novamente, até porque se joga uma partida num instante, cerca de 25 minutos. Forte candidato a ser a melhor obra de Knizia. Eu adoro-o e continuo a não compreender o porquê de o considerarem um jogo abstracto, pois na minha opinião é temático e bem temático!

GO WITH CANDY COLORED CAMELS - ANOTHER KNIZIA KLASSIC
Fun little game, wish the board would lay properly.  Have only played a few times so far, someone else always seems to finish a camel color (ending the game) while I'm still busy making plans.  Looking forward to hitting on a winning strategy.  Daughter (10) enjoys, son (7) a bit lukewarm.  Often criticized by the BGG cognescenti as very dry - I have no idea what they are talking about.

Similar to Breaking Away, my bad rating is based largely on the fact that every time I've played has been far too slow for a game with this much luck.  Though in appearance a luck-free game, everything depends on how other people prioritise their goals, and you have to get lucky in not butting-heads with another player.  Would be curious to see if a faster game of this would be more fun.

RATING: 7
(+) Achieves a successful abstract experience for five players.  
(+) Evokes the simple yet strategic elegance of Go and the concept of surrounding.  
(+) Lean, clever twists in the ruleset as is only achieveable by Dr. Knizia.  

(-) At full player it can be hard to plan long term strategy.  
(-) Abstract at heart and so lacks thematic impact.  
(-) Pastel colors are somewhat challenging to distinguish.

RATING: 7
I mostly play this with my daughters.  Not as fun as I had hoped given the reviews, but still quite good.  Good looking bits for a game that is highly abstract.  My suspicion is that it could be quite good with the right group due to agonizing decisions and lots of opportunities to cut one another off.  Could be construed as similar to TtR in that respect, with unlimited chances to cut people off.

Played quite a bit with my brother now - definitely more fun than I first thought with the right opponent(s).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Exciting at first, then sort of dull. Take Go, remove the ability to play anywhere, thus limiting the full-board strategy to the initial placement phase. Add some Twixt-ish connection issues. Make it multiplayer. 

It's sort of Go with the calculative elements removed. I always talk about how I love games for strategic depth, not analytive rigor, but this game seems sort of stripped down to pure decisions of long-term scoring. No tough fighting, only choices.

Feels like castrated Go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A lot of fun :) i'm not normally a big fan of open information games but i really like this one, in part i think because of the infintire variety of water hole and oasis placement. works well for any number and the turn angst is sublime. 

Calculation Factor: present but not overwhelming and can largely be ignored by newer players and just played for the fun it is.

Pain Factor: 2 camels IS NOT ENOUGH!!!

Git Factor: oh yes :)

RECOMMENDATIONS:

IF YOU LIKE THIS TRY: tigris&euphrates - heavier and with hidden info but as enjoyable
                      hacienda - similar animal chain theme but more convoluted, less angst but with hidden info

I really like this game. It's fast, it's fun, and it's full of options. It has a surprising amount of depth as well. To all people who are considering games, please don't underestimate how fast this game plays: it is a significant point in favor of a game that is also deep enough for strategically-minded players.

Quite a bit of strategy, no luck at all, but still has an excellent "fun factor".  Despite the depth of strategy involved, it's easy to learn.  The desert theme fits the game very well.  The only potential negative is for some players to feel like others are "ganging up on them".  In reality, it doesn't work that way, but in this game, that perception is possible.

--02Sept2004-- Very nice game with a few vaguely Go-like overtones.  I'd guess it'll need three or four more plays before I've got a reasonable feel for a reasonable selection of the possible strategies.
--27Oct2004-- Interesting:  the "Go-like" hypothesis has lead me astray in my last couple games!  The game is so short that the end condition (game ends when one colour of camels has been exhausted) strongly affects one's planning.  I found myself making plays so that I could surround a substantial region - but had the game end before the  inevitable surround actually occurred.

Very cool and accessible area-control game with multiple paths to victory. I love the lack of randomness with this one. It feels like there are too many bits to set up for the type of experience the game delivers. I like to bring it out once in a while, but despite its short playing time, it doesn't give me that "one more time" feeling.

Update:

Been playing this a lot more with kids and light gamers and have been enjoying i immensely. Lots of table talk and cursing (in a polite way), sees everyone having a good time. It's fast to teach and very easy to play, but with good little choices throughout. Best of all for new gamers or as an after dinner filler - it's over in about 20-30 minutes.

One of the best gateway games out there.

-----------
Kind of reminds me of Samurai light. Some people who don't like Samurai do seem to like this - I don't really get why, but that's my observation. It's so quick and light that I don't mind it, but it doesn't blow me away - probably because the choices seem so one dimensional - place camels, place camels...

This is Knizia's [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/188]Go[/url][/i] variant and a very analytical game.  Besides area control, you get points for reaching certain places in the board (water and oasis) and for having the longest caravan of one or more of the five different colors. The color selection of the pieces, that look like candy, just hurts your eyes and your brain, but is nice if you are not playing the game.

I enjoy abstract games where the turns are quick and smooth, but the strategy is deep, so I like Through the Desert. It reminds me of Hey That's My Fish and Kingdom Builder, both of which I enjoy. The scoring is straightforward, and I feel like this would be a game that both newcomers and more-seasoned players would enjoy.

This one is an anomaly for me.  Lots of ways to score points, multiple paths to victory and you always want to do more than you are able to.  All things I love about my favorite games.  So, why isn't this game any fun?  Okay, that's a bit of an overstatement.  But, it lacks a fun factor for me that other (possibly inferior) games have.  That said, I can't say that I mind playing it - it's just more of an exercise than a rollicking good time.

This game is okay if you're looking for a very quick, short game that doesn't require too much thinking. I feel that this game would be more suited for children than for adult gamers. If you are looking for a game to play with your family, this may be an okay one to choose. But overall, I don't find much here that is challenging or inspiring... maybe it's because there just isn't that much variety in this game. There's just not too many different choices you can make on any given turn. Also, one of the REAL problems with this game is the COLOR SCHEME used for the game -- all the pastel colors blend into each other during the game, so it's extremely difficult to tell one player's pieces from the next.

My girlfriend complains that this is 'yet another' game I've forced her to play that requires you to make great opening moves or suffer the consequences. There is some truth to that, poor initial placement of your caravan leaders can give you trouble later on. It's also the kind of game where you can suffer from analysis paralysis if you let it ... but you don't have to let it. Each turn you place two camels, either extending two caravans by one camel each, or extending one caravan by two camels. I like that there are multiple ways of scoring. There's a bit of a Go homage here, in that contiguous camels of the same color belong to a single caravan, and encircling or bordering off terrain gets you extra points. I like the uncertainty of the end game, but with a large number of players, I imagine that uncertainty would be very high. I look forward to another playing now that I understand the rules.

Through the Desert is a game that has gone over well as a first introduction. The theme may be pasted on, but it's pasted on with great big globs of confectionary spun sugars. The pretty pastel camels, simple rules, short player turns and an immediate cutthroat nature seem to appeal fairly broadly. There's something about friendly but very direct competition that brings a gleeful gleam into the eye of otherwise sweet and non-aggressive people....

Another elegant design by Knizia (I gave Taj Mahal high marks). Plenty of things you want to do, and not enough actions to do them all. I like this best 2-player.

I find it's a pretty good 'gateway game', and I've been teaching it to my friends who've only played Ticket to Ride.

I just bumped down my rating because I never play TtD and never feel like playing it anymore. May have to do with Ludagora.net on which I played a lot for a while.

I'm a huge Knizia fan as well as liking abstract strategy games.  I had been wanting to play this one for a long time.  When I finally got to play, it was everything I expected.  I finally was able to track down a copy of my own.  I love the multitude of decisions that must be made on nearly every turn.  There is so much you want to do, but what do you pursue.  And what do you think your opponents will do?  How do you adapt when you miss one opportunity trying to convert another?  I know I have a winner when my wife asks me to get a copy for us :)

Abstract and very well made. Nothing really special though, imho. 

Features that I don't like are that each player pretty much takes non-interactive sequential turns. When other people think, you have to sit there and not do much.

Hard to say after first play - I like it, but would need to play more. The biggest attraction is of course spatial play, but there's really so many things going on simultaneously and fast - immediate goals, medium and long term goals. Seems more tactical than Kingdom Builder and I couldn't really say it's an elegant game (Kosmos edition surely looks more elegant than anything Queen games can put together) - there's a ton of pieces and stuff.

A lovely game, lightly like Go in the five player version, more so in three or two player versions.

There are multiple paths to victory, as is typical in Knizia games, and this just feels RIGHT.

Unfortunately, it also lacks some pizazz, and doesn't come out often. People usually enjoy other games,as this is perceived to not have much depth. I believe this is not true. The game might have been helped (some would say harmed) with another mechanic, such as variable powers or hidden cards.

This is great fun if you enjoy playing perfect-information abstracts. Each player plays down two camels a turn to add on to existing caravans in a bid to reach oases or to cordon off an area of the board. The rules are dead simple, yet the gameplay has a lot of depth.

Unfortunately, the people I played with don't enjoy abstracts. Even I found it a little too dry and eventually traded it away.

2006: 7. Initially loved this game - it was my first *real* board game purchase when I got into the hobby! - but got tiring with more plays.  Easy to learn, great presentation, but eventually becomes less-entertaining to non-gamers because there are no surprises.  Everyone's strategy is more or less clear on the board, there's nothing to hide or be sneaky about.  Great design, but get Samurai instead.

UPDATE 2014-02: 8. Brought this out to try with my non-gamer dad and step-mom, and they both really loved it! Attractive components and simple gameplay, very little hidden information. Both of them were making cutthroat competitive moves in only their second game. And enough time has gone by for the game to feel fresh again to me. Upgraded to an 8.

Interesting. I enjoy the game a lot, but especially with two player games it can suffer from an imbalance of skill. There is no luck, and no hidden information. So with two players of uneven skill, the winner swiftly becomes apparent. Then the game becomes a chore, as the outcome is already decided. If this happens often enough between two opponents, the game loses its luster. This is true, to a lesser extent, with 3 and 4 players. I like the game nevertheless. I like the theme, even though it is criticized as being "dry". I enjoy the mechanics, which are mildly remiscent of Go and Twixt (for me, anyway).A warning though - this is not a gateway game, in my opinion. At least I have had ZERO luck with it as such. See, I've only listed two plays. I've exposed it to 4 different people, and talked to others about their experiences playing it. Same result - not a successful gateway game, that is, not unless a person is already a very gamer's-gamer sort of person.I think if you like some of Knizia's other designs, DdW is really worth a shot, however. You might really love it.

Egyszerű szabályok, gyors játék, mégis bőven van min gondolkodni a játék alatt. A játékosok karavánutakat építenek a négy színből. Minél nagyobb, minél több értékes helyet elérőt és jó esetben minél nagyobb területet lekerekítőt. Jó játék az Át a sivatagon, megfelelő a doboz nagysága is, de a színeket jobban végiggondolhatták volna a tervezők.

Simple and elegant.  Plays well, I just don't know how much fun I have at this game.  Never really satisfies.  Two player is terrible.  But I gotta say the pieces are great!

UPDATE: After I traded this away I never had the desire to play this again.  Years later tried it on for size to see if my opinion had changed.  Nope still find it dull.  I feel like the winner is determined by the group, whoever isn't seen as the biggest threat is allowed more leeway to win.  I'm not sure how good you can be at the game, more how well you can disuade other people from thinking that you have potential.  There are only a finite number of turns and people will want to block and further their position.  The game is build to facilitate those decisions, but ultimately the freedom it gives created a system entirely determined from the metagame.  I just can't get excited.

Theme and components really make the difference here; if this were played with colored chips on a plain board, I for one wouldn&#039;t have given it a second glance. It works reasonably well, but given the choice I would rather play Samurai.

RATING: 7
I've only played two-player and we left all the camels in the first two times so we screwed it up. The third time we played the game was much more tight (obviously) and tense. I could see liking this with three, maybe four, but I think with five I might feel too frustrated with both waiting for my turn and for the changes on the board between turns.

Once past the pieces, the designers craft comes through.  Comparing to its grandpa "The Game of Y", it sure is easier to pull those non-abstract folks in for a play.  The economic teaser is just enough to pull in the accountant types and the race and crowded competition works for just about everyone else.

Played with my wife last night and wasn't blown away. I have heard very good things about this game and did enjoy it, but something was missing for me. To be honest, the colour palette of the camels is just awful. They should have gone with Middle Eastern palette (dark reds, browns) vs. pastels. Want to give another go with more players.

UPDATE: 3/3 Better with 4 people no doubt. Would like to play again. Pastel colours though still bother me. Ug...lee.

A lot more fun than I expected. I feared it would be too dry and strict, but with five players there was loads of stuff to do and many great srewage opportunities. The game seems to have a lot of scoring options, which is a feature that usually works great for me.

Looks great, easy and generally fun to play.  But not simple to win, as there are a number of strategy options and the other player(s) to monitor.  Best for 2 or 3 players in my opinion.  Great little camels and palm trees.  Both my wife and I enjoy it (which is not as true with PanzerBlitz, for example), but the original shine has worn off a bit over time.  Still recommended though.

Though Tigris & Euphrates is my favourite, I like every game in Knizia's tile-laying trilogy, but I'm not sure whether I prefer this over Samurai. Through the Desert is probably less easily solved, which is good, and it scales very well.  I also like the tempo management involved with the decision of which colour camels to take.  It's just a bit unsatisfying in the end.  It might be the length.

Another one of our very early purchases that I hadn't played in several years. Finally played it 8/09 online (Ludagora.net).

It's good, I suppose. But to me it's yet another abstract game that I'm not very good at playing!

--- Summary ---
Seed the board with bonus oasis chips (value 1-3), and trees. Players take turns placing a camel (with their color rider) in each of the 5 colors. Then rotate taking turns placing any 2 camels to extend your camel lines; game ends when any color camel is depleted. If you place camel onto oasis chip, take it. At end of game, score VP for chips collected, areas (including oasis chips) surrounded by your camel lines, and bonuses for longest camel line of each color. Most VP wins.

One of the first Eurogames I bought in an order from Funagain.  I always liked it, how can you not like pastel camels, but it's too abstract to rank as one of my favorites.  I haven't played it in years though, so it's about time we dust it off!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I simply don't like abstract games.  There are a lot of choices and different ways to score and plan out your turns in this.  There are points for oasis', watering holes, and sectioning off parts of the map as well as opportunity to block your opponent and set the pace of the game.  These are a lot of decisions and if you devote the time to it you can get a lot of value out of this game.

I just don't like it enough to give it more than a single play unless someone really wants to play this.  I felt like the two-player game was just kind of uninteresting.  The 3- and 4-player games were increasingly more chaotic and still kind of uninteresting.  Abstracts just aren't for me, no matter how well designed it seems.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It took me a while to try this game because the analogy to GO scared me away; don't make that mistake!  The only thing GO-like is the ability to surround an area for points, but there are 3 other ways to get points so this makes for plenty of choices.  The rules are simplicity itself, while the play is quite engaging, sucking you into the desert like a drop of water.

RATING: 8
I own the original German edition, "Durch Die Wuste" (the literal translation of which is "You're a two-hump chump and your momma has camel toe"), .  The English-language edition is "Through The Desert", not "Through The Dessert".  Also, typing up game reviews after several pints of beer is not recommended.  So let's start with those pastel-coloured camels.  A lot of people talk about how "cute" they are.  I say, how about normal-coloured camels with different-coloured saddles and trappings?  I don't need camels that look like they would taste like those minty-chocolate candies my grandparents used to have in their candy bowl.  In fact, I can vouch for the fact that they don't taste very good at all.  So now that the camels are taken care of, let me just say that this is actually a very enjoyable game.  It is also very simple to learn, and is one of my favourite games to teach to board game neophytes.  While I would like to be laying more than two camels at once (not in THAT way, pervert), it does, in typical Knizia style, add to a lot of the tension of the game.  In fact, there's enough going on here to keep my A.D.D. personality interested.  And speaking of staying interested, it's always entertaining to go back and read my own reviews after the beers wear off.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

I don't mind abstract strategy games (heck, I love chess) but this one just doesn't do much for me.  It's not a terrible game, and I can see why some people love it, it just didn't engage me the way other abstract strategy games I like have.  I don't know why this is the case.  One problem is the game seems to end very quickly b/c there always seems to be a favorite camel color that runs out fast.  Thus it feels like you don't make much progress towards any kind of "master strategy" before the game's over.

[Kosmos 'Durch die Wuste' 1998 edition] {Desert; connection; optimal 4-6p} A very good family abstract game. There aren't many good abstract games that can support up to 6p; if you like large-group abstract games, you should get a copy.

TtD is easy to learn and master. They won't lose their mind in the play for the simple rules and simple concept. Besides, attractiveness of the camels helps a lot.

There are many decisions in TtD. Players should to decide if they should attack/defend for each caravan, which chips to get, which longest caravan to make, etc. However, the decision is fairly easy to make because it's not very difficult to visualize 2 or 3 steps in advance. The stage of positioning riders is very important. Don't place camel riders mindlessly.

[Rule] I usually play TtD with the Kosmos rules.

Durch die Wüste is probably my top-rated Knizia game. I like the multi-player Go-like approach - and the ultra-fast turns. You pick a camel, you place a camel, and sometimes you collect a chit. That's it.
During play you always have to keep all the different victory point possibilities in mind.
Elegant and brillant design.

Dio Knizijine 'tile placement trilogije'. Opsežniji 'Hey That's My Fish', sa kompletnom informacijom i  malenim brojem pravila, ali sa nešto više opcija kako se popesti preko ramena svojih bližnjih. U ovoj igri nema noža u leđa jer se nož zabija i prije nego se i okreneš. Utrka do bunara, utrka do oaza, zagrađivanje pustinje, imanje najvećeg krda, sve nosi bodove. Sve se može, no pitanje je kojim redom a tamo gdje jedan zakasni, drugi jedva čeka da požuri.
Jednako dobra (premda različita) u 2, 3, 4 ili 5.

tl;dr: shows how good Reiner used to be

Simple rules, streamlined game play and interesting choices. These days Reiner seems to limit himself to the first 2, but when he made this game he remembered to put in the third, most important, ingredient.
I'm not going to say this is a sublime game or my favorite of his, but this clearly shows just how elegant and effective his designs from this period used to be.
So yeah, this is a very good design that hits a balance that few games do. I do enjoy playing it, but it is a bit one dimensional. For me Ticket to Ride is a game that is very close in it's simplicity but just a bit more fun than this one. Still, this one is certainly worth playing.

While the wife and I will play this game 2 player we have other favorites for a two player game, and this game has come out less.

[gameid=503] sees us taking on the mighty desert, nomads trying to survive in the wasteland - scoring points as we go along.

The game has some really cool camels and a theme that does the job, although it could be placed anywhere really. Still, glow-in-the-dark camels, that is pretty nifty.

Unfortunately the game is not so cool. Sure it is a [person=2] game and by some considered a classic, but it certainly didn't fall within our sphere of interest. It involves connecting oases, cutting off your opposing nomads or avoid being cut off.

I know the game by nature is an abstract, which rarely sits well with us, and area control is not a strong suit either. The game works by those standards, sure. Our games felt tense, despite, and you had to keep an eye on every finger - or rather camel.

That said, it will never be a favourite and has been traded off. The mechanics, theme and all-round gameplay just felt lacking.

07 APR 2009 - Played @ GameStorm 11 - I had really been wanting to play this. It was a little different than I thought. We were playing quickly so I didn't make the best decisions being my first time playing. I love the camels (pastels are fine for me) and palm trees. I see lots of potential for strategies and I'm sure it changes with varying numbers of players (we played 4). Still want to get it, but not quite as high on my list as some other games.

Also, every time I get a friend to play it, my wife makes fun of the gay-colored camels (in her defense, I agree that the camels could be a bit more conservatively-colored.

Interesting. The basic goal is to surround territory in a way that is reminiscent of Go. That said, this is not Go-lite.

RATING: 8
Really great game. Deceptively simple to learn but very deep... even though every turn is just placing two camels, the game has a dramatic progression, with early turns free and full of possibility and later turns incredibly tense. Scales nicely as well.

The one knock against this game is that with new players the initial camel placement is weird, as without any game play under their belts the new players can make serious errors.

After owning this game for a year, I finally got it out and played with a group of friends. I am now kicking myself for not doing so earlier.

After three plays, I know that this one will be back to the table again very soon.

Four player is chaotic and fun, but ultimately lacks a bit of direction and tension and my rating was going to slip a bit until I discovered two player, which has me craving playing it on a regular basis.

It's a very good "little" abstract game that plays nice and quick.  Highly tactical (after some strategic initial placements) and much more cut-throat than the pastel-coloured camels would have one believe. And an abstract game that can accommodate more than 2 players is always welcome. 

UPDATE 1: It was never hitting the table so I traded it away.

UPDATE 2: I tried it again at Snakes & Lattes in Toronto and wish I still had my copy.

Well, what could you expect from a desert game rather more than a dry game? It is easy to grab though. And nice enough for what it is. Lack of choice is compensated by the fast pace of the game.

iOS version.  This is a great area control game with an excellent set of different scoring conditions that lead to interesting choices.  I have played it quite a bit and like it very much.  My only complaint is it would do better with a more variable board, as it gets very samey after awhile. I have heard a lot about how beautiful the components are and I like the theme, but I am not hopeful of ever seeing a physical copy of this game.

Set-up time is the biggest detractor for this abstract.  With only two camel placements per turn, there are always too many options to choose from, which makes for tense decisions.

First impression:
A classic luckfree euro with a very boring theme (ok, you might like creating abstract caravan lines in the desert - I don't), but also with decent player interaction. I usually like such games.

Still, my eyes bleed every time I look at the camels + I need someone immediately to remind me their colors so I can actually play it. 
"I need two pink camels to expand my caravan. Not these damn it, these are light purple!"

Ok maybe it's my bad color lore, or my taste is opposite to that of the designers. But I still get the feeling that this game was designed to appeal to "little girls" and "homos." based on some absurb stereotype guide or whatever.
Just think about it: Pink, Purple, Cyan, Turquoise and Light Somon.
Please someone shoot those camels out of their misery!

If you like the sound of a game where you make camel trains through the desert in order to claim points and cordon off areas for extra points before your opponent can do the same, then this game is for you. There's not much more to it than that. Traded in Maths Trade January 2011.

Pastel Camels.  I kind of wish it was called Through the Dessert so I could eat them.  Yummy.  Multiple paths to victory, good player interaction.  Quick game to boot.  Can't go wrong with this one.  Its everything I hoped Samurai would be the first time I played, I just hope it has Samurai's addictive quality.  I'm bad at this game.  Thats okay however, for the decisions are fun.  

The only bummer this game has for me is the only goal is to get points.  You aren't trying to achieve an objective that scores you points, you are just trying to score points efficiently.  Hitting a tree doesn't quite feel like an objective for me.  I don't think I'm doing a good job of describing what I mean... so this will probably get updated later.

This is an excellent 2-player game that is very deep, despite the pastel colors and relatively short playing time.  The four different ways to score (i.e., watering holes, oasis, largest caravans, enclosures) significantly increase replayability.  There is essentially no luck involved in this game, which makes it a great battle of wits.  Unfortunately the game doesn't work very well with 4 or 5 players because the board is simply too hectic and cluttered.

After 7 games as a two player, this really is an good game.  Unlike the other in my collection, there are more options to finish and score in the game. You can enclose areas, place a camel in your caravan adjacent an oasis, score from watering holes and even force the game to finish early (while you are winning).

If I am brutally honest this stayed in the bottom of the draw for a couple of months because I never found the interest to plod through such a verbose description of the rules.  The truth is though, the rules are easy, I really don't think they need such elaboration.

Update.
As a three player game is good fun, but it seems to retain more of its tactical play than some other games.

Through the Desert is an older classic. I didn't start gaming until well after it was released. And while I know people who own it, it's never been a hot game that people have pushed to play. I've always wanted to try it, but in a vague sort of way.

In the game, there are five colors of camels. Each player has a rider for each color (for some player counts this isn't true I think). The board is seeded with watering holes (point tiles) and oases (which you connect to for points). Players take turns seeding the board with their riders (which can't be placed adjacent to an oasis or any other player's piece). Once everyone has done their initial placement the regular game starts.

On a player's turn they place two camels on the board. The must place a camel adjacent to either their rider of the same color, or to a camel of the same color that forms a continuous chain of that color camel back to their rider. One player's chain of a color can never become adjacent to another player's chain of the same color (there can never be any ambiguity about whose chain of camels it is). The game ends when any one color of camels has been completely placed on the board.


If a player places a camel on a watering hole, they take that tile (1, 2 or 3 points). If they achieve adjacency to an oasis they get a 5 point tile (only the first instance of that player's chain being adjacent to a particular oasis counts). And if they section off an area where the boundaries of the area are only either the edges of the board and/or that player's color (and no other player's pieces are interior to that area) then they collect all the watering hole tokens in that area and each spot in that area will be a point for them at game end. Additionally, the player who has the longest chain of camels for a color will get the 10 point bonus for that color.

This game is very much a tactical area control game. I've recently discovered that I enjoy some older classic games that have a similar area control aspect, like Java and Mexica. This game hits many of the same notes for me. The rules are very simple but there's a lot to consider on your turn. I really enjoyed this one a lot.

I found this game to be superior in almost every way to [thing=8203][/thing]: there are more ways to score, thus, more things to be done, while the game is still easy to teach and to play. The play do last more (around 40 minutes), however, this is expected for a richer game. And also both share the same bad part: the ratio of time from set up to playing is far from great.

As for taste, [thing=503][/thing] almost fired [thing=8203][/thing], but this one will still have its place, since way more players in my group has it and also it is more portable (a big advantage when considering games to take to a game night), lighter and plays faster - so still has its niche.

The gameplay is pretty straightforward: first, every player will put one camel of his at a time. There are three rules for this placement: 1) you can't put a camel adjacent of other player's camel; 2) you can't put a camel adjacent of an oasis; 3) you can't put a camel above a score token. All other places are fine - you can put on the edge of the board, in the middle, whatever.

In his turn the player takes two camels (from different colors or the same) and puts then in the board, continuing a line of camels. If the camel is put above a points token or adjacent to an oasis, the player gains points. More points come if the player completely surround an area (1 point per hex in the area) with a single color of camels (and without any camels inside the area, even of the same player) and by having the biggest amount of camels of a color (10 points for each color). Camels of the same color cannot touch each other - there must be at least one hex of distance between them (and this can be use in a lot of ways to prevent other players to going some place); camels of different colors can be next to each other, but only one camel can be in every hex. And that is it for rules! 

Therefore, you will dispute for point tokens on the board, for spots adjacent of oasis, for the biggest amount of camels of each color and will try to close off areas to score even more points. The game ends as soon as a color of camels ends. The player with the most points wins!

So, [thing=503][/thing] has more to be done, but is still easy to learn and teach: take two camels, put them in the board. Done! Also, the board looks beautiful by the game end and the camels look just like candy!

RATING: 7
Route-building game where each player has five routes. There are four ways for a route to score. I'm pretty sure Tom Vasel likes it because there are usually many things you can do on a given turn. That's less good for me, though it is helped by the fact that you can categorize your options according to which of your five routes would be expanded to accomplish them.

Due to the spatial nature of the game it is very difficult to calculate point deltas. I like this because it means I must play by gut, but I do kind of wonder whether it's less gut and more tunnel vision; i.e., if I'm simply ignoring some factors.

There's some not-so-good multiplayer conflict stuff of the "I can thwart him but it won't help me" sort.

A major reason I avoided this game for so long was that I didn't like the idea of the initial setup phase, a lengthy placement of initial camels where you can probably throw away a win if you do it badly. The strategy here is interesting to me though.

RATING: 8.5
I had put off buying this game for a long time because of the abstract nature (no luck involved). I finally got it based on several recommendations, and I am very pleased. Typically I shy away from perfect information games, but this works very well and doesn't cause too much stress. The best part is that the game is fairly light and doesn't take very long to finish - I'm thinking 30 minutes for 2P and 45-50 minutes for 4P. The components are nice (although the board is no Days of Wonder board), especially the camel bits of renown. It seems that the winner is usually not determined until the counting of the scoring markers, which I like. Knizia has a masterpiece here. It does well what it was designed to do. 

I continue to enjoy this game and find that I'm always in the mood to play it. Probably my favorite Knizia game.

I am a massive fan of Go, and I suppose the two games are similar in some ways. But go is so much more complex and strategical and yadda yadda yadda. In some ways the similarities turn me off this game, just because I prefer go, and instead of playing this game I could just play go...I also don't particularly like the theme and the gameplay in general. But hey, thats just me.

great game! I've played it a 2-player and 3-player game, I'd like to try it with more sometime -- I love the combination of points for area-encirclement(vaguely go-like), with points for connecting to specific locations  and getting the longest caravan (these last two are reminiscent of things like ticket to ride).


The pastel camels are adorable, but I'm a little color blind and find some of the colors hard to tell apart; we've used a sharpie to mark some of them, which helps, but mars their beauty.

From the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels! The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.
In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.
Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.

RATING: 8
Great fun as a five player game, as you have to be  canny about how to build your links and score your points with four other minds competing.  As the player counts gets lower, I find that  the game becomes more dry and abstract.

There are very few games as good as this.  See my review.  Strategy, tactics, speculation, all with just placing 2 camels per turn.  Wonderful and elegant in less than 45 minutes, even with deep thinking experienced players.  So much game.  Perfect game. Best with three.

Sometimes we giggle, scream and protest all the way through, other times it's 20 minutes of deep silence.  Multiple strategies are available: I've won with no territory captured, aiming only to make long caravans and oasis connections; but I've also been trounced doing so.  I've played antagonistically and passively, and won and lost both ways.  Rich, deep, fun, and quick.  

In the first 4 days we owned this we played it more than the game we traded for it, which we'd had for eight months.

I love how there are so many different options that you really have to pick and choose. Even the slightest randomization of watering holes and palm trees, along with different leader placements each game, give this wonder a vast amount of replayability. Like a more approachable version of Go, with an excellent balance of short-term tactics (palm trees, watering hole markers) and long term goals (areas, caravan bonuses). A good game with 3 or 4, but phenomenal with 2. One of the best 2 player games around.

Every turn, it feels like you have to make a critical decision, which normally indicates a good game, but I have a few issues with it.

1. I am always frustrated that my attempts to look ahead never work out.  "Pick a strategy and stick with it" philosophy will kill you.
2. The game ends a little too early... momentum hasn't had time to settle with any player.
3. It's too easy to develop tunnel vision.  You have to watch every aspect of the game.  Once players figure this out, every turns takes an eternity.
4. A player who is perceived as winning has zero chance.  Mob mentality rules.

All my friends love this game, but after many plays I still haven't warmed up to it.

The theme fits the game. You are building a caravan train across the desert, connecting oases and waterholes. The winner supplies the most area with their train, and links the most water sources.

The territorial aspect of the game initially didn't appeal to me, nor did the glacial pace of the progress (two camels at a time, usually placed on different trains, makes for a long development time, even though the turns are short), but the challenge of walling off certain areas of the board while also going for the oases makes the game very interesting.  It's very easy to play one game after another, and it challenges you to make some tough decisions each turn.

4 plays: 3 players

RATING: N/A
Played 5 player once and absolutely HATED it. There were always too many things I needed to do and only two actions to use. I'd like to give it another try, though, as I suspect part of my frustration was with the folks I was playing with at the time and this is supposed to be a great game so it deserves at least a second chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like that there are several ways to achieve victory. Most turns you'd like to add 4 or 5 camels to the board, but you can only add 2. The quick game play is a plus for when you don't want to invest a lot of time in a game but still get some good decision-making.

After Acquire, this game was my first "serious" eurogame.  More than Acquire, this game defined for me the sense of wonder of great board games.

This is one of Knizia's better abstract strategy games. However, it just didn't grab me, as I found it flat and unengaging. I'd actually rather play Einfach Genial; at least there, there's no pretense to an actual theme and the playing time is much shorter.

RATING: N/A
From the award-winning game designer Reiner Knizia comes a game of strategy, patience, and cool plastic camels! The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.
\13\\13\
In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.
Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.

Finnish FFG silver line edition with four plastic poster hangers keeping the stupid warping board flat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Extremely tense game and very meaty; it packs more tension into a one hour game than most "epic" games I've played. I like the multiple paths to victory that the various ways to score offer, and how highly interactive it is. There are two minor, related issues that keep me from rating it more highly: it's extremely difficult to recover from poor initial placement, and this therefore gives this a much worse kingmaker problem than many games if you're playing with more than 2. On the other hand, you could say the same thing about Settlers, and this plays in half the time, so it's not nearly as frustrating.

RATING: 7
This is a pretty standard Knizia game: a sedate thinking exercise with little to no excitement.  This one doesn't require as much brain power as some of his others, making it a nice filler.

But did they have to pick that god-awful color scheme for the camels?

Played solely with one or two opponents, but I'm not sure I'd ever want to try a four- or five-player game because the game is so sweet with just 2 or 3. Lots of tension and second-guessing what the opponent will play if I play *this* camel *here*, and so forth. The best moment comes when you place a camel that will allow you to seal off a huge area, an area the opponent could have split in half if only she'd seen the threat earlier!

I love the candy camels,  and the board is nice.  Would have preferred that they make the board double-sided to remove the unsightly line.  Water holes are all the same size, and all the chits are punched out from solid linen-textured cardboard.

I love the way that it has no luck,  but lots of nail-biting decisions.  Must get more people to play this with me...

El juego es entretenido y con bastante estrategia ya que tienes diferentes opciones y te estrujas los sesos para elegir la correcta en cada turno.

I hesitated a long time to buy this one. Don't make the same mistake I did. To quote Fawkes: [i]Very simple mechanisms, no luck, very tough decisions, huge turn angst and concepts that are easy to grasp... all in a fun 30-minute game.[/i]
Don't be scared away by the Go comparisons. This is accessible game for gamers and non-gamers. Although for some, this game may be a bit dry (but I don't mind). For me, this is a candidate for a 10. UPDATE: Played a 4 player game for the first time (2P so far). It just affirms my 9. UPDATE: Playing it more, and for me this is a 10.

First, the components: camels are wonderful, beduins even more, i adore their feet that lock into the saddles. But the colors are horrible, hardly distinguishble and they cause some problems during playing. The leaves of the palms do not stick on their trunks. The board can't be made to stay flat. Setup and tear down times a bit too long. Rules for starting are too long.
A part from these minor (but numerous) complaints, i like this game very much for the wonderful sensation of "so much to do, so short time to do it" that you constantly have. Loads of hard decisions on what to focus on, how to block opponents, how to reach that last oasis. It's a great game with just some small production mistakes.

An outstanding game. a simple concept and a deep gaming that doesn't feel dry. 
None of the various scoring traits (oasis, water pits, area enclosure, longest caravans) seems overpowered or useless. Well balanced, works great for 2 and 3, haven't played it with more players as of yet.

RATING: 5
Abstracts are not my favorite. Through the Desert is very clearly an abstract, however, it was somewhat interesting to play and pretty snappy after I was taught the rules. The teacher of this game said that detractors of this game always point to the necessity of a good starting position and how the rest of the game really just plays out from there. I’ve only played once, but I think I see where they’re coming from.

I’d play this again, but I’d prefer playing most other games.

My first modern/euro board game (thanks lords_diakonos!) that plays well with my young family, including my 6 year old.  I was a little disappointed with the build quality (why are the palm trees made of two pieces of plastic?) and scale of the camels, but the game play is great.  If they were to come out with a "deluxe" or "10 year anniversary" edition that scaled the bits and board up even 5%, I'd buy it and definitely give the game a 9 or 10.

Ah, my favorite Knizia. I don't play it as often as I used to, but I sometimes still pull it out if people are willing to give it a try. Just as in Lost Cities, it's all about timing. You can find the optimal strategy after a dozen or so plays, but I prefer this game over LC because the luck factor is considerably lower.

Very plain kind of abstract game, but I liked the choices and how they evolved over the game (even though I got stomped!).

An area majority game where you're sort of defining your area as you go, as well as blocking other players and trying to reach immediate point-scoring opportunities.

I'd probably play differently next time, but I found it easy to understand and relatively quick to play.

The different scoring methods provide substantial tension to your decisions. Not too many rules to remember but good replay and fun. One of my favorite abstracts.

Update: I have not played in some time. I was tempted to drop this down from a 9 but after a couple replays I am letting it stand. It just feels really well balanced and seems to work with different number of players equally well as well as working with players of different skill levels well. It is not the best game ever but I am hard pressed to find any flaws in its design. One of RKs best designs.

Simple rules, fun and quick gameplay. A bit slow at the start when you're setting up your camel leaders, but after that it plays very quickly and can sometimes be over before you expected -- especially if someone decides their position isn't going to get any better and hurries to finish off one colour of camels.

Strategy can become quite complex, with various options for scoring points and manipulating the game state. But despite a lot of good points, it's not the most exciting game. I like it a lot, but can't get enthused about it.

Simpático y agradable, me gusta tenerlo cerca por darme siempre un gran resultado con no jugones, supongo que por ser una mezcla entre simplicidad y profundidad.

Los colores del juego pueden abrumar y más si se juega a altas horas.

De 2 a 5 jugadores, he de decir que escala perfectamente a todo el rango de jugadores.

Wonderful components, clever mechanics, and easy to teach rules. The gameplay is fast, the decisions are agonizing, and it holds incredibly high replay value. I don't like the pastel colors selected for the US version, but that's the only quibble.

There's plenty of room for both strategy and tactics while still feeling light enough that even kids enjoy the game. The pacing mechanic is great too, where you can drive towards endgame by using up a color of camels.

I just don't want to return to the game.

While a lot of people feel this is a Go variant... I think the decisions feel a lot more like playing hex... so its a variant of a go variant I guess :D

The starting positions are pretty important, but once you get past that bit of learning curve its easy to set yourself up for success.  I like gathering point chips, I like connecting oasises, I like competing for longest camel train and getting in my opponents way.  But as I've played more Knizia games with interesting scoring twists and deeper decisions despite equally simple rules this one has gotten less and less play and really isn't something I would reach for over a handful of other similar games in my collection (Taluva, Samurai, Pompeii, Ingenious, Hey That's my Fish!). Bummer to fall out of love with a game but I'd still play someone else's copy if offered.

RATING: 8
Lots of tough choices in Through the Desert.  Having 5 caravans to deal with almost seem superfluous at first as you really have only enough turns to extend 2 or at most 3 of them fully, but I suppose it does give you more options to work with once other people start to cut your's off at various point in the game.  It definitely seems overwhelming in the beginning, having so many things you could do but only a limited actions to perform.  The flow of the game becomes more chaotic as you increase the number of participants, so I imagine with 2-player it is much more strategic and require careful planning, much like in chess and go.  Timing is everything.

Right now, my rating's a 9.  I would always want to play this...all I can say is wow.  I'd played it a couple of times and never saw how awesome this game is.  After teaching the game to 5 that had never played before, then teaching it to my wife and kids and playing it a couple more times, it all clicks on how cool this game actually is.  Rating update: I can see myself playing this whenever; I don't think I'll ever grow tired of it.  It just seems to have a timeless quality about it, and it scales wonderfully.  A true 10, for certain!

This is a fun game, but I don't think it offers the range of decisions a classic euro does. Still it's easy to break out and play, and new folks who aren't necessarily into gaming are typically charmed by the camels.

A nice abstract game once the theme is deleted. It's not a great game but is alright and requires some thought. Bum rushing bonus points seems nice at the beginning but a deeper strat is required for end game. As usual of Knizia, there are lots of ways to acquire points and the winner is usually the one least expected.

After 5+ Plays: I didn't like it with 5 so much, but it was better with 4.  I'd like to try it with two or three.  The colors really did bother me, and I wish the riders were brighter primary colors.  I probably added 5 minutes to the total game time by myself just trying to find my pieces.

I didn’t have high expectations for this Knizia game since I’m not a big fan of Euphrates & Tigris and Samuraï. What a surprise, Durch die Wüste is a pure MASTERPIECE! This game has got everything to please me : scales very well from 2 to 5 players, simple rules, plays fast (under 45 minutes), requires a good amout of thinking without being dry, great bits with unusual colors and it’s got a high replay value. If you wanna have a good idea of the game before buying it, go play-by-mail on www.ludagora.net (great interface, btw) Maybe you will dream about camels as I did after my first plays J

Very fun game that is simple to understand and can be played with great thought if one desires. Excellent bits.

What keeps it from a higher score: There's not a lot of flash in the game, and the cool bits don't fit the fairly drab board.

The depth of play is likely higher than my rating suggests, I just find the game overly dry and ugly, making it a somewhat uninspiring passtime.

A fun and quick camel placing game. It's easy to introduce to non-gamers and has a lot of depth.

It's not colour-blind friendly however, so it won't see much play with my regular group.

Great little game - low in complexity, high in strategy.  Had a beginning setup that reminded me immensely of Settlers of Catan.  Also comes with a butt load of pastel coloured camels, how can this be bad?  :)
First played at UK GenCon '07, read the rules in 5 minutes and played with a friend.  This shows you how simple it is.
Sadly, when introducing this to the other half of our regular game group, they were less than thrilled.  The argument of 'pastel coloured hippo' placement, and the ultimate fruitlessness of the game arose, and I vowed I'd never try it with them again  :)

Nice choices to be taken each turn: many oppurtunities, few actions. The feeling is similar to Go. High importance of the initial placement.

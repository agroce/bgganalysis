First play shows a game that I don't think I'll ever be any good at but will be willing to play. It feels like there are just too many ingredients to deal with. Love the action cards - that really makes life easier. And the components are as everyone has said - very nice indeed. The rice bowls! In the end, not a game I'm likely to hang on to. Sold it.

RATING: 6.6
Regalado y estupendo. Esta bastante gracioso, como juego familiar. Consiste en formar recetas en vertical/horizontal colocando ingredientes en el tablero, como si fuera un scrabble pero con cartas de acciones especiales para modificar el caos de tablero que se va formando xD. muuucho caos y quebraderos de cabeza para intentar conseguir las combinaciones para las recetas.

RATING: 4.7
It's a really colorful game with lots of pieces. It's good to play with people who aren't necessarily hardcore gamers, but there isn't that much repetitive gameplay. Especially since most people just start craving sushi at some point. I also think that while the menus are aesthetically pleasing, game pieces don't comfortably fit into them.

Fun puzzle-y tile placement game. I had fun with it but not enough to encourage a purchase. It was a fun distraction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Strangely, I do not consider Wasabi as a "true" boardgame. For me, it is more of a ... tool (for lack of a better word) to entertain guests when/while/after preparing actual sushi. I would never even think about playing it simply as a board game. Because as such, it is rather simple and not very creative. But when the smell of rice vinegar and Nori leafs is in the air, while you are looking forward to all sorts of Sashimi and that ridiculously large California roll, Wasabi suddenly works its magic, and the game is exceedingly fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Top-notch production and components.  The endgame was weird and off-putting, but I'll definitely be trying it a couple more times.

Update: It was better when I played with all of the rules.  :)

RATING: 4
This is not a bad game - I can definitely see its appeal among many people who like it.  However I have a lot of trouble with visual games which focus on finding patterns.  This is one of those.  Just not my type of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Tile-laying in order to form patterns for scoring purposes.  The special cards make a big difference since they enable additional actions, such as swapping tiles or stacking them.

There's no real depth here.  The game is thin.  You can do well if others happen to leave you alone.  Go after the biggest one (the 5-ingredient recipe) first, then score a smaller one, then a bigger one, etc.  Towards the end, it can be difficult to score the bigger ones.  Always aim for style as the extra points can make a big difference.

I forget how many times I've played this, but I've won most (if not all) of my games so far.  There's no mystery here, nothing to learn, nothing all that new.  This one just bores me.  It's a decent game, but I am generally reluctant to play it.  I'd much rather be playing something more interesting.  On the bright side, the production value is good.  Nice pieces, nice board, nice menus, nice artwork.  And it involves sushi.  Otherwise, go play Carc.

RATING: 5.5
A very light family game that is great for the kids and does not take too long to play. 

What starts as organized tile-laying quickly ends into a chaotic change of recipes to gain that 2 pointer. 

It's one of those games that starts well but not end that well due to board restrictions or card play. Victory is dependent on recipe at hand. Not exactly a bad thing but a turn behind is usually not good. 

An average game overall. Good for a quick evening filler game.

A very fun, thematic tile laying game. The wasabi pieces, menu cards, wasabi dishes, and artwork were a nice touch! Good to do your 5 ingredient item first while there are multiple spaces on the board. Don't forget to make those recipes with style and to use the strategy cards carefully.

Simple tile laying/set collection game with beautiful components. Works well enough for a family game. The cards are really key since the board can fill up quickly and leave you with few options. Then your only chance is having the cards to help remake parts of the board in your favor.

Played once with 4 players. Random + chaos = "rasberry" (thank you, Archie Bunker). Definitely pretty and nicely produced (maybe a little pretentious: do we need a bowl to collect green cubes!?!?), but not much, if anything, new in the game itself. I will concede, however, that I see why this is so popular for newer gamers. Maybe if I had played this earlier--like 3 0r 4 years ago--I'd find it fun. To this cranky seasoned gamer, however, it's a derivative/mishmash of other games' mechanics packaged nicely. Not a bad game at all, just uninspiring.

Light game, but it can be brutal with 4 players.  There is never enough room and if one person is somehow able to sneak in a 5 piece (especially if it's in style) then it's really hard to win.  Unfortunately it really doesn't pay to be defensive with 3-4 players, since it helps the other two players more than it helps you.

Wasabi! is surprisingly popular as a gateway game.  By playing sushi ingredients to finish recipes, players can enjoy the "simplicity" of scrabble while imagining eating fancy food!  The tiles look tasty and the recipes sound fun.  People I know with no interest in "board games" are always interested in playing a game about sushi!

My favourite food in a game! 
Simple to explain, fun to play, looks really nice. A solid short game.
I normaly start off this game by saying "It's like scrabble with Sushi ingredients"
The kitchen cards allow you to bend the rules and affect the board in interesting ways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Looks that kill.  I'm hard-pressed to come up with a more pleasantly thematic physical presentation, and that includes Zoch games.  If you have any knowledge of sushi I think the look will make you smile.  The game worked very well, IMO.  Competitive puzzle.  Seems like lots of luck, but it played quickly with 3P.  Not sure how slow it might get with 4P.  Looks like it might play well with 2P.  Enough with the "P" discussion.  I think this could be a modest hit with families.  Seems like it might have eventual replay issues with recipe order optimizations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
High high high marks for the components.  Overproduced or not, it is a high-quality production.  I wish the game were better.  It's not bad, it's very puzzly, but it's too easy just to get completely left in the dust.  I would play again, but I'm not champing at the bit.

Beautiful game, thematically. The production value of the game is good. Unfortunately, the game is very AP-prone, and there's a lot of pattern-matching and memorization aspects that I find a bit tedious. I think the game is clever, but not very enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mixing an area control-ish game with a set collection-ish game makes for an unique game.  Play is focused on getting ingredients down on the board, but in a particular order and/or grouping.  When done, players can snag said ingredients to complete orders they have on their menu.  Its an odd mix of mechanics that oddly works.  The Z-man release is very well made with excellent components.  Thematic components abound.  For food fans and those that like quirky and unusual games.

RATING: 3.5
Wasabi! is described as a light and fast game where you compete against other players to assemble your quota of unique sushi recipes in a rapidly dwindling space.

Unfortunately, the desire to optimise a move whilst tying up ingredients with recopies left me frustrated, as I could not spend the time I wanted to analyse the situation without ruining the 'fast flow' experience.  Coupled with the switching of an ingredient just as I was finally about to complete a 5 ingredient recipe left me not only frustrated but with no desire to play again.

Out of Print (OOP).

Quite impressed how the game is tighter at 4 players than 3 or 2 players. I think this should be played with 4 players as the board and the ingredients are more challenging.

However, this game can be very unforgiving because once you fail to complete the recipe it takes a long time to cycle and get the right ingredients. Furthermore, once everyone else are steadily completing recipes and you are still struggling to cycle through and complete the recipe it will be very difficult to catch up.

Initial Impression: The components of this game are top-notch. It's hard to remember that the bamboo mat is really a board. The main mechanism of the game is tile-laying, but the difficulty lies in the fact that there's not alot of real estate to play in. This claustrophobia forces the opponents to have to screw around with each other's plans. Overall, I enjoy the game and want to play more of it.

The menu shields were a real missed opportunity to list the ingredients for each dish, which might have helped the players predict what their opponents might be trying to complete.

RATING: 5
An interesting game of strategic tile placement.  It has a lot of moments where players will be able to significantly damage their opponents which makes for a really challenging game.  The biggest drawback is the amount of decisions that need to be made after a recipe is completed.  Between picking a new recipe, a new ingredient, and an action card, this can really bog down in analysis-paralysis.  Those moments can change this light simple sprint of a game into a slow crawling marathon.  Still, the production quality is high and the art is great.  And if you can play with gamers who will make their decisions rapidly, it's not a bad game at all.

An pretty good abstract, puzzle-esque game.  

I would like to have a list of all recipes to avoid accidentally helping opponents.  Also, luck of the draw for recipes is significant so it might be better if you could draw 2 recipes and keep 1... because sometimes you get totally random crappy recipes.

This has lost a bit of its shine over the years.  I still enjoy the occasional game, but I'm not clamoring to play.

The special actions cards are a bit annoying.  New player to gaming completely ignore the cards because they are completely overwhelmed with the game mechanics, and get hammered by the people who know how to use them.  The game can't be played effectively without the cards, and this is a big flaw in the the design IMO.

Played twice with 4 and once with 2.  This game seems light on the surface, with a lot of luck in what tiles and recipes you pick to start with.  The strategy is actually in how you cycle your smaller, easier to complete recipes to get cards so you can complete the big recipe.  There is a rhythm to the game that varies from game to game.  Highly enjoyable, easy to teach, and doesn't take long to play.  Takes some thinking, but still simple enough for anyone.  This is an ideal gateway/medium game.  Highly recommended!

Es un juego de preparar recetas de comida japonesa. Dicho así, uno puede esperar un chorrijuego para pasar el rato, pero resulta ser un juego muy cerebral y que da mucho que pensar. La presentación del juego es excelente (parece que estas en un restaurante). En cada turno, cada jugador coloca un ingrediente sobre el "mantel", que es el tablero de juego. Cuando consigue alinear los ingredientes adecuados a una de las recetas que tiene que preparar (tres cada jugador), consigue una carta, puntúa, y obtiene una nueva receta. Las cartas permiten hacer operaciones especiales sobre el tablero (apilar ingredientes, cambiarlos de sitio, etc). Cuando no queda sitio para más ingredientes el juego termina y gana el que más puntos haya obtenido.
Sencillo de explicar y de jugar y con mucha chicha. Algo de suerte hay (la receta que te toca), pero no es determinante.

Not that good of a game.  I compare it to connect four, but much more difficult to set up scoring combinations.  The card play is interesting, but seems to end up rewarding the player who first scores these cards by making it easier for them to complete additional recipes.

RATING: 7
Fun abstract with a cooking theme. Well done in that it is easy to learn, and turns in within an hour - perfect for what it offers - a set collection of ingredients, arranging in order for points and bonuses. The card play allows for correction in the recipe order if someone else unkowningly (or otherwise) plays an ingredient altering your order.

Great components and rather light and simple game in its heart. Action cards bring more possibilities which is fine but it also brings the issue of downtime to the play. This might be a problem with AP players.

Works with non-gamers and families and the theme definitely attracts audience which wouldn't otherwise play games.

I'm not sure why Wasabi! gets all the knocks it does.  Yeah, it's not the deepest game in the world, but most descriptions seem to portray it as a chaotic mess, with almost no chance for meaningful play, which seems absurd to me.  Granted, we play with 2, which might be best with this game, but there is definitely a good amount of game in here.  Yes, it is basically set collection played with an open hand, and yes, it is more appetizer than main course, but we've had a lot of fun with it.  Our games tend to be very close, with one person completing their last roll just at the board could close out, or one of us scrambles to shut the board down and end the game.  The components here are fantastic, and illustrate how, for me personally, good design and solid components can elevate a game.  Would the game be fundamentally fun without the nice production value?  Yes, but the fine production value does add a lot and elevates the game to being something more than it would be otherwise.  I'd highly recommend this game, especially for two - perhaps we'll tire of it eventually, but I'd say it has more legs than most give it credit for.

RATING: 6
Fun game components (love the dipping dishes), but luck plays a large role in the game -- too large for my taste.  You can make smart choices to try to take advantage of whatever luck may bring, but it won't overcome the gap that results when someone lucks into a recipe or two because the player(s) before them played ingredients they can use.  Terrible game with 4 - the board changes too much between your turns to have any kind of strategy.  Much better with 2 or 3.

WARNING: No AP players should get within 10 feet of this game. It's a great game taken casually, but the brain-burn potential (especially in the 2-player game) is high. Avoid that pitfall, and it's a fine game.

Played this at Origins (playtest of prototype) and thought it was a fun romp.  Being a sushi fan helped, sure, but the game was a different kind of tile game that fits a new niche.  Will happily buy upon release.  Can't wait.

First impression: Annoying design of the board game with unending horizontal lines on the board and game pieces, distracts one from the actual crux of game: the ingredients. While it tries to be thematically consistent (sushi on bamboo mats, hence plenty of horizontal lines), it did not help that the colours used to differentiate the various categories were too similar as well.

Very fast to learn and to play.  Rented from boardgamerevolution.com to see if it is worth buying.  We probably won;t.

Maybe we need to learn a little more about how the game works!

One of the funnest themes I have played.  Beautifully rendered game pieces make this puzzle and tile-laying game a pleasure to handle.  The player screens imitate leather-bound menus, the wasabi cubes are a terrific wasabi green and the art work is both realistic and cartoonish, if that is possible.

A bit of chaos with 4 players makes the game light.  With 2 players, there is a lot opportunity for future planning and screwage with your opponent.

Nice work by some good Canadian kids, eh.

The components are pretty nice, although the slots in the screen for your recipes could work a lot better. I was constantly pulling mine out to see them and knocking everything over.
The gameplay is dominated by luck. In a 3-4 player game, whoever gets the leaching opportunities has a huge advantage. And not knowing the recipes others are working on eliminates any chance to manage this.

Bleh!  Bad game.  Really bad game.  

There are certain types of games that have certain "annoying" parts/mechanics - like player screwage, or randomness, or the permanance of an opponents' choices.

This game combines a multitude of these bad things, and doesn't allow a player to "fix" the position that someone else has put them into.  The only way to fix your situation is with the help of a card, but the only way to get a card is to complete a recipe, but the only way to complete a recipe is with the help of a card, but you can't get a card if you don't complete a recipe...

Ug...forget the fact that I lost the only game that I played (or ever plan to play).  This game does not allow you to counter-act your opponent's choices.  You can't do anything about what they do, short of making all 8 of your "2-ingredient" recipies, and hope your opponents don't score more than 15 points.

I hate this game, and the hype that goes with it completely undeserved.

Shades of Days of Wonders Collesuem where you build a recipe from the elements on the board. Plenty to think about and balance, and an oppotunist will do well in this one. A step on from the gateway game, but not too heavy as to scare your friends away. A good socialable game.

Light strategy and quite puzzle-like. 

Luck-based only in that you're banking on your opponents laying down the tiles you need - but even then, the cards mitigate the luck-factor, allowing you some control. 

The game ramps up the more tiles that are placed on the board. A bit of a brain burner.

Really nice components.

Deeper than you think.  Works with the "spouse/non gamer" type, but make sure you tell them to hold on to some smaller recipes for the end of the game.  Action cards are CRUCIAL to finishing higher value recipes, and the only way to get an easy one is to save a small recipe for the end game.

I love sushi, which really does improve my enjoyment of the game. I'd like to eat all these combinations we come up with.

In the end, Wasabi is a decent enough game....but not my type of thing. Its light, the manipulation of the board is very abstract and doesn't match the theme at all. Its basically a decent abstract game wearing a beautiful evening dress. I may have a nice night out, but during quiet moments I'll notice that underneath that dress and make-up, its a very plain and unexciting design.

I'd be willing to play if someone else suggested it, but I never need to own this or will request it.

I want to like this game more than I actually do.  Degrading from 6 to 5 because there is too much luck with the recipes.

Dec. 7, 2008 -- Not really my kind of game. It's a thinker, for sure, but a little too slow for my liking. Also, it has one of the more bizarre themes. I'm not saying it doesn't work, but I found it difficult to get into a game about making sushi. 5/10

A nice puzzler which I typically enjoy.  Played with two which seemed a bit too easy, but I'm not a huge fan of chaos, so 4 may be too much for me -- perhaps 3 would be ideal.

Not bad. To steal someone else's analogy, it's Scrabble with incredients as letters and recipes as words, and you can only play one letter (ingredient) at a time, and also don't have to follow strict order of the ingredients (but if you do follow order you get a bonus). And a few cards that give you special abilities. The special abilities can muck up your plans, of course. I don't know if I was just tired, but I found myself oddly AP prone playing this. Perhaps because when you put your recipes in the holder (menu), you only see the top of each ingredient, and I would get the confused. There's also no way to get rid of a recipe or an ingredient you don't want (other than wasting your turn to play the ingredient). Nor is there a way to choose recipes using ingredients you want. Both of those might be interesting, except would probably make me play even slower. I'm told this is normally a fast game. I can probably believe it, if not played at the end of the night (a little more thinky than filler fare). Might also be better as a 3p (I played 4p), as not as much hosage between turns for a little more feasibility in planning.

Although the theme of this game is interesting (make Sushi!) and the components are excellent, right down to the little green Wasabi cubes, the gameplay falls flat.

Played once; got into a situation where I had no Chop/Stack/Switch action cards when the board hit about 2/3 full, and was unable to complete a recipe for the rest of the game. I can see why you're not allowed to hoard action cards - otherwise, you'd want to save most of them for the (very cramped / constrained) endgame! Would like to try it again, now that I have a better feel for the flow of the game.

RATING: 6
This is essentially an abstract game, but the theme is fun even if it's not essential. It has great bits with the bowls and menus. Just about anyone can play it and it always seems to draw a crowd. I like the fact that you get to chose which card you get after completing a recipe. It lets you plan ahead a little more. Really, the only luck in this game is which recipes you get.

Love the graphics.  The game plays well too although I often find I can't 'see' recipes just by looking at the board, almost because the graphics are too rich or something.  There's no 'gestalt' about the recipes, and I don't think this goes away as you play more. Sometimes feels like there's a runaway leader problem too - although since it plays quickly that's easily fixed: 'best of 3?'

A gorgeous production decorates a pretty darn good game.  Experience certainly helps with this game (knowing what recipes are out there) as does keeping an eye on your opponents (what ingredients are they playing?  What might they be building?  Can and should I block them?).  Managing the action cards is very important as well.  Can cause analysis paralysis in players prone to such.

Tasty theme.  Unfilling gameplay.

Like many of these kinds of pattern-building games, the fact that the patterns (recipes, in this case) are secret means there's not a lot of strategy.  It mostly comes down to who draws the right things at the right time.

Eh, you just try to lay tiles to complete a pattern while getting the way of another player. There wasn't anything notable in the game play or in the theme that would make me want to play this game again. Instead, I'd rather play a tile laying game like Cacao.

Have a few plays under my belt now and it's always a good time. It works well with serious and not-so-serious gamers, and scales from 2-4 players like a champ.

Interestingly, my 7-year-old loves it and often asks to play, even though he sometimes gets frustrated -- it's a bit heavier than I would normally recommend for young kids.

The recipe cards are thin to the point of being hard to handle, but aside from that, the components and artwork are fabulous.

I can understand why people might like this game, I simply don't. I'll play again though. I do think the game can be enhanced a few ways one of which is having the recipes on the player shield.

I also think there is a runaway leader issue that can be resolved somehow.

Even more beautiful in person.  Good two player. But you must get a little nasty to make it a game.  Otherwise, the board is too open and both players can coast.  Without conflict, I imagine that the start player would win every time.  UPGRADE.  2 player and 4 player versions are quite different.

RATING: 5
Obtained in a trade, along with a D&D module, for Silent War.  A nice filler.  The components are a mixed bag.  The heavy tiles are well made, and colorful, but the artwork is crude and basic, and leaves the door wide open for various gross, disgusting, or even scatalogical comparisons by the more juvenile-minded members of your game group.  (You know who you are!)  The recipe slips are very thin, difficult to pick up off a table, and the menu folder is flimsy, and knocks over very easy.  Overall, just an average game with sub-par components that I had hoped would be better.

My Review: [thread=880975]A Year With Wasabi![/thread]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Match a sequence of sushi-type-food tiles to a "recipe" sequence to score points.  The sushi theme is cool and gets it an extra point.  I can't believe this game includes little black bowls for the wasabi cubes.  The bowls need to be made part of the game somehow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Seems a bit too high chaos for my taste. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players are chefs competing in a Japanese kitchen, preparing orders.  Players take turns to play an ingredient into the "kitchen", a common gridded area on the game board.  If a set of ingredients line up orthogonally, and match their recipe then it's complete and can be cashed in for points.  Recipes completed "with style" (!) earn wasabi cubes which are bonus points at the end of the game.  A rather so-so game of placement, spiced up with action cards and astonishingly good components.  This is one beautiful looking game... one of the best I've seen in years.

Great example of how production values and theme implementation can sometimes make all the difference.  This game is all about the bling.   Otherwise, it's just an abstract tile-laying game where you are trying to create rows or columns of prescribed tile sequences.   Requires a lot of thinking (pattern recognition), which you can be doing when it's not your turn.

Straightforward tile laying game to score points for completing rows.

RATING: 7
This game stands out more by its colors than it does its great gameplay. Too much of the game is decided by being fortunate enough to draw a recipe that has most of the components already on the board. However, there is a hidden fun factor in the game probably due to the unique sushi theme.

Reasonably light game that still requires a lot of mental effort to find the good combinations. There are just too many permutations of what can happen and it's too easy for someone else's play to derail your carefully laid plans.

Fine game to break out for the non-gamers because the rules are extremely easy to grok, but the lack of depth and the inability to formulate a real strategy prevent this game from really being good.

1 játék eddig. Jó ötlet a szusi készítés. Kiegyenlített játék menet, bár a lepakolások csúnyán keresztül húzhatják a számításod.Szóval néha mit sem ér a tervezés. De ezért vannak a megszerezhető bonusok, igaz csak ha lepakolsz vmit van esélyed megszerezni ezeket, és persze ezekből sem korlátlan van, néha csak olyat tudsz-tudnál megszerezni, amire épp nincs szükséged.de ha jót és jókor szerzel meg, akkor a nagyobb étel költemények elkészítése sem lehetetlen. Ugyanakkor bár úgy érzem, h jól, szerencsésen tudtam lepakolni, így gyakorlatilag szinte hibátlan volt a játékom, mégse tudtam első lenni: azonos pont mellett a wasabik száma döntött - nem nekem. Szóval így elsőre 7, de kéne újra játszás, látok esélyt a 8-s értékre is, igaz arra is marad.

Wasabi is a decent tile laying game with really nice components.  I think it's function is primarily a gateway game.  Unfortunately there are games that I find to be more interesting and serve better as a gateway game.  The game also bears a lot of resemblance to Die Sterne Stehen Richtig (The Stars are Right).  I consider Wasabi to be easier, a bit more balanced and less prone to having a runaway leader.  Unfortunately, I don't enjoy the theme as much despite how nice the components are and how well integrated they are to the theme.

My friends and I love sushi, and this game is a fun way to share that love and have some laughs while doing it.

My first experience with foam core was with this game.  It's functional and makes the setup easier.  Sadly used a bit too much glue and the insert itself is glued to the box.

Another of the many recent games with beautiful production values and uninspired game play.

Played once.  It's a fabulous production, a beautiful game.  I got hungrier playing this!  The game play itself didn't grab me, though, and I don't like that it's possible for a player to get "wedged" and have to suffer through the rest of the game as a result.  My opinion might improve with more plays.

Amusingly themed and attractive, this game plays easily.  Its principle flaws are game components that are sometimes too similar in appearance and the possibility of being crippled from the very start by the wrong combination of randomly selected recipes demanding ingredients that are simply not available.

Interesting line-forming tile game. Wasabi is rather simple, but after a play it's easy to see that there is plenty of room to improve your play. Seems as if this game would be best with three, I don't see myself suggesting this title at 4.

It's a game that rewards a lot of forethought and planning, which is absolutely critical to getting the 5-ingredient piece out "with style". Also has a very nice theme. 

But there's one major downer. The analysis paralysis at the endgame is ridiculous. It's even worse than Santiago. At least in Santiago, it's just a straightforward mathematical calculation. Here, there are so many possible permutations based on board position and action cards, your eyes will start to swim.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really fun game. I love the premise, and I think that has a great deal to do with the appreciation of it. The game mechanics are also pretty well done, with the only thing being that there can be a breakaway winner. The limitation with cards can be a bit of a discouragement when a player hordes specific ones, but for me at least does not detract from the fun of making sushi on a board.

RATING: 2
Boring. Fiddly. Pasted on theme. It takes many turns to execute a recipe and there are just as many opportunities for your opponents to mess with you. It's very hard to set up any kind of strategy. Excellent components, but with no box insert storage and set up is a pain. Game play is simple yet somehow seems inelegant. Player interaction is cutthroat, which I don't usually like, and in this game it is overly harsh.

RATING: 6
A cute and very visually appealing game that is way more tactical than strategic. With 3 or 4 players the game becomes quite chaotic as one must react, often unsucessfully, to the ever-changing board.

There is a big dose of luck added by the blind draws from the recipe piles.  This can sometimes either confound your recipe plans or get you a quick and easy completion.

Wasabi can be played nicely or cut-throat.  The wasabi card especially can be a little too hostile with a real screw-it-to-you element, although it also can be played for a quick tactical game-end.  As a family game, we sometimes leave this card out.

Wasabi is a generally fun, quick little game, that for me can be frustratingly chaotic with more players.

With more plays the sweet spot for this seems to be 3 players as with 4 the board gets crowded quite quickly.

Beautiful game.  Feels a little like Ticket To Ride only more complicated to win.  We played (3) 2-player games on Christmas Eve (my wife gave me this game as a gift) and really liked it.  I'm certain we will play it again.

I think it takes a couple of plays to get down how to do things that make sense and then you can start to pay attention to what the other players are doing and how to either mess them up or at least anticipate what they may be doing.

The screens are cool but could have been even more interesting for game-play if they showed the ingredients needed to all the recipes.  This would make it easier to "guess" what the other players are probably doing.

Fun game and the production values are outstanding.

Neste jogo cada jogador é um sushiman e tem que, seguindo algumas receitas, fazer pratos de sushis com os ingredientes que estão no tabuleiro. Na mão nos temos sempre 3 ingredientes e 3 receitas. Na nossa jogada podemos colocar um ingrediente no tabuleiro e completar quantas receitas forem possíveis ganhando pontos por isso. Existem receitas de 2, 3, 4 e 5 ingredientes. Adicionalmente ao completar uma receita você pode ganhar wasabi (pontos extras) e/ou recebe cartas que dão habilidades diferentes como mudar ingredientes de local, remover do tabuleiro, colocar dois ingredientes de uma vez, etc. É um puzzle bem rápido e fácil. Tem um apelo visual legal e chama a atenção das mulheres. Isso é importante.

The components are beautiful and the game play is simple and fun.  This one is very non-gamer friendly.  Strategic depth is a bit limited, but I don't play this one when I want a brain burner.  I love sushi, so the theme is a big plus for me.

Likes: For some reason I like this theme. It makes me hungry. Similar to Scrable but certainly funner. Looks great too.  While completely unnescessary the little bowls are a great addition.  

Dislikes: Alot of AP potential. 

Overall: Wasabi is a great tile laying game that reminds me alot of scrabble only it's funner and the theme is great. C'mon, it's got crab.

Nifty.  A tad overproduced and a bit clumsier and drier in play than you'd expect.  But an OK light game carried almost entirely by a fun theme.  Decent family game, I guess.


EDIT:  This has got to be a record--from "must have" to "Traded" in less than a month's time.  Wasabi is another in a long line of totally 'adequate' games that are completely forgettable.  This was the spark, I think, in the beginnings of reducing my collection to games that actually matter.

The problem is, the game just doesn't function properly--draw tiles, hope for the best.  You can try strategy and arranging things to some degree, but you can still just get boned by tiles.  Players just stumble along until someone wins.

It's beautiful though, simply gorgeous.  But so is a Golden Retriever, and it's still a dog.

Very cute and actually a little bit of a brain-burning tile layer with a spicy theme!  It's quite easy-going for the most part, creating sets to complete objectives and gaining special power cards to help with future turns, with extra points for sequencing your sets correctly.  Wonderfully illustrated, excellent components, and a game that would be great for different types of gamers and a short amount of playing time.  It isn't more than what it is (a lighter type of game) but I'm always fond of lighter games that actually have some crunchy feel to them.  All in all, a very nice game!

Initial rating is 7 after 2, 2-player games.  Components are a 10, gameplay, while fun and interesting, seems to come down to a race to finish recipes.

Need to play more cutthroat and see how it goes.

My Variant(we tested once[2p] and it worked great):

First player to 30 points wins.  Wasabi are 1 point,
so a 5 recipe with style is worth 8+3=11 points.

You still have to use your tokens so a 2 recipe only strategy is out but you do not have to do the 5 or all the larger ones, etc. 


Even with variant this game has the cuteness but seems to lack the strategy and fun decisions you hope for when playing.

The games forces you to do certain size recipes instead of a who gets to what score first.  This mistake changes the gameplay in negative ways and makes the optimal strategy obvious.

I played this once and enjoyed it, but I would do better on my next play as I see the strategy of trying to complete your biggest menu items first as the board clutters up and you will not be able to complete them so easily towards the end of the game. Playing this always makes me hungry for sushi! Hell just typing this is making me hungry for sushi!

Now the 4 player game is fun it is also crazy every one is really messing every ones recipes up and well crazy is just the word.

Now as far as components i don't know a game thats theme is so well represented by its components. 

The components are well designed and of the highest quality

The theme and artwork are boring and uninspired, but the game is actually quite abstract, anyway. There is some luck and chaos: drawing recipes with some identical ingredients can be quite helpful, and players may inadvertently help or hurt their opponents. There are ways to manipulate the board and reverse the harm done, but you need action cards for that, and you only get one when you complete a recipe. All in all, it is still an enjoyable lightweight game, simple and quick, with enough tactical decisions.

After a recent play with 4-players, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would have been.  Yes, there was much more chaos but the bigger board size mitigates it to a small extent.  It makes the cards of greater significance and makes you more strongly consider which recipe sizes you're completing.  It's light enough for anyone to learn and play and is pretty fun and doesn't take too long.  It still has a bit too much random and chaos to really grab my attention but is fun nonetheless.  Old comments below still apply.

My friend's brother owns this game, but has let us borrow it.  It's pretty light, and pretty fun.  One downside, is that I can't imagine having any fun with more than 2 players.  Too much chaos would lead to too little strategy and too much luck.  Do I place tuna here and hope nobody blocks it?  At least with 2 players, you know when spots can get blocked and can anticipate what your opponent will do.  My fiancee enjoys it which is a definite plus.

Interesting and clever... the game fooled me into thinking I was making sushi, when all I was trying to do was arrange sequences of ingredients to match specific combinations. The game is simple and fast to play, with plenty of strategy. The game drips with theme, all the way down to the soy sauce  dish and wasabi cubes, which don't do anything except score extra points, but it's a nice touch. It reminds me of Hollywood Blockbuster, although the person who taught us said it was like Scrabble... Scrabble? Huh? Well, okay...

RATING: 7
A nifty and extremely pretty tile game that reminds me of Ticket to Ride, in that the players have secret goals they are trying to complete by drafting tiles  and playing them in a certain order on a shared board.  I definitely enjoyed it more than TTR, though, because if you happen to get blocked in one place, you can still work on that recipe somewhere else on the board.  I also enjoyed the special action cards, which reward you for completing recipes early by giving you special powers when you play them, like playing two tiles or stacking one tile on top of another.  

I am a little worried about the level five recipes, because there is only one for each special ingredient and once you memorize them it will likely become very difficult to set them up.  But I think this is at least somewhat alleviated with the cards.

And, seriously, theme and components: A++.  Beautiful, slightly goofy, and let's face it, sushi is awesome. 

Downgrading this a point after a frustrating game in which my recipes didn't match up with anyone else's.  There is a luck factor in that, and it's a little tricky to manage the cards, especially if you need to use the same one more than once.  But it is at least partly my fault too. (2 plays)

Gorgeous components. This game is not as light as I expected it to be. I've mostly played it 2-player. You really have to work plan ahead and think about how you will (1) complete a recipe in order to get an action card and (2) use the resulting action card to complete another recipe and be able to repeat this process. If you get stuck and can't chain (1) into (2), you've probably lost. Sometimes your opponent(s) will screw up your plans without even trying, and this becomes more likely as the player count increases.

Beautiful components for a very average game. Gets old after a few plays because there are only a set number of the 5-size sushis. After a couple plays, you can easily tell what the other players are going for and block which is a bit boring.

The best looking casual game I've picked up in a long time. Very cool dishes, and the Wasabi cubes rock. 

The game is fun too. It can be played by anyone. very easy to learn, play, and teach. Tough to make the orders...good game.

Is it the best ever?

No.

Is it a good game for anyone? Yes.

Is it a great game for sushi lovers? Yes.

It sold out at geek con 2008. I liked it, I bought it; I'll spread this around. Thanks to big-chad for teaching it!

Give it a shot. It's not a gamer's game, it's not heavy, it's just a good game. Thank you Zev. :)

One of 2 of the most unique themes I've played...hey, who wants to be a sushi chef?

That alone deserves a play. :)

Good game, great components.  There really is a lot more going on in this game that would be expected.  Is sort of a light brain burner.

***Updated, after a few more plays this game is very chaotic you really have very little control and if one person gets the lead its hard to stop him/her unless you guess correctly to stack or chop something they need.

The rules are simple, the mechanics are simple, however, the play is chaotic due to the nature of tile placement and the subtle use of a few action cards.  I'm sure this game is meant to be played at a fast pace, however, it can easily be prone to deep AP as the game progresses.  Overall, I'm not sure how I feel about the randomness in this game.  Needs more play.

Wasabi!  (or Sushi! in my case) is like Scrabble, but instead of creating words, players are creating sushi.  It's overly (and awesomely) thematic with the menus, wasabi bowls...heck, even the board resembles the sushi rolling mats.  Simply great presentation, but it doesn't end there.  There's a great game in the package.  While some players may get caught up in a tad bit of analysis paralysis, for the most part, turns go by fairly quickly.  Great game with excellent gameplay and a really fun theme.

Easy to teach and scales well enough, Wasabi plays like an ultra-light Reiner with theme. The theme and cool components do help to get non-gamers involved.

UPDATE:

The last couple of games have gone 1hr+ hour due to AP. Some AP is understandable but Wasabi is too light for it. Wasabi needs to be played quickly or it can become a tedious exercise.

This is a well themed game of placing ingredient tiles in a horizontal or vertical line to complete recipes. Recipes vary from two to five ingredients, but you are limited in how many of each length you can complete. You are all building on the same board so you can work off other players' tiles, but they also might block you. There are some cards which can help change the board to your advantage. Longer recipes score more points and completing a recipe with the ingredients in the same order as on the recipe gives a bonus.

RATING: 6
The theme and the great components make the game. At its core it's a simple abstract of laying down patterns spiced with a few extra actions to interfere with your opponent. With the maximum of four players I doubt that there's much control. But the wasabi cubes, the ingredient tiles and the menus serving as player screens win players over for a casual game of preparing sushi. If there's more plays in it after the novelty of the components wears off?
Side note: The German translation of the ingredients must have been done by somebody who doesn't know a single thing about food. Green onions = grüne Zwiebeln?

The best theme I can imagine in a Scrabble inspired game. The special ability cards are interesting, but the best part is definitely the components. They are in my top 10 game components ever.

Although I once swore that sushi was "bait", after moving west I've learned to really enjoy it, so this game was a natural for me.  I like the challenge of having to complete recipes and find the right ingredients.  What I don't like is there not being a guide to the various recipes.  I'm sure there's one here on the Geek, and fresh out of the box, we didn't have it.  Still a fun game, though.

Great components with nice, vibrant graphic design.  This is a good example of what many games could do if they dared to embrace alternate themes.  The component quality (from a design standpoint) is very high.  Though the tiles and cards definitely feel like they're made in China.  The price point is very good and makes you feel like you got a good deal when see all the components.  Playing with chopsticks would make the game complete, you could follow up with a rousing game of Chopstick Dexterity Megachallenge 3000.

The game itself is alright, best if played quickly.  It can be very frustrating if you're chaos-averse, as your best laid plans can be ruined very easily.  But the play time seems just about right for the weight, not outstaying its welcome.

Nice and easy crossword laying game. A player has to lay the required ingredients into a horizontal or vertical sequence. It is possible to use tiles, which were placed earlier by other players, but everyone must finish their sushi by themselves. Only the beginning is a little bit strange - the players must pick the ingredients for their neighbour without even known what are their missions. Sometimes a player is stuck with two useless tiles out of three for the entire game.

Neblogas nesudėtingas kryžiažodžių dėliojimo žaidimas. Reikia išdėlioti reikalingus ingredientus į horizontalią ar vertikalią eilę. Galima naudotis kitų žaidėjų anksčiau padėtais, bet užbaigti visada reikia pačiam. Tik kiek keistoka žaidimo pradžia - reikia išrinkti ingredientus savo kaimynui dar net nežinant, kokias misijas vykdysi pats. Kartais lieki su dviem nenaudingom kortelėm iš trijų visą žaidimą.

Comment after one play at BGG.CON:

I thought the bits were cute.  I thought the game was OK, but a lot of people seem to like it a lot.  My main complaint was that there were too many different symbols.  The game is pretty simple, on each turn you place a ingredient tile on the board and then try to match the recipes you have.  You have 3 recipes at a time.  Each recipe has 2, 3, 4, or 5 ingredients.  The problem I have is that there are 20 some different ingredients which makes it tough for me to look at the board and look for rows or columns that match.

I was told that this one is a decent 2-player game. My rating therefore reflects my willingness to try this as a 2- or 3-player session. With four players it was boring and helplessly watching from the side as other players accidentally keep on ruining your sushi is just stupid. And I really mean that this happens accidentally: Of course others are trying to complete their sushi, but when you are just sitting there with your recipes and it doesn't matter what you do on your turn, because that doesn't change a thing, then it's not so good for the flow of the game. Also, the Wasabi card could have been left out from the final design. The theme is great and well implemented, but where is ginger?

2014-03-15 - Good light game with great, great components. If you like sushi you can get really hungry playing it. 
I played only with two players, which is more strategic way to play. With more players it will probably get more chaotic which can be funny. On the other hand I'm afraid that with more players everyone will think much longer, but maybe not.

2015-04-05 - 7->6. It's OK, components are awesome. Still didn't try more than two.

Bought from Essen 2008. Offers some interesting decisions to make, but yes, there is a quite big luck-factor included. Not a brainer, not a filler. Most of the time 'Wasabi!' is a game, where you just try to maximize your points on every round and you don't have any clue what the others are planning to do. If you are lucky enough, you might harm the scoring opportunites of others, but you never know. The game itself is easy to teach and play. The best part of the game is it's look: it's just gorgeous!

I think you have to love Japanese food to enjoy Wasabi as much as I did. Its design is gorgeous, also it's a fine game, but I'm sure I wouldn't like it so much if it was only an abstract without its thin theme.
Update: Played a 3-player game where I had no chance to do anything because of bad luck and timing of card draws by the other two players. I don't think it was my mistake. 7.3-->7.0. I still hope it's a rare situation.

RATING: 7
Although this is a tile-laying game, it's more like a puzzle game like [i]Bejeweled[/i] than a game like [GAMEID=822].  It's a race to complete recipes of various lengths of ingredients.  However, like [GAMEID=822], you can easily play this game as nicely or aggressively as you want---you can just busy yourself in your own corner, or you can try to interrupt your opponent or slap down the Wasabi card to block them.  The different action cards give you a lot of special flexibility in completing recipes.  There is also some overall strategy to the game, as you have to decide which recipes to finish---the shorter recipes are easier and the first urge is to save them for the end of the game, but they give you the valuable action cards when completed which can be a huge advantage earlier in the game.  The actual gameplay can be a little fiddly, since if you finish a recipe, you have to pick up a new recipe, a new ingredient, and a new action card while the other player waits for you, but it's not too bad.

It probably works the best as a two player game, as you have more control and the game feels less random and chaotic between turns.  You also have more space to place your tiles.  Although there is a little luck in your recipe draw, it's not a driving factor---I lost the first ten or so games that we played.  That may have also played a role in her liking the game a lot.

This is it. This is the last straw. I will never ever play another Wasabi game again. My last game was so boring that I just threw as many tiles out as possible in order to end the game quickly.

Here we go again with the component:fun ratio.  This game has FAR too many components for how "fun" it is.  I might actually prefer to not play a game at all than to play Wasabi.  It takes up tons of table space.  The menus (cardholders) are awkward.  It's too easy to gather the ingredients you want.  And then I'm just placing tiles on a board. 

The game looks great, which is very deceiving and has a lovely theme, which is very deceiving.  It just isn't very fun. If you want to play a game that looks good, has wonderful components, and takes up your entire table, just play Caverna.

RATING: 7
Granted, the game has its limits. It's a really simple game, which doesn't take all that long to play. It might get repititive after a while, even if you vary the gameplay with some of your own rules, which, in turn, are quite easy to implement. This, however, is not really a problem, since the game is not meant to be a so called "main event" game, but something you can play with your brain turned off. I can't help but like the game, it manages to amuse me everytime I play it. Also a nice couple's game, especially since the gameplay does not really involve as much thinking out loud as most other games and thus leaves room for casual conversation.

I had this at 9, and that was too high. I like this game a lot, but it hasn't worn well. It's also not as accessible as I thought it would be. It requires some comfort with spatial thinking that a lot of non-gamers (and gamers, actually) don't have.

Dripping with theme, incredible amounts of chrome, and interesting game play leave this one at 7. It's still too random to be better, but certainly worth occasional table time.

Update:

This game is about pattern recognition and tile placement. I think playing with a full compliment is chaos, but the game is so fast and flavorful it doesn't really matter.

Easy to learn and play, and has a nice family-friendly theme. Fairly enjoyable for a simple tile-placement game. Luck plays a substantial factor (via which recipes you draw), but not enough to completely hamstring the 'strategy' element. Plus, everybody loves sushi...

RATING: 7
This game is very simple.  Some have compared it to Scrabble with pictures.  Many gamers don't like it but it is a slightly deeper game than you would think on the surface.  The Wasabi card can be used to good effect in the game and once players realize this, the game takes on a different character.  I have actually increased the rating on this one as I have played more.

Picked up from FunGamesCafe Dec 2008

Played once, 2 player, attractive bits, but the mechanics are a bit fiddly. Needs a few more plays, but it feels like a 6 or a 6.5 to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mostly a tactical puzzle game.  Light, easy to learn, fun and colorful.  An easy game for a mixed-crowd or family, very nice looking pieces and fun theme.  

Only luck is in which recipes you pull (which you hope have ingredients already in place), but this is lessened by the fact that you get to decide how challenging (2 - 5 ingredients) and you can exchange recipes you don't want to keep.  

I'd say it should take 30 -45 mins for a game unless someone is AP-prone.  A good filler game or just something easy to play with a non-gaming crowd, but also enough there to entertain any board gamer.

This is a kind of sushi-themed 4-player version of a tetris/columns/bejewelled style game. The game has very nice bits, and is quite easy to teach. However, it's not as exciting as I'd like it to be, so it doesn't see much play.

The game is frustrating. Because you can't really plan anything, beyond your first few recipes. You just take advantage of what's open. The game is essentially tic-tac-toe with limited X's and O's and a few other letters. Super simple game that wouldn't be bad at all if it didn't leave you feeling so frustrated.

It felt like I was largely out of control of much of my destiny. Did I get easy or impossible recipe draws? Who happens to want to be placing near what I'm going for? I just felt like my ability to do well or not had almost no relation to my actual play but rather just a function of recipe draws and other people's actions. 

Great production for a meh game.

I've played with several numbers of players and I find it completely and utterly frustrating. I'd rather be "pants" repeatedly by a Mongol horde. Players vie for fulfilling hidden recipes by placing ingredients in rows and columns on the board but the tile laying is chaotic and I've worked and worked to get recipes completed only to have other players switch tiles out from under me or stack on top of tiles I need, or chop out other tiles. The other players aren't being spiteful but in all my games I kept getting hammered one turn before I could complete recipes. Extremely frustrating chaos.

Yuck.

There is not enough control in this game.  By the time it gets back to your turn the board has changed completely, making it nigh impossible to complete any but the smallest recipes.  Perhaps it would be better with only two players, but with four you would be hard-pressed to convince me to play it again.

Although we played a few rules wrong (missed the "with style" points & the fact that we couldn't pick up card type just played unless no other option), I really liked this one and look forward to playing it in future.  My complaints about the game will, I think, be moot when played with all rules in mind.

Played it once and never brought it out again.  It was fun, but ultimately too light for my tastes.  Beautiful components and a fun theme though.  Setup seems a bit tedious, what with sorting all the ingredient tiles.

This is a beautifully presented game that is extremely simple to play, though there are a few holes in the rulebook - for example, it's not made clear if recipies "with style" are valid backwards and forwards, up and down so long as the ingredient order is followed. It plays very quickly, and I'd choose to play it reasonably often as a filler, though it's not something I'd want to play again immediately - this is down to the limited number of choices and repetitiveness of actions which fit the play time nicely, but not much beyond.

I'm limited in my opportunities to play though, as it's not a game I'd take to my gamer group, and because at home, my girlfriend - a committed vegetarian and sometime vegan - feels sick just thinking of all the dead fish flesh. In our last game, we had to stop because playing was making her retch.

Ooh, she'll find any excuse...

Original theme. Simple rules. Great sturdy cardboard pieces. Beautiful artwork.

First play with 2 was a bit so-so. Second play with 3 was a slightly better but still unsatisfying. We found out afterwards we played one rule wrong, so finally played a 3rd game with 3 to see if the game is really so "fillerish" as it seems. It is. Up for trade.

This is a "cute" game that I would be willing to play once in a great while but would never [i]ask[/i] to play. OK, you know what, I don't ever want to play this again, not unless it's strip Wasabi against a hot girl I know I will beat (or who is, for some unfathomable reason, particularly keen to see me sans clothes).

It's an unusual tile-laying/pattern recognition game featuring sushi ingredients. It's easy to explain and moderately hard to play, with lots of combinations to monitor and lots of options on each turn. The special power cards add more options that make game play better, as well.

This is one of those games that I suspect you already know, based on its description, whether you will like it. I expected to think that it was a cute game worth playing but not asking for--and I was sort of right. By sort of, I mean that I was right for a few minutes but then began to hate myself for being so generous with my rating.

Upon reflection, I began to suspect that my rating would drift down toward a 4, but that turned out to be wrong. It went down to 3! After playing again, that's exactly what happened. It just doesn't grab me. It's pattern recognition with a twist, and frankly that's not very exciting. And the theme could be pretty much anything--the fact that it has food on the tiles doesn't make it better for me.

If the fact that you can create an item "with style" excites you, you may be just the sort to appreciate this. My reaction was, "So what?" Another puzzle game dressed up to manufacture the illusion that it's "about" something.

After approx. 8 plays, my wife and I (mid 30s eurogamers with youg kids) consider this game a valuable part of our collection.

The theme is fun, and lends itself to dinner dates w/a gaming tie-in (usually with another couple). The mostly tactical game play does require decisions to be made, but does not require deep concentration for someone to be competitive.

One last note - the German labels on one side of the cards in our Zman edition feature fun-sounding German words like "Scharf!" and "Zerhacken!".  This inevitably leads players to shout exclamations with an exagerated German pronunciation during game play.  (Think Sergeant Schultz for anyone who remembers Hogan's Heroes).

So pretty with such a cool theme it's hard too hate.  However, with a full complement of players it's very chaotic which can lead to frustration.  As you don't know what recipes your opponents are trying to build they can crush your plans accidentally.  The most effective player has the best chance to win but it seems to me they'll also need to be lucky.  I'd like to try this as a 2-player game where it probably shines.

Decent little game.  Great art.  Could be played very friendly or very mean.  Reminds me of a game that could be on par with TTR or Carcassone.  Easy to teach and learn with simple rules, but when played by experienced players the depth and strategy comes out.  I wasn't as impressed as I am with those games though, maybe I am just tired after my first 2 plays and it is late.  Will definately come back to this one.

Wasabi is a lightish enjoyable game for 2 or 3. Of course there is some luck, but I absolutely disagree with those claiming it is only luck. You need to play Wasabi a couple of times to start appreciating the value of the action cards. And getting the right action cards at the right time is absolutely luck-free. Wins are made with the action-cards.

Pozy deal + interesting theme = SUCKER.  This game seemed to have it all, but underneath the cool artwork and pretty wasabi bowls lay...nothing.  Maybe not "nothing," but a pretty light and rather dry tile-laying endeavor.  Playing with 4 or 3 was absolute death, but as a 2 player, this wasn't so bad.  Wasn't going to see much playtime, however, so I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to sell a "hot" game for a tidy sum.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A tile placing games where each player is trying to create a sequence of tiles that matches one of the "recipes" that they have in their hands. The game is very simple, with easy to learn rules and quick turns. Players start the game with three ingredient tiles and three recipes (which specify sequences of tiles that they are trying to obtain; recipes vary in length from 2 to 5 tiles and are secret). On their turn a player has only a few options: to place a tile, possibly play an action card, or pass and get new recipes. If by placing a tile or playing an action card the player has created a sequence of tiles that matches one of their recipe cards, they complete the recipe, score points, and get a replacement recipe.

As all players are playing in the same tile laying space, it is easy to either intentionally or accidentally prevent another player from getting a recipe. Players draw new recipes every time they complete a recipe, so players can't plan too far ahead and must actively use tiles placed by other players.  New ingredients are only drawn when an ingredient tile is placed, so players often only have one or two ingredients in their hand at any given time that are actually useful to them. The game also forces players to create recipes a varying length, which forces players to try to create longer recipes that they otherwise might not want to.

I love the theme and artwork, and mechanics of the game are interesting enough to make me want to play this again. This seems like a great intermediate length game to fill in gaps between big games.

I have only one problem with this game - it always makes me hungry.  Also, I tend to go for the recipes that sound good to me rather than the ones that would allow me to win.  This is a bad strategy.  Note, there are a few rules that we missed the first few plays!  Don't forget that you can't choose rice, maki, or special ingredients in your first hand of starting tiles; and also don't forget that in order to claim a recipe, you have to place the final tile that completes it (no fair claiming other peoples' work!)

As somebody who doesn't even like seafood when it's cooked, I find the theme somewhat repellent.  The game itself isn't bad, but the frustration potential is a bit high, and the player shields/menus should have had USEFUL information on the inside.

Nice theme and well-made. New players should be warned that you need to save some small items for late in the game or else you will get stuck with no special cards and no way to finsih your larger items.

Played this for the first time today with the gf.  I love the theme, the artwork, and the gameplay is definately entertaining with a good mix of luck and strategy.  I think this would be a good gateway game with the friends, as there is enough strategy to be simple and entertaining. I also enjoy the amount of "screw" factor in it. :)  Not a very "deep" game, but is great for what it is.

Bonus that the gf likes it!

I enjoyed this game a lot more than I thought a would. Feels light but with enough strategy to hold my interest and make me think. Fun theme, great components. 

Usually I'll plan to buy anything I rate 8 or better - the 7.8 score reflects how close I am to wanting to purchase this. What may win me over is that this may fill a "game for non-gamers" niche that I like to include in my collection. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There's lack of control when pursuing certain recipes as opponents can unknowingly mess with the set-ups of your ingredients, but this is a quick game and very aesthetically pleasing.

Update: 
I traded it and haven't reacquired it because of the nagging feeling that it is mostly luck-based.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I'm leaving this one unrated, because I have only played it 2-player and am of the opinion that this game SUCKS as a 2 player game. It reminds me of Jambo, although only in feel - not in mechanics. One player drawing the right recipes runs away with the game.

I can, however, see that it could be quite fun as a 3 or 4 player game. With everyone messing with the board the 'right' recipe draw would seem to be mitigated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lay your tiles in a row to create your 2, 3, 4, or 5 ingredient (tile) dishes.  When you finish a recipe and all the tiles (ingredients) are in the correct order, you acquire a special card that allows you to bend the rules a bit.

Mid-way through the game the board gets crowded and everyone starts using ingredients that are on the table already.  The game is hard to plan and strategize for because there are always things getting in the way which makes for a much more tactical game.  It is just OK.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A disappointment, given its somewhat cultish reputation. Low in fundensity as a 4er... it might be worth trying with 3 sometime, to see how the play quality changes when the board opens up and the turns come back more quickly. As it was, the amount of decision-making required each turn (which card to pick, which sushi tile to pick, which recipe to replace, each decision taking about 20-30 seconds) slowed down play. Another negative is in how mistakes compound (unless we missed a rule that you can swap out unwanted recipes). Also, did not realize until the end how much it was, at a broad strategic level, a hand management game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
With a timeframe dictated by a board with very limited space, the questions become going "for style" for the extra point, sprinting through the easy recipes or going for the big ones early.  It's a puzzle game on a more-or-less permanent board, and like Battle Line the end-game slowly emerges... and you're either prepared for it or you aren't.

Also, since so much of the game is focused on completing YOUR goals, the interaction between players gets mostly reduced to unintentional dickery by means of suddenly culling an ingredient on the board in order to get your points scored.

Randy calls this a "hateful" game.  Scott would call this an "I'm sorry..." game.  I call it a challenging game, and I can see the strategies getting better with increased exposure.  But it'll probably only hit the table casually.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very enjoyable and quick game with 2 or 3, but gets a bit too chaotic with 4. My wife loves this game, but she can get a bit hot when any nasty blocking happens!

RATING: 7
Draw tiles to fill recipes. A game that rewards tactics and can be a bit frustrating to more strategic players. Extra points must be given for the wasabi cubes and dishes included. A fun game!

RATING: 8
You have no idea how much my wife likes this game. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's got kind of a spacial awareness aspect to it. You need to keep your eye on what is coming out and where things are, I think that maybe trading in your recipes more often might be worthwhile, since it may be too much work to manipulate the board. Also, it might be good to either get your five out early, or just push a bunch of twos and threes. I can see several strategies working. Not going to buy, but I'd play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and easy to learn with a very mild amount of mindbending strategy.  It won't make your brain hurt, really, but it'll definitely give it an uncomfortable tingle, along with a craving for sushi.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
First impression (4 players): You're trying to build recipies by having rows of ingrediments pictured in recipies. Problem is that you cannot have any idea what other players are trying to build. You can help them accidently with your moves. If there wouldn't be hidden recipies the game would be too deterministic but now it is just silly. It's hard to build recipies by yourself so you must hope that opponents give you some help. Extra annoyance comes from "complete recipe with style" -bonus points that need more luck than skill to be completed. 

Wasabi is good looking (over produced really) abstract game with a paste-on theme. Not a game I'd like to play again although it might be an okeyish two player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A clever little tile placement game with very nice components and theme. Surprisingly strategic. Somewhat prone to analysis paralysis but quite quick anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I don't like this kind of game; I get frustrated by games where I'm trying to make a pattern or achieve a victory condition (in this case, by arranging items on the board) while other people intentionally or, more likely, unintentionally mess with what I'm trying to set up.  For me, this game is an exercise in frustration.

Fiddly as hell, and really only an advanced variant on Connect Four, but there's a simple and pleasurable half-hour to be had here in competitive puzzle-solving. Outstanding theming and presentation is the key to the success here.

I have well over 150 unrecorded plays (a loose estimate that I'm sure is correct), I really have to get better at logging game plays at all games. My win percentage is very high at 2p (I am aggressive and disruptive, really lean on those Wasabi! cards) but not so good at 3 and 4 players where such behaviour usually serves to slow down one opponent while allowing others to proceed freely. Must... adapt... style!

RATING: 6
Gorgeous components, but this is basically "Bingo" with a twist. Not deep enough to warrant lots of concentration, the game still bogs down when people think too long. With the right, friendly group it should be good. It is easy to teach, which is a definite plus.

I've only played it once with 2 players so I'll hold my rating until after I've played it more. It's ok, not super fun but not really boring either. I'm pretty neutral on the game right now.

[b]Wasabi[/b] was sold via auction 4/20/15.
Received in a math trade (1/12/15).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This was a flash in the pan, I loved my first few plays and sought out a copy. The biggest problems was the randomness of the orders you drew. If you spent a turn getting new recipes and they weren't better than the ones you ditched you were a turn behind your opponents with recipes that needed a lot of effort to fill. This lead to a lot of games were one person wasn't competitive at all and soon my family soured on the game. I still think it is a fun game, but with so many family games in our collection this one didn't end up separating itself from the pack. After sitting on the shelf unplayed for a few months I eventually ended up selling it.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent family game that plays great with 2, [i](although the game doesn't feel as cut throat compared to a 3p or 4p game)[/i]. 
- Great artwork, it is very clean, and beautiful components especially the glossy tiles and the bowls used to hold your wasabi cubes.
- Very simple rule set which makes this game a breeze to teach while still offering plenty of depth and strategy.
- Tile laying with a lot of great player interaction, especially with the bonus cards.
- The bonus cards give you the opportunity to manipulate the board state in different ways.
- Recipe management; you can work on three recipes at a time, but you choose from 2, 3, 4 and 5 ingredient recipes. [i]Completing smaller recipes will earn you power cards quickly while the bigger recipes offer much better scoring opportunities.[/i]
- Wasabi cubes, completing recipes "in style" [i](ingredients placed in the order shown on the recipe card)[/i] will earn you bonus points in the form of wasabi cubes (and serve as the tie breaker).[/i]

RATING: 7
Es un juego casual muy entrador. Las reglas son simples y los componentes muy vistosos, con una calidad de producción alemana. Como juego para un público casual, hay que reconocerle que es un producto editorial impecable.

El tema es cuando te ponés a mirarle detalles que le hacen ruido a los jugadores competitivos. Por un lado, tiene un tremendo PAP (potencial análisis parálisis): la información es abierta, las combinaciones poco intuitivas y el escenario muy cambiante. Esto último es particularmente notorio con mayor cantidad de jugadores. Al igual que Carcassonne, con menos jugadores es más cerebral y con más jugadores es más caótico. Realmente es un juego por completo diferente.

Creo que por estos detalles el juego no recibe mejores ratings acá en BGG, pero para llevar a la mesa con personas no-aficionadas, este es un juego que difícilmente te pueda fallar. La temática exótica, apta para todo público y tan bien plasmada en el arte y los componentes, sumada a reglas sencillas y sin excepciones, partidas cortas y una dinámica sólo indirectamente confrontativa (casi siempre perjudicás a alguien, pero sin saber que vas a hacerlo) le dan a este plato todos los condimentos que tiene que tener.

Gorgeous! This is one of the most beautifully produced games! The game play is just ok for 2-players. It's nice to play anyway, once in awhile, but there really isn't much happening in the 2-player game! Now a 3-player game...that plays far better! Things are a bit more intense, the Wasabi card may be used and you might not finish a recipe you have been working on!

Place tiles on a grid to form contiguous orthoganal sets matching the secret requirements in your hand. Score a bonus if they're exactly in order. Introduce some special cards to allow over-placement, switching and the like, and you have a game where your result seems pretty much a product of taking advantage of lucky placements (for you) by other players, and watching players stare at a crowded board looking for inspiration using a special card to help them out. There's some dramatic downtime as a result. Not much reward to be gained on the straight-forward turns either, so this is a game that works but I'm happy to pass on.

What a blast !! Great feel, great components !! A puzzly set collection tile placement game. Fulfill recipe dishes by forming tiles sets on the board grid. The endgame gets challenging as the board fills up.

Though I really like this game, I believe it will frustrate most people because of the constant spoiling-of-plans nature of the game.

Reminds me somehow of the Bejeweled video game.

RATING: 3
"If Augustus is Gamer Bingo, then Wasabi is Gamer Tic-tac-toe. I'm not fond of placement games, and this one has some screwage on top of that. At least it's pretty short."

What I like:
- Fantastic components
- Plays pretty quick (35 minutes for 4p learning game)

What I don't like:
- Not fond of games where you place pieces
- You can only complete a limited number of small recipies
- Sequence of refilling is counter-intuitive
- Both intentional and accidental screwage are possible
- Sushi theme is icky (as a vegetarian)

Basically, you are trying to get "n" in a row. And you have limited abilities to move stuff around as the board fills up. You pretty much have to try for bigger recipes early and smaller ones late, so it feels a bit scripted (if you deviate, you're likely to end up with nothing to do for the last few rounds). It's also a bit of a brain-burner, as you try to figure out the most efficient way to complete your goals.

It's a clever enough game, but definitely not my style. I would put the weight around 2.1, a bit higher than BGG voters. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and light, with great components. Good risk/reward for crafty and bold play, and the ever-shifting nature of the board (especially with the cards being played) keeps things interesting right to the last turn. This one's very popular with the females and, yes, it WILL make you hungry for sushi.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Gorgeously (over?) produced and it started well though, in our first game, we found it started well and then bogged down as we'd not saved enough 2 item recipes so as to be able to cycle the cards. This hung the game somewhat and it became how quickly could 3 of us end it before the 1 player with any small recipes get any more points - which did mean the other 2 were in something of a kingmaking position (I was currently in the lead and so happy to see it end).
Bit chaotic in the first game, I wonder if it would be more useful in the menu cards actually included the ingredients to give players some idea of what to choose - our first game was a bit of 'luck of the draw' as we had no idea of the make-up etc

Very pretty looking game.

But I've two games in now with 4p each and while I can respect the mechanics and the look, it just isn't fun (for me).  Its real easy to get locked into having no choices. Last game someone just filled up space on board to kill the game as had no viable choices or possibility of winning. Can't blame them.

2nd play lowered rating 3 points.

This tile-laying game was a little like Ticket to Ride in that you had to complete a number of random formulas that were worth points based on their difficulty.  However, it's much easier in this game to unintentionally foil the plans of others, making it a little chaotic.  The opponent-determined starting hand thing seemed a little strange: you could get stuck with a worthless ingredient for the entire game, or you could get lucky and get lots of stuff you need.  Also, it may be very easy to block people if you've memorized the larger recipes, particularly the 5-length ones.

TRY Jun/09 - I really enjoyed the 3er game play.
Nice filler.

I did not notice any feeling like Scrabble; no thinking up words/recipes, no trying to use special double/triple spaces.
Nor did it feel solitaire-ish -- we played very in-your-face with the special cards, including a Wasabi to block a 5-item recipe late in the game.

I have tried it at Essen, and I was impressed by the game. Not by the gameplay: it's a good game, but not really exceptional. Judging from the first play, it's a bit light, and there are a lot of games that compete for my attention in that category.

But the components are wonderful. It is one of the best looking game I've seen, especially considering the reasonable price.

One thing is for sure: this game looks awesome! it is highly overproduced and the game would've worked as well as now with less than half of the effort than now there is.
But I won't complain since this just looks so great. Gameplay is a bit weird and a bit too random (the orders) but the special cards help a bit.
With four players I experienced some negative downtime and probably three is the optimum. This was just a guess.

Overall, the game made me think it as the Oregon boardgame which was fun to play. I don't like Oregon at all and there were some similar aspects in this game (probably distant but I got the association) which actually worked well.

And after all, this looks just so great!

Seems like it won't be a go to game for regular gaming, but will do quite well as a gateway game. Needless to say, half the appeal is from the production value.

Beautiful components consolidates the theme but the gameplay feels too busy which I think detracts from any competitive feeling.

Like this, hellova thrift find. Plays well with newer gamers, fast pick up, and my 6y.o. can play as well.
Turns can go long and set up slower than new gamers liked but thought set up not bad compared to Runewars and others.

Played with 2 person game with person already familiar with game-play, still enjoyable, and induces sushi cravings almost immediately.

Far from reinventing the wheel, Wasabi is a good honest game. The material is superb. Z-man games realy did a great job on that one. The game rules and mechanic are easy to understand. This is realy not an analysis paralysis type of game. It can be played by the whole familly. This is realy a spouce approuved game. But has fun has it is, it will never be a great game in my opinion.

Sans réinventer la roue, Wasabi est un bon jeu honnête. Le matériel est superbe, Z-man ayant fait du très bon travail avec ce jeu. Les règles ainsi que la mécanique sont claires et faciles à comprendre. Ce n'est pas un type de jeu qui entraîne la paralysie analytique. Ce jeu peut être joué par toute la famille. C'est un jeu qui saura plaire à votre conjointe. Mais aussi plaisant qu'il puisse être, ce jeu ne sera jamais un jeu qui sort de l'ordinaire selon mon opinion.

Bought this for wife.  She used to really like scrabble (see above) :) and we both enjoy sushi...so why not.

Decent game but didn't want to play much.  Looks great and the power cards mix things up a bit, but never appealed to us as much as other recent (purchased) games.  Setup is a bit of a pain, but not bad if everyone helps.

Update: Traded because we often chose other games before this.

Not my cup of sake. But a good looking game that is easy to get a group to play (my family). I find it odd that both times we've played the difference between the winner and 2nd was only 1 point. This game will definitely get more plays so I will have the opportunity to revise my rating.

I bought Wasabi because the components looked so cool when I browsed the Wasabi photo gallery.  Luckily for me, Wasabi has got a lot more going for it than neon green cubes in adorable little bowls; Wasabi is actually pretty fun to play.  It's neat to plan a recipe path and to try to screw up the other player's recipes while quickly trying to finish recipes.  Because the players can pick whatever ingredients they want rather than drawing them out of a secret draw bag of some sort, players can plan what they want to do rather than merely working with what they've got. Wasabi also has tons of randomness while having very little luck which is a hard balance to strike.  Plus it looks as beautiful in play as it does artfully posed.

Wasabi is a fun, light tile placement game about making sushi. My first couple of plays were less fun - but I'm fairly certain we were playing it wrong. My wife and I recently gave this another go, and we came out both quite liking it. Not sure how it is with 3 and 4, but this is a good 2-player game with minimal interaction. 

Theme is lovely and so incredibly unique.

RATING: 6.4
Nicely produced set collection game driven by tile laying and manipulation mechanisms. Evolves into a pattern recognition puzzle game as the board fills up, and the game slows down as there is more and more information for the players to process. Thematically, I'm don't like that recipes have to be in a straight line on the board. Though it makes sense from a gameplay point of view, it seems like a very "gamey" way of scoring that goes away from everything else that is trying so hard to invoke the theme of the game.

RATING: 5.5
Light and very, very pretty, but quite a pasted on theme on this tile laying game.  I was pretty put off by the randomness of selecting your first three ingredients before seeing anything abut your recipes and the fact that I thus had two garbage ingredients for which I never drew recipes.  I don't see any reason for this clunky randomness.  I'd want to investigate house rules if I were going to play it much more.

EDIT: That randomness is annoying, as is the lack of control in a four-player game.  Any recipe longer than 3 requires multiple moves to pull off, and simply too much can change between turns.  One's ability to predict others' moves is also very limited, so the screwage is largely random.  Possible fixes for me include playing with only 2 or 3 players, allowing multiple special cards to be played per turn, and drawing recipes before ingredients.  Otherwise, I'm afraid it'll just piss me off.

Gorgeous game.  I really appreciate the thought that went into the graphics.  Beyond that, this is a pleasant tile-laying game and is themed to subject matter I don't particularly enjoy, but find fascinating.  Try to build your sequence while hoping that your opponents don't have their sites on your ingredients. 

Note on strategy:  Don't bother with the 5 recipe rolls past half way into the game...  Try to get these out early.

Simple tile laying game with nice components. The players try to set up Sushi recipes by laying ingredients (tiles) in certain order on the board. The ingredients are shared so you can use the tiles already laid on the board. During the turn the player lays a tile, fulfills a recipe (if possible) and replaces the used tiles. In case a recipe was fulfilled the player also received a special action card which for example allows the player to lay more tiles or lay tiles on top of other tiles.

Wasabi! is a theme-packed tile laying abstract.  I normally do not care for abstracts, but this one is done so well with beautiful pieces & theme, you cannot even tell.  Tiles (ingredients) are played on a board as players try to complete horizontal or vertical sequences (recipes) they are holding in their menu.  If they do it in the exact order on the menu, they get bonus points.  Longer sequences=more points, and every completion gains the right to break a rule.  2 players seems to have more of a race feel to get all recipes done, and 3-4 players has more strategy of getting the sequences exactly right for more points.  Both feel "right" and "good", which is a rarity nowadays since 2 player games that have more players tend to bomb; this does not.  This game will see a lot or replay.

Az alacsony osztályzat viszont annak szól, hogy a szépsége ráment arra, hogy a tábla átláthatatlanná válik egy idő után és nagyon magas a szerencse faktora (ebben a játékban nekem ez zavaró volt). Összességében jó játék lehet annak aki éppen most állítja össze a gyűjteményét. Ezzel a játékkal egy könnyed, szép és szórakoztató darabbal bővítheti azt.

It's pretty easy to learn and it's definitely easy on the eyes - ZMan's production on this game is top notch. The little trays and wasabi coloured cubes are a nice touch. I was pretty tired when I played this. I was enjoying the game okay as we started but about halfway through, after being frustrated by the player-induced chaos of ingredients being switched and moved and covered, dashing any plans I'd had - over several turns - to build a certain recipe so that I'd have to start building up to try for another recipe after that - which would once again be fruitless... I was getting pretty frustrated with the game. I'd be willing to try it again, perhaps with fewer players, and at an early time of day when I'd not already been playing games for 11 hours, to see if my opinion of the game improves. It looks so good that I really wanted to like more than I did.

Enjoy it a lot and think it's a good gateway- kinda Scrabble with pictures.  BEAUTIFUL bits and pieces make for some great eye candy.

Fair bit of luck, but not enough to kill it and the hand management makes it fun.

Only problem is that "Wasabi" card - could turn it from a fairly friendly yet competitive game into a really nasty game?  We haven't used it.

Ok but not great with 2 players - but 3p and 4p really good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Perfect implementation of the awesome theme in the wonderful components. The theme and bright color make this the perfect non-gamer game (not gateway game) for introducing to people you think will never like board games, no matter what.

4-player seems a little overly chaotic and frustrating, 3-player seems short and frustrating with the 2 Wasabi! cards on the small board (and scarcity of action cards), while 2-player seems like you can't really pull away from your opponent without luck. Still, I play this game to accommodate non-gamers, and for the experience.

3+2

RATING: 5
Played this a few times with 3 and 4 players. Strangely enough, this reminds me of Scrabble due to the crossword-like nature of gameplay, with ingredients replacing letters. The gameplay is chaotic since other players can unintentionally mess up the one spot where you planned to put an ingredient during your next turn. The action cards add some tactics to the game, but apart from that, you'd better cross your fingers and hope for the best. That said, it's very satisfying when you manage to complete that 5-ingredient recipe with style.

The components are beautiful, but the people I played this with found the vivid graphics on the ingredients headache-inducing after a while, especially later in the game when the board is almost full. The saving graces of this game are its unique theme and relatively quick playing time (~30 mins).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Severely overproduced (in a good way) filler revolving around scoring sushi recipes by playing ingredient tiles on a gridded board to match receipe ingredient sequences.

Harder recipes with more ingredients score more VPs. Toss in hosage from other players, a tight board and special action cards and lots of luck, that's Wasabi for you.

There's too much of a luck factor to make this a stayer on my table.

This game has a great puzzle element to it.  After every move, you'll find yourself examining the board to find what you can do.  I imagine that the competition gets tighter after several plays when all players know a little more about the recipes available.

As for the components, this may be the nicest and most well-constructed game I've ever seen.  The artistic attention to detail and the small touches like the recipe screens add so much to this game.

Very nice abstract tile laying game.  The special powers are fun and aren't too crazy.  There is no significant interaction between players other than chaotic stumbling where in doing what you need to do you may run into another players plans in the dark.  

In some ways this feels more like a Yahoo java puzzle than a board game to me.  These are a good enough distraction, so I appreciate the value.

You assume the role of Sushi chef and try to fulfill menu orders by laying consecutive tiles to fulfill. If you fulfill in the exact order you do it with style and get a wasabi cube for bonus points. There are also some cards which break the mechanics by allowing to stack, switch, eliminate or cover pieces. In the end, I ended up edging out my opponents by one point for the win. I would try again with 4 but I do see some long term lock up problems. One player got caught in a loop where he needed an action card to fulfill an order but could only get the action card he needed by fulfilling one. Not a great scenario.

Wasabi scales nicely from 2 to 4 players with different strategies required to do well. 60 mins to play, even with 4. The family even said they liked it. One minor issue is that familiarity with the recipes could lead to deducing the other players hands leading to a big advantage for experienced players. Congrats to Z-Man for publishing it.

RATING: 7
A fun tile-laying game where you're trying to place tiles onto the board in specific combinations in order to complete recipes (if in the correct order, then "with style" -- bonus VP). Plays quickly but still with plenty of tension as you try to make your combinations while stopping everyone else's. The special powers, and the very nice production, throw an interesting kink into what could otherwise be a very dry game.

The goal is to make different types of sushi! It's quite a fun and humorous game, especially if you play with the right group. I enjoyed it a great deal.

RATING: 6.75
So I've now played five games of Wasabi, and I think that as a light game it does quite well.  It does have one aspect I do not like, however: it seems to me (and those I've played it with) that you can, quite early on, have no meaningful choice, yet you have to keep going through the mechanic of playing pieces and drawing pieces -- which actually seems to help your opponents even MORE, and not get you any further ahead.

Your lack of choices persist, and you basically just wait out the game's conclusion.

Still, it's enjoyable enough, and I think if I'm in the right mood I'll happily play.  I even want to organize a sushi night where we play Wasabi with non-gamer friends.  I think that would go over well.

Wavering between a 7 or 8.  I got absolutely crushed, but I can see how an experienced player can really make things work here.  I love the look of the box, board, and cards. I think you have to make good use of the special cards.  Analyzing all of the possibilities felt a bit overwhelming, but my rating could increase with more plays.

The wife likes this more than I do.  The components and art are second to none.  The depth of gameplay can be as simple as "you do your thing and I'll do mine" or as cutthroat as "I'll break every combo you've got going."  I don't see this as more than filler, but the presentation alone make up for its lack of punch.

This is a preliminary rating. It seemed a bit too much unforgiving, dry, mechanical and lucky. Not for me.

Played again and I really don't like the game. This game depends too much on luck. I'm not talking about luck on the recipes' drawing but how everything gets in the board. It's not possible for a player to control how the board evolves. For somehow I get cut all the time and can't play the game at all. And if something like this happens there's no possibility of a player to change this situation.

This is quite literally a variant of Scrabble.

In Scrabble you position a bunch of letters in a specific order to create a word (and score points).

In Wasabi, you position a bunch of ingredients (in any order you want) to create a recipe (and score points).

Wasabi provides some bonuses that differentiates it from Scrabble:

- It has power-up cards that you can use
- Somewhat high production values to follow the theme of the game: the box actually comes with plates that you can put Wasabi in and everyone gets their own "menu" (just like a real restaurant!)

In my personal opinion, this game causes somewhat kind of an annoyance throughout the game. Your recipes will be constantly bombarded by other players (however you do the same to others as well).

The game does not go further than this however, the game play is quite repetitive after you play it twice - you won't see anything ground-breaking after that.

Decent but a bit repetitive for two.

Unfortunate because this is a very visually appealing game with a good theme and basic idea.

A solid 7 for a game that seems that it would play much better with fewer players.

Overall a positive experience though.

Revised review. I originally gave it an 8 and I loved this game the first time I played it. I thought it was the perfect light game for 4, and would make a great game for new gamers. However I played it again, and the new gamer I introduced it to hated it. I also started to see its limited charms. The next person I introduced it to liked it though, so who knows. It may be that it's not ideal for 2.  
If I had to change something, it seems odd that unfinished recipes don't get subtracted from your score (would encourage everyone to have to attempt their 5-ingredient recipes). Would be fun to have an expansion with more kinds of action cards plus more opportunities to earn cubes for your bowl.

After seeing all the Essen buzz about this new Zman game, I was excited to try a friend's newly acquired copy. I guess the hype hurt this one for me; I was left asking "THIS is what BGG is so abuzz about?" Now, there's nothing wrong with Wasabi. It's a cute little tile-placement game with some good opportunities for messing around with your opponents and trying to convert your opponent's moves into things that work for you. But I was left feeling that a lot of whether my recipes got made or not was due to luck--if my opponents happened to make a similar recipe or accidentally place two pieces together I needed. Maybe after more plays, I'd get better at the game and be able to better recognize what others are doing and how to use it to my advantage. But it just left me feeling a bit unsatisfied, like an appetizer with no main course to follow. Not a bad game by any means, I'm just a bit stumped as to how it got SO MUCH buzz on the Geek. (Though I admit to being in love with the little bowls and wasabi cubes.)

Not terribly original, but surprisingly engaging.  Tactics abound as you can only pray the situation you're working on is still viable when your turn comes back around. The special action cards are very well thought out. I like the fact that a player can *choose* the action card he wants, and that this is open information to all players. The theme is neither here nor there for me, but I'm sure my wife will love it. The components are top notch.

Tile laying game to match your secret missions of adjacent tiles. Special action cards to permit tile swaps, removals, stacking and blocking.

Another game where I was intrigued just by the cover.  I really need to break myself of that habit ...  That said, it's one of the better box covers I've seen.  Sadly, the cover and the interior components seem much better than the game itself.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  I'll give this one another chance or two, but my initial reaction is disappointment.  Playing a second time, I like it a little better, but I'm still not willing to up my rating.  Fun to play once in a while, but not nearly as good a game as it appears to be from the box.

This game is absolutely beautiful...to look at.  To play it is another story.  The rules are easy, but it comes down to having no choices and no control.  All you can do is hope and pray that your pieces stay where you want them and nobody messes with your plan.

A very light game that may work for families.  I'd recommend playing Ticket to Ride instead.

RATING: 7
The object of the game is to complete recipes of varying length by laying ingredient tiles onto the game board. Opponents use the same board resulting in opportunities to use ingredients they have placed for your own recipes and to block their recipes. It's an incredibly simple game in terms of the gameplay but is also deceptively deep in terms of the strategies you can employ and as the board begins to fill with different ingredients an awful amount of thought has to go into finding the best ways to use them and to recognize the options available to you. The production values are of the highest standard and combined with the quite original theme this is certainly an enjoyable enough game.

07 APR 2009 - Played @ GameStorm 11 - After two aborted games at home with the kids, I really wanted to play this with some gamers. I got my chance @ GameStorm and I began to see the real potential here (in fact, bumped it from 7.25 to 8.25 as a result). A bit of a brain burn, wonderful components, lots of tactical play and a bit of strategy. The only luck is in the draw of the recipes (and whatever crap your neighbor gives you at the beginning) because after that you can pick whatever ingredient tiles you want! And (usually) whatever actions you want. The hard part is that someone inevitably messes up your well laid plans.

I don't quite understand the overall score that people at BBG have given to Wasabi! -- wait, I do. It's really hard to explain but there is just something that makes this game rank below avarage. Components vice this is great game, but interaction between players is almost absent. The thing that bothers me the most is the fact that your turn is almost completely about preparing for your turn rather actually Doing someting. Most of the time you just watch what other players do and you don't really have much saying in their doings.

Played twice 3 player (supports 2-4). Beautiful game that is mostly luck of the draw, but the action cards spice up the play a bit, for sure.

Wasabi is probably the most overproduced game of 2008.  At its core, this is Sudoku on a horribly overcrowded board.  If the game were fun, the setup would be worth it, but it's just too much work.  At least it photographs well.

Though I don't mind the 3-4 player game, I think the game is more fun as a 2P game.  With more than 2, the game gets a little out of control, and it can be difficult to implement any kind of strategy.  That said, it is alright.  Most of the appeal comes from the superb presentation, which Wasabi does way over its head.

UPDATE:  Well, after several plays, the superb presentation gave way to merely OK gameplay.  It is a decent game, but not one that was worth keeping around.  I played with 2,3, and 4 players, and the result was always the same:  bland, almost artificial tension, silly dull conflict, and just a hankering to not play again.  Who knows.  

In the end, I ended up trading it for Gunslinger, which is alright by me.

Wasabi! looks gorgeous, but is too chaotic for my tastes. It’s a new tile-laying game from Z-Man games that Simon Hunt was kind enough to teach expertly at BGG.CON. I’ve played it twice with four-players and would like to try it with two or three players to see if it’s less chaotic at those player counts. Seeing as I’m someone who greatly prefers games like Through the Desert, Hey That’s My Fish, Ra, Louis XIV, and China with the minimum number of players, I might like Wasabi! a good deal more with only two players. With four players, too much can happen on the board between your turns, so your ability to exert much control seems minimized. It’s a fairly simple tile-laying game where you try to line up tiles of ingredients to satisfy secret recipe cards, which score points based on the size of the recipe (ranging from two to five ingredients) and score points based on whether you lined up the ingredients in the correct order or not. You basically just play an ingredient tile from behind your screen and then draw back up to three tiles from the open supply. The spice is added to the game with the cards, which you are awarded for completing recipes and which give you special abilities, such as being able to remove an ingredient tile from the board, switch two adjacent ingredient tiles on the board, or play two ingredient tiles onto the board in a single turn. I think the game accomplishes exactly what it sets out to accomplish, and is a good middle-weight tile-laying game with very high production quality, but it’s fairly chaotic with the full complement of players and just like in Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas, your opponents can definitely accidentally interfere with your best laid plans.

Unique (for me) game play.  I'm not sure if it's a game that is too simple or too complex for what it's trying to be.  On one hand the layout and choices of placements for ingredients was quite limited but on the other there are so many ingredients and recipe combinations.  I found my only game frustrating but that was only due to a lack of expereience with it.  Another play would probably improve my opinion of it.

Wasabi! is a light and fast game where you compete against other players to assemble your quota of unique sushi recipes in a rapidly dwindling space. Players draw a variety of delicious ingredients into their hand from the pantry and play them one at a time onto the board, building off of each other's previously-placed ingredients in the attempt to complete recipes of varying difficulty.
Completing a recipe earns you your choice of special actions from the kitchen to perform later (Chop!, Stack!, Switch!, Spicy!, and the dreaded Wasabi!) that will help you in your efforts or disrupt your opponents' carefully arranged creations-in-progress.
Completing a recipe with style will earn you bonus points, but you might not always have the time to set up such stylish maneuvers... balancing speed with technique will be crucial if you plan to win the game!
Victory comes as soon as the board fills up with ingredients. Points for completed recipes plus bonuses are tabulated, and the winner is the player with the most points. An extremely skilled player might score an instant victory by completing their quota of recipes before the board fills up.

I wanted to like this game, but it feels somewhat underdeveloped. It all more or less works, but it's not very exciting, and it seems that the way to do well is to have other players almost complete your recipes for you - which might be possible to arrange on purpose if you've played the game many times, but doesn't seem to be otherwise.

Played only once. Not a bad game but not really a very exciting game either. Things I like about the game : Approachable theme, simple mechanics, short play time and easy to teach. However, there are several things I didn't like : scores are all out in the open. There are no hidden points or scores. We played with the Wasabi cubes out in the open. So, no surprise scoring. This doesn't add to the tension as much. The game turn is also a little fiddly. Placing tiles, scoring, place action cards, more potential scoring, choose action card, choose tile, choose new recipe. I find folks a little impatient on taking turns. Another "meh" game. (Sandy rates it an 6-7).

6/25 - Played two player, a little better with two. Not as chaotic. Still, ratings unchanged.

Dunno. I should maybe try it more, but I never can get myself to try to talk others into giving it a shot. Note: I've only tried it two-player, so maybe it ends up actually being fun in the long run (also read that it's not ideal for 2)

Upon the first play, this wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  The game is beautiful, but I think that there is something about the mechanics with the cards that I didn't like.

I will wait to rate until I've played at least 3 times :-D

I'm not sure that this game holds much water for two players.  It may be the case that the player who draws the recipes with more synergy wins.  That has certainly been my experience recently, which is disappointing because its such a pretty game and I love the theme.

Simple tile-laying and set-forming game. Kitchen tool cards allow repositioning of played tiles for completion of recipes. Relatively quick and light, mostly tactical - the luck of the draw when it comes to recipe cards and the chaos brought about by other players reduces strategic planning to a minimum. Fun unique theme and fantastically produced components.

RATING: 9
An extremely fun, slightly underrated diamond in the rough. It's fast-paced and easy to learn, and has quickly become a favorite of my game nights. I especially enjoy the slight feeling of panic towards the end, as the board fills up. Perhaps the only real downside is that there's nothing to do when it isn't your turn. However, turns tend to go quickly (especially if folks are thinking ahead), so this has never been a problem for me. I always get a strange craving for sushi whenever we play this. I can't imagine why...

Good components for a light little game.  Gameplay is nothing special.  There's positional maneuvering, but this really feels like any of a number of other generic games I've played that are a little bit more honest about their abstract nature.  If this game didn't have the charming Japanese restaurant components, it would be dry as hell.  As it is, it's nice to draw people in, but I really don't think it'll be something that I'm going to care to play consistently, even when considering that it's fairly short.

This is one of the very few games that get a ratings bump soley for theme/components. It is wonderfully themed with fantastic components. However I found the tile laying game rather "meh". But it was clean, played quick and was over all enjoyable.

The spectacular components enhance the theme, and along with the easy to absorb rules make Wasabi a great gateway game. It is particularly exciting to me because I love games with a spatial element. With hidden objectives, it seems interaction is more incidental than meaningful, but I'm not sure this is entirely true- even if you don't know exactly what the other players are going for you can have an idea of what spaces to disrupt. Also knowing that every recipe requires Rice or Maki creates interesting offensive tactics. The game will ultimately sink or swim depending on how well it fares in this regard.

Finally got my wife to play this one.  And as expected, she loved it.  She even asked to play again the following day - a rare occurrence. 

The game-play is pretty simple, randomly draw recipes of different length and try to lay tiles to make those recipes and score points, while at the same time trying to stop your opponent from making their recipes.  Action cards can be used to modify what is already on the board, or how you play your tiles.

While the game play might come off a light and simple, where Wasabi! shines is its theme and components.  This is a beautiful looking game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First up: If you don't like competitive puzzles, don't play this game.  You're essentially trying to match patterns in your hand with patterns on your cards, and you're trying to manipulate the board, the cards, and your tiles in just the right way to make it just perfect.  There's a neat balance, between the way you manage your tiles with your cards, and your tactic for how to approach the game.  There are some downtime issues (which probably make the game better with 3 than 4), but otherwise the game is pretty impressive.

RATING: N/A
Wasabi! is a light and fast game where you compete against other players to assemble your quota of unique sushi recipes in a rapidly dwindling space. Players draw a variety of delicious ingredients into their hand from the pantry and play them one at a time onto the board, building off of each other's previously-placed ingredients in the attempt to complete recipes of varying difficulty.
\13\\13\
Completing a recipe earns you your choice of special actions from the kitchen to perform later (Chop!, Stack!, Switch!, Spicy!, and the dreaded Wasabi!) that will help you in your efforts or disrupt your opponents' carefully arranged creations-in-progress.
\13\\13\
Completing a recipe with style will earn you bonus points, but you might not always have the time to set up such stylish maneuvers... balancing speed with technique will be crucial if you plan to win the game!
\13\\13\
Victory comes as soon as the board fills up with ingredients. Points for completed recipes plus bonuses are tabulated, and the winner is the player with the most points. An extremely skilled player might score an instant victory by completing their quota of recipes before the board fills up.

A nice, light, fun game that probably isn't as much fun if you can't stand sushi.

Played at Great Hall Games with Alex, Harry, and Vincent/Mark. I won 1st game and got 2nd the next.

The game wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be. The components and sushi theme are there in plain view -- a beautiful game to look at. However, under the hood it is largely an abstract pattern matching game. It can work as a filler, but not the main course of a game night.

Beautiful game.  I'm not sure how much I would enjoy this game with a different theme, but as it is, I really like it.  The special actions that you take for completing a recipe add a nice, strategic little wrinkle to the tile laying.  Some seem vastly stronger than others at different stages of the game, however, and when you get your first recipe filled is almost completely luck, so that's a little unfortunate.  Otherwise a nice little game.

RATING: 7.5
This is a solid 7 game with a great theme.  At first I was put off by the theme until I tried the game and found that it fits nicely.  The game plays well but does have some luck in how other players lay out tiles that could affect your options.  Also the draw of the sushi order is a blind draw.  But the game plays fast and the components are great.

But nothing is a guarantee as everyone told me Lost Cities was a can't miss...it missed!

THANK YOU SECRET SANTA 2009 Even she was excited, and lately that is hard to come by,

After 2 plays. There is a lot going on and it takes a while to be able to visualize the board and see what you need to do to set up later plays. Score as often as you can, get the special cards and make some more sushi. Much harder for me than similar games. Not sure why.

This is a very good game made even better by the deliciously beautiful artwork, but it's not a [i]great[/i] game, so it's not going to make it to the top of any "must play" lists anytime soon.  I love the theme, but it can be a major brain-burner once the board starts filling up so AP-prone people can have issues with it.

Also, I suck at it [i](but that's generally a positive thing)[/i] because that keeps it more interesting for me.

We rarely play this, and it seems to have slipped into the [i]"We haven't played Wasabi in a long time so let's... but ooh, we haven't played [some other game] in a long time either, so let's do that one instead!"[/i] slump, so I've slipped my original rating of 8 down a bit to be more accurate.

A number of negative comments about the game from BGG members that I have not seen reflected in anyone I introduce it to.

Makes me want to eat sushi every damn time. Neat game that pretends to have a theme but it's really pretty abstract (that's a minus in my book - Have a theme or don't I say).

What I mean by that is you Play Sushi Ingredients to the mat to make a roll, you score yourself some points and get a special power if you do the roll with [i]Style[/i].. So far so good right? But then what happens? People start moving ingredients around and piling things on top... [i]What? That's my Avocado Inari you're putting Crab on, you bastard!... I was going to eat that...[/i] 

Gameplay wise however, it's great. Lots of fun, pretty strategic, I'm not about to add this to my collection but it isn't a bad game. I'd play it again.

Set collection on a shared board.  Gorgeous bits (a menu and Wasabi bowl for each player is a great touch!) and it can be fun to manipulate the board to complete your recipes... but the degree of planning required vs the random shifts in board position caused by other players can make this an exercise in frustration. 

If you just have to have a Sushi game this is a pretty good one... but there are better shared board tile laying games out there.

RATING: 6
Beautifully produced.  The gameplay for Wasabi! turns out to be quite harsh, albeit unintentionally.  Since everyone utilizes the same ingredients on the board with hidden information, you really have no idea what people need to complete their own recipes.  As a result the game becomes highly chaotic as it progresses and there is no way to plan your moves ahead of time.  Easy to teach and plays fairly quickly.  It's a nice light filler but probably not something I'd want to get out very often.

RATING: 6
A severe rules misinterpretation at the very beginning of the game hampered my experience a bit, but everything thereafter was according to the rules.  Z-Man's components are great, but the game itself didn't quite thrill me.  My biggest gripe is that the people who get the handy special action cards just keep winning more, while those with nothing useful just keep failing more.  I think the wasabi cards are probably a key aspect, and if you don't feel like confrontationally blocking people's builds with them, they will just walk all over your game.

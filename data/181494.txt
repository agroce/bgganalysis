Quite lighter than CV, and it borrows mechanics from other games. Also, it's not a good 2-player game.

RATING: 6
A cute, fast playing, easy to learn game. The theme is pasted on because I never got the sense that I was building a civilization. Nevertheless, it was fun, but with nothing extraordinarily innovative to set it apart from the pack. It's a quick game; so it didn't overstay it's welcome, but with a longer playtime,  I think it would.  I acquired it because of the cheap price ($17), simple rules explanation and as a quick filler or night ender.

RATING: N/A
This game needs 4 players. We started with 3 and it didn't seem like it was going to work. When a fourth sat down, the whole feel changed for the better. This is a light game of action selection with cards where 2 are played per turn... one face up and one face down. It's fine for what it is and also nothing special.

RATING: 3
Ez a játék egy csapás. Bár a mechanikáját nem ismertem fel  teljes egészében másik játékban, mégis rég volt már hogy az első kör befejezése előtt azt vártam, hogy mikor lesz vége a játéknak. Nem kizárt, hogy van akinek ez tetszik, de számomra az újrajátszási faktora is nagyon alacsony. 
A kezdőjátékos teljesen mindegy mit rak, mert úgyis is szétverik a taktikát. Ha pedig utolsó vagy, akkor csak akkor van szerencséd, ha még minden lapod megvan.
Na ez is azon játékok közé tartozik, melyet nem tudnék eladni, mert sajnálnám a vevőt.

RATING: 5
This game did not speak to me at all.  I won't say no to playing it again, but the 5 is for a 'meh'.  I didn't dislike it, but I didn't particularly like it either.  I dunno what it is about this one.  It just didn't work for me.

Between the New York 1901-style of buying stuff and the weird action selection method of face-up/face-down, the game just really felt like it played itself.  Except for the first turn, perhaps, you can simply work with what you already know about what's been played to avoid people messing with your plan.  That being said, we only played a 3p, so maybe this game gets a bit tighter with more players.

It's light enough and fast enough that it's not unwelcome at the table, but it won't be one I request or suggest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are some good ideas here, but the mechanics conflict with each other a bit.  I really like the action-selection because it requires you to predict your opponents' moves.  However, that kind of mechanic is better with more people.  The game also has a shared card market, which is always better with fewer people because otherwise it's very unlikely that you can get the card you want unless you go first.  This is coupled with the fact that the cards are cheap enough that anyone can easily get all the resources they need in one turn, even if they started with nothing.

2015-10-18 : Well designed, quick playing action selection civ lite game with the excellent mechanic of resource gathering based on how many other players select the same action. As half the cards are played face up, it's a game of bluff and double-think that keeps you constantly engaged. And it plays in an hour, so it does what it says on the box.

RATING: 8
I'm not sure the game has sufficient longevity to deserve an 8... If it does fall flat eventually then I'll downgrade it to 7. But for now it'll stay there on this lofty perch.

CVlizations is a game with a confusing name. It also has great artwork, fun action management and a great dollop of fun. All this in a very fast playing package.
The cards might be my favourite thing. The groans and acuusations all around the table when it turns out someone played that third Doubling... great fun.

If there's any downside then it's that after CV I had expected it to kind of... naturally tell a story based on how you build your Civ. And I tried. But couldn't really make it into a coherent whole.
Ah well, so be it.

RATING: N/A
After a video review: It's basically a 3+ player game where you collect resources to buy technologies that gives you special power. It could feel a bit like race for the galaxy, it's a tableau builder.

But even if there are simultaneous "role selection" It looks much more interesting than in race for the galaxy because you can attempt more easily to guess which cards is going to be played. And if you cannot figure it out, it does not seems to be a huge disadvantage.

There is a 2 player variant.

From user comments seems very light, short and the game seems to play by itself.

I was a big fan of CV, but after reading reviews on this one, I put off playing it for a long time. I finally got around to doing so, and I think that I do enjoy CVlizations more. The civilization theme is pasted on, at best, but the card play is interesting. I just wish this came in a much smaller box, as the only reason it's so big is because of the board, which is completely superfluous. Also, I don't think this would be as good with more people. I played this with three, and there were only a couple of instances where everyone chose the same cards three times, thus invalidating that action. With more, I think this would happen far too often. Still, this is an enjoyable enough game for what it is, and even has higher replay value than CV due to not seeing all the cards in every game.

That all being said, while I think this is a good game, I feel like Scoundrel Society does the same thing in a better way.

A fun game to play. I enjoy (and am also frustrated by at times!) the mechanic of guessing your opponents' choices of cards. It's a good introduction to empire-building games, but it's lack of weightiness leaves me feeling as though I've already played it out. I had a good time playing it, but don't feel a strong desire to play again. I would strongly recommend trying the game before buying to see if you can imagine replaying.

A great mix of easy mechanics but good tactical depth.  Has a great streamline out guess your opponent aspect but does it in a unique way as you want only one to join in but more will kill your plans.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Much less snowballing and much less random than the prior CV game.  It's fairly quick but does allow for both strategic and tactical cleverness.  That said, there can be too much randomness in which cards come out and whether you can afford them.  The second-guessing about the double-role selection is interesting (and informed enough to not be random), and the fact that you place some roles face up in turn order adds some interesting signalling.

The era-3 cards are so much better than earlier cards that it is both less important if you miss a buy early but also more critical to get the right infrastructural buys -- there is not 'rush' strategy to counteract the typical arc of getting resources early then turning them into points later.  Nothing beyond the most basic euro strategic arc.  So, it's fine and amusing, but not deeply engaging even as a quick game.

RATING: 7
This is an incredibly light civilization game with a nifty hand management mechanic.  Each round players will play two cards, one face up and one face down.  When everyone has played all cards are revealed and resolved in a numerical order.  You want exactly one other player to play most of the cards.  If you are the only player to play a card usually the effect is weaker and if more than 2 players play it the effect is even weaker or sometimes nothing at all.

Most of the abilities give you resources and you use those resources to  buy technology cards, which is what makes this a civilization game.  The technology cards either improve your abilities or give you points and the player with the most points at the end wins.  You might be wondering what this has to do with CV, the game it shares its name with.  I don't think anything except the artwork.  There are no dice or any other systems that it has in common that I can tell.

The artwork is fun, it's the same as CV if you have seen the cards in that game.  And I like that it is a very light, quick, and accessible game despite having a pretty neat mechanic.

Somewhat fun, (very) light, and (very) fast filler but I  wish it lasted another round.

Provisional rating, one play at Spiel. I liked the "one card up/one down" play of order cards - you have to evaluate the intentions of players both before and after you in turn order. The order cards give you resources to buy idea cards, but this was an anticlimax as it seemed more important each turn to buy whichever idea card one could rather than to save for the hope of better one.  Socha's art is great, as always.

Really like games like this, a bit of bluff, a bit of push your luck, and a bit of screwage.

This was an odd first experience. We played first with 3 and I suspect it requires the full compliment of 5 to strike up a lively session, but even then, I'm not sure the overall dynamic is entertaining enough. Theft is annoying, and ultimately it seems to come down to the timing of cards coming out of the draw and buys. I'm not sure decisions are empowered enough in this just yet, and yet it wasn't so entertaining that I'm leaping at the chance to run it again. That's a problem.

Perhaps the inevitable comparison to the original CV defeats this title, as the original CV is entertaining and raucous in so many ways, no matter what the outcome, but this title seems to lack both the momentum and the thematic relevance of the former.

CV flavor in a light civ building card game. Play two survival actions each round (one hidden). Gain resources based on how many other players match your action (Lowest benefit when all players select the same action). This adds a nice meta element. Some survival actions are interactive to prevent MPS. Spend resources to buy idea cards that provide in game benefits to build engine and generate happiness. These represent the historic chronicles of your civilization through three ages. The last age mostly consists of leverage scoring of the ideas gained from first two ages. Memory advantage to those who remember who played what actions in earlier rounds before replenishing the deck.

Was super disappointed in what came in the box. I feels and plays like a prototype not ready for publishing. We stubbornly eeked out one full play, but it'll probably never be played again.

Card game where you advance technologies trough the ages of your civilization. You score victory points in the end.

There's more thinking in this game than I expected considering how simple it plays. It has a decent number of mechanics lightly thrown in that work well eg bluffing, set collection, drafting, engine building, take that, resource collecting, push your luck and maybe more. 
A bit random but fun.

First impression: OK game, somewhat easy mechanisms with an interesting interaction between players. Allows for some table talk and deal making. More a tactical game. Does feel a bit dry and mechanical.

Fun strategic, resource-management Civilizations card game with a bluffing element. x. It is played in three "ages" of three rounds each. It's from 2-4 players and takes about 45 minutes to play. Each player has a bunch of action cards. Each round two of those are played beginning the current starting player, one face up, the other face down. After each age the action cards are recovered. Once all actions are placed, they are revealed and processed in order: first thieving (from other players), then resource gathering, then cunning (get any resource), then slacking (just makes your people happy - aka VP points), and at last trading. After the actions everyone can use their resources (food, lumber, stone) to buy civilization advances like "Monotheism" or "The Wheel" or "Rocket Fuel". Some of these make for very nice synergy f.e. I had a sword and a knife which made thieving more profitable, plus I also established the law which in turn protected me from other thieves. With my hideout allowing me to play both actions face-down I really scared the other players. In the end whoever has the happiest (most VP) civilization wins. Our game ended with a tie of two, and the other two players not far behind.
 

I enjoyed this game a lot. BUT there is only an English version and so much fun came from "roleplaying" our civ and making fun and puns with the cards. Would totally and immediately buy a German version we could play with our friends.

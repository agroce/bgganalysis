The best tabletop war game I own. If you want fun Hollywood movie style look no further. Amazing artwork, great components and easy to learn gameplay with excellent tactical depth.

Devil Pig Games have created a game mechanic that works perfectly and I can't wait to see what they release next.

RATING: 4
1st play: Similar weight and depth as Conflict of Heros and memoir 44. Iello has the best art of the 3 and the box is filled with customisable things. If you're interested in building your own scenarios this game is great. Lots of ways to approach the game. Biggest drawbacks are that I probably wouldn't want to design my own scenarios and it is designed for 2. Looks like there are 4p rules online, but it seems like an afterthought of fan made tool. The system is solid though either way

2nd play: A hugely expandable system just isn't enough if the core gameplay isn't very fun. Most attacks boil down to 17% or 33% chance to hit, and units just move or attack. The game played smoother the second time, but it just doesn't compare well with Memoir '44 or Conflict of Heroes.

It's okay, I guess, but it's overproduced, a little clunky, harder to play and less fun than advertised, and it's tough to make much headway. Programmed activation of units doesn't help. No coordinated fire. Defense ratings may be too high. Good dice rolls seem to make all the difference.

RATING: 7
Heroes of Normandie is an entry level wargame, with simple and straightforward rules (but without a great rulebook...), but with some depth nevertheless.

The great visual presentation, the sturdy big tokens and the short playtime are all huge benefits in making this the ideal first tactical wargame for the non initiated.

Gameplay is somewhat both classic (counters have basic stats, turns are common with each player activating units in turn) and innovative (there are cards à la Combat Commander, activation tokens, a clever and simple system for building forces), and works smoothly, anyway...

One of the few kickstarters worth its weight!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial Impression: Production values are over the top for this game, with think cardboard and wonderful cartoony art. The game "feels" like a b-rated war movie. Having only played the first scenario, the gameplay seems fast and furious with an orders system lifted from Heroscape. Cardplay is nicely integrated with the main game, without feeling overpowering. Future scenarios promise another layer of interesting decisions with the customization of forces.

I was quite skeptical. I saw the box and thought, "There is no way—NO WAY—that that game is as much fun to play as it looks."

Then I played a few games with a friend's copy and with different players. Every game was different. Every game was like a serious skirmish mixed with an action-comedy war-movie. And no two games played out the same way. (Saving Private Rex is my favorite so far.)

An immense, lavish, easy-to-play game about WWII skirmish combat with plenty of war-movie overtones that _really is_ as much fun to play as it looks! How did they do it??? 

Usually, you do stupid things in this game, you get hurt—just like in real life. But once in a while—thanks to the cards—you might get away with doing something stupid…and it's hilarious! And makes sense from a war-movie/strange-anecdote-of-war perspective.

It's a little bit Heroscape. It's a little bit Combat Commander. It's a little bit Squad Leader. It's much more, in many ways better, and incredibly well-produced.

This game has a lot of detail and it looks like the producers have done their best at every stage to make sure the players have everything they could possibly need for a broad-brush WWII skirmish game set in France. And the available expansions, add-ons, and coming-attractions make this a game to keep your eye on.

Excellent framework/system; very fun, very thematic and making great use of the fact that GUNS KILL (as opposed to a lot of tabletop miniature games where 20+ small dices amount to about 1-2 deaths)

Cover is an invaluable ally; trenches become lifesavers or deathtraps, depending on what kind of weapon the opponent uses; the order system is great fun and allows very tactical decisions; vehicles are neither over- nor under powered; it's just a great game.

I'm just unfortunately not able to play it as often as I'd like to...

A more controlled option for those who like Memoir '44 but dislike the buckets of dice.

Estilo curisoso, heroico y rápido de jugar. Un buen juego para introducir gente al mundillo, pues es sencillo de aprender pero difícil de dominar. Las reglas están bien explicadas y el funcionamiento de las activaciones por cartas es muy efectivo. Sin embargo, no tiene profundidad y las mismas cartas hacen que a veces se convierta en un tedio cuando te faltan las que necesitas para ganar en la mano y turno tras turno no salen.

NOTA: BIEN

The mechanics are spot on and have lead to some very tense, exciting and close fought games.

There are a few typos in the rules and cards but generally the components are very good.  I would have rated this a 10 but i think there is room for improvement with the quality of the parts, that said it is my favourite war-game of the moment, bravo Devil Pig

I like the game because it has a good amount of history, theme, and strategy. You are given one or two squads (infantry, scouts, vehicles, tanks, etc.). and you move through the terrain of Normandy trying to secure objectives. 
I'm intrigued by the strategy. Last night Walker was grouping his men along a road in a tight group. I'm trying to get close enough to hurl grenades at his men. Also I'm trying sneak up behind his tank to hit it from behind where it weaker. Cool huh? 
The problem is that it's also a card driven game. You are given 60 cards. For each scenario you are instructed to seek out a remove certain cards - which is tedious and error-prone. The cards allow you to ignore game constraints. The game is generous with card play - it allows you to play many cards and replace often. 
This throws a random element into the game that takes away from the strategy and realism. Let's say I do a great job of pinning down Walker's main force with suppressing fire. Then I sneak in and hit him from the side and take out his leadership. But then Walker plays a series of cards that allows him to move more spaces and ignore terrain obstacles. I can out-play him and easily lose. What's the point of developing all of the game rules that simulate tactical battle but then allows you to ignore the rules randomly?
Our first two scenarios were a bust. I won with lucky card play. Walker won with lucky card play. Yesterday we started our 3rd game. I was able to disable his tank (which could have wreaked havoc on me) by simply playing a card.
I'm worried this game sucks. Maybe I should start a thread on BGG to see if I'm missing something.

"Suck on this, Fritz" snarled Sgt Clint, ripping the grenade pin out with the shattered fragments of his teeth. The grenade arced gracefully towards the Puma armoured car, rolling between the wheels almost as if some higher power had rolled a 6 on a die somewhere. The Puma stopped, traversing its MG turret towards Clint and then exploded in a brilliant orange flame that illuminated the pretty French cottage behind it, but sadly not any French peasant girls in the bedroom. 

-

In the summer of 1994, aged 12, I packed up a game that had dominated the previous 4 years or so of my life until then. This was in part a response to an employee of the company involved informing me that I could not have the rules for the use of a unit I'd just bought unless I also purchased the army rulebook that it belonged to. I got a refund for the purchased unit, turned on my heels and never went near the game again. 

Unsurprisingly, the store was Games Workshop and the game was Warhammer FB. I never ever thought I would return to a miniatures game, indeed I sneered at the very thought. 

Then I picked up HoN on the cheap from a stall at a show. It sat unopened for some weeks until curiosity got the better of me. Dodgy translations are a real bugbear of mine but I battled through it, in part because I'd gotten it cheap. What I found, to my astonishment, is one of the best and most accessible non-Eurogames I've ever played. 

Everything - *everything* - that the player needs to make an informed decision about his forces is on the boards or counters. There are no CRTs and no preposterous DRMs, just pure rolling where everyone knows the outcome immediately.

The production is of a sky high quality. I really,really mean that. It's gorgeous. The colours are sharp and clear, the icons are obvious yet not intrusive and the cards are of good stock. The cards are not always crystal-clear in their application but a few minutes commonsense will usually suffice.

The deformable battlefields with the optional buildings, trenches and terrain features are just wonderful. The whole package is just wonderful and my friends and I have genuinely had more fun with this than almost anything else in the past 2 years. 

It's so good, in fact, that I can forgive Devil Pig issuing a rulebook that refers to concepts and components that aren't included in the base game. I'm opposed to DLC in videogaming as the concept has been thoroughly bastardised. However I'm more ambiguous about this in boardgames as I accept that base unit price is important, as is a realistic box size.

It is, as others have declared, a miniatures game sans the minis. For that I'm grateful, partly because I've never gotten over the GW experience and partly because they'd need to be painted and I'm awful - truly awful - at that.  

Yeah I liked it. Lots. Although I'll never touch a Games Workshop product again (Fantasy Flight Games stuff notwithstanding). Buy! Play! Enjoy! Unless, natch, you're a French peasant girl in which case get out of my dreams and into the cottage.

-

The hatch of the burning Puma sprang open, smoke billowing from within. A blackened figure, coughing and gasping threw himself out and over the side, his arms wide and above his head. Sgt Clint unshouldered his Thompson in the same fluid movement as he closed his grenade pouch. "Eat lead, Fritz" was his mutter as the Tommy chattered. The German  coughed, sighed and keeled over as Clint turned away and lit a cigarette. 

"CUT!" screamed the director. "We can't have war crimes!"
"No war crime here," spat Clint. "This is Hollywood."

"Isn't it? "

Own the demo game.

Based on the demo game:
Cards when printed were not aligned front and back. Rules are brief with minor hits and miss, but did the job well. I had some doubts but I think I got it straight by common sense.

I'm no experienced wargamer (I own CoH and CC: Europe; but so far have only played CoH, couple of scenarios), but I think Heroes of Normandie has a great system. It's simple (beginners like me can understand) but still offers tactical decision. This is just the demo version, I'm sure the real game offers plenty more.

Maps uses grids rather than hexes. Although this seems limited, the blocking (LoS), movements (units may move diagonally), and terrain effects do work/function well in this game. There are some helpful symbols on the map to show what terrains do. It sure is helpful to me, but maybe not to grognards (as they like charts to refer to the terrains IMO; well I like charts too). 

However, the demo rulebook didn't touch about any facing rule. I'm guessing there is no facing rule in the game as the map grid and units are squares rather than hexes.

The use of grenades and it's effect on grid maps is great, for me at least. It targets what they call as crosspoint (the mid section of 4 squares joined together) rather than targeting a square. I don't know any other game to compare this style to.

There was no vehicle in the demo game but I'm guessing the movement works the same way as normal units. Except that vehicles may remain diagonally on the map (of course, or else it would be awkward for vehicles to only move and stay within straight lines)(based on a picture here on BGG).

Cinematic and flexible, this system will yield many, many plays for years to come.  It's pretty easy to explain to new players.  The one problem is its newness.  Still some kinks to work out in the rules and distribution of orders, but that should work itself out over time and another version or two of the rulebook.

I love it. Simple and Fun. Only grip is I wish there a deeper campaign system for tabletop that used positions in a theater to pick your battles and available units.

The game itself looks Hollywood and some parts of it are geared towards heroic behaviour, but there's a serious wargame core lurking beneath the shine. The unit activation puts hardcore wargames like ASL to shame and the way they managed to differentiate between the P-38, P-51 and P-48 in next to no rules is sheer design genius. And this is just one of the little design choices that make you go "hum, there's more serious wargame to this than at first blush"

Imagine playing one of the C&C games and having to put the cards you want to play in an ordered stack each turn. Does that take thoughtful skill? Sure, but is it fun? Or perhaps more specifically: what’s more fun, the idea of making the effort to put those cards in order each turn or having the ability to play your cards whenever you like? This game says it’s more fun to plan it all out than dynamically react. 

And I’m out right there, but then the game decides it’d be even more fun to layer in some powerful card effects that very well may negate the effort you just made to  plan it all out, i.e., ‘"... until contact with the enemy" and all that. So a lot of my effort was wasted and I'm supposed to find that fun because [i]war is hell, man.[/i]

The cherry on the parfait is the fact that there is no opportunity fire such that machine guns are rendered far too ineffective. I’d go so far as to say they’re the weakest units on the board. If you don’t have an opp fire card in hand when someone strolls by your machine gun, well, you’re helpless (and the gun is costly to pack up and move). 

The result for me is a truly discordant experience that can’t decide if it wants to be a thinky chess-like wargame or a beer-and-pretzels laugher. Having the gameplay flow tilted decidedly towards planning yet having cards undo that planning feels like a bunch of false choices taking up my mental energy (i.e., illusion of depth).

Played two games.  Both felt like skirmishes, and with a touch too much luck concerning the 'power ups' you can pick up.  I like more realism, and Band of Brothers or Combat Commander deliver without too much more complexity.

I really like this game. It is a quick, light and easy wargame - but not a simulator. If you want high level of realism or detailed micron management, this is not a game for you.
Included is a system to generate or build your own scenarios which is a must, in my view, for this types of games.

Excellent theme (WW2 Hollywood films)

Don't love how the cards add enough luck to make the game feel "swingy." I think I like playing without the cards best.

Best and most clear units stats system I've ever seen

Nice and short, great intro for new gamers and kids (good alternative to Memoir '44 as a lite/intro wargame)

I like the PC version too.

It does what it says on the box... Hollywood war movie of a wargame. High on fun, low on 'realism', (whatever that means when we equate moving cardboard counter around in a board to actual warfare). At least these guys don't BS about it being a simulation. Think Kelly's Heroes, Cross of Iron and Fury. Not for the gamer who feels a game is broken if it doesn't take at least four M4s to take on a Tiger 

Scenarios are well balanced and interesting. Artwork On the counters and boards is excellent, artwork in the rule book and recruitment tiles is cartoonish but well done and fun.

Fabulously supported with expansions and capable of randomized encounters or do it yourself scenarios. 

Rules got somewhat bitty with all of the expansions but the upcoming compendium shoul consolidate them.

I'd love to see Eastern Front. 

9 stars because it does what it sets out to do fantastically well.

per ora ho giocato una decina di partite a HoN, alcune per imparare le regole e per decifrare i vari pittogrammi che costellano pedine e mappe, altre per spiegare il gioco ai miei amici wargamer, altre ancora per testare gli scenari e la mia comprensione delle tattiche.
Quindi la mia recensione è parziale, ma per ora posso affermare che HoN è un ottimo gioco sui combattimenti tattici della seconda guerra mondiale (sia per i neogiocatori che per i grognards), anche se una meccanica di gioco e alcune scelte dei designers non sono coerenti e sbilanciano inutilmente il gioco.
Vi spiego perché, in maniera diffusa.

Innanzitutto Hon è un progetto di gioco basato sulla grafica: tutto, dalle pedine al terreno, alle regole speciali che si applicano ai veicoli, alle armi pesanti, etc, hanno un rappresentazione diretta sulla pedina/effetto del terreno. 
Non c'è bisogno di consultare tabelle di nessun tipo. 
HoN è un gioco tattico, ogni pedina rappresenta una squadra di fanteria (anche un ufficiale, un eroe o un'arma pesante), un singolo veicolo o un pezzo di artiglieria.
Ogni quadrato delle mappe geomorfiche copre un'area di poco meno di 10 metri. Questi elementi sono combinati in formazioni (plotoni) che combattono per la conquista di obiettivi tattici (solitamente edifici) o per il raggiungimento di una missione (solitamente la cattura di qualcosa e/o la sua distruzione). I plotoni hanno una formazione base (normalmente 4 pedine) con un costo in punti definito (50-70 punti). A questa dotazione possono essere abbinati, spendendo punti, altre unità, armamenti addizionali, caratteristiche psicologiche e assetti (missioni di artiglieria, missioni aeree, etc.).
Fin qui, niente di nuovo: i giocatori di Bolt Action, di Warhammer 40k, di Flames of war si muovono su terreno amico. La novità consiste nel "come" il processo di costruzione dell'esercito avviene. Non si scrive nulla, né si consultano elenchi infiniti per costruire la lista perfetta: ogni reparto può essere costituito al massimo da quattro scelte, più quella di base. 
Le scelte sono delle pedine che fisicamente devono combaciare/essere adeguatamente colorate con/nelle le slot disponibili in un telaio che possiede ogni formazione di base. Sulle pedine di formazione sono stampate anche il livello di perdite che è necessario conseguire per concede all'avversario un numero di punti vittoria. 
Semplice, brillante e unico.
la sequenza di gioco è articolata su tre fasi: la fase degli ordini, quella delle azioni e quella delle riserve.
nella prima i giocatori posizionano dei cubetti di legno con un numero sulle pedine che agiranno nella fase successiva. Il numero di cubetti a disposizione dei giocatori dipende dal numero di punti comando che hanno a disposizione e cioè da quanti ufficiali si trovano ancora in gioco (a sua volta questo dipende da quante formazioni  lo scenario mette a disposizione dei giocatori). Normalmente 1 ufficiale fornisce 2 punti comando. 
I cubetti hanno un valore numerico che indica la priorità di azione della pedina (1, 2, 3...) durante la fase di azione. Le pedine del campo con l'iniziativa agiscono per prime. L'iniziativa viene determinata dallo scenario o da un lancio di dado all'inizio della partita e si alterna con il passare dei turni (se vince l'americano il tiro d'iniziativa, la sua pedina 1 agirà per prima nel primo turno dello scenario; la pedina 1 tedesca agirà per prima nel secondo turno e così via). 
A variare la sequenza di attivazione e a modificare un po' tutto il corso del gioco interviene un mazzo di carte (minimo 40 per giocatore) che i contendenti creano all'inizio della partita. 
Ad ogni turno i giocatori possono giocare tutte le carte che posseggono (una mano di 4 carte), che viene "riempita" nuovamente durante la fase delle riserve.
Durante la fase delle azioni le pedine possono essere mosse, sparare o assaltare. Ogni azione ESCLUDE l'altra, tranne nel caso in cui il gioco di una carta permetta di agire diversamente.
Senza dilungarmi in dettagli, basti sapere che la risoluzione del tiro (e anche del corpo a corpo) segue un principio semplicissimo: si somma al lancio di 1d6 il valore di armamento della pedina che spara (il fuoco di più pedine amiche NON può essere combinato) ed eventuali modificatori concessi dal gioco delle carte. Se questo valore è pari o superiore al valore difensivo della pedina bersaglio (modificato dal terreno, dal gioco delle carte, dal terreno che si frappone, etc.) l'unità subisce una perdita (che può essere salvata solo se si gioca una carta apposita).
L'azione di movimento (identica all'azione d'assalto) può essere soggetta al fuoco d'opportunità dell'avversario e dalle restrizioni imposte dalla presenza di una ZOC che circonda tutte le unità di fanteria che NON hanno subito risultati di disruption. 
Nella fase finale del turno TUTTE le pedine che non hanno ricevuto un ordine possono muovere, SENZA ALCUNA RESTRIZIONE NE' rischio (in questa fase non è permesso il fuoco di opportunità) e vengono svolte una serie di azioni amministrative (riduzione degli effetti della distruption, riempimento della mano di carte, etc.).
Una partita a 100 punti (poco più di un plotone per parte) dura solitamente 6 turni e si gioca in meno di un'ora.
Una partita a 500 punti (una compagnia rinforzata, solitamente con mezzi corazzati) 8 turni, per un tempo di gioco di circa 2,5 ore.
La prima critica, quella più seria, muove da questa considerazione: gli scenari di attacco difesa sono sbilanciati in termini di punti perché il difensore normalmente tiene degli obbiettivi difficili da prendere (case, bunker e simili). Lo sbilanciamento non si riflette però sul piano tattico (quanto è difficile prendere l'obbiettivo, compensato dalle risorse a disposizione) ma nella differenza di capacità di comando. 
Normalmente l'attaccante ha più formazioni a disposizione e questo gli concede un vantaggio in termini di coordinazione perché ha più unità che possono muovere e sparare durante la fase delle azioni e questo è perfettamente accettabile.
A mio avviso non lo è più se questa maggior efficienza si riflette anche nella fase delle riserve. 
Più formazioni a disposizione vuol dire più unità a disposizione, ma non più bersagli per il difensore e questo è sbagliato.
Un altro neo, minore a mio avviso ma significativo, è rappresentato dalla sostanziale invulnerabilità delle unità che si trovano all'interno degli edifici o, peggio, a bordo dei veicoli. Le armi pesanti possono distruggere un edificio o un veicolo ma non danneggiano i passeggeri (mentre in caso di crollo di un edificio gli occupanti devono effettuare un test).
Altro neo, concedere agli occupanti di una posizione migliorata il fuoco d'opportunità automatico e non agli occupanti di un bunker. 
Ultimo neo, l'acquisto delle carte d'artiglieria/aviazione e la loro frequenza nel mazzo ne rendono del tutto sconsigliabile l'acquisto (può aver senso per il tedesco, non ne ha alcuno per l'americano).
Bene, a tutti e quattro questi problemi è possibile ovviare con una semplice house rule... cosa che ho già provveduto a fare e il gioco funziona molto meglio.
Quindi, perché HoN merita un 8? 
Perché è un gioco divertente (gioco delle carte e decisioni da prendere ad ogni turno) e coerente rispetto alla scala di gioco (funziona sia con poche pedine che con molte unità per parte), perché è semplice da spiegare (sia ai giocatori esperti che ai principianti), perché è straordinario sul piano dell'impiego della grafica (semplifica tutte le attività di gioco), perché la semi simultaneità del turno obbliga a compiere scelte tattiche sensate e perché la sua semplicità di accesso (su tutti i piani, compreso quello logistico e degli organici) non va a scapito della profondità di gioco.
HoN NON è ASL semplificato (non diciamo sciocchezze), NON è Memoir '44 complicato (non è un gioco semplicemente di carte), NON è Combat Commander (che non ha i mezzi corazzati e ha un format fisso di una sola mappa). E' un esperimento, per ora riuscito, di coniugare l'appeal del gioco di miniature con l'indiscutibile efficacia del boardgame.
Non è una simulazione? dato il suo punto di vista lo è molto di più di altri giochi, maggiormente "titolati".
Non è esente da difetti, come avete letto, ma nulla che non possa essere modificato in 5 minuti di riflessioni.

RATING: 8
Light skirmish with extremely tactile components and cool art.
So far, the card play feels a little too sync'ed to each other, creating: I counter a counter of your counter, situations quite often. Thus it can become over dominant during  attack outcomes. But that is mainly where the: take that! wild moments are born. so can't complain too much. Scenarios have not been that inspiring so far. Maybe the drafting will offer better engagements.
However it is a cinematic knock about WW2 fest, a fun light game, and pretty art too.

This is a very fun game to play.  The rules are simple, but the players will have to make many tough decisions each game turn.  The order mechanic and card play really add to the tension in the game.  Visually the game is a treat and the production value is high.  The game is only slightly marred by a less than stellar English translation of the rules.  If you can read French, keep the original French rules handy.  Recommended.

Rather lightish, gaudy, action paced 2 player WW2 wargame.
It plays very quick, has some fog of war incorporated concerning the move & fire orders 
and an artwork that makes it even palatable for players that would usually shy away from
board games with a war theme.
For me personally the scope is to light. If i play a 2 player war game i want the heavy stuff.
Some of the rules seem a bit unthematic, you can pass enemies without them
doing anything about it. Also, because of the broad strokes you shouldn't mind a hefty
ammount of luck.

Un buen wargame *jugable* de escala táctica que pudiera servir como puerta de entrada al mundillo. En pocas palabras es un juego de "miniaturas sin miniaturas" en el que las armas son bastante letales, al contrario que en otros wargames con miniaturas en el que tiras más de 20 dados y sólo hay 1-2 impactos.

Su mejor punto fuerte es que tienes todos los datos e información en las fichas y el tablero, sin existir apenas necesidad de revisar el reglamento una y otra vez. No hay tablas de ataque aéreo, artillería, supresión... Esto hace un juego muy ágil, y jugado sin cartas, con buen nivel de profundidad y de capas de decisiones.

PROS: El grafismo y la calidad de los componentes son muy elevados. Incluye un generador de escenarios. Aunque las unidades se desplazan por cuadros en vez de hexágonos, esto ofrece 8 posibilidades de movimiento en vez de 6. Cumple con mis expectativas de jugador: sencillo y entretenido (no valoro un wargame por lo difícil de jugar sino por lo bien que lo paso jugando). Muy táctico por el terreno y la personalización de tus unidades.

CONS: Pocos escenarios históricos. Pocos escenarios para más de 2 jugadores (esto me limita poder jugarlo con mis dos hijos a la vez). Poca rejugabilidad de un mismo escenario.

En realidad no es un juego, sino un sistema, lo que le convierte en carne de expansión. Al haber dados, quizá las buenas tiradas determinen quien gana. Además de los dados,  aumenta la aleatoriedad gracias a un mazo de cartas que, como puedes jugar todas las que quieras, se reemplazan con frecuencia, provocando que haya muuuchas jugadas inesperadas y efectos fuera de tu control. Las unidades sólo pueden mover o atacar, sin haber más opciones como las de moral o rally. Por último, las oportunidades de acertar suelen ser reducidas (17-33%)

I was never even tempted to play a war game until I saw this in a game store. I was intrigued by the artwork, the modular boards, and the tiles. After researching the game later I ordered a copy.

High quality components, excellent graphic design, easy to learn and play, and the cards make the game loads of fun. There can be some tense and exciting game play!

It's one of my favorite games right now.

[Edit: I'm considering a house rule whereby a commander gives a +1 die roll bonus to each adjacent infantry unit (I read it somewhere else and I like the idea and the rationale behind it). I'll report back here if I try that.]

After looking at the cost of investment for miniature-based wargames (buying rule set, miniatures, paints, time, etc.), I started thinking that it would be fantastic to just have a wargame that used cardboard components. They'd be cheap to produce and purchase, and I could have a vast set of them (and it wouldn't take up much space). Then I found out this game exists! After buying the core set, I very quickly started ordering more army components to provide options. The core set gets you off to a good start, but some of the campaigns in it are lack-luster. It doesn't break the game or anything, but you'll likely enjoy just using the included scenario generator.

Probably my favorite game. I have D-Day, St. Mere, Gazette 5 (worth it for the included poster map), german reinforcements, wittman's tigers.  I love the variety in making different scenarios.

Yet another tactical game playing in the WW2 end of the pool.  Heroes of Normandie is much more on the game end of the spectrum, with a simple activation system and fairly bloody combat.

25th Aug 14 - Really quite enjoying this one. Light wargame, probably a step up from Memoir 44. Great top down graphics. Rules queries tend to abound because of translation from French to English but the rules tend to be intuitive too. Scenarios fun and reasonably quick. I've played CC:Europe, White Star Rising, Band of Heroes, Band of [something else], Panzer 44, Conflict of Heroes, etc, so far I'm enjoying this one the most.

Combat is fast and furious, assault rules are easy to understand, vehicle movement and rules easy. Cards add cool effects.

Downside - a little too simple for those who like more realism ala Combat Commander, etc.

Upside - I like more simple. I'm tired of tedious rules and long playtimes.

I enjoyed the precursor to this game, called Frontiers which was a sci-fi based version of Normandie. But this game seemed a bit too dumbed-down. It was too simple, and much too random. The game really boils down to who got better dice rolls. Tactics never really seemed to play a huge part.

This game is fairly similar to M44 in terms of weight (i.e. very light). But while M44 might be a pain to set-up, I think I prefer the 3D element to it.

A miniatures game without miniatures, Heroes of Normandie is a fast-paced WW2 strategy wargame inspired by Hollywood war movies. A tactical scale board-game opposing two players and two armies, with the Germans on one side and the Americans on the other. Players use order tokens to determine initiative and to bluff. While a single six-sided die determines combat, action cards are played to spice things up. Secretly plan your attacks and outwit your opponent. Block the opposing strategy and surprise the enemies. Deploy your units and don't turn back!

I would like to play more before I decide if the dice rolling and RNG spoil an otherwise good game. Good Ameritrash.

2nd Play: Game feels extremely RNG-heavy, to the point that the entire outcome of the match, for otherwise evenly-skilled players, comes down to dice rolls. Very unsatisfying for series strategy gamers. Trading away.

Fun introductory war game. The rules leave a bit to be desired, but gameplay is generally quick and intuitive. The units are varied and present a lot of options. The board is the best in the genre, providing all the terrain information without having to look up charts or cards. The included scenarios are diverse and fun, but the real fun comes in building custom armies and skirmishes. The point system to add skills, equipment and heroes is great fun.

This is a fun, relatively fast past war game.  Some of the rules can be a bit confusing due to poor translation from French.  There is also a lot of luck involved, but I feel it adds to the realism of the game (In combat you often miss far more than you hit.  No matter what anyone tells you).  My wife even likes this game on occasion.  Though it is likely because she destroyed me the first time we played it.

So close to Memoir '44 that I'm surprised iEllo doesn't get in legal trouble over this. Unlike Memoir, however, you have a lot more freedom when it comes to moving units around the battlefield. In this way, the battles feel a bit more realistic. Still, it's a light war game, and games of this nature usually don't rate very highly for me.

RATING: 7.5
Have modified my view and subsequent rating of this rather unique game. I have left the original review in square brackets below so you can all sneer, jeer and leer at me.

In fact it's pretty good fun. The difficulties arise from treating this like a squad game such as ATS or Lock n Load. It IS NOT a squad game. Things happen really fast in Heroes of Normandie. A whole scenario would probably be three of four minutes of screen time were it transducted to film action. a few guys poke through a hedge. Three are cut down by a machine gun. One man darts forward and throws a grenade while a tank bears down on him. Bang! It goes up in flames and enemy soldiers move by a house in reaction. within moments most are dead but not before they cut down the assaulting troops' commanding officer. The GIs crowd around the body of their dead leader and one lights a cigarette. They agree war is hell. End of scene.



[I was drawn to this like a child staring through a toyshop window and now wish I had saved my money. The game is stodgy, over-produced both visually and in all the wrong rule areas. Underneath the bells and whistles this is as dull as dishwater.

And yes, I have tried it out - played about ten scenarios from the book and DYO - and found all of them meaningless wastes of time. 

The force building procedure is time-consuming and finicky and overladen with options which could be represented more abstractly - especially as firing rifle grenades, firing panzerfausts etc add nothing much to the gameplay which is so turgid it's beyond redemption. 

I hate saying horrid things about someone's endeavour and I appreciate others rate this game highly, but I feel strongly about this as it represents a new low in wargame design. I was appalled at what a vapid experience playing this actually was.]

This just doesn't do anything for me, I'm afraid. I don't think the game introduces anything new or different or exciting. For light and fluffy I've got M44 which is so much quicker to play. And for a squad level wargame, Combat Commander: Europe is as easy to pick up as this one but with much more depth and without the clumsy, beer coaster-size tokens.

Really glad I backed the Kickstarter for this, even though it took 13 months to arrive from payment and even though I am not a fan of Kickstarter.
Fast and intuitive game system with fantastic quality components.

Probably too light for hardcore wargamers, but a very good crossover game.

Probably one of the best playable squad level world war two games (i.e. compared to something like Advanced Squad Leader, which seems too hard to play, and with ugly components). Heroes of Normandie has great components and great artwork. The rules can be a bit fiddly, with a lot of exceptions, but the icons and graphic layout makes it pretty easy to remember them. Needs more scenarios.

super fun, however, that darn instruction booklet is atrocious. It just sucks when your learning the game and because all the different units  affect each other in different ways it just leaves so many grey areas that need a 300 FAQ book.

RATING: 4
What's the aim of this game? Introductary WWII tactical? No, even M44 does a better job at that. Squares instead of hexes? So my fellows run faster diagonally than in a straight line? Come on! Extremely busy countergraphics - so many details, you sometimes don't see what's on the counter. A limited quantity of fire orders, the rest is movement. 

So basically there are some good ideas in that game. The frames that are customizable with your units. The iconology is actually very good and intuitive. Good card art. The game is - in it's essence - very simple and easy to learn (if you'd have a rulebook that would support that). 

The scenarios (I played 3 of them: Godsend, Plain Carnage and Slaughterhouse) are not really good and the replay value is even more bad.

Overall game play is disappointing. The game draws heavily from the movie Kelly's Heroes, but in fact, I'd rather watch this movie again than playing that game again. The card play is the most stupid part of the game - look at Combat Commander to see how this should be done properly. Setup and counter storage is extremely fiddly. Yuk. The games makes the impression of "overproduced". Sometimes the units die like flies and the battlefield is emptied quickly. No morale/rally. And a really lousy rulebook.
Pity, I wanted to like it. :soblue:

Played the 1st Scenario. A bit too complex to really be an introductory wargame and a little too light to be a 'classical' wargame. The limitations on orders and the cards that 'assist' (not drive) the game add a measure of strategy with luck to give an entertaining and replayable game.

I expect to play the more involved scenarios soon.

RATING: 10
This game is definitely a 10.  I don't compare it to other squad based war games because that is like comparing apples to oranges.  If a war game is intensely difficult that doesn't make it better or worse.  It would have to be evaluated based on how well it plays on a intensely difficult concept.

HON is not difficult to play.  It is intense though.  But the genius of this game is in the game play.  

The brilliance of how they constructed the counters with all the information on them.  The graphics are off the chart.  The map boards are robust and supper attractive.  The additional map overlays are too.  The units are beautiful and really give you a feel for what it is.  The size is perfect.  Using square hexes is not a problem because you can move diagonally which gives you 8 ways to move instead of the hexagon style which gives you 6.  

The ability to create your own scenarios is unlimited.  The extra counter types that simulate all the components used in a battle are here. That is off the chart.  

What this game does is instead of having rules for all of these war components, they put them in a counter.

As I started out this review of HON, I said it would be apples to oranges to compare to other squad based games. By that understanding, the rules are simple.  I play a lot of squad based games and I find myself looking at the rules wondering where is the complexity to implement the game.  There are no charts of different levels of suppression and hits.  No complicated artillery charts, airplane charts, tank charts, nothing like that.  This game is so simple, it can be taught with minimum look up (because most of the info is on the counters), in about 10 minutes.

Yet it is just as deep in strategy.  It is just the kill factors are quick.  Roll a die, add in your bonus which is on the counter, use your bonus of cards if any, compare it to the defense and cover of the defender, your done. You want to suppress, double your counter bonus, your done.  Most counters can take 2 hits, some 1.  Move on.

I play mostly solitaire, and it is great.  Instead of assigning orders as outlined in the rules, I just take the amount of activation's and play them as I go. No bluffing though.  A few cards won't apply but no big deal.
Other than that, very easy to do solitaire.  Just play both sides the best you can.  Even the concealed concepts are easy to do.  Oh yeah try to forget some of the cards or at least play them like you don't know if the other side has them.  Players will know what I mean.

The genius of this game, and I wished I designed it, is the game play, counters, graphics, scenarios and development of them, fun factor, expand ability (that's how they addict us and make more money), variety of things to have with all the extra's, ability to house rule it, and simplicity of execution.

For those reasons a 10 is well earned.

The components are great, though I could actually do without the cartoon look of leaders and heroes. I love the fact that all abilities are shown right in the large size counters had the Baird even though there are so many options that it is not easy to remember the meaning of all icons. The rules certainly could have been written better. I have acquired many of the expansions, especially the larger ones, and can play nearly forever. Decided to make that my WW2 tactical board game even though, especially given the scale, it's definitely more about having a fun game than simulating anything. Perhaps a very large game (8+ map boards) would allow to recreate some historical situations.

This is a beautiful and very fun game. I enjoy playing it and encourage anyone to try it!

However, I'm rating it a 1 for the publisher's utter failure in quality control. Publishing a rule book with a page in the WRONG LANGUAGE is simply ridiculous and most of the game and its expansions' errata really reflect the same type of proofreading failure. Devil Pig Games has a community of fans who I'm sure would be more than happy to proofread their materials before they are sent to the printer.

- The rulebook is clear, if full of lots of typos and obvious minor errors.
- The graphic layout is superb; readable, memorable, concise.
- The gameplay sounds good in theory, but is utterly forgettable in practice.
- The lengthy scenario book is great, but setting up a scenario (removing all the right cards and finding the exactly right tokens amongst a sea of similar looking chits) takes waaay too long compared to the length of an actual match.
- The customization templates are a really neat idea, but paired with a point cost it just becomes an annoying puzzle to spend your points.  I'd have preferred they double down on the jigsaw-style unit customization and use side to balance value.  Even as is, most units are very close in cost.
- The order token mechanism is great (as is basically everything borrowed from Heroscape) but doesn't save the game.  It's also very high variance, given how flimsy the units are, so there is a high chance of getting ruined because of a few high variance bad rolls followed by not getting to take any turns.  Heroscape did it better.

Also, why is a halftrack so much flimsier than a squad of 3-4 infantry?  But that is the least of my complaints -- I don't mind unrealistically flimsy light vehicles if they play a tactical role in an interesting game.

All in all, this game confuses 'light' with 'shallow' and uses the first to excuse the second.  It's not terrible, just forgettable.

1 play, Origins 2015

This is a pretty complex game! Fortunately, the production and design seem to be very good (possibly excepting the rule book?) so it should be relatively easy to learn. Relatively -- it's no M44! I'd like to try it again, although at first glance I think I might prefer Combat Commander and Conflict of Heroes for something slightly heavier but still in my reach, or M44 for a quickie? This reminds me more of a miniatures game, and I'm not really a fan of those (unless maybe they're very light, like Heroscape).

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
This is a scenario based game, with each one being set up differently with a unique set of units and/or objectives. There are different versions of infantry, armor, etc. After the initial set up, players assign their three order tokens, as well as a Bluff token, to four units. Then, starting with the player who has initiative that round, players each activate their number 1 unit, then number 2, then 3. Activating allows you to move and/or fire. As usual, you have to deal with line of sight and terrain modifiers as well as unit-specific factors. Fortunately, all that information is on both the board and the unit tiles themselves. Players also start the game with several cards in hand, which may be played during various phases of the game. They have a wide variety of effects, modifying the basic rules or giving you additional powers. You may use multiple cards if appropriate on the same turn. After the three activations, players are allowed to move all their remaining unordered units (no combat). Then, discard any cards you don't want and draw back up to your hand limit (4). 

As units are killed, you allocate them to specific discard areas. Eventually, you will start to lose your command blocks, decreasing your ability to issue orders. There are also ways to get additional blocks -- if present on the board for that scenario.

You proceed this way until one player achieves the scenario objective and wins the game. Or, if you reach the end of the scenario (turn limit), the player with more kills wins? Or maybe it's defined in the scenario?

A kickstarter that looked so much fun, I went all in. Spent well over $100 on it. Played it twice and realized I don't much like wargames, and this one not at all. One quest was about finding someones dog. Not particularly interesting or fun.

A fun game that plays fast and is deeper than in looks on first glance. If you can get through the terribly written and poorly organized rule book, your effort will be rewarded.

Sehr schlechte Regelerklärung. Gutes Kampfsystem - besseres Kampfsystem als Memoir 44, aber weniger komplex/ weniger Entscheidungen. Memoir 44 bietet mehr Variation und leichter zu erlernen.

Just need someone to play this with. I love the idea and the art work. The scenarios are cool and reminiscent of war films like Kelly's Heroes. They've done a great job of meshing a little humour into what is not a very humorous subject.

Really did not like this game nor the art. For me the rulebook was a mess and interested itself it seems more on a cool delivery than detailed explanation. Very popular system with others, but I sold it off.

Beats having boxes of minis to store. Playing instructions are a bit crowded and not logically presented. 

Components are durable and game plays easily and is quickly  set up after one deciphers the rules. 

Might rise among the crowded ranks in my WWII collection.

Kickstarter'd this, and was surprised by how much STUFF there was - game, boards, extra punch boards, extra boxes.

The quality of the art is great, and the game system works really well.  Not overwhelmingly complex to get the basics, but with oodles of room for strategy and trying things out.

Rated 9, initially - which is unusual with something that obviously has typos and printing errors (less 3% of tiles is the figure being quoted) - but none have 'broken the game' thus far, and with so many tokens (600+) it's not a huge issue.  Designers have been very very responsive on forums (both their own and here) to clear up ambiguities in rules, and appear committed to allow players to enjoy the game.

By now i have only the first scenario under my belt, but i'm hooked.
This is really a fine game of ww2 tactical combat, think of Memoir '44 on steroids. Perfect blend of simple, intuitive mechanics but deep and challenging to play.
Army tiles, the orders mechanic and the customization options is where this game really shines
I found it more appealing to rookies than Conflict of Heroes series. 
Components are beautiful and high quality despite some typos

I give it a solid 8 bound to rise when i've tried some of the overwhelming option that this game systems seems to offer.

Update: if my Squad Leader nostalgic friend and wargame mate after playing 2 scenarios says "Mmm... this game is really good!" it truly deserves a 9!

"Destitute" is about the only way I can properly describe such a wretchedly translated rule book and scenario guide. No one should have to go on an Internet scavenger hunt just to set up the god damn introductory scenario. How did Iello greenlight such mistranslated rubbish?

Still trying to decide how much different this is than something like Conflict of Heroes, other than the tactical scale is larger.  I like the simplicity and the activation reminds me of Heroscape.  Either way, I fully backed the KS as I find it graphically fantastic.

The first few times I played this game I loved it.  It is a strong, light, war game.  Most of the situations are pretty intuitive and the board/token are very well designed, in my opinion.  But the poor rule book is increasingly frustrating.  It is organized poorly, has several grammatical (translation) errors, and key things often seem to be omitted.  There is an unofficial rulebook that most people use as a replacement, but I still find even that book to be lacking.

Two player WWII war game with modular board and terrain tiles. Scenarios setup takes some time to adjust the decks and spend point limits on your units. This game does a great job using iconology on the tiles and board to minimize having to lookup the dreaded rules exceptions. The destroyed side of terrain tiles visually adds to the theme while dealing with obstacle and line of sight. I don't remember another game that has a wounded side for unit tiles using icons to remind of their weakened powers. The overlay is also new to me for building customizable units--very cool. Activate orders and bluffs in numbered token order. Straight forward dice combat except I don't recall a game that uses the best of x rolled dice upgrade. The meat of the game is managing your hand and card play. I'd be surprised if this game doesn't catch on.  Neat to see the evolution of war game design and game mechanics in this one. Tons of customization.

I really like this game.  I always wanted a game that was more squad/unit based, as Risk and Axis and Allies were the only 'war games' people played in my social circle.  

This game does a wonderful job of representing the military structure without over complicating.  I really enjoy the customization options, expansions, and that the tokens and the terrain elements have the critical data marked on them.

My only complaint are the rules.  The organization of the rule book does not make it a great for quick referencing.  They are not hard to understand, but there are a some holes in them that leave it open to interpretation.  I am looking forward to the completely revised rule book from their recent kickstarter.

Way simplified version of a traditional war game.  I love it and it kind of scratches the ASL itch when you only have a hour for gaming.  the scenarios are fun but not all are balanced.

This game is a great starter for transition from board games to miniatures... the perfect hybrid.  Anyone in the Peel (GTA) area that would like a demo, let me know.  I will be running demos as soon as my KS product arrives.  Initial shipment arrived so there is enough to do demos.  Rest of product still to come.

Plays much like a collectible card game and certainly evokes the theme of Doctor Who, this game is surprisingly complete and professional. Quite enjoyable and finishes fast enough to want 'just one more game'. I really like it.

RATING: 6.5
+ Theme comes through the cards very well; game play is straightforward while still allowing for some significant decision-making.
- Combat resolution feels a bit too simplistic.

Joyful, thematic, asymmetrical storytelling game that remains exquisitely balanced despite multiple victory conditions. Uniting classic and new Who, the stories produced during play linger in the memory long after the games are over. Outstanding.

I'm a huge Doctor Who fan, so I couldn't pass this one up, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well this plays.

I really appreciate the effort that went into this!

This game is fantastic. I had never heard of it before I got it (for my birthday!), but I have wanted to play it non-stop since I got it. It feels a little slanted towards the Doctor, but not incredibly so. I still win with the Master a fair amount of the time.

It doesn't feel wrong that it is slanted that way either, since the Doctor does always come out on top! Love this game and all of the expansions.

I love the background effort of this game but the way it is structured is weird and at times the rules are confusing or just nonexplainitory it was ok except for its greatest flaw the Master can win :0

Despite this being a fan-made product, I'd say it's much better than many offical games out there. The rules are fairly easy, but the game is quite deep and very immersive. Especially if for a Doctor Who fan. You won't regret it!

Plus it plays well on its own even without knowing any of the characters. Who would've thought?

The Doctor and The Master battle over three worlds using cards that have 3 values: a cost to play, a combat effect and a special ability. The special abilities are mostly simple 'Take that!' style effects, but the game can be resolved in a number of ways: running out of cards, planetary destruction or killing all incarnations of your opponent's character. Each game seems to play out differently depending on the order that the cards come out and that's a good thing. Provided you accept that this is a fan-created game and don't expect it to be the next Dominion or Race for the Galaxy, then it works well and is comfortably worth the $30 it costs from Artscow.

I suppose most people who actually own and play this, do it for the theme. And it is there in several aspects. Going through the different regenartions and struggling over several time lines is cool and makes sense and the effects of some card really match up nicely. Other cards just tell you to do some stuff without much of a thematic connection. But overall mechanisms and theme form a nice package which makes it a pretty good and quite enjoyable game for Whovians.

Seems to favor The Master but the game oozes theme and is fun enough. My 12 year son likes it and is willing to play so that gives this game at least a 7.

I really enjoy this game! Can be a bit fiddly to teach to newbies but I love the variety of cards and the novel mechanics! Each game has played differently so far.

The only disappointment for me is knowing that it'll not get picked up and printed professionally due to the licensing issues and massive amount of rework. So it makes me glad I know the designer and am able to pick up a copy that way (although I'd recommend anyone check out the Artscow links and get themselves a copy!)

I've played this a few times, having only recently acquired it.
I like the tie in with Doctor Who and am unsure if I would like the game as much as I do if it did not use this theme.

It's a fun game and I do like the multiple victory conditions, always a different way to win

I had this printed out a few years ago, and I've enjoyed it immensely. My son and I (he's ten, and pretty brilliant at games) have been playing this recently. He's not a huge Doctor Who fan, but he's seen and read enough to appreciate the theme. He always plays as the Master, which is the more active side, and we're both having a great time. Thanks!

This is really the best print and play game I've played and also the best Doctor Who game as well. I have the second regeneration version (with all the expansions too) and the artwork is really super... it really helps you get into the game. Gameplay is pretty simple -- you play either the Doctor or the Master. In either role, you're using your hand to force regenerations and hoping your opponent will run out their deck since if they can't draw you win. Mechanics are pretty easy to pick up, but you have great decisions throughout the game since you have to pay for cards you use by discarding others from your hand. Each game is different since you don't see every card every time-- due to a "disruption" mechanic, which makes you discard cards off the top of your deck. I enjoyed our first play and expect this will see a good amount of time on the table since we are Doctor Who fans. This is definitely a game you'll enjoy more if you're a fan on the show (it's fun seeing all the companions and villains from the current series and the ones I remember from my childhood.)

Artscow decks.  Never used.  Includes all expansions.  All backs are the same.  This means some cards need to be placed back to back.  This does not affect game play as these cards are open knowledge.

A bit too dependent on luck.  The right card draws can totally crush an opponent.  Had two recent games where I was beaten using methods that there was simply no way to block -- e.g. hammering my Doctor incarnations with one "kill a companion" card after another, followed by cards that brought those attack cards back from his discard pile.

More playtesting and a bit of rebalancing, and this could be a great game.

Magnificently thematic asymmetrical card game with a good amount of depth and a wonderful back and forth dynamic. It plays quickly and the rules are simple to understand, yet it never feels trivial or dull and expansions add additional depth and options. Any Doctor Who fan should make the (small) effort required to print this game out from artscow or printerstudio. You won't regret it.

Just here as a place holder (at some point in time, Megan may want to get Tony, to play a game with her).

Doctors of cheese, travel through pseudo time, poised to give Sci-Fi a bad name... EX-TER-MI-NATED! Ugh, can't stand it. This franchise is the worst thing to happen to Sci-Fi since well, the Syfy channel.

Also: Defeats the fun of Print and Play, having to buy the cards from Artscow (but also costs a small fortune to print and sleeve them at home). With 200+ cards, what's the difference whether they're collectible or not?

[Artscow decks] Without the Doctor Who theme this would be just an okay card game (published as Invaders), but the theme is so wonderfully integrated that it adds +2 to rating even for a casual Whovian. 8/10 with expansions ('Bigger on the inside' deck).

Not a bad game, and quite good for something PNP.  Both sides play really differently, which makes it a lot of fun. As a magic player, not having instants or counters makes the game seem lest robust, but I enjoy it nevertheless.

Hello, fellow Whovian! Thank you for taking the time to discover my game.

Why I think you might like this game:

1. Twelve Doctors (TD) deals with the Who Universe in a completely different way than all the other games that have tackled the sprawling subject matter. This is not a game about collecting VPs, or completing dusty objectives in museums, or about ferrying mythical objects from one far-flung planet to the next. TD is a game about thwarting the Master and destroying his minions.
2. TD is a fast-paced Who game.
3. The Master player gets to do really cool things: destroy planets, start interstellar wars, mesmerise the Doctor's companions, use death-dealing gizmos, deploy forcefields, and invade Nexus points with all of the coolest villainy from around Muttar's Spiral.
4. The Doctor has all the gadgets and assistants that you would expect from a decent Who-game. Plus he's able to drop temporal marauders into black holes, or give them a slap with Venusian Aikido, or give them a serious headache with the Hand of Omega.
5. All of the iconic villains appear amongst the cards (not every card is a Dalek or Cyberman).
6. A great deal of the Doctor's assistants make an appearance. Not all, but most.
7. The game is drawn from the entire run - not just the current iteration of Who. So you will see the Axos from Seeds of Doom, the Wirrn from Arc in Space, Kroll from The Power of Kroll, etc. I think you get the idea.
8. All of the Doctors can play a part. Even Paul McGann.
9. The game is designed by someone that has read about 50+ Dr. Who Target paperbacks, played and run a huge number of Who adventures using the FASA RPG, and is a MASSIVE Tom Baker fan. I also quite like Matt Smith.

RATING: 5
Control areas to get cubes in three colours. After the style of Knizia your smallest set of cubes is your score. There are also nods to Civilization (the method for eliminating units down to an area's capacity) and El Grande (the action cards).  Sadly, this set of classy influences seems to add up to less than the sum of its parts.  The pacing of the game seems off; sometimes there just isn't a lot to go after and at others cards or a lack of pieces leave you choosing weak alternatives to playing a card. Added to that, some of the cards are awfully swingy.

The artwork is pretty drab, though some of the cartoon images are amusing. Production quality is good. The rules are a bit wordy.

Plays over three years.  We stopped after 1 1/2 rounds and 2 1/2 hours.  Game should have been trimmed at that length as there was no story arch.  Just repetition of same process.  Colonisation interestingly handled and card play, a little Wallensteinish, led to some interesting combats.  Politically insensitive and not a subject that will suit everyone.

A wonderfully evil game of area control and timing. The theme hides nothing about what it is. You are killing natives and ransacking their countries of their natural resources, much as the colonial countries did. It's a heavy theme that starts a few conversations, but the game itself is fairly abstractly presented (at least, on the board).

Another Spielworxx game that I enjoy and glad that I acquired. It has an El Grande area majority mechanic type feel to it along with a Knizia's Tigris and Euphrates end game scoring.  

There is an abundance of player interaction, bluffing, card management and tactical/strategical play.

It takes a few games to grok the strategies, but it rewards the effort.

Rules wise, this is not a heavy game. The heaviness comes in the brain-burning decisions and trying to see far enough ahead in order to not only do well, but to not screw yourself. This game has a lot of chaos from other players. The game state can change pretty drastically from one player's turn to the next. Normally, this is not such a problem, but here players often place cards that won't take effect until the end of a particular phase of the game. Because of the effort and AP caused by this game, the enjoyment just does not reward enough for me. I liken it to Dominant Species and Vanuatu in the sense that there is chaos and drastic changes in the game state. 

I'd play it again, but I will never recommend it.

Interesting game that, in my opinion, needed more time in development. One of the cards has the potential to break the game and is not fun (this is not sour grapes, I won by breaking the game and did not enjoy it). Also the board can stall at times with nothing very interesting to do as there's frequently a dearth of cubes out. Not worth the length, not a great game.

RATING: 4
For what is essentially a sequence of 6 rounds of semi-blind bidding for area majorities Colonialism takes quite a bit too much time. It gets repetitive fairly quickly, and the fiddly upkeep doesn't help (not to mention the obtuse iconography) even though the rules are really quite simple.

Just imagine something like El Grande, except you don't know how much influence your opponents will be able to place or where they will place it. The action cards that make up the bulk of the game are really swingy, causing a lot of chaos for little gain.

Don't play this game. It is an example of what happens when you take mechanisms from other games that are good then ruin them. This game is focused on logistics but adds in the randomness of cards. It's also not fun at all. Instead play King of Siam, Tigris/euphrates, or some other area control game.

Colonialism is a card-driven, area majority game in the vein of El Grande played with the Konig & Intriguant expansion. As everyone has access to the same cards and you can see what cards your opponents have played before, you may be able to mitigate some of the brutality of the take-that. It's also a game that deserves credit for being an area majority game that works well for two, as the NP natives create a third-party antagonist. The last positive point about game-play is the way scoring is based on your lowest resource collected. Thus, scores are often single digits.

Component-wise, there's something about the way the drab grays and browns of this game's map piques my interest. It's a bit like a faded map you might find framed in an antique store. The other component to crow about is the beautiful card art. The art is in the style of political cartoons from the 19th century. 

There are a few negatives, of course. Starting with the least problematic, the sequencing of how a Colonization Phase works can be tricky and necessitates referencing the rule book or having a player aid. Secondly, the cards do make the game a bit swingy but if everyone knows that going in and doesn't AP too much, the game can move along fairly quickly and the swinginess won't matter. Finally, and most damning, the theme of plundering Africa, the Middle East, and Asia while "taking care" of the natives is incredibly callous. This forces me to carefully consider who I bring this game out with.

It is an abstract game of area control. The natives give the gamne a very smart element, because you can actually prohibit your oponent from getting recources by not intervene in the battle, because now he has to eleminate the native influence all alone.

April '15-  We liked it much better than expected!  Got some of the rules wrong, mainly regarding the need for active ships for end-of-turn chain cards.  Some tough choices to make.

Players blindly play cards to bid for influence in regions. Once strengths in a region are revealed, colonial powers collectively fight the natives, and if successful the strongest colonial power steals that region's resources. 

I think the blind aspect of the game really works here. Players aren't secretly assigning all of their moves, a la Wallenstein, instead they're playing them one at a time, perhaps bluffing but nontheless providing information. Cards played down along with position of fleets, often needed to enter a region, provide a sense of what opponent's are attempting to accomplish. There are also some action cards that come into play and size limits in regions making timing very important. All in all a solid, often tense majority influence game.

Note: These comments reflect an early version.

Printed and assembled.  One incomplete solo play and two complete 2p games.  Nice to see an area control game with conflict that still works well as a two player game.  The card decks and card drawing need some tweaking but the game is almost fully realized and turned out well.  The event cards could add a nice touch.

After first reading the rules, I figured this one would be fairly dry and boring as you only had 5 actions to chose from and most you ignored. After playing it though, I was rather impressed with how well the area control worked and how the card play resolved. It's a bit procedural at times, but I really liked how combat resolved. It was similar/identical to how Civilization dealt with conflict.

I will say though, this game desperately needed a player aid to help break down what to do after each Colonization phase and End of Turn sequence. The icons weren't sufficient and it's not easy to remember the ordering of things.

Not sure this game is higher than a 7. I like how dark the theme is even though it feels pretty euro-y. It also plays surprisingly well with 2. I worry 4 players might take just a tad too long and think 3 players is probably the sweet spot.

One of the worst games I've played. Unneccesarely brutal and pretty much impossible to win without good draw luck. If don't draw your add 4/5/7 card until the end you're pretty much screwed. Has both serious "Runaway leader" and "Left behind loser" problems.

Pros:
+ Works very well for 2 players
+ Tight, highly interactive
+ Original mechanics: set collection for scoring & fighting against natives
+ I would call this game: "Shogun for 2-4 players", because of somewhat similar feeling: most actions are programmed + moving around the board is expensive

Drawbacks:
- Quite long - short variant takes 2+h
- Many little details in rules, lack of player aid

In this game, players represent colonial powers plundering the world for it's resources. The trick is that each region has a native population that needs to be quashed first. The game has a fascinating secret card play mechanism where the first action card that players play into a region gets placed face down, but all additional cards are faceup for everyone to see, so you hide some moves, or bluff outright, but overcommitting means people can see your plans and react accordingly. When a region has more influence disks than it's capacity, players remove disks 1 at a time, starting with the player who has the fewest. If after enough disks are removed, the natives are gone, then the remaining players divide the resource cubes from that region. At the end of the game you score for whichever of the three colored cubes you have the least of. 

One nuisance is needing to count how many disks will get removed during each removal phase, but it's a minor quibble.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional
:star: Clever or interesting mechanisms

--Apr2016-- Insofar as I was able to dissociate myself from the "pillage the colonies" subtext of the game (the side-comments about whether King Leopold was the [i]worst ever[/i] was perhaps indicative of where we were going) it was quite entertaining.  I'd likely play again happily.  But I'm not sure I could recommend it with a clear conscience.

No one knew the rules to this going into our first play. It had the appearance of being a serious, thoughtful game and perhaps that is what lead to some taking their time analyzing their options. Had we made that 90 minute window, the experience would've been great, but as it was shot well over, to around the three hour mark, with going through the rules. It'd be simple to pick up again, and certainly reading the cards took time, but the game invites painstaking analysis. It looks great though and the gameplay was evocative. Want to try again.

This solid and well designed game grabs nice merchanics from several other games. It reminds me a bit of a hybrid of "Byzantium", "El Grande" and "King of Siam". The long and sometimes a bit chewy playing time is not always full of suspension but there are tough decisions and not little interaction. A lot of players feel disturbed because of the artwork ... I like this muddy board and the thematically drawn caricatures.

Positive is that influence counting is not straight forward and new player in a region may become a significant change factor. That is really good. 
I like the colors and style of graphics of the game, though I do not feel like a colonial power (that's good).
Main problem is the total time of gameplay - about 3 hours for 4 players. Way too much, even though there is a little of downtime. 
Positive is also that the gameplay time includes the rules explanation, and the fact that there were little and minor mistakes made.

This is an area control game with some incredibly convoluted rules and some really ugly components.

I feel often times that in an attempt to make a game fresh and original designers only succeed at making a game overly complicated and convoluted.  This is one of those times.  The area control elements of this game have you first navigate a ship into an adjacent water area, place a number of influence disks in an area by "spending" that ship to play cards, then alternate removing different faction disks until that area gets to under its total allowed influence in that area.  THEN the player with the most influence gets to collect one of the cubes in the area, followed by the second most influential, etc.  Finally, scoring at the end of the game is done Knizia/Tigris and Euphrates-style, based on the color cube you have the least of.  And that's the whole game.

This is really just very simple area control accomplished through a web of convoluted steps but you still get to the same place as any other area control game.  Not to mention the cards that you use to take most of the actions in this game are not that interesting.  They just place influence in one way or another or move the cubes about so you can collect the ones you need most.

And god is this game ugly.  For one I'm sick and tired of the different shades of tan and brown that too many recent games I've played come in.  It's ugly and sleep-inducing.  Nothing about a palette of dull browns catches the eye on a shelf or makes me want to play a game.  There is no easy distinction where the sea zones you can place ships are but this is just another stupid convoluted rule anyway.  And finally the propaganda-style art, also without any color, on all the cards ranges from disturbing to hideous.

I found pretty much nothing redeeming about this game.  I will admit that I didn't finish my first play (I would have, we were in a game store and they were closing) but every round plays out exactly the same so I didn't miss anything either.

Only one play. Area majority game with some good ideas. I like the theme but the feeling is somehow a bit dry and off. The ability to grow doesn't change much during the game as you're performing the same action all the time. I would rather want a game that allowed me to perform a better action at some point during the game.

DIY version played 4-player... Nice system that is easy and fast to play. It's area majority to get first pick of resources, and cards restrict choice of how presence is added. Conflict resolution and naval abstraction are slick. I think the game may be too short or something; the winning score in my game was 3, with one player having 0. (Scores might be higher with the secret mission cards that I didn't make or use because I'm not sure what is on them.) Need to try again.

Theme is kind of weird. It's supposed to be 19th century imperialism, but the focus is on resource collection (seems anachronistic) and the most valuable region on the board is the Middle East not including Egypt, which would mainly be the Ottoman Empire. India and China are up for grabs as well, but each is worth less than SE Asia. This takes some imagination to explain. I'm not sure if Egypt is included or considered at all: North Africa is the least valuable region on the board and actually was never visited in my game.

...One thought I had was that maybe the scoring should give partial credit for the second-poorest score. It just seemed to me that players' hands were often tied, as far as what they could do to get ahead.

...I'm also thinking that there isn't enough variety in the effects of the cards to be worth implementing them that way. I think I'll get around to trying some variants.

...Something curious/surprising in the interaction in that the need for a particular resource can suggest a very specific course of action, determining which players I butt heads with. It doesn't feel very political/negotiation-based.

...Playing again during the KS I'm docking it by 0.5... The card-based system seems like a fiddly way of creating uncertainty/tension via hidden information (regarding how much presence each player is dropping into a region). And if you take this out, the theme still makes no sense, which warrants, I think, even more simplification. Since all you care about is grabbing specific goods that may appear, and not for maintaining colonial presence, maybe this would be better as a pirate-themed game.

Colonialism is an elegant and refreshingly cynical take on... colonialism of course! Players use their boats to sail around and stake their claim in various colonies from the Middle East to China. The players with the most influence will get first dibs on the spoils, but only after all the natives have been "eliminated", LOL!

The game is fun: there's that bit of hidden information that prevents the conflicts from feeling deterministic.  

The artwork on the cards is amazing (ironic, given how drab the board looks).

UPDATE: After a handful of plays, I want to like the game more than I actually do. Colonialism has originality in spades, but unfortunately is just too long for what it is. I also feel like some tweaks are in order, such as removing the Military Campaign card and perhaps doing away with the hidden endgame goal cards, which seem to reduce rather than amplify the decision-space. In sum, the game nearly misses greatness, but it's still unique enough that I'll get it to the table once in a while.

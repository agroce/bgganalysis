RATING: 7
A daft, silly, dexterity game for children to play with their parents.

It's not easy to manoeuvre the flying carpets around and someone always seems to throw doubles really quickly when it's your turn - thus stopping you from going any further.

Quite an original game.  You've got to give a lot of Kudos for an idea like that!

RATING: 7
Rating is for playing with children.  Would rate this 6 for playing with adults only.  This is one where adults can play with kids and not have to handicap themselves.  This is a fast paced exciting game, it is not a game that involves a lot of strategy or thinking.  

The excitement comes from one person using the blower to move their person as fast as they can while another person is rolling dice as fast as they can to try to force the end of their turn.  For me, one of the most amusing parts is to try to distract the die roller and gain a few precious seconds of time blowing your carpet around before they realize they should be rolling the dice.  No significant difference in play as you move from 2 to 4 players other than the play getting a little more chaotic as you try to distract the person rolling the dice as you start puffing.  

Plays equally well with 2-4

RATING: 7
A neat semi-dexterity game.
The plot of the game is slightly dry (collecting merchandise from stalls).  The interesting part of this game is the action portion where you are moving your "flying carpet" by using a bellows to provide "puffs" of air to move your device around the board.  This is a highly satisfying experience and the adrenaline will last beyond the end of the game.

Very funny game for kids, but it needs some practising. If they have not the right handling it could become frustrating for them. Once they have found the trick, the fun of the game can really begin.

Memory meets dexterity.  The kids like this one for the bulb syringe used to move the magic carpets.  The problem is, younger kids (my 5 y.o. and I've read similar comments from others) really seem to have trouble using the bulb syringe.  Very nice components as expected from Haba.  I'm not really a fan of this game, but my kids enjoy it.

Make your flying carpets move around the board by blowing them with a bulb syringe, racing your left-hand neighbor who rolls dice until he gets doubles.  Your turn ends when you reach a bazaar booth or when the dice roller gets doubles.  Collect the right treasures in order to win.  An absolute blast to play, silly, silly, silly fun.

Start player is determined by "the person who flies the farthest when he jumps in the air."

As a kids game, it's a better game on paper than it is in practice. As a game for older children (10+) and adults, it's fine, but there are better dexterity games out there. It gets points for originality. Maybe it could be a good game after everyone has had one too many.

RATING: 8.5
Probably the most laughs per minute game I played this year. Wonderful family game. With the die rolling timing mechanism, the carpet flying is fast and furious, with some people cheering the die roller, while everyone else watching for the carpet to capsize. It is easy to become so fixated on flying well that you forget which shops you need to go to. There is some strategy in the tactical variant, which we played with, but it is hardly high strategy. That said, it is a lot of fun and will hit the table  often at my house.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.4
Fun dexterity racing game with nice components & board.  Easy rules, reasonably fast play.  You're being timed so you have to decide whether to blast your opponents or yourself along with puffs of air. The bellows are a little large for the box and so got permanently squashed--if you hold it the right way it is okay, but would be better if the box were taller.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
I think I prefer The Black Pirate as the dice rolling mechanic in Akaba means that sometimes your turn can be  over after as little as one puff.
Perhaps dispensing with the dice rolling and limiting each player to 5 puffs max. would work?
Still enjoyable with the right group.

Rating for kids game.
Akaba is a funny dexterity/memory game for kids (adult can also have fun with this game).  You use a gusset to move your flying carpet in different stands trying to find the objets you need.  During this time, another player rolls dice until he rolls double.  When he does roll double, the player turn his over.  It's pretty stressful for the player trying to move is carpet because he don't know how many time his turn will last!
The components of this game are very well done!

RATING: 7
A fun family game with good art and (fairly) easy setup. It's not often you run into a game that includes magic carpets! My kids enjoyed the game, even though they prefer more strategic games.

Playing a physics-based board game is an interesting switch. However, because it's physics-based, it definitely disadvantages younger kids. Also, amongst similar-aged players, it seems a bit random who wins and who doesn't.

Rating based on playing with children.  This is unusually time-consuming to set up for a children's game.  I would also make sure to play with children that are coordinated to be able to use the bellows effectively.  The table height and shape also seems to be important, as it can be difficult for them to effectively maneuver so that they can blow the carpet around.  The theme to the game is wonderful and I'm sure that with the right players it is really a lot of fun.  I look forward to playing this more (and updating my rating accordingly) in the future.

Undiluted fun.  We are closer to 5 years old than ninety-nine (the recommended age range of the game) but our twenties are long gong and so it appears are large parts of our memory skills.  However, Akaba got us off our seats and laughing throughout.

The use of bellows and the placement of the gifts onto your flying carpet to slow down any runaway leader are inspired touches and though the ways of ending your turn might cause tears and quarrels in a younger group as a gaming group in their thirties we were just about able to hold back our tears and contain any tantrum until we got back to our respective homes.

RATING: 10
Rating holding steady after playing with my 5 year old son twice - this is a fantastic game - memory and dexterity - lots to hold a kids interest.  In actuality, there is quite a bit of physics going on too - as you load up your flying carpet, the CG (that's center of gravity) moves upward, making the guy more likely to flip over as you get more presents.  I actually suspect this will go upward from 9 with more plays.  I am also noticing a  bit of blocking strategy that you can play as well as if the guy flips, your movement of the guy to a location away from what he or she needs.  This game could hold someone's interest easily through 8-10 years old and then resurface as one becomes an adult.

A very cute game that would probably be great with kids. 

It's a dexterity game where you are blowing (your) piece around the board trying to collect 5 items. There's skill, but also a lot of randomness: it's annoying when you take forever trying to roll doubles while your opponent rolls doubles on the first or second try! Still, the game is pretty interesting.

----
The board has cutouts where you place either wooden wall sections, creating a bunch of 3-sided market stalls, or market goods, which are tiles that lie flush with the board (use the orange market goods; keep the purple ones to the side). Give everyone a stack of 5 demand tiles, which each show one of 5 types of market goods: put 2 face up, and the rest in a face down draw pile. 

Each player's token is a guy on a flying carpet, which sits on a piece of foam. On your turn, you use a little bellows-thing to blow your token into a market. At the same time, another player is rolling 2 d6, trying to roll a matching pair of colors. The turn ends if they roll doubles, your token falls over or goes into the "fountain" (big hole in the center of the board), or if you get your token into a market. You're supposed to call "KOFF!" when any of this happens. If your token made it to a market (without falling over!), reveal a single goods token; if it's one that you need (demand tile), place it on your flying carpet and put a new token from supply (face down) back in the market. Then reveal the next demand tile in your stack. Play passes to the left. The first player to collect all 5 market items they need wins!

This has a unique combination of memory and dexterity, and it's a favorite game for my 4yo.

The age recommendation of 5 and up is probably appropriate, though (possibly even slightly low), as it was difficult for him to use the bellows at first. Luckily, the game is fun enough that he kept trying until he could do it well. Also, we have to play it on the floor to allow him to move around the board to effectively guide the carpet. His arms aren't yet long enough to reach around the large board, especially without upsetting all the components.

My copy was initially missing the bellows, but Haba has great customer service and I received a replacement quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
[HABA 2004 edition] {Fantasy, kid; dice-rolling, action, memory, timed-turn} {Adult 5, Kid 8} Akaba is a fun mix of memory and action game. Players use a bellow to blow carpet flyers to different shops on the market, in which they can purchase gifts for their friends. There is a lot of fun in playing Akaba, esp. when the carpet flyers fall or they fly long distance.

The bits are large and sturdy, which are suitable for children. The carpet flyers are made of foam, which may wear fast. It would be better if Haba can provide replacement.

There is not much direct player interaction. When a player is working with the bellow, another play keeps rolling dice to see when the active player has to stop.  Besides, players may need to compete for the presents. Nevertheless, it's still enjoyable to watch other blowing.

[The Black Pirate] For adults, "the black pirate" is a better game, in which player interaction and confrontation is stronger. IMO, Akaba is better for children, where memory is a secondary factor and confrontation is lower.  The themes (Arabian or Pirate) are similarly attractive for me.

Fun kid's game based on using a air bulb. This game is different from the other Haba air bulb game The Black Pirate/Der schwarze Pirat in that this game has a small memory element (the markets) and the air bulb is more frantic because of the time limit mechanism (another player rolls 2 dice until a double is hit). I find this game more fun/faster because of the time presure.

A neat dexterity and memory game that ultimately plays too long for what it is.  I understand the dice rolling is to keep someone from taking too long of a turn and to add some urgency into the carpet blowing itself, but it feels more and more like a chore.  I appreciate the unique gameplay and the creative elements designed for children, but clearly I'm not the target audience for this.

RATING: 8
I thoroughly enjoyed this game. It is essentially "roman bingo" but with extra complexity added to make it more fun. Based on the bingo-style draws, you place meeples on cards to buy areas & senators (objectives). Different cards are worth different amounts and combinations of cards can be very powerful. Perfect intro board game - it teaches some basic skills like worker placement and gets people used to the idea of euro games, but is extremely light and approachable.

RATING: 6
12+ plays, 3,4,5,6 players.

LIKE: A very light, laid-back game, great for waiting around for others. I liked the bingo / press-your-luck mechanism (we call it "Caesar Bingo"). Mild strategy.
DISLIKE: Being forgetful to grab bonus tiles. Not sure how it plays with two, but probably isn't as fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game delivers exactly what I was hoping: an easy playing game with rules you can explain in just a few minutes (minus the special objective abilities which can be detailed as they appear). There is a bit of thinking - just enough to entertain and not overwhelm - so it is more than 'gamer bingo'. I like it.

This is the third Mori game I've played (Libertalia, Batman: Gotham City Strategy Game), and it's another that has fallen flat for me.  This is a very light, very random game.  I've heard it called "Roman Bingo" and the name fits.  There are opportunities for some nice combination plays, but it seems like there are too many cards in the deck, making luck of the draw a significant factor and final scores vary widely.

Bingo with some other stuff tossed in for good measure.  There are some choices to be made, but they tend to be overshadowed.  By Bingo.

Still, a fun enough game if you approach it as "this is Bingo."  Don't expect much and you'll be fine.  A great, light family game if that's what you're looking for.  Probably a half decent intro game.

"Bingo for board gamers" is how this has been explained many times.  And... yup, that pretty much covers most of it.

This is a good game with a lot of luck, but it is a short game, so I am okay with that.

Very easy for new players to pick up, just explain what the card powers are as they come out. Because everyone is placing their guys all at the same time, it does not slow down much at all with more players and comfortably handles the 7 player max.

This is the game to play when you have party game numbers, but they are not drunk enough for a good party game yet.  :P

Played it a couple times with a casual gaming partner and it went well! I'd like to try this with a bigger group, also. Initial opinions: it's easy to explain, has an entertaining mix of luck (because half the fun is shouting what you want at the town crier) and strategic choices, and has a nice light weight. Also, I like the art.

Roman bingo, with your choice of bingo cards.  Deserves to be thrown to the lions.

This is a very nicely designed game of "euro bingo" that plays like a nice short gateway game.  In fact, this may be one of the top gateway euros for absolute gaming beginners, as well as very young children.  It is easy to imagine this game providing lots of fun for lots of first time euro gamers.  

As such, the game probably deserves an 8 of 10 for its contribution to gaming, and its elegant implementation of a few very basic mechanics (eg the bingo mechanic).  Yet, I am torn a bit in giving it an 8, because it is not a game that particularly grabs me and says "hey, play this one again!" and so I have to give it a 7.  Nevertheless, the accessibility of this game, and the obvious fun that it could provide to large segments of the public, means that this game has the potential to become a bestseller, and so, tip of the hat and respect for that.

Ancient Rome is my favorite era in history. But until now we haven't been able to find any Roman themed games that looked good for us. This one is a great game. Granted it is just Bingo! with a Roman theme pasted on (that's the only thing keeping this one from being a 10) but it is so much fun. Shouting "Ava Caesar!" instead of "Bingo!" just adds to it. This one is certainly staying with us.

Roman Bingo! Our group plays with a house rule that we deal out six starting cards to everyone then we draft one and pass to the left ala 7 Wonders. This helps mitigate someone running away with the game due to an amazing opening draw.

[ESP] Juego extremadamente sencillo. Me divertí jugándolo e intentando hacer mis objetivos y enfocándome en conseguir las recompensas. Sin embargo la suerte tiene una alta influencia, razón por la cual no tiene mejor nota. Además la existencia de cartas de "ataque" hace que un juego que debiese ser increíblemente ameno llegue a ser frustrante. Tendría que darle otra vuelta, aunque creo que a más de alguno le gustará como filler o juego introductorio...

A good light gateway game of bingo, set collection, and card combos. Definitely very luck-driven as you would expect. But it's pretty fun to chant for a specific symbol to come up and to laugh when probability sticks it to you and everyone else when nothing but rare symbols are drawn.

Simple gameplay is strangely paired with a somewhat complex scoring system. I've found it to be a little awkward, especially explaining it to non-gamers.

Unoffensive Roman-themed game of Euro bingo.  Player choice comes by the way of deciding where to place your "hits," picking new tiles, and executing various gained abilities.  I didn't have a particular problem with any of it, but it's hard to see me wanting to play it with either gamers or non-gamers.

The game basically murders Bingo for me, think of it as having a similar mechanic, but instead of drawing a random number it's a particular resource token which is marked on objectives you have laid out in front of you. You can score all manner of points, collect various reward cards, and I think the theme really shines through. Love the Legion meeples, the artwork, it's really great.

RATING: 8
Brilliant, brilliant take on Bingo, of all things. Use bingo actions to build up your retinue of cards that contribute to either penalizing others or gaining points for yourself. 

Quite easy to teach to anybody, really, and it's crazy, zany, a bit out of control but enough ways to mitigate randomness that it's a delight. 7 Wonders style delight.

RATING: 6.6
Initial rating, based on playing once. I'm left with a quite favorable impression of this game, but that's chiefly based on it playing pretty fast with six, and the elegance of drawing from the ever diminishing supply of tokens, until the joker gets drawn. Beyond that, though, the game is a total luck-fest, the push your luck mechanism is too limited, and the chance that cards you need to compete for the (too-important) bonus tiles just aren't available to choose from, is far too high. 

Probably better with fewer players, so you can more easily attempt several bonus goals?

Clever, fast, and simple - I like it a lot.  Obviously luck is a major factor, but there at least appears to be some decisions to be made.  Stupidly large box though…..

RATING: 5
One of the few family games that I actually want to play. It is a game that has a small rule set but manages to incorporates several mechanics together (Push-Your-Luck, Set Collecting, etc) in an interesting way. While I wouldn't call it a deep game, your decisions feel meaningful and there is quite a bit of information that you can process each turn. And it plays VERY quickly. 

Overall, very good game design. 

[Update] After playing this game over a dozen times, I feel like I've explored all that there is to explore. Still think its a clever design... but I don't particularly care to play it anymore.

Rise of Augustus.  Described as Roman Bingo.  Disks are drawn from the bag, which are matched with your tiles.  The jokers help to substitute for the rare disks and result in a rotation of the bag drawer.  Certain types and combination of disks lead to bonus tiles.  A nice filler usefully accommodating up to 6 players.

Fast and fun filler - actually the choice of cards to go for can be crucial and so whilst I bought this as a family game to play with 7 and 5 year old, they struggle to compete in reality (which frustrates them). Not sure I like the "push your luck" element of taking the VPs for number of cards held - seems a tad out of place - may well decide to ignore that aspect.  Looking forward to playing more.

Bingus Maximus!  Absolutely great game.  It has certainly quite a lot of luck, but you have the chance to drive this luck and many options to get the best of the tiles drawn.  Nice components, except for the box.  THE BOX IS JUST GIGANTIC.  THE SIZE IS JUST A BAD JOKE TO THE BUYERS.

Any game that makes the "bingo" mechanic work, deserves my respect. I would enjoy the game even more if it had a later end condition, and if all goals were easier (in order for someone to be able to perform more combos). It is also untolerable that most of the resources aren't used in the base game.

Well, Paolo Mori got some balls in taking bingo and giving it full game credentials.

The game is essentially nothing more than bingo, with a bit of special power related to each goal card and slightly more euroish scoring system... Luck is a bit mitigated, there are a couple of decision points every game, and it is short enough to be surprisingly enjoyable.

I traded for this to have a light game to play with my daughters (they love their Disney Princesses' bingo...), and it has been a huge success with them!

I believe this is going to hit our tables more often than not. First heard about this from Sam's Top 100 games and then watched both the videos by Tom and Richard.

Decided to snag a copy and try it. Finally got to try it and it is a blast. The simple mechanic of waiting for the right symbols to be called is fun.

Augustus is similar to Takenoko in that you need to get 7 of the objectives reached. The promo Emperor can be a important especially if you just need only 1 more symbol to score either the game or another objective so that you would be the first to claim the bonus points.

Very easy and family oriented. Hope there will be more to build this to become a more solid game!

This game seems to be polarizing with some loving it and others hating it.  I love it.  I quite enjoy the simple, but subtle strategy in the game.   My family quite like the game as well.  Augustus is a game that has a few meaningful choice throughout game play, that has rules that can be explained in 5 minutes without confusion, and that provides nongame’s a realistic chance of winning.  I enjoy the art and look of the game.  I find the bingo, draw tokens from a bag, mechanic fun.  That said, two of my gaming buddies really don’t like it, which is ok as I do not plan on playing it much with gamers.  It feels as though the game was designed for gamers to play with nongamers.  For me, this is a very important niche in my gaming collection.  Wonderful game.

Well, apparently I like gamer bingo. The mechanisms are so simple: just call out symbols as they are drawn from the bag and people mark them off on their cards. When you fill up one of your cards you get the points on that card, and also any special abilities that card holds. I love the simplicity of teaching the game, and also the variety of cards and abilities in the game. There is a potential downside, though, because the game can freeze if you have players with too much analysis-paralysis. I think that freezing will fade as you get more experience with the game, and a better understanding of how the different cards work. If you still have a problem, just make a point of not playing with AP folks. It's a minor complaint in a game that my family loves. This one is a definite keeper.

RATING: 5
An enjoyable bingoesque type game where you are drawing chits from a bag and placing your legions (workers) on cards that match the icons on the chits. When you complete a card you get bonuses. You complete seven cards and the game is over.

There is some set collection aspects and "first to objectives" for points. It is an enjoyable game with non gamers and family or as a quick fun filler with gamers.

There is some luck and randomness, but for the length of time and for it's amusement it doesn't overstay it's welcome.

Light, family game that I feared (at one point) was going to resemble Bingo. However, there is more strategy to this than meets the eye - the little tile you are given showing tile distribution hints at that - and although it is luck heavy there is enough to satisfy a seasoned gamer, at least for half an hour.

Ez a játék tényleg alkalmas arra, hogy bevezessünk olyan embereket a társasjáték világába. Azért vigyázni kell, hogy nehogy itt ragadjanak, mert ez a játék sajnos elég egyszerű és igazából vagy ezért vagy pedig a hangulat fokozásáért játszanék vele. Számtalan jobb játék létezik ebben a kategóriában, de az viszont ténye, hogy megállja a helyét ezen a porodon. Mindenképpen érdemes kipróbálni vásárlás előtt.

A solid family weight game that plays fast. Of course there is a high amount of luck involved with the random drawing of tokens from the bag, but it can be fun to hope for the right draws. It is quite light for my personal tastes, but I think this could be a fun game to play with new gamers or family members.

RATING: 7.5
A set collection game with a core mechanic that resembles Bingo.  The "bingo bag" consists of resource chits (some common, some rare) and two wild chits that reset the bingo bag.  The odds of drawing a particular resource changes the longer you go without drawing a wild chit, and you make tactical and (light) strategic choices based on what's left in the bingo bag.  The game end very quickly so you need to choose your objective cards carefully (i.e., limit the number of large, 5-6 cost objective cards) since many of them won't get finished.  Augustus is okay if you're in the mood for a VERY light game, but be prepared for a luck-heavy game that feels imbalanced (e.g., low values for cards with long term potential that often don't pay off because the game is so short)... perhaps the balance is better with experienced players and >2p since there would be more contention over VP objective tiles and less wishful thinking and big gambles of newbies.

2013. Others say: it's Roman Bingo or a faster 7 wonders, push your luck game... supposedly just bingo with Roman images instead of numbers.  

One BGGer says: it’s a little too light for me and I can’t help but feel that an opportunity may have been missed here as I like the drawing mechanic. I think it just needed some advanced rules or another element or two to offer some decision making and cleverness to the design. 

Another BGGer says: it's ripe for expansions with all of the unused symbols on territory cards, but others say it doesn't need expansions and the focus on gold and wheat is fine "as is" with no changes needed.

Nice light game. I wasn't sure I would like it, but I got it on a deal. It turns out, that everyone likes it. Easy and not-too-serious. The kids love being the town crier.

We always play with a draft at the beginning (laying out 6 cards/player and then choosing sequentially, then reverse, then original, letting the least experience choose first twice).

A light game in the vein of 7 Wonders. The "Bingo" mechanic is pretty fun. Makes for a very simple, easy to learn resource management game. 

It was also very quick, probably 20 mins a game. I would have appreciated a little more of a ramp, but I guess that's what makes this so light and quick.

Good, light game. Easy to teach, plays quick.

Bad art and color blindness issues but really fun gameplay.

This is often described as "bingo for gamers" but I would urge you not to describe it that way if you actually want people to play it with you. I've described it that way only to get blank faces on more than one occasion. Contrarily, almost everyone I've showed this game to really enjoys it. So if you come up with another way to make it sound fun or maybe just throw it on the table and say "we're playing this!", than it works great!

I'm on the fence about Augustus. On the one hand I really like the simplicity and I feel like I could teach it to pretty much anyone.

But on the other hand I think it might be just a little too simple for my tastes. If I were to play a game with non-gamers there are other games I'd rather pull out.

But then again it is so easy to teach...

After several games I have the impression that there really isn't much you can do to influence the outcome of the game, except for avoiding some obvious mistakes. The victory point difference between the players was huge in each game we played, and I never had the impression that one player made significantly better or worse decisions that the others.

There are some decisions that matter, but the variance of the draw is so high that even with the optimal decisions you only increase you chances by a tiny bit, so little that it isn't worth putting much thought into it.

Still, it's fun, with a little excitement each time a tile is drawn and the opportunity to scream Ave! like in Bingo.

I actually have a ton of fun playing this, partially because of how silly I feel while the tiles get drawn. As a group, we always fight like children over who gets to draw the tiles. I also can't help but cry out "Bingo!" when I complete a card. The only real skill is in knowing which cards to choose and which ones to accomplish first. Otherwise the game pretty much plays itself. A very light, fun, gateway game nevertheless.

UPDATE: Still like this game, but we've played it to death. This is desperately needing an expansion.

What's the Latin for Bingo? This is certainly Bingo in very entertaining board game form - with enough complexity built into the scoring to make it into much more than just simple randomness - though your fate often, inevitably, lies in the lap of the gods. Not surprised to see it do well in the SdJ; indeed surprised it didn't win. The slightly clunky scoring/timing rule may be the reason.

I was told that this was just like Bingo but with a roman theme… I don’t know why I even agreed to play after this introduction! Well, I guess it’s because I love to play new games (as you can see in my previous threads from 2013), but damn I was sceptic! However, it turned out to be a decent game – and I actually think it is going to win Spiel des Jahres! It seems like it has the right level of complexity for this award. 

Yes, you do randomly draw chits from a bag, so there isn’t a TON of strategy involved... But there is much more than in real bingo. When you get a match, you can only choose to place it on ONE of the “numbers” (roman items in this game), so you need to choose wisely (or rearrange them). You need to do this, because what you’re trying to do is to filling out boards (just like in bingo). You get VPs for this, so you don’t just win once you have completed a board; a player triggers the game-end once he has completed 7 boards, but that doesn’t mean he is going to win! 

First, you count your VPs for your board, and then you count your VPs for your bonus objectives. Which objectives, you ask? The objectives which make the game acceptable, I answer. These general objectives are what make the game decent enough to play; the first player to complete 3 pink/green/brown/senators or one of each get some VPs, and then the others cannot gain these even though they also complete 3 tasks. So there is a race to be the first one! Also, there are objectives you get when you complete tasks; there is one for 2, 3, 4 and 5 completed objectives if I remember correctly, and you can only choose one of these the moment you complete the number of tasks – if you choose the one for 2 completed objectives, you cannot gain a higher one, so you don’t get as many VPs. Again it’s a race to get the higher bonus objectives, and I guess this is why I did find the game okay and not absolutely terrible which I had feared! It was perhaps slightly too long considering the amount of brainburning it involved (i.e. none), but I wouldn’t reject to play it again a few times over the next decade.

Yep... it's "Gamer Bingo." Probably the most accurate two-word description I can think of for any game!

And, it's surprisingly fun. What brings the "gamer" element to the table is a bit of probability management and a race to complete certain objectives and nab some key points. There's also a bit of synergy between cards that have special powers when they are completed.

It's light, it's approachable, and it is easy to play twice during a work lunch hour.

Augustus is basically Bingo with an arbitrary theme slapped on. Except for some very limited statistical decisions it doesn't feel like there is anything you can do to influence the outcome of the game. But since I don't own any incarnation of Bingo, this game is actually quite fun for me. It's a great game for situations where you would like to play a short and easy to explain game but don't feel the need to think about any strategy at all. If you don't mind the completely arbitrary Roman theme, you will get a very nicely illustrated version of Bingo with quality components. But don't let the ridiculously oversized box fool you: All you get is a card game with some cardboard tokens an a handful of tiny meeples. You could probably store this game in its box about 20 times. (This is for the Hurrican (2013) edition using the German rules included with the game.)

Many call this game a modern version of Bingo, often with a sneer so that they can then subsequently dismiss the title. Real Gamers Don't Play Bingo, that sort of thing. I think they are all too full of themselves to take a bit closer look at Augustus. Yes, the way resources enter the game isn't spectacular, but if you play without paying attention to what others are working on they will secure more bonus points than you and win. Which is what a game is about, of course... not to mention that said watching is completely absent from Bingo. Also there are a few small timing pinpricks to watch out for: if you finish a card before someone else you get to draw a new one first; you may be exempt from a nasty effect, or be better prepared against it. Frankly, the game reminded me in some way of 7 Wonders, but in reverse; and if I had a choice between the two I'd pick Augustus. Certainly not a bad little game.

I'm not sure if I rated this too high or too low. For what it is, it's a simple game of bingo. Do you have the correct symbol, place a marker on the symbol. Oh and if you have "Bingo" you instead cry out, "Avae Caesar!" Cute, but it doesn't make for a deep game. The strategy that you do enact if going for cards that'll give you particular bonus that could help you complete multiple cards or make it easier to complete cards. With all that said, this was a rather enjoyable game. Would I bring it out with my heavier Euro friends? No. But this is something anyone from expert to beginner to everywhere in between could play, and could enjoy at least once or twice. I do worry about it's longevity though.

Heard this being described as "bingo for gamers", which is probably true.
A very light and accessible game. you probably don't need to be sober to play this.

I think this is probably a realyl good little game for when you want something that is just a little bit longer in game length than i.e. games like "sushi go" or "love letter" but on a similar level of complexity.

Maybe just a prettier "Qwixx"...

Gamer bingo is a bit of a simplification but not by much. Players have some agency in choosing certain cards to complete and how to place workers to cover the spots that come up in the bag draw. Strategy is light but still there. A decent filler for gamers. Neat art and good component quality though the theme is pasted on.

Really surprised at how much I enjoy this game.  A friend of mine gave me this game after having bought it in a set of 3 games from someone else that no longer wanted it.  So my hopes weren't high, and hearing that it was basically "Roman Bingo" didn't sound like something I would like.  I was quite wrong!  The "Bingo" part of the game actually adds some excitement and anticipation into the game, and the amount of strategic options players are allowed is actually quite surprising.  This game isn't heavy by any means, but as a good, light game, I love it.

This game is a combination of set collection and bingo. The active player keeps drawing tiles from a bag and calls out the type. All players then have a chance to either place a worker on a goal card to fulfill that requirement or move a worker from another card. Once a goal card is complete, you pause the game, perform any special action and then add it to your completed pile of VP. There are also some goal tiles that can be claimed for VP as well.

A fairly easy game to explain to people and quick moving since all players act at the same time. Even though the end game is based on completing so many turns, the last round can have wild swings in the leader. There wasn't enough to draw me into the game to make me want to play it again in. Having more player interaction or ways to mitigate the draws would have been nice. Component quality was average.

Have played this a few times with group, and seems to  go down well. (Did get the rule about stealing the gold/wheat reward wrong initially.) Al more likely to propose it than me.

Wondering if the objective card which lets you complete another objective for free is a bit overpowered ? Esp. if you can contrive to have a valuable card in hand at the same time.

"Roman Bingo" is attractively themed, but takes just *slightly* too long to teach for how luck-based it really is.  Bad choice of font too - the most 'themey' thing you really get to do is read off the names of the cards, and this is made unnecessarily difficult.  I don't mind the red-herring resources that so many provinces irrelevantly produce, but it'd be nice if they could be visually backgrounded versus the actually important wheat and gold.  Otherwise, it's fine for what it is.

Players are Roman nobles, trying to impress Emperor Augustus, by controlling Senators and Roman provinces.  Surprisingly fun "Bingo" style game, where a player pulls chips from a bag, announces the type, and each player proceeds to place a legionary on one of their cards they are attempting to fill up.  When a card is complete, they announce it and apply any power that was on the completed card.  Cards are either Senators or Provinces, and award victory points.  Bonus tiles may be awarded for completing combinations of cards which award more victory points.  The game ends when a player completes their seventh card - most points wins.

Very playable, fun game.  For such a simple game, there are some nice timing issues to puzzle over, and some cute combinations can occur as cards are completed and powers applied.  A keeper for now.

Place meeples on cards to complete them. Choose right cards that you want and can complete to score bonus points.

Cards have different sets of symbols that you need to claim before completion. Some are more common than others.

RATING: 5
One player not paying attention can really mess with this game. Oh, they didn't realise someone was that going to get an extra completion, so the game should turn back so they can grab a points chip. Oh, they didn't realise they had qualified for one of the bonus tiles so they should have gotten it several turns ago, never mind people have tried pushing towards the bonus.
Ugh.
The game, otherwise, is somewhat fun, but seems very random. The bag you draw from passes around, but the passing is meaningless, as there's no benefit or power from the bag. You'd think the caller could negate one tile, or put it back and draw again, to diminish the randomness. Or some ability card that passes around the table allowing a double placement, something so the game isn't so luck dependent.

Has been called “gamer bingo”, and that’s fair, but it rises above that expectation.   There is enough choice to keep it interesting, and there is a level of excitement/frustration with each pull from the bag.    The scoring tiles aren’t particularly inspired, but they work well enough in creating competition.    It’s light enough to make a good family game, and it plays quickly.     Of the three SdJ nominees for 2013, this is my favorite by quite a bit.

Fun implementation of a Bingo mechanic with a few decisions to make to keep things interesting. You have a better chance of winning if you watch what objectives, bonuses, and rewards others are going for. My 7- and 9-year-olds picked up on the rules quickly. A great family game, I'd say. Takes around 30 minutes, another point in its favor.

The luck of the bingo drawing can be frustrating, for sure, but what really killed the game for me is the downtime when someone was chaining actions or making a choice.

[3 plays] I really liked this game a lot. The Roman theme meant I was looking on it with favor before we opened the box. I didn't time our games, but I think this is about the half-hour game it was billed as.  The game-end trigger is someone getting a certain amount of stuff completed.  The game is long enough to give everybody a chance for some clever maneuvers, but not long enough to ever drag.

Production is great, and I loved the legionary meeples. We do have a running joke now about the "frozen peas" card; the province cards show the goods they produce, and one good was a basket of green peas that we didn't realize were actually grapes till we saw them next to a wine bottle.  There's one province with the basket of peas next to a huge block of ice, hence frozen peas (actually, of course, grapes and marble). My folly aside, though, the cards are very nice-looking and the iconography is all very clear. 

This game was really the porridge that's just right. There are enough interlocking combinations and different bonus things to try to do that it's constantly interesting, but not so much going on that it's overly complicated. 

I've only played with 2p, and it does play up to 6, which is a virtue. From what I've seen, I think this game would stand up well to play at higher player counts. Everyone is constantly engaged, because every tile draw matters to you. And when there's a pause for someone to resolve a card they have completed, you still care: (1) they may be claiming bonus tiles that you were working toward; (2) their card may have a smiting effect; (3) their card resolution will change the available tableau, which you'll care about. So almost everybody is interested almost all the time in almost everything that happens, which is what you want in a 6p game. 

I like the tile draw mechanism. You've got a bag with a known distribution of different tiles, and you draw from it until the one wild-card tile is drawn, at which time everything goes back in the bag. The wild tile means everyone can take it as whichever thing they want. So if you're waiting for one particular kind of tile to emerge, and it doesn't, and the odds of it doing so are growing with each tile drawn--at the end of the run, if it still hasn't shown up, you get a free thing (the wild tile) that you can make into the thing you wanted. 

The province cards have their Roman names AND a map graphic highlighting where they are, which is cool. This game has the level of theme where if you are into it, it adds to your enjoyment; if you are paying any attention, you might learn a little something; and if you don't care at all about the theme, you can just play it as a mechanically fun game. 

Rise of Augustus made a really positive first impression on me (my 3 plays are from one session where we liked the game so much we kept playing again), and I look forward to playing it more and trying how it is with more people.

This is one of the best gateway games. It teaches worker placement, variable powers, and set collection. It beckons to non-gamers with the familiarity of bingo, but actually allows you to make relatively meaningful decisions about where to place your markers based on the current trade row, available trophies, and previously drawn tokens. It has luck, but also the opportunity to make bad decisions, which all good games should.

A super fun set collecting race game with some press your luck elements where you are trying to complete the objectives on cards by placing your pawns on the icons called as they are drawn from a bag. The cards you complete give you benefits and also count for scoring at the end of the game. The game ends when one person completes 7 objective cards. Plays super quick, and the gameplay is interesting as you decide what objectives and combinations to go after and time your combinations to give the most benefits. People liken it to Bingo but I don't really see it. In Bingo when you get B9 you mark off all your cards that have B9. In Augustus you can only place one pawn at a time on one symbol. Also you are allowed to move your pawn from one symbol/card to another. It actually feels more like Karuba to me than it does Bingo – one common item is drawn from a pool and everybody uses it for their own individual purposes. Lots of variety in the cards that would be available each game (88 provided and you only use a few) with some luck of the draw[bag] but there are solid and sometimes tricky decisions to be made i.e. whether to go for a card with max points or a card with less points but an amazing benefit, and there are certain cards that if you are able to get them will help to even out draw dependency. Lovely components but housed in a box that is WAY too big for what you get in it. 

I’m liking it so far because it is different to anything we currently own and super easy to learn and play. Also, some of the Roman card names are totally hilarious…well the ones that don’t sound like a weird STD :D The game pauses when somebody completes an objective and has to choose a new card, but if you are paying attention and are aiming for harmonious (combo) goals and/or specific bonus tokens then even that goes quite quickly as you should know what card you want next. This bit is much better at low player counts because there is not such a high turnover of the card pool. The icons are handy for the language independence of the game, but some of them are a bit unintuitive so we still need to refer to the charts from time to time. Not sure how people are playing this particular rule...but when the joker comes out the current town crier decides what the icon will be, then refills the bag and passes it on to the next player.

It's a quick, fun, exciting and highly replayable filler to break out when you need to inject some adrenaline in the players around the table. It's light enough to chat over, but not so light that it's brain dead. One of the best 5 euro games I've ever bought!

Plays fast and has basically no downtime. It's not bad as a gateway game, because it familiarizes players with basic scoring concepts that they will eventually encounter in other games while keeping the options of what to do in a single turn to a minimum. But it's a game you may want to leave behind at some point because it's too light.

Also it feels like there's an expansion missing because a lot of the icons don't mean anything yet.

Bingo for gamers, or Bingo meets 7 Wonders.

Love it!  Very good family game and for non-gamers, addictive, and I think it had more Spiel des Jahres qualities than the eventual winner Hanabi.  Can play a 3-4 player game in 15-20 minutes with experienced players.

Some negatives: - iconography isn't always the most intuitive; - artwork for future expansion is distracting and makes it harder to notice gold/wheat; - some downtime can happen when a player has to select a new objective card.

"Gamer's Bingo" (but not in a derogatory way like others might use it).  Fun and satisfying for as quickly as you can bang out a game after playing just once.  Sure there's a fair amount of randomness, but you can mitigate it and there's a fair amount of strategy.  Plus, 30 minutes is more of an absolute upper limit to the game.

Yes, it is Roman Bingo, but there is actually more to it than Bingo, so do not be put off. A lot depends on your choice of cards to fill, and that focuses you onto certain of the bonus tills. A lot depends on how quickly you can complete some tiles, or on what the other players intend to do. So there's some thought required when picking your next card.

It's significant that when I play with new players, they only complete 1 or 2 cards by the game end, but when I play with experienced players, several complete 4 or 5 at least. There's real competition in the game, despite the moderate luck involved in the basic mechanism.

No language in the game itself and very familiar icons make it very easy to play a foreign language copy.

Very very quick to play, it takes longer to explain than to play, and you'll play a few games in a row typically.

Great game! Very playable and with lots of emotions. It does not really matter that it is a pure luck fest. The gameplay itself and racing other players for bonuses is so engaging that I do not care. Minor problems are some unbalanced elements - orange and military cards are worthless, some bonuses should be scored in other way.

Fúú, nagyon rossz ez a játék. Lehet, hogy azért mert a qwixxtől semmit se vártam, ettől meg azért valamit mégis, de engem nagyon szíven ütött, és sokkal rosszabbnak érzem még mint a qwixet. Az legalább nem akar többnek látszódni, mint ami.
Ami döntés van azt kb.e egy ötéves átlátja két perc alatt, utána meg már csak húzkodjuk a cuccokat, és akinek jobban összejön az nyer. A libertalia után nagy csalódás Moritól.
Ráadásul fájdalmasan kevés az interakció, pedig legalább ennyit elvárnék egy ennyire "könnyed" játéktól.

Bingo with pretty graphics. Completely luck driven, with almost zero strategy. It is beyond my understanding what makes this game appealing to anyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
"Gamer Bingo" is quite a fitting description. It is very much like Bingo but still provides space for a few decisions and some player influence. Luck still plays an important role, of course, and the game needs to be played quickly in order not to overstay its welcome. Six players is probably also a little much since it is a good idea to keep an eye on what other players are doing, and downtimes upon completion of multiple objectives can easily become a drag.

Light filler-type family game with a pretty bad rulebook.

This game is to Bingo what Love Letters is to Go Fish. The strategy is a little lighter than what I usually like, but it goes quickly and is easy to set up/put away. There's definitely a luck aspect, but like many games it's all about mitigating how much you rely on luck.

RATING: 6
Bought it because I was charmed and intrigued by the idea of Bingo used as motor for a proper game.
It does not really succeed however. 
My major concern is that the objects that you should fulfill are just too unballanced. 
If you are lucky enough(and luck is maybe 70 percent of the game) to get hold of the right ones, you will win. 
Towards the end choosing objects is also no fun because you will probably not be able to complete them anyway. And having to give thought to meaningless choices, I find, is a real no no in a game.
The main idea is good though. But it suffers from severe lack of testing, I think.
Pity they published it too soon:(

Nice bingo style game to play with non-gamers or when you have limited time for playing.

Pros:
+ It's fast game - no redundant time spent,
+ Very easy rules and simple gameplay - suitable for non-gamers also,
+ Nice components and design,
+ Original theme.

Cons:
- Too much random chance,
- Not enough balance - some objective cards have strong powers, some do not have powers or even enough victory points,
- Not enough variety in gameplay and quite low replay value,
- The box is too large. Although the box is as large as, for example, Dominion's box, it doesn't serve as organized components storage.

Personal: is a bingo with Roman provinces. Take one tile and see if you can place a legion on your provinces, if you control one you have some bonuses and will take another one. With simply rules and Bingo style you have a fun game. Lets say that, although this is a bingo style, the luck factor can be controlled quite well

What a great surprise! Augustus takes the core mechanic from Bingo and builds a great game around it. You pick goals from a market, which have different costs and give different benefits when you complete them. The town crier player draws disks from a blind bag, with resource symbols you can conquer in your objectives. The choice of when to take the "achievement" tiles is also very interesting. Do you take it now, or leave it behind and try for the next one? Games are fast and fun.

A variation of Bingo where a player draws tiles from a bag and everyone decides for themselves how to best place those tile on their own cards. As cards fill up, there are different rewards and new cards can be drawn.

This is basically bingo with a few decisions, mostly about playing the odds and choosing your next objective card. It seems to end too soon, but at least it doesn't overstay its welcome by an hour like "Thebes" (another game with a huge luck factor in pulling tokens out of a bag). It may serve as a filler or a very light family game, but I really dislike the way the rewards for completing a number of cards work: taking a low reward early or trying to get a higher one at the risk of not getting any. With the ludicrously big box - standard square size, when all the components would fit comfortably in a "Carcassonne" expansion box - the game is not worth the shelf space.

Már eleve szimpatikus volt a játék témája (valamint, amikor kipróbáltuk Nóri nagyon megszerette), de az árképzése miatt megvártuk, amíg használtan hozzá tudunk jutni egyhez. Minden a játék ellen felhozott „vád” igaz: ár/érték arány, nagy szerencsefaktor, kiszámítatlanság, túlméretezett doboz, …
Azonban ennek ellenére nekünk nagyon is tetszik ez az ókori „bingó”. Egyszerű szabályai könnyen taníthatóak, 6 személy is tud vele játszani (és ekkor is elég gyors a játék). Jó kis izgalom, amikor várjuk, hogy a kikiáltó mit húz ki, majd „Ave Ceasar” felkiáltással végre mi is birtokba vegyük kiszemelt lapunkat.
A lapok közül a plusz légiókat adó lap(ok) nagyon erősek, általában az azt megszerző játékos lesz a győztes.
Érdemes olyan lapokat választani, hogy mindig tudj légiót letenni vagy mozgatni egyik-lapról a másikra. A játékban a legrosszabb érzés, amikor csak vársz és vársz egyetlen egy korongra, hogy kihúzásra kerüljön és nem haladsz a hódítással.

Augustus is a very accessible and quick gateway game. I've introduced it to several groups of people all with positive results. The symbology of the game can be a bit overwhelming at first, but none of the cards are hidden so you can explain how they work openly and publicly as many times as needed.

I think the game does suffer a bit from the "correct" strategy being to simply complete as many cards as possible as fast as possible (taking the smallest available points), but this certainly can backfire at times. 

Ultimately, this game does a good job of being a very fast and accessible game with just enough strategy to keep it interesting. It's a little on the light side, even for me, but if you think of it as a filler instead of a real gateway game, you won't be disappointed.

A fairly random little filler. There are certainly some differences from Bingo--there are different odds, and players are pursuing goals that come from completing cards.  It also includes some take-that cards which could be quite nasty and felt a little out of place in this style of game.  (1 play)

When Rich sat us down to play this, he described it lightly as 'bingo for gamers' - and he means it in the best way possible! A little luck, a little strategy, and beautiful art make this a fun, light game that engages everyone to try and reign supreme. I liked the little bonus scoring tiles to throw in a little something extra to aim for while you're playing. I wish that the gameplay was just a little longer though, so see the full effect of the benefits of finished cards.

Not bad in that it is a great game to teach new player because of it's simple mechanics, but it takes much to long to get through a game for what it is and there is a lot of AP produced in new gamers because of how often you are selecting from the face up cards - however new gamers are primarily who I'd want to play this with.

This one is just addictive, can't help play like three of four games in a row.

The game flows smoothly, the wide variety of cards and combos ensure great replayability, combined of course with the random factor of picking the tokens out of the bag.

You may think it's a bit costly for what's inside the box (clearly oversized), but imho it's worth every penny.

Yea, rough descriptions of "gamer's bingo" are mostly accurate.  Still, that doesn't make it a bad thing.  Keeps everyone engaged, and there are some interesting decisions since you only have so many markers so you have to shift plans at times.  Also an interesting decision when you choose a replacement board.

Still, I wouldn't go out and suggest everyone own a copy...

RATING: 7
I love this game since day one. The cards are nicely designed, and it is a lot of fun to play. The "luck" inside element bothered me at first but in the end, I think it is a light game to use as such. Of course you can find some great combos but I also noticed that having a good start with nice cards from the beginning was important to win. I have lost the last four games I played with my 4 years old daughter. Yesterday she managed to get 91 points while I was struggling to get over 50 points... But it feels good to win sometimes with a great combination of cards you thought about. You can't do that everytime, though, hence an 8 instead of a 9. At the end of the day, that's a great family game!

Bingo game of limited depth, perhaps would be better if it was quicker or had an extra mechanic to spice things up.  Not a great deal of player choice involved.

Just because people were calling out "bingo" instead of "ave caesar" partway through this game when they completed a card does not mean this game took its inspiration from that tried and true activity ... does it? Well ... at the very least this game is a big step up, and that feat in and of itself is probably worthy of some kind of award. Spiel des Jahres nominated, and it will probably win. Highly recommended as a fast and enjoyable game that keeps six people busy and entertained for up to an hour. Recommended.

I was avoiding the game hearing it's Bingo+.  Finally after trying I must say it is... Bingo+, but it has interesting decisions and is a blast to play.  High fun factor and short playing time make it a great filler.

Bingo!  "Take it Easy!" with cards, and meeples.  Unlike TiE, you the cards you scored bingo on give you points and usually some side benefit (either immediate or in helping you complete more bingos).  A fair amount of luck, could be a little shorter, but harmless enough for a longer "filler" with 6 people

Great game, easy to teach and get to the table. As advertised, since everyone is playing simultaneously, you really can play a whole game in 30 minutes, even with 6 players!

After 4 plays (with 15 unique players), I am going to remove cards 81 and 82 (opponents discard 1 of their completed objectives) from the deck. If you know to look for them, you can play around them, but I've seen too many new players get ambushed. If I run across a group that has played before, I'll re-introduce the cards.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (March 2014)

Ok family game to play from time to time. The rules are very easy to grasp and the game flows quickly. The art is great :thumbsup: and it plays very quickly. Reminiscent of Bingo, but much better, at least in Rise of Augustus you know the probability of the possible elements that can come out, this along with the different cards and bonuses, makes the game very fun with some interesting decisions. 

On the bad side, there are a lot of “take that” cards that doesn’t thrill me. I have come to dislike this mechanic and it is mostly luck if you can get one of them or not. Perhaps with 3 players there are a lot more of skill involved. With more luck becomes too prominent, but as the game is so light/quick, I don’t mind much. 

I’m not sure if I will buy the game, there is a possibility but I still feel it is way too light for me. Perhaps I would buy it to play with my  family.

I just bought it as it has been a strong gateway game, besides my GF really like it. 

It seems more of the time the player who achieves 7 goals wins the game, so the obvious strategy seems to be get the shortest, easiest to achieve goals.

Still I enjoy the game.

Before playing this I would not have believed you could craft a simple but fun and absorbing game with an acceptable amount of strategy out of the core bingo mechanism, but now I know you can.

Decisions essentially revolve around choosing which bonuses to go for and selecting objective cards to suit, plus to a lesser but at times significant extent deciding which objective cards to play your meeples on). It's not Through the Ages, but there's enough here to both engage and entertain the brain.

If anything the greater the number of players the better the game becomes due to increased competition for the various bonuses - more to think about.

This is a really great light, family game. When i first heard the description, "it's like bingo, but fun," I could not imagine how that could possibly be true, but it really is. The objective effects and bonus tiles add just enough interesting decisions to turn bingo into something I actually think is really fun. It's perfect for families and for those evenings when you feel too burned out for a heavy thinker.

While admittedly on the light side, "gamer bingo" is an unfair moniker for this one. It has just enough depth and interesting decision to rank as an enjoyable game for a lighter crowd. I'll be curious to see how I feel about it after repeat plays, but an overall positive first impression.

Okay sure, Roman Bingo.  But man, it is super fun!  We've only so far tried this out with two players but, I can see the potential for this with larger groups.  I think what I like the most is how easy it is to get into.  Add to that the slight strategy of deciding where to put your legionnaires and the special powers some of the cards have, you've got a winner!  A really great one.  :)

In this game item tiles are randomly drawn and meeples are placed on those items on your tiles. Yes it is a little like BINGO, but there is slightly more strategy. You can select the tiles to go for and completing them can give special actions or abilities. You also start with only seven meeples, but these can be moved to a called item from an item on a tile. There are also wild tiles in which you can select an item and you can consider how many of that item tile are in the game. Some of the actions are screw your neighbor which can be annoying. I think it can seem like your decisions are more meaningful than they probably are. There is obviously a big luck component.

Each player has three cards in front of him. Each card shows some symbols. One player draws a chit with a symbol out of the sack. All players can put a worker on a corresponding symbol. When a player has completed all symbols on a card, he shouts out Bingo... ahm, Ave Caesar! The cards give points and most of them also special abilities. To add interest there are a few achievements awarded to the first player to fulfil them.
An enjoyable light family game that manages to take the suspense of the bingo lottery and make a real game out of it. It suffers a bit from repeated breaks in the game flow when players complete a set and think longer what replacement card to take. This doesn't fit with the otherwise crisp gameplay. Due to the simultaneous gameplay it's playable with 6 players but take care that all players are concentrated or it will outstay its welcome. My play was marred a bit by one player constantly talking with another player and making all of us wait for his placement.

Basically this is bingo for board gamers. It's a pretty light game but is always a hit when I bring it out to the table, who doesn't love pulling tokens from a bag? Basically each turn you draw a token and everyone can place a piece on a corresponding symbol on their cards, when you cover all the symbols on your card you get to apply the special effect and take a new card. The simultaneous play make this a very quick game and while it's pretty light in terms of decision-making it's a nice filler+ sort of game.

Hmmm, az kétségtelen, hogy érdekes, megkockáztatom, hogy egyedi ötlet a bingó mechanikáját társasjátékban alkalmazni. A többi elem viszont nem különösebben izgalmas. A szerencse szerepe nem kicsi, túl nagy stratégiákra ne számítsunk. Bevallom, valahogy kimondottan taszít ez a játék. Pedig nagy gond végül is nincs vele, valószínűleg csak az ízlésemmel nem kompatibilis.

2 Games deep in one weekend, that's how fast and simple this game is.  So far its a blast... it doesn't seem deep at all so we will see if it will hold up over repeated plays.  Likely it will be the new go to for family games with newbies.

RATING: 7
Hmm, much less strategic than I thought it would be.

The randomness of the cards multiplied by the randomness of other players taking the cards you might want multiplied by the randomness of the called item equals a boat-load of randomness.

Will play more just to look at the art, but probably not a keeper.

Also, the cost is too much for this game. I've never seen a box with more empty space than this one.

I bought this game because of its lightness, since I wanted a game I could play with my relatives over the christmas holidays. When my uncle came over for my brothers birthday, we opened the box and played this for the first time. It was a very enjoyable game and in the end we played it three times that day. I can see this being played a lot more in the future, because it is so easy to understand that it can be played with pretty much anyone. Also I like that it is quite a short game that can be finished in less than an hour, which is usually the maximum amount of time a non-gamer is willing to invest into a boardgame.

RATING: 7
This truly is gamer bingo, and I found the game quite entertaining.  Considering the game only takes 15-20 minutes, this makes an excellent filler or closer so to speak.  I do think that players need to keep province tiles that can be completed quickly to protect against the bum rush that can end the game very quickly.  That is my primary concern about the game is that I'm not certain there is much protection against bum rushes in low player counts particularly.  

My other beef with this game is that it comes in way too large a box AND it feels a bit incomplete - one can tell that there is plenty of room for expansion which appears to be planned based on tile distribution and box size.

RATING: 5
Definitely deeper than the "Roman Bingo" tag it gets. I'm terrible at it and with 6 players it just goes on too long and there's less scope for tactical play.

It’s described as “bingo for gamers” and I guess, yeah, it’s that. (The “bingo” part is accurate, but “gamers” usually want more than what this offers.) It’s goofy fun and suitable for rain-dancing or finishing out a night, but I can’t see anyone making an appointment to play this game.

Bingo done right, where you have to balance choosing abilities that make it more likely you'll always have some icon that can be fulfilled, so that you can feasibly complete a card before you run out of icons, points, and strong abilities. However there is quite a bit of luck dependence, and depending on the cards someone can chain to basically cause runaway leader.

A fine little game that gets compared to Bingo a lot. There are definite similarities in that you cover a space when a certain tile is drawn randomly. However you can move markers around in various ways to help yourself complete provinces. I like how you can put together sets to get some points built up. Ultimately while the game doesn't drag that much I have trouble maintaining interest in it.

Mixture of luck and judgement in a quick format that falls in a similar bracket to 7 Wonders and RfTG, but in my opinion certainly does a better job of entertaining than the former... described to me as "Roman Bingo" before playing due to the tile draw/announce symbol/place on appropriate free symbol mechanic, but I think the only comparison is a positive one as it means the mechanic is immediately easy to grasp. Have played this 4 times in quick succession and enjoyed it each time. We achieved appreciably better scores as a group each game, demonstrating the need for skill/strategy.

Bingo ! Need I say more? Bingo revisited ? 

This game is a kind of bingo game. Tokens are called and you can cross them away on your card. If your card is full, you win the card and get points and optionally some supplementary advantage.
When you have completed 7 of these "cards", the game ends.

What a surprise this game was. I had expected something else from a nominee for Spiel des Jahres.

But its not all bad. When you are looking for a simple family game with lots of luck, and a little euro sauce, this is a game you should check out.

Luckily, the game doesn't last too long.

We still really enjoy this game. Gamer bingo is about the best description and it is the perfect game to play with the kids. You might hate it yourself, but bingo is a popular common demoninator game and this is a very good advanced variant. We still don't feel the need for an expansion which is surprising as this was the first thing we thought the game had been made for with all the extra symbols on the background of the task cards.

I don't know if it applies to all copies, but with ours, if you install the "Layar" app on your smartphone and hold the phones camera up to the games box front cover the guy on the front comes alive (along with all the background) and explains the game to you. Just a fantastic effect and one that makes everyone I have showed it to want to play the game!

First Impression 8

It's a bingo!... but a great bingo!

It's hard to explain, It's hard to believe, but that's the way it is. Currently in my top 5 list to buy.

A family game, a quick game, and probably and excelent gateway game.

-----------------------------------------------------------

After 12 games: 8

I finally managed to get the game at a good price and took it to a family non-gamers weekend. It was an instantaneous hit with 10+ games in a day and a half.

After having played 12 games I though about lowering the score, because it is a very simple game that do not offer a "meaty" experience, but on a second though I realised that it achives the requirements for an 8: I will never turn down a game, I like to play, and definitely I would recommend it.

Overall an excelent gateway game, and an excellent filler (max 30 min with an average of 20 I would say), but don't expect a deep, clever or complex game... just enjoy the fun!

This is as easy to teach as Ticket to Ride, which makes it a good gateway.

There is strategy in the game in how you place your meeples and what cards you choose. There's also a lot of luck, though, in how the chips come out. It can be frustrating when the chip draw doesn't go your way. I think what makes that tolerable is that the game is quick.

But why did they make the box so big!? It could have been half the size.

This is one of the few games I have that is good with 6 players.  Everyone involved on every turn.  Fun bingo mechanism.  Light enough to bring out with non-gamers, but keeps everyone engaged, gamers and non-gamers alike.  The worker placement is interesting and elevates this from being just bingo, but the real secret sauce in this game is that bonus tiles.  It can be incredibly fun racing rivals for certain tiles.

Traded.

Loved the art, but this game fell into an uncomfortable niche where it was far too light to play with gamers at meetups, and yet there were too many icons to explain for it to act as a filler or to play with non-gamers. Didn't foresee it getting played.

RATING: 7
As a lot of other people have pointed out, this game had a lot of potential to be a much better game, but fell very short. In the end, it's a fairly decent game for playing with non-gamers, or if you just want an easy-going game to play with the family. It doesn't drag on too long, and is pretty easy to play in the background while people are talking. The box is much to big and gaudy though. It could easily have been half the size, and still had plenty of room. I wouldn't say this game revolutionizes Bingo in the same way that Red7 revolutionized Uno, but it is a step up, and one I would recommend if you can find for a good deal.

Great attempt to make bingo work as a real game. There are actual decisions in this one. It's very easy to teach and quick to play. Don't be fooled by huge box (shame on publisher, awful rulebook too) or Roman 'theme' though, the bingo comparisons are honestly true . But if you want some bingo in your life, this is a nice package. 

2-Player Comment:
* Works just as well with all player counts. It's fun 2p game.

Initial Rating: 7. Reminiscent of bingo but deeper, since there are several kinds of rewards and available combos, to complete more objectives, gain more victory points or even screw your rivals a little! Good addictive fun, really accessible to new gamers. 

Introduce a draft variant ala 7 wonders to improve the game and make it more strategic, deal 4 cards instead of three at the beginning, discard the last card. Up to 7.5 just for the use of this rule.

I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of decision making baked into the game. Luck plays a huge role but there's enough strategy to keep the gameplay satisfying. It's simple enough that kids can play it and do well but adults have enough to do to remain engaged.

RATING: 6.5
It's very lightweight, but the theme gives the impression that it's more of a gamer's game than it is.  Comparing it to my collection, based on play time, depth, luck vs decisions, and player count, I might equate it most closely to Pack & Stack, which I really enjoy.  There is just enough decision making to feel like you can put together a mild strategy, but you're still largely basing your points on draw probabilities.  I'm not sure the game is long enough to warrant going some of the special scoring objective cards -- just getting the high point cards seems like a solid approach.  I'm also not thrilled with the frequent interruptions as everyone has to stop every few draws while someone completes a card.  I like the game, but for the same feel I think there are other games I would rather play that are more non-gamer approachable.

Often referred to as "gamer's bingo", which is probably the most fitting description to this game. It takes the mechanics of bingo and makes it more strategic. You draw symbols from the bag and if you have it, you can put a single token on one of those symbols. The point is to try and finish your cards in order to both score points, earn bonuses and to trigger actions to make finishing other cards easier.

It's a nice game that has a nice mixture of strategic thinking and luck of the draw.

RATING: 8
This is a terrific light-medium gateway game.  Note, it isn't medium-light ;-)  It is fantastic for what it does, but it remains lighter than I'd prefer, at first blush.  There are more decisions to be made than it first appears, however, and I will happily play this anytime.

Some key elements:  plays up to 6 without much added time for high player counts.  Very approachable, but definitely has some strategy.  Can be played casually, but someone who is really trying hard and paying close attention (especially to other's tableaus) can easily win.

This game is somewhat mysterious to me, in that it does seem to have quite a lot of luck, and yet is quite moreish. I have enjoyed this with my wife, 4 year old and seven year old, and from early plays, it seems everyone is in with a chance - suggesting there is quite a lot of luck involved. Both my children have won. That said, after a couple of games, certain strategies do make a difference. Fundamentally, it's simple family fun. 'Ave Caesar!'

This one is a great game to pull out with new players, especially if you explain that they need to think of it like playing bingo with strategy. This one also works fairly well with six. I seem to enjoy games that have things coming out of bags. The ability to tie different cards together to increase score and when to grab the card bonuses all work together really well.

Ave Caesar! A light but very entertaining family game. We were only going to play this once but after the first game, my wife asked for another one and then another one... seems like an instant hit!

A reasonable little filler. From the design of the game I think this is setting itself up to be the next Dominion with a squillion and seven expansions.

The game is quite enjoyable with a simple draw-from-the-bag mechanic but I'm not sure it one that I'd like to play as a 'first option' game or even for a particularly long period as I see this very much as a filler. A filler with fine production values but a filler nonetheless.

I can't see me purchasing this game but probably wouldn't turn down a game if offered and I only had a short playing window.

Don't dismiss this game as "bingo" - there are a lot of games that revolve around pulling tokens from a bag. This has sufficient depth with the card combinations to be a great family game which will also appeal to hardened gamers.

RATING: 7
Using a 'bingo' style of play, each player is trying to complete a series of icons on various cards in order to complete them and earn points and/or powers to further their cause. 

There is no control in how those tokens are drawn to complete icons however...it is almost pure luck. I say almost as their is some probability analysis that the players can implement.

This is largely the game but the other half of the pllay is all about carefully selecting the Objectives that a payer is trying to complete in order to acquire a range of Reward Tiles that are worth extra VPs.

This game is very light and that makes it an excellent family game and a gateway title to entice non-gamer friends and family. 

For me though the lack of control and interesting decisions is just too great and although it is a quick experience (15-30 minutes) I don't feel like I've enjoyed it enough by the time the game is over.

Best player numbers are 4-5 I think.

Bingo for gamers, but it works great with non-gamers as well. Not a good 2p game though, due to the runaway leader problem that exists. At this point, I really think this game needs an expansion.

In terms of game mechanics, this game might be called "glorified" BINGO, but for me that is a selling point since I and (lets face it) tons of other people have been playing BINGO and loving it forever which makes this game dead simple to explain to new players.

BUT here's the thing, this game totally elevates BINGO to a whole new level, this is NOT your grandma's BINGO.

For one thing it's got theme, perhaps not the most scintillating theme (I'm no judge since I am super excited about ancient cultures), but it certainly is more exciting than no theme at all and I absolutely stand by the stunning artwork. BUT more importantly there are actual decisions to be made, and tactics to be employed in this game. There is push-your-luck, set collection, and special powers. Strategy comes into play, and risk management. It is a neat, fast-playing package that keeps players involved at all times. SWEET!

RATING: 7
In Rome, players compete to finish objectives and earn bonus VP tiles. There are 23 tiles in a bag (6 swords, 5 helmets, 4 catapaults, etc) and a town crier draws out one of the tiles. Players then match the drawn out tile to one of their 3 objective cards which have 2-6 of these symbols on it. You have 7 meeples to place on all your objectives, and once an objective is complete, you draw another one, putting back into play those meeples. You earn bonus VPs for the number of objectives you complete, and the type of objectives. 

It's a fun filler. Certainly there is luck, but I believe you can try your best to play the percentages in your favor. The more players there are, the more chaotic it will be with all sorts of cards resolving and potentially affecting your game. It's fresh, and it always has one of those "one more time" feels to it.

It's in the same league as 7wonders in my opinion and I hope they make a good expansion for this one (not that I feel the need for it).

[Rise of] Augustus has been called 'gamer bingo' and the description is apt. Little is involved in this most basic of Set Collection games. Nice components, nice art, plays quick, but too simple for my tastes. Other than the theme this is a children's game.

RATING: 8
Pick a piece out of the bag, if you have that on one of your objectives place a guy, if you don't, wait.  Once you get your objective full with guys you scream, 'AVE CAESER!' and complete your objective by using it's ability and picking a new one.  Plan smart, because it is not a race and if you finish early you could STILL lose to the guy with only 4 completed objectives (7 ends the game).

Short playing time, Bingo, and 7 Wonders feel to this one.  I thoroughly enjoyed my only play so far.

Slower than bingo, on which it's based, because everyone's got decisions to make among the 5 face up cards. The mode changes quickly from engine-building to VP scoring. Fun enough for all the luck involved.

They say, and in fact it's a gamer's bingo and, when you read the rules, it doesn't seem fun. But the gaming experience is completely different. 

You ghave to take enough decisions to develop a strategy, and even if the game is light, it has something, and it plays out quite fast.

I was not interested at all by this game, but I changed my opinion almost completely after playing.

I think it's a good as gateway or family game, or even for occasional gamers.

First impression (5 players): 
Well .. it's slightly better than bingo. Best part of the game was it reminding me of my childhood and times when I played Bingo with my granny. I wasn't impressed. There is a bit of game there in selecting right cards (to build) but I would like to play a bit more than that. 

Some games create illusion of control even though theres isn't much, Augustus manages to do exact opposite (with the little of control there is).

RATING: 5
Giochino senza troppe pretese, da molti definito una sorta di tombola. Effettivamente Augustus si ispira al classico vecchio gioco provando ad aggiungere qualche altro aspetto per rendere il tutto un po' più articolato e un pizzico strategico. Il gioco resta però molto governato dalla pesca dei tasselli (che sostituiscono i numeri) che permettono di fare ambo, terna o urlare Tomb... ehm... Ave Cesare! Paolo Mori partendo da Ur e Vasco da Gama e passando per Liberalia continua la sua perdita di profondità e complessità per passare a prodotti sempre più orientati verso le famiglie, ricevendo tra l'altro apprezzamenti come la Nomination allo Spiel des Jahres. Questa scelta però non soddisfa i miei gusti che ripensa con nostalgia al vecchio Vasco da Gama.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Giving gamer credentials to what is essentially a game of Bingo takes some balls. Augustus isn't all that bad, but there's a feeling there's quite a lot of control missing, despite all the designer's best efforts to nullify the random chit draw. The special abilities feel like they needed more testing.

[i]Another okay family game. It is an interesting take on Bingo, but there isn't much there besides that. Collecting the different catds for abilities/points is an okay add on to the Bingo mechanic, but I can't see it remaining interesting for multiple plays since the interactions/bonus actions are so basic. I'd play it again, but I don't need to own it.[/i]

Um jogo rápido, viciante, e fácil de explicar. O fator sorte por frustrar aquele jogador mais estratégico. Ele é um "bingo" com um pouco de tática. Botei o jogo na mesa e jogamos 2 horas seguidas sem parar! Em várias partidas você consegue seguir algum padrão de ganhar pontos, a depender dos objetivos expostos na mesa, e claro, da sorte de completá-los. Eu recomendo esse jogo para jogadores casuais. É um bom filler para jogar diversas partidas sem sentir o tempo passar. PS: Agradeço ao vídeo do Igor Knop por me "apresentar" esse jogo onde aqui em casa todos adoraram.

A fun game of completing cards and collecting victory points all in the old fashioned style of Bingo. Each player begins with three cards and 7 meeples. A disc will be drawn randomly and each player covers that symbol on one of their 3 cards with a meeple. When a card is completely covered the player gains a special power, or end game victory points. The first player to collect certain sets of cards will gain victory tiles. And the first to finish with 7 cards triggers scoring. 

So far this game is seeing a lot of plays. It's always easy to play. The cards are square over sized cards. This is a problem because there are currently no sleeves available for this size. For such a game that will see lots of plays this spells trouble for the cards lasting.

A sprightly little filler. Haters will say the central mechanic is bingo, which might be right but is actually really cool mechanic: everyone plays simultaneously; the distribution of symbols changes with each pull.

There is definitely some strategy both in terms of which objective you choose and which order you complete them.

The box is really massive though considering what's inside. It could easily fit into one of those FFG small card game boxes. Also it's crying out for advanced rules promoting player interaction and maybe making use of some of the other commodities printed on the 'province objectives'.

*起始目標卡洗勻開五張，獎勵卡打開放置，所有圓片丟袋中
*每人拿7個米寶，目標卡抽6選3
*遊戲進行多輪直到有人完成七個目標結束計分，每輪流程如下
1.玩家從袋中抽一個圓片，所有人根據此圓片圖案放一個米寶在目標卡上對應欄位
2.有目標卡的欄位被放置完就可以結算該卡放到控制區並執行右上獎勵
*多人同時完成左下數字小的先結算
*移人的效果對放滿要結算的卡片無效
3.如果符合獎勵卡就拿獎勵卡，獎勵卡分三種。綠色的符合條件可拿不會被搶，目標卡張數的每人只能拿一張，所以要拿高分的就要跳過低分的，資源的當下完成對應資源時如果卡牌是最多的就拿到面前(平手也拿，可從別人那邊搶)
4.袋子交給下個玩家，如果此輪抽到百搭，則所有圓片丟回袋中
*遊戲在有玩家完成七張目標卡時結算，加總獎勵卡/完成目標卡左下分數，分數最高獲勝，平手比議員卡的數量

It's like Bingo turned into a real game. Choose what cards you want to commit to building - each will have different build requirements, different VP's, different completion effects, and will help you towards the various bonus tiles awarded to those who complete this or that fastest. Then the drawing of tiles commences. As each tile is drawn it may or may not help towards a build requirement on one of your tiles. As the last build req on a tile is done, complete it and choose / draw another, aiming to get 7 done as fast as possible to end the game, but not really caring who ends the game as long as you have the most VP's. It drags a bit when there are multiple completions in quick order and people are deliberating over what card to go for next, but that should speed up with repeat play. There's some probability analysis to be done, balancing of tiles and build requirements, effect synergies ... lots of things to take into consideration ... and then it comes down to the drawing of the tiles. It's a nice lightweight Euro affair for those who don't mind a ton of luck to see how their selections fare.

RATING: 8
"Fun and quick (30-45 minutes with 4-6p first-timers) game for gamers and non-gamers alike. More strategy than some say but obviously a lot of randomness too."

What I like:
- Fun mechanism of a common chit draw
- Plays very fast even with 5 or 6 (a 5p learning game took 23 minutes, although a 4p took 40)
- Good ratio of decisions to time and complexity
- I just leave out the 8 red "attack" cards, and the game plays fine

What I don't like:
- The widely varied bonuses are a bit hard to explain
- A few rules are unclear (despite a generally good rulebook)

This is a really clever design, and an enjoyable light (but not featherweight) game. I think it should have won the SdJ over Hanabi.

I would put the weight right around 2.0, probably because I see a bit more depth in it than BGG voters do so far.

RATING: 6
Descriptions of this as "gamer bingo" are apt.  Players have a number of cards with symbols on them, one player draws chips with those symbols from a bag, and players may fulfill that symbol on a card.  Once a card is completed, the player gains a benefit and gets a new card.  I thought introducing a game with the bingo mechanic that actually had real decisions to make was very clever.  On the other hand, there were a lot of extremely harsh take-that cards that left a bad taste in my mouth.

Exactly as it sounds, gamer bingo. I actually rather enjoyed this game. Yes there is luck and yes, there isn't a TON of thought to this game, but it was rather enjoyable.

A pleasant surprise.  I liked the simultaneous play of acquiring resources and allocating them.  The interaction of getting the bonuses or senators/lands were pretty good, too.  I liked the wild mechanism and tile powers which helped getting the harder to get resources.  I liked the reallocation of resources, too, when near the limit or tile which won't be completed.

Some of the tile powers weren't always intuitive and had to refer to the rules.  Additionally, some were swingy, like giving up a completed tile, which I thought were too strong.

"When Bingo meets 7 wonders" is a somewhat accurate description of this game. This game is really light, so it probably won't go to an 8 on the rating scale where I will suggest it often. It will probably be a game that I'd play with my parents when I want some strategies involved and yet not too much that it scares away my mom. It scales well from 2 to 6 even though I've only had experience with 2 player game with my girlfriend as of now. I will see if more players can bump this rating up to an 8. I solely got this game because of it's gateway-ness and also scales up to "6", which is a magical number in board gaming.

---- Update ----
Rating goes from 7 to 8 with more plays and found out this game is very well designed with a good balance of luck and strategy for a family game. This has become a stable of 6 player game that I will bring out when there is a crowd.

---- Update ----
Perhaps there is too much luck than I like so rating goes back down to 7.

---- Update ----
With Wits and Wagers, 7 Wonders, and Wits and Wagers battling for the 6+ player spot this game lost its shine quite easier. Rating from 7->6.

Surprisingly fun for such a light game. Despite the core of the game being taking tiles from a bag and see if they match the symbols on your cards (a *lot* like bingo), it nevertheless has room for decisions on which cards (I mean, "objectives") to go for - as your chips (I mean "legions") are limited. Plus, completed objectives give you special powers - and looking for effective combos becomes key to winning. Highly recommended as a gateway game - my 6-year old son is a fan - and particularly for teaching the mechanic of interacting cards.

RATING: 7
8+(8+); 2-6 (3-4); 30mins

First full game (minus 6 card hand selection) using Augustus promo: I find this design provides a better feel of the different roles in Roman society than Tribune: this is mainly because the rules intro calls the players legates, with provinces and senators to be conquered and controlled, again the rules stating the wealthiest legate will be given the title of consul by the senate at game end. So the situations are understandable and titles easy to apply than the abstracted roles in Tribune.

Yet you feel because of the bingo mechanic it is a heads down and race, with little regard to how your opponents are running (mainly obscured by the fractured and variable vp status), someone (hopefully you) blows the end game whistle then you look up to see who has won. This mechanism seems to reduce the sense of competitive tension, though obviously the bonus tiles are bones of contention, but I think the overall issue is that it is difficult to relate to your opponent(s) because of the card design and the table gets 'cluttered' with icons/images etc.

You can't help but feel a lot of luck is involved, but again you are trying to mitigate this with tactical card selection. 

The little boosts in objectives and tiles plus the profit sequencing of your objectives make the run interesting, though it is difficult to referee but at the moment will keep it.

RATING: N/A
An odd one. The way the game is designed is to have a quick-playing Bingo-ish game of simultaneous turns. But there are so many icons and things to track, and so much churn of the available cards, that the game doesn't take full advantage of the snappy turns. Maybe with enough experience the players can learn to scan things a bit quicker to see where their opponents are with their progress (and since there's very little direct influence anyway, maybe it's not important to track this stuff in the first place). We tend to play it when we have 6p and we can bang it out in about 30ish minutes. 

The box size is also, frankly, stupid. I ditched the box and keep everything in an unused box that once had an Agricola expansion deck in it. Yes, you read that correctly: I fit everything from a square family game box into the same box that a single deck of cards came in. That's inexcusably horrible.

Great family game.  Very dependent on luck, but, because of the abbreviated play time, it remains a fun and often suspenseful experience. After multiple plays, it is clear that, although luck is often a deciding factor, there is still quite a bit of strategy involved and quite a few meaningful decisions that need to be made during the course of each game.

Rise of Augustus does plenty of things right. It's a great looking game that plays quick and is easy to teach. Really, the whole thing flows very smoothly. That being said, I think I was a victim of hype for this one. I expected it to be simple, but I'm just not sure there's much game here. I like the way card effects chain and it's easy enough to plan ahead, but I feel like a lot of the fun is lost in the way points are scored. Choosing to claim a tile or not just doesn't hold much weight.

Overall, I wouldn't turn down a game of Augustus, but I don't see much point in going out of my way for a game.

Roman Bingo??  Count me in!

Good gateway game.  Easy to comprehend.....no rules explanation necessary.  Just start playing.  You learn the specifics within the first 5 minutes of the first game.

The game can be played at various levels.  I played with a guy who had fun just playing a bingo-like game.  No strategic thought into which card to draw....or what bonuses to go for.

The strategy and optimizing your card draw will happen very quickly once you understand the basic game mechanics.

Augustus did for Bingo what Trajan did for Mancala (but at a much simpler level).  Recommended.

Light weight family game.  Pretty fun, but we play without the double-penalty objective cards because they are too penalizing.  The effects on some of the other objective cards are a little unbalanced, so whoever happens to get the objectives with the more powerful effects has a better chance of winning.  But for some, this luck factor might be what makes the game fun.

Or as we call it 'Domus'.  It's like a Euro version of Bingo.  You collect up sets of different Roman symbols till you can acquire the goal card you are after, then you can use its powers and gain victory points for collecting different sets of goals.  In our family, we call out 'Domus' (Latin for 'house', as in Bingo) when we have finished a goal.  Fun, quick, fairly simple game with different strategies and lots of luck.

This game uses a bingo mechanic and really ramps it up to a nice family game.  There is a strategy to picking your next cards and to try to have you cards positively effect each other.

I really liked this and it's a good game to play with families or with beer and pretzels.

Imagine playing Bingo and putting a little bit of a strategy game around it. Yeah, not my idea of fun. Yes, I did say Bingo (except you say "Ave" instead of "Bingo") - that is what this game is.

In my one game playing, I did win the game, simply because I was able to take a card that allowed me to convert resources early. I then used that card to score one that gave me two extra meeples. I focused on getting more cards converting resources (I had 3 at the end) and I was just able to dominate this game easily. Luck on certain cards being available it critical in this game.

Also, the components. WHY IS THE BOX SO BIG FOR THIS GAME??!?! Seriously, such a waste of space in my shelf. I received Lobotomy recently. With the expansion, I can just about get everything into the box. Good box design. With this game, there is so much wasted space. Seriously, the components for this game could fit easily into your pocket. You buy this game and assume that you're going to get a big game out of it, you'll be very disappointed. IF (very big if) we keep this, it will be put into a much smaller box for storage.

The only possible redeeming features of this game are
1. Plays through in 30 minutes.
2. Can stretch to 6 players.
3. Easy to understand, can be a gateway game.

Not a game I'd bother suggest playing. We actually bought this recently and haven't opened it. Being still in shrink wrap should increase it's trade value! The fact that it can play 6 players and we have a lack of this kind of game, covering this many players, means that we will probably keep it for a while.

initially had the impression is confirmed: fun and intuitive

although the mechanism known (bingo?) has been improved thanks to the interaction and the presence of actions to be done as soon as the card is completed you can go to combo.

the limited duration gives the opportunity to make more matches in one evening.

The red card is really interesting and really give bastardate goduriose.

It will be my next purchase

A very light--but not ultra-light or mindless--Euro. I favor medium-to-heavy games myself, as a rule. But I liked Augustus after just a few plays, my kids like it too...an instant family winner. Very mild strategy in what objectives to go after and when, some very mild "take that" opportunities. Plays really quick, 30 minutes is a true estimate. Quicker even. No player elimination, almost no down time. Very few components, so little bumper time. Probably a bit too much luck, sure, and maybe a runaway leader problem, but oh well. It is a short game so it's less a big deal. This game works for me and my family. Best family game of 2013.

A 2013-as SdJ egyik jelöltje könnyed, családi szórakozást nyújt, római kori bingó formájában. A téma szerint egy consuli státuszért versengünk, légióinkkal a legtöbb presztízst jelentő provinciákat akarjuk irányítani, és a legbefolyásosabb személyiségek támogatását megnyerni. 
A bingó lapokon lévő szimbólumok nem egyforma számban vannak a zsákban, és az egyes lapok szinergiája is más és más, ráadásul némelyik a játék végén ad bónuszpontokat. Extra járhat még a szettekért, bizonyos terményeket előállító provinciákért is.

Viszont a játéknak nagyon hamar vége szakad - mindössze 7 kártyát kell megoldani valakinek, és van amelyikhez csak két nagy esélyű húzás kell. 

Ha van egy okos telefon/tablet a környéken, mindenképpen érdemes a Layar-al szkennelni a játék dobozát!

I have a hard time rating this game. The bingo mechanism is easy to grasp and fun to play, but the cards seem very unbalanced. You may lose by a lot without having done anything wrong. Though there is a lot on criticism on e rulebook, I didn't have any problems with it.

Very light and I keep telling myself it's Bingo taken up a couple of notches with the card selection, but it's just so swingy in the final stages to be taken seriously. That said the family seem to get a kick out of it. Light enough that they can just enjoy the ride, groans and race to the bonus tiles. So it gets an okay rating from me. I love the theme and the detail put into the cards, but am just a little disappointed that it wasn't taken to another level. I don't mind the Bingo so much - that could just as easily have been replaced by a similar dice mechanic - it's just that the whole package is a bit light for me.

Upon further play I can't help feel disappointed that the game seems to be half done. There's so much more that could have been done with the card abilities. It could have been much more.

From the various bands and orchestras and choirs I have been a part of, I have learned that it's difficult to be quiet/soft and make good music just as much as it is hard to also make good music being loud, too.

I feel the same about certain games: a game that is both simple and good is difficult to achieve, probably more so than a game that is both complex but also good.

Augustus is simple, but definitely not dumb and boring. It's really good! It is simple enough to draw in the younger kids, but intriguing enough for my wife and I to enjoy the game.

The modified bingo rules are exciting. The card powers and chaining add depth. The bonus tiles give some "press your luck" and interaction. But it all remains simple and straight forward.

This was definitely a great purchase that will be easy to play with a lot of people in the years to come.

If I'd been told I'd be playing Bingo with a Roman theme I think I'd have turned my nose up at the prospect! However, this is a fun little game, very easy to teach and to play and certainly with somewhat more strategic input than Bingo, thankfully. Plays quickly and whilst I wouldn't want this to be the main attraction on a games night, it's short, light, somewhat more than "filler" status, and worth a try.

"Gamer Bingo" as this was introduced to me was a fun time.  Not a lot of depth, but more enjoyable than a lot of fillers.  You can see an expansion or two on the horizon with all of the different goods that aren't being used on the cards.  You can get stuck if the cards coming up aren't in your strategy's favor, but I liked it.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Yep, it's Bingo: the Euro Game.

Mikor megnéztem Tom Vasel bemutatóját a játékról kicsit felháborodtam, hogy egy ilyen játék hogyan lehet év játéka jelölt, amit anno olyan játékok kaptak meg, mint a Torres, Tikal, stb. Ez a játék meg sem közelíti ezek szintjét és még akkor is elfogadhatatlannak érzem kicsit, ha tudom, hogy most már külön kezelik a gémer és családi játékokat. A játék a Bingó egy kis római körítéssel. A játékosok egy zsákból különböző számú és fajtájú jelölőket húznak, amik után az adott jelölből egyre az előttük levő három célra ráraknak egy emberüket. Ez így megy tovább, amíg a célok minden jelölőjét nem fedi egy emberük, ekkor a cél teljesült és húznak újat. Érdekességet csak annyi visz a játékba, hogy a különböző célok különböző dolgokat adnak a győzelmi ponton kívül, illetve különböző módon adnak győzelmi pontot. A játékban van még pár bónusz győzelmi pont és ennyi. Amint valaki hét célt teljesít a játék véget ér. Bárki játszhatja, gyors, könnyű, igazából semmi stratégiát nem igénylő játék. Igaz bármikor játszható, de szerintem semmi kihívást nem adó társas az Augustus. Gyerekekkel, idősekkel tényleg játszható, de gémerek kerüljék.

This game will inevitably remind you of Bingo. A token is drawn and then everyone sees if they can mark it down on one of their three objectives and whoever completes an objective, shouts "Bin...", I mean "Ave Cesar!". Sounds simplistic? Maybe, but the game is heaps of fun. I love the theme, mechanics, presentation, simultaneous turns and easily explained and understood symbols (instead of heaps of text like in too many other games). Plays quick and then you can play again. The only thing I don't like is the ridiculously oversized box and the lack of an expansion even four years later, even though the manual and the cards themselves clearly hint it was planned.

After 10 plays, downgraded from an 8 to a 6. Runaway leader potential is high and you can be pretty much screwed from the opening 6 card draw, as I was the last four games.

Will try again where six cards for each player are placed in an opening pool, the Catan style, all players draft one card at a time, reversing direction once each player has chosen one. 

Also, all those extra resources on cards are begging for an expansion -- which this game seems to need on more than that account.

It's a game with some decisions, just not very many. It's pretty fun for what it is and it only slows down a bit when someone draws a new card. In order to keep fresh, the game needs an expansion to fill the ridiculously oversized box.

RATING: 6.5
The game could also go by "Roman Bingo": it is very simple, with sort of a push-your-luck set-collection mechanism and only a few real choices (starting cards, replacement cards, whether or not to move your meeples, when to claim some of the bonus tiles). Still, the choices matter, it's a quick game, and it works pretty well! 

There is a deck of people and region cards, each requiring a different combination of icons to be built. They are worth a range of VP, and may have powers that activate instantly or give additional VP at the end of the game.  The region cards come in one of 3 colors (green, orange, pink). At the start of the game, players get 6 of these cards; keep 3, remove the rest from the game; put 5 face up in display. Also put several bonus tiles on display: these can be claimed by achieving various conditions (e.g., collect 3 people, collect a region in each of the 3 colors, have the largest collection of gold or wheat icons on cards collected) and are worth 2-10 VP each. Players each get 7 meeples.

Each turn, a player pulls a token out of a bag. The tokens have pictures matching one of the icons on the cards (plus 1 wild); the distribution of the icons is indicated on the player aids. Players place one of their meeples on a matching space on any of their cards; if all 7 have been used, may move a previously placed meeple. If you cover all the icons, you call "Augustus!". Use whatever power there is on the card (if any), add the card to your score pile, optionally claim one or more bonus tiles, and replace that card with one chosen from the display (refill the spot immediately). If more than one person calls Bingo/Augustus, resolve according to the numbers on the cards (lower goes earlier). If the wild is drawn, all tiles are returned to the bag before drawing the next token.

The game ends when any player has collected 6 cards; most VP wins!

This is gamer's Bingo.  The game is played with one player drawing disks from a bag denoting different symbols.  All players have objectives with different symbols on them and can cover up a symbol matching the one drawn.  When they cover all the symbols they shout Bing...er, Ave Caesar!

Where it becomes gamer's Bingo and not just Bingo is that these objectives not only score you points but also provide certain bonuses such as covering up additional symbols for free, providing more legions (used to cover up the symbols, which each player only starts with 7), or even attacking other players.  There are also global goals players can achieve for more points.

The game is certainly light and easy to teach...I mean, it's Bingo after all.  Surprisingly though I quite liked it.  There is a decent amount of strategy and some things to grok in this game while also that little amount of luck to make things not so deterministic.  That combined with the ease of entry and quick playing time earned it a spot on my shelf.

How on earth was this short listed for the SDJ? Competitive bingo with players  completing cards which give victory points and powers. The game slows to a crawl as players have to analyse their cards and their effects and their symbols comparing them with their own tableau. Ah own tableaux! To be able to make sensible choices they need to know what's on their opponents cards - which slows the game down. Cool idea for a mechanic, does not work as a casual game I think, more as a novelty for gamers.

Described to me as "Gamer's Bingo", you place centurions on your cards based on which tiles are pulled from a bag. When you complete a tile, you shout "Ave Caesar!", score the tile and draw a new one. It's a nice filler game.

This isn't a bad game. It's simple rules make it a great fit for families. And it has just enough in it that it might make a good trainer for the budding strategist in your household. However, I found it to be a little too simplistic for repeated plays with experienced gamers, and lucking into the gold and wheat cards early made for unsatisfying wins.

The game isn't all luck. There are clear strategies to winning, but they are pretty simple to understand. There are a few different tactical choices to be made, but their availability to a given player always depends on when those cards show up in the display. Once someone takes a large lead, there really doesn't seem to be much of a way to catch them. Most mechanisms seem to put the leader even further in the lead.

RATING: 5
Engine-building bingo: tiles with Roman-themed symbols are drawn from a bag; if a player has a matching symbol on one of their objective cards then a worker can be placed there. Completing a card is worth end-game points and either a one-off or continuous benefit. 

It's a solid gateway game with some strategic choices and, most importantly, many moments where you sit in tense anticipation on the edge of your seat: a chariot, my kingdom for a chariot!

There are two reasons it fails for me, besides the superficial (ridiculous oversize box) and obvious (strong influence of luck): firstly, that selecting a new objective is the most strategic decision in the game but is both tedious and potentially time-consuming (I need these symbols, I have end-game points from that, etc.); and secondly, that it is sufficiently difficult to track what opponents are doing, let alone deliberately interfere, that it does not feel at all interactive.

RATING: 7
Sort of a slimmer, trimmer game with many of the good qualities of Seven Wonders.  A lot of cards pass through your hands and you try to make the best of them.  If your choices are favored by the tile-bag luck of the draw, you have a good chance to win -- but it's better if you made smart choices in the first place.  PS:  Here's why I'm bumping this down to a 7.  As much fun as the fast pace of filling up your cards may be, the game has to come to a dead halt over and over when it is time for a player to pick a new card from the display.

Quite enjoyable, but oh what a ridiculous oversized box. Shame on you - this should have been a lot smaller, and would then have been played a lot more because at the moment this comes out of the bag, and something meatier goes in.

Bingo-flavoured Civ-lite. Pull a chit, then lucky players queue up to pick a new card. The more players there are, the more frequently these scoring phases happen, so there's a continual interruption to the game.

Paolo Mori is one of the most clever boardgame designer in Italy, but the taste for this game is far away from his best productions. Set collection + card drafting mechanics means strategic suicide!

I had never played Bingo. Apparently now I have. And I must say, I don't feel the urge to play real Bingo any time soon. So you can choose to go for cars that have a better chance of being completed statistically. And you might still get hosed by luck of the draw, and there is nothing you can do about it. OK, I get it, this is a light filler game, but even then there are plenty of other luck driven games I'd rather play than this one. And the reason is that this game gives you the unjustified feeling that your decisions matter. They don't.

Described as bingo in Rome. And it really is. The only choices are:

1) Where to allocate your soldiers (obvious)
2) Whether to take a scoring token (obvious)
3) Which mission to take next (requires mild thought)
4) Whether to use any of your abilities (almost always obvious)

And yet, somehow, this was quite fun... There is no element of skill and I suspect my dog would beat me twice in every five plays, but it was oddly playable. I am currently unsure exactly why.

A fairly innocuous way to pass the time, but utterly random. This game is often compared to bingo, but at least everyone has an equal chance throughout bingo. In Augustus, one or two people will randomly get the draws they need, get an engine going that helps them complete more cards and then blow everyone else away. I guess that's the "fun" of the game ... but not if you're one of the people who never gets their engine spinning because the right symbols weren't randomly drawn ...

Gamer bingo. Perfectly light and length is perfect. It feels like they designed the game to have a bunch of expansions that never materialized.

Bingo for table top players.
Has a similar vibe to 7 Wonders, which I love.
You can really get shafted though because the first player to complete an objective has a pretty good advantage of winning the whole thing.
It's kind of too fast because once a player completes seven objectives, the game is over, and I would often only have three completed objectives.

While the game of Bingo is older than dirt - it's use as a game mechanic is predominantly new. 

Does a simple mechanic equate to a simple game?  Well, yes in this case it does - and like the food on offer in a real Bingo hall, there are very few delicious choices here.  It also suffers from the rich get richer syndrome.     

Now,  if it only came with ping pong balls and a bingo machine.....

Perfect for families with young gamers, my 5 year old can play this just fine.

Fun, quick little worker placement game that might also be called "Roman Bingo". There's enough strategy to be fun, but not so much extraneous BS that it detracts from it. The problem is that we just don't really like it. I liked it the first time, but not after.

Good little game, but only if you like ultra-random, push your luck games.

RATING: 6
Good family game, scratches the same itch as 7 wonders, not as deep yet quick, fairly replayable and fun.

I love games that don't waste my time and augustus is a fine example of this category. Great flow of play, few but meaningfull decisions, good interaction, beautiful compontents, a fair theme, excellent variety and replayability, it keeps all players involved.. all this in a less than half an hour package. Apparently there is only one reply after a game of augustus: let's start another one! Luck in this game is present but it isn't dominating. Skill still matters.

It's also not bingo. I had no idea what bingo was (yes we ignorant people exist), so once I played augustus I thought: it must be a great game! Then a friend explained what bingo is and I was shocked - bingo is not actually a game (for me at least). Saying that Augustus is like bingo equals to saying that Feld's Macao is like rolling dice.

Negative points: I personally love the theme, but I can see how it may pass as completely indifferent to many players. The serious problem is that there are good cards and bad cards - although their value changes situationally - which means your starting trio may be poor due to luck. The worst thing is that this significantly hurts replayability as a result.

To sum it up: this is a decent family/gateway/friendly game that could have been excellent with a more balanced card design.

This game was introduced to me as Gamer's Bingo. I think that does it a bit of a disservice but I understand why it's called that. After all, the game has a "caller" and you put markers on your boards if you have the called symbol.

But a couple of things actually make this a game. You get to choose which cards you get. You know the distribution of the tiles that are drawn. You have limited meeples and sometimes have to decide if you leave a guy on one card or move him to another. There are bonuses that you can be working towards. And completed cards have special abilities, like letting you move two meeples to another card, or convert any tiles from one symbol to another. So there's actually decisions to be made, unlike Bingo.

Yes, there's a fair bit of luck here. But given that this is a short filler and there's also some strategy, I think the game works for what it is.

This game has been called gamer Bingo, and sometimes it's used as a good thing, and sometimes as a bad thing. It's a good thing for me.  I really enjoy this game.  It's associations with Bingo seems to automatically give people a bad taste for it in gamer circles and that's unfortunate.  I think it's a light, fun, quick time.  People I play it with always seem to enjoy it, and once everybody has a couple games under their belts the apparent lack of strategy melts away.  I think you can play this game at a pretty high level of strategy and that's when it really shines.

Augustus is a variation of bingo, plain and simple. While one may point to the increase in complexity of the game with the emergence of common objectives as well as various tile powers, I still would describe this game as merely a souped up bingo. Basically, the core mechanic does not change. Draw tile, resolve position of legion on tile, claim objective, rinse and repeat.

Yet, there is something engaging about playing a simple game. Unlike complicated games, simple and easy games trigger a different sort of delight that a complex game cannot achieve. Part of the attraction is the inclusiveness of such a game for a broader audience. Being able to play with folks that is not normally a gamer can be a delightful surprise. Such is the case with Augustus.

Beautiful artwork, short playtime, and very easy rules make this an appealing game for those looking for lighter fare.  This is a good match for a group that doesn't quite want a party game, but wants something of the corresponding ease and timing. For those interested in heavier games, there's not a whole lot here.  There aren't many strategic choices, and the objectives you can vie for are often severely restricted by the card draw.  The game's main mechanic is a bingo variant and while it makes the game very fast to explain, it does get repetitive quickly.

Though the mechanics are very abstract, the game does make some attempts to be thematic.  The different objectives that relate to historic provinces in the Roman Empire,  have lush art that indicates what products the region was associated with, even though most of them have no bearing on gameplay.  Vincent Dutrait's art pops and makes what could be a real snoozer into a treat for the eyes.

A 2013-as SdJ egyik jelöltje könnyed, családi szórakozást nyújt, római kori bingó formájában. A téma szerint egy consuli státuszért versengünk, légióinkkal a legtöbb presztízst jelentő provinciákat akarjuk irányítani, és a legbefolyásosabb személyiségek támogatását megnyerni. 
A bingó lapokon lévő szimbólumok nem egyforma számban vannak a zsákban, és az egyes lapok szinergiája is más és más, ráadásul némelyik a játék végén ad bónuszpontokat. Extra járhat még a szettekért, bizonyos terményeket előállító provinciákért is.
Viszont a játéknak nagyon hamar vége szakad - mindössze 7 kártyát kell megoldani valakinek, és van amelyikhez csak két nagy esélyű húzás kell. 
Ha van egy okos telefon/tablet a környéken, mindenképpen érdemes a Layar-al szkennelni a játék dobozát!

UPDATE: After eight plays, it's for trade. Unexpanded, it doesn't have the variety to remain interesting and it's not as good as a gateway game as games without complex iconography.

PERMANENT PLACE IN THE COLLECTION (at the moment)

Moderately random, but not devoid of skill and entertaining anyway. Yep, it's Roman bingo with special powers. Based on first play, I'm happy to play again, could probably carry on playing multiple rounds... And would suggest a game. So a score of 8 then...

RATING: 5
This is an amazingly short game for it to have as many rules as it does, and the game is actually pretty decent, all things considered.  I didn't like the way that the game can come down to when a certain card comes up, especially when you can have up to six players in the game.  Still, a game shouldn't last much longer than about 30-40 minutes, so it's not like you've sunk a lot of time into a game that causes some chaotic frustrations.

Jeu intéressant. Accessible, rapide à jouer. Un feeling de bingo, mais avec un peu de stratégie derrière le tout. Parfait après un gros jeu. Une fois que l'on passe par dessus la mécanique de "bingo" on voit toutes les possibilités stratégiques, en particulier dans le choix des cartes et dans l'ordre qu'on les complètes.

Bingo with a Roman theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There's a long tradition of repurposing old public domain mechanisms into modern Euro formats. Ticket to Ride is really just a riff on Rummy, Trajan and Finca took Mancala as their source material and now, Augustus has arived on the scene as a re-skinned version of Bingo.

It sounds pretty dumb at first blush. Pull a chit out of the bag and everyone at the table marks the designated symbol off their card. Complete your card and you win a prize (either victory points or a special ability for use in later rounds.)

It really is just Bingo, but it comes with a hair more control, to satisfy the modern gamer. First, the chit pull is weighted. Some symbols are more likely to appear than others. Next, many of the abilities that you unlock allow you to manipulate the chit pull, allowing you to apply marks to two or three different symbols in lieu of the one that was actually pulled.

Make no mistake, this doesn't make it heavy Euro fare, it's still Bingo. Rise of Augustus is most likely too simple for most established game groups. But I've found it to be a tremendously good game to play with the little ones. It's simple enough for them to understand the basic idea of putting a meeple on each space of the card when the appropriate token is drawn and then calling "Ave Caesar" when the card is full and collecting the points. I find myself enjoying the opportunity to play around in the system and engine build, while my daughter somewhat randomly makes moves in whatever manner it is that five-year-olds make decisions.

Final thoughts...It's much better than the elevator pitch would have you believe. Yes it is just Bingo and yes, it is too simple to deserve any real attention. But if you have kids and they are interested in gaming, you can do a lot worse than forty-five minutes with Rise of Augustus.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed the concept even if the luck of the draw made me frustrated at times.  Unfortunately, the draw bag's simpleness seems to be at odds with the harder iconography that is on all the cards. 

Ultimately I couldn't get anyone in my family or game group to give it another try once we went through the game once so it got traded away.

BUT I play this game regularly with the Middle School game group I supervise and we all love it... I guess it is just about personal taste!

RATING: 8
I played this several times while still a prototype: i liked the mechanics but i couldnt figure out excactly how to play it. Luckily, the published rethematization (is this even an english word?) is pretty good, with nice art and clear symbols and gameplay comes much more natural.
Rules are clear and strightforwards, the game is very very simple, fast paced and light but there's also some space for planning and combo-seeking. I cant even decide if it is a "filler" or not. Probably a good introduction to heavier games for younger players.
In my opinion the only shortcoming (but it can be considered an added value) is that a single game lasts not enough and it is over way too soon: instead of 7 cards, I would require to play till, say, 10.

We select bingo board objectives and activate them with bingo style tile draws that allow us to place our legionnaire meeples. Be the first to complete seven objectives.  Not sure why the theme is Roman Empire?  Seems like you could use this game system for any theme. I'm sure this could be said of many games but it stands out for me in particular. Short game, bingo draws introduce a fair bit of luck, not heavy with some interesting choices. Up to 6 players.

This game was a ton of fun for a group. The bingo-type mechanic allowed for great interactions as you can always blame the person with the bag for not pulling the token you need. The strategy is surprisingly deep for such a simple game: go for quantity and get bonus points before other players, go for the more difficult goals and earn special bonus points, or go for specific synergistic cards to improve your odds later in the game.

RATING: 3
This is one of those interesting occurrences where a game works much better on paper than in practice.  You'd never know from the rules that Augustus is a shocking waste of time, and yet it is.

What it boils down to is that players get into a vicious activity-pain-activity cycle, where each "activity" is a 2-second burst of meeple movement and each pain is an empty timeless void that lasts forever.

The system is simple, admittedly, and mechanically sound. Players call out symbols bingo-style, complete cards, and select replacements. At the end of the game, there are typical euro bonuses for stuff that I don't care about, but you just might.

The problem is that players take WAY too long to pick out their new cards, so every microsecond of gameplay is interrupted with 3 minutes of indecisive downtime.  And when multiple players complete their cards simultaneously, it just gets worse. My annoyance reached record levels in my first (and last) game, but since a [url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/]Guinness[/url] representative wasn't present it'll never be entered into the official hall of records.

So I won't be coming near this one again.  Wow, was this ever painful.

Has replaced the mindless filler, King of Tokyo, with my group
Finally something to play that has more weight and is just as quick.
It is very easy to teach and has more depth than first appeared.
Only reason this is not a 10, is this...

Rule book page 1, section 2, highlight III:
Situation and resources
produced. Only wheat and gold
resources are useful in the game.
The others are just for illustration ...

The (...). in every game I teach I am asked what the other resource symbols mean.
I am sure they are expansion fodder but it is the only negative thing I have seen from this game in multiple play throughs (besides not needing the scorepad, most of the games we played are in the 50-60 point range, scorepad not required).
Highly, highly recommended.

Accessible and moreish but without much depth. You really need to base your decisions on what the other players have in front of them but with a full table of players it's hard to see all the icons and in any case, such analysis would slow the game down to a crawl. It's already a bit boring when others have completed a card and called Ave Caesar and you have to wait for them to use their abilities and choose a new card. The game is enjoyable at a fast pace, but the jerky stops and starts when players complete objectives are frustrating.

This is a fun game, simple and light fare that anyone could learn to play. I've enjoyed it with some modded rules of having to complete ten objectives and also having a 6th face down "mystery" card for players to choose after completing an objective. It definitely adds excitement to the game. This is a good one though. Gamer bingo!

It can't be helped calling this "Bingo for gamers".  This turns the Bingo concept into something that I can call a game.  You still face the cruel possibility of things being called that you simply don't have… and it happening for a long time; however, you also get to make choices, and decide how to play the odds.  You also get to make strategic statistical choices, and strive for synergy between your cards; however, not only are you at the mercy of the items being called, you are also at the mercy of what comes available on the deck.  The art is quite nice, and it beats some of the truly mainstream games in the US, so I'd rather play this than certain other things, but I also am not likely to request it.

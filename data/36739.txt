Despite it's simplicity, this is easily one of the most-played games at our game night outings.  It's easy to learn, easy to set up, and fun to play, either by winning through luck, or winning through taking something your neighbor wanted.  It's poker, but your hand might be sheep full of pigs, rather than kings full of deuces.

Another take on [b]Schotten-Totten[/b], it has baffling production values: the cows and horses are hard to tell apart and the animal values are squint-tastic.  Some of the other parts are flimsy too, and the box is HUGE for the contents.

That having been said, this is quite a good game, and I'll pick it up.  Then demolish the box.  ;)

It is basically a poker game set on a farm where you have to collect animals in different shelters, and scoring according to the basic poker rules. It suits children well, because of the nice miniature animals, but basically it doesn't add much to a basic poker feel (at least you don't have to bet).

RATING: 5
1st play - played this with my 5 and 7 year old. To me the game was pretty random. My 5 year old was bored half way through and didn't finish. My 7 year old said it was "average" but considering that she rates everything else as "Great!", average is pretty bad.

On the plus side, the animals would go great in my Agricola box!

2nd play - played with the wife, the game is more tactical, a little like a worse version of lost cities. You can't plan anything and on any given turn the options are limited. Perhaps my kids will grow into this but I won't be sad if they don't.

RATING: 5
Kind of evolution of classic Battle Line.  Based on poker combinations, try to make the best with three cards adn two animal tokens on a field.  The main idea is that you are forced to play, and that can sometimes be bad for you.
Not my style.  Box is enormous for the contents, and boards are just thin cardboard.  Animal tokens are nice, but quite small.  Another Knizia re-implementation.

Some simple ideas that seem to make it too complex for kids to play with adults.  I tried this with two of my kids and it was impossible to keep it close without totally throwing the game.  Next time, I think I'll limit my hand size to 2 cards while their hand size is 3 cards.

RATING: 6
This was fun with two, would be fun with more, as well.  I think with 3 or 4, it would be harder to get the cards you need and more thought would go into placement to take the animals.  It reminded me of Hold Em crossed with Battleline stirred up by Amun-Re (set collection=pyramids).  You have to pay attention to having the most animals of a type and sets.  If you don't, you will lose as that can be big points.

This will hit the table again, for certain.

Good little family game.  The rule book could be a bit clearer.  The pieces (ie the animals) could have been produced just a little bit better.  The box didn't need to be so large for what's inside of it...

However, the game play was alright, my four year old didn't sit riveted like she does for some other games...but she did appear to be having fun.

Have to wait to see if she asks to play it again...but having only spent about $18, we'll have gotten our money's worth after a couple of games anyway...

Bottom line: Like poker for kids.  And I've spent my money on worse games then this...

RATING: 8
Rating is a combination of kids/adult game. With my kids it's a 9 or even a 10, they both enjoy it - with adults, probably a 6 (depends if you like poker type games), so overall an 8, as I like it.

Best described as a poker variant with cut down values and no suits (you can't get straights or flushes, just high, pair, two pair, triple, full house and 4 (and 5) of a kind).

Has an element of communal poker (like Texas Hold'em) in that the animals in the field count towards your hand (so a field with 2 sheep means you have a pair already, so play 3 more sheep and you have 5 of a kind).

Add the usual Kinza scoring mechanism (get points for being top, points for collecting a set) and you have a nice little filler. Not sure about the alternate bonus cards - seem a bit random.

Components are really nice - box is way oversized though, could be much smaller and still fit everything in easily.

RATING: 6.5
Es un Knizia de cartas, que a mí al menos, me ha recordado en su mecánica al battleline (en el aspecto de que aveces estas ogligado a poner cartas, aunque te venga mal). Hay tres granjas y sobre cada una dos animales. Junto con esos animales y tres cartas que juegue cada jugador, hay que conseguir una combinación tipo póker. El que gane, se lleva los animales y se reponen dos nuevos animales. Si al reponer, salen dos cartas seguidas que se refieren a animales ya no disponibles, la granja se cierra. El juego termina cuando se cierran las tres granjas. Tener la mayoría de un tipo de animal (hay caballos, vacas, cerdos, gallinas, ovejas y ovejas negras) tiene un bono de 6 puntos. Por tener un animal de cada, también hay bono. A esos puntos se suma la puntuación de los animales (oculta e impresa en la propia figura del animal). El que más puntos tiene, gana. Es un juego que tiene más profundidad de la que parece a simple vista. Entretenido.

RATING: 5
Seems like an incomplete design.  Card draws have big impact as the randomness of the draw can really determine whether someone does well or not.  I also want the black sheep to have positive impact along with their obviously negative impact. Give me a reason to want black sheep.  The decisions in this game are so limited and pretty straightforward.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
My wife likes this, but the components are really lousy with the very thin cards and super small animals with almost impossible-to-discern numerals printed under them. In addition, it's almost impossible to contest someone's control of a given field, so you just go round and round each claiming one through the luck of the draw, and playing your junky cards off on the others you'll never have a chance to win.

An excellent game. Better than Battleline, which it is similar to. Why is it better? One answer - Multi- player. This, plus the fact that it's VERY family friendly, plus the unknown point values makes it a keeper. AND the little animals are very cute!!!

UPDATE: The tasks make this game even better. A solid 7.5/10

The plastic animals are adorable.  Can't say the same about the game.  It is something like multi-player Schotten-totten except that there are only six different cards so it is likely that more than one player will get the highest hand for each of the targets.  In this case the first player to play that hand wins, which means the game is decided primarily by luck of the draw.  The cute bits make it an appealing kids' game, but it hasn't worked in my family: the kids find it too boring.

Uses Yahtzee / poker scoring with sets of cards to win fields of animals.  Each animal has a secret value (1-3 pts) for scoring at the end of the game. Bonus pts at end of game for most of each type of animal and complete sets of animals. Okay for playing with the kids; 1/2 hr playing time.

Kind of a strange game of making poker hands with farm animal cards.  There are 2 "community" animals in 3 different pens, and each player adds 3 cards to the pen to make the best 5 animal "hand".  Top hand wins the 2 animals in the pen which are worth points.

It's quick and simple enough where I still had a fair amount of fun, but it's not something I'd really seek to play.

Bought to play with my 4 year old son.  Will try it soon.

Played it on Friday 10/9/09 with Elijah when I got home early from work.  He was able to match cards up with the animals in the different fields, meaning he could make up sets pretty well to get a good hand.  He got bored halfway through and Heather had to take over.  She quite handily beat me with al of her bonus +6 cards.  We did not play with the tasks variant, although I feel this would add a lot more fun to thegame for adults.  I want to definitely make this a game Elijah and I play more often in the future, but it doesn;t seem really for him right now.  

For adults (or at least just Heather and I) I prefer Battleline.

For now this game is a 6.

Raised my rating to a 7 once I realized I initially played some of the rules incorrectly. Now the game is even more strategic and definitely on par with other "poker" style games like "Battle Line". Plays best with 4 since it is more difficult to dominate the game with bonus points.
 
The little plastic figures makes this even more accessible to children who just love the ability of winning these critters with the right cards. The kids' eyesights are also a tremendous asset when it comes to reading the minute figures on the animals' tummies at the end of the game..

Good family game with a set-collection mechanism to create Yahtzee hands with cards of farm animals.  2 animals are placed on each of 3 tiles in the center and each player adds 3 animal cards to make their own "hand" to try to win those animals in the center.  Cute farm animals (though the point values on the bottom of some are a bit hard to read) to capture the interest of kids with enough going on in the game to keep adults interested.  The tiles are pretty thin, though, and the box is about twice as large as it needs to be.  Overall, a fun game that we all enjoyed.
Played with advanced/"task" rules tonight -- quite fun, created more competition for specific sets.

Even though this is rated lower, this game holds a special place in my heart.  It was the last game I played with my father before he passed away.

It's a "bidding" game for the three fields in play.  Each field has two animals on it that can help with your scoring at the end of the game.  You "bid" with animal cards; three of a kind is the best, high card is the worst; horse is the best, black sheep is the worst.

Good game to play with the girl. We skip all the objective cards & just try to make hands with the 3 in our hands & the 2 on each card, taking turns playing one or two cards upside down to a maximum of 3 upside down at each pen. Very easy to tank a little & keep it interesting for her. Not at all how it was *meant* to be a competitive, interesting game, but it works for me & my girl.

A great game not just for kids, but for adults looking for a lighter game that's kind of like a cross between Battle Line and Balloon Cup - for 4 players.  A lot of the decisions end up being obvious ones, but with the advanced rules and extra goals, I would probably bump my rating up at least a half point.  A neat Fantasy Flight title I had heard nothing about.

UPDATE: I've bumped it down from a 7. It would be a great game except that luck is dominant, and you can get completely shut out of a game even when playing decently.

The components are cute, but it's not one of Knizia's better games. It just has too much luck, and 3+ player games are very chaotic. In a way, the game reminds me of Chinese poker in the way that you form multiple "hands," although there is a little more skill than in Chinese poker.

2-player Black Sheep is playable and involves some strategy, but I wouldn't play it with more, and even the 2-player version doesn't call me.

We enjoyed playing Black Sheep with 2 players. The rules are fairly simple. The game flows quickly and has a nice balance of luck and skill. It doesn't seem to provoke my husband to take long, long turns as some other games do. I rate the gameplay as a 7.

The components in the Fantasy Flight Games edition are cute, but they are too small and some (the "corral" and the "fields") are downright flimsy. If we played this game more often or played with younger children, we would want to mount these items on heavier cardstock. The tiny plastic animals beg to be painted, not just for aesthetic reasons but to make them easier for our middle-aged eyes to distinguish from across the table. The half-size cards are annoyingly hard to shuffle. I rate the components in this edition as a 5.

Hace tiempo que Knizia esta en dique seco. Esto lo soluciona mediante el reciclaje de sus propios juegos. Este no es mas que un battle line adaptado a 4 jugadores. La caja es gigante con respecto a su contenido y la producción es lamentable, por el uso de cartulinas e vez de cartón. Aun así se salva de la quema, pues hereda todo lo bueno de un buen juego.

I'm not sure why, but I love playing this game with my boys. It's got a little bit of strategy - which they can handle and just a bit of luck (in which animals you get) so I'm okay with that. And who wouldn't like tiny little animals that are done well.

This is a cute game of forming poker hands with animals, with three of your cards and two plastic animals. The plastic animals are shared between the players. Three potential sets are being played at a time. Win a set and get the plastic animals which have variable scores. Avoid the black sheep since they give negative scores. There are bonuses at the end for the most of a type of animal.

Knizia’s take on Texas Hold’em Poker. Instead of one there are three pots, the pots (two animals) themselves constitute the community cards. Bids are replaced by playing cards openly to one of the pots where they combine with the animals to form the most valuable ‘hand’. In the end, each animal is worth VP’s and additional VP’s are awarded for majorities of animals or certain combinations. Ok although a bit too long for what is on offer.

RATING: 8
The game surely doesn't deserve this rating, but I'm rating a mixture of my feelings and my kids'.  My kids absolutely love the game, though after a few plays I conclude that the game is completely luck based.  

It's essentially a light version of Battle Line, with a little bit of poker mixed in (with the common cards in the middle).  There's too much of a possibility of just holding out for the right cards, which usually eventually come along.

That said, it's an ultra light kid/family game, so for what it is, it really works. My kids continually ask to play it, so that makes me like the game.

The physical production is pretty poor - the animals are too small and the cows and horses look too much alike.  Also, the amount of empty space in the box is a travesty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Its a simplified poker game with Knizia's typical bidding twist, but I'm not sure I'd classify it for kids. The theme is certainly kiddish, but the calculations/suits/secret-mission-rules make it complex in a different way.

I'd probably be okay playing it as a filler with players who know the game, but I'm not sure its worth the time teaching all the extra rules to new players.

You think you'll like this because it was made by the same guy who made [thing=42][/thing]? You will be disappointed. The big selling point of this game is the plastic animals. In actual gameplay, you use the animals along with cards to make ... *drumroll* ... [i]poker hands[/i] to try to "win" the right combinations of animals. Oooh, poker hands. Haven't been exposed to [i]them[/i] before. :shake: Try [thing=5782][/thing] instead. It's got cards with animals and Kniziaesque scoring too, but there's more tension and it's more original.

First and foremost, this is a quick family game.  We play this exclusively when youngsters (below 12-13) want in.  It's a light, poker like card game themed around farm animals (kid friendly).  The scoring is quite random (kid friendly) and the rules are as simple as can be (kid friendly).  Did I mention this was a kids game? =)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Nice cool little animal figurines for a light game.  I enjoyed the first half way more than the last half.  I especially did not like how the endgame works.  There can be bottleneck issues where a player deliberate does not play on one particular field filled by other players' cards.  This unresolved field forces other players to place cards in other fields.  Now, as a strategy, this is fine but in implementation with rules as is, IMO it does not work very well at all.  I would volunteer a variant where any player can commit one, two or even three cards to any field that is not closed to them.  The rule of only allowing players to place one or two within two turns on each field is limiting and cause chaos and randomness that is not common with a Reiner Knizia design.

Fun game, and quick. For any number of players. All of the variants work well, too.

Problems...

The tiny numbers on the little animals are difficult to see; these require a sharpy to bring out.

Cows or Horses? You decide! These are difficult to tell apart. I colored the cow horns silver.

The cards are tiny, but not so bad, and sturdy.

Crappy game mats - too shiny to take laminate well, darn.

Too large box! Sheesh, this is the worst offense of all. It really made me shocked to find out how tiny the itty bitty animals are.

Looks like an interesting idea.

This is an ok game better with more. Only played 2players and only used the goal cards once. Prefer without. The person who wins all black sheep won is too lucky.

Bought this one on clearance at Target to play with my daughter.  It is a light strategy game with an absurdly high luck factor.  I suppose that is exactly the point since it is meant to be a family game and the child should have at least some chance of winning.

I could see [i]Black Sheep[/i] being used as a lead-in to some light/medium hand management games (such as [i]Battle Line[/i], for example).

Edit - After a few more plays I grudgingly raised my rating to a 6.5.  It really does help very young children with decision making and assists them in understanding that sometimes you can't have it all.  You need to prioritize and cut your losses on some animals in order to win others.

At first this seems to be a really cute game with really sweet animals to collect. The way you try to win the animals with poker hands (2 pair, 3 of a king, etc.) seems fun too. But...the game doesn't really allow too much strategy. It is so luck based as to what animal cards you draw from the pile. Now, I do believe it is probably best played with more than 2 players. Since this is all we have tried so far, it has left us with a kind of bad taste in our mouth. It's ok with 2 players, but the luck factor is really the whole game and that sometimes ruins the game.

I never mind an element or even a heavy element of luck in games. Sometimes I prefer the chaos that comes from luck. But in this game, where you go in thinking...Awww!..."look at all those cute little animals" and you have your player board pens ready to collect them. And then you draw nothing to allow you to win even the smallest offer of animals with a 2 pair. It can be annoying. 

For example, if you play with the mission cards (i.e. maybe the black sheep collector card). You may think ok, I will try to collect all of the black sheep. But the thing is, you have no control over winning the black sheep and you will probably get burned on this card because the black sheep are negative points individually. 

I still like the game and hope to really give it a try with more players.

I have only played the basic version without the "mission" cards. Gameplay works with kids but game can last too long to keep their attention (plus they don't yet know poker hands). This probably could have been a neat gamer's game from Knizia without the random points, but instead it's just a really simple, but functional, time passer.

(5+ plays)  The kids really like it, and it teaches poker hands early.  It took me until my early 20s to have poker hands down for some reason - so it's worth it for that.  I get a bit bored with it, and would prefer Balloon Cup, but this one supports 3 or 4 players.

I don't know why we haven't played more of this game,

We painted some of the animals which was fun :)

This game was cool, I think maybe some of the points were too random and sometimes that can punish you for doing well,

like the other players happen to get some animals with high points and you stomp them but get only low point ones, and then your black sheeps are bigger negatives then theirs, not often though.

Id say 1 out of every 3 games the winner is kinda not really the winner, you know?

Im not selling it though- this is a nice mix between simple 5 card poker and a board game.

Knizia's version of [i]Texas Hold'Em[/i] aimed to kids, but with a lot more decisions to make, since there is three spots where to play cards and there are some game end bonus to fight for. These changes make the luck factor to be lower, even when it is obvious that it is still there. Speaking of other things, I like the fact that there is a continuous line in the gameplay, not just a bunch of independent hands. For all these reasons I'm sure that this game may appeal not only to kids, but to [i]Poker[/i] fans and to gamers in general. For me, games like [i]Havoc: The Hundred Years War[/i], this one and even [i]Battle Line[/i], turn the horrible [i]Poker[/i] into a great experience, not just based in luck and bluffing, but with some decisions to make in order to improve your chances.

A játék kivitelezésében érdekes kontrasztot véltem felfedezni. A kis állatfigurák aranyosak, szépen kidolgozottak és akkor itt vége is az összes pozitívumnak. Ezek után érthetetlen számomra, hogy a játéktáblákat miért kelllett ilyen vékony papírra nyomtatni, a kártyák miért ilyen kicsik és fényesek. A játék maga egész jó, nagyban hasonlít a Chicago pókerhez. Itt viszont sokkal könnyebben kijönnek nagyobb sorozatok, ezért a kisebb kombinációkra értelmetlen számítani. Lehet csak a csapat volt túl jó és ezért csak úgy repkedtek a magas kombinációk, majd a további játékok megmutatják. A feladat kártyák nagyon nem változtatnak a stratégián, legalábbis elsőre nem így történt.

OK filler for gamers, but more appropriate for families, especially kids 1st grade+.

The good: Inexpensive game with a theme and components that can appeal to the whole family. Cute animals and artwork. Fairly fun to play. Several ways to score help make it interesting.

The bad: The animals are hard to tell apart, the cardboard pieces are very flimsy, and the cards are tiny (although to be fair, you can't really expect much more in the components for this price). There's a lot of waiting for a good card, and the game always seems to last too long for its depth.

Overall, it's a good value as long as your expectations aren't too high.

A bit like poker, except you win animals instead of money. And animals have hidden points under them, so it's heavy on randomness.

Super game for the 8-10's and enough of a game to keep the parents amused as well. Good intro game for kids struggling to get into the hobby - think the theme helps a lot. Subtly clever artwork as well.

A good game for families with young kids. They like the animal pieces to collect, the cute artwork, and the simple game play.

Excellent FF customer service speedily replaced a missing animal piece. Got to play a game, really a simplified version of Hold 'Em poker. A couple things separate this from poker, but not far off in a family card game.

►PUBLIC(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
☺ Jeu tactique (plus d’éléments aléatoires et/ou de hasard raisonné).
☺ Jeu familial (pour jeunes et/ou adultes). 
☻ Jeu pour jeunes (je crains que son principal intérêt pour des joueurs adultes soit d’y jouer pour leur faire plaisir). 

►JOUEURS, NOMBRE(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
# Nombres non-déterminés.

►COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
- THÈME : quasi-abstrait; peu ressenti.
+ Aide de jeu : 1 par joueur. Bien détaillé.
+ Icônes : sont faciles à comprendre ou à mémoriser.
- Matériel : non-optimal; cheval vs vache ne se distinguent pas rapidement l’un de l’autre.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
Jeu de cartes dérivé du Poker / "Texas hold’em". La disposition consiste en 4 prés, communs à tous, comportant 2 animaux. Un joueur peut gagner la paire d’animaux d’un pré à condition de jouer 3 cartes « Animal » de sa main correspondantes aux 2 animaux du pré, formant ainsi une main d’animaux (habituellement un carré ou un full).

2e essai à 4 joueurs (variante « Tâches secrètes »). Il n’y a pas à dire, j'ai détesté cette 2e partie encore plus que ma 1e et je sens que la tendance va se maintenir. Le jeu est trop dépendant de la pioche pour tenter de compétitionner un autre joueur ayant déjà débuté en force sur un pré. De plus, j’ai été complètement décalée durant toute la partie (ex: je piochais des cartes de chevaux quand le besoin était aux coqs et vice-versa). J'ai fini la partie à 0 point (sans aucun animal) et un autre joueur a terminé à -3 points à cause de ses moutons noirs. En parlant des moutons noirs, tout le monde à part moi en avait au moins 1 mais c'est moi qui avais l'objectif secret du "monopole des moutons noirs" pour gagner...

Παιχνίδι για 2-3-4 παίχτες.
Απλό με μικρή στρατιγική και λίγες γνώσεις από poker.
Φτιάξε τον στάβλο με τα περισότερα ζώα και γίνε εσύ ο καλύτερος βοσκός.
Περιέχει κάρτες αποστολών που το κάνουν πιό ενδιαφέρων.

I dont' get all this hatred against this game. It's simple but fun and you also have some rather interesting decisions to take if you really want to win.
I think it could be nice also with kids but it is NOT a kids game

Mild-mannered poker variant for kids who can't wait to be addicted to the real thing.

Update:

One of the most draw-dependent games that I've ever played. Ok for kids, I guess.  Depends on your definition of "child abuse".

Run away leader is a problem with this.
Even though this is basically poker, being forced to play card in certain areas with respect to how many cards are on your side, reduces the enjoyment.
If there is actual frustration because you have to play a card somewhere and it happens a lot, is that fun... no.

A game for pre-teens/younger children that has great components. A set collection game  with poker like gameplay and random points generated at the end. A fun way to get young ones into strategic thinking.

This sat on the shelf too long! We got it on sale at Target and really think we bought it more for the Meeples than anything. The game however is really fun and has scoring similar to poker. You play three cards on a pasture containing 2 animal Meeples, you can play one card or 2 but if you have played 1 or 2 on a previous turn, you must play enough cards to complete the 3 cards on the pasture. This combined with a 3 card hand limit creates a nice strategy while trying to win the good animals vs winning Black sheep that negatively impact your score.

I like the components, but i prefer Chicago poker instead of playing black sheep. As an exception i like very much the secret objective to collect every black sheep and simply win the game.

Texas hold em poker with farm animals. That's it. Not bad though. Essentially, the meta becomes, 1 farm you are investing in, 1 farm you are half-assing, and one farm you are getting rid of cards to.

Nice and quick game, a little 'mini poker' where players gather as much animals as they can in their own coral. Points at the bottom of the animals as well as sets and majority score points in the end. Enjoyable for all ages.

Обычный еврогейм, семейный и простой. Покерными комбинациями с рисунками животных боремся за фигурки этих самых животных. Кладём по 1-2 карты до 3 к каждой из 4-х сторон поля, считаем комбинацию вместе с животными на картах и в виде фигурок. У кого покерная комбинация выше, забирает фигурок. На фигурках очки (на пузике) - у кого больше, тот выиграл. 

Добавка от FFG с заданиями "а ля Ticket to Ride" выводит игру на чуть более высокий уровень, нежели тот, на котором она бы была со своими +6 очков за большинство животных.

This game (as all games in this series) requires a lot of die rolling. Roll a six, get a hit. For each hit, roll again to see if any damage was done. Also, while the components are high quality, Avalanche Press seems to charge more than the "going rate" for what you get.

RATING: 7
GWAS is a wonderful system for playing Naval Wargames anywhere from the pre-dreadnought era to Washington Treaty-What-ifs.



Watch out for the minor print errors on the hit box records! A visit to the Web-Grognards Web site will sort you out on those. Use as many of the optional rules as you like. It's a super system, well made and addictive and you'll want to buy more.

For a devoted naval gamer, GWAS: Mediterranean is pure joy.  The map and individual ship counters are exceptionally attractive.  The historical research -- both into the capabilities of the ships themselves, and into the often obscure historical actions that provide the basis for the scenarios -- is impeccable and impressive.  The rules are well-organized and cleanly laid out, and soon become almost second-nature.  With the  77 scenarios provided, you could keep playing this game for years.  The 10 battle scenarios give you a good game that will last for an hour or so, while the operational scenarios can make for a long day of intense gaming.  And for those of us who grew up on AH's "Jutland," it's marvelous fun getting to play Greeks versus Turks, or Austrians versus French and/or Italians, or Germans & Turks versus the Russian Black Sea fleet -- or unleashing the "Goeben" against French and British squadrons in the first weeks of the Great War. My only complaint about it is that playing the actual naval engagements on a small map feels cramped and artificial.

RATING: 4
Updated rating from 2011.  Set it up again, and having another flash of disillusionment on the true SUCKDOM of the BS combat system.


Research and throw-weight value of package -- 10; components 8; scenarios 8.  Tactical system 1.

A wonderful idea that goes horribly awry on the tactical map.  You will make hundreds, and hundreds and hundreds of die rolls if you ever get a full fleet vs full fleet action.  An exhausting exercise in bookkeeping and frustration.  I spent 3 hours rolling dice continually for 3 tac rounds of French/Ital vs Aus fleet combat.  What a waste of great idea, op scenarios, and components on a MIND NUMBING combat system.  A huge shame.

Consider -- main fleet action of 6-10 BBs or Bs, some CLs, and 6-10 DDs or torpedo boats; you are rolling around 10 dice per big boy for primary and secondary guns, and checking for hits; then rolling for hit effects; then marking these hits off board on sheets;  maybe 90 shot rolls, and 15-20 hit rolls, per side.  Then, next gun/torpedo segment (there are 5 per round), you do it all again, but have to check for reduced values (dice #) due to hits first time around; for every ship, each time it fires, for 5 segments.  So, 100 dice rolls, and 10-15 damage to guns counts, per side, per segment.  And this is supposed to be fun?  

This game is CRYING for an alternate, "bullet summary" combat resolution system that applies hits at least 5 times faster.  What a shame.

Solid low to medium complexity system in the tradition of Avalon Hill's classic Bismarck and Jutland games. More detailed combat resolution systems are available on the web for those who want more detail. AVP did not go over the top with the counters on this series. The rules are well-written and the rulebook well-written and organized. The game system well developed, in my opinion anyway. Similar systems are out there, but this one seems bug free, is aesthetically attractive and well supported by this manufacturer.

The rules have huge gaps and seem to assume you already know how to play the game. The traditional naval game approach of writing out and tracking orders feels cumbersome these days. Combat results are highly luck dependent as is the chance if intercepting an enemy fleet. All of these problems probably make it a great <i>simulation</i>, but I didn't have any fun playing this <i>game</i>.

Naval warfare in the Mediterranean in WWI. Very nice maps with detailed counters representing ships that took or might have taken action in that era. All nations that had a navy in this area are represented. The rules are easy and fighting action, although it has simple steps, give accurate results. It has a load of scenarios with a variety of missions and operations enough to keep one interested in this wargame for a lifetime. Most are historical; some are hypothetical. They include biplanes taking off carriers, airships, torpedoes, mines, leaders, shore bombardment, oilers and subs.

RATING: 7
There are some interesting mechanics here. I like the overall simple approach. I don't mind the dice-fest combat resolution as much as some- it is still reasonably fun. The counters and maps are top notch. The rules could be better (I mean the editing, examples, omissions, etc.) , but they are still not a major problem. I am mildly interested in this series now, and I expect to play more of this game in the future.

I wanted to like this, I really did - witness how many games in the series I inexplicably bought.  But every time I played it, it was just no fun.  Between far too many scenarios that just don't work and a tactical system that isn't very good, you're left with just the operational stuff.  But the operational part just never really held my interest on its own, so the game as a whole just didn't work for me.

RATING: 6
I have played twice.  The first look was a simple battle scenario, using Dreadnought battle rules.  The second look used an operational scenario on the regional map, which concluded after we fought one tactical battle/

Playing with my friend is entertaining, and I am up for more.  However, I don't feel confident I could teach this game.  The rules we used included the Dreadnought tactical battle rules, which I do not own.  My teacher dismissed both the basic and advanced rules in the game box as unacceptable.

The operational rules left me gasping for full comprehension.  My teacher did a great job filling in the blanks and getting me indoctrinated.  In the scenario we played, he had to write out the entire set of planned moves for all 84 turns!  This is not a trivial commitment.

The pace of the operational game is okay - roll for weather, mark off your fuel consumption and see if you end up in the hex where your enemy is.  Depending on the scenario, you may not want to be found - so there is a cat and mouse element to the game.

But eventually, it is likely the enemy combatants, or some sub-set of them, will encounter each other.  Then you swap over to the tactical battle map, and lots of dice are rolled.

The battle action is fun, and fairly intuitive.  Seeing how the various boats and ships square off against each other is interesting.  

While discussing the game, I realized my friend really enjoyed the context around why the battles happened, which helped him see the meaning of the operational portion of the game.  So in a sense, part of the enjoyment of the game was already received, just in prepping for our game session.

I like this game, but may not want to be the game leader for a while.

Lives as part of the dedicated wargame collection.

Who wouldn't like this?  Old French battleships, the Austrian Navy, Italians, Greeks, Turks and Russions (for Pete's Sakes even Bulgarians!!).  The tougher thing is to get them into a position to fight.  The difficulty of any naval game is that, if you fight the way the actual leaders did, it was hard to get into a fight and the cost of the ships were such that an admiral who permitted himself to get into an "even" fight was generally cashiered.  So very few cases of a straight up fight can be developed that are based on history.  Luckily history is not a constraint and any number of player developed scenarios can be put together to feed the intellect.

2nd edition.

This is the second major series I've collected, after ASL. I like naval games from fighting sail to the Fleets, but the allure of this particular period has always been irresistable to me. It starts with the lines of the ships--the turrets and casements, the tall funnels, the concave cuts of the bow, the acute angle of the stern. The very name, dreadnought, conjures up images of grey, foreboding ships of war slipping their moorings and training their guns across the open sea. The Great White Fleet, the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet . . . add in zeppelins, biplanes, and submarines and you have something not far from Jules Verne, an illusion all the more compelling because many of the scenarios presented in the series are alternative history hypotheticals--we see our world through a glass darkly, a warped and shimmering reflection of what might have been. A Spanish-Japanese clash in the Philippines in 1898, for example. Brien Miller's artwork, on the boxes as well as the celebrated counters, captures the mood perfectly for me.

Still, despite my affection for the period, I resisted GWAS for a long time, mainly by telling myself my real interest was in tactical systems (not GWAS's strongpoint). This, of course, is terrible reasoning, especially since Karl Laskas' advanced tactical rules are now available for both the pre-dreadnought and the dreadnought eras. Naval combat in this period is more subtle than many understand; it's not just a cut and dried calculus of guns and armor: battle smoke, the angle of the sun, range effects (what I call the sweet spot), concentration of fire, ammunition types, and command and control all play their part and are modelled to greater or lesser extents in the various tactical systems out there. There's a lot to learn and explore at this level. Still, there comes a point where without the operational dimension the action starts to feel two-dimensional. This is where GWAS has made its mark, and a cursory glance at the materials I have in hand suggests that these boxes will well repay my investment.

Fascinating historical survey of the state-of-affairs at the time. I love the way scenarios also cover the Balkan Wars and some what-ifs. Beautiful components - I put my counters in number order in a Chessex tray together with the zeps relevent to the time and place from the APL supp. A big, chunky universe of possibilties in a box and a fine example of what APL do so well. Sadly I only play solo, so if you live in London and want to give this a whirl, just drop me a line.

Beautiful game system that is fun to play.  Why worry about the penetration values and angles of declination with silly algebraic formulas?  This game has it all built in for you.  With a simple roll of the dice all your calculations result in either a hit or a miss.  Simplify your WWI gaming experiences and keep the miniatures in their cases (and don't worry about busting your back carry around weighted cases of lead/pewter figures and gages).  Wonderful series that can bring you back to naval gaming for the original reason why you liked to play: because it was fun!  The Austro-Hungarian fleet rocks.  ;-)

My favourite of the GWAS series so far, the Med is so narrow in places that the cat and mouse aspect of the operational scenarios are at times nail biting.

Despite the slightly damp squib nature of the tactical game I still think it is more than adequate as a reasonable simulation, it's rare that we use the tactical map unless for some of the larger key battles.

The mix of nations is great and the pieces are lovely to look at. The map to is great, I think the 'brick' spacing gives a nice break from hexes.

As for the rules they are weak in places and I wish there was a 'war at sea' community as with APs panzer grenadier games but once both players get to grips with significant prepanning the rules can be bypassed for the excellent player aids available online.

To avoid endless photocopying for ship/log records I use plastic wallets and perspex with fine dry wipe pens. Quick and easy to keep up to date information for each ship/fleet giving each player a portfolio of their allied or Central power ships.

The real issue is finding any avalanche press games in the uk at reasonable prices. But if you are just after one Gwas game I'd recommend this over Jutland. Not by much but the Med offers slightly more eclectic/balanced forces for both players.

Stoke the boilers, prepare the guns and try to ignore the constant order changes from that damned amateur in the admiralty, it's time to chase the Goeben and clear the dastardly Hun from the middle Sea! Grab your cap and charts you've got your work cut out for you Admiral.

RATING: 9
A rating of 9 (using Dreadnought rules), we have tried the 9 Battle scenarios and many of the Operational Scenarios. (Optional smoke may be excessive in the first, small ship scenario.) As written the Tactical rules produced boring movement and predictable damage results based on the probabilities of 2d6. Except in cases of overwhelming firepower asymmetry (boring) the winner is pretty much random (Rating = 4). It's much more exciting (if no less random in outcome) to roll for initiative at EVERY movement step (Rating = 5). These tactical-based ratings would be even lower if not for the beautiful counters and essentially historic outcomes. The Operational game appears to have enough merit to made this game, as written, rate a 6 or 7 (ie  2 over the tactical). Using the Dreadnought rules, all the Battle scenarios seem unbalanced against the Allies.

Note: Have played many Operational scenarios. A lot of good thought/gaming can be had. Balance is better but many of the Victory Conditions are weak. Rules gaps are pervasive and house rules abound. Overall, a lot of fun in this 'kit'.

Note: Switching to simultaneous combat with Initiative used only for (smoothed) movement. Combat is so 'fickle' that good tactics can be overtaken by 'extreme' dice so just enjoy the experience.

Note: Later GWAS/SWWAS games have increased the fuel points/fuel box to a historically more accurate 24.

Zeppelins adds more airships.

This series is like some girlfriends: you love them but you must take the whole package. Conceptually the game is quite cool, with a nice operational phase and a simplified but functional tactical resolution when enemy fleets meet. Easy to love, as I said, and with tons of scenarios and nationalities.

The dire thing are the rule books. You can, literally, close your eyes, point a finger on a random page, and find an unclear/contradictory rule. Various Q&As and FAQs are almost useless. What amazes me the most is how you only need to, let's say, follow the setup procedures as written to find an hole in five minutes. And no one did ever catch it??

So, I put GWAS Mediterranean among the games I'm a fan of, but lowered my mark by one point: as long as you patch the rules the best you can, and move on, it will give you a lot of fun.

Have only got the 1st edition & have only played 1 scenario so bear that in mind. It was okay - I'm very much into naval games but everything chugging around at one hex per turn & occaisionally blundering into each other didn't really do it for me. Also a few problems with the rules, caused in part by a desire for brevity which perhaps went a little too far - the port combat rules are a disgrace for instance. Unlike others I didn't have a huge problem with the tactical board although again, a little more detail might have avoided some problem areas. Physical quality very good - nice ship counters.

Naval combat in the Dreadnought Era; from WWI to the 1930s. Adds elements of eleven navies to the GWAS system, including those of Italy, Austria, France, Britain,Turkey, and others. Combines a strategic game where players move their fleets around a theater, with a tactical game when vessels make contact. Easy to learn rules and fun to play: similar to naval miniatures but with much simplified combat and maneuvering systems. Great looking, plan view graphics of the ships, on double size counters for most vessels. If you're into Harpoon or COA's Admiralty series, these games may not give you the detail you desire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My first GWAs game, and I did not play it a lot until I got GWAS:Jutland. I also prefer playing with the Dreadnought tactical rules - mostly because they put more premium on tactical manoevre, which the basic/advanced rules do not. Spotting rolls and damage control is fun as well. I think combat RESULTS mirror historical descriptions very well while it is still possible to realistically play out very large engagements. But then, I have not played any of those "trajectory-tracking" kinds of miniatures games and cannot compare.
Battles are a lot bloodier than in reality, but I guess this comes with most all naval wargames... 

First and foremost, this is an Operational level game, and works best when played as such. The "seaching for your opponent's fleet with how many ships" actually is much more important in determining who controls the sea than the muzzle velocity of the German 11" guns compared to the british 15"... and the games series captures that very well. 

Lots of good scenarios  - both historcal re-creations and plausible and well-researched what-ifs. ALL of the scenarios are excellent for play balance, which is a great achievement. 

Why not a better ranking ? The campaign game. There is no campaign game and I would really, really like some means to mirror how my skillful out-manoevering of the enemy impacts on the strategic situation. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Operational scenarios show the amount of preplanning which went into naval operations in this period, and the slow response to changing situations.  In most cases, it takes 8 hours to react to information received, which explains why so many naval interception missions during WWI failed.  The tactical game leaves me a bit cold--lumping ships together in groups of 8 to a large hex rather than forming lines, columns, etc., seems a bit too removed from reality.

A very good system. Operational level is very well done, tactical one is much criticable. Naval campaigns in the mediterranean area are the best ones.

An under-rated game.  Sure, the tactical combat is not as nuts-and-bolts as some other track-per-shell games, but it serves the campaign well.  This is a strategic game first and foremost, simulating the first World War in the Med.  The flight of the Goeben, Austria-Hungary's fleet of pre-dreadnoughts, use of zeppelins - all present and used in the game.  It uses a lot of die rolls, but who DOESN'T have a bucket of die and claims to be a boardgame geek?  The tactical combat results are simplified, but end up with results that mirror history.  The campaign engine is genius, and always fun to play.  And the art on the counters and maps is really in a league of its own.  Less than happy about the factors on both sides of the counters instead of the 'silhouette-only' counter backs later products use making tactical intel possible.  EAGERLY looking forward to a reprint of this that fixes that...I suspect that reprint will kick this title up into my top few choices.

It's a godd idea to have plan the moves in advance, but there is some problem in managing battles and their results.

Oh, I loved this idea. Especially that time period. However, it felt like a less exciting version of Flight of the Goeben, and that was 25 years older! The counters and maps are great, the system less so. Seems like an Avalanche Press trademark...

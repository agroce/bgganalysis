A fun dexterity game.  Fans of Hamsterolle in particular will like this.  It requires a bit more setting up and explaining than that game - but not a lot.  Is it better?  I think it depends on your mood.  Aesthetically, this is great though - a swinging ship which is placed inside a box and pivots on a large ball bearing.  A good one for Christmas and when the right people come over and a few wines are had.

+ Incredibly attractive components; Because of the well-designed boat gimble, the balancing act creates a high level of tension
- Whenever one thing falls off, typically EVERYTHING falls off which makes it very difficult for that player to compete for the rest of the game.

This is a surprisingly good, light dexterity game. My rating of it is marred just a little bit, however, by the limitations of the component quality. Specifically the cardboard panels that you mount on the game insert itself do not sit very well and mar the experience a bit. Otherwise this is a very clever little design.

Saw this game at a demo at my FLGS and had to have it.  Loved the components and it was like nothing I'd seen.  However, after a couple plays it just kinda goes flat.  Sure, it's fun to drag out with someone who's never played and seeing them get all tense when they have to place something (personally, I love watching my girlfriend's mom, she gets WAY into it).  But, there's a good deal of downtime.  To be honest, the last game we played, I just watched and it was as enjoyable as playing.  Which, I'm not sure is a good thing.

Of all the dexterity games that I've played... this is one of the best. Not only are the components to a high standard, aesthetically pleasing, and manages to look less like a toy and more of a game... but the whole dexterity-mechanic is ingenious; By adding pieces to the ship, you are changing the center of gravity, which means the ship WILL become unbalanced. Thus, the game isn't only about getting pieces onto the ship safely... you also want to "set up" your opponents so that it's unlikely they will get pieces on. 

I can't imagine any game replacing this in my collection.

One of the best dexterity games I've ever seen.  The appearance of this game alone makes it one of the best.  And, the option to play cards and catch falling pieces provides even more options for players in what could otherwise be "just a dexterity game."  It is, in fact, a dexterity game which does limit it a bit, but I was impressed.

This is a VERY tense game and very enjoyable. If you've got poor reflexes, drink a lot of coffee, or aren't familiar with basic physics and gravity? 
You likely won't like this. Very well designed and gorgeous components too. 
Just wish the cardboard for the cone the boat rests on had been laminated as after only a few plays and set ups, it's fraying on edges.

A simple yet not easy at all dexterity game, Riff Raff really tests your steady hand and estimation skills: actually, since placing items on the rocking ship can be sometimes challenging for a grown-up, let alone a kid, Riff Raff never manages to get boring.

It’s undoubtedly one of the best dexterity games I’ve ever played.

Riff Raff is a game I've been looking to get ahold of for some time. I'm getting into a pretty big love affair with dexterity games in general, especially quirky ones. So far this takes the cake for quirkiness. The components are fantastic and really draw a crowd. Game play is vaguely similar to a grown up version of Capitan Wacklepuding. Overall a good playing dexterity game with over the top components. Seriously if you've never seen this game setup, then go look!

Riff Raff is another fun entry in the "stack some pieces without stuff falling" vein of dexterity games.

The trick here is that you're trying to place stuff on a ship with multiple points of articulation.  As you put stuff on the ship, the ship rocks around to rebalance itself.

Every round, each player plays a numbered card.  The ship also has numbers on it, and you must place your piece on the area of the ship corresponding to your card.  Whoever played the highest card get to go first, but the high numbers correspond to tricky placements high up on the mast of the ship, whereas the low numbers are on the deck of the ship which is much more stable.

If anything falls off the ship, you have to take the pieces unless you were able to catch them with your hands before they hit the table!  First player that rids themselves of pieces wins.

Overall, a cool twist in the stacking dexterity genre, but might not be necessary if you already own other games in this vein.

This might be my new go-to stacking game.

First off, this obviously the game has the all-important aesthetics factor down. This game is just cool to look at, and in this genre that's pretty much a must.

Usually I find stacking games make some concessions in the gameplay department: the stacking itself is always fun, but the mechanics are almost always lacking in some way. In Animal Upon Animal, it's the reliance on the die and a general lack of depth and variety. In Bausack, it's the length of the game and the fact that playing to win feels at odds with trying to make a cool, tall tower. In Villa Paletti, it's an overwrought scoring system. Riff Raff deftly avoid this trap, and the gameplay feels simultaneously more substantial and tight than other games in the genre.

These games all still have their place in my collection (and... my heart), but next time I encounter someone who's never played a stacking game before besides Jenga, this is probably the one I'm going to pull out.

The only possible flaw compared to other games, you don't get as much variety in terms of how your ship looks. You're not going to get the variety of a cool Bausack tower here. This might hurt its longevity somewhat, but honestly given how fun it is, I sort of doubt it.

RATING: 8
Fun game.

Make sue you put a metal washer in between the metal ball and the wooden pole for a more stable ship. The default weight of just the metal ball is too light and even a small nudge will make it swing uncontrollably. Try different size washers. The heavier the more stable it will be.

Not for Trade. My wife always demands that I bring out a party game that is fun for just 4 players. I personally own over 50 party games, but the vast majority requires 6 or more players to really make it fun. It is quite difficult to find a game that fits "Party" category for just 4 players, usually because of how these games typically score. Fortunately, games like Loopin' Louie break the mold and create lots of laughter among adults. 

I will submit that Riff Raff is just as hilarious as players try to lunge for the falling pieces before they hit the table. This game is incredibly difficult to find in the states but I had a good friend in Germany who personally transported this game to me. I'm a lucky guy!

Players are trying to stow cargo onto a pitching sailing ship.  Another totally insane dexterity game from Zoch.  Players are given a set of cards, numbered from 1 to 10.  Each turn they select one to play, reveal simultaneously, and play in descending order of card played.  Players must load a piece of their cargo onto the section of the ship matching their card number.  Cards 1 to 4 are in the relatively safe deck area, but 5 to 10 are on the yardarms, attached to the mast.  The ship rocks various directions, according to how the weigh is distributed - balanced by a metal ball hidden below the game board.  Cargo can, and will, fall off the ship.  Players can catch the cargo as it slides off, which is tossed into the box.  Any cargo that is missed goes back into the player's stash.  Most loaded cargo after ten turns wins.  Ingenious, and very tough.

As always with good "dexterity games", the most appealing, great looking aspect is only one part of the fun. Since you play cards simultaneously to determine where to place your things and you have to play all cards from 1 - 10, this offers fun decisions. Mostly you can foresee, when things will fall off, but not how, so try to prepare to catch them.

See my pictorial introduction for more.

Interested in this :) 

Woohoo managed to get a copy in an auction

well this certainly did not disappoint.
I love love love it.

Its really good fun as you try to position pieces lightly on the ship without causing it to rock violently and throw off its other pieces.
The weighty ball on the end to balance the ship is unpredictable and this is the genius of the design as you cannot predict what your addition will cause the ship to do.
The grab anything that falls mechanic is also interesting as on several occasions players furiously tried to grab pieces only to cause the ship to swing wildly the other way, shedding even more pieces.

Quick and fun dexterity game whereby you are NO immediately out of contention for the win if you happen to knock a few pieces off the ship, as can be the case with many similar dexterity games.

Took a few turns to warm up to it, but overall this is a nice version of a balancing dexterity game. It maybe suffers more from wild swings than other games of its type, but Riff Raff creates the tension a dexterity game needs to muster, and surprisingly players are able to catch up even after a disaster. To top it off, at least, it looks pretty. Not my favourite dexterity game, but a good one at least.

Dex game. The game is a lot of fun even if you aren't playing and just watching. Never had a game with 100% smiles and laughing like this one. Good for all ages. Just don't play with the catch a piece as it's falling off rule with gamers as it's a way to break the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is a smidgeon of strategy, but Riff Raff really is all about the tactile and dexterous aspect of placing and catching cargo. Trying to catch the falling cargo can lead to even bigger disasters as a lunging hand can accidently knock the ship dislodging yet more pieces. It is a game that you cannot take too seriously if you play with those who quibble over every little thing then the fun will quickly drain away. For the rest of us Riff Raff is a wonderfully innovative dexterity game that plays quickly and looks stunning.

Though I like dexterity games, most of my experience so far is with flicking games. (I've never even played Jenga.) I love seeing my friends' eyes grow wide when I assemble the boat to play Riff Raff. And there's some interesting strategy in anticipating what numbers other people will play in a given round. That said, this feels a little too... simple? It doesn't take many objects to topple the whole mess, so too many turns are spent just setting an object on an empty boat.

The boat is so cool, though!

RATING: 6
A rickety wooden ship bobs and wobbles atop a cardboard ocean wave. The wooden crates, barrels, and even rats teeter precariously atop it, threatening to slide off at any moment. What piece will you place next, and where will you place it?

Yes, it's another dexterity stacking game. However, Riff Raff does offer a few twists on this tried-and-true formula. Players will simultaneously select a card. Each card corresponds to a different level of the ship. Higher numbers get to go first, but are also the most difficult places on the ship. You may want to go later in a round if you feel the other players may upset the ship before you, or earlier if you feel you can make it difficult for them. Yet each card can only be played once until they are all gone. The other twist (and one I haven't seen in any other game like this) is that when the pieces fall, any that you catch do not penalize you, and are simply removed from the game. It's fun to watch players choose between balancing the piece they are placing while trying to prepare for the "catch contingency" if things don't go as planned.

The table appeal of Riff Raff is undeniable. You see someone playing and you have to join in. Yet in the end, it's just another lightweight dexterity filler game with an unbearably high price tag.

Edit: In my second play, things fell too fast (and many were thus caught - not terribly difficult when they all fall on one side). That was less fun than the first time, but I can still recommend this much.

Our family enjoys dexterity games, and Riff Raff is one of the coolest we've played. We've never tried Bausack, Hamsterolle and the others, but this one wins on "theme" alone. 
The bits a cute, and the u-joint does its job perfectly. Looks great set up and loaded. Friends rushed out to get their own copy after one play of ours.

Can you balance a drunken sailor on a sail mast while the boat is tipping and pitching like on a high seas? A fantastic theme played with a fantastically designed ship in this dexterity game that works best with 3-4 players or even better with 3-4 groups of couples for an entertaining evening of light fun after dinner or with drinks. A must buy game for this Genre!! I love this game.TOP#13

RATING: 5
The gently pitching wooden ship is a beautifully overelaborate base for a balancing game, and it's a novelty to have the game raised high enough to allow an (often disastrous) "catch" mechanic, but it feels like it's just exercising the same muscles as any other balancing game, beyond that.

RATING: 2
A dexterity game that didn't deliver. The components look nice, but when the ship came together, it developed a natural slant. This made it nearly impossible to place more than 3 or 4 goods. Very boring and far too long of a game for what it was trying to do.

What comes to gimmick effect - this gets 10. But the game? Could have been better. It isn't bad, but not as unique as for example Hamsterrolle (allthough this is better than Bamboleo). Anyway, fun to play occassionally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Each player has the same set of "stuff" and a hand of cards numbered 1-10. Choose one card, then reveal it simultaneously with the other players. Then place anything you want onto the numbered space you chose. If the players all go to one side, the whole ship will tumble in rather unforeseeable ways to and fro, with one or more items falling off the ship with players trying to catch them quickly. Whatever you catch, goes out of the game. What falls down counts to the things you try to put on the ship. The player getting rid first of all his things, is winning the game.

It's a dexterity stack the oddly shaped stuff game. Lots of those out there but this one is a little different because the ship is on a fulcrum and might tilt over if you're not careful. There is a way to save yourself though by catching pieces on their way down that part is pretty fun.

9/2012 Dexterity game.  It's a fine balance between what's too easy and too hard.  This is of the latter type.  It's not that much fun when you don't expect, or cannot hope, to balance the pieces on the moving ship.  It's reminiscentof the much less glossy, but much more fun, game Arbos.

Good dexterity game.  I like that there are 10 rounds and the card you chose determines where you have to try and place your next piece.  I also like that if you catch a piece it works in your favour because it's out of the game but if the piece stays on, it's that much more likely to fall for your opponents.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Ultra-light dexterity game with very few decisions, none of them meaningful at all.

You just try to get rid of several shaphed and weight items by placing them on different parts of a mobile boat, 1/2 turn each turn.

I don't understand very well the physics of the boats. Many times, you load one side and the boat tilts towards the other side??? How's that?

There was a hole in the printed rules: since you can catch falling items, you could place items in such a way that would be very easy to catch them as they fell. This was adressed in the rewritten rules.

The theme feels a bit pasted on (why do you want to ge rid of items?) and at the end, you just place your items and forget about the theme.

The components are great, and the price is consequently high (maybe not too high for the components, but way to high for the entertainment value I find in the game).

Not for me. I will only play it if there's nothing else (even then, I can happily pass and just see or do other things).

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]These are really off the cuff thoughts since I've only played this once and it was a 2p game. Surprisingly though, Riff Raff was quite fun with two. We played with a random shuffle of the cards instead of selecting a card each round. With games like this I actually prefer the randomness of the card draw, which determines where on the ship you place an item, instead of studying the boat and trying to find a safe spot to place an item. 

Component wise Riff Raff is amazing. The engineering that went into the ship design payed off; every time I thought I could anticipate which way the ship would move I was wrong and hilarity ensued. The different wooden shapes you need to play on the boat are well designed and varied enough that each piece seems to affect the physics of the boat in a different way.

Overall I think Riff Raff is a great game that would benefit from having a higher player count. While the game would definitely be more fun with four, it's still limiting for a game I'd consider a party game first, dexterity game second. I'd want to play at family gatherings, but only playing up to four is kind of a bummer since lots of folks will be watching from the sideline. I don't think Riff Raff is a game I'd want to play as often as other dexterity games I enjoy [i](Animal Upon Animal and Ice Cool)[/i], but it is still great fun and I'm looking forward to playing again.[/i]

This game has fast become the one we pull out after dinner to introduce friends to board gaming. Has a great wow factor due to the intricate apparatus of the board and allows for some truly mean and vindictive play. Also has the added bonus of being able to be played with very young children. If you can track it down I highly recommend this one; a top 3 dexterity game for me.

This is a dexterity game where each turn you play a card. That card is spent for the rest of the game and matches a section of this topsy 3d wooden pirate ship. Your goal is to place or hang one of your differently shaped wooden pieces on that labeled section with the end game goal of having the fewest pieces left. When something falls that you aren't able to catch, you get it back and it counts against your score. The limitation of the card play is both one of the best and worst things about the game, because it adds this level of strategy that's both interesting and frustrating. Although it's a little bit of a labor to set up, it's very quick playing and reasonably fun.

One of the better balance games. The deck used to choose the order and location simultaneously adds some tactical element, and the ship is sufficiently unbalanced to guarantee at least a few failures during the game. Even in a game where more than one player never fail, the deck guarantees that the winner is not determined purely by the seating order.

A fun dexterity game that really brought some laughs with my wife and I.  It seems the more plays you get under your belt the most inherent the strategy for card choice and object placement become.  This was quite evident even after the second play.  One small peeve is that the engineering of the boat has a lot of play in it.  At the beginning of the game one really needs to level the boat via trial and error.  The first game we did not do this and the boat had a heavy lean to one way without any piece on the ship this made placing impossible in many instances however, our second game i realized that there was play with the ships position and when level, the game was much more interesting as shifts in the boats where quite prevalent.  Overall, just a fun dexterity game that win or lose I really just want to continue to delve into the physics of it.

Rating went 7.0 -> 6.0 -> 7.0 -> ???

Riff Raff is an odd stacking game I needed time to warm up to and see it as it is. 

On first appearance it wows you - if you want a game that looks great on the table and attracts passers-by it's a really good pick. The wobbly ships is impressive, the bits colourful.

On the second look it shows how clever it is. Unlike most stacking games where you need to lose pieces and it's more or less free how you go about it in Riff Raff there's a simultaneous card selection: the ship has ten areas labelled from 10 to 1 and each player has corresponding 10 cards. You can play each once per game. The hardest positions (higher up the mast) go first. 

On the third look it seems incredibly harsh and cruel. Unlike other stacking games where if something falls you take 2-3 items and discard the rest, here you have to take everything you don't physically catch while it's falling off. And the physics of the pendulum below the ship are nasty - when things fall on one side, they usually make the ship swing the other side. And. Everything. Falls. Down. Good luck catching all that. When this happens you're more or less out of the game. 
Also, unlike stacking games, here it's not just about bits falling off. They can slide off. You put it on the ship and it rests there. Then 5 seconds later it starts sliding, things fell off, ship swings, everything falls. Argh. 

Then you just have to accept it. Riff Raff is not as much a game of skill, but of risk. You can risk a lot, but gain a lot. And when you lose, you're out. It has an interesting mechanism where you can put two object on the ship at the same time, if there was another object there present before the turn. While it feels like a catch up mechanism, it's basically risk taking. And can help you win. 

So: looks good, feels treacherous and intense. And sometime that's a good thing.

One of the better dexterity games that I own. Most dexterity games are fairly abstract whereas this one is pretty obvious once it's pulled out of the box and setup. The biggest distinction is that each player simultaneously plays a card from their hand to determine object placement and play order each round. This simple mechanic alone boosts the game from an average 5 rating to a 7.5 rating for me.

It's fun to play and also quiet easy to learn. If you're a fan of the genre (dexterity) then you have a great choice with Riff Raff.

Zoch have just raised the bar again for crazy balancing games. A worthy addition to Bausack, Hamsterolle and Bamboleo.

An another great entry in the Zoch dexterity game.  The best components as usual.
The cards allow tactical play which is interesting.

Fun dexterity game where players load cargo onto a wooden ship, mounted on a counterweight inside the box. As cargo is loaded on, it starts to tilt and perhaps rock. If you can catch falling cargo, you're safe -- but otherwise you have to add it in later turns.

Particularly good is the system of numbered zones: players simultaneously choose a card from 1-10, each matching a part of the ship, with 9 and 10 on the top yardarm and 1-4 forming the deck. Higher numbers go first, but depending on the ship's angle, some spaces will be more attractive than others. If you choose the same number as another player and have to place immediately after them, well, better hope they leave enough room...

This kind of bluffing and second-guessing is what makes the game, since the placement itself often seems more about trying not to be the chump placing the straw that physics demands break the camel's back. One reason that Bausack and Animal Upon Animal work so well with adults is that players can scale up the bastardy and deliberately sabotage the next player. That's often much harder in Riff Raff, especially if the boat is rocking.

A fun diversion.

[Zoch 12 edition] {Boat; dexterity; optimal 4p}  This game is gorgeous!

The catching rule is a little bit fragile.

The components are top notch! Very good!

Oddly, my only real complaint with this game is that it might be too hard. 

The boat is [b]really sensitive[/b] and so it seemed that we never went a round (with 4 players) without something falling off the ship which then caused it to swing the other way at which point everything else fell off as well.

This leads to my second complaint which is a rule I really like in principle, but not in practise: If you catch anything that falls off, it goes out of the game, not into your pile of bits. This tended to result in people adding pieces to the ship whilst cupping all the other items to catch them. Essentially, playing it super-safe. :(

A beautifully elegant design though, with everything resolved so simply. Many dexterity games could learn a thing or two from how smoothly this plays.

Not sure I own a more beautiful game.  Plays smoothly with simple rules.  The price is high, but its a show stopper when out on the table.   I was winning by quite a few at one point, but then everything tumbled and I only caught 2 of them.   I soon lost to my wife.  Great fun!

While not a huge fan of dexterity games, I wanted to try this because of the visual appeal and it seemed to have a little bit more "game" to it than other stacking games. Unfortunately I find it incredibly frustrating. Maybe it's just because I'm bad at it, but I almost always make all of the pieces fall off of the boat every time, basically being eliminated from the game.

If only it supported more than 4.

I love to bring this out because it is an eye-catcher. Some dexterity games like this wear out as the novelty wears out. The beauty of Riff Raff is that it gets better with repeated plays. People not only get better at placing the cargo, but they also start to strategize about how to make harder on others or capitalize on opportunities to get rid of certain cards or load cargo.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

This is an incredible piece of Craftsmanship. I'm mostly giving it this rating because it's such a clever way of implementing a dexterity game.

Besides the awesome mechanisms, it's not better or worse than any of the other stacking games out there.

A surprisingly tactical dexterity game, with a bidding mechanism, strategic decisions, plenty of laughs and addictive solo play. Unlike other dex games this one is LITERALLY very dynamic, thanks to Cardanic hinge you can even adjust to some extend, making the game more or less wobbly.
Challenging even for adults,the more you play the greater risks you undertake to intimidate your opponents.
Haven't played anything that good in this category before.

There's not a whole lot to say about this game other than the fact that it's a very quick and easy playing dexterity game.

I don't want to downplay the game as I think that this rating seems lower than the fun that this game evoke, but I also don't want to over-analyze it either. For all intents and purposes, this is a quick and light game that can be hilarious with the right group of people and in different settings. You also can't take it too seriously... but I think that rings true for most dexterity games.

It does benefit from having a full compliment of players but can be played fine throughout the 2-4 player range.

Riff Raff is a wonderful toy, but not the best of games. It is simply too easy to catch falling pieces and games tend to be won by the first player to take an early lead, as afterwards he will simply play his cards in order from high to low and just catch anything that falls off the ship.

Adults should definitely play this game with only one hand at all times, and I would also like to test playing the game with the house rule that any time you catch pieces falling off the ship, you have to select one of them to keep, thereby penalizing you for causing the ship to tip over.

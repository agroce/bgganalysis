This is a GREAT kids' game to play with adults.  However, some adults will increase in skill faster than kids, so it can create a gap in ability unless your kids get better too.

(KIDS) Cute and a fun little game with more than 2 players.  My concern is that young players vote "no" too early and make it easy and dull for others.  Perhaps that will improve with experience.  Tried it with my 8 year old and it went great with close fits every round.

Great components and fun to play. Was fun with four adults and I can see that this is fun with children too. My only complain is that the ships could be a bit more different in size which would make turns more interesting and figuring out the right amount of pieces more difficult for players.

This is a very fun little push your luck game, combined interestingly with a speed and spatial skills element.  It is very simple to play, but also a lot of fun to sometimes fit as much as you can, and sometimes to push others into giving you points.

A good little kids game, and a great addition to the Selecta/RGG stable.

RATING FOR KIDS. Fun push-your-luck and work-as-a-team mechanisms. Unfortunately, the youngest doesn't have the spatial reasoning to approximate the animal footprint so he doesn't know when to call stop. He often stops too early, making it too easy on the others.

Great game for kids!  Simultaneous bidding (similar to Incan Gold) where each player decides whether or not to press their luck on whether or not they can complete the puzzle within the time limit using the currently selected animals.  Nice mix of large and small animals, the combination of which must figure in to the decision - great for kids to try to visualize the puzzle ahead of time.  If everyone agrees that the puzzle is solvable, another animal is added, and this continues until one or all players believe the puzzle can't be completed.  Players who believe they can finish then must prove so within the time limit or lose the points to the player(s) that declined.
Excellent components all the way around -- I think this game is going to be a keeper with the kids!

RATING: 6
Simple game where players have to estimate how many animals will fit onto an oddly shaped raft.  Players simultaneously vote yes/no on the raft and animal combination, and continue adding animals until a no vote is revealed.  Then all yes players must prove they can get the animals packed away within 60 seconds.  If they can, they score 1-6 points (depending on the round number), and if they can't then the no players score the points.  Harmless, well produced, and rather fun.

I bought this to play with my daughter but to be honest I don't really rate it that highly. Even for a kids game its too easy, and if one person just keeps on voting no it makes it far to quick and simple... Maybe I can bend the rules a bit...

RATING: 8.5
Teljes siker :). Lassan a Kislányom eléri az 5 éves kort és ez a "hány állat fér el a tutajon" tematikájú játék (valószínűleg az állatok miatt) a legnépszerűbb otthoni játék mostanában. Persze ehhez nagyban hozzájárul az is, hogy a felnőttek is élvezetesnek találják a játékmenetet. Röviden, kiválasztunk a 6 lehetséges tutaj közül egyet, melynek fedélzetén különböző méretű és formájú kivágás található, melyet meg kell tölteni, szigorúan fektetett elhelyezésű állatokkal. Van itt mindenféle méretű állat, ami egy állatkertben előfordulhat, az elefánttól kezdve a kígyón át egészen a csirkéig :). Majd felcsapunk 10 darab állatokat ábrázoló kártyalapot és ráhelyezzük a hozzájuk tartozó állat figurákat, hogy láthassuk, pontosan milyen formával és méretekkel rendelkeznek. Majd jön egy szavazós fázis, amikor arról kell dönteni, hogy a kiválasztott 10 állat vajon elfér-e az adott tutajon (a tutaj kivágásában). Ha mindenki igennel szavaz, akkor egy újabb állattal kell bővíteni a tutajra felkerülő állatok listáját. Ezt addig kell végrehajtani, amíg valaki vagy valakik nemmel szavaznak. Ekkor az igennel szavazók bebizonyíthatják, hogy igenis elfér az a rengeteg állat ilyen kis tutajon :). Persze ez nem jön mindig össze, mivel homokórával kell mérni a rendelkezésre álló időt. Persze a homokórát a Kislányomnál még nem alkalmazzuk, csak a felnőtteknél. Aki(k)nek igaza lett az pontot kap. Ezt megismételjük még 5 másik tutajjal és más állatokat kiválasztva és a végén kiszámoljuk ki tippelt ügyesebben. Szerintem nagyon szórakoztató játék, még akkor is, ha a Kislányom csak két egymást követő játékot képes a szabályok szerint végig játszani, utána átalakul a társasjáték állatkertes játékká :).

Rating for kids game.
Fun observation/dexterity family game.  At the beginning of the game, you put 10 card with an animal on it.  You then place the corresponding wooden animal on each card.  Then, each player vote if they think that all the animal fit on the raft.  If all the player vote yes, you draw another card and all the player vote again.  You repeat this until at least one player vote differently than the others.  Then, the players who vote yes have to fit the animals on the raft before time's run out.  The players who were right receive point.  A game last 6 round, the raft size is different each round and the point received each round is also different (1st round 1 point, 2nd 2 point, etc.) so it's possible for a player who fail the first 2 round to catch up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great fun game that is really cool to play. It is often great fun when you are with a player(s) who won't concede and thus you can force the raft to have way too many animals and laugh and the greed of the other player(s)!

Zoowaboo is a really well produced and beautiful children's game.  And it really is just for kids.  I found it to be rather elementary, and that's what it's supposed to be.  While it's not something I would ever go out of my way to play with adults, with children, that's a different story.  I think I might send this over to my youngest niece as she would have a real blast with it.  So, while it might not rank high for me, I think it's a pretty big winner for kids.

子供には受けないゲームと勘違いしていた。枠の中に動物をうまく詰めるのが非常に面白いらしい。続けて行うゲームではないが、息子(6才)が気に入っているゲームの一つ。このゲームの前後に必ず、ワニに乗るのように積み木ゲームをしている。また、付属のカードを使ってワニに乗るデュエルを行う場合もある。ワニにのるを持っていれば、多少厚さは違うが一緒にして積み木ゲームとして使っている。子供ゲームの中でも出色の出来。大人だけの場面では出番がないので、それが欠点。

Fun little game of playing chicken and trying to estimate how many animals will fit in a little space.  Tough for very small children who are panicked to press their luck too far.  Not so easy for the adults to gague: I routinely underestimated how many would fit.

RATING: 6
A random boat and a random assortment of animals are pulled out.  Your job is to determine if you think all of the animals can fit in the boat.  If you everybody votes YES you pull another animal and vote again until at least one person votes NO.  Once somebody votes NO the sand timer is flipped over and the NO team must try to fit all the animals in the boat.  Pretty fun and probably a higher rating for children.  As per usual Selecta provides superb pieces.

10 cards are drawn, you pick yes or no if you think they'll all fit. The yeses try to make it fit in 30 seconds. They get points if they make it work and the nos get points if the animals won't fit.

Yesterday I had my first ever play of Zoowaboo with the company of two 5 years old and a 7 years old children.

The art and design is pretty good and appealing to children.

They found the rules a bit confusing to start with but they worked them out pretty quick, maybe after 3 rounds.

In general the game went down pretty well, however I found that they were more interested in fitting the animals inside the raft than actually winning the game so they just kept voting Yes until I decided to vote No.

At the end of the game I won and they lost (no mercy) but they did not seem annoyed at all as they did most of the play, I was just there collecting my point at the end of each round.

I can see potential for this game to be a "keeper" but I would like to have seen maybe some rule variations to make it more interesting. Although I am sure the original rules are good enough if the "participants" make more of an effort.

As a note I will add that I am glad I only paid £8 for it, more than that would not be justified.

(After reading the rules:) Feels like a children's game that could be very fun with adults too.

Update (21.11.2010): After the first actual game I can see it would be fun with kids. To them even this how-can-we-fit-all-these-animals part of the game probably is challenging. As for adults the game feels just a tad too simple although it is pretty hard to evaluate if there is room or not.

Boy a lot of animals can fit on those rafts! This is a really nice game to play with kids or as kids (we adults don't mind playing kids games)! In a 2-player game it does seem a bit easy to fit plenty of animals on that raft and have room for more! But I suspect with kids playing and with more players the game should be a little more balanced! Needs more plays!

Quite fun, and helped along by the usual gorgeous Selecta components (which bear some resemblance to the animals in Haba's Tier auf Tier, albeit without the painted details).

Good for adults too as a quick filler - the coop nature of the 'fill in the raft' puzzle is good fun.

RATING: 4
It's not a bad idea, but essentially you're playing the same 3 minute game six times, so I don't see a lot of replay in it. A raft board gets put out with a big empty space in it, and whole bunch of Tier On Tier type animals are placed around it. Each player simultaneously reveals whether they think all the animals will fit. If yes, keep adding animals till someone says no. Once someone says no, all the yes players have 60 seconds to try and place all the animals in the empty raft space (on their sides). If they succeed, the yes players get points equal to the round number, otherwise the no players get the points. So the fun is the assessment (first) and the placement under time pressure (second). Good for real littlies would be my guess, 5 and under.

RATING: 5
This game should be an excellent family game, but some issues arise.  First of all, I have found adults to be much better at it than kids, which in this game means that the kids don't actually get to participate much in the game -- you only get to do the tiling activity when you win a bid, so kids get frustrated when they overbid (and lose) or underbid (and don't even get to play).

The game can be adapted to be cooperative with some work, although it doesn't really translate that naturally.

In the end, I don't think it works for families, and it a bit too complex for kids alone, so it doesn't seem to really work.

With just adults, I find it too easy to correct guess the answer -- the volume of the animal is almost all that matters, not the exact shape.  So, for a given raft volume, it's pretty easy to tell if a group of animals will fit or not.  So, with a simple heuristic (which I learned after about 10 minutes with the game), you can get the right answer 80% or more of the time, with little attention to spatial puzzles or time pressure.

1 play, 2er

Very cute spatial puzzle game, even for adults. 

--- Summary ---
There are several large tiles with cutouts representing rafts. Each round, place one in the center of the board. Deal out 10 animal cards, which have matching wooden meeples placed nearby. Players simultaneously vote (using yes/no vote chips) on whether or not all the represented animals would fit in the raft. If all say "yes", draw the next animal card. If all say "no", discard 1 card. If there's a mix, flip the timer; all "yes" voters work to fit the meeples into the cutout before the timer runs out. If successful, the yes-voters earn VP (1-6, increasing each of the 6 rounds); if not, the no-voters earn VP. The player with the most points after the 6 rounds wins!

Decent fun, but hard to play as a family game without dumbing down to the kids' level of play. In my experience, children have a harder time estimating whether the animals will fit or not, and tend to get steamrolled in this game. Plus, some children (my youngest daughter included) will not enjoy the aspect of being the lone player puzzling or not puzzling with the others.

It's very cute though.

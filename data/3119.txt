Fired Scattergories. You have thirty seconds to write down answers in a list, then bid on how many answers you'll reveal. Low bidders go first and you can't repeat answers so there's a tightrope in the answers you write down and what you bid, because if you don't make your bid you get skunked in the round. 

Can work with just about any "name it and claim it" card game, plus you can cobble the rest together with spare parts.

Recommended.

A very good word game that is sorely in need of an English translation.  We use the cards from "A to Z" and they work perfectly.

In general, word games have a very hard time impressing me. I have a horrible recall for some reason, and the exercise generally isn't that enjoyable. Haste Worte? is at least something that I would play once in a while without major objections. It's the word game for people like me, because the players write down words that fit into a certain category, and then bid how many words they will have. The rub is that the lower bids get to read first, and anything that they say cannot be said by the later players. People with high scores also have handicaps to make life slightly more difficult.

This is still nothing that I could see myself requesting, but it is one of the few word-oriented party games that I don't actively avoid, which is deserving of an above-average rating in and of itself. The bidding takes the overall game concept, which I don't particularly care for, and makes it more enjoyable for everyone at the table, both the word-masters, and the...ahem...challenged.

I do really like the betting mechanism in this game. It forces you to come up with words that the other players hopefully don't think of. It sounds so great in theory. But it somehow doesn't work in our games and I guess it is because the categories aren't restrictive enough. For example, there is the category: "Things you can see at the beach". When this one came up, everyone wrote down 10+ words. And guess what: They didn't overlap that much. So everyone scored around 8 points, like in nearly every round we played.

Maybe this game needs more players. I'll try to test this. But with three players Haste Worte was too easy.

Someone needs to publish a good English edition of this excellent German party game!

The idea behind the game is simple. Someone reads a category from one of the cards. It might be something like "Beatles songs" or "college majors." Everyone has a short amount of time to write down as many answers as they can, and also must secretly indicate how many of their answers they will read. Whoever bids lowest reads a number of answers equal to their bid, and scores that many points. Players continue to read their answers in the order of their bids, with the highest bid reading last. The tricky part is that no one is allowed to give an answer that a previous player has already given. So a higher bid will score more points (potentially), but it's hard to predict how many of your answers will be "used up" by the time your turn arrives.

The brilliant method of bidding and scoring is what really makes Haste Worte stand out. It's the game that Scattergories and Outburst want to be when they grow up.

The bidding takes a simple "category" game and makes it a wonderful challenge.
Can be played with gamers and family, which is an extra benefit.

I definitely enjoyed the game, and I can appreciate the strength of the underlying mechanism, but in practice it was a little too easy to achieve your bidding objective.

I don't know why no one has done an English language version, there has to be a better way than translating the German cards (which is what I've had to do).

The concept is fun but I think it is too prone to devolve into rules discussions which kills the fun in any party game.

I usually stink at word party games but this one is a hoot to play but only with the right group (of fair-minded rules) people.  I do lousy half the time but it's a lotta fun.  Word/trivia gamers would really dig this and the auction with final leg "limitations" (adds balance from runaway leads) to make this an excellent game.  If you have the edition with the cards used as the board track, you can lengthen or shorten the game suitable with the group's taste.  Finally, a party game that really actually has strategy!

What a great "party" game.   Unlike most party games this one doesn't just rely on players knowledge coming into the game.  It's more than just a contest; one needs to use their wits to bid correctly.  Play is similar to Boggle+Scattergories in that players write down as many words as possible for a given topic.  However, the bidding completely changes everything.  The low bidder reads off words first (the number of words bid), then so on.  Everybody crosses off a word that's been read off.  The highest bidder must hope that he has enough words left over, to match his bid, after everybody else has read off their words.  Players that can read off the number of words matching their bids earn points equal to their bid amount.  Near the end of the game the board has some catch-up mechanisms where players in front must also contend with constraints such as (words less than 5-letters, read two words for each bid point, etc.)

It is like a game "flash". however, you must write something different from others to score high. Also bidding for high score is very interesting mechanics.

Interesting word game but the scoring system is just too gamey - I don't see this appealing to a very broad spectrum of players like a party game should.

RATING: 8
Really nice word finding game and the betting how many different words you will be able to reveal can be quite tense - if you bet too high you might not have enough different words left, if you bet too low the others will get a hugh lead on you. The handicap can really bring the leading player to  a grinding stop, but that's what it is supposed to do I guess :-) It is quite interesting to see how differently or how similarly the players assosiate with the given  term.

I hate word games, but this one was a blast. Good amount of tension throughout, especially when choosing how much to risk. Very fun. EDIT: Deleted my rating, since I played it so long ago. No real memory of the game.

Wow, I remember when I liked games like Outburst.  Then I played them a few times and realized that most of the time you win based on getting the right card for your knowledge.  Then I played Scatagories, but I grew board of it quickly.  Of those types of word games Boggle is about the only game I still play.

Haste Worte though, combines elements of all of those games, and adds a fantastic auctioning mechanism.  You auction the points you plan to score, ala hearts.  Of course those that predict a lower score get to go first and eliminate words they picked from your list.  Fantastic fun.

Kramer has done it again.

UPDATE: I decided to upgrade this to a 10 because in my mind it is the perfect party game.  Really it is probably an 8.5 compared to other games, but undoubtedly this is the best I've played in its catagory.

+ always fun, large variety of categories, duration of a game can be adjusted by players before the game

We usually play a variation, where players only receive points for the marked answers if these are not on any other player's list. So if Person 1 writes down answers a, b, and c, and then marks b and c, and Person 2 writes down a, b, d, and e and marks d and e, then Person 1 does not receive his two points (because his marked answer b appears on the list of Player 2 as well), but Person 2 does. This variation messes with some of the handicaps.

Sehr gelungenes Spiel für Gruppen! Simple Regeln (jeder schreibt möglichst viele Begriffe zu einem vorgegebenen Thema auf), aber der Clou ist das einschätzen der eigenen Antworten. Man muss nämlich nach dem Notieren schätzen, wie viele Antworten man sich zutraut. Punkte gibt es nur für vorgelesene Worte, egal wie viele man zusätzlich noch auf seinen Zettel geschrieben hat. Der Spieler mit der niedrigsten gelegten Zahl beginnt mit dem Vorlesen, so dass derjenige, der um die meisten Punkte spielt zum Schluss dran ist. Fieserweise muss er alle Begriffe von seinem Zettel streichen, die seine Mitspieler vorlesen. Riskiert man also auf eine hohe Zahl zu setzen oder geht man lieber auf Nummer sicher und liest zuerst für weniger Punkte vor?

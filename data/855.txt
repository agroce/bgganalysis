It would have been much better had Kramer kept his action point trilogy down to a Duet. Even if you're not prone to analysis paralysis this can get too mind blowing to work out.

RATING: 8
Action point system with multiple ways to score, tile-laying (including multi-layered), and excellent scalability.

This game is the heaviest of the mask trilogy (Tikal, Mexica, Java), and surprisingly like the others, it is similar yet feels quite different.  There are 6 action points per turn, several options, including tile-laying (which has elements similar to Torres in that you can grow upwards and always want to be highest), placing and immediately scoring water tiles, building and immediately scoring temples (partial points), and having festivals and immediately scoring.

Then there is the jockeying for position for the end game to score larger points for the temples.  The components are top-notch, and alot of thought went into the tile design, and the ruleset to make for a very balanced, highly strategic game.  If you like the action point games, this is a must have.  Rating will likely go up with more plays.

RATING: 7
Fantastic design and components, but the ever-so-slightly bewildering rules meant we've never been sure we're playing it properly! And it does go on a bit; the action-point system giving the players too many options to think about.

An excellent tile-laying, action-point game, with serious weighty decisions to be made at every turn. Thick tiles and the 3-D nature of the tile-laying (placing on top of existing tiles) add to the tactile nature of the game, and the artwork is lovely. The brief bidding wars over who gets to host a festival at the end of each turn add a lighter touch, and a tiny dose of luck to keep things interesting. A quality package from start to finish, I'm shocked this has remained out of print for so long.

Just finished my second game, which was my first three-player game and "doc-tor, my brain hurts!"  A great game with so much sutblety -- but also, clearly, tons of strategy -- to the point that I would say this is the most intense level of difficulty in a game I can bear to even approach.  It's one of those games I'll probably almost never, if ever, win, because I just can't calculate so many possibilites -- I get the opposite of analysis paralysis with games like this -- I recognize that there are tons of choices I haven't even thought about yet and don't have the patience to contemplate them, so I just make an impulsive move and hope it works out.  

This is also why I haven't rated it higher -- I can't honestly say that I would play a brain-burner like this anytime someone suggested it.

Update: I've since played it yet again and have been "forced" to up my rating -- it still makes my brain hurt, but it's also kind of addictive ...

RATING: 8
One of the three games in the mask series of action point games. This is a very nice game but it requires some heavy duty thinking. The 3D aspect of the game and the large number of possible configurations you can assemble on your turn also results in some long turns. There is little you can do in between turns since the board will change quite drastically and in unpredictible ways. The game is also quite attractive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game of thinking and choices. It's almost pure tactics, with some room for strategy and planning ahead. I can see some people not liking this game because it can sometimes take a while for a player to decide what to do with their turn while everyone else can only sit and wait, but I think that is what makes it great. Each turn is ripe with decision and possibilities: how should you spend your 6 Action Points? Easy to understand on the first playing after a good reading of the rulebook. Only played 2 player games so far, and it was great (unlike some games, which are unlawfully listed as 2-player for evil marketing reasons). I imagine it plays well with any amount of players (2-4).

Very interesting in much the same way mexica is. The AP system can generate AP but it's not terrible in the right group. I like the 3D aspect of this game, it looks great on the table and there is plenty to consider. I would love to watch 'high level' java play (if it exists), because while there is a lot to consider and tons of possible options, it seems very hard to really stop someone else from scoring until the very end of the game.

12+, 2-4 players, best with 3 but plays well with 2, 120 mins. Holiday box. With Tikal and Mexica is one of the Mask Trilogy of games. Said to be deeper than the other two. Beautifully made tiles.

Feels to me like a mix of (a less thematic) Tikal and Taj Mahal with a bit of Torres thrown in.  Doesn't really have that fun factor, and there are a lot of ways to score similar amounts of points which could promote the game's legendary AP.  Not hot on it, but happy enough to revisit.

I enjoyed Java as an intellectual exercise, but unlike the best games I enjoy in that way (Power Grid, Rheinlander) it didn't provoke any of that weasel-in-the-stomach tension that makes a game memorable for me.

Kb. olyan szintű élményt adott, mint a Tikal... Nagyon hasonló a pontrendszere, itt is tetszik az az ötlet, hogy eltérő időpontokban kapják a játékosok a játékvégi pontokat. Elég nagy szabadságot ad az akciók kiválasztásában, épp emiatt nagyon elnyúlhat... Átütőnek nem nevezném, de szívesen játszom vele máskor is.

I'm truly a fan of the Kramer/Kiesling games, and also Java has a nice playing system. This game scores not more than a 7 because of the slow playing. Java has a complex system of laying tiles and you can't think in advance what you possibly want to do in your next turn. That's the big disadvantage with its cousins Tikal and Mexica.

My favorite of the Mask Trilogy.  Why would I ever consider playing Tikal when my heart is set on Java?    

This is definitely a gamer's game of spacial awareness.  I would only suggest this abstract for players who rarely suffer from Analysis Paralysis!  Once you figure out how to orientate the tiles more easily in your head, the puzzle aspect and player screwage becomes infinitely more enjoyable.  Java is also one of the most visually beautiful boardgames that I have ever played.   

The palace festivals were a brilliant design concept.  The inherent risk/reward system of holding a palace festival provides balance to the overall game design.  Otherwise players would probably avoid any palace building until all of the irrigation tiles had been scored.  The festival cards also ensure that every game will play out differently.  The length of playtime and the difficulty of placing community tiles can vary widely depending on the placement of irrigation tiles.  I find that several narrow chains of irrigation tiles in close proximity make for a more challenging and thus a more AP-prone game.  Other than possible AP issues, I dislike the tiny Palace Festival cards.  I hate tiny cards!

[i]Posted: 2/1/06, Rated: 6[/i]

The backstory: the first game of the "mask trilogy" that I played was [i][thing=54]Tikal[/thing][/i].  It was said to be the easiest of the three.  I enjoy it immensely.  I then looked at [i]Java[/i], and saw that it was considered to be the "beefier" game.  Sounded great to me, so here we are.

The board in [i]Java[/i] is beautiful.  It is very reminiscent of [i][thing=54]Tikal[/thing][/i].  At first blush you might think that it was the same game, only with smaller hexagons so more tiles could fit onto the board.  The tiles themselves are amazingly thick -- unbelievably so.  The rules explain the game well, provide good examples, and have excellent illustrations.

If these comments feel dry so far, then you're not far from how I felt about playing the game.  It's [i]nice[/i].  The overlapping placement of land tiles is interesting.  Developer movement is interesting.  I see the quandary between creating avenues of access of the same terrain type versus expanding cities or villages, trying to maximize your action points.  The festival bidding is...[i]interesting[/i].  It adds a much needed break to the tile placement dilemma, and provides an alternate scoring mechanism for people who can't get the "highest rank" in a city to improve its temple.

Yet for all of these interesting mechanics, [i]Java[/i] has failed to move me.  The game works, and I can see its potential, but it hasn't yet clicked with me the way that [i][thing=54]Tikal[/thing][/i] has.  This view might change if played with the right group, and I'd play if asked, but at the moment I have other titles that I would like to bring to the table.

Having enjoyed "Tikal" and "Taluva", I thought I might like this: action point system, 3-d board. It just seemed overly complex for what it was and the festivals seemed tacked on; so much so, I dropped them for the 2nd game and no-one felt they were missing much.

Got this with some Christmas money, and played it for the first time last night.  It takes awhile to get into the rhythm of the game and learn to track everything you need to keep track of (the demands on your ability to multi-task are considerable), but once you get the hang of it it turns out to be a fascinating game.  One of the best I'v eplayed recently.

Excellent game. Much better than Tikal. True, it takes a while for each person to take their turn--especially with four players, because you can't think about your turn ahead of time, as the board keeps changing--but I found it interesting watching other people think through their turns by placing tiles in different places, trying things out. It gave me ideas about the possibilities on my own turn. The 3D aspect is awesome. The board looks really cool as the landscape gets built out and up. There's a lot to think about and too many possibilities to consider, but that's the challenge: training your brain to detect the best opportunities and be creative with the tiles.

Just a ton going on and how to score.  You really have to work at scoring almost every turn as it seems like you nickle and dime all your points until the end.  End game scoring is big and you need to prep for it a few turns ahead.  So, you need to keep that in mind all game as you work and scramble to pick up points.  The game looks quite awesome as it goes along.  AP can be pretty bad, but I don't understand where the huge general consensus is about it really being best with two.  I think three would be awesome...more pressure, tighter game.  Yeah, it would take longer, but I don't mind a longer game if it sucks me in.  This one did.  This was also the last of the Mask Triogy I have played.  Mexica is my favorite, then it would be a toss up, right now, with this and Tikal.  I need another play or two to see.  But, I can see that this can get deep.

After my second play, shot past Tikal.  More movement in this one.  Me likie.

I'd like to try it with more, but I'm not sure that adding more players is going to make a huge difference.  Irrigation tiles seem to be overly powerful.  With six action points, it seems too easy to move your guy next to an existing irrigation tile, plop down a few more, close the lake in, and score a slew of points.  Maybe we were doing something wrong?

Incredibly deep tile-laying / worker placement game. It shares many spatial elements with Torres and Pueblo. Excellent design! That being said, it is a real brain-burner and may be overlong (especially when playing against individuals afflicted with AP).

1/18/05 - 1 play regular game. 2 plays just using irrigation tiles. After the first play - what a rich gaming experience - so much to do. This game requires or rather rewards creative thinking and game play. You will need to see what isn't there to do well at this game. The components in this game are outstanding. Different ways to score points in the game. The board is basically built as you go so it will always be different and fresh. Nice...very nice!

Yet another very good Kramer and Kiesling abstract design. It's very similar in feel to their other action allocation + area majority games like Torres, Tikal, and Bison: Thunder on the Prarie. I really like all of these games, but I prefer Tikal for its theme and feeling of exploration, Bison for its small box and varied resources, and Torres for its card play. Java is good, but I just don't need another game of this type in my collection. Sold.

I really enjoy games that reward clever play, so this one is a winner in my book!  There is a lot of room for creative and cunning tile placement.  The only odd things to me were the rush for big water points early in the game, and the end-game scoring.  It seems that being able to trigger the end-game is fairly powerful, as it becomes tougher and tougher to score the further you are from the person that triggers the end-game.  Still, a really cool game that looks beautiful to boot!

Michael Kiesling & Wolfgang Kramer (2 plays)Geeks who hate Analasis Paralasis should stay clear of this one.  Very deep.  Many ways to score and win.  The problem is there is no reason to watch during the five minutes between turns as you cant plan anything until the tiles are placed.  Only for two players. IMO

RATING: 7.5
Java is the least elegant in mechanics but most engaging of the Kramer Action Point series of games.  It lacks the accessibility and structure of Tikal, but it does offer and reward brilliant tactical play.  It is also the most beautiful component-wise of the series.  The card play is not a fantastic mechanic, and the final scoring makes up too much of a player's total score. However, it has the most fully realized use of action points in the series, and I would like to delve as deep with this one as I have with Tikal.

Fantastic game.  I like the spatial aspects, the action point system that never seems to have just the right amount of points, and the aesthetic is beautiful.

Highly interactive spatial puzzle with a lot of blocking, sneakiness and overall unpleasantness. It can be played in a non confrontational manner, but half of the fun is gone. Although it is an Action Point allowance game, there is very limited AP, since the players ought to be constantly engaging and evaluating possible variations. The card game seems unnecessary, so minus points for this one, but the rest of the game is elegant, with an organic way of evolving in the 3d space. Lovely and beautiful game, in need of a bit more modern development.

RATING: 7
I like the action point games. Java has some mechanics very reminiscent of Torres, with the vying for control of palaces for endgame scoring. The components are beautiful. There is a beautiful tension between scoring now and setting up for scoring at the end. There is a nice mechanic in the endgame triggering, where you have influence over it with the tile consumption. Did I mention that this is a beautiful game? 

There is a lot to think about. But somehow, the theme of the game doesn't seem to work as well as the other K&K AP games. It may be true that Java is the heaviest of them, and therefore I'd expect it to be my favorite. Right now the jury is out. Sadly, this didn't go over well with the gamers I would most expect to have a chance for success....so I'm not sure I'll have a lot of opportunities for further play.

RATING: 9
Of the 4 modern action point games, Java is my favourite. The game plays longer than any of them, but I like everything that this one brings to the table. Here, players have the typical AP menu of options...add pieces to the board, move your guys around. In Java, pieces can be built in 3 dimensions, like Torres, but it is rather more complicated because the normal pieces are 3 hexes large, and pieces may not be placed directly on top of player pieces, water spaces, or identically sized pieces (i.e.: you may not put a 3 hex piece directly on top of a 3 hex piece, it has to have at least one of its hexes resting on a different piece).

Unlike the other games in the series, Java has a definite flow. The early game is necessarily dominated by irrigation scoring. Once those are used up, then city/palace building and festivals become the major source of points. Of course, from that point, it's not just about scoring points immediately, but also about consolidating one's position for the grand final scoring, which is generally where about 1/3 to 1/2 of one's final points come from.

Java is actually somewhat similar to some other, recent games like Kramer's Australia, or Dorn's Baumeister von Arkadia in that it is a game of recognizing the state of the board, and taking as much advantage of it as possible. Most of your decisions here are driven by tactics, though there is some room for general strategic choices, and there are methods of protecting certain areas of the board; if you're willing to invest enough resources. Unlike those later games though, I feel that Java is not as much about not giving your left hand opponent a gift as it is about helping yourself out the most. In the early going, you do have to be careful about leaving lucrative water placement areas wide open, but overall I feel like Java is more about taking advantage for yourself than just avoiding gifts to your opponents, and I like that.

The only real downside to Java, for me, is that it is a game that only strongly appeals to a certain type of mind. I could play this game every week, but no one else that I play with feels that way, which means it only comes out a couple of times a year. I might also add that the scoring system means that this game should only ever be played with 3 or 4. I like it best with 3 (more control, you get more turns) but I don't mind it with 4, as long as everyone plays reasonably fast. A game that you do not want to play with analysis paralysis types!

Looks great and is at least worth a play or two, but is about as fun as a bag of sticks- yet another Euro optimization routine but this time compounded with action points so the AP crowd can really drive you insane.

Finally got this on the table. Well worth it. Yes it is slightly similar to Tikal but not nearly as similar as the settlers versions are to each other. So on its own its still a great game. The turns don't take too long unless you allow people to take all the time they want. I'm really not sure why Tikal and Java have been dogged with this label as being slow. You can easily get your turn done in 30 seconds so even in a four player game it would be no more than a few minutes till your turn. Further to that, what the other players are doing is still important to you and interesting. Also you can certainly start analysing your situation before the player on your right is finished.

Played with two players. I find it problematic to keep track of the activity points that are already used up. Also the height differences are not easy to see, after all its just a few milimeters if its just one level. The rule "do not place a tile exactly on top of another tile of the same size" also requires realy intensive checking what tile is underneath, looking for tile borders. I could imagine that more players would make the wating time too long. Great artwork, lots of nice bits.

After playing again recently, I think I've flip-flopped, and now prefer this to Tikal/Mexica, all things being equal. But all things aren't equal. Java is longer. Especially with 1st time players. In fact, I've decided I simply won't introduce this to new players that have shown any propensity to be slow thinkers/players. So while enjoy this more, it's rare that I actually get to play it, as my limited gaming time really makes me focus on my efficiency of gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Update:  After more plays of Tikal and Java, this has moved up in rating for me.  I might prefer this over Tikal at this point.

-----
The most ponderous of the Kramer & Kiesling games and the action point mechanism. Considering Tikal and Mexica, Java might be the deepest of the three, but the three dimensional aspect really makes one have to think and visualize, slowing down the quick players and making the turns of those who poke along ridiculous.  All this makes this a once a year type of game for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Java is an exhausting game to play. Action points tax the brain more than usual already, but adding a third dimension in tile laying really gives the grey matter a run for its money. Playing this game well is a tricky job, but the experience is always satisfying, save in one particular case. More on that later.

When I compare Java with Tikal (as one is wont to do since the titles are so closely related and Java came second in the Mask Trilogy), then a few things stand out. Java doles out less AP to the players, and introduces the concept of scoring as you play. Tikal only gives the players points during scoring rounds; Java only has one big scoring round, right at the end of the game. Less AP seems to be limiting, but the three dimensional aspect makes more than up for it. Don't think your choices are diminished in any way. What truly is different between the two games is that Java's tile laying aspect is much more challenging. You can attack other players in three dimensions, and positions you thought safe can be compromised with a few deftly placed tiles. You notice the difference in playing the two games: Tikal has more schwung to it and can be played intuitively (well, at least by me); Java requires some thought.

Now to Java's dark side: playing with 4 players. The problem is that the final scoring round gives the player a large chunk of points. A [i]decisive[/i] chunk of points. So you'd think that everyone gets a fair share of the pie. That is not the case: the positioning which goes on at that time usually screws the fourth player bigtime. All easily accessible spots are taken at that point, and there are no big tiles anymore with which to create connections to squeeze in here and there. The result: go last and lose. The only remedy is an agressive pre-positioning strategy, but pulling this off is difficult to say the least, and not fair on the player who is preparing this way, as he might not need such preparations in the first place. It's simply better to gamble on not being the [size=5]sucker[/size] who's going last. I suggested a variant [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/258127/fixing-the-last-player-problem-in-a-4-player-game]here[/url] to deal with this issue, but never received feedback, nor was able to get the game to the table in the meantime to test it out myself. It remains an open issue with this game, and for as long it persists, the game gets one point deduction.

One play. Gorgeous board, and somewhat thematic in that the island genuinely does seem to grow and evolve... to a point. Nonetheless, I don't think I'll be rushing to play this again.

This is the gamer's hardcore game. It's in my opinion the most convoluted and complex game of the AP trilogy, and probably the one I want to play the least - but that's only because the other two (Mexica and Tikal) are so darn good. But don't get me wrong, Java is a great game, and one of the most beautiful in my collection.  The only complaint I have is that it feels like somehow overcomplicated for what it is, and perhaps it could have been streamlined somewhat - although in saying that, I haven't got a clue what specifically I would take away from the system.

Since there are so much possible choices and decisions to make turns can take awhile for beginners. Consider a chess clock for turns.

Of this Kramer series, I have played this and Mexica. I think Java is the better game, yet Mexica is faster and possibly more fun. For that reason, I've rated them both the same. I think this game is probably a brilliant strategy game, but having said that, it's still not my cup of tea. It's rather dry, it can go on too long, and it's a real brain burner. But with the right crowd, it could be great. There is certainly a lot of depth here. The theme and artwork are very nice too. Used to own, but TRADED.

I would need another play of Java to get a better understanding on what to do during my turn. What is the best option where your actions is concerned ? There is a lot to learn in a first game. Java is very deep. Not as easy to learn as Mexica and Tikal.

There is lots of calulating to do. I played Java once a long time ago. Another game of Java will refresh my memory on how the game works.

I received the game from my cousin as a gift.

TRADED Java in a game trade.

RATING: 5
As with Tikal, this is a design that I respect because it's an interesting one but I found it a bit dull to play.  As with Tikal, maximizing your action points is the key to victory and due to this fact, the game is very prone to AP.  It's also a lot harder to plan your turn in advance compared to Tikal due to the ever-changing environment and possible changes in majority.  Based on Tikal and Java, it might seem that I dislike action-point systems, but Pandemic and Blood Rage for me are games that have instilled this mechanism without hindering the flow of the game.  I guess it must be K&K's action point games.  I guess things aren't boding well for Mexica but I'll still try to give it a fair shake.

Excellent quality 3d building game with an action point allowance system. My only beef with the game is the underdeveloped party mechanic. You can hold a party on any resort on which you have a marker. There should be forces at work making you want to choose one over another.

This is a game requiring a lot of thought that might border on analysis paralysis.  It is engaging, intriguing, and the board can change on the laying of a tile.  I have only played it once, but want to come back and try it again as I find it intriguing. The session report I wrote on this and the comments I received were spot on.  But this game holds promise that tugs at my interest.

Fell flat for me and my group and we're big Tikal fans and Kramer fans in general. The vertical area control is clever but ends up being too much like an abstract for me. Planning is far less strategic than Tikal as the board changes so much before your turn which results in AP and lots of downtime. I get that from a calculation point of view, there's a lot to chew on here for people who like that. 

I find the game ends up being less about what's happening on the board in terms of anticipating others' moves and more about you calculating the best options presented to you at the start of your turn. When it came around to me again, I didn't find myself excited at the options before me the way I am in Tikal. Stealing temples from people in Tikal and locking things down is a lot more fun, so I'll just stick with good ol' Tikal.

(2-4 players) Not bad.  Beautiful to look at.  Nice 3D element.  But like Capitol, the board feels a bit loose to me (even with the full number of players) in that the early game doesn't include much competition.  I guess it depends on player style(?).  And you really need to understand how the last round works and when it's coming to be able to fully capitalize on the scoring possibilities.

Played 5+ times. A bit heavier than Tikal, I think I can make a comparison: Java is to Tikal what Go is to Chess. Both great games, but Java/Go are more wide open and take a broader pattern of strategy than Tikal/Chess. Tikal could be played with non-gamers, but I doubt Java will be. However the rich wide-open play of this game makes it a phenomenal game. The more you play it with experienced players, the more depth and skill will be employed -- and therefore enjoyment should get even better. (Bought from Funagain. Traded for Union Pacific. Got in trade for Vinci. Traded this and Power Grid Benelux for Finca and Small World.)

RATING: 7
This is the last of the Mask Trilogy games to play--liked them all (Mexica & Tikal).   All are strategy, tile laying games.

This one, Java, I think has more avenues for strategy in which case 4 players makes it too long a game if the other players brain-burn.  (2 hrs plus, with down time I object to.  You can plan your moves, but the player before you can dramatically change your plans.)


The setup for Java is more fiddly.

Festivals are interesting--a face up card determines the suitable cards to win the auction.  If you don't have any any of this card's symbol in your hand you must (for an action pt.) pick that card up in hopes the next card will fit your hand.  Since action pts are limited, and the festival also costs an aciton pt, there might not be enough A.P.s to then hold the festival.

The level of the occupied terrain determines who has rank.  My board is warped and sometimes this creates some confusion.

The rules are all in black & white and I think if it were in color, my confusion over a major rule would have been resolved much faster.

Beautiful board & cards.

RATING: 8
[Action Point Game, Tile-laying, Spatial, Area Majority] {2P:8, 3P:8, 4P:8} One of the most wide-open German game available. Superior in depth to its siblings, Tikal and Mexica. Different, but just as fantastic and exhiliaratingly FUN as its first cousin, Torres. The game elements seem disparate at first glance, combining tiles, cards and 3-D gameplay, but they suprisingly mesh well together. The theming of the game is good, but not as strong as Torres. The sense of exploration is just as strong as Tikal's, but Java does not suffer from Tikal's stutter-step scoring via volcano. A great deal of forward planning is necessary, and not just due to the final-state scoring - if you play with players who do not consider the board and their following turn while others move, they will take a long time on their turn. However, this is a problem of the player, not the game. Do not play with people not suited to analytical planning games (especially indecisive players OR minutae maximizers) - you will surely exceed the 90-120 minutes Java is rated at. With the right crowd, this is an excellent game. Final kicker - this is one of the best-produced, gorgeous Eurogames I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Highly recommended for lovers of complex, thoughtful strategy games. *** UPDATE: Knocked Java down a peg for its brutal endgame, where the last player to go (particularly in a 4P game) has a hell of a job to do. Now, this wouldn't normally concern me, especially since Java provides perfect vision and the player to the right of the potential game ender can see it coming and should be able to prepare for it. (Heck, if I was to the left of the leader I'd try to be the game ender to have a chance to catch up.) It's not a flaw in my mind - it just makes a difficult (but FUN) 4P Java game that much harder and inaccessible, as your long-term strategy NEEDS to account for your position in the Final Count when you see it coming.

Tikalt és a Torrest is nagyon szeretem. Mivel ez a kettő szerelemgyerekének tűnt, ezért nagyon érdekelt. Ráadásul a Taluva is nagy kedvenc, amire szintén hasonlít így úgy tűnt semmi se állhat az útjába. Hát egyáltalán nem váltotta be a hozzáfűzött reményeket az első két fős party. Elvileg elég sok akció közül választhatunk, de szinte minden kör a 2 kártya, 2 lapka, 1 építés +1 valami bűvkörben telt. Igazából nem is nagyon látok okot arra, hogy innen kimozduljon az ember. Pedig amúgy nagyon hangulatos, ötletes, egyedi játék lenne a gyönyörű nagy 3d-s, folyamatosan épülő, térképpel. De valahogy a kezdeti tapogatózások után unalomba fulladt a dolog, annyira straightforwardnak tűnt minden akció. Elgondolkodtam rajta, hogy vajon több játékossal jobb lenne-e, de max. a licit része válna érdekesebbé, és kiszámíthatatlanabba, de nem hiszem, hogy nagyon érdemes lenne változtatni a fenti "beégetett" stratégián. Azért lehet, hogy kap még egy esélyt, hátha...

Another excellent Kramer/Kiesling. Feels similar to Tikal in many respects, but adds another dimension (literally). End game scoring seems to be even more important than in Tikal. The board at the end of the game looks stunning. Java is certainly no fast game, but I haven't experienced the AP problems so many seem to be upset about, yet. It is true that the festivals do seem a bit tacked on, though.

Java is quite an intriguing game and I get as much enjoyment out of it as I do any of the other games in the Mask trilogy. I might actually like it a shade more than some of the others due to the heavy 3D aspect. Game-play feels somewhat similar with the Action Point system (although it feels very much like its own game) but the spatial element and very tight, tactical game-play is deep and engaging.  That being  said, this one is probably best with fewer players as AP can really bog down the game and the game almost can't play without a certain level of over-analysis. In that, it isn't as pleasant as the other games in this series.  Also, the end-game scoring is so top-heavy when it comes to its influence on the final score that it sort of makes the mid-game scoring feel less significant.  These pesky little things aside, I look forward to when this is back in print!

This game has a lot going for it.  Numerous paths to victory.  Beuatiful pieces.  Lots to think about.  Wily tile placement.  

The board can rapidly change, which keeps things lively, but also can dramatically impact down-time, as each player at the beginning of their turn needs to think a bit more about what they need to do.  

Lots of opportunities for WOW! moves.  Those moments in a game when something truly amazing falls into place for a player.

My dream would be to see someone create an AI program for this game.  I believe it would be more complex than Go.

The game componets are very well made and this game looks great to boot. There are so many things that you want to do, but are only allowed 6ap per turn. Lots of tough decisions to make with plenty of strategy and tactics. This is definitely a thinking man's/woman's game. I can surely see there being problems with AP amongst the players. Especially in the final rounds of the game. There is just so much to look at and try to plan for that you get lost in your thoughts.

My thoughts? Well, it's a really nicely designed game. Surely the heaviest of the 3 in the series, but I still had fun playing it. I don't know how often I will play it, as it can be a brain burner and I would have to find the right people to play it with. But with the right people it could be a very enjoyable experience. Be warned though, it can almost feel like a chess match at times.

Java is a very challenging game, more cerebral and taxing than Tikal.  Tikal focused on longer-term strategic decisions, whereas Java is very tactical and emphasizes finding the "clever move." Java is also much more chaotic because of the constantly changing board and the more mobile explorers.  Several years later, I'm still not sure which is the deeper game.  If I could only play one of the two I would choose Tikal, but I enjoy both games a great deal.

Be warned that there are almost limitless moves for the anally retentive to consider during their turns, so if you experienced problems with downtime in Tikal, it will probably be even worse with Java.

Four plays, once with four and three times with three. An intense brain-burner that I enjoy a great deal, but the playing conditions need to be just right. I much preferred the three-player game to the four-player game because of the increased breathing room and decreased down time. It's also important to have opponents who can think spatially and who are able to take their turns in a reasonable amount of time. You just can't bring it out around people who are going to spend several minutes per turn searching the board to see if they can find two extra points.

It's also the best-looking game in my collection, for sure.

I should try it out with two one of these days.

Havn't played it for yeeeears, but even today, it's a nice game with just one problem, the downtime.

Everything works and is fun, aswell as interactive and all, but since everything can change in a single turn, you cannot think ahead much, if at all (talking about the time aspect only, it's still a strategic/tactical game). This increases the downtime by a great amount, sadly.

Would definitely rate it a bit higher without the downtime. I like Tikal and Mexica more anyway.

Java, in short, is the *complex* member of the [family=40][/family]. This means that the fundamentals are there: action points, strong spatiality, player interaction in the form of collective and collusive development, and a sand-box space that welcomes creativity (and creative dickery).

Java stands out with respect to its siblings [thing=54][/thing], [thing=2955][/thing], and [thing=88][/thing] (the unacknowledged fourth member of the trilogy) in a few distinct ways:

First, in terms of player interaction it stands somewhere between Tikal's "cutting through the brush to get there faster" (i.e., path-optimization/timing) and Mexica's "Moats, walls, men, and other things that stand in your way" (i.e., flat-out-boxing people into or out of spaces) -- Java is perhaps like Torres in that there are possibilities to make life difficult for other players by making them use their ever shrinking supply of special resources (i.e., in Torres, at high level play, it becomes a game of cutting away at your opponents special abilities and making them regret not having the ones that they have already used) . This complements perfectly Java's hilly aesthetic -- you are not putting up walls, but rather differentially inclining the slope of the hill, requiring players to go about it otherwise, differently, still cursing your name.

Second, Java has a mini trick taking game that adds an element of card play. As the gods are fickle in the Javanese region (i.e., the suit is random, as are the cards), this introduces a thematic yet welcome and fresh bit of randomness in a game that would otherwise be wholly spatial reasoning. As this is the most complex of the four games within the Mask Trilogy, not because more complex rules, but because the effects of your actions are far more non-linear and holds the most creative possibilities (i.e., AP players beware!). This not only adds a great tug-of-war for card possession, but the card play itself allows for small surprises (e.g., some cards have two symbols on them, so while cards are *usually* worth one towards the trick, sometimes they are worth 2). A likely intended result of this is that, of the six action points available to you, you are often likely to be only using 4 or 5 in order to draw one or two cards at the end -- this alleviates a bit of analytical stress for players and keeps the game moving. This welcome addition is also a fantastic counter-point to the immediate tactical scoring and end-game scoring by providing resources for something that is somewhere in between.

Lastly, Java with its rice paddies, villages, and palaces is the most beautiful of the four (yes, even with the all-too-beautiful Mexica reprint). The thick tiles that lay on top of one another with their rich yet unobtrusive hues create this beautiful space to navigate. I've repeatedly found myself not wanting to put the game away as the result of play creates a gorgeous but different landscape every time.

----------------------------------------------------
Update January 2016
I love Java with 2, but with 3, it is sublime. A third player makes the texture of the game more nuanced and brings in the possibility of reigning in a winner through literally co-hosting palace parties (as well as building collaboratively away from a potential winner).

The "build up and climb" board placement is fun. The card play is strange. The card aspect may be a little too simplistic...? Not sure. There are some serious screw your neighbor aspects in the game that you need to play carefully to avoid. I imagine the analysis issue inherent in action point games can crop its head here, but it wasn't a problem in my one game. I'd like to play it again.

I really enjoyed this game. The vertical element of tile laying makes this games very unique. A couple of the guys felt it was too puzzle-like. I liked that aspect of it. There are some similarities to Tikal, the only other of this "series" that I've played, but in some ways I like this one more.

I think this is the best of the mask trilogy of games, despite the analysis factor there are a lot of good options almost every turn, and lots of possible strategies to accumulate points.

Add the structure and building into the lot, and it makes for a more interesting game than Tikal, and a better game than Mexica.

   I absolutely love this game.  I have heard the comments about the down time being huge, but with the one group I play this with, we are all very consciencious of eachother, and don't let our turns drag on too much.  However When I sit down to play with a heavy strategic player I still don't find them bothersome because I am always planning my next move while they are playing.  I know it's listed as a 4 player game and I have optimal max players listed as five, and that's because  a friend of mine showed us that with a few pieces from Tikal, and a little ingenuity this can be a fine 5 player game.

This is a beautiful game!  I love the 3-D effect, and the rich colors.  My only critisizm is that the endgame can outdo the rest of the game.  It feels like the festivals should be played for full points to spice up the mid-game and diminish the end player advantage.  Unfortunately, I have only been able to play it a half-dozen times, due to a lack of players for the time and strategy it needs.

Bigger, meatier brother of Tikal. With so little luck and so much to analyze, I see how the game can be a disaster with certain groups. Fortunately for me, the people I play with do not suffer from AP, so a game of this takes a little over an hour.

I really like the beautiful, classy art. It makes most other games look ugly. A pity that the cards are so flimsy.

Played this two-handed solo to get the rules down. It's much lighter than I was expecting; there's really not all that much going on. I have no idea why it's a 3.4 in weight. It's more like a 2.8 or so.

The core game play is very tactical, very "eye-for-an-eye". This is an area majority game with tile placement, some blocking, and some auctioning. The real meat of the game is in the tile placement and blocking although all the pieces do fit nicely together. It's a weird game. Not one of my favorites, but glad I tried it. Definitely seems like it'd be best with 3

Best with 3 and good with 2-4

RATING: 8
This is an entertaining mix of the mechanics of Taluva and Tikal, although Taluva came out much later. It is clearly a Wolfgang Kramer through and through with action points, AP menu of stuff to do, and domination of key VP generators (the temples). The board starts out empty, but expands outward horizontally, as well as build up vertically, much like the monuments in Tikal, or the castles in Torres. The visual appeal of this game is striking, and quite pleasing in the end-game. There is the usual Krameresque "some many options, so little action points" dilemmas and plenty of tension with the player interactions; one cannot play solitaire in this game, as there is always someone, or several players, meddling in your affairs--you build a VP generator, and someone will promptly upgrade it and dominate it, unless you have anticipated with defensive tactical play. In this term, it is more of a tactical game than a strategic one. Still, an excellent game, that plays reasonably well in 90-120 minutes. As for the analysis-paralysis, this did not manifest itself as badly as others have said; it is probably up there with Tikal in terms of AP, but bearable, and the payoff is well worth it.

The game was ok, but a little slow and hard to understand what was happening.  My biggest beef with it is that it's remarkably easy for people to set up blocking screens with their pieces and never have to move them again.

I'm surprised I haven't seen more comparisons between this game and Taluva.  Not only do they use very similar components, but many of the rules are also the same--one tile can be laid on top of others, but not directly on top of another, and the height of the pile influences what can be placed there.  However, it's a longer game and the scoring is much more complex, adding a stronger element of planning.  This is tough for me, because it's ultimately likely that I'll be competing with the other players in multiple places and it gets quite difficult for me to read the board in each of those places and figure out exactly what people can and can't do to undo my moves. So on that level, it gets very frustrating.  But it's a very clever game for those who are able to process the board well. (1 play)

Java is a great addition to the Kramer AP system that follows relatively close to Tikal while departing in a slightly different direction to make it more gamey.  The 3D levels idea is very cool and makes gameplay highly tactical.  The balance between ways to score means the beginning is just as important as the middle as is the end.  I like to think of Java as Torres plus Tikal divided by math.  It is just as good as both without all the strenuous calculations.  -A truly great offering.

Update:  A few more plays later and I can definitely say this is my favorite Kramer design.  There's just such an elegance and richness to the gameplay that control feels tight yet free-form.  If anyone asks for a mask game, this will always be my preference.

Played twice with 4 players. Already having played Tikal, it was easy for me to grasp the concepts behind Java and digest the rules. Nevertheless, it soon became apparent that Java is quite a different game. I cannot yet judge whether it is as good a game as its sibling. On the plus side, the positions of each player's pieces change more dynamically in Java than in Tikal (where players often tend to focus on a particular region of the board). On the minus side, the victory in Java seems to be too heavily influenced by the scoring at the end of the game (which is determined to a significant extent by the last round of play).

Good tile-laying game but it's a bit dry.  I prefer this game to Tikal as this game is quicker.  For some reason, in our group, there's less analysis paralysis that goes on in this game compared to Tikal (maybe it's because you only get to spend 6 AP instead of 10?)  Very pretty to look at once the game is over.

This is Tikal's more complex brother and I liked it quite a lot.  It seems like you have more control and far more options for victory in this over its sibling.  While in each turn down to the very last the number of options open to you seem almost overwhelming, the game comes together so smoothly in the end that you feel rewarded for the tough choices.  I would echo the sentiments of many that this game is definitely not for playing with slow players or those with AP.

MMM....Java. Just the thought gets the creative juices flowing, in fact one of best games I have played that really rewards creativity in your strategy and allows you to pull off some really brilliant moves which is awesome. 

An optimization game at heart and a very good one at that with almost no luck at all. It seems it can be a little hard to catch the leader except maybe at the very end where lots of 'jockeying' for positions takes place. 

A very deep and high strategy 'Gamer game' so if that ain't your thing don't bother playing. Quite AP prone but still manages to move along most of the time with 3 or less but certain turns will bog down creating some downtime, this and Tikal do have the most AP. I do enjoy this one more with 3 players than Tikal and really think Mexica is the only one to go with for four (Tikal=2, Java=3, Mexica=4)

Enjoy this a lot. Straightforward with lots of options and a freeform approach to what order things can be done in (Reef Encounter style) which can be turned to your advantage. 

Was initially put off by lots of people quoting analysis Paralysis with this, but when I actually sat down to play it, was pleasantly surprised to find it it doesn't HAVE to rely on such a great deal of strategic complexity. Of course it's possible to sit and mull over your move for ever if you wanted to, yes, and you'd probably gain from in but there's obvious strategies at every turn, and it's no way a  massive brain burner unless you want it to be. 

Can come down to a very close finish - about 3 points in it after final scoring on my last game - especially if played with like-minded players. Lots of opportunity to screw over your opponents, block routes, steal/spoil prime irrigation spots, etc.

Only downside is that it's perhaps a little dry in play, but that really will depend on your group.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2013)

At last I got to play this fabled game. I was keen to try it because I really like Tikal. Unfortunately, our game experience wasn´t very good, on one hand the player who explained the rules made a mistake surrounding the lakes making the game very long and hard to finish, on the other hand, a player that felt attacked didn’t try to win the game, she only tried to damage a player leaving me an easy victory :(. So I don’t have yet a firm opinion on the game.

So far, I like the game components and the low luck involved with the cards. It seems that this is best with 3 players, with more the downtime can be long. The theme is very boring (for me). The game is very cerebral, not sure if this is deeper than Tikal, but the spatial factor in Java, makes it harder for me. 

For now I want to play the game again to form a better opinion.

For the longest time, Tikal had been the only game I had played from the mask trilogy and I was, at best, lukewarm about it. However, I still have all of the mask games and I intend to try them all before figuring out what to do with the set.

For my tastes, Java is head and shoulders better than Tikal. While key aspects of Tikal feel out of my control too much of the time, in Java I feel more like my decisions are paramount to my winning. This game is a puzzle to be sure and you do not want to play it with the slow and AP-prone. However, with a group of quick thinkers who simply find an opportunity and go for it without analyzing EVERY opportunity multiple ways, this is clear winner. At the end of the game, you will have a beautiful Javanese sculpture on your table to rival what any game can produce. Excellent and satisfying on many levels.

I'm a huge fan of Java's older and more popular sibling, Tikal. I think my long-standing appreciation for Tikal may interfere with my perspective on Java, and probably on Mexica as well. The trilogy presents a Goldi-locks dilemma of sorts, with Java one one end of the spectrum (too hot) and Mexica on the other (too cold). If you haven't played any of them, try Tikal.

As for Java itself, I found the game's reputation as a massive brain-burner to be undeserved. My guess is that the permutations available to any player on his or her turn were various enough that I didn't bother trying to delimit or assess them. I looked for a good move, spent a moment refining it, and executed it. We played a two-hour game with four players, including a 30 minute rules explanation. One issue with Java is that the game-state changes so rapidly that there's little reason to pay much attention when it's not your turn.

Neither Java nor Mexica tops Tikal.

This is the most tactical of the Kramer/Kiesling games in the series.  It is the weakest - but the whole trio is terrific.  Once you play it enough to not have to over-think each move, you'll come to enjoy the stark originality of the way the tile laying and piece moving works in the battle to be king of the hill.

I can see how some people would really enjoy this game, but I think it's just not for me.  There is just too much downtime - I think that there is probably a lot to think about, but I'm not willing to invest a lot of thought in my move, and don't necessarily have the patience to wait for players that try to figure out the optimal play.  I don't mind the pasted on theme, but it's hard for me to feel engaged when the game lasts considerably longer than I think it should take.  At 45 minutes my rating would go up considerably, but here it just feels a little bloated.

RATING: 6
Heavy tile-placement game with a 3D angle to consider. Seriously, the one thing which really strikes me about this game is how "pretty" it is. Especially at end game. The gameplay itself is fairly elegant, but very thought-intensive. And since you can't plan your moves ahead until everyone else is done, there's a huge downtime between turns (approx. 3 to 4 mins per player).

Cool game, it feels very open and there are lots of different strategies you could pursue. It seems to scale perfectly from 2-4 players (even the "auction" is just as good with two).

I can see how many people would complain that it is too prone to analysis paralysis (there is a LOT to think about) but I guess it just comes down to playing it with the right group. Personally I'm happy to make a move without having analysed every eventuality so this kind of game doesn't pose a problem to me.

A good game, but I'd hoped for more. You're moving your guys on Java's landscape and raising it up as you build and expand villages, trying to get the highest spot in a village so you can score it. It's obviously related to Torres, but Torres is a better, deeper and more exciting game in my opinion.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My personal least favorite of the series. This one is a puzzle-like game of putting series of city spaces together and manipulating hex shapes. A slow first half followed by a suddenly more complex second half as room starts running out and options are less. Can be fun and I have to admit I liked the India theme (something not seen often) but I felt like I was playing an advanced kids game--not what I expected when compared with Mexica and Tikal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initial thoughts: Java invokes serious AP from start to finish, making it considerably longer than Tikal, which has the AP factor kicking in only in the last few turns. Other than that, I think this could be my favorite of the Mask Trilogy, need to play more to verify.

Yawn. I just can't get into this game. I want to like it, but it bores me. Long downtime. I finally get to my turn and don't really care what I do...I don't feel a part of the game. I don't feel like I'm playing other players either. It's like playing a computer game. I only give it as high as a 5 because it is at least open-ended and gives you plenty of choices.

Java is a good game; it's definitely better than Mexica but not as good as Tikal is. BUT (and this is a big BUT for me) it's too long - even with non-AP-gamers - compared to what it is. And I think this one is a bit too abstract for my taste. So, in Mask-trilogy, Tikal is a favorite of mine, but even that there are some minor issues...

RATING: 7.5
[2007.Jan.03] One of the "Mask Trilogy" action point games by veteran designers Kiesling & Kramer; the others being Mexica and Tikal. The heaviest of the three, this is a nice meaty game for those who enjoy sitting down for a serious mental meal. Not only is the game a mental work-out, but the game pieces are quite impressive too! If making your brain sweat appeals to you, then take a journey to Java. You'll be glad you did. {7}

Very dry and abstract game. The game play at the beginning of the game is completely different than the gameplay at the end.

The game is dragging like crazy at the end, while at the beginning, there is virtually little competition.

If you like the hex puzzle system, go with Taluva, I did not play it, but it play most efficiently and quickly. Also you can kill opposing units in the way, which should make it more fun.

I really enjoy this game and the spatial aspect of building tiles/mountains competing for high value palaces and trying to encircle large lakes in the early game.  This is definitely my favorite of Kramer's action point games although it is also the one that likely will result in quite a bit of AP moments.  Men are used to claim palaces, participate in the weird party mechanism with card sets, and potentially block access or ability to build.

Comparisons have been made between Java and Tikal and arguments abound as to which is better, but my summation is this - they're different enough to warrant playing on their own, and similar enough that if you know how to play one, you can play the other. Java is slightly more complex in strategy.

Java appears to be the love child of Tikal and Taluva (and yes I know that Taluva was released after Java). The similarities to Taluva include the 3-hex pieces and the ability to stack pieces for a 3D board. As for similarities to Tikal, there is the exploration theme and the action point system. I like Taluva quite a bit. Tikal, on the other hand, is a good game that suffers from downtime and analysis paralysis. As such, I tend to play Tikal online if possible.

Similarities aside, Java is its own game because it adds odd scoring systems, which didn't click with me. As such, I spent most of the game trying to remember how/why to score and falling behind.

There are two other problems. First, the action point system is a neat idea, but only works well in PBEM games. The number of possible actions are endless, which lead to the "redos". You figure out the first 5/6 actions, but then change your mind and need to reset the board back to where you started. I am as guilty of this as the next person, but I still find it annoying. Computers handle this issue much better by having an "undo" feature. 

The second problem is the board. Don't get me wrong, the board looks nice and is functional. The problem has to do the borders. Java is largely a tile-laying game so relies on the ability to place tiles well. Near the end of the game, space is limited making it difficult to lay the 3-hex pieces. As the 3-hex pieces are the game's timer, this delays the endgame longer than it should. 

In short, I would rather play Taluva which doesn't suffer from these issues.

[u]Result[/u]: An interesting game that I would try again, but have no real desire to do so soon.

I think this game is very clever and interesting; however, it is a bit too much of a gamer's game.  Six actions each turn and lots of choices can slow down the game too much.  How high things are and which pieces are on top of each other are difficult to see as well, it would have been nice if they made it thicker and colored the sides with different colors.  Overall, a good game though.

This game actually took me by surprise.  While there are some aspects of the game that could use a little more explaining, I thought it worked well.  It was a lot of fun and the game can be shortened by simply removing some tiles so the game ends quicker.  You can run into &quot;analysis paralysis&quot; in this game though.  Much to keep up with after the first 2 turns, but still an interesting game by far.

Deeper than Tikal or Mexica, a great game that must be played with others who like this type of game.  Unfortunately, that wasn't my family.  My youngest son's strategy was to use up his action points placing as many 3 field tiles as possible to make the game come to an early end.

Compared to Tikal, 3-dimensional tile laying adds depth, reduced AP(10 to 6) requires more optimizing turn process. Ever-changing gameboard requires tatical play more than strategic play.

At the end of game I am always impressed by beauty of gameboard.

Gorgeous game, but the epitome of analyis paralysis and turn optimization.  Also, can be a bit fiddly ascertaining legal placements (tiles must not exactly overlap, and this is not always easy to discern).  

The thickest tiles and probably the nicest components I've ever had the joy of owning, but the HEAVY box cost me a pile to ship when I sold it.

Rating based on 4 players.

This is an interesting game that's a good blend of area control, tile placement, and logistical movement. I enjoy how the landscape changes over the game (unlike Mexica, say) and how this leads to situations of direct conflict as you block others and break up cities. As with the other games in the K&K mask trilogy, you must make clever use of your action points and puzzling your way out can be a brainburner... however, this leads to the main drawback of the game: it is extremely AP-prone, and it's probably at its worst when at the 4-player count because at that point the game becomes almost purely tactical and you cannot plan ahead. The downtime is pretty heavy in this game.

I'm undecided whether the festival cards add a much needed dose of luck to an otherwise perfect-information, calculable game... or if it adds unnecessary randomness to a game that should reward only careful thought. However, I'm leaning toward the former, as even the randomness can be lessened with careful timing.

This is a good game that I think I'd rate higher at a lower player count (I wouldn't want to play this with 4 players again). Overall, I'd rate the Mask trilogy games as Tikal > Java > Mexica.

I appreciate the choices that are offered to you at your turn.  Having 3 extra turn token is a nice bonus for those hard decisions.  Play this game with confidence that it's a deeply tactical exercise with many ways to achieve your goal.

With less action points per turn than Tikal, this game makes every action that much more important. Being able to really see how your actions and your opponents will affect the end scoring, as well as making moves that will score in the here and now is a very important trait.

Beautiful looking game.I like this game better than Tikal. Action point system works quite good (although you always would like to have at least one action point more...). Works quite good with 2 players as well!

NL: Goed spel uit de "face"reeks van de heren Kramer en Kiesling. Ik vind de beste van deze 3 mooie spellen. Speel het veel te weinig.

2nd & Most AP game from the "jungle civ building" trilogy. Festival card play seems tacked on, and final moves are a true AP grind... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A beautiful game of laying tiles and moving pawns - with the uncommonly used (in board game terms) third dimension (height) adding not only to the game's beauty but also greatly to the spatial challenge it presents to its players! Don't get this if you don't like abstract spatial and somewhat opaque games

I can see the criticism regarding AP for this game (and by extension the other games in the Mask trilogy for using the same action point allowance system), but it didn't detract for me. I've recently had an upswing in my interest in Go, and while the games are obviously very different I still feel they share several qualities. Positioning, give and take etc etc. Primarily, it is also a game that rewards heuristics and intuition as opposed to calculation, the latter will very much burn you out (mentally) and will have you min-max each turn without sufficient consideration of the endgame positioning.

So where does that leave Java? Well it's a great abstract game - very dry but still tense and very interesting - it allows you to be creative and feel very clever as you plop down the tiles. The added element of the cards also keep it from bogging down too much in the spatial puzzle, it adds a layer of tension and uncertainty that is in no way dominating - but a welcome side-dish so to speak. Also, I suspect that the game rewards playing it more aggressively, by targeting your opponents position, more than playing just to optimise for yourself - adding a lovely combative streak to the game (thought time will tell if this is indeed the case). So the only question that remains is - Will I get to play it enough, and with people who enjoy it in the same way? I hope so!

A great game!

Wonderful game. Tons of tough decisions.  Tension is high and because good options abound, one can never be certain what the next player will do or whether he'll steal your move.  Turn angst keeps me excited the whole game, even during the down time.  Analysis paralysis?  Yeah, I tend to see people labor over their final turns.  Just the same, I always look forward to my next session.

Defines AP, yet when looking at everything after the game, I'm not sure that there is much control over the outcome. It is too easy to steal another player's city by adding to its height, and almost impossible to set yourself up such that your possition is unassailable. Also I'm not a big fan of the endgame condition, it is too difficult to predict/guess at when it may get triggered

A well designed and produced game.  One of the longer euros (2hrs maybe for a first game).

Uses extra thick tiles and the action point system.  Quite tactical (and prone to AP) with the possibility of executing some dramatic moves in a single turn.  

Plays like an abstract and is quite different from many other Eurogames, and the graphics really compliment the theme.  Just not a game that I overly enjoyed.

A very tactical area majority game that I don't fully enjoy. It plays a bit better with three than two, though with three you have to wait even longer for your turn, and waiting is a serious issue with this game.

Strangely enough, [i]Java[/i] reminds me alot of [i]Scrabble[/i]: there's not much use in planning your next move because the best moves are pretty obvious and they'll be gone by the time it's your turn again. On the bright side, the board and pieces are fairly attractive, the rules are well written, and the three-dimensional tile-placing aspect of the game is very appealing. [4 plays; gave away]

Java was sadly just about what you'd expect from "a combination of Tikal and Torres." The constantly evolving board is beautiful, and the rules really are not that terribly hard to understand. However, the game is almost 100% tactical, and the constantly changing board means that you cannot really plan out your turn until it's actually your turn. Add to this the many options available to and the clear, calculated effects of each action, and you've got rather lengthy "Wait, what if I go here instead..." turns, totally fascinating when you're up but a complete drag when you're waiting for your opponents. While the added complexity here is somewhat interesting, I can't say it really pulled me in more than Tikal does, which I rate the same. My rating could increase if the two player game works and is faster.

Well, after owning this for a couple of years I finally got around to playing it and I wasn't disappointed.  It's a wonderfully pleasing game, both aesthetically and to play.  Lots of choices, plenty of variation of scoring, hidden depth and, I'm sure, loads of reply value.  Plus it's great to handle and look at.  Rating may well go up with more plays. Only downside is that it could easily suffer from AP if taken too seriously.

This is an OK game.  But I much prefer Tikal to this game.  Tikal's theme and theme integration is better.  As is the overall game flow/mechanics.  Now I may be biased since I've played Tikal a half dozen times or so and own it, but I don't care to play this game again.

Given the rules, Java is a seemingly simple game. Use actions to place three kinds of tiles (water, fields and villages) to maximize areas and build bigger (and higher scoring) temples. The tricky part is that tiles can overlap each other, something that drastically changes the board and may cause analysis paralysis. The game doesn't always feel streamlined, like the scoring for surrounding water (something that depletes the water tiles already in the opening) and the "partys" (arrange parties where everybody in the village can participate, but usually there is only one player anyway). Still, it's an entertaining game.

RATING: 7.5
Update: second play was much better, raised the rating from 6 to 7. I had a wrong idea about the pace of the game-play. Tikal allows players to react before scoring, which is quite generous compared to Java. With Java, there is no separate scoring round and therefore you continuously have to try to score during every turn. Once I got this difference worked out, it made much more sense.

After playing Tikal, my expectation for this game was really high because everyone said this one is much deeper. Now that I have played Java, and I prefer the simplicity of Tikal. It feels like Java has too many things scattered around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Like Tikal, Mexica, and Torres, this is a puzzle-ish affair in which efficiency and thorough analysis are immensely important.  Unlike those other games, it can easily consume about two hours, and its transparent theme and limited options start to wear out their welcome before that much time has elapsed.  Java is not a bad game by any means, but it is definitely my least favorite of the Kramer/Kiesling "action point" series.  For a game that has similar concepts but a more agreeable duration, try Torres.

RATING: 7
Probably the easiest of the 'Mask Trilogy' for a variety of reasons. For one, this series of games championed Action Point Allowance systems and Java is the simplest; all actions cost 1 point or are free. For another, play is not bounded by specific areas, but rather the shape of the pieces available, which gives Java a much more free-form play, where one's actions are mostly limited by one's imagination.

As with the others in the Trilogy, Java has an attractive board and tiles, but boring player pieces in an ugly selection of colors.

this is much more analytical than its relative Tikal and therefore even more AP prone. many more options, which in my opinion makes it a better game, since it rewards creativity. people who like fast play should avoid this. 3 player game can easily take 3-4 hours.

Java is an excellent action-point allocation game. You only have 6 action points but you can do just enough with them. Game mechanics don't really limit your options at all. With some players the game might really slow down as there are so many ways of accomplishing things. I like how there is room for clever moves and I really liked the 3D aspect of laying tiles and resolving majorities. It's not a totally perfect information game (I count this as a plus) because of cards you need for festivals but basically there isn't much of a luck involved in the game. Only thing that comes close is the timing for final scoring since the one who is last at that seems to have weakest position to score big points in it (especially if there are 4 players). 

Only played with 3 players and it is really good that way. Probably works very well with 4 too.

JAVA - Meccaniche semplici, malgrado al primo ascolto le spiegazioni possano sembrare fumose (anche perché la traduzione in italiano è pessima).
Tra i pregi il fatto che tutte le mosse vengono illustrate con tessere a simboli (ininfluente quindi la conoscenza della lingua). Il gioco però stanca a causa di pause lunghe dovute alle fasi di gioco degli altri giocatori.
Ogni partecipante infatti ha a disposzione 6 'mosse' che immobilizzano il gioco agli altri rendendo quelle pause alla fine noiose. 
L'interazione è molto elevata ma rende addirittura impossibile programmare una strategia e ci si trova ad ogni turno costretti a rivedere i propri piani.
La prima partita non mi ha entusiasmato, ma sarebbe giusto dargli una seconda opportunità.

Every turn is a brand new tactical challenge to solve - how can I maximise my score this turn given the state of the board ... but with the secondary consideration of minimising the other players’ opportunities for the next turn. 

Then, two thirds through, with the final scoring expected to double your points, tactical attention turns to locking down highest position in the cities so they can’t be stolen. Usually easier said then done. 

Throw in analytical gamers and one of the broadest decision trees in gaming (6 action points, multi-dimensional, multi-size placement) and each turn becomes a titanic logic puzzle. No surprise that this can turn out longish. For me, sometimes there’s no downtime as I’m continually evaluating possibilities. Other times, when I’ve quickly worked out my next options and am confident no one will be playing there, it’s pure downtime. It can be accentuated when all the players are concentrating in the same area of the board where the most points are up for development, so you have a completely new problem to solve by the time it’s your turn, making much of your pre-turn analysis throw-away. The downtime is compensated for by the continual puzzle challenges. 

It may not get played as frequently as other 8’s out there due to its intensity but it’s certainly one of the most attractive games I’ve played and that earnt it an extra rating point.

I've heard a lot of people say that this game is like a more-involved Tikal, but I don't think the games are that similar, and I vastly prefer this one.  In Java, you're trying to form larger and larger cities by placing three-hex terrain tiles (which can go next to or on top of other tiles), and then take control of those cities for end-game scoring.  Unlike Tikal, there's no random element--all the tiles are the same.  I really enjoyed the mental puzzle of figuring out how best to place the tiles so that I could score the most points.  Though Java is the earlier title, I'd say that this game is really a lot like Taluva, but with more complexity.

It's certainly a matter of tast. I give it an 8.

A great near-zero-luck brain burner in the family of Mexica, Tikal, and Torres. I said near-zero-luck because a negligible amount of luck is present due to the Festival cards.  Java is clearly the heaviest in the series and more prone to analysis/paralysis. It shares many elements with the other games in the family: it uses the action point system, tile laying (similar to Tikal,) and factoring in the vertical height (like Torres).

Java is somewhat Chess-like in the sense that one needs to visually analyze a constantly changing board to find a good move (if not the best move,) among a large number of possibilities, while a move itself is composed of several actions. This requires processing a lot of information and also requires look-ahead and anticipation of opponent's moves. The game is also very tactical since the landscape of the board changes radically between turns. This is more so with more players. It is probably best with 3 and too chaotic with 4.

Java is a fantastic game and a feast for the lovers of heavy brain burner abstract strategy games. However, it may turn out to be more of a chore than fun for most others. So, I suggest playing those other games in the series first, and if you still need more challenge, then try Java.

With four players, the board seems too large and the game takes too long. If we would cut the board size and number of tiles by about 1/3rd it would be fun. The general idea of the game is you are placing tiles on the board or on top of other tiles. You get 6 action points to spend, and you can create cities by connecting village hexes and then spending an action point to announce the city by placing the city tile that matches the size. You get some points for this, and some points at the end for having one of your markers at the highest elevation in that city. Through clever tile placements you can carve big cities up and make new ones, but you can never join two cities. All this sounds well and good, but the board is so large and there are so many places to place and things to consider that it really locks up AP prone players. The board state changes so much that you can't really plan your turn until it's on your turn, which makes the wait for the AP players unbearable. The game also has this strange, tacked on mini-game where you can play matchy-matchy cards for extra points in a city you have a guy in. All in all, while I wanted to like this, I just don't think it holds up.

This is the game for which the term "analysis paralysis" was probably coined. It is a game of great depth that can be utterly unforgiving to the casual player. While the game is fun and exciting, the problem is simply that it is too easy to make mistakes, setting up huge scores for your opponents.

This game has a reputation for being totally AP inducing.  After playing it, I can see how it earns that reputation.  On any given turn the decision tree is huge, and you can't plan ahead because other players will probably interfere with any plans you try to hatch in advance.  That said, I've had a lot of fun playing this game with people that generally know how to keep a game moving.

RATING: 5
UPDATE: Downgraded from 8 to 5. Strategically a bit stale once people have figured out the game: Start with water tiles, then do as many festivals as possible, then take over other players' cities for end-game scoring.

Too annoyingly tactical. Yes, half your points come from end-game scoring, but where does the other half come from?

So players only focus on the end-game when there aren't any other points to score available.

UPDATE: This game is NASTY! Pure EVIL! You can do horrible things to your opponent and suck away points from them!

Tentative 8 after one two player game. Gorgeous game. I can't believe my dad put up with this game (he couldn't care less for Attika). Smoother game play than Torres because of the larger board and more flexible building rules. More interactive than Torres; it's easier to "invade" cities in Java than castles in Torres. Ironically, less calculating than Mexica (no need to create areas of a specific size). Didn't have a problem with the "spatial" element--you're basically playing only one kind of tile on the board. The festival mechanism does feel tacked on, though.

Java is very much like Mexica in several ways: the board starts out empty, players make moves using action points that can benefit other players as well as themselves, the board gradually fills up with features, travel from place to place gradually becomes easier and easier yet there are still roadblocks, the number of potential moves available to a player grows exponentially (with a large exponent) until it is very quickly impossible to consider them all, the best move in a given situation is very difficult to determine and depends on what the other players are going to do, and there are several ways to score points which halfway correspond and halfway conflict.  I like games of nearly infinite complexity, even if new players are completely befuddled on the first few moves (a feeling I dislike having even temporarily, and Java gave me in spades).  A few flaws in Java: scoring for irrigation became a slightly more complex game of "Dots and Boxes" which is really not much of a game, scoring for festivals became mostly a trick of doing it solo rather than competing as described in the rules (only happened once in the whole game), and the final scoring round seemed to favor the player who moved last far more than it should.  Overall, an interesting game that I may rate higher after more plays.

I enjoyed this game.  Simple options, but complex execution.  Didn't bog down too much with AP and optimization the first play, but there was noticeable downtime between turns.  Still, it was something I look forward to playing again.  The risk of AP-heavy micro-optimization each turn does decrease the overall game experience, otherwise I'd probably rate this game even higher.

This really is Torres meets Tikal. There is quite a lot to like here - the way the board grows and the pieces move is all neat.  The trouble is that it is very opaque: even movement paths are not that clear, and the possible plays on a turn are astronomical. Not so big a deal for most of the game, but the end game could easily bog down to agony. I am not sure that the card plays and festivals add much.

The second game in the Mask Trilogy (along with [gameid=54] and [gameid=2955]) created by Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling.

In Java, players try to develop the rich and fertile central region, bringing culture and cultivating rice fields while building villages, cities, and palaces.

Will probably want to play Tikal over Java as the choices are a bit simpler and Tikal is more appealing and enjoyable.

If it could be played in 90 minutes or less, would be more enjoyable.

--Feb2008-- Quite amusing action point game.  There are lots of ways to score, to prevent an opponent from scoring, and to set yourself up for some future action.

[b]Caveat:[/b] I’ve only played this as a 2-player game, my :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown: are based on that.

:thumbsup: A lot of comments (and reviews) mention this as the heaviest game in the [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/40/mask-trilogy]Mask Trilogy[/url]. That has kept my from playing for quite a while, as I bought Java based on my love for [thing=54][/thing] and was fearful of a bad experience. It was Rahdo's [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5vlNVDI35M&t=1521s]playthrough video[/url] which showed me my fears were ungrounded and finally got me playing. And I didn't find Java to be too heavy at all.
:thumbsup: The action summary soon suffices as a reminder of how a turn flows. The rules are easily memorized, so you can get to the tactical nitty gritty of jockying for position and developing the board in the most beneficial way. There's tremendous replayability in this game.
:thumbsup: The tiles are made of very thick, very sturdy, glossy, nice feeling cardboard. They're used in a very clever way, both for visual appeal and in an interesting tactical puzzle. 

----

:thumbsdown: AP lurks around every corner in this game. Even with just six action points, it's sometimes hard to keep track of them*, and there's a lot of room for backtracking your moves. I haven't played with an AP-prone player yet, but still have experience moments were we had to back-track our actions. Right now, I can't plan my own turn during my opponent's as I need to assist him in playing correctly and keeping track of his action points. And vice versa... so maybe the players are more to blame than the game is.






*I'm thinking about adding a few additional cubes or chits to this game and Tikal, to pass around between players in order to keep track of spent action points.

With even more options for each player per turn than Tikal the game is in that category of games where the player who spends the most time thinking about their turn is most likely to win - to the detriment of player fun - oh, the downtime. I don't like egg-timers because I prefer to look at the aggregate time. What seems like a better option is four stopwatches, 20 minutes per experienced player, a ten point penalty for each extra minute, (party card playing doesn't count towards time). Or just play the game with three who like to see the pace move along.

Less random than Tikal, more random than Mexica.  Somehow not as good as either - I think players' options become too limited too early in the game.  6/10 is provisional, though - I've only played three times.  Not getting better with repetion, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In Tikal the decision space starts out narrow and widens as you add more workers and tiles to explore until it reaches its zenith in the end game. Java's decision space starts out as wide or wider than Tikal's final state and remains pretty much constant throughout due to its vertical placement options. And, finally, Mexica's decision space starts out wide open and slowly narrows as more and more of the board becomes sectioned off by canals and locked down into districts. Looking at the series in this way, you can begin to see why people may suggest that Java would be the most AP prone of the lot: in Tikal, AP potential appears to rise as the number of options available rises due to increases in the number of workers and cleared jungle tiles; in Java, it starts high and remains fairly constant from beginning to end; and, in Mexica, it seems to slowly decrease, but never disappear, as the game wears on. So, all that said, in considering whether or not to purchase Java - if you've experience playing Tikal - you might think about how Tikal feels to you in its final few turns and then imagine starting at that point and stretching it out for maybe as much as two hours. That would be something like how it feels to play Java. I like it quite a bit.

I used to like this quite a bit, though I just played it again recenty and noticed that there's a heck of a lot of downtime when it's not your turn, and it's not very conducive to socialization during the downtime, either.

Tile-laying in 3-D.  I was really surprise at how much I ended up liking this game.  As usual with action point games, there are often tough choices in what you are allowed to do.  In addition, adding the third dimension in play makes things even more brain-burning.  So far, I have played with two and three, each of which felt like a completely different game.  I would imagine the same with four.  The rating does suffer a little from the thought-provoking play: each time I have  played, I was mentally exhausted and needed some time off before playing again.  Otherwise, I would probably rate this higher.

Java ways heavily on the gaming table! It is the great grand-daddy of action-optimization and its attraction derives from its classic, yet engaging composition of three-dimensional tile-laying and area majority. It can certainly slow down with an analytic player but offers the best flavors of euro-gaming.

[1 play] I think this is by far the most difficult of the K&K mask series. The most gamey, brain-burning, and AP prone game I've played in quite a while. I really didn't grasp any decent long term strategy until it was way too late in our learning game.

Typically great production values and a simply gorgeous game too look at. I would never recommend this game to anyone that isn't an experienced gamer - his head would blow up like in Scanners.

Most recent play 4-26-09 with Michael, Corey, and Garrett at Net Lake.

RATING: 6.75
The 2nd of the Kramer/Kiesling Tile laying trilogy...and the heaviest.

Players have 6 action points to lay tiles, build palaces, add and move developers, draw celebration cards in order to score VPs.

The chunky tiles add to the 3D element which is very crucial in determining who has control over a certain area (the person who is highest up has control). There are many ways of scoring (lakes, palaces, celebrations) and each person has a limited supply of smaller versatile tiles to use.

Analysis paralysis will rear its ugly head late into the game as spaces on the board get limited and each player tries to optimise their actions. The 3D element will really add to the difficulty.

Pros: Very interesting plays can be made (Tigris and Euphrates style shifting of palaces) and the board looks absolutely beautiful.

Cons: The game really really really bogs down due to AP. If we could shave 30-45 mins off the game, I would rate it 1 point higher.

Végre kipróbálhattam a Mask sorozat egy másik tagját a Tikalon kívül. Sajnos már olyan sokára, hogy a Tikal pontos játékmenete is a feledés homályába vész. A Javában kerteket és városokat építünk 1-es, 2-es és 3-as elemekből álló hatszögekből egy elég nagy táblán. Célunk paloták felhúzásával és ott ünnepségek tartásával pontok gyűjtése, illetve a játék végén a birtoklásukkal növelni az eddigieket. Egyedi játék a Java, még akkor is, ha a hat akciópont és azok elköltésének lehetősége szinte egy az egyben a Tikalból vett. Érdekes dolog a játékban az ünnepség, mert egy teljesen szerencsefüggetlen játékba ezzel hoztak szerencsét, szerintem egyáltalán nem hiányzott belőle ez. A játék teljesen egyedi látásmódot követel, mert tulajdonképpen három dimenzióban kell jól látni ahhoz, hogy jól tudjunk gazdálkodni az építési lehetőségeinkkel a körünkben. Ezért egyértelműen rétegjátéknak tartom. Számomra ezen kívül a játék fő problémája a hatalmas AP veszély. Hihetetlen sokat lehet a körünkben gondolkodni nemcsak a 6 akciópont elköltéséről, hanem főleg a helyes építkezésről. Nagyon hosszúvá teheti ez a játékot és nagyon nagy holtidőt adhat 4 játékos esetén. Talán 2-3-an lehet igazán jó a játék. A Tikal ezen a részen jobban átgondolt, ott nincs ekkora gondolkodási nehézség. Egyértelműen nem az én játékom a Java, nincs érzékem hozzá, de ettől függetlenül egyáltalán nem rossz és nagyon egyedi még a Tikalhoz képest is. Mindenképp ajánlom a kipróbálását. Az 5-ös pontszám úgy jött ki, hogy ez objektíve egy 7-es játék, 1 pont mínusz mert hihetetlen holtideje lehet és 1 pont mínusz mert nem az én stílusom.

Outside of the fact that it is just dowright lovely to look at, this is a stellar game.  It is a shame that I played Tikal first as I ended up avoiding the rest of the series afterwards.  There is a great sense of movement and building to this.  It really pushes a city building feel to a whole new level.  

There are many ways to manipulate the board to your advantage, but like the other games in the series you have to spend time looking for it.

Its a brilliantly designed game, no doubt. But something here is missing for me. I never felt emotionally engaged in the game and was left tired at the end. Also, not too much social interaction in this one. Certainly a mentants delight. That said, it does have a neat area control mechanic and the board is nice to look at.

RATING: 8
I love the design and presentation of this game.  The simplicity of "highest man wins" is a brilliant departure from the standard area majority scoring of Kramer, and the 2nd place scoring makes for a huge end-scoring extravaganza.  I dislike the theming in terms of the "festival" cards, but it works for a scoring incentive.  The only real knock I have on the design is in the way the game works in distinct phases (first the irrigation tiles are scored as quickly as possible, then the much slower scoring by placing palaces and having festivals, and then the points orgy at the end), but it doesn't really detract from my enjoyment of the game.  I love the opportunity to set up and pull off a huge move at the end.

With layers upon layers of tiles, this reminds me of Taluva, but with longer and more complex gameplay.  I really enjoyed it, but I can see the potential for the game to bog down with A/P prone players.  This being the last of the Mask trilogy, I think that I like Azteca the best, as it is the game that seems to move along the quickest.

The game board looks great, the box looks great, the tiles look great, but I don't care at all for how it plays.  First, abstract tile-laying games aren't generally my cup of tea.  Second, and much more importantly, way too much analysis paralysis.  I don't enjoy games with a lot of downtime, and this one has way too much.

I've only played this three times, but it seems to have as much depth as Tikal and I am looking forward to seeing startegies develop as I play more. I like that elevation matters in this and that you can break up cities rather easily. Java seems a little more complicated than Tikal, so I probably won't be teaching this to the family.

This is a type of game I'm really fond of. Java would be one of my all-time favourite game under one condition: that it is not played at a tormenting slow pace. If everybody thinks through their plans on other players' turns and executes them quickly, Java can be played easily within 90 minutes and is a delight to play. Otherwise, it send me away screaming.

Why this game is adored is a mystery to me.  The festival idea is a waste of time, and it's really a game of two phases: water-postitioning and end-positioning.  It's slow, boring, prone to kingmakers, and whoever seems to be king of the heap always seems to have lucked into the spot.  Terrible.

I've played Java twice now and am intrigued by it rather more than I ever was by Tikal.  I liked it more than Mexica, too, and I don't like Torres at all.  So make of my comparisons what you will.  Java is the first one of these I ever wanted to own.

Serious downtime can be expected. It is a quite unique game experience though, and it is really difficult to assess what actions are optimum - hence the downtime. For some reason this is not in print anymore (as of writing), which is a shame since it is the best in "Mask"-series.

Best with 3 or 2 players. 4 players gives you too few turns, and too much waiting time (where you can't really do anything).

[4 plays] One of the heaviest brain burning games you can buy.  A very cool design, nice looking board and pieces.  Easy to learn rules, yet super hard game to play.  Just the right amount of player interaction.  The only downside is that it can have a lot of analysis with can make it take a long time to play.  However, really thinking about your turns is what makes this game great.

RATING: N/A
[RGG 02 edition] {Civilization; action-point, tile-laying, area-control } Java comes absolutely beautiful durable game bits. And it's an excellent action-point system game with a strong theme (developing of the Java land). I like the theme (I really would think I am a prince in the Java land). The rule is complicated but it's not hard to learn and master.

Because players have to take care of 10 possible actions and to plan several turns ahead, the decision tree is quite large; thus, Java is highly vulnerable to analyze-paralysis; esp. when a player wants to do 8 things but he only has 6 action points. Besides, the down time is strong in Java because each player has nothing to do when other 3 players are working.

I wonder if one should get all of Torres, Java, Mexica and Tikal except for collection purpose. It seems only one of these is already sufficient for experiencing.

I think Java is an underrated game because it sounds quite complex and abstract to most people.

I love Java! It is so mind-bendingly awesome. My only gripe is the Festival cards. They are so pointless. I guess they are there to force interaction, but I think there is enough interaction without them, and they pull players out of 'the zone.' I've tried to get people here to explain to me why they are needed or why they make the game better, but have not received an answer. We just play without them.

Purchased used for about $13.33 (part of a lot of three games purchased for $40 total.)  Plays very well.  The first game I played (two players) was pretty much neck and neck right up until the final scoring of the palaces.  I'd like to try it with more players.  I would definitely play this again.  I can see why Java development is such an exciting field ...

On the surface this should be a great game; its mechanically easy and there are tons of options and a need to balance short term and long term scoring (and the board is quite pretty).  However, the sheer range of decisions can make this an extremly analysis prone game, leading to a play experience that's much too slow.

Another winner.  The 3D board is something to get used to but it is so fun to play on.  I have only played 2p so far and it works great.  Our second play become more focused and the placements became better strategically.  I like it and will be playing this often.  Also, I was surprised at how easy it was to teach and how fast it played.  The speed will come down when min/maxing points but it's pretty obvious who has the lead in cities.  It's the extra stuff (irrigation, small cities) that will be tacked on that will slow down the moves.  Overall, lots of stuff you can do and many ways to do it. A good sign.

A really good, if deep, game.  Won't get played a lot, but is good.

I like this description: In Tikal the decision space starts out narrow and widens as you add more workers and tiles to explore until it reaches its zenith in the end game. Java's decision space starts out as wide or wider than Tikal's final state and remains pretty much constant throughout due to its vertical placement options. And, finally, Mexica's decision space starts out wide open and slowly narrows as more and more of the board becomes sectioned off by canals and locked down into districts. Looking at the series in this way, you can begin to see why people may suggest that Java would be the most AP prone of the lot: in Tikal, AP potential appears to rise as the number of options available rises due to increases in the number of workers and cleared jungle tiles; in Java, it starts high and remains fairly constant from beginning to end; and, in Mexica, it seems to slowly decrease, but never disappear, as the game wears on. So, all that said, in considering whether or not to purchase Java based on your experience playing Tikal, you might think about how Tikal feels to you in its final few turns and then imagine starting at that point and stretching it out for maybe as much as two hours. That would be something like how it feels to play Java.

Cracking good game - the development of the board is a joy to look at. The thick, thick tiles are just stunning.  For me, not quite as good as Tikal or Mexica - All three games are thinkers, but Java does not seem quite as light-footed and slick as the others. Just a little too chewy for my liking. I played Java after having played Taluva (which I really love). If I had played Java first, I suspect the score might be a 9.

Haven't played Mexica yet, but I have read a lot of reviews and I believe Java's the best of the trilogy. This might be because my spouse always beats me in Tikal, but Java's literally more three dimensional game than it's predecessor. The only luck factor of party cards can be eliminated easily by investing action points to draw more of them.

Java is one of those games I can appreciate as a very well-designed game, and it's absolutely beautiful inside and out, but I just don't enjoy it enough to play often. It's my least favorite of Kramer/Kiesling's so-called Mask Trilogy - Tikal and Mexica are both "keepers" while Java is going on the trade pile. There's a lot to like here, but even more than the other games in the series, Java seems to incite analysis paralysis and players working out their turns in several ways before they're satisfied, which definitely bogs things down. It's definitely worth a try for anyone who hasn't played, but for me Tikal and Mexica do the action-point-allowance/tile-placement thing better.

Java is part of Kramer/Kiesling's Mask Trilogy. It is very similar to Mexica (which I played for the first time recently). Both games allow players to take actions using an action point allocation system. And both games involve creating areas of value and then trying to control that area to get points during a scoring phase.

In Java you start with a blank board that has a few notable features, a mountain side, a lowland side and three water spots. During the game you'll be putting tiles on the board. Most of those tiles will be the common tiles which are a triangle of hexes showing two rice paddies and a village. You also have a personal set of tiles which include double hex tiles (paddy & village) and singletons (some paddy, some village).

There's a few objectives in placing tiles. First, you can completely surround water tiles for 3 points per tile (if you're adjacent to the water when it is completed). Second, you can turn a clump of villages into a city by building a temple in the villages.

In order to build a city, you must have a pawn present in the village to do so. And you must be the highest person in that village (ties broken by quantity of your pawns in each level). Temples come in the following numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. You can build a temple of value equal to the number of villages in the clump. You get half the value of the temple for founding the city. (Later on you can throw a festival for points if you have the right cards). And if some subset of the villages in a city get cut off from a temple, they can form a new city which opens up a lot of strategic and tactical possibilities.

The game ends when the last common tile is placed. At the end of that player's turn they'll do a scoring round where they get points. Then each other player will have one more round finishing with a scoring round. During the scoring rounds you get points for each city where you have the highest or second highest pawn. But you only score your points on your turn. So while another player may be highest on that city on his scoring turn, when it comes around to your turn, you may be able to make yourself highest again.

I really enjoyed this game. I almost always love Kramer/Kiesling games and this was no exception. I like the action point allocation system that is used in the mask trilogy. The area control aspect of the game was interestingly different from Mexica and I liked the way that things could change and that established cities could suddenly fragment and become separate areas. This is definitely another game with a very simple rules with all the complexity coming from the play of the game (something I'm really coming to appreciate lately).

RATING: 9
My third favorite game.

Bonus: Using workers to create express lanes that your other workers can zoom through for 0 action points, yet block off other players from using the same route.

Bonus: Precise placing of temple tiles to increase the expense of other players trying to steal highest rank from you.

Bonus: Leeching tiles away from village builders who build too thin.

Bonus: The favor cards. In most games, random luck is despicable. But these are irrational gods we're talking about, so it's wonderfully appropriate. It's like the designers built the whole game w/o festivities, and then later added the mechanism on.

Broken: Way too much downtime between turns. Not much you can do to prepare your next move while others are playing. Highly recommend playing somewhere other players can watch TV or play a lighter game on the side at the same time.

First off, beautiful bits.  Secondly, its a lovely and clever mix of Tikal and Torres.  Thirdly, a clever game in its own right, but a bit of a brain burner.

Tikal is the easy access version and will probably see more play.

This is a game where long term strategies give way to being able to recognize and gain from new board developments. Tactics change depending on the board configuration which can change wildly from turn to turn. I taught it to my mother and she loved it.  The rules are easy. As for the final scoring round, it *is* big time scoring but I think it's rather friendly and not as brutal as people make it sound.  As more than one player is allowed the maximum score for each palace, if there is a tie for control all tied players get the max score for their rank which evens things out.

Beautiful looking game with quite a bit of strategy and tactics. Similar in looks to Tikal, but gameplay is quite different. I like it better than Tikal, because it is less luck-based (in Tikal, you definitely need some luck drawing tiles). You do, however, need to play this game relatively fast (to prevent analysis paralysis), and preferrably with four (the party-mechanic isn't done any justice otherwise).

This game is a gem and action point systems are really a hit with me.I like this game more and more with each play. Downtime in this game gets progressively worse with later rounds, but can be alleviated with gentle pursuasion or with a timer. Overall, my impressions of this game is excellent and highly recommend this game to folks who love action point mechanims.

It is hard not to use Tikal as a reference when commenting on this game.  I own Tikal, but have not played as often as I would like, and have not played the Auction version.

I thought Java was very good.  It is an action point game, like Tikal, but most of the actions cost just a few points.  Movement of pieces is much less restricted, and less movement is required since you are competing for height, not numbers.  You can also put several terrain pieces down per turn.  In general, you get to do quite a bit more per turn than in Tikal.  I found myself having more AP problems than I had during Tikal, but that was mostly as we approached the special scoring at the end.  Tikal has several special scoring rounds, so while the length of the AP was less, it happens more often in Tikal.  I guess as long as the other players don't mind, that just means the game is engrossing.  Finally, I think the rules in Java are a little more complex than Tikal's, but the game play is a little more focused.

This was a pretty heavy game for our group, and our group often has 5 people in it.  This probably means it won't come out quite as often as I would like.

I think I had too high expectations from Java, but I actually didn't like this more than Tikal. The 3-dimensional board play is really neat, but it's that much harder to figure out good play. There is a much bigger difference between what you need to do for the endgame scoring which is a huge amount of points and what you need to get points during the game which was also a little jarring. The festivals feel a little out of place too, which isn't helped by the lower quality of the festival cards. Overall I think the theme is much stronger in Tikal, where you really get a sense of exploration and excavation. While Java looks amazing, I feel like I'm playing a much more abstract and disjointed game.

Incredibly rich city building game from Wolfgang & Kiesling. Having played the other games from the trilogy and Torres, the action point system here was not as intimidating as I had expected. That said it is the open ended structure coupled with tile placement which make this game feel more thoughtful and dense than the other games in this set. Ravensburger's
components are impeccable and sturdy. The rules, aside from a few points, are well organized and written. While not as compelling to me as Tikal or Mexica, Java is a substantial entertainment for those who want a good brainburner. Not exactly pulse pounding but worth the time invested. And the more time you invest the better it gets. Takes about two or three plays to really take hold.

With the use of a very creative and artistic board, Java provides a fun and competitive play. There are many ways to screw over an opponent and many ways of getting points. It not only starts off in a battle to get civilizations, but in the beginning and end so it provides a intense battle most of the game. Very fun and highly recommended

Unfortunately, the one time I've played was subject to some of the frequent criticisms of the mask trilogy -- too long, overly AP-inducing, and dry.  I hope that this will improve with more familiarity, but I will say that I'm not exactly chomping at the bit to try this one again in the near future.  I think that even if I do get the perfect situation, it's not likely to turn out to be my type of game.  I like a little more chaos and luck and interplay of personalities, and this game is only a hair's breadth from an abstract.

RATING: 7.5
I got it because it was out of print and the reviews said it was a heavy game. I like it but I think Tikal is a more "fun" game. By fun, I mean more accessible to others to play with. I certainly like the spatial aspect to it but I have been lucky enough to play with quick players. Only played with 2 and a couple of solo rounds. Would like to try it with the sweet-spot of 3.

Tried it with 3 now and it is really great. I think with the fourth player it would take an extra 30-45 min which may make it a bit too heavy time-wise but I would suggest playing this with a group of people that are not prone to AP. I can't believe we finished a game in 90 min (including rules explanation). The other 4 games took at least that long with 2.

Deeply engrossing for spatially inclined gamers. I love how the board develops firstly via the opportunistic enclosure of lakes, which then creates a challenging landscape for the growth and segmentation of villages that players vie for control of using their workers as well as by collecting cards for the festivals. All around a smooth playing and very satisfying package. Scratches a unique itch.

Wolfgang Kramer & Michael Kiesling;  Each player, as one of the Javanese rulers, tries to develop the region for himself. Each wants to bring his culture and control to these undeveloped areas. The players irrigate the land and cultivate new rice fields. They build villages, palaces and create cities from the villages.Each desires to be the dominant force in the development of this new area. Players earn fame points for building and enlarging palaces, for creating irrigation systems, and for arranging palace festivals. The player with the most fame points after the final scoring is the winner. Category: City Building;  Mechanics: Tile Placement, Action Point Allowance System, Area Control; second game in the Mask trilogy (but this is the best)

Finally got this to the table.  Played 3P and it was quite fun, although we played a "learning game" so it wasn't too competitive.  We started out individually then spent most of the latter half of the game discussing how to maximize everyone's positions with different plays. I expected to like it, and I did.  I think I might even like it more than Tikal.

This game has it all, but beware the final scoring! If a devoloper sneaks up on you the palace is no longer just yours, and you could lose the game.

The game has a new personality with 3 players- I actually like it better as a 2 player, but the scoring is much closer with 3 people.

I own both Tikal and Java. The theme combined with gameplay of Tikal just grabs me more. I've played Tikal many times and Java just once; Java maybe deeper in strategy but not in 'how do you feel when playing a game' as Tikal is for me. In Tikal I feel myself more involved.

I've played it for the second time. To play this game well you have to consider many possible ways to build, really many! It's a real brain-burner. Not always suitable for 'your average little gamer'. Like to play it again when I'm in the right mood.

This is a fine game.  BUT, it is not quite my thing.  I am not excited about games where players get to do 5 or 6 things, and there is always a "perfect move" for that player to do.  These games always seem to bog down and just lack a certain "fun" factor.  A perfect example of this is Torres, which I just don't like at all.  In contrast, while Reef Encounter has the same type of system, it manages to keep the fun factor for some reason.

We managed to play a game of "speed java" and it confirmed for me the earlier review - it is just too prone to AP to make it fun.

The luck factor is very low, and based on the total number of choices each move and the strong influence on the game each move can make, this is at least a Medium Heavy game, since there is a bit of luck of the draw with the festival cards.

I finally managed to play this long awaited title.
It's exactly the kind of game i like but one play is not enough to judge it, i am quite overwhelmed buy the shear number of possibilites even with so few elements. Of course it is AP prone (a lot) but at the same time it flows quite well, rules aren't too difficult and the playing time is not too long (but it's not short either!). Components are wonderful and the game itself reminds of a mix of Tikal and Taluva. Almost certainly rating and comment quality will raise with more games and yes, i will definitely play this again!!

[EDIT]: played it in two. I'd say it's more a 3-4 players games

Hex tile placement and tile stacking for dude area influence strategy to completely develop the arid region of the Java island game board with rice paddies and villages.  Back and forth shouldering in and leveraging other player developments using action point turns to expand and upgrade villages to cities, build palaces, expand irrigation and throw festivals with card auctions at the palace.  AP moments from big player turns to best spend six action points--so have your cellphone handy.  A little too dry for me and shows its age with today's advancements in design.

Good game I think but it was a brain burner for my group when we were trying to learn and play this. It was a victim of our partying I think - we just were not in the right state of mind to fully appreciate this game. This game looks so good though - love the artwork. At some point I will give it another try but others in the group vowed to never play it again while holding their hurting heads. Proves the point - always be careful pick the right game for the group you find yourself gaming with. I rated it a 4 not because it is a bad game - more that it did not "do it for me" though I hope some day to take it out and give it another go.

Played for the first time. This is most certainly a well-developed, well-thought out and balanced game. However, it fell flat for us: the game was just too slow. I play more slow games (Goa, Ora & Labora), but it felt like this was dragging more than most other 'euro's' I play. During many other games, you can plan ahead and can device multiple plans according to what your opponent do, but that's way more difficult in Java since you have no idea where your opponents are gonna build on the board. Turns drag, since everyone is constantly puzzling: how to make those cities bigger? Which land pieces to use? How do I get the highest rank in that particular city? The players try out dozens possibilities during their turn, rotating the pieces and weighing off choices. And then, at last, they make their decision, after moving pieces around 50 times. It's just excruciatingly slow. The board is totally different when your turn comes around again and turns sometimes take more than 10 minutes (with analytical players). I guess a timer would work, but what's the fun in that? Maybe less action points during a turn would help, or less 3-way tiles to go through (everyone was constantly asking: how many do we still have to go through? What? We're not even half-way through yet? Bleh...). There are better games to play, so this one will not hit the table again: I'm selling it or trading it away.

7 after 1 play.

Gameplay is interactive and tactical in nature. Downtime is very long, which coupled with its tactical nature, means a lot of waiting. Scoring lakes seems to be important in the early stages of the game, while jockeying for position in established cities becomes increasingly important as the game progresses. For such an old game, the component quality is reasonably high. It takes a little effort to make out the level of the tiles and what has been placed on top thus far (to make sure one is not breaking the straddling rule).

I've tweaked down my rating.  It has solid strategy, but it's a bit dry and quite long, with a fair amount of downtime as each person gets pretty hung up on point-spending per turn.  I like Tikal somewhat better, thematically anyway, but I haven't tried either this or that game with more than 2 players.  I suspect that may change the feel a lot.  Spectacular appearance and presentation, though.  I love these games for their look if nothing else.

Played several times now and I really enjoy it.  Actually seemed to move smoother and faster than Tikal.  The endgame turns into a bit more of a brainburner than I like, but seems to hold everyone's attention nicely.

Unimpressive as a 2-player game.  The irrigation tile scoring seemed awfully powerful and easily abused.  The festival competition felt out of place and poorly implemented as there was no point nor incentive to share it with the other person.  Did not really care for the multi-level tile placing gameplay either (same with Taluva).  Would consider trying again with more people, but at the moment definitely prefer Tikal over this overrated title.

There is no other game in our collection that stayed unplayed for such a long time as Java did. Bought this one back in 2000, just after I bought my copy of Settlers of Catan. As I just loved that game (we played it almost every week a couple of times), I wanted to own a game that was different. Went to the gamestore (never heard of a store that just sells games at that time), and asked some information about games. At that time, Java was packed back into the box again, after a demonstration of this game. He recommended that game to me, and was willing to sell the demonstration copy to me for 25% of the price of a new game, which came down to a price of 10 Dutch guilders (we still used guilders back then, instead of Euro’s. 1 euro = 2.20 guilders) I decided to do, and happy as a kid, I went back home with my new game.

I started to read the rules. And I started over again. And again, and again. I just didn’t understand the rules of this game. They didn’t make any sense to me at all. This game was placed at the bottom of the closet and stayed there.

Then it became 2006. Since I purchased the game, I met M., started to live with her in one house. Moved to Eindhoven, and played every now and then a game with her. Prices of boardgames are doubled in a couple of years. In 2000 I bought Settlers and all of it’s expansions (which were available back then), for 150 Dutch guilders (=EUR68). If I want to buy them now, they will cost me EUR167,- We decided to play Java, and I start to read the rules again. Still they didn’t make any sense to me. M. read the rules, she didn’t understand them, and there Java went again at the bottom of our boardgames (I guess we owned about 20 at that time).

Then it became late 2009. Since the last time, again a lot has changed. We purchased a couple of games that we liked very much, and that were fun with just two players. Boardgames didn’t became more expensive the last 3 years. We discovered that there are crazy people in the world, who have a boardgamecollection of over 400 games. We decided to give it a try again. Read the rules. Didn’t understand them. M. read the rules. Didn’t understand them. And back it went again. To the bottom of our increasing boardgamecollection.

Now we write late 2012. Again a lot has changed. Boardgames are still having the same price as they had in 2006. We met a man, who we cold crazy because of owning over 400 different games. We joined a gaming club, of which we became the first international members (and still are the only international members). We are looking for solutions on game-storage, because nowadays we belong to the crazy people in the world ourselves as we own almost 400 games. We’re supposed to be to be experienced players. We teach games to other players. Why has Java become such a frustration to us? We bend over to the bottom shelf and grabbed the box. Opened it. Carefully, because we were afraid of the fact that we didn’t understand the rules again.

Read it again, and a big surprise. We understood the rules. Started to play, and 45 minutes later we came to a conclusion. This game is very easy to play. No fun at all with two players. Result, back to the bottom of the shelf, where it probably will stay for another 12 years.

An uninspiring first play. 

Positives: 
The rules are simple and straightforward even though we were only told about the final scoring halfway through the game. Also i like the visual representation of Java on the board with the rice puddies/fields.

Negatives:
The constant counting of APs is a pain especially when you also need to count the movement of your developers. You can easily lose count. Not to mention that in practical terms it's a big pain to undo actions with the way you place hexes on the board. 

It's also very difficult to plan ahead as the board constantly changes. In of itself this isn't necessarily bad as it forces players to adapt the board but it's annoying if you've spent 5-10 mins thinking about your moves only for the board to completely change by the time it's your turn. 

Finally, having personal tiles left at the end is huge as you can change the board and the majorities when others can't do anything about it. Another effect of not having been told about the way the final scoring works.

Conclusion:

I do enjoy the interaction of the game but at the end of the day the thinking involved in this game bores me. It's accounting. This game has not aged well. I prefer Tikal even with its analysis paralysis and downtime.

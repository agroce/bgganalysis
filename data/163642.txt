Surprisingly brain burny for such a charming presentation. The game plays smoothly, but like some expanding worker placement games, to maximize your placement late in the game requires a lot of calculations on options. Some will find this extremely enjoyable, but it will tend to create longish turns. The plastic modifiable workers is clever and well implemented - along with a few other novel ideas. Overall, quite fine with a huge stack of station models, variety of replay is built right in.

Chimera Station is an accessible mash-up of tile placement and worker placement. It also brings a few other twists/gimmicks to its point-salad-y package. The modding of workers and availability of action combinations make for a satisfying experience that can be enjoyed (and understood) by a wide swath of players. Taking place over 5 rounds, the game exhibits a pretty good arc as you're able to build up to some large point explosions. There's a good mix of tactics and strategy at play during the rounds, though the strategy is more present when you play with the B-side of the player mats. The tile-laying and displacements allow for positive interaction between the players, through there's still plenty of room to play spoiler by building certain tiles and maintaining the first player marker.

The rulebook does leave you with some questions. Also, if you compare Chimera Station to other broadly similar hybrid-style games--like Manhattan Project: Energy Empire (worker placement and emerging action combinations); Carson City (central board tile placement and worker placement); Troyes ("worker" placement and emerging actions); and Ginkgopolis (tile placement)--Chimera Station feels the least strategic out of that bunch. Chimera Station seems to lean more towards allowing the players to experience the chaos of the emerging combinations than other similar hybrid-style games. Though those games are heavier to varying degrees and, aside from Ginkgopolis, play a bit longer and are a bit less accessible than Chimera Station. Perhaps a good comparison is Lords of Waterdeep with the Skullport module added in.  Compared to that game, Chimera Station plays in a bit less time and feels, perhaps, a bit more engaging through its action combinations. LoW: Skullport, though, provides a bit more room for subterfuge between the players due to the hidden faction and intrigue cards.

Het spel bevat interessante elementen, zoals het toevoegen van tentakeltjes en breins aan je mannetjes, en is een leuke WP die goed vooruitgaat.
Toch voelde er ook iets stroefs aan: de kaarten die je gekocht/gekregen had, worden vergeten (door alle spelers).
Ik moet het zeker nog wel een 2e kans geven.

RATING: N/A
Chimera Stations is a worker-building and worker-placement game where players are using their aliens to collectively build a space station. It's not cooperative though; you want to do the best job of building the station and managing your aliens. We played the "advanced" game where your type of alien has a special ability. For example, leafy aliens can spend food like it's money; the brainy aliens don't lose a component (brain) when they up their research track. The worker-building part of the game is pretty neat and the components are fun too... colorful and playful. Put the leaves on your alien and you don't have to feed them; add a brain and they score when visiting a space station; put some claws on the alien and they can go where they want, kicking out other workers. Because you can add two components per alien, you can get a double brain alien or double tentacle alien which provides other, special benefits.

The rest of the game feels pretty similar to a lot of Euro games and that's not a great thing. There are cards can give players their own, personal worker-placement location or a repeating benefit during the game. Some of the cards are interesting, but they seem to be too unbalanced (or I played wrong in my one play).

I would try it again if the opportunity presented itself though I'm concerned it may be underdeveloped.

*6* (Initial plays)
After first play I don't see my rating going up any. Rating will likely sit at 6. The game was entertaining and had many ways to score points, which I like. The components are great and the attachable parts certainly add to the enjoyment of the game. In a weird way it reminds me of Imperial Settlers, the decisions in the beginning are minimal, but towards the end there are many choices. Also, like Imperial Settlers, there's not much players can do to stop a runaway leader. There are some good decisions to make, most of the time it's evaluating which spot will reward more victory points, and there are a lot. Most of the game and time is played on the last 2-3 rounds. The first couple of rounds there's not much to do and the rounds end quick. I can see this becoming slightly repetitive, even with the tiles coming out in different order. Overall, I enjoyed my first play for the most part and wouldnt mind playing more if in the mood.

Just received my kickstarter "deluxified" copy and everything looks great. I have not played the game yet so this "review" is purely on the components. The box has a really nice green foil border which adds a nice touch. The box  art is ok and conveys the game. In the kickstarter copy there are nice metal coins that have "chimera station" included on its engraving. They are a nice heavy coin and feels great. I do have a very big concern for this game regarding the actual chimera pieces. They are very tough to snap into place and if you are not careful you may pinch your skin and cause injury. They are even harder to seperate. It is not impossible but certainly requires a bit of strength. I have only snapped a few on and played with removing them and already have irritation on the side of my finger. I want to play this with my wife but I am concerned that she will struggle with it and either hurt herself or I would have to assist her. Certainly kids would have trouble with this as well. I wish they were made of some soft rubber that easily popped on and off with a little bit of force. They would be soft in hand and still look great. Right now they are a thin hard plastic. Wooden tokens with stickers are acceptable. Next step is to read the rule book and try the game.

RATING: 7
Worker placement in which the workers can be adapted all through the game by adding brains and different kinds of arms (not weapons, but the parts of the body to which hands are attached). As such you can instill your workers with a variety of useful properties.
During the game all players together build a space station by placing hexagons on the central game board. Each hexagon is a different work station for your workers with specific properties (some give you money, others food, these are the 2 resources you need to keep your victory points machine working, and yet others allow you to gain points, change your workers...).

Liked it a lot. However, after 3 games I have to conclude that the cards are not balanced at all. Whereas some will give you advantages that will lead to tons of VPs during the endgame , some don't really do much. And whether you get such a card or not is basically luck. Shame, as it  would have been a 9.

Die öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunksender produzierten in den 70ern und 80ern fantastische Science Fiction-Hörspiele. Mit ruhiger Hand wurden kritische Inhalte in eine ruhige, akustische Form gegossen. Die Kunst skizzierte eine ferne Zukunft, der wir heute durchaus näher gekommen sind: Automatisierung, Digitalisierung, Genmanipulation, Klimakatastrophe, Medien, Vergreisung. Im ausgesuchten Kulturauftrag hatte aber auch die lustige Seite der Science Fiction ihren Platz: Die Hörspielumsetzung von Douglas Adams "Per Anhalter ins All" aus dem Jahr 1982 durch Ernst Wendt mit der Musik von Frank "Derrick" Duval in der Co-Produktion von BR/SWF/WDR ist unerreicht. CHIMERA STATION ist das Brettspiel zum Subgenre. Lustig, vergnüglich und verspielt bedient es ein funny Science Fiction Setting und erteilt Grobmotorikern und Wurstfingern eine feine Absage. Die Chimären sind nämlich bunte Plastik Worker aus dem Ferrero Kinder-Überraschungsei, die man sich zum Construction Placement auf der Raumstation selbst zusammensteckt und individualisiert: Gehirn, Tentakel, Photosynthese-Hände und Klauen machen Extra-Fähigkeiten. WP aberwitzig? Big Idea! Kiddy Style goes Adult Strategy. Das erste Gamers Game, das Lego verbaut. CHIMERA STATION nimmt sich selbst nicht ganz so ernst und zielt dabei gleichzeitig auf den Vielspieler, dessen Spielprofessionalismus es konterkariert. Dabei hat es neben seinem kindlichen Charme rein spielmechanisch auch die üblichen, schönen WP-Klemmigkeiten: gute Felder sind immer besetzt und man möchte mehr tun als man kann. CHIMERA STATION spielt sich in fünf raschen Runden recht zügig, schwingt mittelgewichtig und ist mehr taktischer denn planerisch-strategischer Natur. Diejenigen, die gerne gute Gründe finden neue Werke auf neue Mechanismen abzuprüfen, um Spiele auf die Goldwaage zu legen, schneiden sich hier ins eigene Fleisch ihrer Kindheit und verpassen einen komischen-kosmischen Flug ins All, dessen illustres Wesen man sonst nur in den intergalaktischen Bars von Galacity trifft. Über Raum und Zeit erhaben. Ein fantastischer Spieleabend mit Arthur Dent und Ford Prefect.

Prelim rating. Love the engine building aspect, and find the theme cute. This is primarily a tile laying game where you buy the tiles via worker placement actions that get you the resources you need, then place them for bonuses. There are many ways to juggle the pieces you have to manage. Plays very differently at different player counts (LOT tighter with fewer actions).

Played again at 2. Enjoyed it. The game is somewhat chaotic due to what tiles and perks come out, but it's still very puzzly and fun. Rules need to be tightened up both in how it's written and addressing corner cases. Needs an FAQ badly.

Played a prototype, and wow: really impressed.  Normally I'm extremely skeptical about kickstarters, but this game deserves to be backed and played.

It's a game that follows the "victory points a plenty" or 'victory points salad" formula that Uwe Rosenberg or Stefan Feld games are known for.  There's tons of different ways to get victory points and resources, and after one playthough I feel like I only scratched the surface.  Sadly, I don't have a copy, because I feel like just setting up the board and trying out some strategies.

Workers can be configured in 16 ways, there are 50 (?) different action spaces (partually and gradually introduced during the game) and 25 (?) different perk cards (also partually and gradually introduced during the game).  Optionally there are 4 different races.  Almost all of these are impactful on the game, and (though I've only played once), it felt well balanced.

There is potential for AP here.  On the same level as for instance Le Havre, Tzolkin or Tikal, so I don't think it's problematic, and the AP depends more on the players than the game.  Given that this game revolves around almost endless combinations of workers, action spaces and perks, it will be tough to analyse everything.  But let me not overstate things: our first game (four players: one with 3 games under his belt and three new players, two of those players who suffer from AP in general), excluding rule explaining but including counting score took 2h22m (yes, I time games ;-) ). That's okay, I think the advertised 60m-90m time is very accurate when playing with fluidly playing players.

Are the customizable workers gimmicky?  I don't think so.  It's the same as the dials in Tzolkin, the addition of some plastic makes the game play a lot more fluidly, and it is indeed an integral part of the gameplay.

Overall, highly recommended.  Don't let the cartoony artwork fool you, splice some extra brains on yourself, 'cause you'll need them.

The idea is neat, but the game just bored me. There's nothing interesting to it, despite the option to generate different workers (that ain't so different in the end). It's all about getting food and points in a boring way.

In dem Spiel kann man seine Arbeiter mit Zusatzfunktionen ausrüsten, damit sie beim einsetzen Zusatzressourcen erhalten, Andere verjagen können, Punkte erhalten oder nicht ernährt werden müssen.
Wärend dem Spiel kommen immer mehr Aktionsfelder rein.
Leider ist es oft so, dass es ein vermeindlich gutes Aktionsfeld gibt und sich alle darauf stürzen. Das macht es teilweise etwas kaputt, aber man kann darauf auch reagieren. Ich hatte am Ende die Fähigkeit, dass meine Arbeiter nicht mehr vertrieben werden können, so wollte ich die vermeindlich starke Aktion blocken. Es kam nicht mehr dazu, da das Spielende erreicht war, aber es gibt solche Möglichkeiten.
Ich finde das Spiel sehr gut, auch wenn es auf Extremstrategien abzuzieheln versucht, aber das ist wenigstens mal etwas ganz anderes als ständig der gleiche Worker-Placement Kram.
Es wird dennoch verkauft, da mir zu verstehen gegeben wurde, dass das Spiel nicht so gut sei, auch wenn die Ursache dafür nicht gefunden wurde. Schade, aber ein Spiel, das nicht gespielt wird hat auch kein Platz im Regal, auch wenn ich es gut finde.

If you like tactical worker placement games with a game of chicken thrown in, this is the game for you. If you instead were looking for more for customizing special abilities via the chimera parts as I was hoping it would be, this is not it.  There are only 4 different types of chimera parts here and while all fairly different none really blew my socks off. Instead, you just as often seem to want to deconstruct your chimeras to go up on your science track, as this can give a lot of lucrative points from maxing the track or getting scoring objectives. The other main ways to score points, building tiles and the "command" actions I see as a game of chicken, the former because you get the most benefit if you move your building guy to the tile you build, but if someone really wanted to block someone off they could forgo the bonus to block the space. Meanwhile, the command actions generally give more points later in the round, but wait too long and someone will take the spot(s) before you do. This definitely adds a lot of tactics along with the other interlocking ways to get resources, but it is not something I am interested in.

I also am not a fan of the artwork.

Very original worker placement game where you can configure your workers (robots) as you wish during the game. 
A typical game takes between 1 and 2 hours. In that time you have a very limited set of actions
You don't get the time to get bored during this game. A balance need to be found between investing and harvesting points. Details will decide on who wins; 

I really love this game.

Solid game. Worker placement once again, here the thing that is different is it has custimizable workers. Nice production. But science seemed extremely strong. Our single play on convention had one guy win with a huge margin, while going for science. So some concern about that. Hopefully there are other strategies that we didn't discover, but that are equally strong.

Chimera Station is a worker placement game with customizable workers and an ever-increasing set of possible actions. Players start out with three plastic workers, and not only can they gain more workers as the game progresses, they can also gain "components" which can be attached to the workers to give them special powers, such as bonus resources, points, or the ability to kick out other workers. The initial set of possible actions is pretty limited, but players can build (and immediately use) new action hexes from a display that have a variety of interesting action possibilities. There are a number of different ways to chain placements or actions, which feels really good when you can pull it off. I thought this game was fun and clever, however, it seemed to have a bit of a snowballing issue, and the game lasted a little longer than I would've liked.

Cool looking game. Had some Kickstarter trouble and controversial lack of communication by TMG.

The genetic components are what make this game and are the eye-catcher, because for the rest it's a very classic worker placement game with even a feeding phase at the end :-)
My only worry after 2 plays is, if the command station is in fact the only place that really matters (after some workers have been placed) as the number of points you can get from there are very easy to get in comparison to building for example, but you have to wait for a while off course before you can go there, so timing will be crucial (or having claws :-))?

Yay New arrival from TMG. I have to say I hate the Alien theme. I am not into space, but good thing for me since I don't care about theme in my game play. The game play is worker placement and it is awesome. You are upgrading your aliens and then downgrading them for better benefits! It is a lot of planning and minor take that. Really clever mix of choices and actions you are taking. I had a great time playing this one and I think it works well with 2p. I look forward to lots more plays.

Das Thema hat mir leider nicht ganz gefallen- zumal ich denke, dass man sich von den interessanten Komponenten beeinflussen lässt. Kein schlechtes Spiel- aber zu unübersichtlich.

The build an alien/ snap on appendages was fun. But I’m less and less interested in games requiring you to learn a ton of different powers. Also a little long for my tastes (2.5 hr) even w 3.

Building the space station was a lot of fun and gave interesting new actions, but upgrading the workers was a smaller part of the game than I thought. Some of the buildable action spaces were not as interesting as others, but the game is good nonetheless.

[u]The Positive:[/u]
:) The big plus of Chimera Station is the limited play time (70 min with 4 players is realistic!) and  easy learning curve, despite the complexity and depth this game does offer. [b]True gamers will enjoy the depth and possibilities offered by this game, but also occasional gamers will enjoy playing this due to its accessibility[/b].

:) The cartoonish style can put certain people off, but it works for this game. The [b]components are durable and fun to play with[/b] (you can literally customize your workers by adding leafs, brains, tentacles or claws to them). The iconography of the euro edition is intuitive and clear.

:) Game turns move [b]smoothly and quickly[b], there is very little downtime

:) Set-up is very dynamic, you will be playing a different game each time you set up depending on which modules become available to build and which cards enter the game. It is also possible to play with unique abilities for each faction, adding to the [b]replayability[/b]

:) There is a [b]feeling of growth[/b] during the game: more modules and corresponding actions become available, your workers become stronger, your technology becomes stronger (generating more abilities, workers, ...), ...

:) When played correctly, you can set off chain events in which you generate a ton of food, points, money, robot parts (or a combination of all those) with one single action. Talking about [b]satisfaction[/b]!

:) Don't fear opponents claws: yes, they are used to scare off your workers, but that actually is a good thing: after all: you have already played your action, and workers who get scared away return home via the 'lounge', which means they come home with additional income or food, which is actually useful. There is [b]no direct negative player interaction[/b] in Chimera Station, adding to a [b]fun and friendly atmosphere[/b]

[u]The Negative:[/u]
:soblue: The game only lasts 5 rounds, so don't get too attached to your upgraded workers, as you will only be able to use them a couple of times. For me personally, [b]the game might have lasted a little longer to feel more engaged and attached with what is happening[/b].

:soblue: It is a bit unfortunate that [b]only 3 upgrade worker spots are available per round in a 4-player game[/b]. Yes, this opens the race to those spots early on in the game, but it saddles the 4th player up with something of a disappointment early on in the game.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
Chimera Station offers a huge amounth of depth, complexity and possibilities for a short and very accessible game. Its rules are pretty simple and straight forward, yet it offers a full-fledged challenge. This is one of those rare titles in which veteran and occasional gamers can come toghether and enjoy the game. Personally, I enjoy games which last a little longer: it's easier to get involved in a longer game and I prefer to enjoy early investments during more game rounds. However, it is remarkable that this game has a game length comparable to a filler, but feels like playing a serious strategy game. This is remarkable and certainly adds to its appeal. I can see Chimera Station being enjoyed by a wide audience of game lovers and getting a lot of plays due to the limited game length and considerable replayability.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) Obviously 'long term' investments such as worker upgrades, technology, ... need to be made as quickly as possible.
(*) Should fate decide you will be the 4th player in the first round, consider taking a robot component for a starting condition. That way, you can still install a worker upgrade with your first action.
(*) Beware for food requirements early in the game: without any leafs on your robots, they will require lots of food, which can be a challenge to collect early on in the game
(*) Building modules is a very powerful action and can often trigger 'chain events', but often requires a lot of money.
(*) It is obvious, but still: keep your workers with claws to be placed after all the others. That way you can select action spots which are already occupied. Always look for an opportunity for easy points by going to the command station with a clawed worker to generate a lot of points for a big space station filled with opponents workers!
(*) Don't underestimate the power of additional brains, but as a strategy game fanatic, you probably know this already ;)

A neat worker placement game.  The game accelerates at a satisfying pace, so you don't feel like you are grinding along, and every placement feels important.  The gimmick of modifying workers is quite interesting.

A few tiles that can come out can swing the game.  E.g. converting sections to 7 VP each can wildly change which early game strategies were effective without any possibility of advanced planning.  Most tiles do not have that kind of swing, so this is fairly rare.

Played the prototype several times and enjoyed it very much. Very easy to learn but every game is different. A lot of possible combo's to gain a lot of points.  And the minion-like minis are awesome.

I'm a bit disappointed in Chimera Station. It was fun to play, but there were two things that felt pretty wonky with the game. The first were the action spaces that encouraged you to pull pieces off of your workers, which just seems weird, and pushed the game in a direction I'm not happy with. The second were the command modules. I guess I prefer worker placement games where the action spaces give you things you can use to ultimately score points rather than just scoring points directly.

This is a fun game!  I love the components and the theme.  It takes a little bit (at least for someone like me) to grasp the rules and gameplay, but once you do, it's a simple game to play.  But, while it's simple to play, there is a ton of strategy in this game.  I don't mind the high scoring, but it's on you to make sure you take all that your due!  I highly recommend this game.  It will be played a lot in my house.

Chimera Station feels like another kickstarter with good ideas and rough execution that could have potentially used a lot more playtesting.  I really like having workers that you customize to do different things, and each customization seems fun an useful.  I like the way the pieces fit together, and overall I like the look of the game.

I really dislike both the beginning and the end, though.  I may be wrong after only one play, but it really seems like you can snowball a big lead through cycling money through buildings. Building a building can often give you back money, which is what you spent to make it, leading you to being able to use most of your workers really efficiently.  If you get left out of this process, you are likely going to have a really hard time, and the game is going to go for 4 more rounds.

Usually in worker placement games, there becomes more available spaces over the course of the game, and the complexity of your choices grows along with your number of workers.  Chimera Station takes this too far by having just too many spots to be able to go.  If your group is building a lot, and they should be, there will be a huge number of choices in those last few rounds, and the downtime could potentially be huge.  Our group moved fairly quickly, but I still felt some amount of drag.  I prefer something like Anachrony, which gives you more workers, but starts to shrink the main board while potentially expanding only your own.   In fact, I just prefer Anachrony.

Oh, and some of the game end scoring cards are hilariously better than others.  And the rulebook leaves quite a few questions.  The game is just in much rougher shape than I'd like to see.

Played at Spiel '17. Very much enjoyed the game. It starts off very slowly, but ramps up pretty quickly. Building your workers is the most interesting part of the game. It felt however pretty easy to feed your workers and do great things at the same time. Wouldn't have mind it if this was a bit more difficult. A little worried about the replayability of the game, because we already saw a lot of what the game has to offer.

tl;dr: pretty cool worker placement system

This is a pretty standard worker placement game with a fun twist: you can customize your workers to get better abilities and bonuses on certain actions. There is a good amount of turn angst going on. The length and complexity are average and thus the game doesn't overstay it's welcome.
I'm not sure about the end game though. There is one spot that will give you significantly more points the later you use it. So everyone will try and activate it on the last turn, and more than once if possible. It feels a bit like the rest of the game is setting yourself up for that big last turn. This could be a wrong impression though, after just one play.
I enjoyed this and would like to play it again.

Great components. The attachable parts certainly add to the game. 
Plenty of decisions to make, most of the time which will reward more victory points, and there can be a lot of choices, later in the game. Also need to feed your workers.
The building tile and command placement, introduced a game of chicken and timing as when was the right time to gain points before someone beat you to them.
First few rounds are quick, not much to do, really preparing for the last 2-3 rounds.
I found myself siting, frustrated, wishing I could pull off the combinations the people in front of me were getting. Certainly a point salad game.
There didn't seem to be much players can do to stop a runaway leader other than sacrifice your own placements by beating them to their high scoring spot.

Nov, 2017 (Arrived). 
Jan. 2018, bumped rating from 8.5 to 9. My solo variant has turned this from a solid game that I'd like to play when I can into a go-to solo game! It's so fast to set up, and the Automera plays quickly, so I can easily play in an hour or less. Most of my solo games take longer than that. Love this game! I just wish it had better player support!

So cute! And such a fun mechanic. This game is so full of difficult choices—it really triggers analysis paralysis. Mechanically it’s a simple worker placement game but we have no idea how to play it well—and that, I think, is a good thing.

The plastic alien pieces are adorable and so much fun to assemble—if a little too difficult to attach and separate sometimes. And the illustration is wonderful: quirky, fun and really well done.

RATING: N/A
Fresh facelift on hex tile and worker placement to build an alien space station and splice and disect aliens to leverage worker productivity .  This is a parfait of interesting layers of game play; adding bonuses on the empty station hexes is a great idea and made even more interesting as the benefits increase further away from the command central.  Potato man workers to add and remove genetic modifications adds another strategy variable. Has a bump mechanic that I always enjoy in worker placement.  Has a dizzying number of worker placement spaces as modules are added to the station.  Add the research track to gain perks with even more worker placement choices and there becomes a serious AP danger but it is great for replay variability.  Too bad the starting station couldn't have different starting tile placement bonuses.

RATING: 4
Looked really interesting originally - I pool building worker placement game. Set in space. However, the gameplay felt really fiddle as workers could be taken back and replaced, could get bumped from spaces, and new workers came out. Way too much downtime as people began to AP looking for optimal chains. Definitely not recommended for four and I don’t plan to revisit this one.

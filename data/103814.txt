Easy Game to pick up. Takes less than 5 minutes to play.  Allows unlimited number of players as well.  Great game for a party, or to choose who gets to choose their Christmas Grab Gift first!

Excellent multi player game and when I say multiplayer it can go up to 99. Fantastic put the right number in sequence bingo type game. Great filler. Everyone I have introduced it to has gravitated to it and has wanted to order it.

Fun enough quick filler that works well with the kids.  Has a little bit of the feel of Qwixx and Finito, but I'd probably choose either one of those games over Streams.  Good components, works well enough, just nothing too special.

This game has been a hit with my family, so I may be rating it higher than I might otherwise. Players are likely to take similar approaches, so the luck of the draw seemingly determines the outcome. On second thought, maybe you can develop a strategy that will give you an edge based upon the odds of certain numbers being drawn, much as you would count cards in Blackjack.

Very light game that can play a ton of people at one time..the box says up to 200 but that would be pure chaos.

The game is very easy. You have 20 spots and are trying to get ascending sequences. A tile is drawn with a number from 1-30. One tile for 1-10 and 20-30 and two tiles each for tiles 11-19 with one wild tile thrown in for good measure.

A number is drawn and you write it in one of your 20 spots. Try to get the highest sequences and score. A 10 minute fun fest.

It's like Bingo, but with (some) strategy. Great filler, particularly if you have a huge crowd.

If you own Take It Easy or High Score, there is no reason why one would ever need Streams, though Streams easily accommodates an unlimited number of players. It's easy to teach and moves quickly, but ultimately harmless, inoffensive and devoid of charm.

This game excels when you have lots of players, as it's almost limitless in the number of players it supports.

This game is alright.  Definitely a good game to bust out in a large group as maybe an icebreaker or something.  Very simple game, but love the push your luck aspect of this game.

Une sorte de loto avec des chiffres, mais où on choisit de positionner les jetons tirés où on veut (sachant qu'on ne peut plus les déplacer par la suite). C'est simple, très rapide et il faut tenter de faire les bons choix en fonction des statistiques. Un jeu pour toute la famille.

Not that exciting of a game, but it can play as many people as you have writing implements in roughly log(n) time, which should never exceed 7 minutes IMO. Makes an excellent side game when you're playing with AP-prone folks.

More a puzzle than a game. It has the same strengths as bingo - easy to teach, easy to play with really large groups, doesn't require player investment - and, compared to bingo, is actually interesting. Don't think I'd play outside of that setting though.

Quick fun game that can be played easily from 1 to 30+ players.  I love these type of games.  It reminds me of Finito, Take it Easy, Fits, Bits, Wurfel Bingo, Mosiax, etc. where everyone plays off the same information.

A Bingo-like game but with some actual choices. The game is still light and simple, but I enjoy the simultaneous play and the cute mix of theme, luck, and playing the odds.

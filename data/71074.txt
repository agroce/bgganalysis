This one has been on my radar for a while and finally got to play it thanks to Dice Tower Con. Nice little race/tile placement game.

RATING: 9
NW Passage has a really cool combination of action point management, press your luck "race" scoring, and set collection scoring.  The freeze/thaw line moving each round is genius, it is an elegant way to create a dynamic board state while strengthening the theme.  I also like the tension of taking extra actions for extra cost; it makes placing a new tile while you are sharing a space a tense decision since you could get snaked out of an opportunity.

1st play: A Matagot game I'd never heard of before.  After the success of Giants and loving Kemet and Cyclades, I was excited to try this one out.  Neat mechanic with water freezing over and getting your boats stuck.  Being able to double up actions when needed is cool, and everything feels 
like a race.  The components are great, and it feels thematic.

No 2nd play: I think probably eclipsed by other Matagot titles, but I would play this one again if it was put on the table.  I won't seek it out though.

It's like M. Tourigny played Entdecker, and said, "Hmm: I could make this game a lot better; and I'll move it from the Caribbean to the North American Arctic." The result?: the best exploration game I have ever played and the best tile-laying game I have ever played! 

There have been a number of people who have said it's not a good two-player game. On the contrary: it's fabulous regardless of how many players you have! It is a radically different game with only two, though. In two-player ENWP, each player has to do a lot of work, since with only one opponent, they haven't placed as many tiles that you can take advantage of. There's still just as much competition. With many players, you are competing over the stuff that's actually near you; in a two-player game (where players are normally a good distance away from each other), you have to watch every step they take, since they could get a runaway lead in a particular area. You need to find ways to compete with the opponent on every level in a two-player game; in a multi-player game, there are areas you can safely ignore.

As for the complaints about a lack of strategy (particularly that the player who first gets to the Northwest Passage wins) and a lack of re-play value, that's just not true! Reaching the Northwest Passage does NOT guarantee victory unless the other players are playing poorly! Victory depends on you choosing the path (both literally and figuratively) that your opponents are ignoring; and that particular path is going to change from game to game given how different the board will be every single time. It is remarkable how simple the rules are, in light of the game's strategic depth.

Very well-themed, and exceedingly beautiful board and bits! Even the box insert is a work of art!

Pretty fun but mostly good because it is simple to teach.

Was expecting it to play more like a race but ends up as more of a set collection game, which isn't a favorite of mine personally.

A tile layer that is also a race is at least unusual.  Also unusual about Northwest Passage is a degree of thematic fidelity: our race is to discover the Northwest Passage and then get back to Greenland to report the discovery.  Freezing and thawing as the seasons pass is handled simply and well.  Plus, the game isn't just a race; there are significant points to be earned from lesser discoveries and set collection. There are some nice decisions about how to spend a limited number of action points and the timing of your actions to avoid setting others up to score.

Plenty of positive points, so why do I rate this game only a six?  Because I question its replay value.  There will always be a race to the Northwest Passage and the only other viable strategy I can imagine is to go off island building and set collecting on your own.

This being a Matagot game, it is well produced with decent artwork.

I like this game as the theme shines through and it isn't too abstract or "pasted-on": there is a map (built Carcassonne style as you explore), a tense race element, and various strategies are apparent, so I look forward to playing again.

A very worthy design with good components and well integrated theme.  First game played with four new players. You really do feel like you are struggling to sail through icy waters to discover the Northwest Passage.  And the seasons mechanic with essentially 90% of the water on the board freezing over is very nicely implemented and highly thematic.  Well done.

In our game, it seemed like about 75% of the brain power used in the game was dedicated to shopping for uniquely configured icy land/water/bonus token tiles that either fit the board and/or your eventual intended route...or didn't.   So, in terms of mental energy, this is a tile shopping, and tile laying game. Can't say that I found that I loved that process on first play, but on further plays I warmed up to it more.

Allowing players to "shop" for Carcassonne style tiles sounds like a good idea, kind of like an improvement over basic Carcassonne such that here you are not limited to one tile, but instead, can shop for among 4-10 tiles each turn, which presumably should ameliorate the "luck of the draw" feeling/problem that some associate with basic Carcassonne.  In practice, however, in our four player game, it still felt to me that "luck of the draw" determined the four large tiles available each turn, especially when it comes to the tiles with bonuses on them WITH the proper "fits in the puzzle" configuration of land and water.  If they come up on your turn, you are very likely to reap a lot of points, and feel great.  If they do not, the cost for essentially getting a "nothing tile" for two AP's felt very high indeed.   

The bonus tokens mechanic at least when playing with four, felt a bit underwhelming like a grudging, albeit necessary, addition to provide multiple paths to victory with the added problem of feeling too luck driven in the middle and end game, as only certain "I hope it is available to get on my turn!" bonus tiles will fit the board.  Perhaps many of these problems were attributable to the fact that we played with four, and the board got very crowded?

The action point mechanic and ship versus sled crew were reasonably well implemented. The meager punishment deduction of leaving your ship behind for only -2 victory points, (and taking your sled with all crew members back to Greenland over the frozen waters) combined with the seasons, did seem to possibly favor a dominant strategy in our game, causing me to wonder a bit about replayability.  

I would probably play Northwest Passage again (perhaps with 3) to see if my first impression was mistaken; thus, gotta give it a 7.  

Update after playing with 2 players, I would say that this game plays much better for me with 2, with less tile constriction going on, and more of an engine building feeling, as each player can develop his/her own routes.  And the luck of the draw factor felt greatly diminished. Maybe 3 will play even better.  I like the mellowness of this game, played with 2, just sailing for things to get/discover and getting back alive!

The problem with this game is that you can win without getting anywhere near the NW Passage. Just keep to yourself, take and place tiles that come with bonus chits, then grab those chits, and also make complete islands for more VPs. Additionally, like other tile-laying games, there are so many tiles to choose from that it's not easy to decide which one best fits those already on the board.

Feels very much like K2 or the cave with a race element. Good exploration game.

RATING: 5
I suspect this game won't get much attention because its tile-laying, which people automatically stereotype as simple and luck driven. But this is a very low luck action-optimization game with tons of options each turn. And the turn-track/weather mechanic is refreshing, new, and makes for some interesting decisions.

So what don't I love? Basically, this game can be broken down into an action-optimization game. Normally, taking-tile/placing/moving is 3 actions minimal. Thing is, if someone takes-tile/places-tile... then it is only 1 action to move into that tile. Furthermore, this piggy-backing "discount" makes it advantageous to do 2 actions in a row (and take the 1 action penalty) in order to steel the loot that another player placed.

Thus, with competitive players, the piggy-back strategy naturally emerges; and thus the game can drag on as players draw but don't place, simply because they don't want to give their opponent an advantage. 

There may be a way around this strategy; Perhaps building a route so your opponent goes away from you may work. But right now, it seems you can simply piggy back on the actions of other players and come out ahead.

This is a tile-placement game with action points, built on a very interesting exploration theme.
The map is built by players as the game progresses, and there is a certain puzzle aspect in it, that works very fine.
But the very interesting mechanic at the core of the game is the "sun-line", shifting at the end of each round, and leaving different portions of the board frozen. Get stuck with your ship north of the line, and the ship is blocked until the ice melts, and the expedition must switch to sleds…
There is also an interesting race aspect, going west then east again, but players can forfeit the west race to come back east first to gain few more points. But there are also various bonus tokens (with increasing value, going towards west) that mix things up.
Summing all up, a good medium weight game, with nothing overwhelmingly new in it, but with fast and smooth gameplay, great theme, and very enjoyable.

First Play: Rules read and explained but all very simple and easily picked up. Crucial to understand end game points and strategy should be backward engineered from that basis. Little point settling on your move until the other players have completed theres. Seems the game is highly prone to AP. I say that because I consider myself a fast player and I was at times crippled by AP.

Lovely components. Tokens could be bigger, fantastic ice/ thaw mechanism. Bought on a trip to Florida, couldn't resist at $34.

RATING: 7.25
This is a beautiful game with excellent production values that employs an innovative mechanism and theme that I haven't seen in other games. The board that you are creating via tile laying changes dependent on a solar simulating disc that is encircling the board.

The gameplay and theme draws you in as you are racing to discover the Northwest Passage and tactically placing tiles which might give you bonus chits that are used for immediate points and majority points at the end of the game. All this is done while trying to hinder your opponents from the same task. 

It is an engaging, tense and fresh design with straightforward rules, notable depth, excellent wooden components and beautifully rendered art and tiles.

Update: This game has been an astounding hit with my game group!

I like the way the theme was implemented and some of the newish (to me) ideas with the puzzle be constructed while players move about the board.  Having workers assigned to the boat versus the sled and coordinating that to work is neat.  I see the potential for massive AP or unforeseen situations where you get stuck.  That might be how it was, but not sure that is what I want from a game.  Also, the take that could be a bit too strong for me in this one.  I'll play again before I determine what I think.  In my first play, I was two spaces from the Northwest Passage and then discovered there were zero tiles that could be played in the necessary space to get me there.  I admit that soured me a bit on the game as, up until that point, I'd seen zero situations where you couldn't find a tile that would fit.  Now that I know better, I wouldn't let that happen again but there is AP potential with that too.

I love it when the mechanics found in euros take on a historical subject deep enough that the theme doesn't end at the title or game pieces. Expedition: Northwest Passage reminded me a lot of Entdecker (another euro I've enjoyed) while also including interesting seasonal and travel-mode mechanics that bring exploration, history, and competitiveness together in one fun package.

This was an alright game... I didnt hate it at all, but it didn't have any spark. It has cool timing elements and a unique action point allowance system where it can be split between 2 modes of transportation in whatever amount of split you want, but it will still missing something.

Would give it another shot, but not going to seek out such an opportunity.

This is an interesting game. I think the game gets more repetitive after more plays in terms of the strategy. I do like it because it is a change from the usual Euro. The game is better with more players because the map usually fills up and it provides for a more cutthroat game. It's a pretty game to look at and the theme is cool but I kind of have to be in the mood to play it.

Lavishly produced tile laying, action selection game. The twist is the freezing cycle, which makes moving with the ship impossible. Thus one needs to manage and synchronize the sleigh and ship movement separately. Other than that, a set collection and majorities VP collection game. For some reason I do not find it more interesting than, say, Entdecker, I think I am growing a bit tired of this VP set collection business. Anyway, a solid game, but not one I need to keep in the collection.

Pretty decent, but there's a lot of jigsaw puzzle type analysis, so mostly fun for people who don't mind that sort of thing. It's basically a race to one side and back, but the cool thing is there are points for each place in going both ways, and you can abandon going to the end and instead try to do well getting back. There's also random stuff to pick up along the way, with increased points towards the "far" side. And the route is unknown to start with as players must collective "discover" (in actuality "build") the map. Not super deep, but I enjoyed it for what it is. It's an action point system, with action points allocated per round, and they're tracked on player boards, and we found multiple times that it was sometimes hard for players to remember to move their workers appropriately. This is a bit of a speed bump to the flow.

Becoming a regular among games played...perhaps because it's still novel in my collection.  But it's definitely a great game.  All I've played it with have caught on fast and enjoyed it.  I'm really enjoying it 2-player.  It goes much quicker than the 3 and, especially, 4 player games.

Initial comments:
After well over 2 years after my first play of this game, I finally acquired it and got to play it again.  It met every expectation that had built up over the long wait between.

I'm looking forward to playing it much more.  This makes the 4th racing game in my collection.  Though this is the first one I ever played among them.  I didn't think I would enjoy racing games until this one came along.  It'll probably never leave my shelf.

As leaders of these expeditions in Expedition: Northwest Passage, players must venture into these hazardous Arctic waters in order to discover Franklin's fate and succeed where he failed – by finding the Northwest Passage. Players allocate their crewmen in their ship or in their sled to perform various actions such as exploring, moving, or gathering clues on the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition. As the game progresses, the seasons will pass and parts of the sea will be frozen, blocking the way for the ships. Players acquire victory points by gathering clues, mapping the area, and – of course – discovering the Northwest Passage. However, in order to claim victory, one has to come back home to the Greenland on time!

This game is beautifully crafted and rendered.  It's got a great feel of exploration and was surprisingly better than I thought it would be.

That being said, I played this with two others and we were all physically exhausted to the point of making weird noises during downtime.  So I can't, by all rights, accurately judge the game because of my state of mind, but it definitely didn't draw me in.  In fact, halfway through the game, I gave up on the Northwest Passage and just went off to a corner somewhere and managed to secure 2nd place.  Probably could have won if I didn't rush back to port (again, influenced by my intense desire to go home to bed).  I dunno if that's a sound strategy, but it somewhat worked for me.  *shrug*

Anyways, i want to try this again when I am of sound mind, but the score remains simply because of how I remember not 'feeling' the game the entire time I was playing it.

I've only played it online.  

The tile laying, puzzle solving, map making mechanic is incredibly fun.  You get to watch the map of the NW Passage develop before your eyes.  And the race theme of having to be the first to reach the Passage is tangible and urgent.   

Unfortunately, the game has a major flaw, which warrants a rating of 6 as opposed to 8 or 9.  The flaw being that there is not much advantage to mapping the route to the Passage.  In fact, the player doing the mapping is usually at a disadvantage.  This results in a lot of stalling and "do nothing" play, which is not fun.

The game could be made better if you were allowed to lay a map tile for free each turn, or lay a tile and move onto it for one action, or simply score points for laying tiles.  Still, it's an OK game.

Love the mechanics, love the theme, but the game is not very replayable.

UPDATE: Have played twice now and really enjoy this game for a straight-forward, singularly focused gateway game with easy to understand and remember goals. The combination of race and playing for points keeps the game tense. 

Great for new gamers or for filler games.

Haven’t played a game yet, but have enjoyed simply pulling tiles out of a bag and attempting to create a full map, then enjoying how the map looks and imagining how the game would play to travel through it. Just putting together a puzzle that can be put together in a myriad of ways to create a myriad of passages is satisfying for me.

Strongly suspect this would be an enjoyable game for jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts.

I like the map building/tile laying aspect, one of the few tile laying games I like since there is an actual theme.

One of our group didn't even bother trying for the Northwest passage, he just went for islands and other tokens and almost won.

Different than other stuff I own.  I could see breaking this out once a year or so to play.

Theme is interesting.

A unique tile laying game where you are also moving your ship through the arctic while trying to stay ahead of the freeze. Feels a bit like a race, although you could also just ignore that part and try to collect points differently.

Here's my problem after my first play of the game: I got to the Northwest Passage and made my way back.  Although I picked up only a few little exploration items along the way, I think I should have won.  However, I wasn't even close!  I was the only way to make it to the Passage and I got crushed!  This makes no sense to me.

I bought this accidentally (there was a good discount at the shop) and it was definitely a good choice! The game is really nice. you don't have to travel to the end, o be able to win. you can also choose a different strategy and still win the game. This isn't too difficult and I love the mechanics with sun and freezing sea.

Rating after 15+ plays. Very good game: the theme is really present and there are some really neat ideas:icing/de-icing with the sun marker; management of ship on water and sled on ice. Finding and placing the right tiles on the board takes proves fiddly at times but it is the key to victory. Being first to reach the NW Passage can prove very rewarding but takes careful planning. Winning by collecting bonuses and completing islands seems to be a viable strategy as well. A very unforgiving and always tense, demanding and involving game that gets better after each play. The only drawback: it can hurt your brains and it is clearly prone to AP.

While I am not usually a fan of tile placement games, this one is so deliciously thematic, cleverly original, fast playing and conflictual enough to make me enjoy it. A lot.

The tile placement simulates your discovery of new sea areas, but you have a lot of control on what tiles you draw and place (selecting from a display and being able to accumulate them in your hand to play later).

The decisions are limited yet quite interesting, balancing the need for point with your advantage in avoiding opening spaces for other players and in racing to be first.

Very fun game.

After one play...I don't know...something about the game doesn't feel quite right. I'm not sure what it is, but it feels a bit lackluster.

Pretty good tile-laying game that feels like a mix of "Entdecker" and "The Cave" (which came later but I acquired first) with less randomness, since you don't draw and try to place tiles blindly. From "Entdecker", it has the sea exploration restricted by the position of the ship (or sled) and scoring points based on the size of completed islands. "The Cave" is similar in the use of action points to move from tile to tile and to retrieve various tokens, including majority scoring, plus the crucial need to calculate actions left to return to base. However, the freezing and thaw of water ways, which can cause your ship to be stuck or strand your sled, is unique. On the production, I'm not much a fan of wooden components, but the two-piece sleds and ships (with brown hulls and sails in the players' colors) are a nice touch.

A beautiful exploration/tile laying/race game with a number of paths to victory.  Play mostly with only 2, and would rate it only an 8 for that player count--as it is mainly a race game with little player interaction at that player count.  But with more players this game shines.  One new player in a 4 player game found herself stuck out in the Arctic with little chance of making it back to Greenland.  Her decision to remain out there and explore rather than try to get home caused her to win the game over the more experienced players who tried to balance exploration with survival.  Would probably play this more and rate it higher if we had a consistent gaming group to up the player count.

I've only played once, but I got exactly what I wanted out of this $30 game. We own Eclipse and like a good challenge now and again, but most days we're so exhausted from law/med school that we'd prefer a game that's shorter and a bit easier to manage.

This game was a good balance of pretty (artwork, that is), varied strategy, and neat twists on mechanics. It was not overly mentally taxing, and to be honest it feels like there are two ways to win (Victory Points and Actually making it to the Northwest Passage and back). Even though the rules say you win by VPs, we both seemed to be satisfied (I lost on the VPs but successfully made it to the Northwest Passage where my boyfriend couldn't). 

I liked this game quite a bit.

I like the theme of this game and sun/ice mechanic is interesting, but the rest of the game isn't great.  Placing tiles yourself is worse than simply letting your opponents place tiles for you and then jumping on them.  Also, for a light game, Expedition takes way to long - easily 2 hours.

I really want to like this more than I think I do.  The tile-laying puzzle is thinky and strategic (way more so than the rest of the game would suggest), and the race aspect is tight and constrained, but the cost of picking up the tokens is so high that it's hard to justify doing anything but the minimum set of 6 and skedaddling home.

I don't know if this means the game is shallow or if it means I haven't played it enough to see the depth.  

I can see why the designer made it with such a scarcity of actions, but I'm not sure it works.

My experience here was what I was hoping Lost Valleys would be.  While similarities pretty much begin and end with the exploration aspects of the game, Expedition: Northwest Passage simply did it better.  It's a beautiful game with decent enough components.  The freeze thaw line is a fresh mechanic that adds tension.  Player interaction is moderate without being obnoxious.  Game length ran 90 minutes or so with explanation.  Thematically it flows without sacrificing game play.  I would think it playable at 2 but ideal at 4.  My first and only play was at 3...we took very different approaches and the scoring remained fairly tight (end game scoring spread was around 10 points).  

I've not played many exploration games but I'd recommend it if that's your thing.  I won't need to play it every game session but we'll probably see it hit once or twice a quarter.  I'll push for this one over Lost Valleys.

RATING: 7
Northwest Passage has you competing to find the remnants of the lost Franklin expedition and, incidentally, succeeding where they failed and finding the Northwest Passage yourself. Players steer ships through the icy waterways exploring (drafting or laying tiles) and collecting 5 kinds of discoveries - Franklin Expedition remnants, Inuits, islands, navigation points, and cairns. The further you get to the Northwest Passage on the opposite side of the board, the more points these are worth. You also collect points (the earlier the better) for getting to the Northwest Passage and for hightailing it back to Greenland. Balancing all of these point sources is the key to winning.

There are two main elements that feel unique to this game. The first is that as you play winter sets in, progressively freezing the waterways until only the very bottom of the map is passable by ships. It will thaw again as the winter recedes, but if your ship gets stuck in the ice during winter, it can really mess with your plans. Fortunately, each ship is equipped with a sled that can traverse the frozen waterways. This leads to the second unique aspect - balancing your action points between your ship and your sled. You have seven crew members that represent action points. When you send out your sled, you divide your crew between them, giving each of your vessels their own personal set of action points. Making sure each will be able to do what they need to do when the ice melts is a key decision point in the game. 

Tiles create waterways and islands as you lay them out and drafting the right tiles for the discoveries and passages you need and positioning them well is a fun challenge - or a brain constipating hell - depending on who you are. I am in the former camp and really like this one. I have some concern for long-term replayability, but it's a minor one.

RATING: 6
Gorgeous presentation with a a good implementation of theme; however, the game itself is rather vanilla. Most of your choices are fairly obvious, and their implementation incredibly straight forward. The last two rounds in particular are largely calculable and thus unnecessary. 

Some (ahem Tom Vasel) have stated how brutal and hard this is. They couldn't be more wrong. You barely interact with others outside of the occasional frustrating tile lay. The game is surprisingly light; think of just a step above Carc. Good next step from entry-level euros.

RATING: 9
A tense game, in which players try to balance their efforts between quick navigation to the Northwest Passage and back and collection of various tokens. One thing must complement the other, because it isn't possible to win by concentrating on one aspect only. Players also need to do as little map discovery, as possible. This usually gives an advantage to other players, however it is an essential part of the game. It is best, when the discovery of the map is done by the opponents, however it is hard to achieve that. To sum up, the game has a lot thinking and analysis of various possibilities, and that makes the game interesting. Moreover, a well chosen theme and the mechanics that suits the theme makes the game even more attractable.

Įtemptas žaidimas, kuriame reikia balansuoti tarp greito plaukimo link Šiaurės Vakarų kelio ir atgal bei įvairių žymeklių rinkimo. Vienas turi papildyti kitą, nes koncentruojantis tik į vieną aspektą laimėti neišeitų. Taip pat reikia nepersistengti su naujų teritorijų atradimu. Tai dažnai suteikia pranašumą priešininkams, tačiau be to apsieiti neįmanoma. Geriausia, kai žemėlapį dėlioja oponentai, bet tą pasiekti sunku... Žodžiu, įvairių galimybių nagrinėjimo ir mąstymo čia daug, o tai daro žaidimą įdomiu. Be to gerai parinkta tema ir prie jos deranti žaidimo mechanika suteikia žaidimui papildomo žavesio.

Feb 4/17, Intial Rating: 6.5. Excellent art, Good production value, Strong theme, and very pretty while playing through the game. The randomness is not off putting and rather understandable based on discovering new territory. 

There are a fixed amount of things and actions you can do per turn, and a fixed number of turns. This is not a bad thing either - and it all plays into this highly thematic game. In fact I rather like the unique ice sheet mechanism, and the possible need to get out of the boat and go sledding around. Time factor wasn't too bad either. 

The only thing holding this game back was I would have liked more meat/more complex decisions. It seemed pretty obvious what the best thing to do was for the most part, so it felt a bit light. Would I play it again - absolutely. If this comes out with an expansion offering more meat I would not hesitate to include this one in my collection. For now though it just hit the post.

I really wanted to love this game. I merely like it. This is one of the few times that I am drawn to the game, not by it's reputation or the mechanics, but by the theme. I love this kind of theme. The mechanic of how the sun moves and the ice freezes is interesting and highly thematic. The game as a whole, however, doesn't completely gel for me. I can't explain why. I liked the game. I would play it again. It's not something that I want to have in my collection, though that could possible change if I got in multiple plays. With just one play I can say this: I admire the game, it's a lovely design, but personally I like it and wish it was more.

Purchased in January 2014.  Finally played it in March 2014.  For me this felt like an expanded game of Entdecker.

I like the changing terrain rules.  I think the game is handsomely produced, although why the score track is so small, I don't know.  There was plenty of room left over for a bigger score track.

The game itself isn't that difficult to learn.  But we had a fair bit of analysis time due to the need to figure out how the tiles might mesh together.

A friend of mine knocked this game because the sense of discovery was missing.  It's a fair knock.  The sense of discovery is diminished because players gather tiles they want and then use them when they find convenient.

Nothing wrong with this game, but it failed to excite me.

Expedition: Northwest Passage, players must venture into these hazardous Arctic waters in order to discover Franklin's fate and succeed where he failed – by finding the Northwest Passage. Players allocate their crewmen in their ship or in their sled to perform various actions such as exploring, moving, or gathering clues on the whereabouts of the Franklin expedition.

As the game progresses, the seasons will pass and parts of the sea will be frozen, blocking the way for the ships. Players acquire victory points by gathering clues, mapping the area, and – of course – discovering the Northwest Passage. However, in order to claim victory, one has to come back home to the Greenland on time!

The most interesting thing about this is that it is something like a worker placement game, but almost everything is a competitive race between players in shared location. It is somewhat interactive, and has two novel elements in the ice tracker, and ship/sled split.

OK, I'm a sucker for polar and Arctic exploration. I've read the stories about Franklin's disastrous attempt to find the Northwest Passage, the tales of the men who tried to find the remains of his expedition and even a fictional horror story about how Frankin's ships and crew were hunted my a monster on the ice. This is right in my iced-up wheelhouse. 
The theme oozes through the game and the components. It's tile laying, it's a race game, it's got set collecting and a beautiful narrative arc. The piece de resistance though is the way that the board "freezes over" as the seasons change forcing the players to move by sled once their boats are trapped in the ice.
It's so nearly a 10 for me. Only a slight doubt about replayability and a slightly wonky scoring system prevent it from boardgaming nirvana. 
You know you love a game when you just want to build more chrome and stuff onto it.

This game doesn't look like much on the surface, but it has some fun and thinky gameplay. You're trying to find the fabled Northwest Passage, as well as traces of the last expedition (yes, just like that Monty Python sketch, so there's no need to post that.) You have a ship, but this far north it's only so useful as the water occasionally becomes ice the ship can't get to. At that point you deploy your sled. How to split your crew between your sled and your ship is key, as well as balancing getting to the passage and getting home with discovering islands and notable artifacts. There are a lot of things going on, but it all ties together pretty well and doesn't feel like just a mish-mash of point-generating elements. Also, the graphic design of the game is quite nice.

I won our first play on a straight race and I was able to catch the other two players with some defensive tile laying, making their progress a lot more difficult, pretty much ignoring all the scientific stuff (and we set the sun up wrong, which might change things a lot)

I hope the balance between racing and exploring is a bit more even - not a bad game at all!

I was initially excited about this find. But after purchasing E:NP I saw some mixed reviews, so I was a bit worried. I think those fears were unfounded, because it was a HUGE hit with my group. The theme is what initially peaked my interest, and this game delivers! I would dare say it is one of the most thematic games ever!! The marriage of theme and mechanics are a beauty to behold, and an extreme pleasure to experience. The exploration aspect is very nice, although it feels a little less "discovery-ish" since you are choosing the pieces and where they go. Rather than revealing them randomly. So it is a little more tile laying than exploration/discovery. The freeze/thaw mechanic is excellent. It is a wonderful production all around. Our group was not convinced that this is a 60 minute game. I would set aside 2 hours for this one depending on player count, and possibly a little longer with first time players/rules explanation. I could have never guessed how well E:NP was received. I look forward to many more plays.

Have more plays than indicated here since I play online at BGA.

Why didn't this game get more attention?  It's great.  I traded away Isle of Skye for E:NP and I'd say this game is a huge upgrade over IoS!  For a tile laying game, this is deeper and has more interesting decisions.

Love the exploration feel of the game.  Easily my favorite tile laying game.  The "freezing" mechanism is extremely clever and requires you to think several rounds ahead to make sure you can get full use of your actions.  Various ways to obtain points so you don't have to "race" to reach the Northwest Passage, which gives you more strategical and tactical options each game.  Interesting decisions on when/where to deploy your sled and how many workers to dedicate to it.  You have to balance taking actions you want/need, but also making sure your opponents don't benefit from them too much. You also need to watch your opponents and try to take advantage of the paths they are creating or making sure they aren't the only person grabbing a particular token. 

Likely requires a few plays to wrap your head around the strategy and what would be considered good moves.  First game may be frustrating for new players since it's easy to get burned by a bad move.  Remind new players they don't need to get to the Northwest Passage to win and emphasize other ways to score points and remind them they really need to try to get back to Greenland.  That may help prevent some frustration.

Very one-dimensional, not enough real decisions. Most of the time you only follow others just to jump ahead of them when they play a specific tile.

After reading the rules this looked like it was comparable in complexity to Carcassonne and similar to it in some ways, both good things. But I missed some major rules (sun rotates counterclockwise, you can alternate turns not just do everything at once, when you go back to Greenland you can't tool around with your sled) and found the whole game to be slightly fiddlier than I expected.

I'd happily play it again, and the second time out I think I could teach it a lot better too. I'm not sure it's great with two, even played right, because of how tight the crewman economy is every turn. And I like that tightness; turn angst is one of my favorite things in games. Overall, I don't love it but I do enjoy it.

No quibbles with the components, though: This is one of the prettiest games I own. Everything has been provided and it's all well thought-out, from the crib sheets on the player boards to the fantastic little sled and ship meeples to the period feel of the board. There's even a heavy cloth bag for tile drawing, complete with an imprinted logo; that's a great touch.

After one play, I evaluated this against other games in my collection that are easier to get rolling and more interesting to play, and sold it. Painful, as I love the theme and the subject matter, but head space is head space.

Only played with two for now, agree that 3-4 is optimal but doesn't diminish the 2 player experience too much. Beautiful components and art, even the box insert is gorgeous. Nice quality too. Goes smoothly once you learn the rules, there can be a bit of piggybacking going on which only makes you think that much harder about when to play tiles and move. That piggybacking may even be an incentive to 'strike out' on your own. Keeper for me and my partner.

Really enjoyable exploration game.  Not for the visual-spatial impaired, if you're not good with visualization of multiple combinations of geometric shapes (e.g. Tetris) you will struggle to take timely turns.  Nice tension in the trade-off between paying extra to go again on a great tile or action you really want as opposed to laying a good for you but not great for your opponents tile that has a chance of being untouched when your turn comes again.  The ice mechanic is highly thematic and interesting.  The artwork is beautiful, and the components are of fantastic quality.

Expedition: Northwest Passage uses known mechanisms but combine them in a way I haven't seen before. It's a race game to find the passage and return home. It's a puzzle game, where the placement of tiles opens (or closes) the passage and also add scoring opportunities for finding things or completing islands. It's a resource management game, where you need to decide how best to make use of your limited crew. I also like the fact that the game board changes in a predictable manner as more or less sea gets frozen.
 
The game may be quite unforgiving as it's hard to catch up if you find your ship frozen or your sled surrounded by open water. I also need to find out whether the game has depth or plays out the same every time. Fortunately the game plays quickly enough for the players to understand the board dynamics and the groupthink and try again.

The theme is very unique and I enjoy exploration and tile-laying games. Two concerns I have heard voiced is that the game is AP inducing and that it can be samey after repeated plays. Still the bits are very nice and the graphic design is a winner and Richard Ham's runthrough made it look like fun.

RATING: 6.5
You are racing from Greenland to the Northwest Passage, then back to Greenland. You have 7 workers on a ship, and you spend actions to move your ship, draw tiles, place tiles, pick up objects on the tiles for points, and finally you can split your workers from your ship to a sled and vice versa. The sled only travels on ice, and there is a disk in this game that rotates around the board that marks which marks an entire section of the board will be covered in ice. Normally you take one action, then it is the next player's turn, but for an extra worker you can take another action before the next player.

Tiles have ice or water, and when you complete an island, you score points. Tiles may also contain symbols which can be collected to form sets. 

You get points for reaching the NW passage, and points for returning to Greenland. 

So it's a combination tile placing game and racing game. There could be some downtime as you try to fit tiles into certain spots. It's an okay game, and generally willing to play it.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Although the base is a tile laying game, it combines several mechanics in a very orginal way.

It is quite unforgiving, you don't want to commit errors.

Not sure if it's desirable to play with more than 2 players (how their actions affect you increases the randomnes, and of course, the waiting time).

Main issue: replayability: you do the same in all the games.

RATING: 6
An action point tile-layer with an interesting theme, racing across an unexplored Canada. Its aided by an interesting timing mechanic ... the sun moves to pre-set locations around the board, freezing everything above it, meaning your ship can't move if it's above the sun-line, it's frozen in place. You have to swap guys over to your sled while its frozen and dash around in that, then get your sled back to your ship when the game progresses and its free to move again, getting all your men back together. Your men are used for actions, be it tile collection, tile placement, place tile next to your ship ... making it a painful 3 actions to get anywhere or do anything. Or just use what other people put out. If you're putting a tile out which has a chip (worth VPs) on it, you'll only want to do so only if no one else is around as they'll probably pick it up before you. You have the choice to go again immediately, at the cost of an extra man, to travel to the location and then again (at the cost of another extra man) to pick up the chip to guarantee it. It's a nice feature, being able to go again, but it gets to the heart of the problem of the game for me, that it's no longer about exploring or racing ... it's about leaching. Carving out your own space to stop other people stealing the stuff you put out, or sneaking in and stealing the stuff other people put out. I don't think there's a lot of merit in leaching games - they don't seem to engender a nice social feel as everyone's always on guard and/or someone's dis-satisfied at being stolen from. The game otherwise has nice components and some interesting mechanical aspects re the sunline, but not enough to overcome the leaching pitfall for mine.

The Franklin Expedition is a VERY interesting story and worth reading about. It inspired me to buy this game which is very thematic... crews racing across the ice to find, and explore, the elusive Northwest Passage.  It's got some fun and unique aspects like the sun tracker that gradually freezes/thaws the map. I also like the option to divide your crew amongst the ship and sled. Ultimately, my rating is mediocre because I prefer dice-chucking Ameritrash; but if you want a thematic Eurogame, it'll be hard to do better than this one.

Purchased 3/20/17 for $34.07 from Amazon.

Tile laying with exploration and action point allowance.  Great blend of mechanics.  And the solar arch system is very unique to this game and way cool!  Huge impact on how you control your ship and your sled.  And it's also a race game, not only against your opponents for points, but against the game itself.  You're trying to make it from one end of the map and back before the end of the 10th round.  Will you make it?  It's tense and great great fun!!

RATING: 6
Based on one play: You move your ship around as you and others lay tiles and you can drop your sled also. The water freezes over so you must time your movements so that your boat or sled do not get stuck as the season changes. You also do not have to go all the way to the northwest passage, but can get points by completing islands and gathering tokens. The tiles are a pain, as they don't all inter-fit and it can be frustrating at times. A nice looking game, but game play is not the greatest.

For sale (preferred) or trade.  Have just played one solo game to learn the rules. I played as a race from Greenland to NW Passage and back, and it left each of the 3 players with extra turns, so I think it is more than a race game.  You must pause your racing here and there to add exploration tiles that will score you bonus points along the way.  Nice theme and game board. Has potential -- hope to try with 3 or 4 players.

A tedious and misleading "racing" game where the winner is determined not by who actually wins the race but by those who can excruciatingly min/max their point scoring under the allotted game time. AP induced gamers can turn a 60 minute game into a 3+ hours slog of tedium and boredom. While the graphic design is phenomenal it does not make up for the joyless experience of making a single mistake and never being able to recover or waiting for AP prone players to finally take their turn.

One of the few games I have bought against the recommendations of the reviewers I watched simply because I loved the theme and graphic design, never again.

Pros:
* Great theme.
* Phenomenal graphic design.

Cons:
* AP prone players grind this to a halt.
* Finding the Northwest passage is irrelevant to winning.
* Chits are way too small.
* No way to end the game early.
* Scoring markers are too small.

Intrigued by a QI episode outlining Franklins ill-fated expedition, enough so to buy a DVD on the subject and become curious about this game. I fumbled about but enjoyed the online play on boardgamearena and as the designer posted the solo variant that satisfied my solo requirements (minimal rule overhead), I decided to buy it when the price was good.

There is a strong vp incentive to go to the NW passage from Greenland and back again, taking note of the sun movement 'freezing' the waterways. Ideally you want to trace a cats eye path down to the left hand side of the board and back up to the right. However the tile draws probably won't let you execute the optimum move, which keeps the game fresh. 

Tokens appear on certain tile placements (thankfully pinned by where your ship/sled is and framed by the board edges), which are a source of vps more so if you get a set (and a majority, if in multiplayer mode). So now the game becomes a heady maximising exercise to determine how much vp for limited number of actions per round. Coupled with the heady orientation of how to effectively fit ice/water parts of a tile next to others (which I don't mind as this is more visual than accounting), the game for me loses its narrative appeal and becomes work-like.

This results in me thinking I'd rather play another tile-layer which is more fun, colourful, tense and has a varied narrative (Lost Valley) than the bleak, almost predictable voyage through bland ice. I realise now I'm more interested in the history itself rather than looking for fragments of the lost expedition in a board game.

Very clever exploration/tile laying game. You get a boat and a sled and a certain number of workers who are on one or the other. On your turn, you take one available action for it's cost and then as many additional actions as you like, paying an extra worker on top of any costs for each. There are points for picking things up, for making it the whole way across the board and for getting home in time. At some point part of the board freezes which locks your ship in place, but allows your sled to walk across the water areas of the tiles. Quick, fun, and very tight!

Action selection and a tile placement game. You're trying to make your way to the Northwest passage and back before the time runs out, while battling with changing weather conditions, and trying to pick up some goodies on the way.

I agree with many of the comments posted here: well integrated theme, a bit thinky, and beautiful artwork.

I also agree with many of the critical comments too: seeing which tiles fit somewhat slows down gameplay, limited replayability, and too few dominant strategies.

The comment from epilgrim's rhetorial question I agree with the most: "Cool looking, but is it fun?" To answer, I don't think it's as fun as other lighter Euro's because it's not very interactive: The interaction comes from competing for various goals and clever tile placement. You can't meddle in your opponent's plans in other ways, especially how your opponents allocate their action points. It looks like other Euros compensate for this lack of player interaction by adding lots of special action cards; fortunately, this game avoid doing this, which makes this game feel like those designed in the early 2000's, which to me is a good thing.

Still, once you've figured out the tactical pitfalls of the game and picked your strategy (going for the Northwest passage or collecting lots of stuff), it feels like players are at the mercy of the tile draws.

As with those comments about winning without discovering the northwest passage, I have no problem with that; the most well known explorers who have attempted that failed to do so but found lots of fame (even those who didn't survive!)

I like this game; it plays quickly and is an interesting puzzle. It's good that it plays quickly because this game is very unforgiving of mistakes. One misstep (e.g., choosing the wrong tile) is often all it takes to lose. There is really very little you can do to recover, and you pretty much know who is going to win from that point; however, it plays quickly so you don't have to suffer for long. The other negative is you have to be careful not to hold up the game with too much analysis, which is possible when you're trying to figure out a sequence of tiles that will maximize points.

I've been reading about arctic expeditions for the past year and man, thematically this hit so close. Artistically it's a sight to behold as well, as per usual for Matagot. Reading the rules though, I got a little wary. It's not about finding the NW passage, but an effiency race for points, one where the score is open info no less. That leads to calculation, and I fear it'll cancel out any tension and excitement of racing to find the passage - the game is just not about that story. Not only that, but you create the map. Players decide where the passage is gonna be.

Amazing how the historical and geological realities are implemented!
Intresting read: Owen Beattie and John Geiger - Frozen in time. The Fate of the Franklin Expedition.

Eventually never printed the print 'n' play version, but bought the game. 

This a very interesting and clever game. The game play is tight, the resources are tight, time is tight. You have to find the passage, and as many leads about the missing Franklin expedition as possible, and you have to get back, all in one season of exploration. This feels very realistic. On top of that the sea freezes over in accordance with the movement of the sun, you can put men on the ice with sledges, but you have to pick them back up before the ice melts.
This game is a fantastic game wich I highly recommend. It is nice to play a game that has a euro feel and at the same time the theme is not pasted on to it!

Fantastic theme and interesting worker allocation mechanism.  The race aspect is fun, but the set collection part seems a bit tacked on only as a way to implement an additional scoring mechanism.  Okay, that's not a completely fair assessment since choosing which tiles to place and where is a key element of the game and some of the tiles have an item of the set.  Choosing and placing tiles can be time consuming since there is a heavy visual-spacial aspect and the stiles are all so different.  Also, there can be some backstabbing on tile placement to screw over opponents.  Even worse, it's entirely possible to get yourself stuck and in a bind!  This game was alright and I'd play it again, but it seemed a touch long.

Such a beautiful game.  I'm happy with this purchase so far, but there is something that makes me wonder if future plays will be so fun.  For now, enjoying it very much and I love how different a feel it has than everything else out there.  I look forward to more Expedition games, by the way ...

This is one to play again to both get all rules correct and to consolidate any learning that I did. I think this game is one that will take a few plays to get one's head around how best to play.

I love the concept and it's certainly unique with its combination of tile laying, action point allowance...and the very interesting freezing/unfreezing mechanism. I like it, but don't love it. This is at least partially because I find tile laying games difficult due to not being able to visualise.

Interesting game of exploration/set collection with tile laying -- like Entdecker, but with set collection instead of area control, and with a cool changing map as the freeze level changes each round. I didn't enjoy this as much as Entdecker, though -- guess I like area control better than set collection? Needs more plays, though; I haven't really figured this one out yet!

Reasons I like this game:
-Beautiful art and high production values of board, tiles, and wooden components.  
-Excellent integration of theme and inspired mechanics (the sun marker/'freezing' the board).
-Action point system provides interesting decisions and rewards careful planning and strategy.
-Tile laying is fun and interesting.

Reasons I hate this game:
-Player interaction is rather limited to stealing tokens or points.
-The tiny tokens are fiddly.
-AP players can cause the game to run a little longer.
-Players with little to no imagination won't 'get' the freezing board mechanic.

TL;DR: Excellent thematic euro-game with innovative mechanics.

This game is beautiful...so well produced...AND balanced. That being said, it is DRY. There is no way around that, this game is DRY. But I love it every time I play. It offers several paths to victory and has a great mechanism with the sun token freezing and thawing the board as the year progresses.

This was an impulse purchase I do not regret.

This is nice game, but I'm afraid it has short longevity… I would like to play it one or maybe two more times and afterwards it would rather start to gather dust on my shelf… Exploration is engaging and well simulated, but in every game you just try to achive the same thing in two-three ways. Vey high quality components, very nice artwork, clear rulebook, big box, looks impressive.

Neat map builder with the additional dilemma over when to move to the sled and when to stay on the ship.
Update Jan 2017 - Sold it as it was just sitting unplayed and unloved. Interesting but ultimately dry. Beautiful looking game though.

The designer has done a nice job creating a viable game based on the theme, with just enough layered decisions to keep things engaging yet uncomplicated.

Solo variant works really well, too!

This is such a beautiful game, cool theme, and I liked how it combined tile laying, worker placement, and the sun mechanic.  I was deciding between this and Lewis and Clark because I wanted a race game with a historical theme.  I went with Expedition because I felt it was more family friendly.  I think it is, but my family didn't care for it.  The game now has an official solo variant but it is not enough for me to keep it.  This game deserves to be played by others so I traded it.  Bummer...this game is so beautiful.  I was able to get Lewis and Clark for a very reasonable price so I will be able to compare the two.

I enjoyed this more than I expected to. Much more.

The using additional workers to take extra turns is a simple, elegent and clever idea and adds a nice timing/race aspect to the game. I'd have picked this up in Essen, but it was expensive and funds were running low.

Super fun!  I love the "seasons" and the actual feel of racing to reach the Northwest Passage and then get back to Greenland.  There are so many different ways to win the game (go fast, collect tiles, explore/complete islands) that I don't see this ever getting old.

What a cool take on the average tile laying game this is. It works so well and is full of interesting choices to be made. NEEDS to be a 4 player game though...don't bother if you have fewer.

Northwest Passage is a tile laying game that purportedly is about getting to the Northwest Passage and back. Except that the guy who won didn't. And the guy who has played a handful of times said that the winner usually doesn't. What I suspect is the best strategy is to go off on your own and start placing and getting the goodies from special tiles, forgo the NP and race back to Greenland. The people who head off to the NP aren't going to be able to compete in the majority competitions for goodies, or build many sets. Which actually makes this game a little less interesting to me.

This is my kind of game: I love the tile placing and exploring aspects! I like to plan several moves in advance. What's also interesting is that you never play alone: you can team up with other player(s) to move faster at first, but still need to find the best moment to speed up and steal your partner the victory, or you can go alone and try scoring bonuses for yourself!

Under-rated. I have mostly played 2 player games, but it would be better with 3 or 4 players.

Edit: 4 players increases the options/strategies, but can make the game too long.

RATING: 4
I rate this a 4 with a heavy heart.  I had such high expectations for this game.  In fact, I had been following for years - ever since it was brought first brought to my attention back in 2010.

I've had four (maybe five) plays, all 2p.  Admittedly, that's not the sweet spot for this game.  Still, I can see issues that are going to be present regardless.

Unlike Tom Vasel, AP isn't the problem I have with this game.  No, moves were fast for the most part.  My problem is that, for such an otherwise thematic game, its story arc makes no sense and its climax is almost vapor.

First and foremost, finding the Northwest Passage doesn't just not win you the game, it very likely can cause you to lose it.  This game is won by pretty much staying in the first and second areas, getting as many point tiles as possible, then rushing back to Greenland.  And it's every game I played.

In just about every tile game I've ever played the table fills up with tiles and you get a sense of creating something.  In Expedition the board is at best 1/4th filled with 2p. You have a smattering of tiles and that's it.  There's very little sense of opening up the map and discovery.

The artwork for this game is stupendous.  The canvas bag, the shades of brown, the game oozes adventure from a hundred+ years ago.  It is the game board equivalent of worn leather you want to put on display.  But the gameplay is just missing something.

I've already tried one variant of trying to loosen up the game by allowing more actions per turn by not having an action penalty.  Unfortunately, that loosened it up too much.  The was no tension and the gameplay was flat.  

I know this game has its fans.  I'm not sure what they're seeing that I'm not.  I play a lot of tile games.  Carcassonne: The City is perhaps the best I've played so far.  City is deeper than Expedition and far far less repetitious.  And that is ultimately why I've thrown in the towel on Expedition.  At least in 2p, there's no conceivable way to get more tiles (and thus more variety and more options) on the board without making the game so loose that it's uninteresting.  If playing this game (again, 2p) means only a dozen tiles get placed every single game then that just sounds boring and uninteresting.  This probably the most painful critique I've made of a game here on BGG as I've been waiting years for it to be released.  And then to see that production values are so beautiful and evocative.  What a shame.

Really think the "ice freezing"-mechanic seems interesting.  I also really like exploration games.  I think I'd be in the target audience of this game, but I'm not sure many I play with would.

A beautiful box, filled with disappointment. Beautifully produced, for the most part (My 'solar disk' was likely painted by a 6 year old); it just isn't fun... it works in a basic sense, but is devoid of any interest or excitement. 2-Player is flat tedium and any more just drags it out. 

Not sure why or how, NOT achieving a goal, or everyone DYING on a recovery mission, can be construed as a 'win'... and constantly searching for the 'right' tile, just to get somewhere/anywhere, is frustrating to no end. Oh yeah.. historical accuracy. Sorry, vested interests, it just isn't working for me. 

And not just me:

Provisional rating, one play (at Spiel). A novel idea, that at different times during the game parts of the board become impassable to certain player pieces, leading to good thematic flavour.  I personally found the gameplay uninvolving, and at times annoying, but others at the table liked it more.

interesting mix of race, tile laying and worker placement, recommended if the theme grabs you (not my case).
2p game is a bit empty, more interesting with 3/4p.
learning curve (needed 3 plays to make it back)

[+] it's a tight game, different paths to victory (even without going all the way to NWP), going by boat or sledge (both are viable)
[-] picking up stuff along the way (inuits, cairns, wrecks, etc.) is not very exiting (to me)

This game is really not for me as I have trouble seeing how the tiles fit together spatially. I wouldn't say I hate it but I also wouldn't play it again. A really long (due to downtime), drawn out Carcassone with different mechanics and economy in action selection. The sun/ice mechanic is really neat actually and the theme and execution are great, but those things are probably the only things I enjoyed in this game.

I love how the race to the NW passage influences the game, yet you can win without ever getting there. The changing seasons mechanic is inspired and helps to really bring out the theme. I think this really shines with exactly 4 players who don't suffer AP nor are spatially challenged.

RATING: 10
Excellent game, with very fine-tuned game mechanisms - following how the sea freezes and thaws during the game, while you have to make crucial decisions when (or if) you shall leave behind your ship as it is stuck in the pack ice and move all your men to the sledge so that you might reach the Northwest Passage on your next turn, almost make you feel the Arctic cold creep up your spine. The competitive tile-management/placement and how you use your resources makes this game really interesting with a lot of replay value.

A simply gorgeous production, this game also has a great toy factor. The little wooden ships, dog sleds and sailor meeples are just a blast to fiddle around with. The sailors do nothing more than track action points, yet they really pull you into the game, especially when you decide to split your crew up and go sledding. It just fires the imagination, which is just about the best thing you can say about anything. The freezing/thawing ice mechanism creates such amazing tension that it truly is an agonizing decision when you have to cut an expedition short or worse, leave someone behind.

Even the tile laying is fun, both finding a path through the ice and laying down point scoring temptations for your opponents to slow them down. It's clear the game was a labor of love just by looking at the box, but I'm glad to say the game play holds up in the fun department even if you have no interest at all in the history of the H.M.S. Terror.

RATING: 5.5
Good theme, good components, some good ideas (most of all the sun and the freezing of water, genius!) but, as a famous author said, it's one of those games best left unplayed. The rules seem great and then the game is disappointing. Slow, very slow, and no one ever wants to lay a tile because others will get advantage out of it so everyone is crowding the westernmost tile until someone is forced to add a tile. It was an unpleasant gaming experience all in all and the rating is almost saved only by the few positive things.
Oh, there are situation when a tile cannot be filled and these occasions are really really frustrating (when, after two paths divide, they join again in a corner where one tile has ice and the other has water. there are no tiles with a corner half ice half water... that's silly!)

RATING: 7
This is a beautiful combination of tile placement, action point management, and racing that might be difficult at first, but is absolutely simple after a turn or two. If you're teaching this game, you owe it to yourself to clarify the flow of the game and how you can take an action and then let the next player go with out officially passing for the whole round.

Cool little tile laying game that feels very thematic.  My only complaint would be that for a game with "Northwest Passage" in the name you should have no choice but to at least get to the other side, thus discovering the Northwest Passage.

Abstract tile placement in the theme of exploring the Northwest Passage to both discover the fate of Sir John Franklin and find safe passage. Action point worker allowance with domino-like tile placement of draft selected water-and-ice tiles.  It is a race across the waterways and ice paths with your ships and dog sleds getting to Franklin sites along the way. The thaw and freeze season phases add an interesting strategy element. Get bonus scoring for set collection goals.

Tile-laying game about NorthWest Passage. I found the game fell flat for me. I thought it was pretty boring, I do not like Tile laying games most of the time.  I also found the game to be quite linear and didn't really have enough decisions.  I don't think I'll be playing it again

Has a few interesting aspects with trying to balance racing as fast as possible against the encroaching ice and lingering a bit to rack up prestige points.  Also need to decide when to take extra actions on your round versus take your time and spend you crew most efficiently.  Had a similar feel as K2 although the games are fairly different.

Ok, not a wargame.
The reason is here is that I am in search of a boardgame to lure two/three teenagers in my family away from their smartphones, iPads, etc. and all get together and have fun.

Beautiful components and by reading the rules on-line I really like many of the design choices.

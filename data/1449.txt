* Cribbage meets Scrabble, but the 5-tile in a row limit fills the board up quickly.  Really needs some markers to block out illegal play spaces.

Great game, Cribbage scoring of tiles played in a manner similar to Scrabble.  Anyone who likes Cribbage will enjoy this game.

Adding Scrabble to Cribbage I wouldn't call an upgrade. I'd still prefer just Cribbage, but this game is alright.

RATING: 6.5
This is a fun, new take on Cribbage, but it plays much differently with different numbers of players. With 4, there's way too much downtime while you wait around for everybody else to figure out their optimal play.  It works well with 2 players as there's little change between your plays and of course less waiting.  No great strategic depth however many play, but it's a good light-hearted filler.  Good family entertainment.  Rating for 2: 8; rating for 4: 5.

This might be OK as a 2 player game, but I've only ever played it with 3 or 4, and at those numbers it's dreadful. A staggering amount of downtime.

A fairly light game. Plays quickly and is moderately interesting. I think it is better than Scrabble but not as good as Cribbage.

Bought new.  My version is called Cross Crib.  A good game.  You need to play with experienced Cribbage players though.

Best to play with a blank board and only allow a max of 5 tiles in a row.

Might be the perfect game for me and my wife. Scrabble is her favorite game of all time, so much so that she'd probably be competitive at professional Scrabble -- yeah, I didn't know you could go pro in Scrabble either, but you can -- so I never have a chance against her and certainly don't enjoy playing her. We both love Cribbage, so this fusion of the two games allows a lot of the tactical fun a Scrabble board offers, without the inferiority complex from possessing the lesser vocabulary.

A successful marriage of two traditional games. Like Scrabble, it's best with two to limit waiting. Scorekeeping is a bit more difficult than in Scrabble.

Very, very cool game.  If you like Cribbage and scrabble, play this game.  I was skeptical at first, but the game won me over quickly.  It is very satisfying to get high scoring plays.  I wish the board was of slightly higher quality, but besides that, the bits are decent.

Obtained in trade.  My wife and I enjoyed our first game quite a bit.  When she likes a game I'm in Geek Heaven.  The game doesn't end for us when the last tile is drawn, but rather when a player plays the last tile on his/her rack.

I love playing Cribbage.  I play it almost daily.  I play at: www.ecribbage.com.  I learned this game off the website!  The only thing I don't really care for about the game is that, the feeling of never catching up if you are like 30 behind.  Other than that fact, this game is a great one!

Scrabble & Cribbage had a baby. It has wooden tiles and a plastic board. It plays very well and combines a good amount of both games. Very enjoyable.

This is a game with similar components and mechanics as Scrabble, but instead of letters, the tiles have numbers and symbols on them like a standard deck of playing cards. Players try to place tiles to create certain patterns horizontally and/or vertically. Engaging, but suffers from a similar downtime as Scrabble.

Interesting take on Cribbage by adding Scrabble-like tiles.  I like it just OK, as I would much rather just get a deck of cards to play my favorite card game.

Looking at the photos there seems to be two versions of this game. 

If you like Cribbage and if you are familiar with Scrabble you will like this game. It's not difficult to play (if you know Cribbage) and can make for a pleasant conversational game.

It is no where near as hard as Scrabble to play, and no dictionary is needed - LOL

Cribbage as a tile laying game. This game rocks! The only real problem is people can over analyse their scoring potential and drag out the length of the game.

I always liked the clever tile placement and scoring aspects of Scrabble, but hated the fact that it could become a contest of memorizing very short obscure words. King's Cribbage replaces the letters with numbers. Done!

I have the original version, and it's completely unworkable.  Judging from the pictures on more recent boxes, the game may have been changed significantly since then.

A fun twist on scrabble.  Forces one to think in a different manner than both cribbage and scrabble.  We quickly learned that the bonus scores are critical to victory

This is a really nice combo of cribbage crossword-style.  It's challenging and fun to determine the best hand with your tiles that does not set up your opponent for even bigger scores.  

I bought this on a whim, but since my husband and I love cribbage, I think it will be a hit.

Royal Edition 2003, by Winning Moves. Shouldn't it be [i]King's[/i] Cribbage? Must be a story to go with that name... Cribbage (simplified), played with tiles and a conveniently rotating, Scrabblesque board (- any scoring bonuses). Simply a must have for Cribbage fans. The only problem with it, is the "easy-seal, cloth bag": the velcro strip closes up in between every tile draw!

Once you have this down, I highly recommend you try this:  [gameid=2398].

This is the Royal Edition, complete and in very good condition.  One of the little grid walls (the width of a tile) has broken off, but it shouldn't impact play.  The box is slightly bowed on top, but is in excellent shape and very sound.

Bought "Ginnykub" at Goodwill, but use it to play Kings Cribbage. My wife and I like Cribbage and this is a fun turn on the game. More like a cross between Cribbage and crosswords than the often use comparison to Scrabble as the board is not used to add to scoring as it is in Scrabble.

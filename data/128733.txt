Nice little assymetrical 2-player game with a theme similar to "The Magnificent Seven" movie. Easy to play, enjoyable but very much luck driven and most choices are obvious. Still a nice card game with quality components and I love the metal box!

Hmm, I don't know what to say about this one. The concept is good, the theme is ok, but it just doesn't seem to work. It was one of those games when we kept going back to the rulebook to check we were playing it right - turns out we were, which isn't good. Maybe this would improve with more plays, but I just can't see ever wanting to devote the time to test that theory. A miss for me.

Good two player game with some interesting mechanics.  I've dinged it .5 for the poor rule book and the strange decision to have one side called the Mapache and the other Malpaso (easy to mix up).

An interesting card game for a Far West theme. The concept and game mechanics although simple and straightforward lack any examples of play. There are some issues in the rule book that require more explanation. Apart from this, the playing of cards is based on bluffing and a bit of luck. This is a balanced game giving both players many alternatives to reach their goal and eliminate their opponent. It is fast paced and intriguing. A nice addition for the card gaming fans.

Excellent wild west 2 player game that we love, love, love. The poker game at the beginning feels a bit tacked on and pointless, and it also seems weighted very heavily in favour of the good Padre. In fact, in all of the games we played the Guardians have always won the poker tournament and we played so much with the same locations that we decided that we'd randomly start with the alternative locations on occasion. Barring that, it's a solid and FUN game with amazing artwork. I mini pimped my game with a Lego cowboy for the turn marker instead of that plain white cylinder. 

Games become very exciting and tense near the end especially if you need ammo for your Gatling gun, or kegs of gunpowder, or more Rurales, or a Kiowa Guide to help the Mexican Army come directly to your aid...SUPER!

I think I like this game more than Revolver 1. The poker tournament doesn't add anything but there are more aspects to this game than Revolver 1.

Blowing up the bridge, skipping fases really add something to this game.  Besides that I think good and bad are more in balance.

A bit more streamlined than REVOLVER. Once again a great looking and playable 2 player-cardgame, situated in Cowboy-country in 1894. This time the crooks are the attackers. The small pokertournament at the start of each game is a nice addition, and determines a part of where the game will be played. Also some small bonuses will be available.

I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected.  It's an Old West themed asymmetrical two player card game, but it's a lot heavier than I thought it would be. A lot of the game is about deciding when and whether to play your good cards; you have to decide in what location you want to make your stand. I think that getting to know both decks would probably improve your chances.  (1 play)

Fun 2 player heads up game with a great theme Ala Magnificent 7. The set up is a little odd and the rulebook is vague sometimes, but one play thru is all you need to sort it all out. Each player feels different playing, which I like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rules as written in rulebook are pretty difficult to comprehend. I recommend watching some video instead. 

The game itself is pretty boring and unengaging if the theme does nothing for you. It basically is all about the hand management, but without the agonizing decisions that are present for example in Battle Line. Due to that the game is boring and feels way too long.

I might like this a little more than the first Revolver, but that's only because I like the movie [i]The Magnificent Seven[/i] more than [i]3:10 to Yuma[/i]. This is a great 2-player card management game. It often seems to come right down to the wire, which makes me think that luck of the draw is a significant factor in who wins, but it's a fun ride and there are a bunch of tough decisions to be made along the way. I really like how all the different cards have flavor and do different things but aren't really complicated at all, and you never have to keep track of more than a few of them. The focus is always on "OK, what am I going to do next?" rather than trying to keep track of the game state.

At first it looks more interesting than revolver but after 2 plays it's clear there is only one tactic to win as attacker and that's the 'save as many cards as possible for Gatling gun and kill everyone in the 3 rounds you're there'.

If you like Revolver, like I do, you'll like this. Ok, the play is basically the same but there's more locations, a Stud Poker Game start to the main game, Mexican hats, and other elements to the game such as blow the bridge, gattling gun and collapse the tunnels. Did I mention there's Mexican hats?

Artwork is gorgeous as ever.

There's enough changes to warrant having both versions.

Enjoyable, accessible and thematic 2 player Mexican gun fight. Something to take on a holiday, play half a dozen times, and not worry too much about when it sinks down the collection... Takes a couple of plays to get a sense of what's what, but limited depth because of the way it's set up. Mainly hand management and a degree of push your luck.

It was about halfway through our fourth game, one in which I was doing well as the Guardians and would eventually win, that I realized I wasn't having any fun. Neither was my opponent. Nor did the other two gamers I played with in previous games. [i]Revolver 2[/i] is not a bad game by any means, it's just that there are so many other, more engaging faction vs. faction games to play, such as [gameID=9446], or [gameID=21241], or [gameID=58281] (although I'm not crazy about the dice in the latter).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Revolver 2: Last Stand at Malpaso is an asymetric game in which players engage in a series of battles at various locations. Each location has a number of turns indicated on it, and once the turn marker is moved to the next location, everything at the preceding location is left behind, and the battle starts from a clean slate. Players play cards with numerical values to the active location, and whoever has the largest sum at the end of General Mapacho's turn is that turn's winner. The General Mapacho player is trying to defeat all of the opponent's Guardian cards, and by winning a battle such a card is killed. The Padre Esteban player, on the other hand, for the most part is trying to stay alive through the last location. The game allows for a lot of excellent hand management decisions, as you have to decide how much to commit to each battle, knowing you'll be leaving those cards behind. Additionally, many cards require you to discard cards from your hand, forcing players to figure out what they will really need as the game progresses. I thought that this was an interesting and well-done game that uses mechanics that I haven't seen outside of CCG's. I can't really comment on game balance at this point.

RATING: 7
Almost exactly the same as Revolver, and hence I like it almost exactly the same amount (which is "a bit more than a bit"). If you don't realise how much it's about bluff and hand management it can see like a game that plays you rather than vice versa so it doesn't go down well with everyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
(5+ plays)  If you like Revolver, you're bound to like this one.  With an entirely new story, but a similar cinematic elegance, this game tells either a horrifying tragedy of thievery and slaughter, or a story of redemption and justice - depending upon who wins.

With a friendly poker game adding a bit of variety to the start of the game (analogous but entirely different from the ambush cards of Revolver 1.1), and a bunch of "true grit" on the early Malpaso guardian cards, you get a bit more attached to your complete gang in this game.  As opposed to the bloody shootout that starts at the bank in Revolver, this opens Revolver 2 with an entirely different feel.  In addition, the cards have new icons for Ammo (Mapache) and explosives (Malpaso), that add a new dynamic to the hand management.

Overall, I couldn't tell you which game I like better, but you can see by my scores - I think this is a great pair of games.  Can I call for a trilogy?

The Poker 'prelude' doesn't add too much, but all in it seems like a little smoother version of Revolver. If you wanna pick just one, I would say go for this one.

I found this harder to grasp initially than Revolver. There are a number of rules questions that crop up from time to time and the setup is a little more involved as you search for specific cards from the deck. I still despise the tin box. That said:

A number of my criticisms of Revolver have been addressed here. The double use of some of the cards to blow up the bridge, mine or make extra kills at the Silver Mine makes the cards more meaningful with regards to choices. The choices are still a little too far and few for my liking. There's the appearance of choice, but after a few games it's too easily identifiable between a good choice and a bad choice.

They're getting there. There's much potential in this system, but at the moment it almost feels like it could be a solo game where you'd get more interesting situations occurring than in a game with players who know the best limited path to take for effective play. Fun for the first few plays though.

The theme seems to gloss over a lot of my problems or questions about this game.

I really like the way hand management is integrated in to this and the option for Padre to stay at locations longer adds a great deal more difficulty in to the decision whether to try and contest all regions. Of course, over invest there and Padre simply moves on...

I'm not sure I really care for the poker mini game, but it is honestly so fast, I can live with it.

I loved Revolver and like Revolver 2. Like the original, Revolver 2 is highly thematic and a great exercise in hand management and tactics. The one downside is that Revolver 2 is structured with some ultra-powerful options at the end of the long battle road - dynamite the mines for the good guys and the gatling gun for the bad types. This has the unfortunate effect of making the final battlefield far more important than any of the others, which makes me rate Revolver 2 one peg below the original. Still a keeper, though!

Jury's out on this one, so far.  I've enjoyed it but it runs a little light for my tastes.  And I feel like both players have to be fully committed to the theme -- if it doesn't involve bad accents, growled threats, and a palpable sense of loss when a guardian falls, then why are you even playing?

Cool stuff, glad I picked it up (five bucks used!) and will likely hit the table again, but I don't think it's something to which I'll circle back again and again.

One play so far, seemed overly dependant on luck of the draw as one side just didn't get the cards they neeeded.  That's not a problem in a shorter game but this was long enough that it started to feel a bit pointless for both sides toward the end. Need to play more.

UPDATE: After three plays, it's for trade. It suffers in comparison with the Kosmos line of two-player games. It seems to drag on endlessly, doesn't have many interesting decisions, and its main saving grace is the kickass theme. It reminds me of a two-player version of Smash Up, a game we also traded because it felt like it dragged on interminably. The problem is that you're pretty-much just placing cards trying to get the highest number in the scoring round and occasionally torpedoing someone's cards. 

**

Made no impression on me whatsoever, despite the wonderful theme and bits. It's not a bad game, just 'meh' compared to my wonderful collection of light two-player games.

I like two-player "showdown" games, especially asymmetric ones, and the first play of R2 showed promise. Some digging through the rulebook was required before the game got underway. The game was settled on the last possible round even though it seemed like I was going to easily defend Malpaso up until the Silver Mine shootouts.

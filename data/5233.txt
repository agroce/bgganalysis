RATING: 4
Not the best entry in the GBOH series. A lot of horrendously unbalanced scenarios, and the rout/recovery mechanism makes no sense in this time period; once a unit has broken, it should be gone. Also highly questionable whether the high degree of tactical control makes any sense. Combined with the length, complexity, and lack of balanced & interesting scenarios, this one is not Berg's best. Interestingly, many of the scenarios become more interesting with Simple GBOH, but not enough for me to recommend them.

This was fun, and I ended up getting other GBOH gmes, but I do think I would rather play miniatures if I had the chance.    But if those aren't available, this scratches the itch.

Great ancients tactical system. The ability to reorganize units may be ahistorical, but it's more interesting, so I'm glad it's there.

The real problem is the scenarios.

See my entry under the Deluxe version. Apart from graphics and some minor rules changes it's the same game.

RATING: 6
Excellent and deep series of games that covers the whole gamut of ancient warfare.  If there is a battle, it&#039;s probably a scenario here somewhere.  Simple GBOH makes the game much more playable with virtually no loss in detail.

I agree with criticisms of the command rules: far too gamey and unrepresentative of the dynamics of battle. I had the original edition, but sold it.

RATING: 8
This is my first exposure to the GBoH series and I played it with the Simple GBoH which I recommend as a starting point.  Lots of difficult choices and a speedy system makes for relatively no downtime which is a commodity for us counter pushers.  Great flow, easy to understand the rules and the look of the battlefield is just right.  I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the scenarios and whatever I can get my hands on.  Very accessible.  Tactically challenging.  Highly recommended.

great game system, but the Persians really don't stand a chance.  Gaugamela is almost too large to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The system is great, Leader activation, Momentum, Trump.....

However, ALL the battles Alexander got superb outstanding command structure, better troop quality in infantry and cavalry, best formation of infantry, the opposite side, poor commanders and command structure, poor troop quality in infantry and cavalry, poor formation of infantry, pursian got out-number compare to Alexander's small army, but number do is not the element help you to win or lost.

Only the battle of Hydaspes was interesting, elepants vs phalanx. Although Alexander also got the superb command structure, the Indian using line commands. This is a exciting battle and the most challenge battle to Alexander the Great.

I got the 1st edition and 1st deluxe edition of The Great Battle of Alexander.

I've only played Chaeronea, but the activation rules give Alexander and, in this scenario, Phillip, a huge advantage over the other leaders.  I don't hold out much hope for the Greeks, but the Game design keep both sides interested, and it's fun to play, even if you're doomed to failure.

RATING: 8
A complex nonetheless dry and accurate wargame.  Realism is the flag of the day.  Fun factor is put aside.  But fun can be derived from the recreation of an intense battle, infantry tactics, critical factors consolidated in one package analysis.  Critical factors include momentum, morale, army rout points etc.  The rout breaking point for whoever gets there first fuels immense flavour to the gaming aspect.  This is by far the most definitive treatment on the ancient battles.  An incredible learning experience.

RATING: 3
Very impressive OOB research and combat system completely let down by one of the most gamey command systems seen in ancients gaming.  Alex with his megaphone has instant control of huge numbers of troops while the timewarps resulting from trumping and "momentum" hide the large attacks that the Persians rode, e.g., at Gaugamela, completely behind the event horizon.  Conversely, troops that are not continuously stroked forward by their leaders simply stop.

Sold it in 1996. Part of a whole family of nice-looking, process-driven, laborious games which appeal primarily to "logisticians" (Jungian SJ-type), like La Bataille. To me this is a toy, not a game.

Here's your chance to show that you're a military genius like Alexander himself.  Can you combine your forces and destroy the Persians?
Lots of fun.
I own the pre-deluxe version so no spiffy counters for me.  Still enjoy it though.

RATING: 6
Tough game to rate, as their are three editions (1st, 2nd and Simple GBOH).  I give the SGBOH verison a 9, the Deluxe Al version an 7, and the 1ed a 6.  In general all editions suffer from the fact that many scenarios are imbalanced.  The original GBOH rules for me are a bit much for the hack and slash era--SGBOH is much better.

The initial GBOH system with double width phalanx counters, but the heavy Greek Hoplite and light Persian armies no match for the Macedonian cavalry and pikemen.

A milestone in the history of the hobby: aside from a handful of sumptuous earlier exceptions, this one put an end on the omnipotent player era. From then on, one just can't accomplish each and every course of action they intend to: resources are scarce and machinations of fate forbidding

This is the first title in the series Great Battles of History (AKA GBoH). I own the first edition that includes dull graphics and flat maps, but also one of the best wargame systems created to simulate ancient battles. This is the reason I rank so high, because, despite its weaknesses, the game mechanics are robust enough to make a great succes in wargaming. Four battles that can be fought as a whole campaign, from simpler (Granicus) to more complex (Gaugamela), number of counters increase as you move from one scenario to the next with Gaugamela as the final explosion. Issus is probably the better known of all. It is famous the graphic refrence of the mosaic in Pompeii http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Battle_of_Issus.jpg The only drawback I find to the game is that it is unbalanced against the Persians. I recommend a little bit of bias  for the Persians raising the routing levels for that army, unless one player is expert and the other novice, giving Macedonians to the novice. Anyway a "must have" and a lot of enjoyment because it is easily adapted to other times and battles in the series.

RATING: 9
Does exactly what a historic game should. It taught me a great deal about warfare of this era. It  illustrates the importance of keeping your terrain flat and open, keeping your enemy in from of you (away from your flanks) and it exposes the achilles heal of the phallanx sytem (difficulty in turning). This game also stresses the importance of good commanders in the field as opposed to the greater quantity of inferior troops. Very interesting game to play!

I played twice same senario included in C3i Mag.(I also uploaded the images.)
Though the tons of GOOD rules and minute rules it have, the continuation roll is heavyly influenced on the result.
An integral organic character of the rules(=the rule tree)is missing in this game,I think.

RATING: 8
Very technical breakdown of the Macedonian art of war.  Nice components and large maps with good historical background; alas, you'll have a hard time finding an opponent if you don't have any grognard friends who enjoy the period and can put in the time.  Also part of a very good computer game series from I-magic.  Very much simplified by "Simple Great Battles of History"

Some scenarios are really unbalanced but the game plays well & fast.
I regret the large number of information counters you have to use for different purposes (step losses, shock,...).
